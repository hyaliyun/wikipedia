During the First World War it operated as a reconnaissance and bomber squadron and in the 1930s operated light bombers. It was re-equipped with fighter-bombers in the later half of the Second World War and in the post-war period was reformed four times; first as a photo-reconnaissance unit, then anti-aircraft co-operation, then as a jet fighter squadron through the 1950s. It was last active in the 1960s, as a Blackburn Beverley transport squadron. First World War No. 34 Squadron RAF was formed at RAF Castle Bromwich on 7 January 1916 from elements of No. 19 Squadron RAF. It went to France in July 1916 as a reconnaissance unit equipped with BE.2s It got RE.8s in January 1917. It transferred to the Italian front flying reconnaissance and bomber missions until the end of the war, returning to the UK and disbanding on 25 September 1919. 1935–45 A Bristol Blenheim Mark IV (lower right) accompanies a squadron of Brewster Buffaloes over the Malayan jungle, late 1941. 34 Squadron was re-formed at Bircham Newton on 3 December 1935, out of personnel from No. 18 Squadron RAF. Initially it flew Hawker Hinds before receiving Bristol Blenheims in July 1938 and was stationed at Singapore when the Second World War broke out. The squadron first saw action in December 1941, against Japanese forces in Malaya. After two months, it had been withdrawn to Sumatra and Java and losses had been so severe that it was officially disbanded. The remaining personnel, aircraft and equipment were withdrawn to India. It was officially re-formed at RAF Chakrata on 1 April 1942 and re-equipped with Blenheims.National Cold War Exhibitions, 2013, No.34 Squadron (31 Mar 2017) In July and August, some of its aircraft were used to attack rebels in North West Frontier Province. From September until April 1943, the squadron carried out bombing raids against Japanese targets in Burma. The squadron converted to the light ground attack role from November 1943, when it began to receive single-seat Hawker Hurricane fighter-bombers. These were replaced by Republic Thunderbolts in March 1945. 34 Squadron was disbanded on 15 October 1945. Post-war On 1 August 1946 No. 681 Squadron RAF was renumbered as No. 34 Squadron, flying photo- reconnaissance Supermarine Spitfires until disbanding on 31 July 1947. No. 695 Squadron RAF was then renumbered to No. 34 Squadron on 11 February 1949 at Horsham St. Faith, near Norwich. They operated in anti-aircraft co-operation using Bristol Beaufighters and Spitfires until it too disbanded on 24 June 1952. No. 34 was reformed at Tangmere with Gloster Meteor jets as a fighter squadron in August 1954. In October 1955 Hawker Hunters replaced the Meteors until disbandment on 10 January 1958. No. 34 was then reformed yet again on 1 October 1960 at RAF Seletar, Singapore, in the transport role with Blackburn Beverleys. In December 1962, four Blackburn Beverleys were used to insert Gurkhas into Brunei to combat a revolt by the North Kalimantan National Army (TNKU) against the Sultan of Brunei.

She was named for Randolph Zane. History Miss Marjorie Zane (right) and her mother, Mrs. Barbara Zane (daughter of California governor William D. Stephens) at the christening of the USS Zane. Zane was laid down on 15 January 1919 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; launched on 12 August 1919; sponsored by Miss Marjorie Zane, the daughter of Major R. T. Zane; re-classified DD-337 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned at Mare Island on 15 February 1921, Lieutenant Commander Philip Seymour in command. =1920s= After fitting out and shakedown, Zane fueled at Port Costa, California, late in June 1921 and sailed northward to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, for stores. Returning south to Mare Island once more, Zane joined Destroyer Division 14 at San Francisco, California, on 22 June and departed that port the following day, bound for the Asiatic Station. Sailing via Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam, Zane reached Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 24 August. The destroyer then operated in the Philippines—out of Cavite, Manila, Olongapo, and Lingayen Gulf—on maneuvers and exercises through the spring of 1922. She departed Manila on 3 June 1922, bound for Chinese waters. Zane reached the Yangtze estuary on 6 June and, while steaming to the mouth of the Huangpu River, en route to Shanghai, spotted the Chinese river steamer Tse Kiang approaching from the starboard quarter. She maintained course and speed, doing nothing to avoid a collision. Zane attempted to avoid a fouling when that seemed imminent, but too late. At 1158, Tse Kiang rammed the destroyer aft. Fortunately, the damage was minor; and Zane proceeded on her way, reaching Shanghai two and a half hours later and moored alongside sistership at the American buoys. Zane entered the Yangtsepoo drydock on 15 June for repairs and was undocked on the following day. Underway for Chefoo on 5 July, Zane reached that North China port on the 7th and remained there until the 30th, when she shifted to Chinwangtao, the seaport at the base of the Great Wall of China, to send leave parties to Peking. She lay at Chinwangtao from 31 July to 5 August, when she got underway to return to Chefoo on the latter day. Zane set sail from Chefoo, homeward bound, on 25 August and visited Nagasaki, Japan, on the first leg of her voyage back to the west coast of the United States. Subsequently, touching at Midway and Pearl Harbor, the destroyer reached San Francisco on 2 October. Shifting to the Mare Island Navy Yard on 9 October, Zane turned in all torpedoes, torpedo gear, and landing force equipment over the three days that ensued. She then fueled at Martinez, California, before reaching San Diego and San Pedro. Decommissioned at San Diego on 1 February 1923, Zane remained on \\"Red Lead Row\\" for seven years. =1930s= Recommissioned on 25 February 1930, Lt. Comdr. C. J. Parrish in command, Zane operated actively as a unit of the Battle Force for the next decade, except for one brief period during which time she was attached to Rotating Reserve Squadron 20 in late 1934. Initially assigned to Destroyer Division 10, Destroyer Squadron 4, Destroyers, Battle Force, Destroyer Flotilla 2, the ship served through the 1930s in a variety of squadrons, but all within the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. She participated in some of the inter-war fleet problems - the large-scale fleet maneuvers instituted in the early 1920s to develop equipment and tactics. She ranged from the west coast of the United States into the Caribbean and western Atlantic Ocean, as well as off the Panama Canal Zone. However, with the new destroyer construction programs turning out more modern, faster, and heavily armed ships, the need to retain the old \\"flush- deckers\\" in the destroyer role diminished. At the same time, there grew a need for high-speed minesweepers, fast minelayers, seaplane tenders, and the like to meet the ever-growing demands on the Navy. =Destroyer minesweeper (DMS)= Converted to a high-speed minesweeper at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard and reclassified as DMS-14 on 19 November 1940, Zane operated primarily in Hawaiian waters on the eve of World War II. Pearl Harbor On the morning of 7 December 1941, she was moored off Pearl City in a nest with her three sisterships of Mine Division 4— , , and . The crew was just finishing breakfast when, at 0757, a signalman on watch topside observed a single plane drop a bomb on the southern end of Ford Island after a long gliding approach from the northward. Only then did the men topside realize it was a Japanese plane. With 10 percent of her enlisted men and 25 percent of the officers ashore, Zane went to general quarters and, within three minutes of the initial explosion, had manned her .50-caliber antiaircraft machine gun battery. Her commanding officer, Lt. Cmdr. L. M. LeHardy, was senior officer afloat in the division and reported: \\"0800 Observed Japanese plane gliding low over Ford Island, enemy character now positive. This was not a drill.\\" Commencing fire at \\"any and all planes which passed within a reasonable distance of the nest\\" Zane began preparations at 0803 for getting underway, as belting and ammunition supply parties turned to. At 0830, Zane spotted a \\"strange submarine\\" 200 yards astern of , anchored in nearby berth K-23. Zane's position in the nest, however, rendered her incapable of opening fire with her after 4-inch gun: her aim was fouled by Perry (DMS-17), moored outboard. However, soon made the whole problem academic at 0840, when she charged down upon the Japanese type \\"A\\" midget submarine and destroyed her by ramming and with depth charges. Meanwhile, the fleet gradually began to return fire and, by the time the second wave of Japanese planes arrived, the fleet was at action stations. Gunfire from a nearby ship (possibly Medusa) brought down one Japanese plane, whose bomb had burst in the water near Perry. The enemy aircraft exploded into flames on the way down and crashed on shore near the recently completed deperming station to the loud cheers of all hands topside in Zane. Subsequently, the ships of MinDiv 4 got underway individually and stood out to take up patrol offshore. Zane had suffered no damage from the enemy during the raid, but the melee of \\"friendly\\" antiaircraft fire from a number of ships nearby, including some in the nest itself, had severed a number of strands of rigging and antennae. At 1410, Zane and Wasmuth rigged up a twin-ship, moored-mine sweep with 400 fathoms of wire between them and entered the Pearl Harbor entrance channel at 1547, sweeping up to the vicinity of the gate vessel before the sweep wire parted. Subsequently, returning to sea, Zane resumed antisubmarine patrols, carrying them out at a time when submarine sightings (most of them fictitious) proliferated. 1942 Zane operated locally out of Pearl Harbor into the spring of 1942. She departed the Hawaiian Islands on 5 April, escorting an convoy (number 4079) to San Pedro, California. The high-speed minesweeper then underwent repairs and alterations at the Mare Island Navy Yard before she returned to Pearl Harbor in early June. Meanwhile, the tide of war was beginning to turn. Eight months after Pearl Harbor, the United States Navy was ready to launch its first amphibious operation, codenamed Operation Watchtower. The target was the Japanese-held Solomon Islands, and the operation was to begin on 7 August 1942. American intelligence knew that numerous unmined areas existed off the objective beachheads, but invasion planners thought it best to at least determine the exact boundaries of any minefields that existed in the areas. Accordingly, Zane and four of her sisterships (, , and ) —were to sweep an area extending from the 100 fathom (183 m) curve toward Port Purvis on Florida Island, but split into two groups near Gavutu Island to head simultaneously toward beach \\"Red,\\" clearing a wide stretch through Lengo Channel toward Indispensable Strait. Japanese shore batteries opened up on the ships, but their fire was erratic and did no damage. By 1550 on the day of the first landings, 7 August, the area had been thoroughly swept. No mines were found. Over the ensuing weeks, the Battle of Guadalcanal was fought, with the Japanese maintaining themselves on the island. The Americans were compelled to bring in their reinforcements during the daylight hours when they controlled the skies. At night, the Japanese, with their superior night-fighting capabilities, had command of the situation in the Solomons. Zane worked off Tulagi and Guadalcanal, breaking her sweep and patrol operations with periodic upkeep at Noumea, New Caledonia. On 8 September, during one such sweep operation, the minesweeper watched waves of high flying Japanese planes heading toward Guadalcanal. Into the autumn, as the fighting ashore became more intense, the need for supplies - particularly aviation gasoline to keep the Cactus Air Force in the air - multiplied. At Espiritu Santo, Zane and her sistership Trever piled drums of aviation gasoline on their decks, together with torpedoes, ammunition and stores, and each with two motor torpedo (PT) boats in tow, set sail for Guadalcanal. They reached Tulagi Harbor at 0530 on 25 October 1942. Trever completed her unloading by 0700. At 0809, the general air raid alarm sounded from ashore. Trever cast off and stood into the harbor itself; Zane got underway about the same time and lay to about 700 yards ahead of Trever in the shelter of Tulagi, Koko-tambu, and Songoangona Islands. At 0955, the signal station at Tulagi informed both ships that three enemy ships had been sighted in the straits between Savo and Florida Islands, entering \\"Iron Bottom Bay.\\" Trever's commanding officer, the task group commander, Commander D. M. Agnew, took a dim view of the recommendation that his ships seek shelter up the Maliala River. Not wanting to be, in his words, \\"trapped like rats,\\" Agnew elected to run. Zane and Trever stood out at maximum speed and cleared the channel leading out of Tulagi at 1014. Lookouts noted the stacks and mast-tops of three ships almost simultaneously at distant and bearing 250 degrees, steering a slightly converging course. Within five minutes, the American lookouts noted that the trio of enemy ships had altered course to close. The three enemy ships (the destroyers Akatsuki, Ikazuchi, and Shiratsuyu) comprised the 1st Attack Unit, dispatched to provide naval gunfire support during the day to Japanese land forces who had hoped to capture Henderson Field. Each of the Japanese ships with their 6 × 5 in (127 mm) guns outgunned their American counterparts who were armed with smaller calibre guns. At 1020, the enemy formation changed course again to close the range still further and bring their heavier batteries to bear. Zane and Trever, meanwhile, skirted the shoal waters on course for Sealark Channel. Ten minutes later, with the range at approximated 9,200 yards, the Japanese destroyers opened fire, and the running sea fight was on. The Japanese - in view of their slated mission - were using bombardment ammunition instead of armor-piercing shells. Soon shells began landing disturbingly close to the zigzagging Trever and Zane; the latter, for example, observed one shell land just forward of her bow and one apiece on each side of the forecastle, off the bows. One enemy shell scored a direct hit on Zane, hitting the minesweeper's number 1 × gun, forward, killing three men instantly. Other shells cut away rigging, antennae, and every halyard except the one to the gaff. That one appropriately flew the national ensign. Providentially, at 1040, the Japanese ships turned away to engage and a small patrol craft off Lunga Point. The respite offered the two high-speed minesweepers proved fatal to the fleet tug and the YP as the Japanese ships sank them summarily before retiring, harried by American planes from Henderson Field. Trever and Zane, meanwhile, continued to retire to the eastward. At 1055, the two minecraft changed course to the south and west of San Cristobal Island. Zane remained in the forward areas of the Southwest Pacific theater through the end of 1942. Again in company with Trever, the high-speed minesweeper towed PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 2 from Nouméa to Espiritu Santo in mid-November. Zane later escorted a convoy from the New Hebrides to Tulagi and Guadalcanal before being sent to Sydney, Australia, in January 1943 for repairs and a rest for her crew. 1943 While at Sydney, Zane was called upon to perform a rescue mission. On 22 January 1943, the Japanese submarine I-21 (a craft with an impressive record of \\"kills\\" since scoring her first on Christmas Eve 1941) torpedoed and disabled the American steamship Peter H. Burnett. The next day, Zane received orders to proceed to the last reported position of the crippled steamer. At 1255 on 25 January, Zane spotted a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Catalina flying boat. She, in turn, led the minesweeper to the location of Peter H. Burnett's lifeboat number three. Apparently, the steamer's crew and passengers had thought the ship would sink as a result of the torpedo damage aft and abandoned her; their ship, however, was still afloat. Zane took on board 14 men (12 crewmembers including the Master, Charles Darling, and two U.S. Army passengers) at 1330 and altered course to head for the last reported position of the ship from which the men had come. The RAAF Catalina then helpfully radioed the position of the derelict, enabling Zane to reach the scene at 1735. She then transferred, via motor whaleboat, 13 of the men back to their ship; one man had been retained on board Zane under medical treatment for his injuries suffered when the steamer had been torpedoed. The minesweeper then took Peter H. Burnett in tow and pulled her to Sydney, where they both arrived safely on the 27th. Zane returned to Guadalcanal in late February. In her absence, there had been a change in the situation on that once bitterly contested isle - the Japanese had evacuated it on 7 February and 8 February, leaving it in American hands at last. With Guadalcanal finally secured, American planners looked toward the Russells, west northwest of Guadalcanal. These isles were chiefly remembered by visitors for \\"rain, mud, and magnificent coconuts.\\" The operation code-named Operation Cleanslate, was the first forward island-jumping movement made in the South Pacific. Zane, as part of Task Unit (TU) 61.1.3, towed four landing craft (two LCVP's, one LCV and an LCM) to the objective area. As part of the \\"Spit Kit Expeditionary Force,\\" the minesweeper thus put into action part of the troops slated to occupy the Russells. On 21 February 1943, Operation Cleanslate commenced but encountered no opposition from the enemy, who had only recently evacuated the islands. As Vice Admiral George C. Dyer wrote in his biography of Admiral Richmond K. Turner The Amphibians Came to Conquer \\"'Cleanslate' went off with precision, but without fanfare or publicity.\\" For Zane, her next amphibious operation was Operation Toenails, the assault and occupation of New Georgia. Zane and comprised TU 31.1.1, the \\"Onaiavisi Occupation Unit.\\" Each picked up a company of the Army's 169th Infantry Regiment and an LCVP in the Russells on 29 June and headed for their objective, the two small islands guarding the most direct approach to Zanana Beach on New Georgia Island. That beach was slated to be the jump-off point for the flanking attack on strategic Munda airfield. Bad weather (low ceilings, moderate showers with corresponding poor visibility, shifting and gusty winds, and choppy seas) hampered \\"Toenails\\" from the start; but Zane and Talbot reached the Onaiavisi channel entrance at around 0225 on 30 June to begin their task. However, shortly before 0300, Zane grounded during a heavy rain squall while disembarking her troops. Nevertheless, the mishap did not hamper the landing process; for both Zane and Talbot succeeded in putting both companies of the 169th Regiment ashore without loss on Dume (later known as Sasavele Island) and Baraulu Islands to hold the Onaiavisi entrance until the shore-to-shore movement could commence to Zanana Beach. Zane remained aground forward until 0523, when she finally managed to back free. However, the high-speed minesweeper grounded aft almost immediately, damaging her propellers. Again she tried using her own power to get free but, despite aid by Talbot, could not do so. Zane's predicament was far from good: she was a sitting duck, only five miles from Japanese-held Munda airstrip. Providentially, as Admiral Dyer recounts, \\"no alert Japanese artillery man hauled up a battery to take Zane under fire.\\" After some four hours, pulled Zane off the rocks. The fleet tug (a former minesweeper herself) then took Zane back to the Solomons for repairs, arriving at Tulagi on 2 July. After enough temporary patching to permit the ship to leave Guadalcanal under her own power, Zane headed via Espiritu Santo and Pearl Harbor to the Mare Island Navy Yard for permanent repairs and alterations. The high-speed minesweeper again sailed westward on 23 September, departing Mare Island, bound for Pearl Harbor. Reaching Oahu on 30 September, she remained in the Hawaiian operating area for the rest of the year 1943 and through mid-January 1944. 1944 to 1945 Departing Pearl Harbor on 22 January 1944, Zane subsequently took part in Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. As part of the Southern Attack Force, Zane was assigned escort duties in the Southern Transport Screen, TU 52.7.1, in company with sistership Perry, four destroyers, and two subchasers (SC's). She screened transports during the Kwajalein phase of \\"Flintlock\\" and subsequently served as \\"sweep\\" ship and mine disposal vessel during the invasion and occupation of Eniwetok. In that part of the operation, she suffered minor damage from exploding mines, some of which exploded within 100 yards of the ship. After returning to Pearl Harbor in March for availability, Zane during the summer participated in her last major operation, Operation Forager. Again working as mine disposal vessel, Zane was part of Task Group 12.13, the Minesweeping and Hydrographic Survey Group. Unit 2, to which the ship was attached, included three of her sisterships: , , and . During the landing phases of \\"Forager\\", which commenced on 15 June when Vice Admiral Turner's Task Force 52 (the Northern Attack Force) began sending ashore the marines under the command of Lieutenant General H. M. Smith, USMC, Zane laid down buoys and destroyed drifting mines with gunfire, working once more as mine-destruction vessel. She spotted several planes attacking the beachheads, but all were beyond the range of her guns. Subsequently, when marines and Army troops under Major General Roy S. Geiger went ashore on Guam on 22 July under the covering gunfire of Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill's task force, Zane worked as an antisubmarine escort vessel, steaming in the vanguard of a reserve transport group, TG 53.19. Significantly, the Guam operation proved to be the last front-line tour for the veteran high-speed minesweeper; for, after remaining in the Marianas until 8 August, she reported to Commander, Service Squadron (ServRon) 10, at Ulithi, in the Carolines, for duty as a target-towing vessel. Zane performed target- towing and local escort duties for the remainder of the war, touching in the Palaus, Marianas, Carolines, and Philippines before V-J Day in mid-August 1945 found her at anchor in San Pedro Bay, off Leyte. During those prosaic but necessary duties, she had been reclassified from a high-speed minesweeper to a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-109, on 5 June 1945. The ship departed the western Pacific in October, beginning her homeward voyage from Leyte on the 13th. After touching at Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego en route, Zane transited the Panama Canal on 25 November and ultimately reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 November. She was decommissioned there on 14 December 1945. Struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1946, the ship was delivered to Luria Brothers and Company, on 22 October 1946; her hulk was scrapped on 3 March 1947. Zane (DMS-14) received six battle stars for her World War II service from Pearl Harbor to the Marianas. In addition, she received the Navy Unit Commendation for her services at Guadalcanal in 1942 and 1943. =Postscript= As of 2012, no other ship has been named USS Zane. Herman Wouk, author of the novel The Caine Mutiny, served as an officer aboard Zane from February 1943 to February 1945 before becoming executive officer of another Clemson class DMS, USS Southard in May. Zane and her campaigns served as the model for a few of the incidents that took place on the fictional USS Caine (DMS-22), although the climax of the novel is influenced by his experiences as Executive Officer on the Destroyer/Minesweeper USS Southard after she ran aground at the Battle of Okinowa due to a typhoon, two months after peace was declared with Japan. Wouk began writing his first novel, Aurora Dawn, while the Zane was at Tulagi.

In this context, the phrase was coined by Willy Brandt, and it was used by the government of West Berlin, and later popularized in the English-speaking world and elsewhere from the beginning of the 1960s. Inspired by its usage in reference to the Berlin Wall, the term has later been used more widely. For example, the term \\"Wall of Shame\\" can be applied to things, including physical barriers (walls, fences, etc.) serving dishonourable or disputed separation purposes (like the Berlin Wall and the American border wall), physical and virtual bulletin boards listing names or images for purposes of shaming, and even lists in print (i.e., walls of text naming people, companies, etc. for the purpose of shaming them, or as record of embarrassment). Additionally, \\"Wall of Shame\\" may be a significant part in the building of a \\"Hall of Shame\\", although, more often, a \\"Wall of Shame\\" is a monument in its own right (i.e., a wall not having been erected as part of any \\"Hall of Shame\\" endeavour). More recently, the term \\"Wall of Shame\\" has been used in reference to the Mexico–United States barrier, the Egypt–Gaza barrierhttp://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/21/world/la-fg-egypt- wall21-2009dec21 and the Israeli West Bank barrier. Applied to Japanese culture The earliest use of the term, which is a translation of a Japanese phrase, may have been by Ruth Benedict, in her influential book, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1948), and other anthropologists discussing the honor shame culture of Japan. Applied to the Berlin Wall Willy Brandt coined the term Wall of Shame in reference to the Berlin Wall The term was used by the government of West Berlin to refer to the Berlin Wall, which surrounded West Berlin and separated it from East Berlin and the GDR. In 1961, the government of East Germany named the erected wall as the \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Wall\\", a part of the inner German border; many Berliners, however, called it \\"Schandmauer\\" (\\"Wall of Shame\\"). The term was coined by governing mayor Willy Brandt.Julia Sonnevend (2016): Stories Without Borders: The Berlin Wall and the Making of a Global Iconic Event, p. 47, Oxford University Press, Outside Germany it first appeared as \\"Wall of Shame\\" in a cover story published by TIME in 1962, and President of the United States John F. Kennedy used the term in his Annual Message to the US Congress on the State of the Union, 14 January 1963. Often, graffiti would be painted on points, where a street would intersect with the wall, often reading, \\"Road blocked by Wall of Shame\\". The Berlin Wall was referred to as the \\"Wall of Shame\\" in many more recent notable contexts, such as: * The academic article, \\"The Democratic Invention\\", by Mário Soares, former Prime Minister and later President of Portugal (1986–1996)Journal of Democracy 10.2 (1999) 105-112 * The \\"Our Europe\\" speech by Jacques Chirac, President of France, to the Bundestag, 27 June 2000 * A speech in 2002 by Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of Italy and former President of the European Commission Other uses * In 1998, UNIFEM organized a photo exhibit at the United Nations that contrasted a \\"wall of shame\\", focusing on women's plight and suffering, with a \\"wall of hope\\", showcasing initiatives to end violence against women. * An academic paper by M.

The gang was a favourite of the media at the time because of their sensational actions, which included bank robberies, jail breaks, relationships with beautiful women, gun fights, manhunts, and daring captures. Formation Edwin Boyd had committed a variety of crimes in his youth and served time in Saskatchewan's Prince Albert Penitentiary at the age of 22.Toronto's Infamous \\"Boyd Gang\\", CBC Archives After returning from service in the Second World War, Boyd robbed a Toronto branch of the Bank of Montreal with a German Luger on September 9, 1949, while drunk and escaped with With others, he committed six more robberies before he was caught and imprisoned in the Don Jail. There he met Willie Jackson and Lenny Jackson (not related) and together they broke out of jail with a hacksaw concealed in Lenny's artificial leg. After their escape, they were joined by Valent Lesso (a.k.a. Steve Suchan) and committed four more robberies in four months for . Although Lenny Jackson, a hairdresser from Niagara Falls, led the group, Boyd's charms and good looks led the media to label them the \\"Boyd Gang\\". Death of a policeman On March 6, 1952, Detective Sergeant Edmund Tong and his partner, Sergeant Roy Perry stopped a vehicle containing two men; these two men turned out to be Lennie Jackson and Steve Suchan. As Tong approached the vehicle, Suchan drew a .455 pistol and shot him and Sergeant Perry in the police car, wounding the latter in the arm. Tong died of his wounds on March 23, 1952. Both Jacksons and Suchan were arrested in Montreal after a shootout with police that left Lennie and Steve wounded. Both men were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging for the murder of the policeman. Boyd was arrested separately, in Toronto. Second escape All four men were placed in side-by-side cells in the Don Jail. On Sept. 8, 1952, they managed to escape for a second time with the help of another saw blade smuggled in by a lawyer. That night, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's first television newscast, anchored by Lorne Greene and produced by Harry Rasky, detailed the escape. The jail's warden was suspended, and a $26,000 reward was offered for information leading to their arrest. Recapture Ten days later, they were discovered hiding in a barn about a mile north of Sheppard Avenue and Leslie Street after Willie Jackson went to Yonge Street and Sheppard in North York to buy food and cigarettes. Lennie Jackson and Steve Suchan were quickly tried for murder. Although they were defended by prominent lawyers Arthur Maloney and John Josiah Robinette (respectively), both men were found guilty and sentenced to death. While Jackson had not fired a shot at Tong, he essentially confessed on the stand, which undoubtedly hurt their case. They were executed in a double hanging at the Don Jail in December 1952. Edwin Boyd, who had not been present at the murder, was defended by Frederick McMahon, and sentenced to eight life terms plus twenty-seven years concurrently. Willie Jackson was sentenced to thirty-one years. Both served their terms in Kingston Penitentiary. Jackson was released on parole in 1966. Boyd was released earlier, in 1962, but returned to prison for four more years after parole violations. He then moved to the west coast of Canada where he changed his name and remarried. He died in 2002. Unsolved murder Journalist Brian Vallée, who interviewed an ageing Edwin Boyd for Edwin Alonzo Boyd, has alleged that Boyd was also responsible for the unsolved 1947 murder of George Vigus and Iris Scott in Toronto's High Park. Popular culture The 2011 film Citizen Gangster depicts the life of Edwin and the gang. It premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and its theatrical release was in May 2012. The movie changes the identity of the detective whose death is described above and materially changes the circumstances of the shooting.

Hoffmann's photographs were a significant part of Hitler's propaganda campaign to present himself and the Nazi Party as a significant mass phenomenon. He received royalties from all uses of Hitler's image, even on postage stamps, which made him a millionaire over the course of Hitler's reign. After the Second World War he was tried and sentenced to four years in prison for war profiteering. He was classified by the Allies' Art Looting Investigators to be a \\"major offender\\" in Nazi art plundering of Jews, as both art dealer and collector and his art collection, which contained many artworks looted from Jews, was ordered confiscated by the Allies. He recovered the art in 1956 by order of the Bavarian State. Life and career After completing his primary school education, Hoffmann trained as a photographer from 1901 to 1903. He found employment in Heidelberg, Frankfurt on the Main, Bad Homburg, Switzerland, France and England until 1909. In 1909 he owned a photographic shop in Munich and started to work as a press photographer. In 1913 he founded the image agency Photobericht Hoffmann. In 1917 Hoffmann was conscripted to the German Army and served as a photo correspondent with the Bavarian Fliegerersatz-Abteilung I in France. In 1919 Hoffmann joined the Bavarian Einwohnerwehren, a right-wing citizens' militia. That year he witnessed the short-lived post-war Bavarian Soviet Republic in Munich and published a collection of photographs he had taken as Ein Jahr Bayrische Revolution im Bilde (\\"One Year of Bavarian Revolution in Pictures\\"). The accompanying text by Emil Herold suggested a connection between the \\"Jewish features\\" shown in the photographs and the subjects' left-wing policies. =Odeonsplatz picture= Hoffmann photograph supposedly showing Hitler celebrating the outbreak of World War I in the Odeonsplatz in Munich. The authenticity of the photograph is disputed. A noted photograph taken by Hoffmann in Munich's Odeonsplatz on 2 August 1914 apparently shows a young Hitler among the crowd cheering the outbreak of World War I. This was later used in Nazi propaganda, although its authenticity has been questioned. Hoffmann claimed that he only discovered Hitler in the photograph in 1929, after the Nazi leader had visited the photographer's studio. Learning that Hoffmann had photographed the crowd in the Odeonsplatz, Hitler told Hoffmann that he had been there, and Hoffmann said he then searched the glass negative of the image until he found Hitler. The photograph was then published in the 12 March 1932 issue of the Illustrierter Beobachter (\\"Illustrated Observer\\"), a Nazi newspaper. After the war, the glass negative was not found.\\"Famous Hitler rally picture probably faked\\" The Local (14 October 2010) In 2010 historian Gerd Krumeich, a noted German expert on the First World War, came to the conclusion that Hoffmann had doctored the image. Krumeich examined other images of the rally and was unable to find Hitler in the place where Hoffmann's photograph placed him. Also, in a different version of Hoffmann's photo in the Bavarian State Archive, Hitler looks different than in the published image. As a result of the doubt raised by these considerations, the curators of a 2010 Berlin exhibition about the Hitler cult inserted a notice saying that they could not vouch for the image's authenticity.\\"Famous Hitler photograph declared a fake\\" Sydney Morning Herald (20 October 2010) =Nazi Party= Hoffmann met Hitler in 1919 and joined the Nazi Party on 6 April 1920. He participated in the Beer Hall Putsch as a photographic correspondent. While the Nazi Party was banned in 1923, Hoffmann joined the ephemeral Großdeutsche Volksgemeinschaft then rejoined the Nazi Party in 1925. The following year he co-founded the Illustrierter Beobachter. In November 1929 he represented the Nazi Party in the district assembly of Upper Bavaria and from December 1929 to December 1933 he served as a city councillor of Munich. In 1940 Hofmann became a member of the Nazi German Reichstag. After Hitler had taken control of the party in 1921, he named Hoffmann his official photographer, a post he held for over a quarter-century. No other photographer but Hoffmann was allowed to take pictures of Hitler,An exception to this was that Hitler gave Wieland Wagner, a son of his favorite composer, Richard Wagner, sole permission to take and exploit photographs of Hitler at the annual Bayreuth Festival, where Wagner's music was showcased, and of which Hitler was a strong supporter. Hitler had an avuncular relationship with Wieland. Spotts (2002), p. 255 and Hoffmann himself was forbidden to take candid shots. Once, at the Berghof, Hitler's mountain retreat, Hoffmann took a picture of Hitler playing with his mistress Eva Braun's terrier. Hitler told Hoffmann that he could not publish the picture, because \\"A statesman does not permit himself to be photographed with a little dog. A German sheepdog is the only dog worthy of a real man.\\"Fest (1970), p. 80 Hitler strictly controlled his public image in all respects, having himself photographed in any new suit before he would wear it in public, according to Hoffmann, and ordering in 1933 that all images of himself wearing lederhosen be withdrawn from circulation. He also expressed his disapproval of Benito Mussolini allowing himself to be photographed in his bathing suit.Fest (1970), p. 475 n23 The attempt by Hoffmann to portray Hitler as the epitome of the German people was difficult because he lacked the racial profile of the Nordic race (i.e. tall and blonde hair), which the Nazi New Order sought to preserve. Hoffmann tried to portray Hitler in the best light by focusing more on his eyes, which many found dreamy and hypnotic. Hoffmann's photographs were a significant part of Hitler's propaganda campaign to present himself and the Nazi Party as a significant mass phenomenon. In 1926, Hoffmann's images of the Party's rally in Weimar in Thuringia - one of the few German states in which Hitler was not banned from speaking at the time - showed the impressive march-past of 5,000 stormtroopers, saluted by Hitler for the first time with the straight-armed \\"Roman\\" or Fascist salute. These pictures were printed in the main Nazi newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, and distributed by the thousands throughout Germany. That rally was the progenitor of the Party's annual mass rallies which were staged quasi-annually in Nuremberg.Bullock (1962), p. 139 Later, Hoffmann's book, The Hitler Nobody Knows (1933) was an important part of Hitler's strenuous effort to manipulate and control his public image.Rosenbaum 1998, pp. 168–70 Hitler and Hoffmann became close friends. Historian Alan Bullock succinctly described Hoffmann as an \\"earthy Bavarian with a weakness for drinking parties and hearty jokes\\"Bullock (1992), p. 83 who \\"enjoyed the licence of a court jester\\" with Hitler.Bullock (1962), p. 81 Hoffmann was part of the small party which drove to Landsberg Prison to get Hitler when he was released from prison on parole on 20 December 1924, and took his picture.Bullock (1962), p. 127 Later, Hoffmann often dined with Hitler at the Berghof or at the Führer's favorite restaurant in Munich, the Osteria Bavaria, gossiping with him and sharing stories about the painters from Schwabing that Hoffmann knew.Spotts (2002) pp. 82, 92 He accompanied Hitler on his unprecedented election campaign by air during the presidential election against Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg in 1932.Fest (1975), p. 320 In the autumn of 1929, Hoffmann and his second wife Erna introduced his Munich studio assistant, Eva Braun, to Hitler. According to Hoffmann, Hitler thought she was \\"an attractive little thing\\" - Hitler preferred women to be seen and not heard - but Braun actively pursued him, telling her friends that Hitler was in love with her and claiming she would get him to marry her. Hoffmann reports, however, that even though Braun eventually became a resident of the Berghof - after the death of Geli Raubal (see below) - and was then constantly at Hitler's side during the times he was with his private entourage, she was not immediately his mistress; he believes that did happen at some point, even though Hitler's outward attitude to her never changed. Ultimately, to the surprise of his intimate circle,Bullock (1962), pp. 394–95, citing Hoffmann, Heinrich. (1955) Hitler Was My Friend Burke, London. pp. 162–63 Hitler married Braun in the Führerbunker in Berlin on 29 April 1945, and the couple committed suicide together, the following day. On 17 September 1931, Hitler was with Hoffmann on a trip from Munich to Hamburg when the Fǖhrer got word that his niece, Geli Raubal - whom he adored and who accompanied him to almost all social events - had committed suicide by shooting herself. In his post-war memoir, Hitler Was My Friend, Hoffmann expressed the opinion that Raubal killed herself because she was in love with someone other than Hitler, and could not take Hitler's rabidly jealous control of her life, especially after he found out that she had had an affair with Emil Maurice, Hitler's old comrade and chauffeur.Bullock (1962), pp. 393–4, citing Hoffmann, Heinrich. (1955) Hitler Was My Friend Burke, London. pp. 148–49 =Serving Hitler's regime= When Hitler became the ruler of Germany, Hoffmann was the only person authorized to take official photographs of him. Hoffmann's photographs were published as postage stamps, postcards, posters and picture books. Following Hoffmann's suggestion, both he and Hitler received royalties from all uses of Hitler's image, even on postage stamps, which made both Hitler and Hoffmann millionaires: the postage-stamp royalty amounted to at least $75 million over the course of Hitler's reign.Spotts (2002), p. 81 For other subjects, he was represented by Schostal Photo Agency (Agentur Schostal).Rebecca Madamba (2008) The Schostal Agency: A Finding Aid for the Schostal Agency Collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario.

In 1933 Hoffmann was elected to the Reichstag, which after the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933 had become a powerless entity with little function except to serve as a stage setting for some of Hitler's policy speeches.Bullock (1992) p. 317 As a one-party state, an \\"election\\" in Nazi Germany meant marking a ballot approving the Führer's list of candidates; no alternative choices were presented or allowed. Hitler with his staff at his \\"Wolf's Lair\\" field headquarters in May or June 1940. Heinrich Hoffmann is in the front row on the far right The personal esteem Hitler held for Hoffmann is indicated by the fact that in 1935 he allowed the photographer to issue a limited edition of a portfolio of seven paintings Hitler had made during World War I, even though since becoming Chancellor he had downplayed his desire to become a painter in his youth. In later years, Hitler forbade any publication of or commentary about his work as a painter.Spotts (2002), p. 140 Also in 1935, for Hoffmann's 50th birthday, Hitler gave the photographer one of his own paintings of the courtyard of the Alte Residenz (\\"Old Royal Palace\\") in Munich, a favorite subject of Hitler's, and one he had painted many times when he was a struggling artist.Spotts (2002), p. 131 Hoffmann came to own at least four of Hitler's watercolors - one was purchased in 1944, which provoked the remark from Hitler that it would have been \\"insane\\" to have paid more than 150 or 200 marks for it, at mostAbout $106–$141 in 2015 dollars; Spotts (2002), p. 143 and CPI Inflation Calculator United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics - which were seized by the U.S. Army at the end of the war,Spotts (2002), p. 133 and were never returned to Germany.Spotts (2002), p. 180 footnote In 1937, when the selection jury Hitler had chosen to put together the first Great German Art Exhibition to inaugurate the opening of the House of German Art in Munich outraged and angered the Führer with their choices, he dismissed the panel and put Hoffmann in charge. This dismayed the artistic community, who felt that Hoffmann was unqualified for the role. Frederic Spotts, in Hitler and the Aesthetics of Power, reports that Hoffmann was \\"an alcoholic and cretin who knew little more about painting than did the average plumber\\". Hoffmann's answer to his critics was that he knew what Hitler wanted and what would appeal to him. Nevertheless, even some of Hoffmann's choices were dismissed from the exhibition by Hitler; a room full of somewhat more modern paintings which Hoffmann had selected as possibilities were angrily dismissed by Hitler with a gesture. Hoffmann remained in charge for subsequent annual Great German Art Exhibitions, making the preliminary selections which were then hung for Hitler to approve or veto.Spotts (2002), pp. 169–173Bullock (1962), p. 386 Hoffmann preferred the conventional work of painters from southern Germany, what Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels called in his diary \\"Munich-school kitsch\\", over that of the more experimental painters from the north.Spotts (2002), p. 177 In May 1938, when Hitler decreed the \\"Law for the Confiscation of the Products of Degenerate Art\\" - which retroactively justified the Nazis' confiscation without payment of modern art from museums and galleries for the exhibition of \\"Degenerate Art\\" mounted in Munich in July 1937, and allowed for the further unpaid taking of such art from institutions and individuals - Hoffmann was one of the commissioners named to centralize the condemnation and confiscation process, along with chairman Adolf Ziegler, President of the Reich Chamber for Visual Arts, art deal Karl Haberstock, and others. A year later, Josef Goebbels, the Reich Propaganda Minister, brought the commission into his Ministry and restaffed it to include more art dealers, since the sale of these confiscated works internationally was a source of hard currency for the Nazi regime - although not as much as was expected, since the knowledge that the Nazis were putting large numbers of these artworks up for sale depressed their market value. When auctions were halted as war approached, there were still over 12,000 works which the commission Hoffmann sat on had condemned as artistically worthless stored in warehouses. Hitler personally inspected these, and refused to allow them to be returned to the collections they had been confiscated from. The result was the burning in the courtyard of Berlin's central fire station of 1,004 oil paintings and 3,825 other works on 20 March 1939. Along with sculptor Arno Breker, stage designer Benno von Arent, architect Gerdy Troost, and museum director Hans Posse, Hoffmann was one of the few people whose artistic judgment Hitler trusted.Spotts (2002), p. 155 He bestowed the honorific title of \\"Professor\\" on Hoffmann in 1938, something he did for many of his favorites in the arts, such as Leni Riefenstahl, the actress and film director; architects Albert Speer and Hermann Giesler; sculptors Breker and Josef Thorak; Wilhelm Furtwängler, conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic; and actor Emil Jannings; among others.Spotts (2002), p. 79 Hoffmann accompanied Hitler on his state visit to Italy in 1938, in which the Führer was much taken by the beauty of the Italian cities of Rome, Naples and Florence and the artworks and architecture they contained.Spotts (2002), p. 118 Hoffmann (with von Ribbentrop's photographer Helmut Laux) were in the party that went to the Soviet Union when Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop secretly negotiated the Non-Aggression Treaty with Vyacheslav Molotov in 1939, which enabled Hitler to invade Poland. Hitler specifically asked Hoffmann to take a close-up photograph of Stalin's earlobes, by which he thought he could determine if the Soviet leader was Jewish or not. Earlobes that were \\"attached\\" would indicate Jewish blood, while those that were \\"separate\\" would be Aryan; Hoffmann took the requisite image, and Hitler determined to his own satisfaction that Stalin was not Jewish.Bullock (1992), p. 610 Hitler would not allow Hoffmann to publish photographs of Stalin if he was smoking a cigarette, deeming it inappropriate for a leader of Stalin's status to be shown in that way.Fest (1975), p. 518 Besides introducing him to Eva Braun, Hoffmann also introduced Hitler to art dealer Maria Almas Dietrich, who used this connection to sell hundreds of paintings to Hitler himself - for the collection of Hitler's planned Führermuseum in his hometown of Linz, Austria - to other high-ranking Nazis, and to various German museums. In 1941, Hoffmann was chief among the many Nazi chieftains who took advantage of the occupation of the Netherlands to buy paintings and other artworks from Dutch dealers, sometimes at inflated prices. This drove the art market up, much to the consternation of Hans Posse, who had been commissioned by Hitler to assemble a collection for the planned museum. Posse appealed to Hitler to put a stop to it, but Hitler refused the request.Spotts (2002), p. 202 Hoffmann was also the person who recommended Dr. Theodor Morell to Hitler for treatment of his eczema. Morell, who was a member of the Nazi Party, became Hitler's personal physician and treated him for numerous complaints with a panoply of drugs, including amphetamines, cocaine, oxycodone, barbiturates, morphine, strychnine, and testosterone, which may have contributed to Hitler's degraded physical condition by the end of the war.Durlacher, Chris (producer and director). Hitler's Hidden Drug Habit Waddell Media Production for Channel 4 in association with National Geographic Channels (2014) After about 1941, Hoffmann began to lose favor with Hitler, primarily because Martin Bormann - Hitler's personal secretary after Rudolf Hess flew to Scotland in a quixotic attempt to broker a peace deal - did not like him, and in large part controlled access to Hitler. Bormann fed Hitler misinformation and innuendo about his rivals for Hitler's attention, such as Hoffmann.Plaut, James S. \\"Hitler's Capital\\" The Atlantic (October 1946) Family Hoffmann married Therese \\"Lelly\\" Baumann, who was very fond of Hitler,Langer, Walter C..

Their daughter Henriette (\\"Henny\\") was born on 3 February 1913 and followed by a son, Heinrich (\\"Heini\\") on 24 October 1916. Henriette married National Hitler Youth Leader Baldur von Schirach, who provided introductions to many of Hoffmann's picture books, in 1932. Therese Hoffmann died a sudden and unexpected death in 1928. Hoffmann remarried shortly afterwards in 1929; his second wife was Erna Gröbke.\\"Hoffmann, Heinrich\\" World War II in Graves Publications During the Third Reich Hoffmann assembled many photo-books on Hitler, such as The Hitler Nobody Knows (1933) - a book that Ron Rosenbaum calls \\"central to Hitler's extremely shrewd, extremely well-controlled effort to manipulate his image ... to turn his notoriously non-Nordic-looking foreignness, his much-remarked-upon strangeness, into assets to his charisma\\" - and Jugend um Hitler (\\"Youth Around Hitler\\") in 1934. In 1938 Hoffmann wrote three books, Hitler in Italy, Hitler befreit Sudetenland (\\"Hitler Liberates Sudetenland\\") and Hitler in seiner Heimat (\\"Hitler in his Homeland\\"). His Mit Hitler im Westen (\\"With Hitler in the West\\") was published in 1940. His final book of this period, Das Antlitz des Führers (\\"The Face of the Führer\\"), was written shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1936 he had effectively seized control of stereographer Otto Schönstein's publishing house, Raumbild-Verlag, which effectively put him in charge of all mass-market stereoscopic (3D) photography in Germany until the end of the Second World War. After the war, Hoffmann published his memoirs in London in 1955 under the title Hitler Was My Friend. Later life Hoffmann figures prominently in the OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit's Reports 1945–46, Detailed Intelligence Report DIR N°1 carries his name. He was arrested by the United States Army on 10 May 1945, and he was later tried and sentenced to four years for war profiteering. The army considered him a \\"major offender\\" and Werner Friedman called him one of the \\"greediest parasites of the Hitler plague.\\" Upon his release from prison on 31 May 1950, he settled in the small village of Epfach in southern Bavaria, where he died seven years later at the age of 72. His widow, Erna, continued to live there together with the former silent-movie star Wera Engels. Photographic archive Adolf Hitler rehearsing poses for his speeches in photos reportedly taken in 1927. A large archive of Hoffmann's photographs was seized by the United States Army during the Allied occupation of Germany. These are now held by the National Archives and Records Administration and comprise an important source of images for scholars of Nazi Germany. These photographs are in the public domain in the US owing to their status as seized Nazi property, otherwise their copyrights would not yet have expired. There is also an archive called the 'Bildarchiv Hoffmann', at the Bavarian State Library (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek) in Munich, Germany. =Secret photos of Hitler= Nine photographs taken by Hoffmann reveal how Adolf Hitler rehearsed poses and hand gestures for his public speeches. He asked Hoffmann to take these shots so he could see what he would look like to his audience, then used them to help shape his performances, which he was constantly refining.Rosenbaum (1998), p. 111 Hitler asked that the photographs be destroyed, a request which Hoffmann did not honor.

Montana moss agate Moss agate is a semi-precious gemstone formed from silicon dioxide. It is a form of chalcedony which includes minerals of a green colour embedded in the stone, forming filaments and other patterns suggestive of moss. The field is a clear or milky-white quartz, and the included minerals are mainly oxides of manganese or iron. It is not a true form of agate, as it lacks agate's defining feature of concentric banding. Moss agate is of the white variety with green inclusions that resemble moss. It occurs in many locations. The colors are formed due to trace amounts of metal present as an impurity, such as chrome or iron. The metals can make different colors depending on their valence (oxidation state). Despite its name, moss agate does not contain organic matter and is usually formed from weathered volcanic rocks. Montana moss agate is found in the alluvial gravels of the Yellowstone River and its tributaries between Sidney and Billings, Montana. It was originally formed in the Yellowstone National Park area of Wyoming as a result of volcanic activity. In Montana moss agate the red color is the result of iron oxide and the black color is the result of manganese oxide.

He wrote over 300 film scripts. Many of his scripts were successful in Germany. Life After graduating in Leipzig, Lichtenfeld moved into the Federal Republic, and there worked as a reporter on several newspapers. In the 1960s he became the television correspondent for Hörzu magazine. At this time he started to write radio plays and books. From 1968 he worked full-time as a screenplay writer. His first television film Deutschlandreise (German Journey) (1970, co-production between NDR and NRK) was awarded with the Grimme-Preis. A little later he began a partnership with the then still unknown director Wolfgang Petersen. Together they developed a series about police detective Finke (Klaus Schwarzkopf) for the TV series Tatort. These achieved ratings of over seventy per cent. The high point of this series was Reifezeugnis (1974) with Nastassja Kinski and Christian Quadflieg, about a relationship between a teacher and a pupil. While Wolfgang Petersen moved to the cinema and today works successfully in Hollywood, Lichtenfeld remained a writer for television. Besides writing further Tatort scripts he wrote for other crime film series such as The Old Fox. Also outside of the crime film genre he wrote numerous books, radio plays, television films and television series. Lichtenfeld's film scripts were always complex, with very precise dialogue, often not without a shot of irony. =The Black Forest Clinic= Lichtenfeld's greatest success was The Black Forest Clinic (Die Schwarzwaldklinik). Lichtenfeld is often called the inventor of The Black Forest Clinic. But the idea to create a series in a hospital in the Black Forest was conceived by producer Wolfgang Rademann, who gave the screenplay writing job to Lichtenfeld. The series, featuring the white-coated Professor Brinkmann, attracted audiences of 25 million. Lichtenfeld wrote all the scripts for The Black Forest Clinic, as well as his own series Der Landarzt, centring on physician Dr. Matthiesen in the fictitious small town of Deekelsen in Schleswig-Holstein. Lichtenfeld wrote all the episodes until 1997. In the early 1990s Lichtfeld was one of the most sought after screenwriters on German television. Among other series he wrote Das Traumschiff, and Hotel Paradies (1990), Unsere Hagenbecks (1991), Immer wieder Sonntag (1993-1995), Vater wider Willen (1995), and several successful television films. Lichtenfeld's final film, Jugendsünde (Youth Sin) appeared in 2000. Selected filmography *' ( Die Deutschlandreise, dir. Sølve Kern, 1970, TV film) *Tatort: (dir.

Biography Born in 1944 in Los Angeles, Hutch was raised in Dallas, Texas. He joined the high school choral group, The Ambassadors, as a teenager. After graduating from [Booker T. Washington High School, 1962], he shortened his surname when he started his music career in 1964 on the Soul City label with the song \\"Love Has Put Me Down\\". After his move to Los Angeles, his music caught the eye of the mentor for pop/soul quintet The 5th Dimension, and Hutch was soon writing, producing, and arranging songs for the group. In 1969, he signed with RCA Records and put out two albums before he was spotted by Motown producer Hal Davis, who wanted lyrics to his musical composition \\"I'll Be There\\", a song he penned for The Jackson 5. The song was recorded by the group the morning after Hutch received the call. Motown CEO Berry Gordy signed Hutch to be a staff writer, arranger, producer, and musician shortly thereafter. Hutch later co-wrote songs that were recorded by the Jackson 5 and their front man Michael Jackson, Smokey Robinson, the Miracles, and Marvin Gaye. In 1973, Hutch started recording albums for Motown, releasing the Fully Exposed album that year. That same year, Hutch recorded and produced the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film, The Mack. Hutch had several R&B; hits during this period, including \\"Brother's Gonna Work It Out\\" and \\"Slick\\". He also recorded the soundtrack for the 1974 film Foxy Brown. He recorded at least six albums for Motown, peaking with 1975's single \\"Love Power\\", which reached number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. He left Motown in 1977 for Norman Whitfield's Whitfield Records. Hutch returned to Motown in 1982, where he scored the disco hit, \\"In and Out\\", that same year and also recorded a couple of songs – \\"The Glow\\" and \\"Inside You\\" – for the 1985 film The Last Dragon.

She was named for Henry Wasmuth. History Wasmuth was laid down on 12 August 1919 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; designated DD-338 on 17 July 1920; launched on 15 September 1920; sponsored by Miss Gertrude E. Bennet, stepdaughter of Lieutenant Colonel R. H. Davis, USMC, an officer on duty at Mare Island; and commissioned on 16 December 1921, Cmdr. W. P. Gaddis in command. Wasmuth was fitted out at Mare Island until 27 February 1922, when she sailed for Richmond, California, to commence her shakedown cruise. Operating off Sausalito and Mare Island, the new destroyer completed her trials on 14 March, putting into her builder's yard on that day for post-shakedown repairs. She sailed for San Francisco, California on 1 May and calibrated her sound signal apparatus at that port until the 4th, when she shifted to San Pedro. Wasmuth then spent the next month operating in connection with battleship torpedo practices, a duty broken on 7 May by dispatch service to San Diego. Returning to that port from San Pedro on 8 June, she commenced preparations for decommissioning soon thereafter. Placed out of commission at San Diego on 26 July 1922, Wasmuth remained in reserve for nearly eight years during the 1920s, when treaty restrictions and cuts in operating funds reduced the Navy's active seagoing forces. Recommissioned on 11 March 1930, Lt. Cmdr. Ingram C. Sowell in command, Wasmuth operated as a destroyer for the next decade, participating in an intensive slate of tactical exercises and maneuvers, varying that routine with upkeep and training. She also operated with the Battle Force's Destroyer Flotilla 2 from the western seaboard into the Caribbean. Only for one brief period, in the autumn of 1934, was Wasmuth not fully active, being then assigned to Rotating Reserve Squadron 10. With the construction of newer, more heavily armed and far-ranging destroyers, the need for the old \\"flush-deckers\\" in their designed destroyer role diminished. While, of course, a great many of those World War I-authorized ships lay in reserve on both coasts, the Navy was expanding as the 1930s had progressed and, in view of ominous developments in Europe and the Far East, was broadening its operational horizons. Aviation-oriented and mine-warfare types of ships - seaplane tenders and fast minesweepers and minelayers - were needed. Accordingly, some of the old \\"flush-deckers\\" were converted to other roles. Wasmuth, a unit of the fleet in Hawaiian waters since the permanent basing of the ships there in April 1940, was among the Clemson-class ships chosen for conversion to high-speed minesweepers of the Chandler-class. Wasmuth, reclassified as DMS-15 on 19 November 1940, underwent the metamorphosis at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. Retaining her full four-gun main battery and an antiaircraft battery of .50-caliber machine guns, as well as depth charge tracks, the ship lost her torpedo capability when minesweeping gear replaced her dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Upon completion of that conversion at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on 5 April 1941, Wasmuth sailed for Palmyra Island and operated there until 19 April, when she set course to return to Pearl Harbor. The high-speed minesweeper subsequently remained in Hawaiian waters until 10 June, when she sailed for the west coast of the United States. Returning to Hawaii in early July, Wasmuth operated out of Pearl Harbor through the autumn of 1941, as tensions increased in the Far East. She operated on local patrol and minesweeping exercises during that time, as the fleet maintained an intensive training schedule. World War II Shortly before 0800 on 7 December 1941, planes from six Japanese aircraft carriers swept down upon the fleet units present at Pearl Harbor, in a surprise attack. Wasmuth (among the ships in port that Sunday) lay at buoys D-7 and D-7S inboard in a nest with three sister ships of Mine Division (MineDiv) 4: , , and , at the mouth of Pearl Harbor's Middle Loch and just off Pearl City. Wasmuth went to general quarters at once and Lt. (jg.) J. R. Grey (in the absence of both the commander and executive officer) assumed command of the ship. Within three minutes, her gunners had all of the .50-caliber Browning machine guns ready for action while the ship prepared to get underway. Inside the nest, however, the high-speed minesweeper could only bring her aftermost machine guns to bear against the approaching planes. Shortly after 0900, about midway through horizontal bomber attacks (carried out by Nakajima B5N bombers), Aichi D3A's (later code-named \\"Vals\\") began glide- and dive-bombing attacks on the ships and shore installations, kicking off the fourth phase of the raid. Those planes, coming from a westerly direction, were targets for the eager gunners in the minesweepers and minelayers moored in Middle Loch. Wasmuth's gunners (who expended 6,000 rounds of .50-caliber ammunition in the action) opened fire whenever the planes came within range. One man, Seaman 1st Class James P. Hannpn, was given credit for shooting down an Aichi that crashed on Waipio Peninsula, near Middle Loch. The ship damaged several other planes as they came by. Lt Cmdr. L. M. LeHardy (Zane's commanding officer and the senior officer present of MineDiv 4) ordered the ships to get underway, Trever leading the pack at 0932. Five minutes later, Lt. J. W. Leverton, Wasmuth's executive officer, arrived as his ship edged out of Middle Loch, and took command, relieving Lt. (jg.) Grey who had fought the ship since the outset of the attack. Shortly thereafter, Trever's commander reported on board too, since his own ship was steaming down the channel without him. Proceeding out of her harbor herself soon thereafter, Wasmuth took up patrols off the channel entrance. Meanwhile, while the attack itself had ceased, jittery sailors, marines, and soldiers were not so sure. At sea, the forces searching for the retiring Japanese suspected the presence of enemy submarines, real or otherwise. At 1023, Wasmuth dropped one depth charge \\"on suspicious water\\" but came up with only a negative result. At 1036, the high-speed minesweeper dropped another depth charge, but only achieved the same result as the first attack - nothing. Although it brought up \\"large quantities of oil\\" there was no wreckage. Later that afternoon, Wasmuth and Zane swept the Pearl Harbor entrance channel before the former anchored at the coal docks when her sweep wire parted. After she retrieved the sweep gear, she headed back to the open sea, where her commanding officer, Lt. Cmdr. J. L. Wilfong, reported aboard. Trever's commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. D. M. Agnew, rejoined his own ship at 1635. MineDiv 4 soon resumed its patrol operations. Wasmuth operated in the Hawaiian chain between Johnston Island and Pearl Harbor into the spring of 1942. She departed Pearl Harbor on 31 May 1942, and escorted Convoy 4111 to San Francisco, reaching her destination on 10 June. Departing there on the last day of July, Wasmuth returned to Pearl Harbor with Convoy 2113, arriving on 12 August. Departing Pearl Harbor on the 14th, Wasmuth left Hawaii in her wake for the last time, bound for the Aleutian Islands. Reaching Kodiak, Alaska, on 20 August, the high-speed minesweeper spent the remainder of her career in this region as part of Task Force 8, performing screen and escort duties for the supply ships necessary to bear the \\"beans, bullets, and black oil\\" to that theater. In the course of her operations that autumn and winter, the ship visited such picturesquely named places as Women's Bay, Dutch Harbor, Chernofski, Nome, Kodiak, and Point Mush. Fate Two days after Christmas of 1942, Wasmuth was escorting a convoy through a heavy Alaskan storm when two depth charges were wrenched from their tracks by the pounding sea, fell over the side, and exploded beneath the ship's fantail. The blasts carried away part of the ship's stern and the ship began to founder; in the gale, the pumps could not make headway against the inexorably rising water below. Despite the heavy sea, came alongside the foundering Wasmuth. For three and a half hours, the tanker remained with the sinking high-speed minesweeper, battling the waves while successfully transferring her crew and two passengers. After completing that rescue, Ramapo pulled away; Wasmuth eventually sank early on 29 December 1942. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 September 1943. Honors and awards Wasmuth (DMS-15) received one battle star for her part in the defense of the fleet at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

A competitor to the Ford Capri, it was a two-door \\"three-box\\" coupé, and featured distinctive round tail lights, quite similar to those on the Opel GT and which in fact were used on the GT in 1973, its final model year. It took its name, and a few minor styling cues, from the Manta Ray concept car (1961), which also famously influenced the 1968 Chevrolet Corvette C3 (both Chevrolet and Opel had General Motors as their parent company). In the UK market, the first Manta was sold only as an Opel: there was no Vauxhall-branded Manta (or Ascona) until after the launch, in 1975, of the Manta B1 and Ascona B as the Mark 1 Cavalier coupe and sports hatch (Manta) and saloon (Ascona). The Vauxhall and Opel models were subsequently sold side by side. (In the UK the Ford Capri niche was contested, with only limited success, by Vauxhall's Firenza, based on the ageing Vauxhall Viva until 1975.) The sales approach for the Opel line in the U.S. market was equally unusual. The Manta A was one of only a few Opel models sold in the U.S. Opels were imported by GM and sold through Buick dealerships and not their own dealership network, so they were limited in what makes and models they could sell there. Other Opel models sold in the U.S. were Rekord P1 and Rekord P2 (1956–1961), Kadett A (1964–1966), Kadett B (1967–1971), GT (1968–1973), and the Manta / Ascona A (1971–1975). The Ascona A was the saloon version on the Manta A chassis and was sold in the U.S. under the \\"1900\\" name as a two-door and four-door saloon, and as a two-door \\"sport wagon\\". The only difference between the Ascona and Manta was exterior sheet metal, glass and trim. The frame, mechanics, dash, front seats, and many other parts were shared between the cars. The Manta was even sold as the \\"1900 Sport Coupé\\" in 1971 and 1972, rather than as the \\"Manta\\". In 1973, the Manta nameplate was added to U.S.-spec Mantas, but the Asconas kept the 1900 badge throughout their model life. The last year GM imported European-made Opels into the United States under the Opel marque was 1975. In that year the only Opels imported were the Manta and Ascona A. The Manta was normally equipped with a 1.6 or a 1.9-litre CIH engine, although in Europe, a small 1.2-litre motor was also offered. All Mantas sold in the U.S. had the 1.9 L and larger heavy duty radiator (an option on European models). It came with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed TH-180 automatic. The Manta was known to be one of the best-handling cars in its class and went on to win a large number of rallies in Europe and the United States. In the U.S. market, there was a sport model known as the \\"Rallye\\" from 1971 to 1974. The Rallye model was, overall, an appearance and gauge package, the most noticeable difference being the addition of a black hood, and on 1970–1973 models, fog lamps. Mechanically, the only difference was the gear ratios in the models with manual transmissions, and the Rallye model came with standard stiffer suspension, a tighter turning radius, and very aggressive front caster adjustments. Both had dual rear sway bars, providing exceptional handling. In 1973 and 1974 there was also the \\"Luxus\\" model, which included refinements like corduroy seats, colour-coded interiors (blue or burgundy), and faux wood panelling. The only special edition Manta ever produced for the U.S. market was the \\"Blue Max\\", in 1973. This amounted to a blue 1973 Luxus model, with a unique dark blue vinyl roof, mechanical sunroof, and automatic transmission. In 1975, all Manta and 1900 models were equipped with the Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection system in the United States due to emission regulations. Yet in Europe, this feature was only available on the high-end GT/E models, which also sported fog lamps and lower front spoilers, which were not offered on any of the U.S.-spec Manta models. Also of note is that the 1974–75 Manta models had large aluminium bumpers to comply with U.S. crash standards of the time; European Mantas did not receive the large bumpers. With the Deutsche mark becoming stronger, and with other costs also rising, U.S. imports of Opels ended in 1975. Instead, the Isuzu Gemini version of the T-car was imported from Japan and sold by Buick dealers as the \\"Opel by Isuzu\\", and later, \\"Buick Opel\\". The Opel name was last used in the U.S. in 1979. The European market had a number of different versions. Most were basic trim packages, the most popular being the \\"Berlinetta\\", which was similar to the Luxus but included rubber trim on the bumpers (standard on all 1973 U.S. Opel Mantas), vinyl roof, and other miscellaneous features. The one exception was the 1975 Opel, which offered the GT/E and a number of special editions based on the GT/E. The GT/E was a fuel- injected version of the European 1.9L and the performance figures were very impressive for the time. The most notable special editions models based on the GT/E were the \\"Black Magic\\" (with black and plaid interior) and the \\"Swinger\\" edition in white, also with an odd interior choice. =Special Opel Manta A-series cars= There were two different special models made of the Manta A. The primary objective was to increase the power of the car. Both projects started approximately at the same time (around 1972 or 1973). There was the Turbomanta and the TE2800. The Turbomanta is the rarer of the two. Production was a total of 33 cars, with five of them being prototypes and the ones used for public relations. The Turbomanta was actually a 1973 SR with a 1.9-litre \\"S\\" spec engine, originally putting out . The British company Broadspeed was chosen to build the turbo cars, and eventually started building five left-hand drive cars for the German Opel AG. These cars were meant only as prototypes. Broadspeed came up with a somewhat special solution, and used a combination of a Holset 3LDG turbocharger, and a carburettor mounted inside a big plenum chamber. The engine itself was fitted with a thicker copper head gasket, and as such the compression ratio was lowered to 7.6:1. The outcome was a 1.9-litre engine which generated , with acceleration from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 7.6 seconds. All five cars were in GM's \\"signalgelb\\" sunflower yellow, and had large black stripes on the side, where a sign said \\"Turbomanta\\". The downside to this was fuel consumption. The turbocharger had halved the economy of the car, and building it was also costly. Therefore, Opel closed the project, leaving the five cars as the total production number. However a British engineer at the Dealer Opel Team (D.O.T.), which was the British importer and builder of Opel cars in Britain, was so enthusiastic about the cars that he had D.O.T. build an additional 28 cars. The cars were all based on the 1974 luxury Berlinetta model, with full gauge packs, automatic transmissions, and alloy wheels. All 28 cars were black with vinyl roofing. The only thing identifying that the car was indeed a Turbo Manta was a small sign at the rear quarter of the rear wings saying \\"turbo\\". Very few of these cars still remain today. The TE2800 was a totally different project that Opel refused to endorse. A Belgian company called Transeurop Engineering also wanted to increase the engine power of the Manta A. Opel had previously tried a six-cylinder engine layout in 1971 and 1972, but with no success. The cars were deemed too expensive to build, and the market was overwhelmed at the time with big engine cars. But Transeurop Engineering did not agree, and a 2.8-litre CIH-type engine was essentially taken from the Opel Commodore 2.8GS model and fitted into the engine bay of the Manta 1.9SR. The radiator, the bonnet, the entire front end of the car, the rear axle, and the transmission all needed to be changed. To solve this quickly, Transeurop Engineering tried to get Opel to join the project using Opel's earlier experiences with the transformation, but with no success. Even worse for Transeurop, Opel did not even want the Opel brand on the cars if the project ever got off the ground. Transeurop Engineering therefore turned to Opel's best tuner of the time, Steinmetz. They supplied a new fibreglass bonnet with a large bulge on it to make room for the engine, a set of widened arches, and a special front bumper integrated with the lower front spoiler, all to make room for the dramatic changes that needed to be made to the car's front end construction. Much of the front was cut out and replaced with other parts being mounted further to the ground in order to give room for the radiator. A closed radiator system was installed so that the radiator had a water tank in the engine bay (like modern cars). The engine was still the 2.8-litre unit from the Commodore GS and this was originally fitted with two Zenith carburettors. The output was , and with the Commodore four-speed manual gearbox and a 3.18:1 rear axle the car went from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 7.5 seconds. A total of 79 cars were made and sold through Steinmetz in Germany, branded not as Opels but as TE2800s. All Opel badging was removed from the cars and replaced by the \\"TE\\" logo. Steinmetz offered a tune-up for rally and motorsport use. The tuning consisted of porting and flowing the head, a higher compression ratio, a race spec camshaft, and triple carburettors, giving the car up to . Although the TE2800 is the fastest Manta A ever made, it is not officially an Opel. It could outrun cars like the 911 Carrera of 1973 and the BMW 2002 turbo from 1973, even though those cars had more engine power. The low weight of the Manta bodyshell and the combination of the right gear ratios was what gave the car its success. However, the cars were very expensive, almost twice the price of a GT/E in 1975. Very few of these cars exist today, as most were used in rally and motorsport events.

This two-door \\"three-box\\" car was mechanically based directly on the then newly redesigned Opel Ascona, but the overall design was influenced by the 1975 Chevrolet Monza. The Manta had more \\"sporty\\" styling, including a droop-snoot nose not seen on the Ascona, which was similar to the UK equivalent of the Ascona, the Cavalier Mk1. The Vauxhall equivalent of the Manta was the Cavalier Mk1 Sports Hatch and Cavalier Mk1 Coupe. Up until 1981, Vauxhall models were sold in continental Europe alongside Opel in 11 countries, resulting in the Vauxhall Cavalier Mk1 Sports Hatch and Coupe, as well as the saloon equivalent of the Ascona B, competing against each other.Cavalier Mk1 in Continental Europe Engines were available ranging from the small 1.2-litre OHV engine, the 1.6-litre CIH and the 1.9-litre CIH. Also in 1976, the GT/E engine from the Manta A series was adapted into the Manta B programme spawning the GT/E Manta B series. In 1979 the GT/E had the engine replaced with the new 2.0 litre CIH (actually an overhead cam design, but based on the CIH block) and with a new designed Bosch L injection system. Power output was now . The 1.9-litre engine gave way to the 2.0 litre S engine which was aspirated by a Varajet II carburettor. This engine was the most used engine by Opel at the time, and was to be found in several Opel Rekord cars. Opel also offered a dealer-installed tuning kit for the fuel-injected engine, promising at least thanks to a modified camshaft, valve lifters, and exhaust system. In 1977, a three-door hatchback version appeared to complement the existing two-door booted car. This shape was also not unique, being available on the Vauxhall Cavalier Sports Hatch variant. Both Manta versions received a facelift in 1982, which included a plastic front spoiler, sideskirts for the GT/E and GSi models, a small wing at the rear and quadruple air intakes on the grille. Also the 1.2-, 1.6- and 1.9-litre engines were discontinued and replaced by the 1.3-litre OHC engine, the 1.8-litre OHC and the 2.0-litre S and E CIH engines (although the 75 PS 1.9N continued to be available in a few markets). The GT/E was renamed and was called the GSi from 1983 (except in the UK where the GT/E name continued). Production of the Manta continued well after the equivalent Ascona and Cavalier were replaced by a front-wheel-drive model \\"Ascona C\\". The Vauxhall Cavalier Mk1 Sports Hatch and Coupe did not continue past 1981, and there were no coupe versions in the MK2 Cavalier range. In 1982 the 1.8-litre Opel Family II engine from the Ascona C was fitted in the Manta B (replacing the CIH unit) making a more economical Manta B to drive. It could run 14 km per litre and use unleaded fuel. The 1.8 was very popular and was in production for 5 years (1982–1987). The 2.0S models where discontinued in 1984 and only the GSi was available with the \\"large\\" engine (GT/E in the UK). In 1986 Opel released the last Manta B model the Exclusive (1987 in the UK), giving it all of the best in equipment. Recaro seats with red cloth, grey leather like interior and the full bodypack known from the i200 models. This consisted of twin round headlights in a plastic cover, front spoiler and rear lower spoiler from Irmscher, sideskirts and the known 3 split rear spoiler of the Manta 400 (producing of weight on the rear at 200 km/h). In the UK, the Exclusive GT/E models were available in colours such as Dolphin Grey with matching dark grey cloth seats with red piping. These also had the quad headlights, front spoiler but a rear bumper which housed the number plate, coupled with a black plastic strip between the rear light clusters. The rear spoiler was similar to the standard GT/E. Opel finally ceased the production of the Manta B in 1988, only producing the GSi version after 1986 (it was sold as the GT/E in the UK). Its successor, the Calibra - sold as a Vauxhall in Britain, and as an Opel everywhere else - was launched in 1989. General Motors had decided in 1986 to develop a direct replacement for the Manta, despite a dip in popularity for affordable coupes and sports cars (possibly due to the rising popularity of \\"hot hatchbacks\\" like the Volkswagen Golf GTI) which even resulted in Ford deciding not to directly replace the once hugely popular Capri on its demise that year. However, Japanese products like the Honda Prelude and Toyota Celica were enjoying a rise in popularity at this time, while Audi had done well in this sector since launching the Coupe/Quattro in 1980, and Volkswagen had also achieved strong sales of its second generation Scirocco (launched in 1981). Today, these cars are hard to find in an original, good condition; consequently the value has risen considerably over the last few years. It has again become popular, because of its good looks and well-respected handling. =Rally and special versions= In 1979 work began on a rally-spec Opel. Both the Ascona B and the Manta B were used for this. The Ascona 400 model was the more successful of the two, largely due to better weight distribution. Opel joined forces with German tuner Irmscher and Cosworth in Britain, to make the 400. Cosworth was given the task to develop a 16-valve 2-cam head for the CIH spec engine block, and Irmscher who earlier in 1977 and 78 had proven that they knew their way around an Opel building the i2800, was to design the exterior and interior of the cars. The results were not bad. Opel however had problems with the engine. The first idea of using a 2.0-litre engine and then using the 16-valve head from Cosworth simply did not give enough power. The problem was that the heads had already been built, so the heads were made to fit on the CIH type 4-cylinder engine block. So they built an unusual engine using a 2.0-litre engine block and a forged crankshaft with 85mm stroke and ended with a 2.4-litre engine block. Mounting the 16-valve head on this gave a massive output, and the opportunity to make several tune-ups for the rally drivers. Opel delivered the first 23 specimens in 1981 which were recognizable by the 2 slot front grille (1982, 83, and 84 models had 4 slot grilles). The cars were delivered as both street cars and factory tuned rally cars. The streetcars known as Phase 1 cars, were luxury versions of the known Manta B Coupé. Although all the changes to give the body more strength were still implemented, the cars were delivered with all kinds of exclusive packaging. Recaro seats with big Opel badges on the cloth, Irmscher leather steering wheel, and even front light washers were mounted. The cars were all delivered in Arctic White colour, with White Ronal lightweight 7x15\\" alloys. The engine was fitted with a Bosch LE injection system and power output was . The Phase 2 however was quite different. It had large extended arches front and rear made of materials such as carbon and kevlar to keep the weight down, lightweight doors, bonnet, spoilers and windows. The wheels were still from Ronal but now measuring 8x15\\" front and 10x15\\" rear. The engine output was using a set of DCOE style carburettors, and the cars could be delivered with different gearboxes from ZF and with different rear axle options like LSD. Phase 3 which is also a term used when talking about the i400s was not a factory tune-up. Many racers of the time had their garages tune up the engine even further. Some made it across the mark and even today, engines can be tuned to deliver just over still naturally aspirated. The Manta 400 was produced in a total of 245 specimens following the homologation regulations by FISA (today FIA). But the i400 also spawned some other \\"i\\" models: The first was the i200 which basically was a GSi model Manta B with most of the Manta 400's appearance. 700 were made and are still considered a collector's item. The i200 used a tuned 2.0E engine delivering . There was also the i240, which is rarer as only 300 were produced, it is fitted with the i400 engine block but using a normal eight-valve cast-iron head from the 2.0E engine. First presented at the 1985 Geneva Motor Show, it produces and has a claimed top speed of . Also Irmscher themselves tried building the Manta with their own specs. The reason they were used for the 400 project was that in 1977 they had taken a 1977 Manta B 1.9S and put in a 2.8-litre H spec engine from the Opel Admiral of that time. Success was limited, even though the cars were on display at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show. The cars had been painted in some special colours giving it the nickname \\"Paradiesvogel\\" (Bird of Paradise) because of the rainbow like colour theme on the cars. However they did produce 28 specimens with the 2.8H engine delivering and of torque. The cars are considered extremely rare today. After the success of the 400 (and i200/240) Irmscher once again tried the 6-cylinder layout. This time producing the most powerful Manta B ever released on the public market, the Irmscher i300. In 1985, Irmscher bought 29,400 cars from Opel, which were on stock. The cars had no gearbox or engine but were fitted with the Phase 2 equipment. Irmscher installed the new 3.0-litre LE engine from the Monza and Senator models, which delivered and of torque. Power was transmitted to a big Getrag 265 gearbox, onto a 3.18:1 LSD rear axle, giving the car some awesome specifications. 0-60 mph (97 km/h) took 8 seconds flat and the car could reach a top speed of , making it the fastest street Manta ever built. If not for the big 1980s fuel crisis being at its worst at that time, several are sure that Opel would have adapted the idea and built a series of 6-cylinder Mantas. But instead they chose to build the economically more affordable Manta B with a 1.8-litre alloy head OHC style engine in 1985.  Convertible versions  Vauxhall, from 1978 until 1979, offered the Cavalier Coupe in convertible format called the Centaur. Only 118 of these were made and fewer than thirty are believed to survive as of 2007. About a quarter of these conversions were built using a Manta, rather than Vauxhall basis. The cars were developed by Magraw Engineering and sold through Vauxhall dealerships on behalf of Crayford Engineering.

As Nevada prepared for statehood in 1864, its Constitutional Convention began to formalize the features of the state's official seal. Nevada was admitted as a state on October 31, 1864 by proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln. On February 24, 1866, the motto \\"Volens et Potens\\" (\\"Willing and Able\\") was replaced by \\"All for Our Country\\". The design of the seal was formalized, and Nevada's mineral resources are featured with a silver miner and his team moving a carload of ore from a mountain in the foreground. A quartz mill stands before another mountain. Transportation and communication are symbolized by a train steaming across the background, with telegraph poles spanning the distance. Agriculture is represented by a sheaf of wheat, a sickle, and a plow in the foreground. Nevada's natural environment is symbolized by a brilliant sun rising over snow-capped peaks. The inner circle of the seal carries the motto \\"All for Our Country\\", and Nevada's entry into the Union as the 36th state is shown with 36 stars completing the inner ring.

It is to the east of Farnborough (in Hampshire), the nearest town. Much of the village dates from the first half of the twentieth century. Mytchett had a population of 4,624 in the 2011 Census. The nearest railway stations are Farnborough North on the North Downs Line and Farnborough (Main) on the South Western main line. Geography The settlement commences at the foot of the heath known as the upper Bagshot Formation where it forms sandy and occasionally peat bog or marsh depressions, ridges and plains. The heath gives rise to the name of the wider borough and sprouts patches of gorse, heather, pines and silver birches; it has been officially recognised as Pirbright and Ash Commons, part of a Special Area of Conservation which spills over in the north into Chobham Common and in the south to Thursley Common, totalling . Mytchett forms an eastern flank of the Farnborough/Aldershot Built-up Area, a conurbation straddling a small part of the two counties mentioned (Surrey and Hampshire) and Berkshire. The village including small parks, sports grounds and schools spans more than north to south. It is bounded to the north by the South Western Main Line, to the east by the Basingstoke Canal and west by the River Blackwater—its maximum width is . The crossroads has been the location of a main community centre since the late 1980s hosting clubs in sports and leisure. It has indoor sports facilities and accommodates two full-size football pitches and other training pitches.http://themytchettcentre.co.uk/ Within visibility of the centre is the Tamu Nepalese Community Centre to the south founded by the locally numerous British Nepalese community. The village has shops mile north of this point, on a direct road to Frimley Green and Frimley. The nearest Post Office is Frimley Green post office since a complete change to grocery retail in June 2012. ;Demography The population of all usual residents rose from the 2001 to the 2011 census from 4,616 to 4,624. History The area was squarely in the middle of the very long north-south parish of Ash for about a millennium—from at least 1000 AD until 1866 when Mytchett became the south of the new parish of Frimley, itself formerly a chapelry occupying the northern half, or more, of Ash.'The hundred of Woking: Introduction and map', in A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), p. 339. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/surrey/vol3/p339 The Frimley parent area as to vestry administration and people's parish identity covered \\"the western side of Chobham Ridges, and extend[ed] down into the valley of the Blackwater, which bounds the county. The soil is, therefore, Bagshot sand and alluvium, with patches of gravel and large beds of peat. In the latter conifers and rhododendrons flourish exceedingly. The Heatherside Nurseries, where are some of the finest Wellingtonias in England, may be taken as the typical industry of the neighbourhood, which is otherwise a residential district, or occupied by those connected with Aldershot, the Staff College, which is in the parish, and Sandhurst which lies just outside it. A very great part of the parish was open land, heather-covered, before...1801. Much of it is still uncultivated.\\" North of the area the Royal Albert Orphan Asylum was built in 1864. It had in 1911 about two hundred resident boys and girls; a farm was attached to it. A national school was built in 1842 and enlarged in 1897. At the close of the agrarian age, an Inclosure Act (Ash and Frimley) in 1801 made large inclosures of \\"waste\\" (unproductive land with its own somewhat communal legal characteristics), but reserves certain rights of fuel (peat turf) to the inhabitants.'Parishes: Ash ', in A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), pp. 340–344. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/surrey/vol3/pp340-344 The final common fields were inclosed under an Act passed in 1826. A village arose in about the 1900s at Mytchett Crossroads at what was the edge of Michet Farm. The area is shown undeveloped in maps of the late 19th century. Almost wholly residential with associated common public amenities, especially in sports, Mytchett has mainly been built since the 1930s. Pace of building has been relatively gradual; many houses have been substantially altered and extended. =Detention of Rudolf Hess= On 20 May 1941 Rudolf Hess was transported from the Tower of London to Camp Z which was at Mytchett Place. This had been specially set up for his arrival with heavy security and bugging devices. Hess spent 13 months at Camp Z, which was the scene for one of his suicide attempts; he had thrown himself off a balcony on 15 June 1941. The June 1942 move from Mytchett Place was to become notable following the release of MI5 files in 1999. Previously unfounded rumours had claimed that Hess was moved because intelligence reports indicated that a Polish group was planning to break into the Camp Z, kidnap Hess, and beat or kill him by way of revenge for Nazi atrocities in Poland. The MI5 files included a reference to reports of a gun battle between Polish soldiers and guards at Mytchett, although no precise details were given, so the link is not conclusive.Secret Scotland Transport ;Roads and buses Mytchett is close to junctions with an arterial road, the A331 Blackwater Valley Route dual carriageway which connects to the motorway network. Buses are half-hourly to Farnborough, Aldershot in the west, and in the north: Camberley. The bus route with most buses per day is numbered 3, which runs from Yateley via Camberley, Mytchett and Ash to Aldershot twice per hour.Stagecoach bus timetable – Bus 3 – Yateley to ;Trains London rail services (toward the end of a branch line) run from Ash Vale station which is a mean walking distance--it has half-hourly trains direct to London Waterloo.

The Ngäbe mostly live within the Ngäbe-Buglé comarca in the Western Panamanian provinces of Veraguas, Chiriquí and Bocas del Toro. They also have five indigenous territories in southwestern Costa Rica, encompassing 23,600 hectares: Coto Brus, Abrojos Montezuma, Conte Burica, Altos de San Antonio and Guaymi de Osa.Hugh Govan and Rigoberto Carrera (2010) \\"Strengthening Indigenous Cultural Heritage through Capacity Building in Costa Rica\\", In Biocultural Diversity Conservation, eds. Luisa Maffi and Ellen Woodley. Earthsacan. In the early 21st century, there are approximately 200,000-250,000 speakers of the Ngäbere language. Guaymí is an outdated name, derived by the Spanish colonists from the Buglere term for this people (guaymiri). Local newspapers and other media often alternatively spell the name Ngäbe as Ngobe or Ngöbe because Spanish does not contain the sound represented by ä, a low-back rounded a, slightly higher than the English aw in the word saw. Spanish speakers hear ä as either an o or an a. Ngäbe means \\"people\\" in their native language of Ngäbere. Numerous Ngäbe have migrated to Costa Rica in search of work on the coffee fincas. Ngäbere and Buglere are distinct languages in the Chibchan language family. History Ngäbe territory originally extended from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea, though there was never an empire or a distinctive “Ngäbe territory”. Most Ngäbe lived in dispersed villages, which were run by chiefs and influential families. Few, if any, Ngäbe occupied the mountainous region in which they now live.Ngawbe: Tradition and change among the Western Guaymí of Panama. Young, Philip D. University of Illinois Press. Urbana. 1971. Pages 38-42. They retreated to that area under pressure from Spanish colonists and development of low-lying areas. Christopher Columbus and his men contacted the Ngäbe in 1502, in what is now known as the Bocas del Toro province in northwestern Panama. He was repelled by a Ngäbe leader with either the name or title of Quibían. Since that contact, Spanish conquistadors, Latino cattle ranchers, and the development of large banana plantations successively forced the Ngäbe into the less desirable mountainous regions in the west. Many Ngäbe were never defeated in battle, including the famous cacique Urracá who in the 16th century united nearby communities in a more than seven-year struggle against the Conquistadors. Those Ngäbe who survived on the outskirts of this region began to slowly intermarry with the Latinos and became part of what are now termed campesinos, or rural Panamanians with indigenous roots. In the early 1970s the Torrijos administration tried to encourage the Ngäbe to form more compact communities by building roads, schools, clinics, and other infrastructure in designated points in what is now the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé. This marked a social change in lifestyle, as formerly dispersed villages and family units did converge and form larger communities. In 1997, after years of struggle with the Panamanian government, the Ngäbe were granted a Comarca, or semi-autonomous area. The majority now live within its boundaries. The Spanish found three distinct Guaymi tribes in what is today's western Panama; each was named after its chief and each spoke a different language. The chiefs were Natá, in Coclé Province; Parita in the Azuero Peninsula; and the greatest chief Urracá, in what is now Veraguas Province. Guaymi Indian painting Urracá became famous by defeating the Spaniards time after time. He forced Diego de Albitez, a captain of the Spanish, to sign a peace treaty in 1522. He was betrayed and sent in chains to the town of Nombre de Dios on the Atlantic coast. According to historian Bartolomé de las Casas, Urracá escaped and made his way back to the mountains, vowing to fight the Spaniards unto death. He fulfilled his vow. Urracá was so feared by the Spaniards that they avoided combat with his forces. When Urracá died in 1531, he was still a free man. The Ngäbe lived in two large groups: those of the lowlands along the Atlantic coast, and those of the tropical forest in the highlands of Veraguas and Chiriquí Province. They never surrendered and fought until the collapse of the Spanish Empire in the nineteenth century. When Panama broke away from Spain and joined Colombia in the early 19th century, the Ngäbe remained in the mountains. In the 21st century, some are slowly assimilating into modern society. Government The Ngäbe traditionally organized in millions of farms or otherwise lived nomadically in family units. The chiefdoms were run by a chief, who often had an assistant, or cabra, and a council of advisers. In 2012, the Ngäbe adopted a system intended to integrate their traditional government with the modern Panamanian system. As such, the Ngäbe have Official Administrative Authorities and Traditional Authorities. The Administrative Authorities include: a governor and vice governor, mayors for each of the seven districts, and representatives of each county within the districts. These are elected by the people. (Or appointed by national government?) The Traditional Authorities include a congress, which is led by a general congressional president and three regional congressional presidents. The congress works in conjunction with a general Chief, three Regional Chiefs (regional level), and seven Local Chiefs (district level). The Chief acts mostly as a voice of the people but can hold considerable and influential power in that capacity. *The Three Regions: Ñö Kribo, Kädriri, Nedrini *The Seven Districts: Besiko, Jirondai, Kankintu, Kusapín, Mirono, Münä, Nole Duima, Ñürüm, Santa Catalina o Calovébora (Bledeshia) The land The Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle is approximately 2,500 square miles, encompassing areas of the three westernmost provinces of Panamá: Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veraguas. Altitude varies from about 350 feet above sea level to over 7,000 feet in the central mountains; only about half of this land is arable.Young, Philip D. Ngawbe: Tradition and change among the Western Guaymí of Panama. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1971, pp. 4-5 A few Ngäbe have acquired solar electricity (through an electrification project), as well as cell phone service. Most still live below the poverty level and do not own modern technology. Because of the rugged geography, building roads and new infrastructure to Ngäbe reservations has been expensive and difficult for the government. Some Ngäbe choose to live secluded from modern societies. Economy In the early 21st century, most Ngäbe work as subsistence farmers and agricultural laborers. On the Pacific slopes, the main crops are rice, corn, yucca, otoy, ñame, and several species of beans. Small-scale livestock production of chickens and pigs is maintained. In the higher elevations, such livestock is supplemented by hunting (where permitted). The primary crop for the Ngäbe on the Atlantic slopes is green bananas. In order to survive, many Ngäbe resort to working in the cash economy. They pick coffee, work on large cattle ranches, and on banana plantations to make cash. Also, some Ngäbe sell traditional beaded necklaces on the side of the roads in Panama. The Ngäbe women make many traditional crafts, both for their own use and their families', but also to sell as extra income. These include handmade bags from plant fibers called kra,KRA Video of Kra bag makingKra / chacara bags University of Wisconsin Digital Collections colorful dresses called nagua, and beaded bracelets and necklaces. The men weave hats from plant fibers. Many of the coastal-living Ngäbe men, such as those living on the Bocas del Toro islands or on Punto Valiente, rely on ocean resources to provide for their families. They go spearfishing and lobster diving. They both consume and sell what they catch, depending on their circumstances at the time. =Conflicts= In the province Bocas del Toro, the Changuinola Dam was completed in 2011 as a project for flood control and production of hydroelectric power. The government took over great areas of the Ngöbe reserve, flooding it under waters of the reservoir behind the dam. According to a 2012 documentary by Al Jazeera, Panama: Village of the Damned, no compensation was made to the people whose land was taken. In the territory of the Ngöbe, the Barro Blanco project is planned on the Tabasara River. Many townships along the riverbanks will be flooded, adversely affecting an estimated 5000 Ngöbe farmers. The Barro Blanco project is financed by European banks from Germany (German Investment Corporation, DEG) and the Netherlands (Netherlands Development Finance Company, FMO) and counts toward the gloval carbon offset goals set by nations at the UN. In February 2012 many Ngöbe protested against the new dam; two were killed in the confrontation and more than 100 injured or arrested. Many international environmental organizations have protested against the project, such as the German organization Rainforest Rescue, which wrote a petition, addressed to the DEG. Culture =Life passages= A woman is considered \\"sick\\" (bren) while pregnant, and pregnancy is almost never discussed, even during birth. When the baby is deemed healthy, people consider it safe to acknowledge the pregnancy. Many women have traditionally given birth in their homes, with the help of their mother or a midwife. The government has established some women's clinics in Ngobe territory, seeking to improve women's health. The staff have had to adapt some of their practices to accommodate the women's culture and to encourage traditional midwives to come to the hospital. After a death, the immediate family will stay up all night with the body for several nights, drinking cacao and coffee, eating, and talking. Candles must remain lit all night. On the days leading up to the funeral, neighbors and friends will visit to offer their condolences; they will sit with the family members for part of the night. A deep hole is dug, and a tunnel, or shelf is carved out in the bottom part of the hole. The casket is placed in the tunnel, so that the dirt that fills the hole does not fall on top of the casket. The mound is covered in otoe de lagardo leaves. When chewed, these sting and stain the mouth. They are put on the grave to prevent evil spirits from coming near. The deceased's possessions are placed on top of the grave as grave goods. After the funeral, some families abstain from eating [salt] or sugar for four days in order to purify the body. After four days, each family member eats a spoonful of cooked bananas with salt and sugar to break this fast. Dress Since roughly the 1960s, Ngöbe women have worn full-length, short-sleeve dresses called naguas. They extend from the neck to the ankles. It is widely believed that the dresses were introduced by Catholic missionaries for modesty's sake, as the Ngäbe traditionally wore loincloths and little else. The dresses are usually adorned with geometric patterns at the sleeve and neck lines, the waist, and at the bottom of the skirt. The classic Ngäbe geometric pattern is called dientes, or \\"teeth\\", and is said to represent mountains, animal teeth, the ripples of the river, or dragon scales. Men typically wear collared cotton-and-polyester-blend shirts and polyester trousers. Some men wear farmer's hats made out of pita leaves, but most wear baseball caps adopted from urban residents. For most of the year, both genders wear rubber boots when moving about, due to Panama's heavy rainfall and the lack of infrastructure in the Comarca. Religion Spanish missionaries introduced Roman Catholicism in the early 1600s. Since the late 19th century, Protestant, Mormon and Evangelical missionaries of various types have also worked among the people. While the people are predominately Catholic, some Ngäbe have since adopted various forms of protestant Christian views, including: *Jehovah's Witnesses *Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormonism) *Church of Christ *Cuerpo de Cristo *Methodism *Evangelical *Seventh Day Adventism The British Methodist Church established a mission field among the Guaymi Indians about 1926-27, under the leadership of the Rev. Ephraim S. Alphonse (1896-1995). Born locally on the island of Carenero, in Bocas del Toro Province, he was the son of John Alphonse, from Martinique, and Carlotha Reid, a native of Bluefields, Nicaragua. Both parents were of African descent. Alphonse first worked in the area as an engineer, but became increasingly interested in the Guaymi people. He lived, worked and raised his own family among the Valiente people on the Cusapin Peninsula. Working with them to learn the language, he devised a written form and translated the four Gospels of the New Testament and many hymns into the Guaymi dialect. He created a Guaymi Grammar and developed a dictionary in Guaymi, Spanish and English. These were later printed by the Bible Society. Copies of Alphonse's work are held in the archives of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The government honored him with the Order of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa and a Medal of Belisario de Porras. Methodists established a main church in Cusapin and smaller congregations around the Peninsula. The Methodist Church also established a medical clinic in Cusapin.Ephraim Alphonse, Among Valientes, and Dermott Monahan, Laughing Pioneer: Alphonse of Panama (1945) Members of the Baha'i faith number around 8,000. Some writings of the faith have been translated into the native language. Noncomala is the name of a traditional deity. Balseria The Balseria is a four-day festival and Ngäbe traditional sport. The sport consists of two players, who take turns throwing a four-foot- long balsa stick at their opponent's legs. The objective is to hit the opponent below the knees until he can no longer continue. Opponents meet before the match to decide how many sticks will be thrown by each (10 being few, 40 being a lot, and 20 being average). There is no tournament structure, and matches are initiated by challenge and request. The event is initiated when one town invites to host and challenge another town. A good harvest or a reciprocal obligation to host are typical catalysts. Once a date is selected, the host presents the challenged with a knotted rope—each knot represents a day, and the rope is used as a countdown for the event. In the weeks leading up to balseria, participants in each town blow animal horns and other makeshift trumpets to announce the imminence of the event. On the first day of balseria, the hosts receive the challenged in their town and provide food and drink (generally fermented corn, banana, and palm leaf liquor). The second day consists of much of the same. The unstated goal of both sides is to exhaust the other by festivities before the games on the third day. At dawn on the third day, the best balseros of each town lead a procession to a predetermined location and begin the games by facing one another. The dawn matches are supposed to be the best of the day and may feature up to 60 balsas being thrown. After the inaugural match, the rest of the day is informal. Matches are initiated through challenges. The only rules are that no two balseros from the same town can face one another, and players must hit each other below the knees. The \\"below the knees\\" rule is enforced by spectators and \\"teammates\\" of the players, the implied consequence being a fist fight. On the fourth day, the challenged leave, and the hosts take care of the inebriated and injured, who are unable to leave. Attendees of balseria typically dress in traditional Ngäbe clothing and colors. They wear feathers, animal skins, and even entire animals on their backs. Some men also wear the woman's traditional dress, or nagua, to hide their legs during the match. Horns, whistles, and improvised trumpets are widely used. Outside of the Comarca, balseria has a negative reputation in Panama; it is officially outlawed by the government. The general attitude is that balseria is a drunken, violent mess. According to the Ngäbe, while alcohol and violence are present during balseria, it is primarily a cultural event, a unique sport, and a chance to demonstrate pride in their heritage. Mama Tada Mama Tada is a Ngäbe religion (some argue a cult), dating from September 1961. The Virgin Mary (and possibly Jesus – there are several stories) appeared before a Ngäbe woman named Besikö (pronounced \\"bessy-go\\") over the Fonseca River. She was given several messages and commands for her people. While the exact commands of the vision have been hotly disputed, they roughly consist of: * Disengagement from Latino society, including schooling, merchant activities, and general contact * Abolition of fences and therefore the end of property disputes * Abolition of alcohol and the balseria festival * Treatment of all fellow Ngäbe as \\"brothers and sisters\\" * Abolition of fighting and killing over land, wife-beating, and maltreatment of children * Saturday, the day of the vision, is a day for rest and prayer * All Ngäbe should behave like good ChristiansYoung, Philip D. Ngawbe: Tradition and change among the Western Guaymí of Panama. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1971, pp. 212 - 217 Besikö, thereafter more commonly known as Mama Chi, was also told that her people's failure to adhere to these principles within five years would result in the death of all Ngäbe. Mama Chi's preaching affected a great many Ngäbe, who adopted the principles to varying degrees of strictness. Not all complied within five years and the apocalyptic prediction proved false. These original orders have been combined with Christian principles. Mama Tada is now considered more of a xenophobic, folk-style Christianity. Practitioners are noted as wary and resentful of Latinos, and do not drink or practice balseria. The Ngabe who practiced Mama Tada created a stronger sense of brotherhood. This religion is believed to have contributed to the Ngäbe's unified effort to earn their own autonomous area. Socioeconomic status Among all the provinces in Panama, the Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle consistently score lowest in terms of human development, education, income, and social and economic investment indices. They are also most recently second lowest in life expectancy and employment rate. Some facts: * 60.5% of Ngäbes ten years older or above are literate and attend an average of 4.1 years of school * 91.2% of Ngäbes are unemployed * Ngäbe life expectancy is 67.9 years * Ngäbe average annual income is $429 * 91.7% of the population lives in extreme poverty (that is, they make less than $2 a day)Camara de Comercio, Industrias y Agricultura de Panama.

John O'Brien was born in Shropshire in 1922. He was educated at St. Peter's College in Birmingham before beginning work as a publicity copywriter and served for five years in the REME during the Second World War. After the war, he spent some time in industry before returning to Shropshire where he ran his own horticultural business.Spearhead, February 1971 A fruit farmer by trade, O'Brien had initially been a member of the Conservative Party in Shrewsbury. A supporter of Enoch Powell, he attempted to organise a 'Powell for Premier' movement following the Rivers of Blood speech.S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 21. When this failed to get off the ground he briefly joined the National Democratic Party before emerging as a member of the National Front. O'Brien gained a reputation for working towards unity on the far right, establishing contacts not only with the NDP, but also the Monday Club, the Union Movement, the Integralists led by white Russian George Knuppfer and a number of local anti-immigration groups, with the NF ultimately absorbing a number of such groups.M. Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, pp. 99-101. Following internal wranglings within the party, O'Brien was appointed leader of the NF in 1970, following the resignation and removal of A. K. Chesterton (who had brought O'Brien in to be NF Office Manager). Initially seen as a compromise candidate (after the rebellion against Chesterton, no one was willing to take the post), he soon set about trying to modernise the party and clashed with John Tyndall and Martin Webster over the issue, who had backed the O'Brien candidacy because they thought erroneously that he could be easily manipulated. The simmering conflict came to a head when O'Brien accused Webster of working with the Northern League, which had been proscribed in the NF. O'Brien moved to expel Webster but failed to get Tyndall's backing leading to open conflict.M. Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, p. 105. During the resulting struggle O'Brien briefly departed from the scene to go on honeymoon and during his absence the pro-Tyndall contingent made moves to expel a number of his supporters.M. Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, p. 106. O'Brien and his supporters, appalled at the extent to which a small neo-Nazi clique around Tyndall had taken over most of the facets of the party, failed to win the struggle and left to join John Davis' National Independence Party as a group. Although the NIP initially looked like it might challenge the NF, Tyndall's party was galvanised by the arrival in Britain of Uganda's Asian population, who had been expelled by Idi Amin.M. Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, p. 133 The opposition to their resettlement in the UK gave the better-known NF a boost and meant that the NIP failed to gain any momentumalthough they famously beat former Tory candidate turned National Front candidate Roy Painter in Tottenham at the February 1974 General Election (despite his campaign enjoying a campaign-diary spot during the election with The Guardian)and struggled on until 1976, when it was closed down. O'Brien did not return to the political arena after this although he contributed to the British nationalist journal Candour. He died suddenly on 21 September 1982 aged 60.Candour, November/December 1982 The former leader of the NF can claim to have made one of the most significant blows against neo- Nazism in post-war Britain. His involvement with the This Week documentary on ITV about the NF (Thames Television, ITV, September 1974where he was also interviewed at length about the party he left whilst its chairman) caused immense damage to the National Front and instigated fury within the party's ordinary membership that they had not been made aware as to the full extent of the neo-Nazi pasts and continuing links of the likes of Tyndall and Martin Webster. Within one month of the broadcast, Tyndall was fired as NF Chairman.S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, pp. 35-6 O'Brien should not be confused with the John O'Brien involved with the White Nationalist Party,Antisemitism and Racism - United Kingdom as the latter long survived him.

The early history of attitudes towards gender in the Religious Society of Friends (aka Quakers) is particularly notable for providing for one of the largest and most equitable roles for women in the Christian tradition at the time, despite not endorsing universal equality until much later. For many outside observers during the first hundred years of Quakerism, the most surprising aspect of Quakerism was that \\"ministry\\" - the prerogative to speak during a Quaker meeting - was open to women from the very beginnings of the movement in the 1650s. One of the earliest to formulate direct biblical justification for this was Sarah Blackborow.E. g. in A Visit to the Spirit in Prison... (London, 1658). In James Boswell's Life of Johnson, Samuel Johnson's opinion of a female Quaker preacher was recorded thus: \\"Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.\\" Especially in the early years, a large number - even possibly the majority - of traveling Quaker preachers were women.The Role a Female Traveling Minister Played in Spreading Quaker Beliefs by Colleen Clark Aside from ministry, Quaker women travelled alone and published their writing, which was also unusual for the time. One of several prolific pamphleteers was Dorothy White. Dorothy White Retrieved 11 January 2018. For many Quakers, both historical and contemporary, the inclusion of women is part of what is now called the \\"Testimony of Equality\\". However, despite that testimony, women's roles were not completely equal for many years. In the beginning, Meetings for Business were dominated by male Friends, but within twenty-five years, George Fox ordered establishment of separate women's meetings when he faced challenges to his leadership. Particularly controversial was his decision that women's meetings for discipline should be the first to pass on a couple's intention to be married. Separate meetings declined by the 19th century and were eliminated later. Having authority over any business at all – let alone authority over men (in the form of approving or denying marriages) – was a radical move in the 17th century, and gave women then-rare experience in running organizations.QUAKER VIEWS - That of God in Everyone Retrieved 11 January 2018. Concerning the introduction and much later dissolution of separate meetings, one historian writes, :\\"On balance, and in the long run, I believe that the separate women's meeting was good for women; indeed, it may be said to have been a cradle not only of modern feminism but of the movements of abolitionism, women's suffrage, and peace activism, all of which were, and are, enlivened by the presence (even predominance) of Quaker female leaders.\\"Mack, Phyllis, Visionary Women: Ecstatic Prophecy in Seventeenth-Century England. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991. Mack's views are given a qualified endorsement by another historian, Ann Hughes, in The Emergence of Quaker Writing (Routledge 1996), saying historians should be skeptical of such \\"spectacular claims\\" but there is \\"more validity in this claim than in most.\\" (page 146) Quakers were heavily involved in the 19th-century movement for women's rights in America; the landmark 1848 Seneca Falls Declaration was in large part the work of Quaker women, and has numerous Quaker signatories, well out of proportion to the number of Quakers in American society at large.Article from National Portrait Gallery .

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention. At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009. A health educator is \\"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p. 100). In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below.

In 1961 she was employed at Ohio State University as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969. Most health education curricula used in schools today are based on ten conceptual areas identified by that study. They focus on community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse. School Health Education Worldwide =Romania= Since 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies. =Japan= Shokuiku (Kanji: 食育) is the Japanese term for \\"food education\\". The law defines it as the \\"acquisition of knowledge about food and nutrition, as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a healthy diet\\". It was initiated by Sagen Ishizuka, a famous military doctor and pioneer of the macrobiotic diet. Following the introduction of Western fast food in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study. Major concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include: * Schoolchildren skipping breakfast. * Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents. * Families not eating meals together. Classes in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.Mark Frank. \\"Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project\\". Bulletin of Keiwa College 15 (2006). = Poland = Health education in Poland is not mandatory, but research has shown that even with implantation of health education that the adolescents of Poland were still not choosing to live a healthy lifestyle. Health education is still needed in Poland, but the factor of what is actually available, especially in rural areas, and what is affordable affects the decisions more than what is healthy. = Taiwan = Health education in Taiwan focuses on multiple topics, including: *Education for student to enhance their health status *Assists parents to use health resources and health education information *Teach students to understand specific diseases and basic medical knowledge See also * Dorothy Nyswander * Health promotion * Online health communities * Personal, Social and Health Education * Physical Education * Public Health * School Health Education Study * Health skills References Books *Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.

She is famous for having given up her life in the defense of her husband, King Maha Chakkraphat, in a battle during the Burmese–Siamese War (1547–1549). Somdet Phra () and Sri (), pronounced and often transcribed Si, are her honorifics. Her given name Suriyothai means \\"dawn\\". It is a compound of Suriya, from Sanskrit surya सूर्य \\"sun\\"; plus Uthai from udaya उदय \\"rising\\", a cognate of Aurora and Ushas.  Life  Suriyothai was married to Prince Tien when he was regent under King Yodfa's rule. Wishing to remain faithful to Suriothai, Prince Tien entered a monastery to avoid the advances of Sudachan, the Queen Mother.Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited Suriyothai was queen during the early part of the reign of King Maha Chakkraphat (2091 to 2106 Buddhist Era, with another reign from 2111 to 2112 B.E.). In 1548 CE, barely six months into King Maha Chakkraphat's reign, the King of Burma invaded Siam with the intent of sacking the main capital, Ayutthaya. =First Burmese invasion = Painting by Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs, depicting Queen Suriyothai (center) on her elephant putting herself between King Maha Chakkraphat (right) and the Viceroy of Prome (left). The invasion initially met little resistance, as the Burmese force was too large for the small guard posts on the border.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 15 Upon hearing of the Burmese invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at Suphanburi, a town just west of Ayutthaya.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 17 When Tabinshwehti and his Burmese army arrived at the walled town of Kanchanaburi, they found it deserted.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18 The King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru and Chorakhe Sam Phan.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18 Tabinshwehti divided his army into three columns, the first commanded by Bayinnaung, the second by the Viceroy of Prome, and the third by Yong, the Governor of Bassein.Phayre p. 101 The Burmese continued their advance and captured the ancient town of Uthong as well as the villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closed on Suphanburi. When the Burmese attacked the town, the Siamese defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the Chao Phraya River near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli Plain.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18 Maha Chakkraphat left the capital with his forces to engage Tabinshwehti and test Burmese strength. On this occasion, he mounted his chief war elephant. Accompanying him were his Chief Queen, Sri Suriyothai, and one of their young daughters, Princess Boromdhilok, the two riding together on a smaller war elephant. Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the uniform of an Uparaja. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the Uparaja and heir apparent, Prince Ramesuan, and his brother Prince Mahin.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18Wood p. 113 = Elephant battle and death= The Siamese army under Maha Chakkraphat soon met the advance column commanded by the Viceroy of Prome, and the two armies engaged in battle. The commanders of the two forces engaged in single elephant-combat, as was the custom of the time.Thaiways, \\"Elephant Duel: The Honorary Combat on Elephant Back\\" Retrieved 6 February 2010 Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy, the viceroy giving chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the king and the viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit.Wood p. 113Damrong Rajanubhab p. 19 The viceroy then engaged the queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also mortally wounding her daughter. Both mother and child met their deaths on the back of the same elephant.Damrong Rajanubhab p. 19Wood p. 112Harvey p. 159 It was said that the viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck. As she fell dying, her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Burmese chronicles do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the Viceroy of Prome.Burmese chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 181–192) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238–248) devote a detailed account of the invasion, down to the names of war elephants the high royalty rode on. Thado Dhamma Yaza rode the war elephant named Ye Htut Mingala (Hmannan Vol. 2 2033: 244). If he was victorious in combat against any enemy of significance, such a story with a favorable outcome would likely have been included in the chronicles. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the viceroy, and drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital.Wood p. 113Damrong Rajanubhab p. 19  Children  *Phra Ramesuan – Upparat, captured and ransomed in 1549, taken as prisoner in 1564, died as a commander of the Burmese army in 1564. *Phra Mahin – later King Mahinthrathirat. *Phra Sawatdirat – became wife of Maha Thammaracha, later Queen Wisutkasat, mother of King Naresuan, King Ekathotsarot and Princess Suphankanlaya. *Phra Boromdilok – died next to her mother in battle. *Phra Thepkassatri – bride-to- be of King Setthathirath of Lan Xang, kidnapped and taken to Burma  Legacy  Queen Suriyothai Monument at Ayutthaya A memorial chedi to Queen Suriyothai, Phra Chedi Sisuriyothai, was built by King Maha Chakkraphat in her honor.

All governmental offices, agencies, and courts in Ohio use variations of the state seal. Its primary feature is a circular coat of arms that depicts a sunrise in Chillicothe, Ohio's first capital, along with symbols of the state's origins. The seal sometimes appears with the state motto, \\"With God, all things are possible\\". Shortly after its establishment in 1803, the state adopted a seal based on a sketch by Secretary of State William Creighton, Jr. Except for a brief period during the 1860s, the layout and details were left largely unregulated until a standardized coat of arms, based on the original design, was introduced in 1967. The coat of arms was modified most recently in 1996. Each of Ohio's 88 counties maintains its own official seal based on the state seal. Design The design of the Great Seal of the State of Ohio is defined in Ohio Revised Code section 5.10: The coat of arms is defined in section 5.04: The hills shown in the seal are managed by the Department of Natural Resources as Great Seal State Park. History Ohio's state seal has been redesigned at least ten times in the state's history. From 1805 to 1866, the seal's design was left unspecified, a situation unique among the states. =Territorial seal= Northwest of the River Ohio Motto: (\\"He has planted one better than the one fallen\\") Before Ohio's statehood, the territorial government of the Northwest Territory had its own seal. The United States Congress passed legislation on May 8, 1792, that directed the U.S. Secretary of State to \\"provide proper seals for the several and respective public offices in the [Northwest] Territories\\". A seal was created by the State Department to be used on official papers of the territory. The original seal was maintained by Governor Arthur St. Clair. Its first recorded use was in a proclamation made on July 26, 1788. The seal bears a Latin inscription, , \\"He has planted one better than the one fallen,\\" commemorating the decline of wilderness to make way for civilization. says the young tree on the seal is an apple tree, while says it is a buckeye and perhaps the genesis of Ohio's nickname. =Rising sun= The first Constitution of Ohio, adopted on November 29, 1802, and effective March 1, 1803, provided for a state seal but left the details unspecified: The first Secretary of State, William Creighton, Jr., initially used his personal seal on official documents. Sugarloaf Mountain and Sand Hill from Adena On March 25, 1803, the General Assembly passed an act concerning the duties of the Secretary of State, introducing the first of many designs for the state seal, based on a sketch by Creighton: The design was traditionally said to depict the view from U.S. Senator Thomas Worthington's Chillicothe-area estate, Belle View: in 1803, Creighton emerged from an all-night meeting at the estate and saw \\"the rising sun of the new state\\" just beyond Mount Logan. Creighton and Worthington both belonged to the \\"Chillicothe Junto\\" that dominated early state politics. However, most historians regard the story to be apocryphal, noting that the sun, mountains, and agricultural implements were common in seals of that era. Regardless, the present seal does represent the view from Worthington's estate, now known as Adena, as a matter of law. The physical seal of 1803 followed the adopted design loosely: from behind a full mountain range rose a sun with eyes. =Deregulation= On February 19, 1805, the 1803 statute was replaced with identical wording, except for the omission of a design for the great seal. The original state seal had long since fallen out of use. Despite the 1805 act being itself repealed on January 31, 1831, no replacement design was specified. Legislators neglected to address the issue even after the Constitution of 1851 left intact the constitutional requirement for a design. In the meantime, a wide array of designs emerged, particularly on court seals. Common embellishments included a plow and recumbent sheath of wheat, a range of mountains instead of a single peak (as in the Creighton seal), and an \\"ark\\" (a broad horn flatboat with a roof) floating on a river (understood to be the Ohio River, quite a distance from Chillicothe). The 1847 seal depicted in the Statehouse rotunda skylight substitutes the Ohio with a canal, replete with a canal boat. In an 1860s version, the arrows levitate among the clouds. Besides artistic liberty, some seals reflected confusion over the state's founding year, which was popularly believed to be 1802, the year the original constitution was adopted. =Fleeting empire= In 1865, Secretary of State William Henry Smith issued a report on the need to reign in the seal's design. Though appreciative of the symbolism behind the 1803 design, he found the state's seal to compare unfavorably to other states' larger, more ornate seals, which also featured mottoes and obverse designs. On April 6, 1866, a Republican General Assembly responded, calling for an elaborate coat of arms: The act increased the size of the great seal to and added mandatory seals for various public officials at the state and county levels. Governor Jacob Dolson Cox issued a proclamation on November 5, 1866, that describes and bears the seal adopted that year. The Republicans' new motto was problematic, as it ironically recalled states' rights just after the Civil War. Moreover, the increased size, intricate design, and additional seals more than exhausted the $1,000 that had been appropriated to the Secretary of State (). An even larger budget overrun would have resulted from an amendment on April 16, 1867. On May 9, 1868, a newly elected Democratic General Assembly reverted to the 1803 coat of arms and formalized the depiction of a mountain range, present since Creighton's seal. The river remained in contemporary depictions. Despite the about-face, the 1866 device persisted in various capacities for decades. To the dismay of one historian, the Governor, Secretary of State, and Supreme Court all continued to seal documents with the 1866 device into the 1880s. The State Printer also published books featuring the old seal and motto into the 1900s. In 1889, stained glass seals of 42 states then in existence, including the 1866 Ohio seal, were hung in the Superior Court of San Diego County, California. =Standardization= A color reproduction of the 1967–1996 seal. On December 15, 1967, the coat of arms received a substantial revision. Cincinnati-based interior decorator Robert Greiwe had been commissioned to paint the Great Seal on the dropped ceiling of the Ohio Statehouse rotunda. His uncertainty over which version to paint led State Representatives Ralph B. Kohnen and Myrl Shoemaker to sponsor 107 HB 164, which standardized a specific design throughout state government.Card catalog entry for Greiwe Interiors Records, 1888–1975 (bulk 1888–1940, 1965–1968), Mss BC 011, Cincinnati Historical Society, Cincinnati Museum Center. . The river was reintroduced to the coat of arms, while seventeen distinct rays of sunlight extended to the perimeter of the coat of arms. Now the scene officially depicted the view from Adena. A reference image was for the first time included in the statute: Under the new legislation, the Governor was given authorization to regulate the seal's use. All new seals acquired after January 1, 1969, were required to bear the new design, and the requirement was extended to county and municipal governments for the first time. Many cities had already adopted seals that bore no relation to the state seal, but they were exempted under a grandfather clause. Though the physical Great Seal was also exempted, the Governor's office eventually replaced it with one that conformed to the new design. The seal with the motto, \\"With God, all things are possible\\", in front of the Ohio Statehouse. The latest modification, on November 20, 1996, reduced the number of rays from 17 to 13, \\"to represent the thirteen original colonies shining over the first state in the northwest territory\\". The reference image was also modified to include a small dot at the interior end of each ray. The bill's sponsor, Senator Roy Ray, argued that the number 17 was already present in the bundle of arrows. State agencies were given a deadline of March 1, 2003 the state bicentennial to update the seal on all publications. There were unsuccessful attempts in 1997, 1999, 2003, and 2011 to add the Wright Flyer to the seal.125 HB 99, 125th General Assembly.123 HB 17, 123rd General Assembly.129 HB 309, 129th General Assembly. Usage The \\"sunburst\\" license plate design featured the upper half of the Ohio coat of arms. Section 5.10 of the Ohio Revised Code requires the seals of all \\"state, county, and municipal agencies, divisions, boards and commissions\\" to bear the state coat of arms. It also specifies the exact wording of the text surrounding the coat of arms of various courts and statewide elected offices. Notaries public are also required to incorporate the state coat of arms in their seals. Various state agencies, such as the Departments of Transportation and Veterans Services, along with many cities, have developed more distinctive emblems and logos to complement their seals. The state coat of arms appears in the center of the flag of the Governor of Ohio. This design was adopted unofficially in 1905 and officially in 1945. Previously, in 1860, state militia officials unsuccessfully proposed a state flag consisting of the seal upon a white field. From 2004 to 2010, the state's official coat of arms served as a backdrop for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles' \\"sunburst\\" license plate design, which was issued over a longer period than any other design since the 1980s. =Variations= File:Seal of the Governor of Ohio.svgSeal of the Governor of Ohio File:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio.svgSeal of the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio File:Seal of the Ohio House of Representatives.svgSeal of the Ohio House of Representatives File:Seal of the Ohio Senate.svgSeal of the Ohio Senate File:Seal of the President of the Ohio Senate.svgSeal of the President of the Ohio Senate File:Seal of the Supreme Court of Ohio.svgSeal of the Supreme Court of Ohio File:Seal of Ohio Secretary of State.svgSeal of the Secretary of State of Ohio File:Seal of the Attorney General of Ohio.svgSeal of the Attorney General of Ohio File:Seal of the State Treasurer of Ohio.svgSeal of Ohio State Treasurer File:Seal of the State Auditor of Ohio.svgSeal of the Ohio State Auditor File:Seal of the Inspector General of Ohio.svgSeal of the Inspector General of Ohio File:Seal of the Ohio Department of Agriculture.svgSeal of the Ohio Department of Agriculture File:Seal of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.svgSeal of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles File:Seal of the Ohio Department of Commerce.svgSeal of the Ohio Department of Commerce File:Seal of the Ohio Department of Taxation.svgSeal of the Ohio Department of Taxation File:Seal of the Ohio Commission on Hispanic and Latino Affairs.svgSeal of the Ohio Commission on Hispanic and Latino Affairs File:OBM-Logo rgb 1000px-1000px.pngSeal of the Ohio Office of Budget and Management File:Seal of the Ohio Elections Commission.svgSeal of the Ohio Elections Commission File:Seal of the Ohio Ethics Commission.svgSeal of the Ohio Ethics Commission File:Seal of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.svgSeal of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission File:Seal of the Ohio Consumers Counsel.svgSeal of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel File:Seal of the Ohio Public Defender.svgSeal of the Ohio Public Defender File:Seal of the Ohio Medical Board.svgSeal of the Ohio Medical Board File:Seal of the County Auditors Association of Ohio.svgSeal of the County Auditors' Association of Ohio File:Seal of the County Treasurers Association of Ohio.svgSeal of the County Treasurers Association of Ohio File:Seal of the City of Hubbard (Ohio).svgSeal of the City of Hubbard File:Seal of the City of Portsmouth (Ohio).svgSeal of the City of Portsmouth File:Seal of Youngstown, Ohio.svgSeal of the City of Youngstown File:Seal of Adams County (Ohio).svgSeal of Adams County File:Seal of Columbiana County (Ohio).svgSeal of Columbiana County File:Seal of Fairfield County (Ohio).svgSeal of Fairfield County File:Seal of Franklin County (Ohio).svgSeal of Franklin County File:Seal of Guernsey County (Ohio).svgSeal of Guernsey County File:Seal of Hamilton County (Ohio).svgSeal of Hamilton County File:Seal of Hancock County (Ohio).svgSeal of Hancock County File:Seal of Highland County (Ohio).svgSeal of Highland County File:Seal of Mahoning County (Ohio).svgSeal of Mahoning County File:Seal of Ross County (Ohio).svgSeal of Ross County File:Seal of Warren County (Ohio).svgSeal of Warren County  See also  *List of Ohio state symbols *Seal of Cincinnati References External links * Section 5.04 of the Ohio Revised Code (Lawriter) – defines the state coat of arms ** Graphical version of §5.04 * Section 5.10 of the Ohio Revised Code (Lawriter) – defines the state seal Ohio Category:Symbols of Ohio Ohio Ohio Ohio Ohio Ohio Category:Symbols introduced in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Seal of Ohio"},{"id":"2459587","text":"Limnoria is a genus of isopods from the family Limnoriidae.

Crowded Coney Island beach scenes, popular entertainments such as vaudeville and burlesque, women, and jobless men on the Bowery are subjects that reappear throughout his work. He painted in egg tempera and in oils, and produced many watercolors, ink and ink wash drawings, and prints.  Biography  = Childhood and education = Reginald Marsh was born in an apartment in Paris above the Café du Dome. He was the second son born to American parents who were both artists. His mother, Alice Randall was a miniaturist painter and his father, Frederick Dana Marsh, was a muralist and one of the earliest American painters to depict modern industry. The family was well off; Marsh's paternal grandfather had made a fortune in the meat packing business. When Marsh was two years old his family moved to Nutley, New Jersey, where his father acquired a studio home located on The Enclosure, a street that had been established as an artists' colony some decades earlier by the American painter Frank Fowler. Marsh later acquired an estate in Woodstock, NY where the family spent most of their summers. Marsh attended the Lawrenceville School and graduated in 1920 from Yale University. At Yale Art School he worked as the star illustrator and cartoonist for campus humor magazine The Yale Record.Marsh, Reginald (October, 1916). \\"On the Straight and Narrow\\". The Yale Record. New Haven: Yale Record. Marsh was noted to have fully enjoyed his time at Yale. He moved to New York after graduation, where his ambition was to find work as a freelance illustrator. In 1922, he was hired to sketch vaudeville and burlesque performers for a regular New York Daily News feature, and when The New Yorker began publication in 1925, Marsh and fellow Yale Record alum Peter Arno were among the magazine's first cartoonists. Although not primarily remembered as a cartoonist, he was a prolific and thoughtful contributor to The New Yorker from 1925 to 1944. He also created illustrations for the New Masses (an American Marxist journal published from the 1920s to the 1940s). = Training and influences = A casual interest in learning to paint led Marsh, in 1921, to begin taking classes at the Art Students League of New York, where his first teacher was John Sloan. By 1923 Marsh began to paint seriously. In this year he also married Betty Burroughs, another student at the college and daughter to artist Bryson Burroughs. The marriage ended in divorce in 1933. In 1925, Marsh visited Paris for the first time since he had lived there as a child and he fell in love with what the city had to offer him. Although Marsh had appreciated the drawings of Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo since he was a child—his father's studio was full of reproductions of the old masters' work—the famous paintings that he saw at the Louvre and other museums stimulated in him a new fascination with those painters. While exploring the works of European painters such as Titian, Tintoretto, and Rubens, Marsh met Thomas Hart Benton in one of the galleries in France. Benton, known today as a social realist, and regionalist painter, was also a great student of the Baroque masters. The resemblance Marsh saw between Tintoretto's famous works and Benton's motivated Marsh to try to paint in a similar way. Following his European trip (in which he also visited Florence) Marsh returned to New York with a desire to utilize the principles he felt were evident in the art of the Renaissance painters—particularly the way large groups of figures, together with architecture or landscape elements, were organized into stable compositions. Marsh then studied under Kenneth Hayes Miller and George Luks, and chose to do fewer commercial assignments. Miller, who taught at the Art Students League of New York, instructed Marsh on the basics of form and design, and encouraged Marsh to make himself known to the world. He looked at Marsh's early, awkward burlesque sketches and at his more conventional landscape watercolors and said, \\"These awkward things are your work. These are real. Stick to these things and don't let anyone dissuade you!\\" By the beginning of the 1930s Marsh began to express himself fully in his art. As late as 1944, Marsh wrote, \\"I still show him every picture I paint. I am a Miller student.\\" Marsh began to work with John Steuart Curry after his training with Miller. Both Marsh and Curry took lessons from Jacques Maroger, whom Marsh met in New York City in 1940. Maroger, who was a former restorer at the Louvre, believed he had discovered the secrets of the old masters and was well known for his advocacy of a painting medium made by cooking white lead in linseed oil. Maroger provided a body of material documenting his work for Marsh and Curry to study, and they adopted his ideas.  Marsh at work  Marsh's etchings were his first work as an artist. In the early 1920s, he also made several linocuts, and later produced lithographs and engravings. He kept careful watch of the technique he used for his prints, noting the temperature of the room, the age of the bath that his plates were soaked in, the composition, and the length of time the plate was etched. When making prints of the etchings Marsh recorded how long the paper soaked for, the heating of the plate, and the nature of the ink used. Marsh enjoyed experimentation with all his artworks and was therefore renowned for his unique techniques. In the early 1920s, he began to work with watercolor and oil. He did not take to oil naturally and decided to stick to watercolor for the next decade. Yet, in 1929 he discovered egg tempera, which he found to be somewhat like watercolor but with more depth and body.  Subjects  Reginald Marsh rejected modern art, which he found sterile. Marsh's style can best be described as social realism. His work depicted the Great Depression and a range of social classes whose division was accentuated by the economic crash. His figures are generally treated as types. \\"What interested Marsh was not the individuals in a crowd, but the crowd itself ... In their density and picturesqueness, they recall the crowds in the movies of Preston Sturges or Frank Capra\\". Marsh's main attractions were the burlesque stage, the hobos on the Bowery, crowds on city streets and at Coney Island, and women. His deep devotion to the old masters led to his creating works of art in a style that reflects certain artistic traditions, and his work often contained religious metaphors. \\"It was upon the Baroque masters that Marsh based his own human comedy\\", inspired by the past but residing in the present. The burlesque queen in the etching Striptease at New Gotham (1935) assumes the classic Venus Pudica pose; elsewhere, \\"Venuses and Adonises walk the Coney Island beach [and] deposed Christs collapse on the Bowery\\". The painting Fourteenth Street (1934, in the Museum of Modern Art, New York) depicts a large crowd in front of a theater hall, in a tumbling arrangement that recalls a Last Judgment. Marsh filled sketchbooks with drawings made on the street, in the subway, or at the beach. Marilyn Cohen calls Marsh's sketchbooks \\"the foundation of his art. They show a passion for contemporary detail and a desire to retain the whole of his experience\\". He drew not only figures but costumes, architecture, and locations. He made drawings of posters and advertising signs, the texts of which were copied out along with descriptions of the colors and use of italics. In the early 1930s he took up photography as another means of note taking. Signage, newspaper headlines, and advertising images are often prominent in Marsh's finished paintings, in which color is used to expressive ends—drab and brown in Bowery scenes; lurid and garish in sideshow scenes. = Burlesque and the Bowery = The drawings of burlesque and vaudeville acts Marsh made in the 1920s for the New York Daily News are among the first of his many images of popular theater. Such entertainments flourished throughout the country and were available all over New York City. The burlesque that Marsh captured can be described as raunchy and vulgar, but also comedic and satiric. Marsh's drawings depict chorus girls, clowns, theater goers and strippers. Burlesque was \\"the theater of the common man; it expressed the humor, and fantasies of the poor, the old, and the ill-favored.\\" Marsh continued his burlesque sketches during his trip to Paris in 1925. In 1930, Marsh was well off; he was successful in his career and had inherited a portion of his grandfather's money. Nonetheless, the lower class members of society were his preferred subject matter, as he contended that \\"well bred people are no fun to paint\\". Marsh's Bowery scenes depict people who had a crisis thrust upon them, which is why his work shows a loss of human integrity and control in all aspects. His etching Bread Line—No One Has Starved (1932) depicts a row of men in a frieze-like arrangement that emphasizes their immobility. (The print's title mocks a complacent remark made by President Hoover.) = Coney Island and sea ports = Marsh liked to venture out to Coney Island to paint, especially in the summer time. There he began to paint massed beached bodies. Marsh emphasizes the bold muscles and build of his characters, which relate to the heroic scale of the older European paintings. Marsh said \\"I like to go to Coney Island because of the sea, the open air, and the crowds—crowds of people in all directions, in all positions, without clothing, moving—like the great compositions of Michelangelo and Rubens.\\" Marsh was also drawn to the ports of New York. In the 1930s, the harbors were extremely busy with people and commerce due to the country's necessity for economic recovery. The Great Depression brought about a decline in raw materials and therefore the demand for those materials grew dramatically, resulting in bustling harbors in big cities such as New York. Marsh would sketch the seaports, focusing on the tugboats coming in and out of the harbor, and capturing the details of the boats such as the masts, the bells, the sirens, and the deck chairs. = New York City crowds and women = As on Coney Island, Marsh captured the crowds of the bustling inner city life. Marsh spent a lot of his time on the sidewalks, the subways, the nightclubs, bars and restaurants finding the crowds. He also loved to single people out on the trains, in the parks, or in ballrooms to capture a single human figure in isolation from the rest of the city. Marsh was obsessed with the American woman as a sexual and powerful figure. In the 1930s during the Great Depression, more than 2 million women lost their jobs, and women were said to be exploited sexually. Marsh's work shows this exploitation by portraying men and women in the same paintings. The women may be half clothed or fully naked, and are purposeful and strong; the men are voyeurs, often less imposing than the women. According to art historian Marilyn Cohen, \\"[Marsh's] world is filled with display: movies, burlesque, the beach, and all forms of public exhibition. Men and women are both spectators and performers within a heavily sexualized world. And Marsh was clearly fascinated by both aspects of that world—almost always presenting its two sides in the same image.\\"  Later life  His work was part of the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. During the 1940s and for many years, Marsh became an important teacher at the Art Students League of New York, which ran a summer camp where Marsh's students included Roy Lichtenstein.Roy Lichtenstein Lichtenstein was influenced by Marsh's subject matter in his work. Also in the '40s, Marsh began making drawings for magazines such as Esquire, Fortune, and Life. A degree of mannerism is apparent in his later paintings, in which wraithlike figures \\"float in a watery netherworld\\" in a deeper pictorial space than that of his compositions of the 1930s. Shortly before his death he received the Gold Medal for Graphic Arts awarded by the American Academy and the National Institute for Arts and Letters. Marsh died from a heart attackReginald Marsh Papers, 1897–1955 in Dorset, Vermont on July 3, 1954.  Legacy  Many of his prints and thousands of unpublished sketches were found in his estate after he died. They revealed more of the true depth of his work. Because Marsh made good records of his work, often on a daily basis, it was easy to find his unpublished works and publish them. A set of prints that were acquired by William Benton from Marsh's wife are now all in the William Benton Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, and the Middendorf Gallery in Washington, D.C.

Biography Crabb is a founder member of Pop Will Eat Itself. He was the main songwriter (Clint Mansell also wrote) and drummer until the release of Box Frenzy in 1987, after which he became vocalist and co-frontman with Mansell. He worked with PWEI until 1995, and then formed Golden Claw Musics. =Golden Claw Musics= Golden Claw Musics was the main musical project of Crabb after he left Pop Will Eat Itself in 1995. In 1993, he remixed Pop Will Eat Itself's \\"Get the Girl, Kill the Baddies\\" as a B-side called \\"Part Man Part Machine\\", prompting him to release more of his ambient material. A remix of Pop Will Eat Itself's song \\"Cape Connection\\" was released on the limited 2CD edition of the album, Two Fingers, My Friends!. Crabb released the album All Blue Review, as well as an accompanying single for \\"Digging the Dancing Weed\\", with Eno engineer Marcus Dravs on Infectious Records in July 1994. Despite Crabb leaving PWEI to focus on Golden Claw Musics, they have not released any more material to date. =Current projects= After the Golden Claw Musics project, Crabb disappeared from the music industry, although he made appearances on former PWEI members' albums. In 2005, PWEI played a few reformation shows in the UK, which led to formation of Vileevils with Fuzz Townshend and Adam Mole. Vile Evils disbanded in February 2010 after releasing four singles on US label dPulse. Crabb has recently remixed KMFDM, Revolting Cocks (2009), and US Grammy winner Kevin Max (2010). Crabb recently put together a new version of Pop Will Eat Itself to celebrate the band's 25th year in 2011. In July 2011, a new line-up of PWEI was announced, featuring Crabb as the only original member. In October 2011, the album New Noise Designed by a Sadist was released on Cooking Vinyl, to be followed by a UK tour. In June 2013 it was announced Crabb had joined the industrial collective Primitive Race. The group have since released an EP and an album, both with prominent input from Crabb. In late 2014, Crabb began work on a new solo project known as Je Suis Crabbi.

Universal Pictures Corporation, 45 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1930), was a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case on copyright infringement by non-literal copying of a dramatic work. The Court held that copyright protection cannot be extended to the characteristics of stock characters in a story, whether it be a book, play, or film. Facts The plaintiff, playwright Anne Nichols, was the author of Abie's Irish Rose, a 1922 play about a young Jewish man who marries an Irish Catholic girl against the wishes of both of their fathers, with hilarity ensuing. The defendant then produced The Cohens and Kellys (1926) (which the court referred to as \\"The Cohens and the Kellys\\"), a film based on a play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families, with hilarity ensuing. A lawsuit followed, with the plaintiff asserting copyright infringement based on the defendant's use of similar story elements. The question before the Court was whether the defendant's film infringed the plaintiff's copyright in the play by using similar elements. Opinion of the Court Judge Learned Hand, writing for the Court, noted that protection of literature cannot be limited to the exact text, or else an infringer could get away with copying by making trivial changes. The question then is whether the part taken was 'substantial'. However, it is impossible to set a firm boundary demarcating the line between work and ideas, he said, stating, \\"her copyright did not cover everything that might be drawn from her play; its content went to some extent into the public domain.\\" In this case, there was no infringement, as the ideas that are copied are really universal concepts and stock characters.

It is currently occupied by the headquarters of Argyll and Bute Council. The gardens are open to the public and form part of a country park on the former estate. The house is protected as a category B listed building. History There was a church at Kilmory in ancient times, and in the 1550s the church and lands of Kilmory were held by the Abbot of Paisley. In 1575 the estate was owned by Donald Campbell of Kilmory, and remained in the Campbell family for over 250 years. A house may have stood here as early as the 14th century.Coventry, p.274 The Campbells built a house, or extended the existing one, in 1816–20.Walker, p.107 Eliza Campbell, the eldest daughter and co-heir of Peter Campbell, married Sir John Orde, 2nd Baronet in 1824. He purchased the estates following the death of his father in law in 1828 and of his wife in 1829. Orde demolished the modest old Campbell house and replaced it with a grand Gothic style mansion designed by architect Joseph Gordon Davis. The core of the older house was retained, but was extended into an L-plan, with new exterior and interior decoration, and a large octagonal tower at the south-west corner. Orde also greatly expanded and improved the grounds and estate, engaging William Hooker to extend the gardens in 1830. Further extensions were carried out in the 1860s. Orde was buried in the private burial ground adjacent to the house in 1878. His son succeeded to the baronetcy, and changed his name to Campbell-Orde in 1880. The Campbell- Orde baronets retained the estate until 1938. It passed through several owners thereafter, and served variously as a hotel, hostel and conference centre. In March 1949 an announcement was made that it would open in June as a national holiday centre for young people. In July 1971 it was designated a category B listed building. In 1974, Argyll County Council purchased the house to serve as a headquarters for Argyll and Bute District Council, which was formed in 1975. In 1995 local government was reorganised again, although Kilmory remained in use as the headquarters of the new Argyll and Bute unitary authority. An office block extension was built onto the house in 1980–82, to increase the provision of space. Fire damaged the main house the following year, and many interiors had to be refurbished.

Career =Minor leagues= Donnelly was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 27th round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft. The White Sox released him in April 1993. In June 1993, he signed with the Chicago Cubs organization; the Cubs released him before the start of the 1994 season. In 1994, he played for the independent Ohio Valley Redcoats. In March 1995, he signed with the Cincinnati Reds and participated in Spring Training as a replacement player during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. As a result of his participation as a replacement player, Donnelly is permanently barred from joining the Major League Baseball Players Association. Donnelly remained in the Reds organization until he was released in April 1999. He started the 1999 season with the independent Nashua Pride. In May 1999, he was purchased by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was released on August 12, 1999. On August 18, 1999, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was released on August 25, 1999. On August 26, 1999, he was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays. He was released in July 2000. In August 2000, he signed with the Chicago Cubs. He became a free agent after the 2000 season. =Anaheim Angels= In January 2001, he signed with the Anaheim Angels, where he made his major league debut in 2002 at 30 years of age. He was an immediate fan favorite because of his intensity, the goggles that he wears, and his effectiveness as the main setup man to Troy Percival. Donnelly would go on to play an integral part of the Angels' bullpen in their 2002 championship season, serving as the winning pitcher in Game 6 of the World Series. He was the third replacement player to win the World Series, behind both Shane Spencer of the 1998, 1999 and 2000 New York Yankees and Damian Miller of the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2003, in that same role, Donnelly put up a 1.58 earned run average and became a rare example of a non-closer who was selected as an All-Star. Donnelly went on to be the winning pitcher in that mid-summer classic. He suffered a broken nose during spring training 2004, causing him to miss a large portion of the season. Donnelly remained fairly effective throughout 2004 in a very good bullpen for the American League West Champion Anaheim Angels. In 2005, Donnelly began to see a decline in performance, including a decrease in velocity on his fastball as a set-up man for closer Francisco Rodríguez after Percival's departure. In June 2005, Donnelly was suspended ten days for having pine tar on his glove., an incident that caused a scrum and accusations that former teammate Jose Guillen tipped manager Frank Robinson The suspension was the culmination of three weeks of extra scrutiny on Donnelly from opposing managers and umpires, including an accusation from then-Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén accusing Donnelly of touching his mouth too often. He would later advocate for the legalization of pine tars for pitchers. In 2006, Donnelly continued to drop down the depth chart in the bullpen becoming an inconsistent middle reliever. =Boston Red Sox= On December 15, 2006, Donnelly was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Phil Seibel. On July 31, 2007, it was announced that Donnelly would need Tommy John surgery. During his absence, the Red Sox would eventually go on to win the 2007 World Series. Donnelly became a free agent after the 2007 season. =Cleveland Indians= On February 6, 2008, the Cleveland Indians signed Donnelly to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. The Indians hoped Donnelly would provide bullpen help at the end of the season when he recovered from Tommy John surgery. Donnelly was brought up to the Indians in August 2008, as a replacement for Tom Mastny. =2009= In February 2009, he was signed by the Texas Rangers. He was released in March 2009. In April 2009, he signed with the Houston Astros. He was released on July 1, 2009. On July 5, 2009, Donnelly signed with the Florida Marlins. He became a free agent after the 2009 season. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On January 16, 2010, Donnelly agreed with the Pittsburgh Pirates on a one-year deal worth $1.5 million.http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7017542958?Pirates%20Ink%20Reliever%20Donnelly%20To%20One- Year,%20$1.5M%20Pact Before he could reach incentives that would have approximately doubled his salary, the Pirates released Donnelly in July 2010 denying that the incentives were the reason for the release. He was the last of the replacement players still in the major leagues, signifying no conciliatory admittance into the MLBPA more than 15 years after His likeness, name, and uniform number were still replaced by fictional players in video games. =Retirement= He announced his retirement on March 9, 2011. Mitchell Report Donnelly was named in the December 13, 2007 Mitchell Report regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. According to former clubhouse attendant and admitted steroids distributor Kirk Radomski, Donnelly sought him out in 2004 looking to purchase oxandrolone, an anabolic steroid. Radomski says he made one sale of nandrolone to Donnelly, for which he received $250–$300. In a statement in response to the report, Donnelly admitted contacting Radomski in 2004 regarding oxandrolone, hoping it would help him recover from injuries faster. Donnelly denied ever buying or using the drug because he was made aware that it was considered a steroid.

Mount Babel is the central peak of the Manicouagan crater and was formed by the rebound of the crust after the impact of a meteor 210 million years ago. The mountain and reservoir are of particular interest to geologists due to the shock metamorphosis it endured. Biodiversity Mount Babel is also a valuable research ground for biologists. One can find montane and alpine climate zones there, since meteorological conditions become increasingly extreme towards the summit. These conditions create a quick transition from boreal forest to tundra, where there can be found lichen and other arctic life forms that would normally be observed hundreds of kilometres further north.

Magee, Jr. and his wife Kathy Magee. It is headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In addition to providing cleft lip and palate repair surgeries to children worldwide, Operation Smile works as a non-governmental organization to reduce the occurrence of cleft lips and palates worldwide; develops ambassadorships to raise awareness of cleft issues; sponsors a world care program for international cases requiring special care; organizes foundations worldwide to assist countries in reaching self-sufficiency with cleft surgeries; hosts a U.S. care network to assist families in the U.S. with cleft issues and develops and administers worldwide education programs related to cleft issues; and organizes student leadership programs. Operation Smile has provided over 220,000 surgeries for children and young adults born with cleft lips, cleft palates, and other facial deformities in over 60 countries since 1982, at no cost to the recipients. As of 2018, Operation Smile provided on-going care around the world at 34 smile centers. According to its tax report, Operation Smile completed 156 medical missions in 80 sites globally, including 13 sites in extremely poor regions. During missions, over 35,000 dental procedures were performed in the year 2018.  Early History of Operation Smile  Chittagong, Bangladesh – Operation Smile team members aboard the Military Sealift Command (MSC) hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH-19), perform a cleft lip surgery Operation Smile was founded by Bill and Kathy Magee (Dr. William P. Magee Jr., D.D.S., M.D. and Kathleen S. Magee, B.S.N., M.Ed., M.S.W.). In 1982 Dr. Magee, a plastic surgeon, and Kathy Magee, who was then a social worker and a nurse, were invited to join a Philippine cleft repair mission with a group of medical volunteers. When they realized that the group would not return to the Philippines though there were many remaining who needed surgery, they established Operation Smile. Dr. Magee said, The Magee's completed two return trips to Naga City, treating 400 children. The scope of the organization increased after Mother Teresa invited Operation Smile to come to India to treat deformed children. In 1987, Operation Smile launched the Physicians’ Program, which brought doctors from the countries where it hosted medical missions to Norfolk, Virginia, to train with Dr. Magee. That same year Operation Smile completed its First medical mission to Kenya. Within the next two years, Operation Smile received a Presidential Citation for Private Sector Initiatives from President Ronald Reagan, and was adopted as a service project by the General Federation of Women’s Clubs. In 1995, Operation Smile opened its first care center, offering patients cleft treatments year-round, in Duitama, Colombia. After establishing the Global Headquarters location in Norfolk, VA, Operation Smile began foundations in different countries like Australia, UK, Italy, Vietnam, and Ireland. Dr. Magee is currently employed as the Chief Executive Officer of Operation Smile and is a faculty member of both the Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and Eastern Virginia Medical School. His wife, Kathy Magee, serves as the president on a full-time, volunteer basis and is a lifetime member of the Board of Directors. Programs Operation Smile organizes international volunteer missions to provide cleft lip and cleft palate repair in developing countries, coordinates programs for training physicians from around the world, manages programs to assist host countries in reaching cleft lip and cleft palate repair self- sufficiency, supports education and research programs to eradicate cleft lips and palates, and organizes global volunteer programs for high-school and college students. =Surgical missions= For each mission, Operation Smile verifies the credentials and organizes the participation and travel arrangements for a team of volunteers. The team typically includes a mission site coordinator, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, a pediatrician, an intensive care physician, head or coordinating nurse, pre- and post-op nurses, child development specialists, speech pathologists, dentists and/or orthodontists. Teams work with local volunteers from the host nation as well as from other nations. Many of the volunteers provide non-medical logistical support including translation, medical records support, clinical photography or help with food services, lodging, procurement of supplies, and transportation. Mission teams typically include two high school students who make presentations on health maintenance and dental hygiene to families living near the mission site. Operation Smile coordinates the donation, purchase and delivery of medical provisions (equipment, medications, supplies) for each mission. During the fiscal year of 2018, Operation Smile hosted 156 medical missions in 80 unique sites around the world and provided free surgical care for over 12,00 children and young adults. Nearly 82% of medical professionals volunteering with Operation Smile were from low and middle income countries. The medical volunteers provided approximately 397,312 hours of free care for Operation Smile's patients. Operation Smile's partner countries include: * Australia * Bolivia * Bangladesh, Site: USNS Mercy * Brazil, Site: Fortaleza * Cambodia, Site: Phnom Penh * Canada * China, Site:Qujing * Colombia, Site: Buenaventura * Ecuador * Egypt * Ethiopia * Gaza Strip/West Bank * Honduras * India * Iraq (In 2007 the health minister of Iraq's Kurdistan region, Dr. Zorban Othman, announced that Operation Smile would treat 51 Kurdish children in nearby Jordan. The doctor stated, \\"the step was taken because of the bad security conditions in other areas of Iraq, which makes it impossible for foreign physicians to come\\".) * Jordan * Kenya * Laos * Mexico * Morocco * Nicaragua; sites: Puerto Cabezas, Managua, Chinandega, Estelí, Granada, Matagalpa, Juigalpa * Panama * Paraguay * Guatemala * Peru, Site: Salaverry * Philippines * Russia * South Africa * Singapore * South Korea * Thailand * United Kingdom * Venezuela * Vietnam, Sites:Vũng Tàu, Quảng Nam. =Ambassadors= *Carmit Bachar *Mark Burnett *John Salley *Melanie Dunea and Nigel Parry *Taylor Kinney *Charice *David Pomeranz *Jessica Simpson *Roselyn Sánchez *Roma Downey *Billy Bush *Brooke Burke *Whitney Cummings *Nicole Lapin *Satcha Pretto *Deidre Hall *Eric Winter *Oscar D'León *Molly Sims *Zachary Levi *Jay Manuel *Regine Velasquez *Justin Chatwin *Jackie Chan *Michael Trevino *Jennifer Salk *Olivia Wells *Keegan Longueira *Pritika Swarup *Kate Walsh *Ha Ji-won *Aom Sushar =World Care Program= Patients with conditions too serious to treat in their own countries can become World Care patients and come to the United States. On a case by case basis, Operation Smile will bring severe craniofacial cases to Norfolk, Virginia, and all around the U.S. when mission conditions are inappropriate for the severity of the case. As of June 2007, approximately 200 world care patients had been treated. =Foundations= Operation Smile has in-country global foundations that raise money and awareness to support its programs. Mission teams are hosted by international foundations that are responsible for in-country logistics, fund raising and mission awareness. Through partnerships with the American Heart Association, as well as with medical and teaching institutions, healthcare professionals from developing countries receive evidence-based education and hands-on training and mentoring. Operation smile also has sponsored conferences, seminar workshops, rotation programs, visiting professorships, and short and long term fellowships. To aid countries in becoming self- sufficient at caring for cleft patients, beginning in early 2007 the organization planned to open comprehensive care medical clinics in Colombia, Honduras, Morocco, China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam. The centers provide surgeries and treatment, educate local volunteers, perform local development activities and manage local communications / administrative services. The center in Vietnam expected to treat 2,000 patients annually and to train about 1,000 medical professionals. As of 2018, Operation Smile now offers over 30 comprehensive care clinics around the world. =U.S. care network= Operation Smile provides a network of resources to assist families in the U.S. with children born with facial deformities. This network is accessed through the Operation Smile website and includes a listing of referral websites and a physicians resource list with the names of doctors available to review a case. =Education= Operation Smile provides a framework for its partner countries to come together to share knowledge, technology and skills through the use of programs customized to each country's specific medical infrastructure. University partnerships offer Operation Smile medical volunteers training in advanced techniques and provide opportunities including fellowships, emeritus professorships and visiting professorship programs. Education exchange programs are also offered through partnerships with leading medical teaching institutions. The annual Operation Smile Physicians' Training Program (PTP) brings surgeons from around the world to the United States for training in specialized surgical skills. The program has helped train more than 650 international physicians in advanced craniofacial techniques. Operation Smile has hosted two global summits on medical standards in Norfolk, Virginia. Operation Smile attempts to hold yearly summits to offer medical training and advancement for medical workers around the globe. In 2017, they partnered with St. Luke's Medical Center in the Philippines to offer medically-focused skills workshops to its participants. =Student programs= Operation Smile student programs encourages students to lead clubs and raise awareness of health in other countries. Operation Smile engages students from around the world through an annual International Student Leadership Conference (ISLC) which convenes high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors who want to make a difference in global health. The International Student Leadership Conference (ISLC) is a big aspect of the Operation Smile student programs. Once every year, 500-700 students from around the world meet to discuss the world's issues and how to solve them with a specific focus on medical care equity. In 2018, the ISLC that took place in Seattle, WA included more than 300 students from across the globe, including China, Vietnam, Ireland, Panama, South Africa and Canada that learned how to advocate for children born with a cleft lip, cleft palate or other facial deformity. During the conference, students also learned about global health, joined in peer-to- peer leadership training and participated in service projects to benefit Operation Smile patients, as well as staff at Seattle Children’s Hospital. Operation Smile offers students the opportunity to qualify to travel internationally. Before the students go on a mission, they must apply and be selected to attend one of two annual Mission Training Workshops (MTW). The workshops cover four health modules: dental hygiene, oral re-hydration therapy, nutrition, and burn care and prevention. Students make posters for each of these modules and present them on the missions, educating families on simple life-safety principles. At OpSmile headquarters, students train as mission ambassadors in developing countries. On training completion, students may be selected for an international mission. = Global Essential Surgery Initiatives = In rural northeastern Nicaragua, work is underway through a pilot project called Cirugía para el Pueblo – “Surgery for the People.” Operation Smile and the Ministry of Health seek to improve the surgical infrastructure of the hospitals and to spread awareness about surgically- treatable conditions to the people of the region. The project will provide places like Nicaragua with education and awareness of common surgical diseases. These manuals will be used at the local health clinics in the remote villages, so people will be able to understand that their condition can be cured by surgery. Another part of this project is to provide needed equipment supplies and possible solutions to the lack of human resources, space to operate, and overall clean water. Operation Smile offers education in safe surgical conditions in Ethiopia and Rwanda, where they have offered surgical training rotations for general surgeons to learn reconstructive plastic surgery techniques -- since 2012 in Ethiopia and since 2015 in Rwanda. The two-week training courses for Ethiopian surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses take place at JUSH (Jimma University Specialized Hospital), the only hospital serving the 15 million-plus people living in Ethiopia’s southwestern region. The rotations cover cleft surgery as well as techniques to better heal burn, trauma and surgical wounds, representing the bulk of the hospital’splastic surgery cases. Starting in 2015, Operation Smile partnered with the University of Rwanda, Partners In Health and the Rwandan Ministry of Health to host twice-annual surgical training rotations. Since then, 17 Rwandan general surgery residents have received hands-on training and education through the rotations. Operation Smile has also worked to improve the skills of local anesthesiologists. Through a grant secured by Operation Smile Sweden through the Swedish Postcode Lottery, Operation Smile will help establish the country’s first-ever postgraduate reconstructive plastic surgery certification program in partnership with the University of Rwanda and Rwanda’s ministries of education and health. The program is scheduled to begin in September 2019 with its first graduates receiving certifications in 2022. On April 2nd, 2019 in the Vietnam Ministry of Health hosted a conference on patient safety and surgical safety that involved Operation Smile's participation. The achievement of collaboration between the Medical Services Administration of Vietnam MoH and Operation Smile comes after a Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2014 with a goal to increase access to quality standards for safe surgery in Vietnam During the recent conference, Operation Smile worked with the MoH, World Health Organization, and other organizations, to implement the set of eight Quality Standards for Safe Surgery. The project started with the assessment of current surgical capacity in the country and included hospitals representing all socio-economic zones in Vietnam. The assessment results served as the baseline information for specialists to develop appropriate and feasible safe surgery standards for Vietnam. The drafting team used WHOs' document \\"Safe Surgery Saves Lives,\\" as well as Operation Smile's Global Standards of Care as references for development of the Standards. The adoption of Safe Surgery Standards will have potential to impact three million surgeries annually throughout Vietnam. Awards and milestones In 1996, Operation Smile was the first recipient of the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize. In 1997, Dr. Bill Magee and Kathy Magee receive the Servitor Pacis Award from The Path to Peace Foundation. In 1999, Kathleen Magee was awarded the World of Children Award for her contributions to helping vulnerable children through her efforts with Operation Smile. Dr. Magee received the 2001 Antonio Feltrinelli Prize (Premi \\"Antonio Feltrinelli\\") awarded by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, which represents the National Academy of Science in Italy, for Exceptional Endeavors of Outstanding Moral and Humanitarian Value. Dr. Magee presented the Honorary Kazanjian Lecture to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, and in 1998 received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Kathleen Magee received the 1997 Servants of Peace Award from the U.N. Representative to the Vatican. *In 2001 a documentary on the work by Operation Smile won the Best Medical Documentary at the US Circle of Excellence Media Awards and was a finalist in the New York Film Festival Awards for Best Humanitarian Documentary. The Facemakers: Operation Smile is a co-production by BBC One and the Discovery Channel in conjunction with Century Films. It documents the remarkable changes that occurred in the lives of three children as a result of Operation Smile's visit to Davao City in the Philippines in 1999. The fifty-minute programme was first aired on 21 June 2001. Two of the children received surgery during the mission. Nine-year-old Rozal Garces was treated for her cleft lip, and four-year-old Amorjoy Felipe had a cleft lip and palate revision. The third child, Abel Gastardo, had a condition too severe to be treated during the time of the mission. Abel suffered from a nasofrontal facial encephalocele, an extreme protrusion of brain tissue from the front of his skull. The film follows Abel to the United States to receive corrective surgery, seven months later. He was brought over by Operation Smile to receive major surgery in Virginia at the Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters. * To mark its 25th anniversary in November 2007, Operation Smile undertook the World Journey of Smiles (WJOS), a single campaign that included 40 simultaneous missions over a period of two weeks in 25 countries—beginning with the return to the site of Operations Smile's first mission. During WJOS, Operation Smile completed 4,200 cleft lip/palate surgeries with 1,700 volunteers from 43 countries. The World Journey of Smiles also collected DNA samples from 4,200 children—the largest sampling ever made and now housed at Yale University. * Bill and Kathy Magee were honored on March 1, 2008, with the Norfolk First Citizen Distinguished Service Award. *Bill Magee was awarded the American Society of Plastic Surgeons’ Honorary Citation Award in 2014, and the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons’ Tagliacozzi Award in 2013. *In 2014, Kathy Magee received a prestigious honorary doctorate from the Karolinska Instituet in Sweden. She has also remained active in the World of Children organization and serves as a member of the Executive Committee for the Hilton Laureates Collaborative. 1999-2002: Criticism and response In November 1999, specific patient deaths brought criticism on Operation Smile's medical procedures, suggesting the organization prioritized publicity and volume over patient welfare and safety. In response, Operation Smile conducted an internal review. Initially, the organization \\"promised to make public the full findings of the review\\", though later chose not to release the findings, considering the review an internal matter. Several directors disagreed with this choice and left the board. Four months after announcing the review, the organization publicly acknowledged organizational flaws. By 2002, the organization also established medical credential standards, improved medical monitoring of patients, and implemented quality and financial controls. Operation Smile and Smile Train In early 2011, Smile Train and Operation Smile announced the two charities would merge, followed three weeks later by announcements the merger had been aborted, Smile Train having canceled the union. Smile Train's board also named Priscilla Ma the executive director of the organization, while other board members and directors stepped down. Following the failed merger, Operation Smile \\"spun-off\\" the Operation Smile Foundation. The Foundation was renamed Stop Cleft International, a 501(c)3 organization. Stop Cleft International became a subsidiary of Smile Train in July, 2013. Operation Smile paid an agreed upon obligation of $4,000,000 to Stop Cleft International/Smile Train during tax year 2013. http://www.operationsmile.org/downloadables/about-us/financials/fy14-990.pdf In 2009, Smile Train initiated an advertising campaign in the Richmond Times highlighting Smile Train's attempts between 2006 and 2009 to donate nearly $9 million to Operation Smile, the organization Brian Mullaney had split from in 1998 in what Mullaney described as a \\"messy divorce.\\" In the ad, Mullaney contended Operation Smile was refusing money that could benefit children, later calling the situation \\"shameful\\"; Mullaney also noted that he respects that in some countries need overwhelms available doctors and he had \\"a newfound respect for what Operation Smile does.\\" The Virginian Pilot outlined the history and differences between the two organizations and indicated Mullaney wanted the two organizations to reconcile. At the time, Dr. Magee of Operation Smile declined a newspaper interview, and Operation Smile formally responded to the ad campaign, saying the two organizations \\"have different operating philosophies and business ethics,\\" and that Operation Smile would continue foregoing donations from an \\"unproductive relationship.\\" Financial information * Operation Smile's 2019 digital annual report shows cash revenues of $74,196,686 and combined fundraising and administrative expenditures of $27,658,158 (37.2%). The fundraising figure does not include an additional 'educational and sustainability' spend of $19,441,324 which, under IRS SOP 98-2 may include fundraising products and campaigns which include educational components. * Operation Smile’s 2018 digital annual report shows total revenue of $104,624,958. The report indicates fundraising and administrative expenditures of $27,000,246 (28.7% of expenses). *Operation Smile's 2017 digital financial report shows cash revenues of $59,215,636. The report shows fundraising/administrative expenditures of $26,016,760 (43.9%). * Operation Smile's 2013 financial overview report shows an income of $49,516,821 in cash contributions. The report indicates an expenditure of $23,189,296 for fundraising and administration. * In 2011, Forbes ranked Operation Smile as the tenth \\"least efficient\\" large U.S. charity, tied with the Alzheimer's Association and just ahead in efficiency of the American Cancer Society. Forbes noted that \\"financial efficiency is far from the whole story when it comes to assessing a charity's vitality or even effectiveness.\\" * Operation Smile spends 42% of the money donated to the charity on fundraising and administration, including a salary of $350,000 (and an additional $27,915 in other compensation) for its chief executive. * The NGO raised $35,024,864 during the fiscal year ending June 2008.

A rough and gritty film, this is the second of their three collaborations, following Husbands and preceding Opening Night'. Timothy Carey, Seymour Cassel, Morgan Woodward, Meade Roberts, and Azizi Johari appear in supporting roles.Silver, Alain; Ward, Elizabeth; eds. (1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. Gazzara's character of the formidable strip club owner Cosmo Vittelli was in part based on an impersonation he did for his friend Cassavetes in the 1970s. In an interview for the Criterion Collection in the mid-2000s, Gazzara stated that he believed Vittelli, who cares deeply about the rather peculiar \\"art\\" aspect of the routines put on at his nightclub but can't get his patrons (who are only there for naked girls) to, was a double of sorts of Cassavetes himself. Plot Cosmo Vittelli owns and operates a nightclub, Crazy Horse West, on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Though Cosmo spends a great deal of time and effort designing and choreographing the venue's artistic burlesque act, he fears his customers are there only to see the naked bodies of his performers. Cosmo makes the final payment on a seven-year gambling debt to a loan shark named Marty, and in return invites him and his mob associates to the club's night act. Eager to celebrate his newfound freedom, Cosmo goes on a night on the town with his three favorite dancers (Margo, Rachel, and Sherry), and subsequently racks up a $23,000 poker debt, returning him to the position he'd just left. Although Cosmo insists he is good for the money over time, Marty’s partners force Cosmo to sign over the Crazy Horse West as collateral. Troubled over how to retain his business and resolve the debt, Cosmo drops the girls off at their homes. The following night, gangster Mort and his associates arrive at the club and order Cosmo to find and kill a bookie named Harold Ling in exchange for wiping out his outstanding debt. When Cosmo procrastinates, Mort has one of his men rough him up and make it clear the killing must be completed immediately. Mort gives Cosmo a gun, a car, and the location of Ling's house. After they explain that the bookie’s house is guarded and booby- trapped, the men give Cosmo a receipt for the money he owes them and encourage him to tear it up, proving that the hit will cancel his debt. Though they insist the target is simply a low-level bookie, they inadvertently reveal his real name as Benny Wu, raising Cosmo's suspicions. On the freeway heading to Wu’s house, the tire on Cosmo’s car blows out but he finds a payphone and calls a cab. The cab takes Cosmo to a restaurant where, as instructed, he picks up hamburgers to distract the guard dogs at Wu’s home. Making his way to the bookie’s room, Cosmo finds Wu naked in his spa. As Cosmo takes aim at the old man, Wu confesses that he has been a bad person and tells Cosmo he is sorry. After killing Wu, Cosmo shoots several bodyguards and makes a run for it, but is shot by a stray bullet in the process. Cosmo takes a bus, then several cabs to Rachel’s house, where he collapses on the bed. Rachel’s mother, Betty, whom Cosmo calls “Mom,” tends to his wound, but she refuses his request to call a cab to take him to the club. Meanwhile, Mort learns of the successful hit but Cosmo's apparent survival, and orders his right-hand man Flo to kill Cosmo. Cosmo makes it back to the club, where Flo is waiting for him and tries to persuade him to leave. A topless Rachel approaches their table and a half-delirious Cosmo tells her that he is going to buy her a diamond ring and asks her to tell him that she loves him. Flo drags Cosmo to an empty parking garage where he admits he considers them friends before passing him on to Mort. Mort admits to Cosmo that Wu was actually a high- ranking Chinese Triad boss and Cosmo was set up to perform a task that Mort’s men found impossible to accomplish, a task he was never meant to survive. Mort claims he can protect Cosmo, but is only distracting him long enough for one of his men to get a clear shot. Cosmo kills Mort and escapes to Betty's house, asking where Rachel is before rambling on about his own mother and telling Betty that she's \\"wonderful\\". Betty tells Cosmo off, ordering him to leave her and Rachel's house and never come back. Cosmo returns to the club and talks to his performers, motivating them by telling them that each person has their own truths and sense of happiness. He confesses that he is only happy when he is angry, or when he is playing the role of a person that others want him to be. He encourages the troupe to take on their theatrical personalities so that those in the audience can escape their troubles and also pretend to be who they are not. Cosmo takes the stage and tells the audience they are running late because Rachel has left and confesses to the crowd that he loved her. He walks outside and observes blood dripping from his bullet wound as the show begins.

At a May 17, 2008, George Eastman House screening in Rochester, Gazzara said he \\"hated\\" the original cut; \\"it's too long\\", he had told Cassavetes. Eventually, Cassavetes decided to re-edit the film, and it was re-released in 1978 in a new 108-minute cut. The 1978 version is the one that has been in general release since that time, though both versions of the film were issued in The Criterion Collection's John Cassavetes: Five Films box set, marking the first appearance of the 1976 version since its original release. True to Cassavetes' form, the 108-minute version is not just a simple edit of the 135-minute version. The order of several scenes has been changed, there are different edits of a few scenes, and there are a few segments unique to the 108-minute version. The bulk of the cutting in the 1978 version removed many of the nightclub routines that were in the 1976 version. Reception The Killing of a Chinese Bookie received mixed reviews upon its initial release, but has developed a cult following since. Jay Cocks of Time gave the film a positive review, explaining, \\"When John Cassavetes makes a gangster movie, you can be sure only that it will be like no other. A film maker of vaunting, demanding individuality, Cassavetes is like a jazz soloist, an improviser who tears off on wild riffs from a basic, familiar melody.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times thought differently, saying, \\"The Killing of a Chinese Bookie is like the last three of the director's films (A Woman Under the Influence, Husbands and Minnie and Moskowitz) in the way it resolutely refuses to come to a point strong or interesting enough to support the loving care that's gone into its production, particularly on the part of the actors.\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 79% of 28 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.45 out of 10.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise ferries a deaf ambassador (Howie Seago) who leads difficult peace talks. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise, commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), is set to take aboard Riva (Howie Seago), a renowned and successful negotiator, to help resolve a centuries-old war between two tribes on planet Solais V. Riva is deaf and mute due to a hereditary genetic deficiency, but travels with a \\"chorus\\" (Marnie Mosiman, Thomas Oglesby, and Leo Damian), an entourage of three people in telepathic communication with him, who are able to enunciate his thoughts. Riva dismisses the Enterprise crew's briefing on the history of the conflict, explaining that the dispute has long since become personal, regardless of whatever tangible concerns that may have started it. When Riva, his chorus, and several Enterprise officers beam down for the meeting, one tribal delegate fires upon them, killing the chorus. The tribe's leader immediately brands him a traitor and executes him, begging for the talks to continue, but the away team has already begun emergency transport back to the Enterprise amid the chaos. Riva, frustrated and agitated, struggles to communicate with the crew, so Picard orders Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to find and learn Riva's sign language in order to act as a translator. Picard offers to take Riva's place at the mediation, but Riva believes the Solaian tribes will only cooperate with him. Riva is prepared to abandon the peace process and return to his home planet, accepting his failure, but Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) inspires him to stay, suggesting that he turn his disadvantage into an advantage, recalling Riva's own negotiating tactic. Riva returns to the meeting spot on the planet, and to the crew's surprise, tells them that they should leave, and he will signal Starfleet when the negotiations are complete, as they may take several months. In order for the tribes to work with Riva, they will both be forced to learn sign language from Riva, which will create a shared experience between them. Thus, Riva is turning his disadvantage of being unable to communicate into an advantage. The crew leaves Riva to await the tribe representatives. Production Howie Seago, who is deaf, approached the show's producers with the idea of a deaf mediator. The initial idea came from his wife, who is a fan of Star Trek. The writers originally wanted Seago's character to learn to speak after his chorus is killed, but Seago was opposed to the idea, as it could perpetuate the practice of forcing deaf children to speak. The producers were understanding of his concerns and wrote a new draft. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club rated the episode B- and wrote that the episode is \\"often painfully earnest in its philosophical meanderings, and it's nearly impossible to watch without snickering in places, but it's also thoughtful, sincere, and, if you can stop rolling your eyes long enough, inspiring.\\" References Bibliography * Star Trek The Next Generation DVD set, volume 2, disc 2, selection 1 External links  \\"Loud as a Whisper\\" at Ex Astris Scientia * \\"Loud as a Whisper\\" rewatch by Keith R.A.

It causes the infection of the host cell by sticking to the host cell using trimeric autotransporter adhesins.  Epidemiology  M. catarrhalis is a human pathogen with an affinity for the human upper respiratory tract. Other primates, such as macaques, might become infected by this bacterium. History M. catarrhalis was previously placed in a separate genus named Branhamella. The rationale for this was that other members of the genus Moraxella are rod-shaped and rarely caused infections in humans. However, results from DNA hybridization studies and 16S rRNA sequence comparisons were used to justify inclusion of the species M. catarrhalis in the genus Moraxella. As a consequence, the name Moraxella catarrhalis is currently preferred for these bacteria. Nevertheless, some in the medical field continue to call these bacteria Branhamella catarrhalis. Moraxella is named after Victor Morax, a Swiss ophthalmologist who first described this genus of bacteria. Catarrhalis is derived from catarrh, from the Greek meaning \\"to flow down\\" (cata- implies down; -rrh implies flow), describing the profuse discharge from eyes and nose typically associated with severe inflammation in colds.  Genetics  The whole genome sequence of M. catarrhalis CCUG 353 type strain was deposited and published in DNA Data Bank of Japan, European Nucleotide Archive, and GenBank in 2016 under the accession number LWAH00000000. Clinical significance These bacteria are known to cause otitis media, bronchitis, sinusitis, and laryngitis. Elderly patients and long-term heavy smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be aware that M. catarrhalis is associated with bronchopneumonia, as well as exacerbations of existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The peak rate of colonisation by M. catarrhalis appears to occur around 2 years of age, with a striking difference in colonization rates between children and adults (very high to very low). M. catarrhalis has recently been gaining attention as an emerging human pathogen. It has been identified as an important cause in bronchopulmonary infection, causing infection through pulmonary aspiration in the upper pulmonary tract. Additionally, it causes bacterial pneumonia, especially in adults with a compromised immune system. It has also been known to cause infective exacerbations in adults with chronic lung disease, and it is an important cause in acute sinusitis, maxillary sinusitis, bacteremia, meningitis, conjunctivitis, acute purulent irritation of chronic bronchitis, urethritis, sepsis (although this is rare), septic arthritis (which is also a rare occurrence),and acute laryngitis in adults and acute otitis media in children. M. catarrhalis is an opportunistic pulmonary invader, and causes harm especially in patients who have compromised immune systems or any underlying chronic disease. =Link with bacteremia= M. catarrhalis has also been linked with septic arthritis in conjunction with bacteremia. Although cases of bacteremia caused by M. catarrhalis have been reported before, this was the first instance in which bacteremia caused by M. catarrhalis was also associated with septic arthritis. A microbiological evaluation of the patient (a 41-year-old male) revealed that M. catarrhalis was the cause of the disease rather than Neisseria as was previously believed. This was also the second case of M. catarrhalis causing septic arthritis (although in the first case, no mention of bacteremia was made). Along with its relation to septic arthritis, bacteremia is also caused by M. catarrhalis infection, which can range in severity from a slight fever to lethal sepsis and an associated respiratory tract infection is usually also identified. Bacteremia infections caused by M. catarrhalis have a 21% mortality rate among patients. However, this may have been due to a lack of knowledge about the bacterium because of its recent recognition as a pathogen. Infection of high-grade bacteremia was linked with the development of endocarditis. However, the patients without endocarditis has been related to the background of each patient, especially the existence of other illnesses and any possible immune impairments they may have. Also, although bacteremia caused by M. catarrhalis has been infrequently reported, this may be due to a misdiagnosis or oversight because M. catarrhalis was only recently (1990s) identified as an important pathogen. Many chronic diseases in patients with M. catarrhalis bacteremia can be linked to the patients with immune defects or respiratory debility. Likewise, respiratory debility in patients with bacteremic pneumonia caused by M. catarrhalis infection can be linked with increased rates of pharyngeal colonization, enhancement of bacterial adherence to abnormal epithelium, and increased susceptibility of pulmonary parenchyma to infection. =Antibiotic resistance= Antibiotic sensitivity test: This strain shows resistance to ampicillin because it produces the enzyme β-lactamase. This is confirmed by the disc (nitrocefin) labelled β turning red. M. catarrhalis can be treated with antibiotics, but it is commonly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin. Current research priorities involve trying to find a suitable vaccine for this genotypically diverse organism, as well as determining factors involved with virulence, e.g. complement resistance. Lipooligosaccharide is considered one possible virulence factor. Since the recent recognition of M. catarrhalis as an important pathogenic microbe, development of a possible antibiotic has been ongoing. A fraction of M. catarrhalis strains seemed to be resistant to ampicillin, which makes ampicillin and amoxicillin inappropriate choices of antibiotic against it. Although all strains of M. catarrhalis were susceptible to cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, sulfadimidine, and tetracycline, they were also resistant to trimethoprim. M. catarrhalis resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ampicillin and amoxicillin, is mediated by periplasmic lipoprotein beta- lactamases BRO-1 and BRO-2, which protect the peptidoglycan layer by hydrolyzing the beta-lactam molecules that enter the bacterial cell. The beta- lactamases are produced in the cytoplasm and translocated to the periplasmic space by twin-arginine translocation pathway, which is a protein secretion pathway that transports proteins across a bilipid membrane in a folded state. M. catarrhalis produces and secretes beta-lactamase containing outer-membrane vesicles that can function as an extracellular delivery system of beta-lactam resistance that promotes the survival of otherwise beta-lactam sensitive bacteria in the vicinity of M. catarrhalis. This behavior is beneficial for the other bacteria and can make the antibiotic treatment of polymicrobial infections more difficult. Also, the resistance of M. catarrhalis to other antibiotics may be attributed to beta-lactamase, as well, because the use of these antibiotics has triggered an increase in development of beta-lactamase, which resists antibiotics. However, a 1994 study has identified a large protein on the surface of M. catarrhalis that may serve as a target for protective antibodies. This UspA (the designated antigen) protein is the first surface-exposed protein on M. catarrhalis that can be a target for biologically active antibodies, and therefore lead to a vaccination. This protein was also present in all of the strains tested. The large size of the exposed protein macromolecule makes it similar to Neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein macromolecular complex, which implies that UspA may be a single polypeptide chain. Active immunization, in a study, of M. catarrhalis in the respiratory tract allowed the control of the growth of M. catarrhalis and led to the development of serum antigens. Also, an enhanced ability exists in the test subjects (mice) to clear M. catarrhalis from their lungs. Likewise, passive immunization of M. catarrhalis from the mice respiratory tracts also enhanced the mice's ability to clear the microbes from their lungs, which means that serum antibodies likely play a large role in the immunization and protection of the respiratory tract. Along with outer membrane proteins that are consistent among different strains of M. catarrhalis, a sort of subclass-specific IgG antibody response to certain outer membrane proteins may also exist. Therefore, the outer membrane antigens of M. catarrhalis also provide a possible vaccine source. Also, a bactericidal serum antibody has also been developed in response to the diseases caused by M. catarrhalis. =Treatment= Treatment options include antibiotic therapy or a so-called \\"watchful waiting\\" approach. The great majority of clinical isolates of this organism produce beta-lactamases, so are resistant to penicillin. Resistance to trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP- SMX), clindamycin, and tetracycline have been reported. It is susceptible to fluoroquinolones, most second- and third-generation cephalosporins, erythromycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. =Vaccine development= Currently, no vaccine is known in the US against M. catarrhalis infection. It is a significant cause of respiratory tract infections against which a vaccine is sought. Several outer membrane proteins are currently under investigation as potential vaccine antigens, including the porin M35. Biochemistry During the first reported case of M. catarrhalis causing bacteremia that was associated with septic arthritis, the microbe was cultured, which revealed much about the morphology of its colonies, as well as M. catarrhalis itself. M. catarrhalis is a large, kidney-shaped, Gram-negative diplococcus. It can be cultured on blood and chocolate agar plates after an aerobic incubation at 37 °C for 24 hours. Cultures revealed gray-white hemispheric colonies about 1 mm in diameter. These colonies were fragile and easy to crumble, and appeared to have a waxy surface. The hockey puck test was applied to these M. catarrhalis colonies, in which a wooden stick is used to try to push the colonies across the plate. The M. catarrhalis colonies scored positively on this test, which means they could be slid across the plate. The colonies did not demonstrate hemolysis, and were not able to ferment glucose, sucrose, maltose, or lactose. They were able to produce DNase. Cultures of the M. catarrhalis tested positive for oxidase, lipase, and nitrate reduction, which is characteristic of M. catarrhalis. Many laboratories also perform a butyrate esterase test and a beta-lactamase test. Both tests should be positive and can help to rapidly identify it from a culture.Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 10th edition. James Versalovic, copyright 2012 ASM press. The recognition of M. catarrhalis as a pathogen has led to studies for possible antibodies against it, which have led to a wider understanding of its composition. The outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles of different strains of M. catarrhalis are extremely similar to each other. Analyses of these OMP profiles with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) revealed that a few proteins with similar molecular masses in the different strains have cross-reactive epitopes. Also, a surface-exposed protein on M. catarrhalis has an unusually high molecular mass. An 80-kDa OMP on M. catarrhalis is immunogenic and common to all nonencapsulated strands of M. catarrhalis, which suggests it may be used as an antigen for immunization. = Protein secretion = M. catarrhalis utilizes the twin-arginine translocation pathway (TAT pathway) for the transport of folded proteins across the inner membrane. The translocase apparatus is a typical Gram- negative TAT translocase consisting of three essential membrane proteins: TatA, TatB and TatC. TatA proteins form a pore through which passenger proteins are transported and TatB and TatC proteins recognize, bind and direct the passenger proteins to the membrane spanning TatA pore. The M. catarrhalis TAT translocase protein encoding genes tatA, tatB and tatC are located in a single tatABC locus in the bacterial chromosome and are likely to be transcriptionally and translationally linked due to a single-nucleotide overlap between each gene. Multiple M. catarrhalis proteins have been predicted or tested to contain the highly conserved leader motif for translocation and to be transported by the TAT pathway. Beta-lactamases BRO-1 and BRO-2 have been shown to be transported by the TAT pathway. Other potential passenger proteins include an iron-dependent peroxidase -like protein, a cytochrome c -like protein and a phosphate ABC transporter inner membrane protein- like protein. A functioning TAT pathway is necessary for the optimal growth of M. catarrhalis even in conditions without antibiotics.

She was also a member of the American squad at the 2005 Pan American Games, where she placed first with the team and earned individual silver and bronze medals on the vault and floor exercise. At the 2006 Cottbus Cup, part of the prestigious World Cup circuit, Bieger won gold on vault, silver on beam, and bronze on bars. At the 2006 Pacific Alliance Championships, she won gold in the team, vault, and floor exercise finals. At the National Championships in August, she finished third in the all-around, maintaining her previous year's ranking. She also placed in the top six on all four events, winning a silver medal on the vault and a bronze on beam. In October, Bieger was a member of the silver-medal-winning U.S. team at the World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark. She fell on vault during team finals but earned scores over 15.000 on the other three events, and later won the silver medal in the all-around. This result was controversial, in part because the gold medalist, Vanessa Ferrari of Italy, won despite a fall on the balance beam. Additionally, Ferrari and Bruno Grandi, the president of the International Federation of Gymnastics are both from Italy, which raised questions about the impartiality of the judging. Both gymnastics fans and officials from other countries, including the head of the Romanian team, Nicolae Forminte, publicly objected to the scoring and the final results. USA Gymnastics did not take an official stance. After the all- around, Bieger competed in the floor exercise event final, where she won her third silver medal of the World Championships behind Cheng Fei of China. She also participated in the uneven bars final, replacing her injured teammate Chellsie Memmel, and finished in fifth place. She sustained an ankle injury in early 2007 at the American Cup that took her out of competition for a while. She competed at the 2007 U.S. Nationals despite a lack of training, but did not do well and was not chosen for the World Championships team. She was scheduled to compete at the 2007 Cottbus Cup, but the U.S. national team coordinator, Márta Károlyi, pulled her from the meet, saying she was not prepared for international competition. Bieger returned to international competition in 2008 at a small meet, competing on all events but floor. She went on to compete at the 2008 Pacific Rim Championships, where she won silver in the all-around and gold on the uneven bars. After the 2008 Olympic Trials and selection camp, Bieger was named as an alternate to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Although two gymnasts on the squad were injured, she was not allowed to compete. She expressed disappointment about the experience but continued to compete in 2009, making appearances at the CoverGirl Classic in July and the Visa National Championships in August. She made it to the final round of the team selection camp for the World Championships in October but was not chosen. Instead, she received a berth to the Croatia World Cup in November, alongside teammate Kytra Hunter.

Converted to a destroyer minesweeper in 1940, she served in the Pacific throughout World War II, including during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Guadalcanal campaign, and the New Georgia campaign. Trever was named in memory of Lieutenant Commander George A. Trever. As of 2010, no other U.S. Navy ship has been named Trever. Construction and commissioning Trever was built at the Mare Island Navy Yard in California. She was launched on 15 September 1920, sponsored by Mrs. Bess McMillan Trever (George Trever's widow) and was commissioned on 3 August 1922 with Lieutenant H. E. Snow in command. Service history After shakedown, Trever was decommissioned in January 1923. She was recommissioned on 2 June 1930, operating from San Diego, California, with the Battle Force. She was reclassified as a destroyer minesweeper and redesignated DMS-16 on 19 November 1940, after which she was based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 1941 as part of the Base Force, United States Fleet. World War II =1941= On the morning of 7 December 1941, when Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor, Trever was moored in West Loch at Pearl Harbor with the destroyer minesweepers , , and . She engaged the aircraft with her .50-caliber Browning machine guns, was responsible for shooting one down, and contributed with her sister ships to another plane's demise. She hurriedly sortied, putting to sea under the command of the captain of the destroyer , as many commanding officers were not able to reach their ships before they sortied. Trever's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Dwight Agnew, who had gone to sea on board Wasmuth, was able to rejoin Trever later that day. Trever spent the rest of 1941 and the beginning of 1942 conducting minesweeping operations, local escort missions, and antisubmarine patrols. =1942= On 28 January 1942 Trever was in the Alenuihaha Channel off Maui′s Hana Coast north of ʻUpolu Point, the northernmost point on the island of Hawaii, escorting a two-ship convoy on a voyage from Kahului, Maui, to Hilo, Hawaii, consisting of the 622-ton United States Army Transport and the small cargo ship Kalae with a barge in tow. At dawn, the Japanese submarine I-71 fired two torpedoes at General Royal T. Frank which missed. I-71 then fired a third torpedo that struck the transport, which exploded and sank in less than 30 seconds. Of the 60 people aboard — including 26 United States Army recruits — Kalae rescued 36. I-71 escaped. After escorting a convoy from Honolulu to California, Trever was refitted at Mare Island Navy Yard, with her guns replaced by antiaircraft (AA) guns and 20 mm guns Oerlikon cannons. Trever next saw action in the first U.S. amphibious assault of the war against the Solomon Islands with the aim of securing Guadalcanal. At first she screened transports and then joined the bombardment of a Japanese shore battery on the island of Gavutu; she scored a direct hit and the battery was destroyed. Later she used her antiaircraft guns to drive off Japanese bombers that had attacked transport ships. The following day Trever shot down four twin-engined Mitsubishi G4M (Allied reporting name \\"Betty\\") bombers. On that evening, 9 August, a Japanese cruiser force conducted a surprise attack on the Allied (US and Australian) fleet, resulting in the Battle of Savo Island. The outcome was a very heavy defeat for the Allies, with four heavy cruisers sunk and one severely damaged. However, the Japanese fleet did not press its advantage and the vulnerable transports supporting the invasion escaped unscathed. As a result of the battle, the Allied warships withdrew and the transports, whose withdrawal Trever helped to screen, retreated to New Caledonia. The invasion was subsequently supported by high-speed transport and destroyer minesweepers, including Trever herself. Her first mission was from Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal, loaded with reinforcements and supplies for the hard-pressed U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal. After hastily unloading she retired toward Nouméa, arriving there on 22 September. After escorting a further high-speed convoy to replenish land forces engaged on the Solomons she was deployed to search for survivors of the Battle of Cape Esperance, fought on the night of 12 October 1942. During the day's search, Trever took on board 34 Japanese survivors, including three officers. One raft of eight refused to surrender and put up a fight, giving Trever no recourse but to destroy it and its occupants. Trever then transferred her prisoners to the attack transport and headed back to Espiritu Santo escorting the returning transports. After completing another resupply mission, on 25 October, Trever had been expecting orders to bombard Japanese positions along Guadalcanal's coast. However, an intercepted message informed Lieutenant Commander Agnew of Trever that three Japanese destroyers were approaching, apparently to bombard the airstrip at Henderson Field on Guadlacanal. Two choices were open to Agnew, who was commanding a task unit consisting of Trever and Zane. One was to head for the Maliala River to join the gunboat and the damaged seaplane tender which were both well camouflaged. By following this plan, Zane and Trever, both uncamouflaged, might attract the Japanese into the area and raise a strong possibility of the destruction of all four highly vulnerable American ships. Accordingly, the ships attempted the alternative, a dash for safety. The two old destroyer minesweeepers got underway and accelerated as fast as possible to clear the area. Some 15 minutes later the Japanese destroyers' silhouettes came over the horizon, hull-down and travelling at high speed. The American ships could manage only and the Japanese, making , gained rapidly and opened fire with their guns while still out of range of the Americans' armament. The first enemy shells overshot and sent up fountains of water several hundred yards ahead of the destroyer minesweepers; the next salvo fell some astern. The American ships used evasive action and returned fire from their guns as Japanese salvos exploded in the sea nearby. The Japanese then hit Zane amidships, killing three men. Agnew now decided that his ships' best chance of survival would come from attempting to make a high-speed transit of shoal-studded Niella Channel. Just as the Americans were changing course, the Japanese broke off the action, perhaps remembering their primary mission. After continuing resupply runs through January 1943, Trever steamed to Australia for overhaul, arriving at Sydney on 27 January 1943. =1943= Trever returned to Espiritu Santo on 28 February 1943 before calling at Wellington, New Zealand, on 31 May 1943. Returning to escort duties, she accompanied the tank landing ship from Lungga Roads to the Russell Islands on 20 June 1943. After nightfall, a Japanese twin-float biplane seaplane came over and dropped bombs on the two ships, sending them to general quarters and provoking return fire from Trever′s 20-millimeter guns. Trever next took part in operations in the New Georgia campaign. On the 29 June 1943, Rear Admiral George H. Fort raised his flag on Trever as Commander, Task Group 31.3. That night, in company with the high-speed transports and and seven infantry landing craft (LCIs), Trever departed Wernham Cove in the Russell Islands. At daybreak the next morning, the high-speed transports launched their landing boats. The troops landed at Oliana Bay on New Georgia, taking the Japanese defenders by surprise. Later that day, with the objective secured, Rear Admiral Fort disembarked at Renard Sound ending Trever's brief role as flagship. On 5 July 1943, American forces attacked at Kula Gulf to occupy Rice Anchorage and thus to prevent Japanese reinforcements from reaching Munda, Solomon Islands Munda from Vila. Trever transported infantry and joined bombardment and transport groups in the assault. On 5 August 1943, Trever joined the light cruiser , which had lost her bow to a Japanese Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedo during the Battle of Kolombangara, and escorted her from Espiritu Santo to Pearl Harbor. On 19 August 1943, Trever got underway to escort an eastbound convoy to San Francisco, California. After a month's overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, Trever steamed for Pearl Harbor on 8 October 1943 and touched there briefly before heading for Guadalcanal. On 11 November 1943, she joined the screen for the transport and escorted her to Empress Augusta Bay off Bougainville Island. Later that month, Trever took part in the landings at Cape Torokina on Bougainville, which began the Bougainville campaign. =1944= Trever devoted the next year to escort missions and target towing duty in the South and Central Pacific. Perhaps the highlight of this service came in October 1944 when she joined the screen for the torpedoed light cruiser and heavy cruiser and escorted them safely to Ulithi Atoll. On 18 December 1944, as she was escorting a convoy toward the Western Caroline Islands, Trever was caught in a typhoon. Visibility dropped to zero due to torrential rains, with mountainous waves and winds. At 16:30, a man making emergency repairs topside was washed overboard, and Trever immediately began a search for the missing sailor. Two hours later, she picked up her man: bruised, battered, and in shock — but alive. The following day, Trever put into Guam and transferred her injured sailor to the naval hospital. On 22 December 1944, she reached Eniwetok. On 24 December 1944, she and U.S. Army Transport got underway for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 31 December 1944. Trever reached the Naval Repair Base, San Diego, California, and began overhaul on 9 January 1945. =1945= Upon completion of her repairs, Trever headed for Oahu on 25 March 1945. For the remainder of the war, Trever operated out of Pearl Harbor, where she had entered the hostilities with Japan four years before. On 4 June 1945, she was reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and designated as AG-110. On 22 September 1945, Trever departed Pearl Harbor for the last time and steamed to San Diego. After repairs, she proceeded via the Panama Canal to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 21 October 1945. She was decommissioned on 23 November 1945, struck from the Navy list on 5 December 1945, and sold for scrapping on 12 November 1946.  Honors  Trever received five battle stars for her World War II service.

Arnstadt, a captain of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, was shot and killed by Bundesgrenzschutz officer Hans Plüschke near Wiesenfeld during a shootout that occurred under unknown circumstances. Arnstadt's death caused an escalation of Cold War tensions. In 1998, Hans Plüschke was found murdered near Wiesenfeld under similar circumstances to Arnstadt, leading to conspiracy theories in Germany. Border guard service In June 1949, Arnstadt registered for service with the Volkspolizei, the police force of the Soviet Occupation Zone, becoming an Anwärter der VP (police cadet) with the Kasernierte Volkspolizei in Gotha. In March 1950, Arnstadt was appointed to the German Border Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei) in Dermbach, patrolling the Inner German border with West Germany. In 1952, Arnstadt failed his first attempt to become an officer at the police school in Sondershausen. In 1953, his marriage ended in divorce, with his two children Veronika and Uwe staying with the mother, and remarried shortly after. In 1954, Arnstadt passed his officer training at Sondershausen and was appointed the rank of Unterleutnant, and the following year was promoted to lieutenant. Arnstadt functioned as a recruiter for the German Border Police until 1957 when he was appointed as a company commander of the 6th border company in Dermbach. Arnstadt was responsible for a section of the border at Wiesenfeld, a region of Bezirk Suhl in the Rhön Mountains at the westernmost point of the Warsaw Pact. Arnstadt's section contained the highly- strategic Fulda Gap, which aroused the special interest of NATO, and a short distance from the US Army's Observation Post Alpha. Arnstadt moved with his wife to Wiesenfeld and in April 1957 became an unofficial collaborator (Geheimer Informator) of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) until this relationship was ended fourteen months later. In 1961, the German Border Police was reformed into the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic (Grenztruppen der DDR) and became a service branch of the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA), the armed forces of East Germany. Arnstadt and his wife moved into a new house in Wiesenfeld whose owner had been recently expelled by Aktion Kornblume (Operation Cornflower), a large-scale operation of the East German government to expel \\"politically unreliable\\" people from living near the Inner German border. Additionally, Arnstadt was promoted to captain, received good grades and been awarded several times, including the Medal for Exemplary Border Service. Death Memorial stone for Rudi Arnstadt in Wiesenfeld in September 2013. On the morning of 14 August 1962, Arnstadt was killed by Hans Plüschke, a 23-year-old West German Bundesgrenzschutz border guard, in a shootout next to the border in his section at Wiesenfeld. =Investigation= At approximately 10:30 AM, while supervising the fence construction, Arnstadt and his assistant Karlheinz Roßner broke away from his men to closer inspect the border west of the fence. According to Roßner, they discovered a West German border guard patrolling at the border, who Arnstadt accused of entering East German territory and warned him to leave. A few minutes later, Arnstadt and Roßner spotted three West German border guards approaching, but this time Arnstadt wanted to \\"arrest one of these provocateurs\\" and waited for them to get closer. Arnstadt surprised the West Germans, shouting \\"Stop! Stay up! Hands up!\\" aiming his pistol at them while Roßner issued a warning shot as ordered with his submachine gun at the same time. Reportedly, Plüschke then fired at them, shooting Arnstadt above his right eye and killing him instantly. Plüschke claimed that Arnstadt and Roßner had shot at him and his colleagues first and he returned fire at Arnstadt in self-defence. =Response= Arnstadt's death was the fourth death of an East German border guard to occur within a short period of time, which led to a very strained relationship between the two opposing sets of German border troops. The Cold War tensions between East Germany and West Germany were escalated by his death and resulted in a propaganda war between the two countries. East Germany portrayed Arnstadt as a defender of the territory of the German Democratic Republic, styled as a folk hero and had several public institutions named in his honor. Plüschke was sentenced to 25 years in prison in absentia for his murder by an East German court and his extradition was requested. According to West German officials, Plüschke was returning fire after his patrol was shot at. Hans Plüschke's murder At 4 a.m. on March 15, 1998, the body of 59-year-old Hans Plüschke was found by a motorist on the Bundesstraße B84 between Rasdorf and Hünfeld, from his vehicle.Deutscher Bundestag, 14.

On August 14, 1962, Oberjäger T.P. of the BGS shot and killed DDR Army Hauptmann R.A. when he observed R.A. preparing to fire again at a BGS officer. The border incident occurred at Setzelbach, Hesse. This document can be found on the web at . An article from the Frankfurter Rundschau on August 9, 2002, further reports on this amazing story, identifying the BGS trooper as Hans Plüschke and the DDR border officer as Rudi Arnstadt. Plüschke's 1962 shot struck Arnstadt in the right eye, killing him instantly. On March 15, 1998, Hans Plüschke, who had become a taxi driver, was found murdered on Highway 84 between Rasdorf and Hünfeld, shot in the right eye. German authorities considered the possibility that this was a 36-year-delayed act of revenge by former DDR agents. The article can be viewed on the web at: http://www.stasiopfer.de/component/option,com_simpleboard/Itemid,/func,view/id,1029014251/catid,4/ Plüschke's death prompted a number of conspiracy theories in Germany as he was fatally shot in his right eye, the same wound that had killed Arnstadt almost 36 years earlier, near to Wiesenfeld, and had not been robbed. Plüschke was only revealed to the public as Arnstadt's shooter in 1996, and rumors circulated that he had received death threats. In 1997, Plüschke had appeared in a television interview where he stated it was a \\"strange feeling to be told that you have killed a human being\\" and \\"I have become a victim of the Cold War.\\" Rudi Arnstadt's son Uwe also brought no knowledge, testifying at a hearing that he had no desire for revenge against Plüschke. Police formed a Special Commission to investigate Plüschke's murder, but this was dissolved in the summer due to lack of leads and put on hiatus until any new information was discovered.

Yugra or Iuhra (Old Russian Югра Jugra; Byzantine Greek Οὔγγροι Oὔggroi; Introduction into the Latin epigraphy (Введение в латинскую эпиграфику).) was a collective name for lands and peoples between the Pechora River and Urals (modern north-west Russia), in the Russian annals of the 12th–17th centuries. During this period the region was inhabited by the name of the Khanty (a.k.a. Ostyaks; Hanty) and Mansi (Vogul; Maansi) peoples. Yugra was also the source for the name of the Ugric language family (including both the Khanty and Mansi languages, as well as Hungarian). The modern Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug is also sometimes known as Yugra, and Yugra is a part of its official Russian name. History Yugra (Iuhra), \\"the place of origin of Hungarians\\" (inde ungaroru origo) on Sigismund von Herberstein's 1549 map of Moscovia. Herberstein placed the label Iuhra east of the Ob River, while a statue of Aurea anus (), a.k.a. Slata baba (\\"Golden Idol\\") can be seen west of the Ob. The 12th century missionary and traveller Abu Hamid al-Gharnati gives one of the earliest accounts of the region, which he calls Yura in Arabic: > But beyond Wisu by the Sea of Darkness there lies a land known by the name > of Yura. In summers the days are very long there, so that the Sun does not > set for forty days, as the merchants say; but in winters the nights are > equally long. The merchants report that Darkness is not far (from them), and > that the people of Yura go there and enter it with torches, and find a huge > tree there which is like a big village. But on top of the tree there sits a > large creature, they say it is a bird. And they bring merchandise along, and > each merchant sets down his goods apart from those of the others; and he > makes a mark on them and leaves, but when he comes back, he finds > commodities there, necessary for his own country ... (Al Garnati:32) The Golden Lady of the Obians was apparently an idol of the Yugrans. The first reports of the Golden Lady are found in the 14th-century Novgorod Chronicles, with reference to Saint Stephan of Perm. Next, the golden idol is mentioned in the 16th century by the subjects of the Grand Duke of Moscow, commissioned to describe the trade and military routes of the expanding Russia. The first non- Russian known to have examined the Golden Lady is Maciej Miechowita, a professor at Cracow University. The golden idol appeared on Sigismund von Herberstein's map of Moscovia published in 1549, and on a number of later maps, e.g. Gerhard Mercator's \\"Map of the Arctic (1595)\\", where it is labeled Zolotaia Baba (from Russian Золотая баба – \\"Golden Lady\\" or \\"Golden Idol\\"). In connection with Yermak's campaign, the Siberian Chronicle also mentions the golden woman: a hetman of Yermak's, by the name of Ivan Bryazga, invaded the Belogorye region in 1582 and fought the Ob-Ugrians there, who were defending their holiest object – the golden woman. (See Karjalainen 1918:243–245, Shestalov 1987:347.) And Grigori Novitski's statement that in earlier days there used to be in one shrine in Belogorye together with the copper goose \\"the greatest real idol\\", and that the superstitious people \\"preserved that idol and took it to Konda now that idol-worshipping is being rooted up\\", has also been regarded as relating to the golden woman (Novitski: 61). Of the \\"Copper Goose\\" Novitski wrote the following: > The goose idol very much worshipped by them is cast of copper in the shape > of a goose, its atrocious abode is in the Belogorye village on the great > river of Ob. According to their superstition they worship the god of > waterfowls – swans, geese and other birds swimming on water ... His throne > in the temple is made of different kinds of broadcloth, canvas and hide, > built like a nest; in it sits the monster who is always highly revered, most > of all at the times of catching waterfowls in nests ... This idol is so > notorious that people come from distant villages to perform atrocious > sacrifice to it – offering cattle, mainly horses; and they are certain that > it (the idol) is the bearer of many goods, mainly ensuring the richness of > waterfowls ... Comparisons of different Yugran traditions indicate that the goose was one of the shapes or appearances of the most popular god of the \\"World Surveyor Man\\", and that Belogorye is still sometimes referred to as his home. Novitsky also describes a site for worshipping this \\"World Surveyor\\" or \\"Ob Master\\": Modern history The Christianization of the Mansi en masse started at the beginning of the 18th century. Grigory Novitsky describes the Christianization of the Pelym Mansi in 1714 and the Konda Mansi in 1715. The words of the village elder and the caretaker of the sanctuary Nahratch Yeplayev have been recorded: Novitsky describes the above-mentioned idol as follows: It seems that a compromise was reached whereby the idols would be saved – for now at least – and at last Nahratsh who had consulted the elders of the village proposed a compromise: This arrangement seems to have lasted for a while, but later it is recorded that this agreement was broken and the totems and idols so sacred to the Mansi and Khanty were burned by Russian Christian zealots. Many of these totems were not destroyed, but hidden, their locations kept secret over the generations. Even during repression of the 1930s many of these sacred sites remained undiscovered by the authorities and some can be found today. Yugrian Principalities and relations with the Tatars and Russians The coat of arms of Kondia. There are three or four known proto-states of the Yugran inhabitants, both Khanty and Mansi. The Principality of Pelym was located in the basin of the Konda river and stretched from the mouth of the Sosva River near Tavda up to Tabory. The stronghold of the Pelym princes was also a significant religious centre; a sacred Siberian larch grew in its surroundings and even in the 18th century people used to hang the skins of sacrificed horses on its branches. Near the sacred tree was a worship storehouse with five idols of human figure, and smaller storehouses with high pillars and human-faced peaks around it for storing sacrificial instruments. The bones of sacrificial animals were stored in a separate building (Novitski: 81). The Principality of Konda (mainly Mansi) formed a large semi autonomous part of the Pelym principality, according to the tax registers from 1628/29 it was inhabited by 257 tax-paying Mansi. The treasures of Prince Agai of Konda who was imprisoned by the Russians in 1594 gives us a good picture of the wealth of the Yugran nobles of this period. Namely, the Russians confiscated two silver crowns, a silver spoon, a silver beaker, a silver spiral bracelet, \\"precious drapery\\" and numerous pelts and precious furs (Bahrushin 1955,2:146). The third part of the Pelym principality was the region of Tabary, in which inhabited 102 adults in 1628/29. Preceding the coming of the Russians the Mansi of this region were farmers and according to the tradition Yermak collected tribute in the form of grain (Bahrushin 1955, 2:147). It is believed the Yugran people or Ob-Ugrians had made trade with many countries far and wide since the earliest times. This trade was described in journals attributed to Abu Hamid al-Gharnati the Arab traveller during the 12th century: According to some sources, Novgorod launched military campaigns against the Yugrans \\"living with the Samoyeds in the Land of Midnight\\" already at the end of the first millennium (Bahrushin 1955,1:86). At that time, the Russians probably came into contact with the Mansi who were still living in Europe, along the upper course of the river Pechora, in the neighbourhood of the ancient Komi realm of Great Perm. The Novgorod Chronicle tells of a military campaign under the leadership of Yadrei of Novgorod in 1193, which ended in the destruction of the Novgorod forces. The defeat was blamed on some Novgorodans who had reportedly \\"been in contact with the Yugrans\\" (Bahrushin 1955,1:75). From the 13th to 15th centuries, Yugra was supposed to pay tribute to Novgorod. But taxes could be collected only by means of armed forces. The chronicles describe several campaigns, mentioning the strong resistance of Yugran princes who took shelter in their strongholds. After the annexation of Ustyug by Moscow in the 14th century, Muscovite campaigns began instead of the Novgorodan ones. In the 15th century, the most important Russian stronghold in Permland and the starting point for all expeditions going to the East was the diocese established on the Vym River by Stephan of Perm. In 1455,the Mansi of Pelym launched a campaign under the command of Prince Asyka. Moscow reciprocated by forming an alliance with Prince Vasily of Great Perm who together with the warriors of Vym who took part in the 1465 expedition to Yugra (Bahrushin 1955,1:76). It is recorded in the Russian Chronicles that, in 1465, as a result of this raid, two minor \\"Yugrian\\" princes (Kalpik and Chepik) were compelled to submit to the Russians and pay tribute. They were soon deposed. In 1467, during a second campaign, Prince Asyka himself was captured and brought to Vyatka (Bahrushin 1955,2:113). In 1483, Moscow sent forth another expedition against the princes of Yugra and Konda where the \\"grand duke\\" Moldan was captured (Bahrushin 1955,2:113). In 1499, Moscow dispatched a great force against \\"Yugra\\" (Pelym; led by Prince Semyon Kurbski), Konda or Koda (led by Prince Pyotr Ushatyi), and the \\"Gogulichi\\", the free Voguls or Mansi). The 4000 strong army, using dog and reindeer teams, reached the Lyapin stronghold of the Khanty, located on the river of the same name (Bahrushin 1955,1:76–77). In the source it is told that 40 strongholds were taken and 58 Khanty and Mansi princes captured in the expedition. At the end of the 15th century the Grand Duke of Moscow assumed the honorary title of Prince of Yugra. By the 16th century, several Yugran princes were paying tribute to the Siberia Khanate and participated in their military ventures against Russian settlers protected by Cossacks and Komi auxiliaries who were chasing the Yugran natives from their homes. In response the Khanty and Mansi of Pelym continually sent forth counter-campaigns to the lands of Great Perm. Thus, the year 1581 went into history as the year of the raiding of Kaigorod and Cherdyn. According to Russian estimates, the army of the Mansi and their allies, the Tartars, stood 700 strong (Bahrushin 1955,1:99; 2:144). Continuing resistance to border conflagration led to the launching of a campaign in 1582–84 arranged and financed by the Stroganovs and led by the Cossack leader Yermak Timofeyevich, which began with the destruction of a Mansi war band that had invaded the Russian settlers territory and ended as a punitive expedition against the Pelym Mansi and their ally the Siberian Khan. In some sources, Alach, Prince of Koda figures as an important ally of the Siberian Khan Kuchum Khan and is said to have been awarded one of the Yermak mail-coats taken from the enemy (Bahrushin 1955, 1:114). In 1592, another Russian campaign against the Mansi of Pelym was launched. It ended in 1593 when the stronghold of Prince Ablegirim of Pelym was taken, the prince and his family captured and a Russian fortress erected in the heart of the stronghold. Although in the following year the Pelym principality suffered the loss of its lands lying on the Konda River, the Mansi did not give up resistance. In 1599, they once again brought \\"war, theft and treachery\\" to the banks of the Chusovaya River and Kurya River and plundered the Russian settlements there (Bahrushin,2:143–144). The close connections between the Yugrans and the Turkic Tartars are also demonstrated by the fact that even in the 1660s, the idea of restoring the Kuchum Khanate was still popular with the Khanty of Beryozovo (Bahrushin,2:143–144). It was only in the middle of the 17th century that Moscow succeeded in subduing Yugra. In the 18th century, the successors of the Principality of Pelym and Principality of Konda – princes Vassili and Fyodor – lived in Pelym. They became Russianized and performed various duties for the Tsarist government. The Mansi, however, considered them still as their rulers. The fact that the ancient family of princes ruled on in Konda is also proved by a tsar letter from 1624: Prince Kyntsha of Konda received a deed of gift from the Tsar in 1680 which confirmed his noble position. Even in the 18th century the Konda princes were known for their relative independence. It is assumed that, as late as 1715, Prince Satyga of Konda and his 600 armed men made an attempt to impede the Christianisation of the Konda Mansi (Novitski: 98). From 1732–47, Konda was ruled by Satyga's son Prince Osip Grigoryev, followed by his own son Prince Vlas Ossipov. According to recent research by Aado Lintrop, one of the great-grandchildren of Satyga, the teacher of the Turinsky community school, Aleksander Satygin claimed the title \\"Prince of Konda\\" as late as 1842.  Hungarian Urheimat Migration of the Hungarians from Russia Yugra and its vicinity to the south are considered to be the place of origin of the Hungarians (in Hungarian magyar őshaza). One hypothesis says that the name Hungary is a variety of the name Yugra (the Hungarians also were known in several languages under the name of Ugri, and are still known under this name in Ukrainian). The Hungarian language is also the closest linguistic relative of Khanty and Mansi. It is believed that Hungarians moved West from Yugra, first settling on the western side of the Urals, in the region known as Magna Hungaria (Great Yugria). Then they moved to the region of Levédia (present-day east Ukraine), then to the region of Etelköz (present-day west Ukraine), finally reaching the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century.

It is native to much of west central and east Africa, including Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Chad. The species consists of several subspecies that differ in appearance. It has a distinctive appearance, which is alluded to in its name; the long white fringes of hair that run along each side of its black trunk are known as a mantle. Its face is framed with white hair and it has a large white tail tuft. The mantled guereza is diurnal and arboreal, found in both deciduous and evergreen forests. It is an adaptable species that can cope with habitat disturbance and prefers secondary forest close to rivers or lakes. Although previously thought only to eat leaves, it also eats seeds, fruits, and arthropods. It is able to digest plant material with a high fibre content with its specialised stomach and may only eat from a few plant species at a time. It is preyed on by birds of prey and some mammals, such as the common chimpanzee and the leopard. The mantled guereza lives in social groups of three to fifteen individuals. These groups normally include a dominant male, several females, and the offspring of the females. It has a polygynous mating system and copulation is initiated with vocal communication. After a gestation period of just over five months, infants are born with pink skin and white fur, which darkens to the adult coloration by three to four months. The mantled guereza is well known for its dawn chorus, the males' \\"roar\\" is a method of long distance communication that reinforces territorial boundaries. It also makes other vocalization and uses body postures, movements, and facial expressions to communicate. The mantled guereza is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because it is widespread – although it is locally threatened in some areas, the decline is not great enough to list it in a higher category of threat. However, one subspecies found in Kenya is listed as Endangered. It can survive well in degraded forests and in some areas it is more common in logged areas than unlogged ones. The mantled guereza is also threatened by hunting for bushmeat and for its skin. Etymology The mantled guereza has many alternative common names including the guereza, the eastern black-and- white colobus, the magistrate colobus, or the Abyssinian black-and-white colobus. The name \\"mantled\\" refers to its mantle, the long silky white fringes of hair that run along its body and \\"guereza\\" is the native name of the monkey in Ethiopia. The scientific name Colobus derives from Greek kolobus meaning \\"mutilated\\" which refers to its lack of thumbs. Taxonomic classification The mantled guereza was first classified by Eduard Rüppell, a German naturalist and explorer, during his trip to Abyssinia between 1830 and 1834. He wrote about the species in Neue Wirbelthiere con Abyssinien, Saengthiere in 1835. It was first seen in Europe in 1890 in Berlin Zoological Garden when three individuals were purchased from a dealer from Massawa, Eritrea. Distribution map of subspecies of Mantled guereza The mantled guereza is in the Colobinae subfamily, also known as the leaf-eating monkeys, a group of Old World monkeys from Asia and Africa. This subfamily is split into three groups, the colobus monkeys of Africa, of which the mantled guereza is a part, the langurs, or leaf monkeys, of Asia, and an \\"odd-nosed\\" group. The African colobus monkeys are divided again by distinctions in color, behavior, and ecology. The three genera are the black-and-white colobi, the red colobi, and the olive colobi. There are three black-and-white colobi: the mantled guereza, Colobus guereza, the king colobus, C. polykomos, and the Angola colobus, C. angolensis. Groves lists seven subspecies of mantled guereza in Mammal Species of the World (MSW) (2005). The validity of the Djaffa Mountain guereza, C. g. gallarum, is uncertain, although not listed by Groves in MSW, it is recognised in his 2007 Colobinae review paper, and by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessors Gippolliti and Butynski in 2008. *Western guereza, Colobus guereza occidentalis, occurs from eastern Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon at the edge of its western range to South Sudan and Uganda, west of the Nile. *Omo River guereza or Abyssinian black-and-white colobus, C. g. guereza, found in Ethiopia, in the highlands west of the Rift Valley down to the reaches of the Awash River, the Omo River, and in the Blue Nile gorge. *Djaffa Mountains guereza or Neumann's black-and-white colobus, C. g. gallarum, found in the Ethiopian Highlands east of the Rift Valley. *Dodinga Hills guereza, C. g. dodingae, found in the Didinga Hills in South Sudan. *Mau Forest guereza, C. g. matschiei, occurs from western Kenya and Uganda south into northern Tanzania. *Mt Uaraguess guereza or Percival's black-and-white colobus, C. g. percivali, found in the Matthews Range in Kenya. *Eastern black-and-white colobus, C. g. kikuyuensis, occurs in Kenya on the Ngong Escarpment of Mount Kenya and in the Aberdare Range. *Kilimanjaro guereza, C. g. caudatus, found in Tanzania and Kenya in the forests surrounding Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru. The morphological difference between subspecies is most pronounced between the southeastern Kilimanjaro guereza, C. g. caudatus, and the northwestern western guereza, C. g. occidentalis. The intermediate subspecies show a gradual change between the two.

The bands that make up the mantle start at the shoulders and extend along the back until they connect at the lower torso. The tail is long and ends in a white tuft which varies in how much it covers the tail. These features vary in color among subspecies, for example the tail of C. g. guereza is gray until the white tail tuft which covers half of its length, while the tail tuft of C. g. caudatus makes up 80% of the tail. The mantle color ranges from white to cream or yellow. Its face is framed by white hair and it has bushy cheek hairs. The thigh has a white stripe. Infants are born with pink skin and white hair. The hair and skin darken as they age and by three to four months they attain adult coloration. Male usually gain their coloration before females. The male typically weighs and the female weighs between . The head and body length averages for males and for females. Like most colobi, the mantled guereza has a small thumb that is vestigial. There is dentition sexual dimorphism among the subspecies. In some, the males have larger teeth than females, in others the reverse is true, and some have no significant difference. Distribution and habitat thumbrightMantled guerezas are arboreal and prefer secondary forests. The mantled guereza is distributed throughout Equatorial Africa. It ranges from Nigeria and Cameroon in the west to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and northern Tanzania in the east. The mantled guereza lives in both deciduous and evergreen forests. It mainly inhabits forest and savannah woodlands and often extend into highland and montane forests.\\"The natural history of African colobines\\", pp. 75–128 in Davies and Oates It can be found in other forest habitats, both primary and secondary, such as riparian (near fresh or brackish water), gallery, and upland forests. It is particularly common in forests close to rivers and lakes and at high elevations. It can be found in elevations as high as . This species prefers secondary forests and selects them over old-growth forests if given the choice. It is likely that the mantled guereza prefers these forests due to the increased number of food trees and the weaker chemical defenses of the species within. The mantled guereza is sometimes found in swamps as well as human-made habitats such as Eucalyptus plantations, which may be frequented when the monkey has nutritional deficiencies. Ecology The mantled guereza is primarily arboreal, but does sometimes descend on the ground to forage and travel, perhaps more so than most other colobines. It is diurnal and rests for up to half the day. Foraging or travelling are the next most common activity. Sometime after dawn, mantled guereza groups leave their sleeping trees and will return to them at dusk. During the day, the mantled guereza has long rest periods in between periods of moving and feeding. Other activities, including grooming, greeting, playing and being vigilant, are performed to a lesser extent. The diet of the mantled guereza is predominantly leaves, often of only a few tree species. Despite its reputation as an exclusive leaf-eater, the mantled guereza is not an obligate folivore. While it mainly eats leaves and fruit, its diet is quite variable. It may eat bark, wood, seeds, flowers, petioles, lianas, aquatic-plants, arthropods, soil, and even concrete from buildings. The amount of each food item in its diet varies by area and time of year. Nutritional factors like protein, tannins, and sodium levels in leaves influence its food choices. It may even intermittently travel longer distances to access plants with higher levels of nutrition. Leaves usually make up over half of its diet, although fruits are occasionally eaten more depending on the season. When foraging for leaves, the mantled guereza prefers young ones over old. With fleshy fruits, the mantled guereza prefers to eat them unripe, which may serve to reduce competition with primates that eat ripe fruits. It consumes a number of plant species but only some make up most of its diet at a specific site. Like all colobi, the mantled guereza is able to digest leaves and other plant fibers with a large, multi-chambered stomach that contains bacteria in certain areas.\\"The diversity of living colobines\\", pp. 45–73 in Davies and Oates Like most colobines, it prefers foods with high fiber content that can be easily extracted with its specialized stomach. The mantled guereza is mostly preyed on by the crowned hawk-eagle, but it is also eaten by other birds of prey such as Verreaux's eagle. The common chimpanzee is known to hunt the guereza. The leopard is another possible predator. Behaviour =Social structure= Social grooming or allogrooming mainly occurs between females and is an important social interaction in mantled guereza groups. The mantled guereza lives in stable social groups usually containing three to fifteen members. The groups usually contain one male, several females and juveniles. In some populations, groups containing several males are common. In multi-male groups, males tend to be aggressive with one another with one being dominant. Some males may be expelled from these groups. Multi-male groups may contain father-son pairs or unrelated males. Males that are not part of groups either live solitarily or with other outside males in bachelor groups. The females keep the groups cohesive and they are matrilineally related. They rarely disperse from their natal groups, except possibly when they break apart. Males on the other hand, usually leave when they become subadults or adults. They may start out being solitary and or in bachelor groups. They gain entry into a social group either by being on the periphery or displacing a group male. Because of its low quality diet and the dispersed distribution of its food, the mantled guereza has a resident-egalitarian social structure. Female guerezas living in a group often have an egalitarian dominance style with no formalized rank relations. Relationships are relaxed and friendly with rare signals of dominance or subordinance. Physical aggression within the group is usually not harmful and rarely escalates into a conflict. Allogrooming is an important part of mantled guereza interactions and mostly occurs between females. The adult males rarely groom in the groups. While not strictly territorial, mantled guereza groups can be aggressive towards each other. In some populations, groups may defend core areas (which exist as a small part of the home range), resources, and mates. During intergroup encounters, males can engage in direct or indirect mate defense, like defending a female's resources. It is the males that participate in agonistic inter-group encounters but female may do so as well. Aggressive encounters between groups usually involve chases, displays and vocalizations rather than physical contact. =Reproduction and parenting= Infants are born with white fur and are always carried during the first months of their life. The mantled guereza has a polygynous harem-based mating system. Mating solicitations are made by both males and females, half of the time for each. To solicit mating, the mantled guereza will walk near its potential partner and make low-intensity mouth clicks or tough-smacks. During copulation, the males hold on the female's ankles and body.Harris, T. R. (2005). Roaring, intergroup aggression, and feeding competition in black and white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) at Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Ph.D. thesis. Yale University. Most matings take place between individuals of the same group but copulations outside of the group have been recorded. In multi-male groups, more than one male may mate with the females. The gestation period lasts 158 days with a 16–22 month interbirth interval. The newborn guereza relies on its mother for support and must cling to her. As they grow older, infants can move on their own but keep returning to their mothers. The infants take up most of the attention in the groups. The other females in a group may handle an infant although the latter are only comfortable with their mothers. The males normally don't pay much attention to infants until they are four to five weeks old. Infants can eat solid food at about eight to nine weeks and by fifty weeks they are fully weaned and no longer need to hold on to their mothers. =Communication= The most notable vocalization of the mantled guereza is the \\"roar\\", which is made mainly at night or dawn by males. The sound of a roar can be carried for up to a mile. It is normally the dominant male who roars when there are multiple males in the group. Roars are used for long distance communication and can regulate inter-group spacing without direct, physical contact while foraging. When one male starts roaring, neighboring males will start to roar as well. Often, the mantled guereza will respond to calls regardless of \\"caller identity,\\" focusing more on the collective vocal displays and not the familiarity of the caller. There is variation in the roars of males which could signal the status of their group and fighting ability. With a roar, a male can advertise his body size; both actual and exaggerated. Other vocalizations are made as well. Males may snort, possibly as an alarm call. \\"Purrs\\" are made before group movements. Females and infants may \\"caw\\" when under mild distress. When in more serious distress, like if an infant is in danger, females and sub-adults will squeak or scream. \\"Tongue- clicking\\" is made during mild aggression. In addition to vocalizations, the mantled guereza communicates with several different body postures and movements, displaying of fringe fur, facial expressions, and touches. Conservation status The mantled guereza is hunted for its skin and meat. Because it can live in both dry and gallery forests and move on the ground, the mantled guereza is less threatened than many other colobine species.\\"Conclusions: the past, present and future of the colobines\\", pp. 347–358 in Davies and Oates The IUCN lists it as Least Concern because \\"although locally threatened in parts of its range, this widespread species is not thought to be declining fast enough to place it in a higher category of threat.\\" However, some of the subspecies are classified under different categories. The Mt Uaraguess guereza, C. g. percivali, is listed as Endangered due to its small range and its risk from hunting, while the Dodinga Hills guereza, C. g. dodingae, the Djaffa Mountains guereza, C. g. gallarum, and the Mau Forest guereza, C. g. matschiei are all listed as Data Deficient. The Dodinga Hills guereza hasn't been recorded since the 1960s. Unlike most other primate species, the mantled guereza can survive habitat degradation and can even thrive in degraded forests. Sometimes, logging may increase the number of preferred food trees for the mantled guereza and it is more abundant in logged areas than unlogged ones. However, complete forest clearance causes dramatic declines in numbers. In Uganda complete forest clearings caused a decline of 50% over eight years. The mantled guereza is also threatened by hunting for meat and its skin. Mantled guereza meat sells as bushmeat for $4–9 US. The skins have been sold for fashion or in the tourist trade.

Carbapenems are a class of highly effective antibiotic agents commonly used for the treatment of severe or high- risk bacterial infections. This class of antibiotics is usually reserved for known or suspected multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. Similar to penicillins and cephalosporins, carbapenems are members of the beta lactam class of antibiotics, which kill bacteria by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, thus inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. However, these agents individually exhibit a broader spectrum of activity compared to most cephalosporins and penicillins. Furthermore, carbapenems are typically unaffected by emerging antibiotic resistance, even to other beta-lactams. Carbapenem antibiotics were originally developed at Merck & Co. from the carbapenem thienamycin, a naturally derived product of Streptomyces cattleya. Concern has arisen in recent years over increasing rates of resistance to carbapenems, as there are few therapeutic options for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria (such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and other carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae). Medical uses =Intra- abdominal infections= The carbapenem ertapenem is one of several first-line agents recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for the empiric treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to- moderate severity. Agents with anti-pseudomonal activity, including doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem are not recommended in this population. Doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem are recommended for high-risk community-acquired abdominal infections and for abdominal infections that are hospital-acquired. =Complicated urinary tract infections= A 2015 systematic review found little evidence that would support the identification of a best antimicrobial regimen for complicated urinary tract infections, but identified three high- quality trials supporting high cure rates with doripenem, including in patients with levofloxacin-resistant E. coli infections. =Pneumonia= The carbapenems imipenem and meropenem are recommended by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America as one of several first- line therapy options for people with late-onset hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, especially when Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, or extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae are suspected pathogens. Combination therapy, typically with an aminoglycoside, is recommended for Pseudomonas infections to avoid resistance development during treatment. Carbapenems are less commonly used in the treatment of community- acquired pneumonia, as community-acquired strains of the most common responsible pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenazae, atypical bacteria, and Enterobactericeace) are typically susceptible to narrower spectrum and/or orally administered agents such as fluoroquinolones, amoxicillin, or azithromycin. Imipenem and meropenem are useful in cases in which P. aeruginosa is a suspected pathogen. =Bloodstream Infections= A 2015 meta analysis concluded that the anti-pseudomonal penicillin-beta lactamase inhibitor combination piperacillin-tazobactam gives results equivalent to treatment with a carbapenem in patients with sepsis. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended piperacillin-tazobactam as first line therapy for the treatment of bloodstream infections in neutropenic cancer patients. For bloodstream infections known to be due to extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceace, carbapenems are superior to alternative treatments. =Spectrum of activity= Carbapenems exhibit broad spectrum activity against gram-negative bacteria and somewhat narrower activity against gram-positive bacteria. For empiric therapy (treatment of infections prior to identification of the responsible pathogen) they are often combined with a second drug having broader spectrum gram- positive activity. Gram-negative pathogens The spectrum of activity of the carbapenems imipenem, doripenem, and meropenem includes most Enterobacteriaceace species, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens. Activity is maintained against most strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that are resistant to cephalosporins due to the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Imipenem, doripenem, and meropenem also exhibit good activity against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. The observed activity against these pathogens is especially valued as they are intrinsically resistant to many other antibiotic classes. Gram-positive pathogens The spectrum of activity of the carbapenems against gram-positive bacteria is fairly broad, but not as exceptionally so as in the case of gram-negative bacteria. Good activity is seen against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus species, but many other antibiotics provide coverage for such infections. Good activity is also observed for most Streptococcus species, including penicillin-resistant strains. Carbapenems are not highly active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or most enterococcal infections because carbapenems do not bind to the penicillin-binding protein used by these pathogens. Other Carbapenems generally exhibit good activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. Like other beta lactam antibiotics, they lack activity against atypical bacteria, which do not have a cell wall and are thus not affected by cell wall synthesis inhibitors. Contraindications Carbapenems are contraindicated in patients with prior allergic reactions to beta lactam antibiotics. In addition, as the intramuscular formulations of ertapenem and imipenem are formulated with lidocaine, the intramuscular formulation of these two drugs are contraindicated in patients with prior adverse reactions to lidocaine.M Furthermore, carbapenems are also contraindicated in patients who are taking valproic acid for seizures, as it has been shown to decrease valproic acid concentrations by as much as 90%. Adverse effects Serious and occasionally fatal allergic reactions can occur in people treated with carbapenems. Seizures are a dose-limiting toxicity for both imipenem and meropenem. Clostridium difficile-related diarrhea may occur in people treated with carbapenems or other broad spectrum antibiotics. Those with an allergy to penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to carbapenems. Examples =Approved for clinical use= * Imipenem, the first clinically used carbapenem, was developed at Merck and Co. It was approved for use in the United States in 1985.PRIMAXIN (Brand Name Drug) FDA Application No. (NDA) 050587 Drug Details, Drugs@FDA Imipenem is hydrolyzed in the mammalian kidney by a dehydropeptidase enzyme to a nephrotoxic intermediate, and thus is co-formulated with the dehydropeptidase inhibitor cilastatin. Imipenem is available in both intravenous and intramuscular formulations. * Meropenem is stable to mammalian dehydropeptidases and does not require co-administration of cilastatin. It was approved for use in the United States in 1996. In most indications it is somewhat more convenient to administer than imipenem, 3 times a day rather than 4. Doses of less than one gram may be administered as an IV bolus, whereas imipenem is usually administered as a 20-minute to one hour infusion. Meropenem is somewhat less potent than imipenem against gram-positive pathogens, and somewhat more potent against gram-negative infections. Unlike imipenem, which produced an unacceptable rate of seizures in a phase 2 trial, meropenem is effective for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. A systematic review performed by an employee of the company that markets meropenem concluded that it provides a higher bacterial response and lower adverse event rates than imipenem in people with severe infections, but no difference in mortality rate. * Ertapenem is administered once daily as an intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection. It lacks useful activity against the P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species, both of which are important causes of hospital-acquired infections. * Doripenem has a spectrum of activity very similar to that of meropenem. Its greater stability in solution allows the use of prolonged infusions and it is somewhat less likely to produce seizures than other carbapenems. * Panipenem/betamipron (Japanese approval 1993) * Biapenem (Japanese approval 2001) exhibits similar efficacy and adverse event rates as other carbapenems. * Tebipenem (Japanese approval 2015) is the first carbapenem whose prodrug form, the pivalyl ester, is orally available. =Unapproved/experimental= *Razupenem (PZ-601) **PZ-601 is a carbapenem antibiotic currently being tested as having a broad spectrum of activity including strains resistant to other carbapenems. Despite early Phase II promise, Novartis (who acquired PZ-601 in a merger deal with Protez Pharmaceuticals) recently dropped PZ-601, citing a high rate of adverse events in testing. *Lenapenem *Tomopenem *Thienamycin (thienpenem) the first discovered carbapenem Bacterial resistance =Enterobacteriaceae= Enterobacteriaceae are common pathogens responsible for urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Beta lactam resistance in these pathogens is most commonly due to the expression of beta lactamase enzymes. Between 2007 and 2011, the percentage of Escherichia coli isolates from Canadian hospitals that produce extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) increased from 3.4% to 4.1%; among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates ESBL producers increased from 1.5% to 4.0%. These strains are resistant to third generation cephalosporins that were developed for the treatment of beta lactamase-producing ‘’Enterobacteriaceae’’ and carbapenems are generally regarded as the treatment of choice. More recently, many countries have experienced a dramatic upswing in the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae that produce both ESBLs and carbapenemases such as the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). As of 2013, 70% of Greek Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates are resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 60% are resistant to carbapenems. The growing prevalence and difficulty of treating such multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae has led to a renaissance of the use of antibiotics such as colistin, which was discovered in the 1950s but rarely used until recently due to unattractive levels of toxicity. Prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in paediatric intensive care units (Cairo, Egypt) was 24% and various genes of carbapenemases were detected in 80% of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae with dominance of blaOXA-48. =Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii= Infections caused by the non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanni are most commonly encountered in hospitalized people. These bacteria exhibit an unusually high level of intrinsic resistance to antibiotics due to their expression of a wide range of resistance mechanisms. Antibiotics cross the outer membrane of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter approximately 100 times more slowly than they cross the outer membrane of Enterobacteriaceae, due in part to their use of porins that can adopt a conformation having a very restricted entry channel. Further, the porin levels may be down-regulated in response to antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic molecules that successfully traverse the porin channels may be removed by efflux pumps. Downregulation of the porin OprD2 is an important contributor to imipenem resistance. Like the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter can express a wide range of antibiotic-deactivitating enzymes, including beta lactamases. Pseudomonas produces an inducible broad spectrum beta lactamase, AmpC, that is produced in response to beta lactam exposure. The combination of inducible AmpC expression, poor membrane permeability, and efflux pumps make Pseudomonas resistant to most beta lactams. The clinical efficacy of carbapenems in Pseudomonas infection arises in part because, while they are strong inducers of AmpC, they are poor substrates. The identification of Pseudomonas strains that produce beta lactamases capable of cleaving carbapenems, such as the New Delhi metallo beta lactamase has raised increasing concern regarding the potential for an era of untreatable Pseudomonas infections. Structure In terms of structure, the carbapenems are very similar to the penicillins (penams), but the sulfur atom in position 1 of the structure has been replaced with a carbon atom, and an unsaturation has been introduced--hence the name of the group, the carbapen _e_ ms. Biosynthesis The carbapenems are thought to share their early biosynthetic steps in which the core ring system is formed. Malonyl-CoA is condensed with glutamate-5-semialdehyde with concurrent formation of the five-membered ring. Next, a β-lactam synthetase uses ATP to form the β-lactam and the saturated carbapenam core. Further oxidation and ring inversion provides the basic carbapenem . Administration Due to their expanded spectra, the desire to avoid generation of resistance and the fact that, in general, they have poor oral bioavailability, they are administered intravenously in hospital settings for more serious infections. However, research is underway to develop an effective oral carbapenem. See also *Faropenem is closely related, but it is a penem, not a carbapenem. *Antimicrobial resistance **NDM-1 is an enzyme that introduces bacterial resistance to carbapenem antibiotics via hydrolysis of the carbapenem backbone, thereby inactivating its ability to inhibit cell wall synthesis.

South Carolina's seal is made up of two elliptical areas, linked by branches of the palmetto tree. The image on the left is dominated by a tall palmetto tree and an oak tree, fallen and broken. This scene represents the battle fought on June 28, 1776, between defenders of the unfinished fort on Sullivan's Island, and the British Fleet. The standing palmetto represents the victorious defenders, and the fallen oak is the British Fleet. Banded together on the palmetto with the motto Quis separabit? ('Who will separate [us]?'), are 12 spears that represent the other original 12 states of the Union. Beneath that is enscrolled another of the alternate state mottoes, \\"Meliorem Lapsa Locavit\\" (\\"Having Fallen, She Has Set Up a Better One\\") with the date of 1776. Surrounding the image, at the top, is \\"South Carolina\\", and below, is Animis opibusque parati ('Prepared in mind and resources'). The other image on the seal depicts the Roman goddess Spes walking along a shore that is littered with weapons. The goddess grasps a branch of laurel as the sun rises behind her. Below her image is her name, Spes, Latin for 'hope', and over the image is the motto Dum spiro spero, meaning 'While I breathe, I hope'.

It was developed and operated for experimental purposes, specifically to validate the multiple reentry technologies integrated upon it and the vehicle's overall design, as well as to gain greater insight into the various phenomenon encountered during reentry. The ARD only performed a single spaceflight. On 21 October 1998, the vehicle was launched upon the third flight of the Ariane 5 expendable launch system. Reaching a recorded altitude of 830 km, the ARD performed a guided reentry back to Earth before splashing down relatively close to its intended target point in the Pacific Ocean after one hour and 41 minutes of flight. Following its recovery and subsequent analysis, the vehicle was found to have performed well, the nose cone and heat shield thermal protection having remaining in an ideal state and having remained completely airtight and perfectly intact. The ARD held the distinction of being the first guided sub-orbital reentry vehicle to be manufactured, launched and recovered by Europe.Tran, Phillipe., J.C. Paulat and P. Boukhobza. \\"Re-entry Flight Experiments Lessons Learned – The Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator ARD.\\" EADS Space Transportation, 1 June 2007. OMB No. 0704-0188. One of the core purposes of the mission was the gathering of knowledge that could be subsequently used during the development of future re-entry vehicles and precise landing capabilities. ARD was followed by ARES, flown once in 2009. In the aftermath of the programme, the ESA decided to embark on a follow-up reentry demonstrator, known as the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IVX). The first IXV vehicle underwent its first successful test flight during February 2015. The ARD, ARES and IVX demonstrators are intended to serve as developmental stepping stones towards a vehicle called Space Rider, meant to be the first of a series of production- standard spaceplanes. Development From the 1980s onwards, there was growing international interest in the development of reusable spacecraft; at this time, only the superpowers of the era, the Soviet Union and the United States, had developed this capability. European nations such as Britain and France embarked on their own national programmes to produce spaceplanes, such as HOTOL and Hermes, while attempting to attract the backing of the multinational European Space Agency (ESA). While these programmes ultimately did not garner enough support to continue development, there was still demand within a number of the ESA's member states to pursue the development of reusable space vehicles. Accordingly, shortly after the abandonment of the Hermes programme, it was decided to conduct a technology demonstrator programme with the aim of producing a vehicle which would support the development of subsequent reusable spacecraft. The ESA later referred to this programme, which became known as the Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator (ARD), as being: \\"major step towards developing and operating space transportation vehicles that can return to Earth... For the first time, Europe will fly a complete space mission – launching a vehicle into space and recovering it safely.\\" The ARD was developed and operated as a cooperative civilian space programme under the oversight of the ESA; it fell within the agency's Manned Space Transportation Program (MSTP) framework. Under this framework, the programme was pursued with a pair of expressed principal objectives. First, the ESA was keen to perform a demonstration of the ability of the European space industry to design and produce low-cost reentry vehicles, as well as its ability to handle the critical mission phases involved in their operation, such as sub-orbital flight, reentry and vehicle recovery. In addition, the ARD was equipped with a comprehensive suite of sensors and recording equipment so that detailed measurements were obtained during testing; it was recognised that exploration of various phenomena across the successive phases of flight would be of high value. The data gained would be subsequently catalogued and harnessed during further programmes, especially future reentry vehicles and reusable launch systems. The prime contractor selected to perform the ARD's development and construction was French aerospace company Aérospatiale (which later merged into the multinational EADS – SPACE Transportation group). During 1995 and 1996, multiple development studies exploring concepts for the shape of such a vehicle were conducted; ultimately, it was decided to adopt a configuration that resembled the classical manned Apollo capsule which had been previously operated by NASA. The use of an existing shape was a deliberate measure to avoid a length exploration of the craft's aerodynamic properties; both the dimensions and mass of the craft were also defined by the capabilities of the Ariane 5 expendable launch system used to deploy the vehicle. It has been claimed that even early on, the programme schedule was relatively tight and funding was limited. According to the ESA, the restrictive financing of the programme was an intentional effort, to prove that such a vehicle could be demonstrated with a smaller budget than previous efforts had been. The experience and data obtained through ARD, ARES and IVX demonstrators are serving as developmental stepping stones towards a vehicle called Space Rider. Design The ARD is an unmanned 3-axis stabilised automated capsule which served as experimental reentry vehicle primarily for technology-proving and data-gathering purposes.\\"The Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator.\\" European Space Agency, October 1998. BR-138. In terms of its shape, the vehicle bares an external resemblance to a 70 per cent-scale version of the American Apollo capsule, and considered by the ESA to be a 50 per cent-scale vehicle of a prospective potentially operational transportation vehicle; as such, it is 2.8 meters in diameter and weighs 2.8 tons at atmospheric interface point. The ARD possesses an air- and water-tight pressurised structure primarily composed of an aluminium alloy, which is protected by a layer of Norcoat 62250 FI cork composite tiles across the exterior of nosecone and by an arrangement of aleastrasil silicon dioxide- phenol formaldehyde resin tiles over the heat shield. The vehicle itself can be divided into three distinct sections: the frontshield section, the rear- cone section and the backcover section. The ARD possesses manoeuvrability capabilities during re-entry; a favourable lift-to-drag ratio is achieved via an off-set center of gravity. The guidance law is akin to that of Apollo and the Space Shuttle, being based on a drag-velocity profile control and bank angles manoeuvres in order to conform with heating, load factor, rebound, and other required conditions; according to the ESA, this provided acceptable final guidance accuracy (within 5 km) with limited real-time calculation complexity. In operation, the guidance system becomes active once the aerodynamic forces become efficient and as long as the reaction control system remains efficient. Instead of using flight control surfaces, non-linear control is instead ensured by an assortment of seven hydrazine thrusters which, according to the manufacturer, were derived from the Ariane 5 expendable launch system. These rocket thrusters, each typically generating 400-N of thrust, were arranged in a blow-down configuration and positioned so that three units provide pitch control, two for roll and two for yaw. During its reentry into the atmosphere, the ARD's heat shield is exposed to temperatures reaching as high as 2000 °C and a heat flux peaking at 1000 kW/m2, resulting from the ionisation of the atmosphere, which is in turn caused by the vehicle travelling at hypersonic speeds, in excess of 27,000 km/h during parts of its reentry descent. While the conical area of the vehicle may reach 1000 °C, with a heat flux of 90–125 kW/m2, the interior temperature will not rise above 40 °C. The thermal protection measures used were a combination of pre-existing materials that Aerospatiale had already developed under French military programmes along with multiple new-generation materials, the latter of which had been principally included for testing purposes. During reentry, the ARD's head shield loses only 0.5 mm of its thickness, keeping its aerodynamic shape relatively constant, which in turn simplifies the flight control algorithms. The vehicle is equipped with a Descent Recovery System (DRS), deployed prior to splashdown in order to limit the impact loads and to ensure its flotation for up to 36 hours. This system involving the deployment of multiple parachutes, stored within the internal space of the tip of the nose cone; in total, one flat ribbon pilot chute, one conical ribbon drogue chute with a single reefing stage, and three slotted ribbon main parachutes with two reefing stages are typically deployed. For buoyancy purposes, a pair of inflatable balloons are also present in the DRS, helping to keep the vehicle upright. To aid in its recovery, the ARD is furnished with both a satellite-based search and rescue radio beacon and flashing light. The internal space of the ARD and was packed with the most advanced technologies to test and qualify new technologies and flight control capabilities for atmospheric reentry and landing. The avionics of the vehicle were primarily sourced from existing equipment used upon the Ariane 5 launcher. The guidance and navigation systems used a computerised inertial navigation system which, via a databus, would be automatically corrected by GPS during the ballistic phase of flight. However, the ARD was designed to be tolerant to instances of GPS failure; this is achieved via a series of control loop algorithms that verify the GPS-derived data to be within a pre- established ‘credibility window’, defined by the inertial navigation readings. During the vehicle's sole mission, it continuously recorded and transmitted to the ground in excess of 200 critical parameters that were used to analyse the ARD's flight performance as well as the behaviour of the equipment on board. Operational history The ARD only performed a single spaceflight. On 21 October 1998, the ARD was launched upon the third flight of the Ariane 5 expendable launch system. It was released shortly after separation of the launcher's cryogenic main stage (at an altitude of about 216 km) 12 minutes after lift-off from the Guiana Space Centre, Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The ARD attained a recorded altitude of 830 km, after which a guided reentry into the atmosphere was conducted. It splashed down to within 4.9 km of its target point in the Pacific Ocean between the Marquesas Islands and Hawaii after one hour and 41 minutes of flight. The ARD was recovered roughly five hours following splash down. Following recovery, the vehicle was transported back to Europe and subject to detailed technical analysis in order to acquire more information on its performance. Engineers analysing data from its sub-orbital flight reported that all the capsule's systems had performed well and according to expectations; analysis of the craft's real-time telemetry broadcast during the flight had also reported that all electrical equipment and propulsion systems functioned nominally. The onboard telemetry systems and reception stations had all performed well, and the onboard GPS receiver worked satisfactorily during the entire flight except, as expected, during black-out in reentry. Following post-mission analysis of the ARD's performance, it was announced that all of the demonstration and system requirements of the programme had been successfully achieved. The test flight itself was described as having been \\"nearly nominal\\", particularly the trajectory and flight control aspects; additionally, many of the onboard systems, such as the navigation (primary and backup), propulsion, thermal protection, communication, and DRS were found to have performed either as predicted or to have been outside these predictions by only a small margin. During reentry, the heat shield temperature reached a recorded peak temperature of 900 °C; nevertheless, both the vehicle's cone and heat shield thermal protection were found in a perfect state following its retrieval. Issues highlighted during analysis included the role of design uncertainties having led to difficulties in observing some physical phenomena such as real gas effects, addressing aerothermal environment characterization was also hindered due to the premature failure of some thermocouples. Overall, the flight was stated to have brought a great amount of high quality aerodynamic information back which, amongst other benefits, served to confirm and enhance the capabilities of ground-based prediction tools. Since its retrieval and the conclusion of post-mission examination, the sole ARD vehicle itself has been preserved and has become a publicly-accessible exhibit at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, Netherlands.

Viruses are one of the two major causes of pneumonia, the other being bacteria; less common causes are fungi and parasites. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children, while in adults bacteria are a more common cause.National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, U.S.A. What Causes Pneumonia? Signs and symptoms Symptoms of viral pneumonia include fever, non-productive cough, runny nose, and systemic symptoms (e.g. myalgia, headache). Different viruses cause different symptoms. Cause Common causes of viral pneumonia are: * Influenza virus A and B * Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) * Human parainfluenza viruses (in children)Table 13-7 in: 8th edition. *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Rarer viruses that commonly result in pneumonia include: * Adenoviruses (in military recruits) * Metapneumovirus * Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) * Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) * Hantaviruses Viruses that primarily cause other diseases, but sometimes cause pneumonia include: * Herpes simplex virus (HSV), mainly in newborns or young children * Varicella- zoster virus (VZV) * Measles virus * Rubella virus * Cytomegalovirus (CMV), mainly in people with immune system problems * Smallpox virus *Dengue virus The most commonly identified agents in children are respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses.  History  In the pre-antibiotic age, pneumonias had been treated with specific anti-serums of highly variable therapeutic effect and undesirable side-effects (a practice eliminated by the advent of sulfamides in 1936 and the beginning availability of penicillin in the 1940s). Viral pneumonia was first described by Hobart Reimann in 1938, in an article published by JAMA, An Acute Infection of the Respiratory Tract with Atypical Pneumonia: a disease entity probably caused by a filtrable virus. Reimann, Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Jefferson Medical College, had established the practice of routinely typing the pneumoccocal organism in cases where pneumonia presented. Out of this work, the distinction between viral and bacterial strains was noticed. Pathophysiology Viruses must invade cells in order to reproduce. Typically, a virus will reach the lungs by traveling in droplets through the mouth and nose with inhalation. There, the virus invades the cells lining the airways and the alveoli. This invasion often leads to cell death either through direct killing by the virus or by self-destruction through apoptosis. Further damage to the lungs occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. White blood cells, in particular lymphocytes, are responsible for activating a variety of chemicals (cytokines) which cause leaking of fluid into the alveoli. The combination of cellular destruction and fluid-filled alveoli interrupts the transportation of oxygen into the bloodstream. In addition to the effects on the lungs, many viruses affect other organs and can lead to illness affecting many different bodily functions. Some viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infection; for this reason, bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia. Prevention The best prevention against viral pneumonia is vaccination against influenza, adenovirus, chickenpox, herpes zoster, measles, and rubella. Treatment In cases of viral pneumonia where influenza A or B are thought to be causative agents, patients who are seen within 48 hours of symptom onset may benefit from treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has no direct acting treatments, but ribavirin in indicated for severe cases. Herpes simplex virus and varicella- zoster virus infections are usually treated with aciclovir, whilst ganciclovir is used to treat cytomegalovirus. There is no known efficacious treatment for pneumonia caused by SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, adenovirus, hantavirus, or parainfluenza. Care is largely supportive. Epidemiology Viral pneumonia occurs in about 200 million people a year which includes about 100 million children and 100 million adults.

Description It is a rather scruffy- looking bird, with a total length of approximately .Payne RB (1997). \\"Guira Cuckoo (Guira guira)\\". p. 603. In: del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J (editors). (1997). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Vol. 4. Sandgrouse to Cuckoos. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions. The sexes are very similar in appearance, except that the female is slightly larger than the male. Juveniles appear quite similar to adults. The species has dark brown upperparts streaked with white, and whitish-buff throat, breast, underparts and rump. The tail is relatively long and broad, dark brown in color with a white-tip, and the legs are dark gray. The eyes and beak are yellow to orange, with a thin ring of featherless yellow skin around the eye (this commonly fades in captivity). There is a prominent orange-rufous crest. Like other members of the subfamily Crotophaginae, the guira cuckoo gives off a strong, pungent odour. Behaviour The guira cuckoo is a bird of open habitats such as pastures and wetlands, and its range has expanded significantly due to deforestation. Within its distribution, it is commonly seen in suburban parks and gardens. Like the related squirrel cuckoo, the guira cuckoo is not a particularly adept flier, and usually flies only for short distances. It is often seen gliding or hopping from one perch to another while vocalizating loudly. The bird's call is unmistakable for being long and shrill, something between a long whistle and a wailing. Although it is primarily an arboreal bird, it is often seen foraging on the ground, sometimes alone but often in flocks of up to 18 individuals. It is sometimes seen with other birds whose behaviour is similar, such as the smooth-billed ani. Unlike many of the Old World cuckoos, the guira cuckoo does not practice brood parasitism or kleptoparasitism. =Feeding= Guira cuckoo (Guira guira) with a captured frog. Tacuaras, Ñeembucú Department, Paraguay. The guira cuckoo is an opportunistic predator, gathering small prey items on the ground or searching for them among branches. It feeds on worms, insects and other arthropods, tadpoles and frogs, eggs, small birds (especially nestlings) and small mammals such as mice.José Felipe Monteiro Pereira (2008). Aves e Pássaros Comuns do Rio de Janeiro. Rio de Janeiro: Technical Books. . p. 71. It also has been observed feeding on lizards.Bernarde, Paulo Sérgio; Mota da Silva, Ageane; Recoder, Renato (2016). \\"Predation on the lizard Pantodactylus parkeri Ruibal, 1952 (Squamata: Gymnophthalmodae) by Guira guira (Aves, Cuculidae) in the Pantanal at Pocone, Western Brazil\\".

Background  Robert Collier established Collier Motors in 1955 as a single entrepreneur while in his 20s. His father was also in the automobile business and continued working until he was in his 80s. Collier transitioned from marketing Chevrolets to selling cars made by American Motors Corporation (AMC). The longstanding relationship with AMC continued until the automaker was partially purchased by Renault in 1979. After AMC started importing Renaults, Collier decided he preferred to sell only domestic- designed and built AMC cars. Rather than selling new Renault-derived passenger cars, such as the Alliance, Collier continued to sell the pre-Renault stock he already had on the lot, but focused his dealership on older AMC cars and Jeep vehicles. American Motors was bought by Chrysler in 1987. The property is on the west side of old U.S. Route 117. By 2010, the business was described as having \\"vehicles and parts slowly returning to the soil.\\" Collier died on February 11, 2018, at the age of 88.

(see p. 69) ()Abdurrahman Sharafkandi (Hejar), Henbane Borîne (Kurdish-Kurdish-Persian Dictionary), Soroush Press, 1991, Tehran, p. 715 is the celebration of the arrival of spring and new year in Kurdish culture. It is celebrated by all Iranic peoples (e.g. Kurds, Persians, Lurs etc.) Before the Islamization of the Iranic peoples, they followed Zoroastrianism. In Zoroastrian doctrine, fire is a symbol of light, goodness and purification. Angra Mainyu, the demonic anti-thesis of Zoroastrianism, was defied by Zoroastrians with a big fire every year, which symbolized their defiance of and hatred for evil and the arch-demon. In Kurdish legend, the holiday celebrates the deliverance of the Kurds from a tyrant, and it is seen as another way of demonstrating support for the Kurdish cause. The celebration coincides with the March equinox which usually falls on 21 March and is usually held between 18 and 24 March. The festival has an important place in terms of Kurdish identity for the majority of Kurds, mostly in Iraq, Turkey and Syria. Though celebrations vary, people generally gather together to welcome the coming of spring; they wear coloured clothes and dance together. Mythology The arrival of spring has been celebrated in Asia Minor since neolithic times. The root of this story goes back to ancient Iranian legends, retold in General History by scientist Dinawari,al-Dinawari, Ahmad b. Dawud. Kitab al-akhbar al-tiwal. Edited by V.Guirgass. Leiden. 1888, see p. 7 The Meadows of Gold by Muslim historian Masudi,Hakan Ozoglu, Kurdish notables and the Ottoman State, 2004, SUNY Press, page: 30. the Shahnameh, a poetic opus written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi around 1000 AD, and the Sharafnameh by the medieval Kurdish historian Sherefxan Bidlisi. Zahak, who is named Zuhak by the Kurds, was an evil Assyrian king who conquered Iran and had serpents growing from his shoulders. Zahak's rule lasted for one thousand years; his evil reign caused spring to no longer come to Kurdistan. During this time, two young men were sacrificed daily and their brains were offered to Zahak's serpents in order to alleviate his pain. However, the man who was in charge of sacrificing the two young men every day would instead kill only one man a day and mix his brains with those of a sheep in order to save the other man. As discontent grew against Zahak's rule, the nobleman Fereydun planned a revolt.In some of the present Kurdish versions of the story of Zahak and Kawa, there is no mention of Fereydun. van Bruinessen, Vol. 3, pp. 1–11, 2000. In the Ahl-e Haqq (Yarsan) Kurdish tradition, Kawa rebelled against Zahak and helped Fereydun imprison Zahak inside Mount Damavand. Hajj Nematollah, Shah-Nama-Ye Haqiqat, Intishaaraat Jeyhun (1982). The revolt was led by Kaveh (also known as Kawa) (in the Ossetian language, Kurdalægon), a blacksmith who had lost six sons to Zahak. The young men who had been saved from the fate of being sacrificed (who according to the legend were ancestors of the Kurds05001 Zahak ) were trained by Kaveh into an army that marched to Zahak's castle where Kaveh killed the king with a hammer. Kaveh is said to have then set fire to the hillsides to celebrate the victory and summon his supporters; spring returned to Kurdistan the next day. March 20 is traditionally marked as the day that Kaveh defeated Zahak. This legend is now used by the Kurds to remind themselves that they are a different, strong people, and the lighting of the fires has since become a symbol of freedom. It is a tradition to jump across a fire at Newroz. According to Evliya Çelebi, the district (sancak) of Merkawe in Shahrazur in the southeastern part of Iraqi Kurdistan is named after Kaveh.Martin van Bruinessen, \\"Kurdistan in the 16th and 17th centuries, as reflected in Elviya Çelebi's Seyahatname\\", The Journal of Kurdish Studies, Vol. 3, pp. 1–11, 2000. The 12th century geographer Yaqoot Hamawi mentions Zor (Zur), son of Zahhak (Aji Dahak), as founder of the famous city of Sharazor.Kitab Mu'jam Al Buldan by Yaqoot Hamawi, Book 3, p: 425-427 It is a tradition to jump across a fire at Newroz. In the 1930s, the Kurdish poet Taufik Abdullah, wanting to instill a new Kurdish cultural revival, used a previously known, modified version of the story of Kawa. He connected the myths where people felt oppressed with Newroz, thus reviving a dying holiday and making it a symbol of the Kurdish national struggle.Connecting celebration of the new year with injustice and oppression is also reflected in the Coptic celebration of Nayrouz, whose chronology begins when Diocletian became Roman emperor. However, Kurds celebrated Newroz long before this, and the word \\"Newroz\\" was mentioned in Kurdish poetry from the 16th century. Newroz customs and celebration Newroz is considered the most important festival in Kurdish culture, and is a time for entertainment such as games, dancing, family gathering, preparation of special foods and the reading of poetry. The celebration of Newroz has its local peculiarities in different regions of Kurdistan. On the eve of Newroz, in southern and eastern Kurdistan, bonfires are lit. These fires symbolize the passing of the dark season, winter, and the arrival of spring, the season of light. The 17th century Kurdish poet Ahmad Khani mentions in one of his poems how the people, youth and elderly, leave their houses and gather in countryside to celebrate Newroz. Armenian scholar Mardiros Ananikian emphasizes the identical nature of Newroz and the Armenian traditional New Year, Navasard, noting that it was only in the 11th century that Navasard came to be celebrated in late summer rather than in early spring. He states that the Newroz - Navasard “was an agricultural celebration connected with commemoration of the dead […] and aiming at the increase of the rain and the harvests.”1 The great center of Armenian Navasard, Ananikian points out, was Bagavan, the center of fire worship. Political overtones Newroz in Istanbul Newroz in Istanbul Newroz in Diyarbakir The Kurdish association with Newroz has become increasingly pronounced since the 1950s when the Kurds in the Middle East and those in the diaspora in Europe started adopting it as a tradition. Following the persecution the Kurds suffered in Turkey, the revival of the Newroz celebration has become more intense and politicized and has also become a symbol of the Kurdish resurrection. By the end of the 1980s, Newroz was mainly associated with the attempts to express and resurrect the Kurdish identity. While the Kurdish celebration has taken the form of a political expression in Turkey, most Kurdish celebrations in Iran are identical to the national festivals. Ethnographer Mehrdad R. Izady states that the reason for this may be that the original tradition and folklore behind Newroz has been lost in the northern and western parts of Kurdistan, where it never evolved in the same way as in the southern and eastern parts. Izady further states that perhaps Newroz has just been getting better press because of the prominence that its staunchest adherents – the Kurds in the Iraqi and Iranian Kurdish regions – have been enjoying through their more frequent popular uprisings. Thus the western and northern Kurds seem to perceive the celebration of the new year as a unifying political expression. In 2000, Turkey legalized the celebration of the spring holiday, spelling it \\"Nevruz\\" and claiming it as a Turkish spring holiday. Using the Kurdish spelling \\"Newroz\\" has been officially forbidden,Bianet :: Let Newroz and Nevruz bring Peace and Spring! though it is still widely used by Kurds. In the Kurdish regions of Turkey, specifically in Eastern Anatolia but also in Istanbul and Ankara where there are large Kurdish populations, people gather and jump over bonfires. Previous to it being legalized, the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, had chosen the date of the Newroz festival to stage attacks to obtain publicity for their cause; this led to Turkish forces detaining thousands of people who were seen as supporters of the Kurdish rebel movements. During the Newroz celebrations of 1992, more than 90 Kurdish participants were killed by the Turkish government. In 2008, two participants were killed. In Syria, the Kurds dress up in their national dress and celebrate the new year. According to Human Rights Watch, Syrian Kurds have had to struggle to celebrate Newroz, and in the past the celebration has led to violent oppression, leading to several deaths and mass arrests. The government has stated that the Newroz celebrations will be tolerated as long as they do not become political demonstrations of the treatment of the Kurds. During the Newroz celebrations in 2008, three Kurds were shot dead by Syrian security forces.Three Kurds killed in Syria shooting, human rights group says – Middle East Kurds in the diaspora also celebrate the new year: Kurds in Australia celebrate Newroz not only as the beginning of the new year but also as Kurdish National Day; the Kurds in Finland celebrate the new year as a way of demonstrating their support for the Kurdish cause. In London, organizers estimated that 25,000 people celebrated Newroz in March 2006. Newroz in Kurdish literature Newroz has been mentioned in works of many Kurdish poets and writers as well as musicians. One of the earliest records of Newroz in Kurdish literature is from Melayê Cizîrî (1570–1640): :Without the light and the fire of Love, :Without the Designer and the power of Creator, :We are not able to reach Union. :(Light is for us and dark is the night) :This fire massing and washing the Heart, :My heart claim after it. :And here come Newroz and the New Year, :When a such light is rising. Kurdish family in Bisaran, Iran The famous Kurdish writer and poet Piramerd (1867–1950) writes in his 1948 poem \\"Newroz\\": :The New Year's day is today. Newroz is back. :An ancient Kurdish festival, with joy and verdure. :For many years, the flower of our hopes was downtrodden :The poppy of spring was the blood of the youth :It was that red colour on the high horizon of Kurd :Which was carrying the happy tidings of dawn to remote and near nations :It was Newroz which imbued the hearts with such a fire :That made the youth receive death with devoted love :Hooray! The sun is shining from the high mountains of homeland :It is the blood of our martyrs which the horizon reflects :It has never happened in the history of any nation :To have the breasts of girls as shields against bullets :Nay. It is not worth crying and mourning for the martyrs of homeland :They die not. They live on in the heart of the nation.

The sixth son of his predecessor, Emperor Duzong, Zhao Xian came to the throne around the age of four, and reigned for less than two years before he was forced to abdicate in 1276. He was succeeded by his fifth brother, Zhao Shi, enthroned as Emperor Duanzong. Reign Emperor Duzong died in 1274 from overindulgence in wine. His sixth son, Zhao Xian, who was then about four years old, was enthroned as the new emperor with assistance from the chancellor Jia Sidao. In the following year, Zhao Xian's grandmother (Grand Empress Dowager Xie) and mother (Empress Dowager Quan) became regents for the child emperor, although state and military power remained under Jia Sidao's control. By the time Zhao Xian came to the throne, the Mongol Empire had already taken control of the northern and southwestern areas of China, crossed the Yangtze River and acquired key strategic locations such as Xiangyang. They were heading towards the Song capital at Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou). Grand Empress Dowager Xie pursued a dual-strategy to the pending destruction of the Song dynasty: On one hand, she ordered the people to rally behind their emperor and save the Song Empire. On the other hand, she tried to make peace with the Mongols. The Mongol army advanced further and captured Song territories and took control of various prefectures along the middle stretches of the Yangtze River. In early 1275, Jia Sidao led an army of 30,000 to engage the Mongols at Wuhu. The Song army suffered defeat and not long afterward, bowing to public pressure, Grand Empress Dowager Xie ordered Jia Sidao's execution. However, the move came too late and the fall of the Song dynasty loomed closer. By the middle of 1275, the Mongol army had controlled most of the Jiangdong region, the southern part of present-day Jiangsu Province. On 18 January 1276, the Mongol general Bayan showed up with his army outside Lin'an. The Song imperial court sent Lu Xiufu to negotiate for peace with the enemy, but Lu was forced to surrender. Later that year, Grand Empress Dowager Xie brought the five-year-old Zhao Xian with her to the Mongol camp to surrender. Remnants of the Song Empire fled southwards to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, where they continued to resist the Mongols. Zhao Xian's fifth brother, Zhao Shi, was enthroned as the new Emperor Duanzong. Zhao Shi died of illness in 1278 after fleeing the Mongols and was succeeded by his seventh brother, Zhao Bing. In 1279, after the Battle of Yamen, Lu Xiufu brought Zhao Bing with him to Yashan (present-day Yamen, Guangdong Province), where they committed suicide by drowning themselves at sea. The death of Zhao Bing marked the end of the Song dynasty. Ennoblement by the Yuan dynasty After the fall of the Song dynasty, Zhao Xian was relocated to the Mongol capital at Dadu (present-day Beijing) then later to Shangdu. Some sources also claim that he lived in Qianzhou (謙州; present-day Tuva in South Central Siberia). His sojourns made him one of the most well- travelled Han Chinese emperors in Chinese history. =Journey to the Mongol capital= Soon after Zhao Xian surrendered, the Mongol general Bayan urged him to travel north for an audience with the Mongol emperor, Kublai Khan. As a result, in March 1276, Zhao Xian left Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) and proceeded towards Shangdu. Grand Empress Dowager Xie remained behind due to illness so he was accompanied northwards by Empress Dowager Quan, the Lady of Long (隆國夫人; Emperor Duzong's mother), Zhao Yurui (趙與芮; Emperor Lizong's younger brother and Zhao Xian’s grandfather), Zhao Naiyou (趙乃猷), and members of the privy council Gao Yinggong (高應松) and Xie Tang (謝堂). The former emperor's entourage also included Weng Zhongde (翁仲德), Wang Yuanliang (汪元量), and other palace officials. After they crossed the Yangtze River, two former generals, Li Tingzhi (李庭芝) and Miao Zaicheng (苗再成), planned to hijack a transport to carry them all but failed. The group arrived in Dadu in May, and then proceeded to Shangdu, where Kublai Khan received them in the Hall of Great Peace (大安殿). The Khan conferred the title \\"Duke of Ying\\" (瀛國公) on Zhao Xian and a princess title on Zhao Xian's Mongol wife, Lady Borjigin. Kublai Khan further ordered that Zhao Xian and Lady Borjigin be given a residence in Dadu and receive preferential treatment. In 1298, Zhao Xian was given permission to move his residence to Shangdu. Between 1314 and 1320, the Mongol ruler Emperor Renzong received the Goryeo ruler Chungseon at his court. Chungseon asked to see visit Zhao Xian's residence and composed a song about him. =Relocation to Tibet= Kublai Khan wanted to preserve some vestiges of the Song imperial clan and in October 1288 issued an edict ordering Zhao Xian to relocate to Tibet. There, Zhao Xian was to study the Brahmana and Tibetan classics. Other sources claim that while in Tibet, Zhao Xian decided to study Buddhism instead. Kublai Khan's motive for this edict is unclear, as is whether such a relocation constituted a banishment. The Khan may have acted out of genuine concern for the former emperor or he may have wished to remove the Song heir to the throne out of China proper. In December 1288, Zhao Xian departed from Amdo (, Wylie: mdo smad; Chinese: 朵思麻) in present-day Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, for Ü-Tsang (, Wylie: dbus gtsang; Chinese: 烏思藏) within the borders of present-day Tibet. He became a resident at the Sakya Monastery and was given the dharma name \\"Chos kyi Rin chen\\" (). Later on, Zhao Xian took over as the head monk at the monastery, translating Buddhist texts between the Chinese and Tibetan languages under the name \\"Sman rce Lha btsun\\" (, Chinese: 蛮子合尊 manzihézūn), which means \\"royalty of Mangi\\" (southern barbarian) in Tibetan language. Death According to Sakya's monastic succession records, in April 1323, the 52-year-old Zhao Xian received an imperial edict ordering him to commit suicide at Hexi (河西; present-day Zhangye, Gansu Province. Many Ming Historians believed that this was because Zhao Xian's poetry displeased the Mongol ruler, Emperor Yingzong. Other Ming Historians believe that Yingzong feared a coup led by Zhao Xian. Emperor Gong’s unofficial temple name is Gongzong (恭宗) Family * Parents: ** Zhao Qi, Duzong (; 1240–1274) ** Empress, of the Quan clan (; 1241–1309) * Consorts and Issue: ** Lady, of the Borjigin clan () （拉施特 Rashid-al-Din Hamadani《史集》 Jami' al-tawarikh 之忽必烈汗紀、陳霆《兩山墨談》、谈迁《国榷》等） *** Zhao Wanpu (), first son \\\\---- Zhao Xian had one son with the Borjigin Mongol woman, Zhao Wanpu. Zhao Xian's son Zhao Wanpu was kept alive by the Mongols because of his mother's royal Mongolian Borjigin ancestry even after Zhao Xian was killed. Instead Zhao Wanpu was only moved and exiled. The outbreak of the Song loyalist Red Turban Rebellion in Henan led to a recommendation that Zhao Wanpu should be transferred somewhere else by an Imperial Censor in 1352. The Yuan did not want the Chinese rebels to get their hands on Zhao Wanpu so no one was permitted to see him and Zhao Wanpu's family and himself were exiled to Shazhou near the border by the Yuan Emperor. Paul Pelliot and John Andrew Boyle commented on Rashid-al-Din Hamadani's chapter The Successors of Genghis Khan in his work Jami' al-tawarikh, identified references by Rashid al-Din to Zhao Xian in his book where he mentions a Chinese ruler who was an \\"emir\\" and son-in-law to the Qan (Khan) after being removed from his throne by the Mongols and he is also called \\"Monarch of Song\\", or Suju (宋主 Songzhu) in the book. According to a Ming story Zhao Xian had an affair with Yuan Empress Mailaiti, a descendant of Arslan Khan of the Karluks, a wife of Yuan Emperor Mingzong. Zhao Xian allegedly fathered Yuan Emperor Huizong with Mailaiti.《庚申外史》 The Mongols circulated a similar story about the Yongle Emperor.

He has been described as the \\"progenitor of modern humanism in Britain\\". Biography Blackham was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, on 31 March 1903, to Harriet Mary (1872–1955) and Walter Roland Blackham (1875–1911). His siblings were Olive Dingle Blackham (1899–2002), Lorna Langstone Blackham (1900–1992), Sylvia Kerslake Blackham (1907–2000), and Joyce Maude Blackham (1909–1993). Blackham left school following the end of World War I, and became a farm labourer, before gaining a place at Birmingham University to study divinity and history. He acquired a teaching diploma and was the divinity master at Doncaster Grammar School. Joining the Ethical Union, Blackham drew the organisation further away from religious forms and played an important part in its formation into the British Humanist Association, becoming the BHA's first Executive Director in 1963. He was also a founding member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU), IHEU secretary (1952–1966), and received the IHEU's International Humanist Award in 1974, and the Special Award for Service to World Humanism in 1978. In addition he was one of the signatories to the Humanist Manifesto. During his time at the Ethical Union/BHA, Blackham co- founded the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, and as chairman of the Friends of Austria assisted Austrian children fleeing the Nazis to come to the UK. His book, Six Existentialist Thinkers, became a popular university textbook. In 1977, Blackham retired to the Wye valley. He suffered a stroke in 2000, and on 23 January 2009, he died at a care home in Brockhampton, Herefordshire, aged 105. Publications *Bury, JB, with an historical epilogue by HJ Blackham.

Biography Anne Nichols was born in obscure Dales Mill, in Wayne County, Georgia, to Julie and George Nichols. Her father George was the son of James Nicholas born in 1868. George had the Nicholas surname shortened to Nichols. Anne penned a number of Broadway plays, several of which were made into motion pictures. Her most famous production was Abie's Irish Rose, a farce depicting the tumult that arises with the marriage of a young Jewish man and an Irish girl. This play broke the record for the longest run in Broadway theater history, and was made into films in 1928 and again in 1946. Nichols sued Universal Studios for making The Cohens and Kellys, a film with a similar plot premise, but the use of stock characters was found to be outside of copyright protection in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp. To a certain degree, Abie's Irish Rose paralleled the life of its author, who was born into a strict Baptist family, but married (and divorced) Henry Duffy, an Irish Catholic. Nichols wrote the play during this marriage, and would eventually convert to Catholicism herself.Georgia playwright \\"Anne Nichols wrote in 'the spirit of tolerance'\\" Southern Cross, February 15, 2007 In 1937 Nichols produced Hey Diddle Diddle, a comedy play written by Bartlett Cormack whose setting was a duplex apartment in Hollywood. The play premiered in Princeton, New Jersey, on January 21 with Lucille Ball as Julie Tucker, \\"one of three roommates coping with neurotic directors, confused executives, and grasping stars who interfere with the girls' ability to get ahead.\\" The play received good reviews, but there were problems, chiefly with its star, Conway Tearle, who was in poor health. Cormack wanted to replace him, but Nichols said the fault lay with the character and insisted that the part needed to be reshaped and rewritten. The two were unable to agree on a solution. The play was scheduled to open on Broadway at the Vanderbilt, but closed after one week in Washington, D.C., when Tearle suddenly became gravely ill.Brady, Kathleen (2001), Lucille: the Life of Lucille Ball, New York, New York: Watson-Guptill Publications, p. 73-74, Nichols died from a heart attack while residing at a nursing home in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, at the age of 75.Staff. \\"Anne Nichols Is Dead at 75; Author of 'Abie's Irish Rose'; Play Panned by Critics Ran 5 Years Here and Became Film and Radio Show \\", The New York Times, September 16, 1966.

In 2005, it was reported that no public funding had been set aside for the project and that the Tshwane municipality was seeking private financing to complete the stadium and associated infrastructure. Originally planned for completion in June 2007, the site was downgraded to be used as a training, rather than a match venue for the World Cup. After FIFA decided not to use the proposed stadium at all, selecting Loftus Versfeld Stadium in its place, the development was amended. The new development proposal, covering over 70 hectares, comprises eight phased development areas. Construction is expected to be phased in over 10 to 15 years commencing mid-2012.

The book is highly influential, although it has remained controversial even decades after its publication. Lewy contends that the United States' actions in Vietnam were neither illegal nor immoral, and that tales of American atrocities were greatly exaggerated in what he understands as a \\"veritable industry\\" of war crimes allegations. The text returned to the limelight during the 2004 US Presidential Election, when it was cited by several groups supporting the reelection of George W. Bush, in contending that Democratic presidential contender John Kerry had betrayed his country for his participation in anti-war activities upon his return from service in Vietnam. Overview Published in 1978, America in Vietnam argues against traditional or \\"orthodox\\" interpretations of the war as unnecessary, unjust, or unwinnable. The book has proven highly controversial. Historians of the \\"orthodox\\" school have singled it out for harsh criticism, while the \\"revisionist school\\" of Vietnam historiography holds it to be a watershed in the literature on the war.Martel, Gordon. American Foreign Relations Reconsidered, 1890-1993. 1994, page 141 An infamous text among critics of the Vietnam War, the text has found ardent support among the revisionist minority of academics, such as Norman Podhoretz, Mark Moyar, and Michael Lind. America in Vietnam is frequently characterized as a \\"revisionist\\" history of the Vietnam War. Lewy argues, > It is the reasoned conclusion of this study... that the sense of guilt > created by the Vietnam war in the minds of many Americans is not warranted > and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral > conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield > practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than > in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages of > the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human > life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate > all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be > construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it > remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the > fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this > book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive > possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in > certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of > armed conflict also do care about human suffering.Guenter Lewy, America in > Vietnam, p. VII. The text was praised by US Senator Jim Webb, a Vietnam veteran then of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs staff, and by several newspapers, including The Economist, which described it as \\"in many way the best history of the war yet to appear\\".America in Vietnam, paperback, 1980. Lewy contends that the Vietnam War was legal and not immoral. In recalling the 1971 congressional testimony of some US veterans who were critical of the war, one of whom compared US action in Vietnam to genocide, Lewy suggests that some \\"witnesses sounded as if they had memorized North Vietnamese propaganda.\\"Lewy, Guenter. America in Vietnam. p. 317 The book is broadly critical of domestic opponents of American participation in the Vietnam War. In using the phrases \\"peace activists\\" or \\"peace demonstrations\\", Lewy often puts quotation marks around the word \\"peace\\", implying alternative motivations for the activism. The author suggests there may be a connection between cases of sabotage in the Navy and the anti-war movement: > Between 1965 and 1970, the Navy experienced a growing number of cases of > sabotage and arson on its ships, but no evidence could be found that antiwar > activists had directly participated in a sabotage attempt on a Navy vessel. > Cases of fragging and avoidance of combat may well have been instigated at > times by antiwar militants, though no hard evidence of organized subversion > was ever discovered.Lewy, Guenter. America in Vietnam. p. 159 =Noam Chomsky= Lewy criticized Noam Chomsky in the book for his role in proliferating charges of American war crimes through the aegis of the Committee of Concerned Asia Scholars, which Lewy characterizes as part of a \\"veritable industry\\" of war crimes allegations.Lewy, Guenter. America in Vietnam, p. 224. Chomsky replied to the criticism with an article entitled On the Aggression of South Vietnamese Peasants against the United States, in which he suggests that \\"Lewy is not writing just military history but a moral tract.\\" He said, > In discussing the treatment of prisoners, Lewy shows his reasonableness by > acknowledging \\"several cases of US maltreatment and torture.\\" These are > treated with antiseptic brevity, and Lewy takes pains to put them into a > context of the \\"frustration resulting from fighting an often unseen enemy, > the resentments created by casualties,\\" etc. In dealing with Communist > inhumaneness, however, he gives a plenitude of detail, with an unconcealed > moral indignation totally absent from his grudging admission of US-Saigon > torture, and factors that might explain such acts by the enemy are treated > with sarcasm. He even matter-of-factly explains Saigon torture: \\"The police > were not highly professional, prison guards were underpaid, and South > Vietnamese have a low regard for human life.\\" =\\"Revisionism\\"= America in Vietnam has frequently been assailed as a \\"revisionist\\" text. The book has been referred to as \\"a classic revisionist interpretation of the war\\",Dittmar, Linda and Michaud, Gene. From Hanoi to Hollywood. 1990, page 86 \\"the first and most impressive of the revisionist accounts\\" of the Vietnam war,Capps, Walter H. The Vietnam Reader. 1991, page 106 and \\"one of the earliest and most sophisticated of revisionist works\\". In the text itself, Lewy asserts that he is attempting to \\"clear away the cobwebs of mythology that inhibit the correct understanding of what went on -- and what went wrong -- in Vietnam.\\"Campbell, Neil and Kean, Alsdair. American Cultural Studies: An Introduction to American Culture p. 255 =Adherents= Among adherents of the text, Mark Moyar wrote in his 2006 Triumph Forsaken that \\"Lewy's superb book was the best history of the Vietnam War when it was first published, and ... remains one of the best.\\"Moyar, Mark. Triumph Forsaken. 2006, page 422 Moyar has himself contended that the orthodox histories of the Vietnam War incorrectly assert that it was unjust, unnecessary, and unwinnable.http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/133ccyfj.asp The political group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth utilized some of Lewy's work in their 2004 publication Unfit for Command,O'Neill, John E. Unfit for Command. 2004, page 177 and Norman Podhoretz has often cited America in Vietnam and written extensively in its defense. In one text, Podhoretz took aim at those who were attacking Lewy's conception of immorality as illegality in the context of war. \\"The task Lewy sets for himself turns out to be surprisingly simple, for the laws of war are so vaguely stated and so radically incomplete that a brief for the defense is readily put together\\", asserted Michael Walzer; of America in Vietnam, Theodore Draper added, \\"It is a continuing shame... that the shamefulness of this war should be incidentally taken up in a book designed to cover up the shame by taking refuge in narrow and dubious legalisms.\\"Podhoretz, Norman. The Norman Podhoretz Reader. 2004, page 174-7 The wide-held belief that the Vietnam War represented \\"a dramatic collapse of both reason and morality\\" or that it was marked by \\"immoral conduct\\" was answered by Lewy and defended by Podhoretz: > \\"The American way of war,\\" as it came to be called in the polemics of the > period, was based on the motto \\"Expend Shells Not Men.\\" Was it immoral of > American commanders to follow this rule? The antiwar movement thought so, > and Lewy's critics still do. Podhoretz suggests that the struggle against Communism is linked to the struggle against Nazism, because each represents totalitarianism. The Domino Theory was, in Podhoretz's eyes, vindicated by the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, rather than being discredited.Podhoretz, Norman. The Norman Podhoretz Reader. 2004, page 163 Of Podhoretz's Why We Were in Vietnam, one critic asserted that \\"Time and again the footnote for a crucial argument directs the reader to Guenter Lewy's America in Vietnam, a book whose historical objectivity, to put it mildly, is not accepted by all sides.\\" =Is American Guilt Justified?= One way that Guenter Lewy answered his critics was in an essay entitled Is American Guilt Justified? In the essay he suggests that many Americans feels a sense of guilt for having undertaken the Vietnam War, but that \\"the American sense of guilt is not warranted by the facts about the war which we know today.\\"Sevy, Grace. The American Experience in Vietnam. 1991, page 257 > Some of my critics have painted me as a kind of moral leper, comparing me to > those who deny that the Jewish Holocaust happened, that six million Jews > were murdered during the Holocaust. Others say my work is a revisionist job, > useful, perhaps, in stimulating debate, but otherwise too extreme to be > considered reliable. Of course, I disagree with those appraisals. Lewy describes his conception of legality and morality in the context of war, suggesting that what is legal must necessarily be moral as well: \\"Because I show that American military tactics are legal, I clearly also undermine [my critics'] assertion that the American conduct in Vietnam was immoral.\\" He suggests also that \\"immoral conduct must involve immoral intentions\\", which he believes differentiates the \\"free-fire zones\\" in Vietnam from the \\"terror bombing of civilian populations during World War II\\".Sevy, Grace. The American Experience in Vietnam. 1991, page 258-9 Restating some of his arguments from America in Vietnam, Lewy asserts that the war in Vietnam does not constitute genocide for a number of reasons, including lack of genocidal intent and \\"results\\": > According to statistics developed by the United Nations, the population of > South and North Vietnam, during the course of the war, increased at a rate > roughly double that of the United States in a comparable period. That alone > makes the charge of genocide--i.e., intentional destruction of a whole > people--rather grotesque.Sevy, Grace. The American Experience in Vietnam. > 1991, page 262 Winter Soldier Investigation America in Vietnam, which appeared seven years after the Winter Soldier Investigation, became controversial in the context of the 2004 US Presidential Election. Presidential hopeful John Kerry had been involved with the Winter Soldier Investigation; in the context of the campaign, Lewy's suggestion that the Winter Soldier Investigation was dishonest and politically motivated was frequently cited to impugn John Kerry's reputation. Vietnam Veterans Against the War, the group of which Kerry had been a part, alleged that American troops had committed atrocities in Vietnam. Lewy suggests that the group used \\"fake witnesses\\" in the Winter Soldier hearing in Detroit, and that its allegations were formally investigated: > The results of the investigation, carried out by the Naval Investigative > Service, are interesting and revealing. Many of the veterans, though assured > that they would not be questioned about the atrocities they might have > committed personally, refused to be interviewed. One of the active members > of the VVAW told investigators that the leadership had directed the entire > membership not to cooperate with military authorities. A black marine who > agreed to be interviewed was unable to provide details of the outrages he > had described at the hearing, but he called the Vietnam war \\"one huge > atrocity\\" and \\"a racist plot.\\" He admitted that the question of atrocities > had not occurred to him while he was in Vietnam, and that he had been > assisted in the preparation of his testimony by a member of the Nation of > Islam. But the most damaging finding consisted of the sworn statements of > several veterans, corroborated by witnesses, that they had in fact not > attended the hearing in Detroit. One of them had never been to Detroit in > all his life. He did not know, he stated, who might have used his name. Government officials today have no record of any such Naval Investigative Service report, although they suggest that it could have been lost or destroyed. Lewy later said that he could not recall if he had actually seen the alleged report or simply been told of its contents.Rejali, Darius.

The outer ring contains the text \\"The Seal of the State of Washington\\" and \\"1889\\", the year Washington state was admitted to the Union. The seal is featured as the main element on both sides of the flag of Washington. The seal was designed by Charles Talcott, based on a painting by Gilbert Stuart. Originally the seal was to be a scene featuring Mount Rainier, but Talcott proposed the design featuring George Washington instead.  Proposed change  While the state seal has not been considered controversial in any way, during the 2010 United States mid-term and statewide elections, Ballot Measure 1069 was proposed in the state, which would alter the seal. This measure would require the seal of the State of Washington to be changed to depict a vignette of a tapeworm dressed in a three piece suit attached to the lower intestine of a taxpayer shown as the central figure. The seal would be required to be encircled with the following words: “Committed to sucking the life blood out of each and every tax payer.” The illustration would be selected from submissions submitted by taxpayers. The proposal did not qualify to appear on the state ballot.  Seal of the Lieutenant Governor  There is also a seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Washington, created in 1959. The seal was created to mirror aspects of regional interest that embody the traditions and culture of Washington state. The seal is represented by the official state symbols of the willow goldfinch, chosen in 1951 by a run-off between the meadowlark and the goldfinch; the coast rhododendron, voted in by Washington women prior to universal suffrage in 1892; and the twin gavels of the state legislature, representing the bipartisan spirit of lawmaking, all enclosed in a circle.

In 1987 he obtained the catering rights to Toronto's SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) and two years later merged these two companies to form the Bitove Corporation, then one of Canada's largest privately held food service companies. In 1989 Bitove became a member of the Order of Canada. And in 2013 the Republic of Macedonia awarded him The Order of September 8, for efforts on behalf of Macedonia, particularly the nation's independence; Macedonia was the homeland of his and his wife's parents. Bitove was a director of several companies, including Oppenheimer & Co. He also organized, founded and was involved in, many charitable activities, most notably, with Dotsa, the founding of Canadian Macedonian Place, a home for the aged people of Macedonian descent as well as ProAction/Cops&Kids;, a partnership with the Metropolitan Toronto Police to fund programs targeting high-risk youth in Toronto. Various social, educational and medical causes bare the family's name, including the John and Dotsa Bitove Family Law Library at the University of Western Ontario Law School. =Political activity= In the early 1990s, John Bitove founded an International Macedonian Lobby to assist the newly proclaimed Republic of Macedonia on its efforts for international recognition. As a result, former advisors of two United States presidents and one Canadian prime minister were hired to lobby foreign governments, as well as the European Community and the United Nations, to recognise the Republic of Macedonia as a sovereign and independent state. At the same time, Bitove formed the first World Macedonian Congress, an ultranationalist organisation created to promote the interests of the Republic of Macedonia and the ethnic Macedonians throughout the world.Danforth, Loring M., The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Princeton University Press, 1997, p.101. John Bitove provided significant financial resources to the United Macedonian Diaspora.United Macedonian Diaspora’s Companions - A Distinction of Honor , umdiaspora.org He also supported and promoted the United Macedonia, a concept among ethnic Macedonian nationalists that aims to unify the transnational region of Macedonia into a single state with the Greek city of Thessaloniki as its capital. by Metodija Koloski, president of the United Macedonian Diaspora. Personal life He was married to Dotsa and had five children -- Vonna, Tom, Nick, John and Jordan. He died in Toronto in July 2015.

Licensed by Nintendo of America Inc.\\"  Plot  The game starts out with an evil demon ruling over the world and its inhabitants, who live in fear of it. However, a man named Victar, who comes from a small village, has a sword that can destroy the demon. The blade had previously been split up into pieces, though, and Victar must travel through three worlds to get back the three broken pieces in order to restore the sword to defeat the demon.  Gameplay  Basic ground gameplay with sword attack. Enemies crumble when beaten and may leap high. Player can throw ninja stars. Either attack can be used in mid- air. The game contains three worlds, with two stages in each of them plus a final stage making 7 stages total. In order to regain the pieces of the shattered sword and advance in the game, the player must defeat a boss at the end of every stage. As more pieces of the sword are recovered, the sword itself grows in length and power. The player will also encounter enemies on the way to the boss, which must be defeated with a variety of weapons and magic spells, such as the character's Demon Sword (which he begins the game with), arrow darts, and power beams. The player can also jump over enemies and change direction in midair, as well as land in and run on top of trees. However, the player must be careful when jumping, as there are various traps, such as holes, that the player can land in. =Regional differences= *There are six more stages and several bosses in the Japanese version that are unavailable in the North American version. *The player in the North American version has a vitality gauge for each life remaining, while the player in the Japanese has only life count. *There are more items and magic spells available in the Japanese version. *The ending in the Japanese version has extra scenes and text cut from the North American version. *The cover used for the English release of Demon Sword features a muscular bare-chested bronzed man, whereas the sprite in the game appears to be a paler lithe man wearing a red kimono, the Japanese release features a character more similar to the in-game sprite.

The Norwegian Coast Guard is a part of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and has some police authority. In June 2018 it was announced that the Vard Group, a subsidiary of Fincantieri, will build three replacement vessels for NOK 5 billion (US$ ); delivery of the three new vessels is scheduled to be in 1Q 2022, 1Q 2023, and 1Q 2024, respectively.

Due to the fact that these vessels may serve as wartime naval escorts they have provisions to carry additional weapons and sensors, such as anti-ship missiles and torpedoes.

A major part of the Chicago theatre scene, it is the city's oldest currently active nonprofit theater organization. Part of its present theater complex occupies the landmark Harris and Selwyn Theaters property. History The Goodman was founded in 1925 as a tribute to the Chicago playwright Kenneth Sawyer Goodman, who died in the Great Influenza Pandemic in 1918. The theater was funded by Goodman's parents, Mr. and Mrs. William O. Goodman, who donated $250,000 to the Art Institute of Chicago to establish a professional repertory company and a school of drama at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The first theater was designed by architect Howard Van Doren Shaw (in the location now occupied by the museum's Modern Wing), although its design was severely hampered by location restrictions resulting in poor acoustics and lack of space for scenery and effects. The opening ceremony on October 20, 1925, featured three of Kenneth Sawyer Goodman's plays: Back of the Yards, The Green Scarf, and The Game of Chess. Two nights later the theater presented its first public performance, John Galsworthy's The Forest. The company mainly performed student productions with the addition of professional players through to the 1950s. In 1969 under artistic director, John Reich, it finally became a fully professional company. In 1978, the drama school became part of DePaul University. In 2000, the company moved into its new facility at 170 North Dearborn in Chicago's theater district. The project was designed by KPMB Architects, DLK Architecture Inc., McClier Corporation, associated architects. It has two fully modern auditoriums, named the Albert and the Owen, after two members of the Goodman family who continue to be major donors. In August of that year, Associate Artistic Director Michael Maggio died and the company established the Michael Maggio Emerging Designer Award in his honor which is bestowed alongside the Michael Merritt Award for Excellence in Design and Collaboration. Awards In 1992, the theatre company received the Regional Theatre Tony Award, joining Steppenwolf Theatre as Chicago-based recipients of the award. Since then, three other Chicago-based companies, Victory Gardens Theater (in 2001), Chicago Shakespeare Theater (in 2008), and Lookingglass Theatre Company (in 2011) have also received the award, making Chicago the most recognized city in the country by this prestigious live theater award. The Goodman has also won many Joseph Jefferson awards. Productions Goodman Theatre Center With the production of Radio Golf in 2007, the Goodman became the first theater to mount a production of each of the ten plays in August Wilson's Pittsburgh cycle. The theater has presented A Christmas Carol annually in December since the 1970s. Other productions the Goodman has staged over the years include Hay Fever, Lady Windermere's Fan, The Little Foxes, You Can't Take it with You, Born Yesterday, Pal Joey, To Be Young, Gifted and Black (play), Guys and Dolls, Talley's Folly, A House Not Meant to Stand, A Soldier's Play, Fences, Sunday in the Park with George, The Visit, Dancing at Lughnasa, Arcadia, Floyd Collins, Hollywood Arms, Dinner with Friends, The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, The Light in the Piazza, I Am My Own Wife, and Rabbit Hole.

Lyrical subjects included police brutality, consumerism, and even the underground punk scene. Originally, Albert Veith was the band's original bassist, however due to the group being unable to find a drummer he switched to the drums. Doug Long joined the group soon after as the bassist before leaving in 1999. Mark Estes was then asked to play bass. After Mark left, Doug rejoined. They broke up in January 2010, releasing numerous records during their run, most of which was released through guitarist Ken Hansford's label Sound Pollution.

It is a relatively uncommon piercing by choice because of the potential for nerve damage, and because women may find it too stimulating to allow the constant wearing of a small ring or barbell. It is often confused with the more common clitoral hood piercing, which pierces only the hood covering the clitoral glans, allowing the jewellery to make only occasional contact with the most sensitive area. General Recent advances in the piercing art have allowed a number of alternative locations to be popularized with the intention of providing more stimulation than can be achieved from wearing jewellery in the hood, but less than occurs directly from the clitoris. Depending on the anatomy of the individual, a clitoris piercing, especially a clitoral hood piercing, can be oriented either vertically or horizontally. The clitoris is endowed with a very high concentration of nerve endings and like male genital piercings which penetrate the glans penis, clitoral piercings can be extremely sexually stimulating when subjected to gentle manipulation, or vibration, hence their popularity in certain S & M cultures, where small heavy ornaments are often fitted to increase the sensation. Piercer Elayne Angel stated that of the \\"very small number of women who genuinely desire a clitoris piercing (rather than the more common clitoral hood piercing), 90 to 95 percent are not suitably built to accommodate jewelry through the clitoral head.\\" The piercee must have a large enough clitoris to prevent migration of the piercing and subsequent loss because a slightly thicker gauge of jewellery is usually used to prevent the 'cheese-cutter' effect if it becomes caught on clothing, or is pulled too hard during sexual activity.  History and culture  This piercing is of contemporary origin and is uncommon. In 1989, piercer Jim Ward, interviewed by Andrea Juno in Modern Primitives, stated \\"I've been in the business for over 10 years and I haven't done more than half a dozen clit piercings.\\"  Jewelry  Both captive bead rings and barbell style jewelry can be worn in this piercing, both as initial jewelry and in the long term.

Javits Convention Center, commonly known as the Javits Center, is a large convention center on Eleventh Avenue between 34th and 40th Streets in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City. It was designed by architect James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. The space frame structure was begun in 1980, finished in 1986, and named for United States Senator Jacob Javits, who died that year. When the Center opened, it replaced the New York Coliseum as the city's major convention facility, making way for the demolition of the Coliseum and future construction of the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. The Javits Center is operated and maintained by the New York Convention Center Operating Corporation, a New York State public-benefit corporation. The twelfth largest convention center in the United States, it has a total area space of and has of total exhibit space. It is billed as one of the busiest convention centers in the U.S. Organization The New York Convention Center Operating Corporation (NYCCOC) - not to be confused with the New York Convention Center Development Corporation (\\"CCDC\\"), which is a subsidiary of New York State Urban Development Corporation, dba Empire State Development (\\"ESD\\") - operates Javits Center. NYCCOC's management team is headed by President and CEO Alan Steel. There is a 16-member board that provides guidance. In 2017, NYCCOC had operating expenses of $194 million and employed 3,786 people.  Planning  The main plaza at the Javits CenterPlanning and constructing a convention center on Manhattan's west side has had a long and controversial history; proposals for a convention center to replace the New York Coliseum date to 1962, only six years after the Coliseum was completed. A new convention center over the river between 38th and 42nd Streets was included in the City's 1962 plan for the West Side waterfront.George Horne, \\"670-Million, 40-Year Waterfront Plan To Alter West Side Is Urged by Mayor; Convention Center, Docks and Housing Would Be Built,\\" New York Times, April 26, 1963. Several other sites were subsequently studied, including the New York Central rail yard between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues (now known as the Eastern Rail Yard site at Hudson Yards) and the west 50s between Eighth and Ninth avenues.Seth S. King, \\"CONVENTION HALL WEIGHED BY CITY; Two Studies of Needs and Facilities Are Ordered,\\" New York Times, February 10, 1967. Eventually the Lindsay administration included a new convention center between 10th and 11th avenues in the west 40s along with an extensive redevelopment of the West Side in their 1969-70 Plan for New York City. Opposition to the massive residential displacement that this development project would have caused, and the failure of the City to complete any replacement housing, led the State Legislature to kill the convention center proposal in 1970. The City then moved the convention center site to the Hudson River, in place of Piers 84 and 86, despite the high cost of foundations and the lack of space for future expansion. That 44th Street convention center, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was approved by the Board of Estimate in 1973 despite renewed opposition from the local community. In exchange, the community received a special zoning district that offered some protection from development. However the 44th Street convention center was never built because of the City's near bankruptcy in 1975, which led instead to a search by the City and State for a less expensive site with some opportunity for expansion. Three sites were proposed -- the Penn Central rail yard between 11th and 12th Avenues north of 34th Street; Battery Park City; and in the west 40s near Times Square, somewhere between 6th and 7th Avenues or 7th and 8th Avenues. The Battery Park City site was rejected because it was considered to be too far from midtown hotels. The Times Square plan, by the Regional Plan Association, was not seriously considered by the City.Glenn Fowler, \\"Panel Recommends Convention Center Near 34th on River,\\" New York Times, November 23, 1977. The rail yard site was originally proposed by the local community to avoid direct residential displacement that would be caused by office and residential development associated with the convention center. As an alternative to forestall the negative impacts of both, Daniel Gutman, an environmental planner working with the Clinton Planning Council, proposed that the convention center and all major development be located south of 42nd Street. Their proposed convention center site -- between Eleventh and Twelfth avenues from 34th to 39th streets -- was later promoted by Donald Trump, who had obtained an option on the rail yard from the bankrupt Penn Central in 1975. The City and State eventually chose the rail yard site. Although Trump's offer to build the Convention Center was rejected, he was paid a broker's commission by Penn Central.Marilyn Bender, \\"The Empire and Ego of Donald Trump,\\" New York Times, August 7, 1983. The proposal for major office and residential development south of 42nd Street was realized 30 years later in the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project. Construction In March 1979, the New York State Legislature approved a plan to allocate $375 million toward the construction of the convention center near the Penn Central yard. The next month, the architectural firm I. M. Pei and Partners was selected to build the New York Convention and Exhibition Center, as it was called at that time. Immediately after the center's construction was announced, real estate prices in the area increased. Properties that previously had trouble selling suddenly had several potential buyers, spurring real estate speculation. Designs for the center were revealed in December 1979. In March 1980, a few squatters on the site were evicted so the site's structures could be demolished to make room for the New York Convention Center. The ground-breaking ceremony for the center was held on June 18 of that year. In October 1980, the MTA issued $100 million in bonds to pay for the center's construction. The New York Convention Center Development Corporation (CCDC), which was building the Convention Center, proposed building a promenade with restaurants and shops on the building's west side, facing the Hudson River shore. It would also be open year-round, as opposed to other convention centers. At the time, the presence of the Convention Center was supposed to garner $82 million in annual city and state taxes, and the events at the center would allow the city to net $832 million annually. However, a report commissioned by the CCDC found that the center's benefits to the surrounding neighborhood would be reduced due to a lack of public transit and the predominantly industrial zoning of the area. Jerry Lowery was hired to find conventions to host at the New York Convention Center. By late 1981, he had booked 171 conventions for the Convention Center between mid-1984 and late 1986. The problems with the center's construction started in 1982, when it was revealed that there were difficulties in manufacturing the custom parts for the Convention Center's structure. In March 1983, officials stated that the Convention Center was facing cost overruns of at least $16.8 million. The next month, officials announced that the cost overruns had risen to between $25 million and $50 million, and that the center's opening had been postponed to at least 1985. In order to reduce the delay, workers were ordered to speed up construction. Lowery described the delay as \\"disastrous\\" for the city, since the delays left the city vulnerable to lawsuits from the hosts of the 141 conventions that were scheduled to be hosted at the Convention Center through the end of 1985. By April 1984, the opening date had been delayed further to mid-1986. At the time, Governor Mario Cuomo stated that the center would have a new name by the time it opened. He said, \\"It should be reasonably utterable and easy to write. It should be a name that's going to identify it with New York as much as possible.\\" In December 1984, at Cuomo's suggestion, the CCDC officially renamed the New York Convention Center to honor former Senator Jacob K. Javits. The Javits Center was topped out on December 19, 1984. The center was opened on April 3, 1986.Pei Cobb Freed & Partners—Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and Plaza The opening of the Javits Center was accompanied by a five-minute ribbon-cutting ceremony. The first exhibitions to be hosted at the Javits Center were the International Fur Fair and an Art Expo of \\"emerging younger artists\\". A week later, a formal ribbon-cutting was held, with Governor Cuomo, Mayor Ed Koch, and Javits's widow Marian Javits in attendance.

Javits Convention Center and Plaza - Pei Cobb Freed & Partners Architects LLP. Mafia charges In 1995, the Independent Review Board charged that jobs at the Center had come under Mafia control. A New York Times article stated: Expansions On October 16, 2006, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to mark the symbolic start of a $1.7 billion expansion project. The project, which would have expanded the center's size by 45 percent, was scheduled for completion by 2010. Architect Richard Rogers led the design team, and Leslie E. Robertson Associates were the structural engineers. However, the physical constraints on the project site imposed by the Bloomberg administration complicated the design and caused the cost to soar to $5 billion. To address the site constraint, an alternative plan produced in 2007 by Meta Brunzema, an architect, and Daniel Gutman, an environmental planner, for the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association would have expanded the Javits Center south over the Western Rail Yard, the site of the defeated West Side Stadium. Other features of the HKNA plan included an rooftop park, office and residential towers at the corners of the new exhibition hall, and conversion of Pier 76 to public use.HKNA plan In the end, the Mayor ignored the HKNA plan, and proposed to rezone the Western Rail Yard site for commercial and residential development as part of the Hudson Yards. In April 2008, Governor David Paterson decided to renovate the existing Javits building with a severely revised budget of $465 million. The renovation, started in 2010, was led by design team FXFOWLE Epstein, whose redesign of the Javits Center's interior focused on upgrading organization and efficiency, as well as occupant comfort. The more transparent curtain wall, less opaque skylight systems, and light gray paint on the space frame have dramatically transformed the voluminous public spaces. New mechanical systems have improved the indoor air quality, reduced ambient noise, and significantly saved on energy consumption. The diamond-patterned Tuscan red terrazzo of the original floor has been replaced with soft tones of gray terrazzo. A new high-performance curtain wall has simplified and lightened the aesthetics of the original façade by changing the façade's module from to . This allowed for the introduction of more transparent glass with minimal structurally glazed mullions. Solid stainless steel panels replaced the opaque portions of glass to better express the building's functionality. The roof of the new expansion was also made \\"green\\" by the presence of a garden in the new wing's roof. The renovation was completed in November 2013. The expansion was meant to retain old tenants coming back annually, such as the New York Boat Show. In January 2012, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to construct a new convention center on the site of Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens and redevelop the Javits Center site with a mix of commercial space and apartments, similar to Battery Park City. However, Cuomo's plan was quickly scuttled due to disagreements over space in the Aqueduct Racetrack area. More Javits Center renovations are being eyed, with $15 million already going toward a new telephone system and improved Wi-Fi network in the building, as well as a truck idling area to the west and south being proposed for further expansion. The newly expanded Javits Center is served by the New York City Subway at the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, which was built as part of the 7 Subway Extension in anticipation for the adjoining Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project. The station opened on September 13, 2015. The expanded Javits Center, along with the completed High Line, the new Hudson Park and Boulevard, and the subway extension, are facilitating the development of Hudson Yards. In January 2014 it was revealed that the new roof was still leaking after the expansion. In January 2016, Governor Cuomo announced that the Javits Center would be expanded again (to ), at a cost of . Javits North, a \\"semi-permanent structure\\" located at the 40th Street end of the Javits Center, would be demolished and replaced by a new glass building with \\"meeting rooms, new exhibition halls and outdoor space.\\" The further expansion of the Javits Center was proposed in order to help New York State's economy. The consortium chosen is made up of project manager Lend Lease Group and Turner Construction Company, a subsidiary of Hochtief which is controlled by Spanish company ACS Group.

He was a native of Baraboo, Wisconsin. During World War II, he served with Company F, 133rd Infantry Regiment, 34th Infantry Division. Near Cisterna, Italy on May 26, 1944, Newman and his platoon approached a German machine gun emplacement on the Anzio-Nettuno defense line. Newman, scouting ahead of his platoon, remained standing under enemy fire to ascertain the positions of the emplacements. Noting them, he proceeded to lead a machine gun unit from his platoon to a position from which they could open fire on the Germans. However, the fire was ineffective. Newman then single- handedly advanced on the two machine gun nests, wounding two Germans and causing the other two to flee. Three more Germans came rushing forward to another nest, but Newman killed two of them; the third fled. Newman and his platoon took eleven prisoners; Newman himself had destroyed three enemy machine gun emplacements. He was awarded the Medal of Honor by General Order #5 on January 15, 1945. He retired from the service with the rank of captain. He is buried in Remlik, Virginia. He is one of 61 Wisconsinites to be awarded the Medal of Honor, and one of twenty members of the 34th Infantry Division to be so honored.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay Rays, Cleveland Indians, and Miami Marlins. He is known for setting the record for having the most consecutive put-outs without committing an error. High school He was on the 2001 national champion team of Seminole High School in Seminole, Florida. Professional career =Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= The Anaheim Angels selected Kotchman with the thirteenth overall pick in the 2001 MLB draft. In , the Angels moved starter Darin Erstad back to center field, announcing that Kotchman would likely open the season at first base. After struggling in his at-bats early in 2006 because of mononucleosis, Kotchman was placed on the disabled list in early May. In , Kotchman proclaimed himself fully healthy and proved it by winning the Angels' opening day first baseman job for the second straight year. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Kotchman missed 128 games in , as he was kept away from the field with complications stemming from mononucleosis. After a spring in which the Opening Day starting first baseman batted better than .400, he hit just .152 with one home run and six RBI in 29 games with the Angels. Kotchman tried to return to the field, but his rehab assignment was cut short when he experienced dizzy spells in July while playing for Triple-A Salt Lake. He spent much of the rest of the season at home in Florida, performing cardio exercises. In , he was one of seven Angels regulars to hit over .290 (most in majors) and established career highs in several offensive categories including batting average (.296), home runs (11) and RBI (68). He also hit .320 at Angel Stadium and .274 on the road. He had a 7-game hit streak (7-8/31-8/7), his 4th seven-game streak of season (each matching a career-high). He left the June 16 game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 7th after being hit on the helmet by a pickoff throw at second base by Dodgers catcher Russell Martin and was diagnosed with a mild concussion and received three stitches behind his right ear. On June 25, he returned to the starting lineup after missing seven games. He logged the first three triples of his career.

After seven days, the Braves placed Kotchman on the restricted list so he could continue to be with his mother in Florida. Eleven days from first being placed on the bereavement list, the Braves activated Kotchman. On January 31, , Kotchman avoided arbitration and agreed to a one-year, $2.885 million contract. Kotchman mentioned at spring training in 2009 that playing for the Braves was always a dream of his. Kotchman suffered a shin contusion after being hit by a pitch from Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher Max Scherzer on May 31 and was expected to be out two to three days. The injury did, however, force Kotchman on the 15-day disabled list and was activated on June 16. =Boston Red Sox= On July 31, 2009, Kotchman was acquired by the Red Sox in a trade for first baseman Adam LaRoche. In Kotchman's first game with the Red Sox, he hit a two-run home run off of Joba Chamberlain.

Biopace chainrings have a reduced chainring diameter coinciding with the cranks being horizontal. This is supposed to smooth the pedaling action, allowing the rider's feet to carry more momentum through the power stroke, and having it smoothly removed at the bottom of the stroke rather than encouraging riders to push bigger gears and risk knee damage due to higher knee joint loadings. This is different from the design of other oval style chainrings, which have the smaller effective chainring diameter coincide with the cranks being at top and bottom dead centre (TDC and BDC), thus making the crank easier for the rider to turn through BDC for a constant chain tension. By having the chainring at its peak effective diameter with the cranks level, where the rider has maximum leverage over the crank during the power stroke, these designs are supposed to make better use of the rider's power output. Some cyclists find the benefits of Biopace worthwhile, including well-respected bike mechanic Sheldon Brown. Some riders may also value a Biopace crankset for its historical accuracy on a vintage bike, for its novelty value, or even retro-cachet.

Hair extensions are usually clipped, glued, or sewn on natural hair by incorporating additional human or synthetic hair. These methods include tape-in extensions, clip-in or clip-on extensions, fusion method, weaving method, and wigs.  Background  A hair weave is human or artificial hair utilized for the integration with one's natural hair. Weaves can alter one's appearance for long or short periods of time by adding further hair to one's natural hair or by covering the natural hair all together with human or synthetic hairpieces. Weaving additional human or synthetic pieces can enhance one's hair by giving it volume and length, and by adding color without the damage of chemicals or adopting a different hair texture than that of their own. However, hair loss can occur either along the front hairline or above the ears due to the wearing of specific hair styles for a prolonged period of time, such as weaves. Such hair loss in known as traction alopecia. By the late 17th century, wigs in various shapes and sizes became a latest fashion trend. Hair weaves in particular, did not grow interest until the 1950s; even during that time celebrities had been the only ones using them. When the \\"long, disco-haired\\" era evolved there became a widespread use of hair weave. Since that era, hair weave has only become more popular. Most human hair weaves come from Asian countries like India and China. Final product of fully installed human hair weave extensions  Installation method hair extension Pinchbraid extensions were invented in the 1980s. They are individual locks of hair tied into the native hair with a durable upholstery thread. Tape-in hair extensions last from four to eight weeks and the hair can be gently combed and washed while wearing the extensions. In addition, the extensions need to be treated with specialized shampoos, conditioners and styling products to keep them in top condition. The extensions can be easily taken off by applying glue remover and can be easily installed by using liquid adhesive or glue tape. Clip-in weaves, also known as clip-in hair extensions, can be integrated into natural hair to add length and volume. Clip in hair extensions can be purchased for $50 – $1000, depending on the desired quality. The clip in hair extensions most commonly come in as a long strand of one contoured piece that can be cut into multiple layers for creating separate layers on a user's head. When the hair is purchased from a beauty supply store or a specialized online brand, it comes with clips, which are sewn into the hair. It is also possible to buy the hair (in bundles) and the clips separately, the clips can then be sewn on easily by the purchaser or by a stylist. Once the clips are sewn in, the user clips in the hair herself or can visit a stylist, to help create a look that is natural. This technique is the least permanent and lacks the disadvantages such as traction alopecia associated with glue extensions. The hair weft has small toupée clips sewn onto them. Usually a set of clip-in extensions averages eight strips of human hair in varying widths from two inches to eight inches. Starting at the nape of the neck, the hair is sectioned neatly, then the weft is placed onto this section with the clips open and facing the scalp. Each clip is snapped into place. It can be helpful to lightly backcomb each section for a more secure grip. This is repeated until each clip-in weft is in place. Clip-ins can be worn for an entire day; however, some people take them off to sleep. Bonding is a method of weaving that lasts for a shorter period of time in comparison to sew-in weaving. It involves the application of hair glue to a section of wefted hair then onto a person's natural hair; special hair adhesives are used in bonding to prevent damage to one's natural hair. This technique is commonly used and does not cause damage to the hair unless taken out without proper directions from a professional. It is advised that weave bonding be installed for up to 3 weeks because the glue begins to loosen up and lessens the attractiveness of the hair. There are 2 types of bonding methods: soft bond and hard bond. Soft bond is flexible and comfortable to wear and is made using latex/acrylic based adhesives. Hard bond is the industry term for bonding treatments whose adhesive contains cyanoacrylate, or super glue. Hard bond adhesives last longer than soft bond adhesives because it is not water based and therefore less susceptible to deterioration. Nonetheless, the hard bond adhesives are not as comfortable as the soft bond adhesive because they are rigid. These bond attachments generally last 4–6 weeks before a maintenance appointment is necessary. Fusion method involves a machine similar to a hot glue gun used to attach human hair extensions to individual strands of one's natural hair of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch squared sections for a truly authentic look. Another option for fusion attachments is using hair which is pre-tipped with a keratin adhesive. A heat clamp is then used to melt the adhesive to attach the extension hair to the natural hair. Fusion weave allows washing hair frequently and the use of regular hair products such as hair gels. This technique is very time consuming taking 3 or more hours. They need re- positioning every 2–3 months as the natural hair grows. Due to various chemicals in the glue, which may cause hair loss and scalp irritation, combined with heat, this method is more damaging to natural hair. Micro ring (also known as micro-bead or micro loop) hair extensions use small metal rings or beads (usually aluminum) and can sometimes be lined with silicone to attach the extension hair. They are fixed to small sections of natural hair and tightened using a special tool that clamps the bead around the natural hair. The micro-beads are designed to be small enough so that they are not visible in normal use. They need re-positioning every two to three months as the natural hair grows and the micro-beads move away from the scalp. As they do not use heat or adhesives, these hair extensions should cause less damage than some types of extensions, if placed correctly and properly taken care of. Today, there are many sizes available for micro rings/beads from about . The sizing makes a difference on the weight of the extensions, the feel, and the visibility. Some micro-beads are so tiny that they mimic a non surgical hair transplant. The stylist installing the extensions should determine what size micro rings/beads are best for the client's hair length and texture, prior to installation on the head. The glued netting process near completion Netting is a technique which involves braiding natural tresses under a thin, breathable net that serves as a flat surface onto which stylists can weave extensions. This method requires the use of hair net or cap to be placed over the person's hair that has been braided. Netting provides more flexibility than track placement because the stylist is not limited to sewing extensions to a braid. With netting there is the option of sewing the hair wefts onto the net or gluing. This technique is not as time-consuming when compared to the other hair techniques because it takes about 2–4 hours to complete. Section of a lace front used to close a weave (also called a lace or closure) The most recent development in weave extensions are lace fronts, which are made from a nylon mesh material formed into a cap that is then hand-ventilated by knotting single strands of hair into the tiny openings of the cap, giving the hair a more natural and authentic continuity than typical extensions. It has few variations including straight, wavy and curly. Furthermore, the extension units can be woven in or attached to a person's hairline with special adhesives. To ensure a proper fit, head measurements are taken into account with this type of weave. A lace frontal is best placed by a professional since more advanced weaving and hair extensions are used. This method is commonly used because it makes it possible to have access to a certain part of their scalp. Tracking involves the braiding of a person's natural hair. This is one of the most commonly used methods as it is quite fast and lasts considerably longer than other techniques. However, it does not allow for regular hair maintenance. In order to prevent the hair from being bumpy or uneven, the hair is sewn horizontally or vertically across the head from one side to the other starting from the bottom. The braided hair is then sewn down and the hair weft extensions are sewn onto the braids. A weave can consist of a few tracks, or the whole head can be braided for a full head weave. With a full head weave, the braids are sewn down or covered with a net. Extensions are then sewn to the braids. The number of tracks used depends on the desired look.  Types of hair  The most popular and commonly available form of hair is known as premium hair. It is sold in most beauty supply stores or online. The roots and tips of hairs are interwoven in premium hair which causes tangling. This is due to the opposing cuticle layers catching onto one another. However, as it is the most inexpensive type of hair, it is a best seller. Premium hair comes in two types: *Regular premium hair: generally the least expensive type of hair. The cuticles are present in different directions and the hair is prone to tangling. *\\"Tangle-free\\" premium hair: this is obtained by chemically removing the cuticles using an acid bath. This process reduces the friction among hairs, leaving the remaining hair tangle-free. In order to give the appearance of natural healthy hair, a laminate is applied to the hair to give it a shiny and silky look. =Synthetic fiber= Synthetic fibers are made of various different materials and contain no human hair. Synthetic fibers come in weave (weft) and single strands (bulk) for braids. They do not last as long as human hair because they can be easily damaged by friction and heat. The quality of fibers varies greatly. Depending on quality, they may never look like human hair, as they can be stiff and move differently from human hair. Synthetic fibers are much less expensive than human hair. Heating appliances such as curling irons, flat irons, and straightening combs generally should never be used on most types of synthetic hair. There are some newer versions of synthetic fibers that are more resistant, human-like fibers that can be heat processed allowing for heat styling. =Futura= Futura is a type of synthetic fiber that can withstand heat up to 400 °F (200 °C), and can actually outlast human hair. It is very similar to human hair given it is tangle-free and has a natural sheen. It can be straightened or curled, however, it takes longer to set and futura cannot be colored. It is sometimes sold as a human hair blend. =Human hair= The human hair shaft is made up of dead, hard protein, called keratin, in three layers. The inner layer is called the medulla and may not be present. The next layer is the cortex and the outer layer is the cuticle. The cortex makes up the majority of the hair shaft. The cuticle is formed by tightly packed scales in an overlapping structure similar to roof shingles. Most hair-conditioning products attempt to affect the cuticle. There are pigment cells that are distributed throughout the cortex, giving the hair its characteristic color. The cuticle is a hard shingle-like layer of overlapping cells, some five to twelve deep, formed from dead cells that form scales which give the hair shaft strength and protect the inner structure of the hair. The hair cuticle is the first line of defense against all forms of damage; it acts as a protective barrier for the softer inner structures, including the medulla and cortex. A packet of 10-inch premium hair The cuticle is responsible for much of the mechanical strength of the hair fiber. A healthy cuticle is more than just a protective layer, as the cuticle also controls the water content of the fiber. Much of the shine that makes healthy hair so attractive is due to the cuticle. In the hair industry, the only way to obtain the very best hair (with cuticle intact and facing the same direction) is to use the services of \\"hair collectors,\\" who cut the hair directly from people's heads, and bundle it as ponytails. This hair is called virgin cuticle hair, or just cuticle hair. *Hair extensions made of true virgin, raw (cuticle hair) have the most durability and ease of use as the integrity of the hair has not been broken or altered by the method of collection. This continues to be true if this hair is then simply wefted or sewn on a track, without any processed chemical or steamed done on the hair. Human hair industry The selling of human hair for weaves, wigs, and other hair styling products is an industry that generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually and is growing as a large export economy in some Asian countries, such as India, at a rate of 10–30 percent annually. In India, a large portion of the hair is sourced from Hindu temples where hair is donated for religious practices, particularly in honor of the Hindu god Vishnu. This hair is highly sought out for its 'virgin', untreated qualities, as well as its great length. From there the hair is cleaned and the color is removed before being re-dyed for international style tastes. Color, texture and quality =Color= Artificial hair colors: Manufacturers of artificial hair use a standard scale to classify the hair by color. The lower the number on the package, generally, the darker the color. 1 usually denotes darkest black, and would become lighter with increasing number value, ending at the lightest blonde, then finally white. These colors vary greatly from one manufacturer to another, and certain specialty hair suppliers also create their own signature patterns and colors. Human hair colors: Come in an endless variety from platinum blonde to darkest natural black. True raw blonde human hair is scarce and is highly sought after. = Textures of human and artificial hair = Textures of artificial hair vary from very straight to extremely curly, or kinky. The exact names of curl patterns vary by brand, and the possibilities of curl patterns with synthetic hair are endless, but some examples of packaged textures include: *Silky straight - straight and smooth, East Asian like hair. *Yaki - straight, usually mimicking the texture of relaxed Afro- Caribbean hair. *Deep wave - while generally not a true 'wave', it can be made to look like spiral curls/3a hair. *Loose deep wave or romance wave - looser version of the deep wave, softer, more romantic curls. *Kinky curly (very tightly coiled \\"s\\" or \\"z\\" shaped curl pattern ) - often used to recreate the look of natural Afro-Caribbean hair. *Wet and wavy, can be packaged as Spanish wave or Indian wave - usually human hair is used, and is either naturally curly or permanently waved to appear so. Characterized as having soft, natural-looking curls that revert to a curly state when wet, characteristic of South Asian and Latin American hair. Textures of human hair vary from very straight to extremely curly or kinky, and all the naturally occurring textures that are in-between. The exact curl patterns vary by person and so the possibilities of curl patterns with true raw hair are endless. *Coarse or smooth straight - Straight with or without a wave. *Curly wave - similar to the look and feel of spiral curls/3a hair. *Deep wave - looser version of the deep wave. *Kinky curly (very tightly coiled \\"s\\" or \\"z\\" shaped curl pattern ) - It is often used to recreate the look of natural Afro-Caribbean hair. =Hair preparation terminology= * Virgin hair is hair that hasn't been colored or processed in any way and may or may not still be growing from the head. This should include any steam processes. * Raw hair is hair that also has not been colored or processed in any way. This includes steam processes. Some consider this to be less evasive and not actually processed as the raw or virgin undergoes a multiple day steaming process to create long-lasting curls or wave patterns without the damage of chemicals. This process guarantees consistent curls and waves that has a uniform texture. Premium raw or virgin hair has had absolutely no processes of any sort including steam done on the hair. This is essential as true premium raw/virgin hair has a naturally occurring texture that when matched to the owner of the raw/virgin hair extensions creates a look that is unbeatable in look and feel. * Remy hair is the modern spelling of the word 'remis' which was derived from the French verb 'remettre', meaning 'put back'. Its historical meaning is that all hair (human or animal) in any given bundle has been 'put back' to the original direction it grew in (i.e. there were (but are no longer) any 'upside down' (inverted) hair in any given bundle). All hair has been re-aligned root to point (tip). Over time its spelling along with its meaning has changed. Today's 'remy' meaning is that the hair was never inverted in the first place. Rather, it was cut from the donor and kept in its original grown alignment. However, this 'remy' word bears little relevance as to whether a bundle of hair is remy or not due to the majority of factories selling incorrectly labelled products. The hair gets passed on as remy due to most people, including hair professionals, being unable to detect the difference. It requires the ability to feel the cuticles which is a highly skilled and learned technique. The result is that the word 'remy' has gone wayside and if a bundle of hair is labelled as such, in reality it is likely not remy. The production of remy hair preparation requires excess labor and skill. Furthermore, 'remy' hair produced in factories has all been acid treated to remove a large portion of the cuticles. This minimizes tangling leaving the western hair supplier, and eventual client, thinking that it is 'remy', never learning how to feel the cuticles and misguided in general as to the real meaning of the word. * Single drawn or double drawn hair may be produced from any ponytail or group of ponytails. The single drawn bundles will result in only the shortest hairs being removed from the original ponytail. The amount of shortest hairs removed depends upon the hair preparers (workers) instructions. The equipment used is a hackle and not a drawing board (or drawing mat). The single drawn hair bundle will contain a variety of different hair strand lengths, only the very shortest having been removed. It is commonplace in the hair extension industry to call any hair 'single drawn' regardless of whether it has been drawn at all. The quality of the hair itself is irrelevant to the drawing process. It is generally of a lower price bracket than double-drawn hair due to shorter hair still being contained within. * Double drawn indicates the manual hand process of sorting any given amount of hair into its various lengths and later retying accordingly into new bundles. The equipment used is a pair of drawing boards (or drawing mats). The result being that each new bundle formed contains only the same lengths of hair strands. The term 'double' is used because the process involves drawing (pulling out) the hair from drawing boards (or drawing mats) twice. The hair is drawn first in one direction and then afterwards in the other direction. Double drawn hair will have (nearly) as many hair strands at one end as the other and appear much thicker and not wispy at the end. This process is very laborious, and therefore makes the hair very expensive. There are not many articles available to explain this precise procedure due to industry secrecy. It is commonplace in the hair extension industry to call any hair 'double drawn', even when it isn't. It is likely that hair labeled as 'double drawn' has not been drawn at all. Methods of integration A young woman with multi-colored extensions braided into her hair The misnomer of 'tracks' comes from the common, long-lasting method of integrating wefts, known as the 'track and sew' method. The 'tracks' are usually cornrows, braided in the direction of how the hair will fall. Toward the face or away, with or without a part, the tracks build the foundation of how the end result will look. The wefts are then sewn onto the braids, usually with a specially made, blunt-ended needle. The needle can be curved or straight. There are many different colors of specially-made thread to choose from, depending on what color of hair you will be integrating. Darker hair lends to darker thread. When the hair is braided at a high level of tension, the client is at risk for traction alopecia. Wefts may also be bonded directly to the clients hair using special bonding glue. Care must be taken not to bond the wefts directly to the scalp, as it can cause sensitivities in some clients. A patch test is frequently recommended, as per manufacturer's directions. Glue has become less popular since it was discovered that glue can cause severe and often permanent health issues such as headaches, bald spots and dermatitis. The \\"invisible part\\" is a technique used by hair stylists that hides any evidence that the person is wearing an extension. The extension will appear as if it is growing directly from the person's scalp. This look can be achieved with either the sew-in or glue method. This technique allows a long lasting method of attaching commercial hair to the natural hair. Application generally takes about an hour. It will last about 8 weeks. Bulk hair can also be bonded to the hair, using many different methods, from clips to adhesive. In the South East Asian Region, the practical method of lengthening-re-bondage has been in use since the mid-19th century. The lengthening-re-bondage method consists of two treatments. The first treatment consists of re bonding and ironing. The second treatment of lengthening-re bondage involves gentle pulling and tugging of the hair. These two treatments are highly effective in lengthening hair without causing serious damage. Bulk hair can also be added with thread if bonding is not suitable. This may be because the wearer has excessively oily hair or because there is a need to wash hair daily. Adding hair extensions with thread means that damage to the natural hair can be avoided and that the hair extension attachment areas are not vulnerable to external elements like heat, oils and water. Shampooing and styling of integrations Shampooing of artificial hair integrations can be as easy as shampooing real hair, with some considerations. For instance, many manufacturers suggest using a mild shampoo, or even a wig shampoo. Directions included with the integrations may indicate what type of shampoo to use; the methods of brushing, combing and drying that are most advisable; and what heat setting to use when drying the hair, or if it is even advisable to do so. The same care taken when shampooing must also be used when styling artificial hair. It is often recommended that the texture of hair purchased should be the style in which the hair is worn. Using heat to straighten curly hair, or to curl straight hair, damages it. The more damage the hair sustains, the shorter the lifespan of the artificial hair. Most human hair extensions can be treated as real hair, albeit more gently. *Since human hair extensions are usually heavily processed to achieve uniform color and texture, a mild shampoo is recommended, along with a light conditioner to reduce tangling. When shampooing it is suggested that a sulfate and alcohol free product be used, since those contents cause frizz and dry out the hair. Cool water is also recommended when shampooing, to reduce or prevent matting and excessive tangling. Having to remove snarls and tangles loosens the foundation of the integrations and further damages the hair. It is best to shampoo the hair in a top down motion. *An important factor concerning the care of true, raw (remy, virgin) human hair extensions, since this hair has had absolutely no processes, chemical or steam done, is that these extensions are simply human hair and can be simply shampooed or washed as much as desired. Human rights In July 2020 American authorities seized 11.8 tons of natural hair products which had been produced in the Xinjiang re-education camps by slave labor. The products were seized at the border in New York due to the human rights violations associated with their production.

He was a Whig member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Kentucky from 1847 to 1849, and he served as Governor of the Oregon Territory from 1850 to 1853, stepping down after a turbulent term in office. He was the owner of Margaret Garner, whose enslavement and sexual assault is the basis for Toni Morrison's novel, Beloved. Biography =Early life= Gaines was born September 22, 1795 in Augusta County, Virginia, to Abner Gaines and Elizabeth Matthews. His grandfathers and great-grandfather served during the American Revolutionary War. He received an education and studied law, and volunteered in the War of 1812. In 1819, Gaines married Elizabeth Kincaid from KentuckyCorning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History on June 22, 1819. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. He was a lawyer practicing in Boone County, Kentucky, and served as a state legislator in Kentucky during the 1820s and 1830s. =Military= Gaines volunteered and was appointed the rank of Major during the Mexican–American War in 1846. During the war in 1847 he was General Winfield Scott's aide-de- camp. He and some 80 soldiers were captured at Encarnacion in January 1847. They were held captive in Mexico City until August. While a prisoner, he was elected to the 30th United States Congress from Kentucky's 10th Congressional District. He served one term (March 4, 1847 to March 3, 1849) and lost reelection. =Governor of Oregon Territory= He was a supporter of President Zachary Taylor, who was elected in 1848. At the end of his term as congressman he returned to Boone County, and in October 1849 he accepted the position of Governor of the Territory of Oregon. He received the appointment after the positions of territorial secretary and governor were declined by another Taylor supporter, Abraham Lincoln, whose term in Congress had also ended earlier that year.Brown, J. Henry (1892). Political History of Oregon: Provisional Government. The Lewis & Dryden Printing Co.: Portland. p. 124-125 He traveled to Oregon with Territorial Secretary Edward D. Hamilton aboard the sloop Falmouth. From the start, Gaines's tenure in office proved to be difficult. He arrived in the territory by ship, losing two of his daughters to yellow fever at Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. Shortly after arriving in the territory, his wife died in 1851 after falling off a horse. His political life would prove to be just as turbulent. During his tenure in June 1850 he became a member of an Indian Commission set up by the United States government to negotiate treaties with the Native American tribes west of the Cascade Mountains in the territory.SuAnn M. Reddick and Cary C. Collins. Medicine Creek to Fox Island: Cadastral Scams and Contested Domains. Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. 106, No. 3 This commission was created because the Donation Land Act in 1850 allowed citizens to settle up to and the government wanted the lands west of the Cascades for settlement and to move the tribes to Eastern Oregon. However, Gaines and his fellow commissioners Alonzo A. Skinner and Beverly S. Allen were only able to get treaties signed that allowed the tribes to remain on the west side and in the foothills of the Willamette Valley. The commission ratified 19 treaties and was then disbanded in February 1851. His tenure was marked with fierce partisanship, facing opposition from the press and the Democratic-controlled territorial legislature. Gaines unsuccessfully tried to keep the territorial capital at Oregon City. The governor also pushed for other Whig policies that were often at odds with popular sentiment. These unpopular positions, coupled with fierce partisanship, cemented a perception that Gaines was an Easterner, out of touch with Pacific Coast needs and attitudes. In 1853, Gaines left office, succeeded by the Democrat Joseph Lane, who assumed the reins of government for three days. Undeterred by the past hostilities of the Oregon electorate, he chose to stay, remarrying and settling on a farm just outside Salem. His second marriage was to Margaret B. Wands in 1853. In 1854 he and two of his sons (Archibald and Abner) drove over a herd of over 200 head from Kentucky and Arkansas across the plains to Oregon, including 35 purebred Durham, in order to help start a beef cattle industry in Oregon. = Slave owner = In 1825 Gaines purchased a plantation called Maplewood in Kentucky. Around a dozen enslaved persons worked this plantation, including the mother of Margaret Kite Gaines, who was born in 1833. Aged five or six, Margaret was put to work in Gaines' house, where her duties involved looking after his children. In 1849 Gaines permitted her to marry Robert Garner, whose owner, James Marshall, occupied a neighboring plantation. In 1849 Gaines left Kentucky to become governor of the Oregon Territory, and therefore sold Maplewood and its enslaved residents to his younger brother Archibald Gaines. In 1856 Margaret, her husband and four children escaped to Cincinnati, but a posse quickly tracked them down. As they were surrounded, Margaret tried to kill herself and her children (successfully killing her two-year-old daughter), rather than be returned to slavery. Garner's life inspired Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. =Later life= Gaines ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1855, but lost to Lane.Lansing, Ronald B. 2005. Nimrod: Courts, Claims, and Killing on the Oregon Frontier. Pullman: Washington State University Press. p. 266. Governor Gaines' appointment to the governorship indirectly lead to the death of several of his family, including his daughters Harriet and Florella, who died in 1850. In 1851 his wife Elizabeth went for a ride on the Clatsop plains and was thrown from her horse, which had become frightened by a wagon. Mrs. Gaines was crushed beneath the wagon's wheels and died from the injuries she sustained.Hubert Howe Bancroft, History of Oregon: Volume II, 1848-1888. San Francisco, CA: The History Company, 1888; pg. 159, fn. 36. After this tragedy his remaining children were sent back to relatives in the East. About 15 months after his wife's death, Gaines remarried, joining in matrimony with Margaret B. Wands, one of five schoolteachers recently sent to the state. John P. Gaines died December 9, 1857 and is interred in the Old Pioneer Cemetery at Salem, Oregon.

In her native Nigeria she is best remembered for starring in Lux commercials and Bisi, Daughter of the River, as well as her own series, The Patti Boulaye Show.Patti Boulaye Bio Her stage name is said to have been inspired by the actress Evelyn \\"Boo\\" Laye. Early life Boulaye was born after her mother went into labour in a taxi that was passing through two towns in Mid-Western Nigeria and was raised in a strict Catholic household with nine children, including airline pilot Tony Ebigwei, who was killed in the Nigerian Airways plane crash of 1978. She is of Igbo origin.Lewis, Ros (3 June 2016), \\"Patti Boulaye: ‘My mother hid up to 30 people at a time in our house’\\", The Guardian. As a teenager Boulaye survived the 1967–70 Biafran war and attributes this to her strong faith. At the age of 16 she left Nigeria for the United Kingdom where she decided to become a nun but, during a sightseeing trip in London, Boulaye stood in a queue for, what she assumed, was Madame Tussauds but turned out to be an audition for the original London production of Hair and soon won a part, which launched her career in musicals. Her father, who did not approve of showbusiness, disowned his daughter but later forgave her. Career =Stage= After Hair, she featured in The Two Gentlemen of Verona, but landed her first starring role as Yum Yum in The Black Mikado under her birth name, Patricia Ebigwei.Lane, Terry (25 November 2001), \\"The Black Mikado (1975)\\" , A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography. Retrieved 23 November 2009. Critic Tony Lane wrote: \\"Patricia Ebigwei's version of 'The Sun whose rays...' is, in the words of the Gramophone reviewer of this recording, the performance against which all others must now be judged. It is one of those remarkable interpretations that makes (sic) all others pale and unsatisfactory by comparison. No G and S lover is unmoved by this sensational piece of music making. Her version is a slow, erotic, languid ballad of vanity and sexual self-satisfaction that makes the conventional renditions seem prissy and just plain silly.\\" Other stage productions she has starred in include the title role in Carmen Jones (at London's Old Vic Theatre, in a production directed by Simon Callow) and Jesus Christ Superstar. In 2003 Boulaye launched her West End musical, Sun Dance, which took twelve years to put together.

The Guardian was later forced to pay £15,000 in damages. She defended fellow Conservative Jeffrey Archer after he made alleged derogatory comments about black Britons. During a radio interview, he stated: \\"[Three decades ago], your head did not turn if a black woman passed because they were badly dressed, probably overweight and probably had a lousy job.\\" Boulaye defended Archer, stating: \\"I am talking as a black woman who knows Jeffrey Archer very well ... and he is not a racist. I think he would make a very good mayor.\\" Personal life A devout Roman Catholic, Boulaye has two children and a grandson with husband Stephen Komlosy.

G. Burkett, a Vietnam veteran, and Glenna Whitley, an investigative journalist. It reveals that numerous people claiming to have been mentally injured by serving in the Vietnam War never served there. In addition, it reveals persons who were mistakenly given military awards. It won the Colby Award for military writers in 2000. Contents Stolen Valor is in 4 parts, with appendices. Part I, \\"The Image\\", begins with a chapter about author B.G. Burkett's time in the U.S. Army. The next four chapters detail the author's argument that the image of the Vietnam veteran was tarnished by a combination of media coverage, veteran imposters, U.S. citizens' anger against the draft, and a perception of the veteran as a victim. Part II, \\"The Trauma of War\\", looks into the diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Vietnam veterans, and how it has been treated by the Veterans' Administration. It also explores accusations against Vietnam veterans of war atrocities. The authors explore the effects of Vietnam War veteran imposters on the image of the Vietnam veteran. They contend that the news media inadequately investigated some persons claiming to be veterans and attributing such problems as homelessness to the aftermath of the war. Part III, \\"Stolen Valor\\", describes individuals wearing Vietnam War medals, ribbons and badges although they had not earned them. Using the Freedom of Information Act, the authors retrieved records of people who claimed they served in Vietnam and received awards. The book denounces those whose records do not match their claims; examples include William Northrop and Frank Dux. The authors also attempt to counter claims that African-American soldiers were overly represented among the war's casualties. Part IV, \\"Victims and Heroes\\", the authors discuss what they characterize as myths about the effects of Agent Orange. They profile individual pilots who flew Agent Orange delivery missions in Vietnam without negative health effects. The authors criticize Vietnam Veterans of America, referring to them as \\"Vietnam Victims of America.\\" The appendices provide lists of recipients of the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross, and of U.S. military prisoners of war who survived their captivity.  Reception  Burkett pictured with Congressman John Salazar and Stolen Valor US Senator Jim Webb praised Stolen Valor, calling it \\"one the most courageous books of the decade\\". The book received the Colby Award for military writers in 2000. It is believed to have contributed to Congressional passage of the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, which made it a crime for an individual to falsely claim to have been awarded military medals. In 1999, Mackubin Thomas Owens, a Marine infantry veteran of Vietnam, praised the book and Burkett, saying, concluding, \\"Mr. Burkett has done an immense service to his fellow veterans, and by extension to his country\\". In 2004, Dave Curry from Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) responded to the criticism of VVAW in the book. In a scathing review, he said the book displayed political partisanship, made \\"errors in research methodology\\" and misleading statements about Winter Soldier Investigation participants, and denigrated the experiences and motives of veterans who subsequently opposed the war. In 2008, psychiatrist Paul R. McHugh listed Stolen Valor as one of the five best books on \\"the factions and follies of psychiatry.\\" He cited Burkett's efforts to uncover fraudulent PTSD claims. A 2009 article in Columbia Journalism Review discussed how Stolen Valor exposed the media's gullibility in failing to fact-check people who claimed military service and awards. It concluded that \\"no reporter who reads it will ever again crank out a Veterans Day feature without making an effort to verify the subject’s claims first\\".

Slone is an award-winning fine artist. Slone was born in 1974 in Newton-in-Furness, Lancashire, a northern English town. Slone is self-taught. Slone would spend his formative years roaming the countryside of England where his lifelong love of art was born. Richard would eventually pursue an offer to become a boxer under the guidance of boxing great Joe Frazier, who guided Richard's boxing career until Slone's love for art forced him from the boxing canvas, and onto the canvas upon an easel. Slone's art has become popular with notable collectors including Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner, Glenn Schaeffer, Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and many more. His work has graced the covers of many magazines, including the Ring Magazine, KO Magazine, World Boxing Magazine and many more. His work has been used by many companies and advertising agencies, including Everlast. He is the Official Artist of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, a title he has held since the age of 23. In 2007 Slone's artwork was used by the Ultimate Fighting Championship UFC to create a clothing line named 'Ultimate'. The line consisted of limited edition clothing with Slone's artwork printed on the garments. Slone has painted portraits of people including Nelson Mandela, Hugh Hefner, Donald Trump and Lennox Lewis. He has also painted fighters from the UFC, including a landscape of Chuck Liddell entitled 'The Iceman Cometh', and a landscape of Andrei Arlovski vs. Paul Buentello, which was originally painted as two separate portraits but pieced together and made into an official licensed UFC poster. He is currently working on a huge oil portrait for rap star Eminem. In 2005 international art investors bought an entire series of Slone originals. The interest and demand in his art in recent years has been phenomenal, the Art company was formed in 2005 and two art dealers were brought in to cater to Slone's rapidly growing clientele. Slone paints with great detail, bold colors and often uses Acrylic and Enamels. In 2007 Foxwoods Casino and Resort commissioned Slone to paint their 100th boxing event. Slone also signed a multi-year deal with National Geographic/Hampton Brown who will publish some of his work. In 2010 Slone was selected to paint the Official artwork for Bafana Bafana, the South African football team for the 2010 Fifa World Cup. His artwork has been used on the official posters and programs for most major boxing events in the last 15 years, including Mayweather vs Pacquiao, Canelo vs Golovkin and Mayweather vs McGregor.

It is a part of the Network Rail Strategic Route 5, SRS 05.07 and is classified as a secondary line. It is used by a variety of inter- regional and local passenger services from East Anglia to the West Midlands and North West, as well as freight and infrastructure traffic; it also links with the busy East Coast Main Line at its western end. Fenland District council (the area's primary local authority) put forward their Rail Development Strategy for the route in 2012, which includes infrastructure upgrades for the intermediate stations, improved frequencies for the services using it (e.g. doubling the Birmingham New Street to Stansted Airport service to half-hourly and the Ipswich to Peterborough service to hourly) and establishing a Community Rail Partnership for the line in 2013/14. History The line was originally opened by the Eastern Counties Railway company in 1847, linking the ECR mainline from London via and Ely to and with Peterborough. Trains initially terminated and started from , though a link to the Great Northern Railway's station was subsequently built to allow through running to the Midland Railway line to and the GNR main line to the north. Onward travel was also possible over two London and North Western Railway lines from Peterborough, to and whilst March would soon become a very busy junction with the opening of branches to via Wisbech and Cambridge via St Ives (both by the ECR) in 1847/8 and the GNR route to in 1867. The latter two were subsequently jointly vested in the GER and GNR in 1879. Many of the branches fell victim to the Beeching Axe in the early to mid 1960s, as did Peterborough East and several of the intermediate stations. The March–Spalding line also closed in 1982 with the rundown of the marshalling yard at Whitemoor, leaving only the original main line in operation. Service A freight train at March Passenger services are provided by CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway and Greater Anglia. To the west most trains continue beyond Peterborough to either Leicester and Birmingham New Street (via the Birmingham–Peterborough line), or to Nottingham, Sheffield, Manchester Piccadilly and . To the east most trains continue beyond Ely to Norwich or to Cambridge and Stansted Airport (joining in one direction or in the other the Cambridge–Norwich \\"Breckland\\" line) or to . Connections are available for stations to at Ely. Services used to run between London and Peterborough but these services were dropped in 2010. The line is used extensively by freight trains from the Port of Felixstowe to the West Midlands, North West and Scotland, as it forms part of the Felixstowe to rail freight corridor that is being upgraded by Network Rail to allow more rail-borne freight from the port to be diverted away from the London area. Infrastructure The line is double track throughout, has a loading gauge of W10 and a line speed of 40–75 mph. Apart from short stretches at each end, the line is not electrified.

The Born approximation is named after Max Born who proposed this approximation in early days of quantum theory development. It is the perturbation method applied to scattering by an extended body. It is accurate if the scattered field is small compared to the incident field on the scatterer. For example, the scattering of radio waves by a light styrofoam column can be approximated by assuming that each part of the plastic is polarized by the same electric field that would be present at that point without the column, and then calculating the scattering as a radiation integral over that polarization distribution. Born approximation to the Lippmann–Schwinger equation The Lippmann–Schwinger equation for the scattering state \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle with a momentum p and out-going (+) or in-going (−) boundary conditions is :\\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle = \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\circ}}\\\\rangle + G^\\\\circ(E_p \\\\pm i\\\\epsilon) V \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle, where G^\\\\circ is the free particle Green's function, \\\\epsilon is a positive infinitesimal quantity, and V the interaction potential. \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\circ}}\\\\rangle is the corresponding free scattering solution sometimes called the incident field. The factor \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle on the right hand side is sometimes called the driving field. Within the Born approximation, the above equation is expressed as :\\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle = \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\circ}}\\\\rangle + G^\\\\circ(E_p \\\\pm i\\\\epsilon) V \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\circ}}\\\\rangle, which is much easier to solve since the right hand side no longer depends on the unknown state \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle. The obtained solution is the starting point of the Born series. =Born approximation to the scattering amplitude= Using the outgoing free Green's function for a particle with mass m in coordinate space, : G^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf r, \\\\mathbf r')=-\\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\frac{e^{+ik\\\\mathbf r-\\\\mathbf r'}}{4\\\\pi\\\\mathbf r-\\\\mathbf r'} one can extract the Born approximation to the scattering amplitude from the Born approximation to the Lippmann–Schwinger equation above, : f_\\\\mathrm{Born}(\\\\theta)=-\\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int d^3r e^{i\\\\mathbf q\\\\mathbf r}V(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\;, where \\\\mathbf q is the transferred momentum.  Applications  The Born approximation is used in several different physical contexts. In neutron scattering, the first-order Born approximation is almost always adequate, except for neutron optical phenomena like internal total reflection in a neutron guide, or grazing-incidence small- angle scattering. The Born approximation has also been used to calculate conductivity in bilayer graphene and to approximate the propagation of long- wavelength waves in elastic media. The same ideas have also been applied to studying the movements of seismic waves through the Earth.  Distorted-wave Born approximation  The Born approximation is simplest when the incident waves \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\circ}}\\\\rangle are plane waves. That is, the scatterer is treated as a perturbation to free space or to a homogeneous medium. In the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), the incident waves are solutions \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{1}}^{(\\\\pm)}\\\\rangle to a part V^1 of the problem V=V^1 + V^2 that is treated by some other method, either analytical or numerical. The interaction of interest V is treated as a perturbation V^2 to some system V^1 that can be solved by some other method. For nuclear reactions, numerical optical model waves are used. For scattering of charged particles by charged particles, analytic solutions for coulomb scattering are used. This gives the non-Born preliminary equation :\\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{1}}^{(\\\\pm)}\\\\rangle = \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\circ}}\\\\rangle + G^\\\\circ(E_p \\\\pm i0) V^{1} \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{1}}^{(\\\\pm)}\\\\rangle and the Born approximation :\\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{(\\\\pm)}}\\\\rangle = \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{1}}^{(\\\\pm)}\\\\rangle + G^1(E_p \\\\pm i0) V^{2} \\\\vert{\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{1}}^{(\\\\pm)}\\\\rangle. Other applications include bremsstrahlung and the photoelectric effect. For a charged-particle-induced direct nuclear reaction, the procedure is used twice. There are similar methods that do not use the Born approximations. In condensed-matter research, DWBA is used to analyze grazing-incidence small-angle scattering.

Directed by Pete Docter and Roger L. Gould, it is the first Pixar short to use dialogue and the first to take characters and situations from a previously established work. The short premiered on September 17, 2002, included in the DVD and VHS release of Monsters, Inc. It was nominated for a 2002 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Plot Mike is obsessed with his new six-wheel drive car, and happily insists on showing it off to Sulley. Unfortunately for Mike, anything that can go wrong does. Sulley plays with the adjustable power seat until an annoyed Mike snaps at him to stop. Mike starts the engine and hears the seatbelt reminder tone sound off. Although Sulley manages to get his seatbelt on easily, Mike finds his seatbelt stuck and accidentally locks himself out of the car while falling out trying to unstick it. Mike instructs Sulley to push a button so he can get back in. Sulley, confused by the massive amount of buttons on the dashboard, pushes the one that opens the hood. When Mike goes over to close it, he is unable to reach it. Sulley helps him close the hood but accidentally closes it on Mike's fingers, which causes him to scream in pain. Sulley helps Mike get free only to trap him in the engine compartment completely. Mike calls Sulley on his cell phone and instructs him to open the hood again. When he does this, Mike manages to escape. Upon re-entering the car, he is exasperated by the continuous seatbelt reminder tone. Mike manages to put his seat-belt on, but the windshield wipers get turned on, much to his frustration. As Sulley tries to help, Mike tells him not to touch anything and decides to do it himself. Mike pushes a button that launches the entire car into chaotic malfunction, including Latin conga music playing loudly on the car's stereo system. (Jerry the Seven Finger Monster appears in this scene looking at the car then runs away.) Mike finally ends the chaos by pulling the key out of the ignition, but then Sulley adds insult to injury by accidentally breaking the rearview mirror in an attempt to realign it. Now at his wit's end, Mike forces Sulley out of the car and speeds away, destroying the car completely. Sulley mutters, \\"Huh, that's weird, the airbag didn't go off.\\" Right as he finishes saying this, the airbag inflates, and its force sends Mike flying back up the street. Sulley catches Mike, who mourns his old car before agreeing to walk with Sulley to work during the closing credits which plays a calmer version of the Monsters Inc. theme.

This usage tends not to include effects such as quantum noise in optical communication, which is studied in the sub-branch of coherence theory.  Principle  Physical optics is also the name of an approximation commonly used in optics, electrical engineering and applied physics. In this context, it is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores wave effects, and full wave electromagnetism, which is a precise theory. The word \\"physical\\" means that it is more physical than geometric or ray optics and not that it is an exact physical theory. This approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then integrating that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the Born approximation, in that the details of the problem are treated as a perturbation. In optics, it is a standard way of estimating diffraction effects. In radio, this approximation is used to estimate some effects that resemble optical effects. It models several interference, diffraction and polarization effects but not the dependence of diffraction on polarization. Since this is a high-frequency approximation, it is often more accurate in optics than for radio. In optics, it typically consists of integrating ray- estimated field over a lens, mirror or aperture to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. In radar scattering it usually means taking the current that would be found on a tangent plane of similar material as the current at each point on the front, i. e. the geometrically illuminated part, of a scatterer. Current on the shadowed parts is taken as zero. The approximate scattered field is then obtained by an integral over these approximate currents. This is useful for bodies with large smooth convex shapes and for lossy (low-reflection) surfaces. The ray-optics field or current is generally not accurate near edges or shadow boundaries, unless supplemented by diffraction and creeping wave calculations. The standard theory of physical optics has some defects in the evaluation of scattered fields, leading to decreased accuracy away from the specular direction. An improved theory introduced in 2004 gives exact solutions to problems involving wave diffraction by conducting scatterers.
