He is sometimes referred to as Michelangelo Colonna. Biography He was born in Rovenna. As a boy in Como, he worked with a painter by the name of Caprera. By 1617, he travelled to Bologna to apprentice with Gabriello Ferrantino or il Occhiale, and then the early quadratura master, Girolamo Curti, called il Dentone. He painted frescoes for the Palazzo Albergati in Bologna. He would have been known by the biographer of Bolognese artists, Cesare Malvasia, for whom Colonna frescoed the Villa Malvasia in Trebbo in 1624, along with Curti and Domenico Ambrogi. The following year, Curti and Colonna frescoed parts of the Villa Paleotti (now Villa Monari-Sard√®). Also in 1625, along with Ambrogi, he carried out frescoes in the Villa Malvezzi-Campeggi in Bagnarola and after being recommended by Alessandro Tiarini, he helped to decorate the ceiling of the church of Sant'Alessandro in Parma. In 1625, he collaborated with Lucio Massari, Francesco Gessi and others in the decoration of the Oratory of San Rocco in Bologna, painting six of the saints and allegories. In 1627, he painted in San Michele in Bosco. After Curti died in 1632, Colonna began a long collaboration with the skilled quadratura painter Agostino Mitelli until 1660. Together they contributed to the decorations of the Palazzo Spada in Rome, and then painted in the Pitti Palace in Florence, including a large fresco of the 'Fame of the Medici crowned by Glory'.In the section encompassed by the Museo degli Argenti Angelo Michele Colonna, Gloria of Saint Lawrence, column of the Archangel Michael They became the pre-eminent quadratura fresco painters of northern Italy with Colonna principally executing the figurative elements and Mitelli, the quadratura or illusionistic architectural frameworks: in Modena, they painted in the Este palace at Sassuolo;The courtyard frescoes have deteriorated they executed the ceiling of the now destroyed Oratorio de San Girolamo of Rimini; in 1657 they carried out the decoration of the chapel of the Rosary in the basilica of San Domenico in Bologna, including a framed 'Assumption of the Virgin'; and between 1653-8, they painted the gallery leading to the High Altar of San Michele in Bosco. In 1658, Colonna left Italy to go to Spain to work for Philip IV of Spain; he had initially been contracted for this work by Diego Vel√°zquez. He was to return to Italy in 1662, where his collaborator now was Mitelli's pupil, Giacomo Alboresi (1632‚Äì1677). He continued to be prolific in Bologna, decorating the Palazzo Cospi-Ferreti, Bologna and a chapel in the church of San Bartolomeo (1667). In 1677, he completed frescoes for the Council Hall of the Palazzo Comunale or town hall of Bologna, working with Gioacchino Pizzoli. Giuseppe Romani was one of his apprentices. Colonna died at Bologna in 1687.

The Type 92 is a light machine gun and not to be confused with the similarly named Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun. Description It was the standard hand-held machine gun in multi-place IJN aircraft during the most part of the Pacific War. It proved to be seriously inadequate. Aircraft produced in the later part of the conflict often were equipped with weapons such as Type 1 and Type 2 machine guns or Type 99 cannon. Essentially a copy of the shroudless post- World War I aircraft-mounted version of the British Lewis gun, the Type 92 was fed with a 97-round drum magazine and used on a flexible mount. It was chambered in a Japanese copy of the .303 British cartridge. The main external difference between the two models was the trigger guard, and cooling fins around the barrel and gas piston tube. Neither the post-World War I British aircraft Lewis nor the Japanese copy featured the distinctive thick barrel shroud of the original gun (although ground-based versions generally retained it). It was removed as it was found that the airflow past the aircraft was sufficient for cooling the barrel and eliminating the shroud reduced the mass.

Joe is the Director of RiverTunes Music Camp and a Co-Director of the Wintergrass Youth Academy. He plays a wide variety of string instruments, including fiddle, mandolin, ukulele, tres, cavaquinio, balaliaka, as well as a world of percussion, including anything he can get his hands on, such as a pickling jar, a credit card, or a jawbone. Craven is a well known sight at acoustic music festivals and, for many years, was violinist and percussionist for the David Grisman Quintet. Craven lists some of his influences being Jimi Hendrix, dumpster diving, Hermeto Pascoal, thrift stores, Frank Zappa, educator and aesthetician John Dewey, beachcombing, Carl Stalling, Eddie Palmieri, field recordings, Tiny Moore, Los Pleneros De Viente Uno, Darol Anger and The Horseflies. Joe Craven has played with many notable musicians including Jerry Garcia, Stephane Grappelli, Alison Brown, Rob Ickes and David Lindley. He performs solo and in different sizes and versions of his own projects, most notably The Joe Craven Trio. Craven's noted instrument ability is matched only by his creativity. He finds rhythm and unique sound in almost any object. A favorite \\"instrument\\" of his is any small, plastic trash that can turned upside down and played with either brushes or his own hands. Craven's collection of percussion instruments (found sound and ones designed for the purpose) is vast and includes examples from around the world. Along with Joe's concert and festival performing, he is highly regarded for his work with school children, university students and communities in general. His workshops are as much about finding the \\"voice\\" we all have as they are about music. The kids attending these school assemblies and classes often come away with a better sense of self and their value in the world around them. Self-esteem building via music and humor is what this part of Joe's work is all about. The value of his work with children has serious positive results. Craven's \\"free child\\" seems to be heard by every student attending his workshops, even the ones who claim to be \\"too cool\\" to bother. The western regional arm (FARWest) of Folk Alliance International (formerly known as the North American Folk Music & Dance Alliance) awarded Joe its highest honor \\"Best of The West\\" for 2009. Previous recipients have included The Kingston Trio, Rosalie Sorrels, U. Utah Phillips, and Lowen & Navarro. The award announcement was made in July 2009.

Only specific import goods such as alcohol, tobacco, perfumes, cosmetics, cars and petroleum products have associated taxes. For companies, there is a 17.5% corporate tax, which is lower than international standards. Shoppers reportedly spend over US$5.2 billion a month in Hong Kong shops. Hong Kong's proximity to manufacturing plants in China, as well as its status as a free port, allow it to sell and transport a wide variety of goods. There are few restrictions on merchandise vending, and therefore items such as realistic toy weapons are available. The two main shopping seasons are at Christmas and the Chinese New Year. The region is unique in the sense that it is official languages are both Cantonese and English, which enables a healthy tourist trade with English-speaking customers as bilingual sales tags and salespeople are common, especially in tourist areas. The MTR subway and effective taxi service also facilitate Hong Kong's busy shopping industry.  Overview  Hong Kong is the fifth largest exporter of jewellery in the world, mainly in the supply of jade and gold, and the second largest exporter of custom jewellery. Chow Seng Seng and Luk Fook are among the more well-known local jewellery chains. A variety of cuisines are available in Hong Kong; the Soho area in Central is the centre for Western foods, while traditional Chinese cuisines including Shanghainese, Hanainanese, and Cantonese are widely available. Street vendors or hawkers selling local snacks such as dumplings and snake soup can be found in Mong Kok and Causeway Bay. Custom tailoring is popular and affordable in Hong Kong. Customers can draw out a design for clothing and have it made in a few days. Modern fashion is sold in the Times Square, IFC, and Elements shopping malls, while leather goods are available in Tsim Sha Tsui. Fa Yuen Street and the Ladies Market (Â•≥‰∫∫Ë°ó) on Tung Choi Street in Mong Kok, as well as Jardine‚Äôs Crescent in Causeway Bay, are known for the availability of low-priced clothing and accessories. Electronics from Japan and Europe are available for example in Apliu Street and the Golden Shopping Center in Sham Shui Po. There are computer appliances centers in Wan Chai, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, and Causeway Bay. Japanese culture has become popular in Hong Kong, with Japanese department stores such as Sogo, Yata, and Muji operating. Japanese clothing brands like Swordfish, Moussy, and Uniqlo have also opened flagship stores in the city. Stanley Market sells a variety of inexpensive goods, particularly souvenirs. Antiques can be found on Upper Lascar Row and Hollywood Road, which are popular with tourists. History During its early colonial period, Hong Kong served as a port that sold far more than it consumed. Goods were mostly sold via mobile hawking or independent traders, with the majority of trade, utilities, shipping, and manufacturing handled by major business houses known as hongs. The establishment of banks and deposit institutions allowed people to accumulate savings. The economy underwent an upturn in the 1960s, which led to the opening of several shopping centres. Two of the first modern shopping centres were Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui and The Landmark in Central, above the MTR station. Daimaru led a trend of Japanese exports into Hong Kong in 1966 and Deng Xiaoping's 1978 Open Door Policy made Hong Kong the definitive gateway to China. As the economy improved during the 1970s and 80s, there was increasing demand for luxury goods, such as air conditioning. In 1984, Cityplaza in Taikoo Shing was redeveloped. A large architectural project at the time was also undertaken to connect Ocean Centre to the Harbour City shopping mall in Tsim Sha Tsui. Many large shopping centres were also built in the new towns, including Tuen Mun Town Plaza, New Town Plaza, and Tai Po Mega Mall. The large mall construction movement continued into the 1990s with Pacific Place, Dragon Centre, Time Square, Plaza Hollywood and Festival Walk.

The tribe is of North Arabian stock, tracing its lineage to Adnan through Hawazin, and its original homeland was the border area between Nejd and Hejaz in Khurmah and Ranyah. Although the Banu 'Amir were engaged in a long war with the Quraysh before the appearance of Islam, the tribe was characterized by giving late allegiance to Muhammad and his immediate successors. the tribe produced several well-known Arabic poets, the most famous of whom was Labid ibn Rabi'ah, an author of one of the Seven Hanged Poems. Other poets included 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl, an important tribal chief; al-Ra'i al-Numayri, an opponent of Jarir; and the female poet Layla al- Akhyaliyyah. The protagonists of the romantic saga of Layla wal Majnun, Qays and Layla, also belonged to Banu 'Amir.  Branches  A genealogy of the tribes branching from Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah. The main tribes that constituted this confederation were as follows: * Banu Kilab - The descendants of Kilab ibn Rab'iah ibn 'Amir ibn Sa'sa' ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Bakr ibn Hawazin. A Bedouin tribe that lived in western Nejd and who led the Banu 'Amir confederation prior to Islam. Like other Amiri tribes, they were allied with the eastern Arabian Qarmatian movement, then came to dominate central Arabia after the Qartmatian's demise. Later the tribe migrated northwards to Syria and briefly established the Mirdasid dynasty there. The tribe seems to have settled and dispersed among the native population there during the Mameluke period. * Banu Numayr - a mostly Bedouin tribe that lived on the western borders of al-Yamamah and were allied with the Umayyad dynasty. They left for the banks of the Euphrates river in Iraq after a 9th-century Abbasid military campaign against them in al-Yamama. * Banu Ka'b - this section was the largest of the Bani 'Amir, and was divided into four tribes: Banu Uqayl, Banu Ja'dah, Banu Qushayr, and Al Harish. All were native to al-Yamamah, particularly the southern regions of that district, and included both bedouin pastoralists and settled agriculturists. Of the four, Banu Uqayl was by far the largest and most powerful. Having left for northern Iraq in the late Abbasid era, the bedouins of Banu Uqayl established the Uqaylid dynasty in Mosul (5th Islamic century). Later, sections of the tribe returned to Arabia, settling in the Province of Bahrain where they gave rise to the Usfurid and Jabrid dynasties. Several tribal groups in Iraq originated from Uqayl, including Khafajah, Ubadah and al-Muntafiq. Other sections of Kaab left al-Yamamah and Nejd at a later date and settled along both sides of the Persian Gulf. They are now known as Bani Kaab and mostly live in the Ahwaz region of Iran and UAE and iraq. * Banu Hilal - probably the most well-known Amirid tribe, they were enlisted by the Fatimid rulers of Egypt in the 11th century, and left for Upper Egypt before invading North Africa in what later became a celebrated saga in the Arab World. In 1535, the Banu Amir ruler Ibn Radwan collaborated with Spain in an attack on the city of Tlemcen. The project was to replace the ruler of Tlemcen Sultan Muhammad by Ibn Radwan's younger brother Abdulla. They were opposed by the Banu Rashid tribes under Sultan Muhammad, and the Spanish forces were besieged at the Tibda fortress and exterminated, except for 70 prisoners.A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period by Jamil M. Abun-Nasr p.153ff In addition to the Uqaylid tribes of Iraq, the modern tribes of Subay', the Suhool in Nejd, and some sections of Bani Khalid trace their lineage to Banu 'Amir.  Military campaigns during Prophet Muhammad's era  The tribe was involved in military conflict with Muhammad. Four months after the Uhud battle, a delegation of Banu Amir came to Muhammad and presented him with a gift. Abu Bara stayed in Medina. Muhammad declined to accept that gift because it was from a polytheist and asked Abu Bara to embrace Islam. He requested Muhammad to send some Muslims to the people of Najd to call them to Islam. At first, Muhammad was quite apprehensive of this, as he feared that some harm might befall on these Muslim missionaries. On Muhammad‚Äôs hesitation, Abu Bara guaranteed the safety of the emissaries of Muhammad. Mubarakpuri, The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet, pp. 352. The Muslim scholar Tabari describes the event as follows: Ibn Ishaq's Biography claims that forty men were sent to them; but Sahih al-Bukhari states that there were seventy ‚Äî Al-Mundhir bin ‚ÄòAmr, one of Banu Sa‚Äòida, nicknamed ‚ÄòFreed to die‚Äô ‚Äî commanded that group, who were the best and most learned in the Qur'an and jurisprudence.

Magnus Gustaf Blix (25 December 1849 ‚Äì 14 February 1904) was a Swedish physiologist born in the parish S√§br√•, presently located in H√§rn√∂sand Municipality. He is the grandfather of UN weapons inspector Hans Blix. During his career he was a professor at the Universities of Uppsala and Lund. Blix was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892. Blix is best known for his work in the 1880s involving somatic sensation. He discovered that electrical stimulation on different points on the surface of the skin caused distinct warm or cool sensations. Subsequently he built a \\"temperature stimulator\\" which showed that a decreased skin temperature produced cool sensations from localized spots at separate skin locations. He also discovered that increased temperature induced warm sensations from different cutaneous locations. In addition he performed tests that involved localized tactile sensitivity. In 1881‚Äì82 Blix published his findings in two important documents. During this time frame, German neurologist Alfred Goldscheider (1858‚Äì1935), and American physician Henry Herbert Donaldson (1857‚Äì1938) of Johns Hopkins University were performing similar experiments, independent of Blix.

Urban agglomerations have certain powers that would ordinarily be exercised by individual municipalities. Definition The Act respecting the exercise of certain municipal powers in certain urban agglomerations defines the expression urban agglomeration as follows. :An urban agglomeration corresponds to the territory, as it exists on 17 December 2004, of Ville de Montr√©al, Ville de Qu√©bec, Ville de Longueuil, Ville de Mont-Laurier, Ville de La Tuque, Municipalit√© des √éles-de-la-Madeleine, Ville de Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Ville de Mont-Tremblant, Ville de Cookshire-Eaton, Ville de Rivi√®re-Rouge or Ville de Sainte-Marguerite‚ÄìEst√©rel. One municipality in each agglomeration is known as the central municipality and has special status under the Act. The others are called related municipalities. The Act defines the powers exercised by the agglomeration and those exercised by the reconstituted municipalities, known as agglomeration powers (comp√©tences d'agglom√©ration) and local powers (comp√©tences de proximit√©). Agglomeration councils Agglomeration powers are exercised by agglomeration councils (conseils d'agglom√©ration). Agglomeration powers These are defined by statute. Many governmental functions are performed by the central city in each agglomeration; for example, the Montreal city police (SPVM) have jurisdiction in the neighboring communities.

The combination of unit of measurement and the physical quantity (height) is called metres above mean sea level in the metric system, while in United States customary and imperial units it would be called feet above mean sea level. Mean sea levels are affected by climate change and other factors and change over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.  Uses  Metres above sea level is the standard measurement of the elevation or altitude of: * Geographic locations such as towns, mountains and other landmarks. * The top of buildings and other structures. * Flying objects such as airplanes or helicopters.  How it is determined  The elevation or altitude in metres above sea level of a location, object, or point can be determined in a number of ways. The most common include: * Global Navigation Satellite System (like GPS), which determines a location in reference to multiple satellites. * Altimeters. They typically measure atmospheric pressure, which decreases as altitude increases. * Stereoscopy in aerial photography. * Surveying, especially levelling. Accurate measurement of historical mean sea levels is complex. Land mass subsidence (as occurs naturally in some islands) can give the appearance of rising sea levels. Conversely, markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a lowering of mean sea level.  Other measurement systems  Feet above sea level is the most common analogue for metres above sea level in the US customary measurement system, abbreviated FAMSL.  Abbreviations  Often, just the abbreviation MSL is used, e.g. 8848 m MSL. Metres above sea level is commonly abbreviated mamsl or MAMSL, based on the abbreviation AMSL for \\"above mean sea level\\". Other abbreviations are m.a.s.l. and MASL.

She then died in New York, and her husband moved to Illinois. The company did not pay the policy, and he sued in Illinois. The Illinois court passed judgment against the insurance company. The insurance company appealed saying that the suit should not have been filed in Illinois. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the general rule that simple contract debts, such as a policy of insurance not under seal, are, for the purpose of founding administration, assets where the debtor resides, without regard to the place where the policy is found. Side effect of the case The plaintiff, Stephen E. Woodworth, was both the Step-Father and Uncle of noted entomologist Charles W. Woodworth. C.W.

Federal Aviation Administration. Updated 15 Oct 2008. Bend is home to Epic Aircraft and X-Air. Airline flights use Roberts Field in Redmond, Oregon, about north of Bend. Most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, but this airport is BDN to the FAA and has no IATA code (IATA assigned BDN to Talhar Airport in Badin, Pakistan). History Covering about , Bend Municipal Airport traces its history to 1942. A group of Bend citizens banded together to deed a small piece of farmland to the City of Bend for a municipal landing strip. The site was developed and used for pilot training through World War II. After the war, the airstrip was maintained by the City of Bend for civil use; it slowly grew during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1979, development of an Airport Master Plan was undertaken. This plan established the direction for development at the airport and forecast significant growth in activity at the Bend Airport. This Master Plan, however, was completed while General Aviation was booming across the country. A downturn in the general economy affected General Aviation in the 1980s and through the early 1990s and the forecast growth did not materialize. That changed by the late 1990s, and General Aviation began a resurgence that continues today, along with increased business and corporate aviation travel to Bend. Bend Municipal Airport is poised to be the General Aviation and Corporate Aviation gateway to Central Oregon. Continued development of Epic Aircraft, Leading Edge Aviation, Precise Flight, and other growing tenants on the Airport have made an aviation business park of the Bend Airport. More than eighteen aviation related businesses on the airport employ more than 1000 people, making the Bend Municipal Airport one of the largest concentrations of family-wage jobs in the Bend area. Over the next several years, a number of improvements are planned, including an Airport Master Plan Update and development of a full east side parallel taxiway, as well as more than of general aviation and corporate aviation facilities.  Facilities Bend Municipal Airport covers at an elevation of . Its one runway, 16/34, is asphalt and has 2 parallel taxiways. Bend Municipal Airport is identified as a Category 2, High Activity Business and General Aviation airport by the Oregon Department of Aviation. In the year ending June 24, 2008, the airport had 50,100 aircraft operations, average 137 per day: 98% general aviation, 2% air taxi, and <1% military. 199 aircraft were then based at this airport: 80% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, 2% jet, 4% helicopter, 4% glider and 2% ultralight.

The robbery was committed by Loomis vault supervisor David Scott Ghantt, his married girlfriend Kelly Campbell (a former Loomis co-worker), Steven Eugene Chambers (a one-time FBI informant), his wife Michelle Chambers, Michael Gobbies, and four other co-conspirators. An FBI criminal investigation ultimately resulted in the arrest and conviction of eight people directly involved in the heist, as well as sixteen others who had indirectly helped them, and the recovery of approximately 88% of the stolen money. This robbery was the second-largest cash robbery on U.S. soil at the time, as only seven months earlier, on March 29, 1997 in Jacksonville, Florida, Phillip Noel Johnson stole $18.8 million from the Loomis Fargo armored vehicle he was driving.\\"F.B.I. Finds Armored Car Cash\\" The New York Times, September 19, 1997. Company Although the history of the predecessor Wells Fargo & Company dates back to 1852, Loomis Fargo & Company was established in 1997 by the consolidation of Wells Fargo Armored Service and Loomis Armored Inc.; the resulting corporation employed 8,500 people and provided armored transportation, cash handling services, and automatic teller machine maintenance.\\"Wells Fargo and Loomis forming armored car company\\", The New York Times, July 16, 1996. Its Charlotte office would be the victim of David Scott Ghantt and his confederates later that year. Planning David Ghantt struck up a relationship with fellow Loomis Fargo employee Kelly Campbell, and they continued to maintain contact even after Campbell left the company. In August 1997, Campbell informed Ghantt of an old high school friend of hers, Steve Chambers, who could assist Ghantt in executing a massive cash robbery of the Loomis Fargo vault in one night. Chambers had broached the possibility of a robbery to Campbell earlier in the summer. The plan was for Ghantt to commit the robbery and then quickly leave the country for Mexico ‚Äì but to leave the bulk of the cash with Chambers. Chambers would then occasionally wire Ghantt money and see to his basic financial needs; when \\"the heat was off,\\" Ghantt was to re-enter the U.S. and the money would be split up among all of the co-conspirators. Heist With the plan in place, Ghantt sent home early (reportedly, at 6 p.m.) a newly hired employee who had been assigned to train with him. He then proceeded to load about $17.3 million in cash (approximately $11 million of which was in $20 bills) into the back of a company van. Outside of the building, Ghantt met up with Campbell, Chambers, and others who were involved in plot, and drove off to a printing business called Reynolds & Reynolds in northwest Charlotte. From there, the money was moved from the company vehicle to private vehicles. Then, keeping with the plan, Ghantt took $50,000 (the maximum that could by law be taken across the border without further authorization) with him and left for Mexico, winding up at the popular Yucatan Peninsula resort-island of Cozumel.  FBI investigation = Ghantt as the prime suspect = Loomis Fargo employees could not open the vault the next morning and called the police. The police then called the FBI because most of the money handled at the facility belonged to banks, which technically made it a bank robbery ‚Äî a federal offense. Investigators considered Ghantt to be the prime suspect almost from the beginning. He was the only employee unaccounted for the next morning, and videotapes recovered at the Loomis Fargo Charlotte office showed Ghantt removing \\"cubes of cash\\" and loading it into a Loomis Fargo armored van for over an hour. Two days later, when the FBI found the Loomis Fargo armored van, they discovered almost $3.3 million in cash left in the back of the van; it was later discovered that the thieves had miscalculated the sheer bulk of the small denomination currency, and that they simply left the cash that they could not take with them in the back of the van. Investigators also found Ghantt's pickup truck, abandoned at the warehouse. Inside the truck, they found Ghantt's ring and surmised this was a sign of Ghantt's intention to end his relationship with his wife. Although the FBI investigation was able to quickly connect Ghantt to Campbell, connecting Ghantt to Chambers was a more difficult task. Tips had led the FBI to begin monitoring Chambers' (and his wife's) activities, but it was not until the FBI recorded a phone call from Ghantt in Mexico that the final connection was made. By then, the FBI had become greatly concerned for Ghantt's personal safety; they had learned that Chambers had plotted to have Ghantt killed in a murder for hire scheme using a \\"hit man\\" named Michael McKinney. The FBI investigation was aided by the gang's extravagant spending. They had initially agreed to control their spending for a year or two, in the belief that the government would vigorously track the spending habits of any and all suspects for at least a year before relenting. Chambers had no intention of following those rules, believing the FBI would never connect him to Ghantt. He and his wife, Michelle, moved from their mobile home in Lincoln County to a luxury house in the wealthy Cramer Mountain section of Cramerton. They kept several furnishings from the previous owners, including a painting of Elvis Presley on black velvet. They also bought a BMW Z3 with cash and made several large purchases, including a $600 cigar store Indian. Campbell used part of her share of the money to buy a Toyota Sienna minivan in two cash installments. An additional tip reached the FBI when Michelle Chambers made a large deposit at a bank. She had previously been making frequent small deposits to avert suspicion. But after one visit, she asked a teller \\"How much can I deposit before you have to report it to the feds?\\" followed by \\"Don't worry, it is not drug money,\\" the bank filled out a suspicious activity report, which ultimately reached the FBI. Ghantt's spending in Mexico was extravagant at first. He had stayed in a luxury hotel and paid for expensive food and activities such as scuba diving and parasailing. Ghantt reported to Chambers that his supply of money was running low, but Chambers sent Ghantt just $8,000. Ghantt, in order to conserve this money, curtailed his spending. He also took various measures to change his appearance, such as shaving, after a patron at a restaurant pointed out to him that he \\"looked like the man who robbed a bank of $20 million.\\" =Arrests, trials, and convictions= After successfully tracing Ghantt's phone call, FBI agents and Mexican police arrested Ghantt on March 1, 1998, at Playa del Carmen, a city near Cancun. The next day, Steve and Michelle Chambers, Kelly Campbell, and four others were arrested. On March 12, a Charlotte grand jury indicted the eight co-conspirators for bank larceny and money laundering; the latter offense was included because of how they spent the stolen money. Nine other relatives and friends were also charged with money laundering, as they had co-signed for safe deposit boxes used to store some of the money; prosecutors opted to charge them on the grounds that they should have known the money was obtained illegally. On similar grounds, four other people were ultimately also charged with money laundering. All but one of the defendants pleaded guilty. They received sentences ranging from probation for several relatives to 11 years and three months in federal prison for Steve Chambers, who was also fined more than $3,500,000. The only defendant to not plead guilty, Chambers' attorney Jeff Guller, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to eight years in prison. By comparison, Ghantt served seven years in prison and fined $USD26,000. He was released in 2006. Michelle Chambers received a harsher sentence than Ghantt ‚Äî seven years and eight months ‚Äî because she had violated several bond conditions. The defendants were the targets of many barbed jokes in Charlotte and across the country, in part because of their extravagant spending. For a time, it was nicknamed \\"the hillbilly heist\\" because nearly all of the major players in the case came from small towns around Charlotte. It was later confirmed by the FBI that more than 88% of the stolen cash had been located or otherwise accounted for. More than 2 million dollars is still missing to this day. =Chambers released from prison= Steven Chambers finished serving his sentence in November 2006. In February 2009 the Associated Press reported that Chambers had chosen to describe himself as \\"changed\\".

It was written by Tom Scharpling and Daniel Dratch, and directed by Randall Zisk. The episode guest starred John Turturro, who accepted to play Ambrose after Shalhoub's invitation. When the episode first aired in the United States on the USA Network on January 23, 2004, it was watched by 5.9 million viewers. \\"Mr. Monk and the Three Pies\\" was generally well received by critics, with most of the praise regarding Turturro's performance. It also led Turturro to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  Plot  At a fair in Tewkesbury, a woman wins a cherry pie, and Pat van Ranken (Holt McCallany) kills her and steals her car. While Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) dismisses it as a carjacking gone wrong, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) remains suspicious. Later, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) gets a call from Monk's brother Ambrose (John Turturro), an agoraphobic who has not left his house for thirty-two years. The brothers have not spoken for seven years‚ÄîAdrian is angry at Ambrose because he never called or wrote after Adrian's wife Trudy died. Ambrose calls Adrian, as he suspects his neighbor, van Ranken, of murdering his wife, Rita (Crystal Santos). Ambrose heard gunshots and noticed van Ranken was gone all night. When asked, van Ranken said Rita had flown to Argentina and that his truck was broken. However, Adrian notices the truck has been moved recently. Adrian and Sharona visit van Ranken, on the pretext of taking back a bag of flour that Rita borrowed from Ambrose, and van Ranken lies about his wife's whereabouts. The next day, van Ranken wins another cherry pie, and Adrian and Sharona see him rooting it. Ambrose remembers that Rita baked three cherry pies to give away at the fair, deducing that there must be something in one of them worth killing for. Though skeptical, Stottlemeyer admits there was no pie in the car when the police got there. However, the airline records confirm that Rita boarded a plane to Argentina on the night of the murder. The next day, Adrian and Sharona track van Ranken back to the fair again, and the third pie is won by van Ranken. Adrian explains that when van Ranken was disposing of his wife's corpse, a woman arrived to collect the pies. Van Ranken realized that one of the shell casings from his gun was nowhere to be found, believing it landed in one of the pies. It convinces Stottlemeyer to search the third pie, but nothing is found inside it. Later, over dinner with Ambrose, Adrian berates him for not calling after Trudy died, and Ambrose, taken aback, says the reason he did not call was because he felt guilty: Trudy was running an errand to get cough medicine for him when she was killed, and he blames himself. He breaks down crying, and Adrian, shocked, tells him it was not his fault and embraces him. Later, Adrian and van Ranken each reenact the murder, realizing that the shell casing is in the bag of flour in Ambrose's house. Adrian and Sharona race to Tewkesbury, realizing that Ambrose is in danger. Van Ranken tries to get the flour back, but Ambrose sees through his ruse. He locks the door, causing van Ranken to set the house on fire. While Sharona calls the fire department, Adrian rushes inside and pulls Ambrose to safety. Meanwhile, Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray- Stanford) arrest van Ranken; they just found Rita's body, and the \\"Rita van Ranken\\" who flew to Argentina is actually his girlfriend. Ambrose gives Stottlemeyer the last shell casing, having found it in the flour, and the reconciled brothers visit Trudy's grave. Production \\"Mr. Monk and the Three Pies\\" was co-written by Tom Scharpling and Daniel Dratch, and directed by Randall Zisk. The episode guest starred John Turturro as Ambrose Monk. Shalhoub and Turturro, \\"longtime friends\\", according to USA Today, had graduated from Yale School of Drama. They had previously worked on the 1991 film Barton Fink and in a 1998 off-Broadway production of the play Waiting for Godot. Shalhoub also lived with the Turturros while working on an East Coast project. As one of the executive producers of Monk by time, Shalhoub personally contacted Turturro. Turturro was also encouraged to the take the role by his family; he declared, \\"My whole family likes the show. My (13-year- old) son likes the show.\\" After they sent off the episode's script to him and his acceptance, Turturro, who Shalhoub thought \\"liked the sound of the character,\\" worked with the series \\"for about four or five days\\", as Shalhoub cannot precisely remember. Ambrose was added to further reveal Monk's backstory; Shalhoub commented, \\"We wanted to use this as a vehicle to get us into more backstory for Monk, to explore where Monk comes from, his family situation - and we thought that this brother character would be a good place to start.\\" While noted \\"Monk shows more emotion than usual because of the family tie\\", Shalhoub also remarked the fact that he is angry with his brother was a good way to show \\"a whole other part of [Adrian]. He's more abrupt and less sympathetic. It's a healthy thing to see that he's not a complete saint.\\" Turturro, by his turn, said \\"The [episode's] tone is oddly touching. It's hard to find the right tone. Tony does a great job of that, mixing comedy and drama\\". Shalhoub was \\"really gratified\\" for Turturro's performance, while Turturro called the episode \\"a pleasure\\" to do. Responding to a question about the possible return of Ambrose, Shalhoub \\"would love to see that character come back,\\" and Turturro would accept it, \\"especially if I don't have to have a complete emotional breakdown.\\" He became a recurring character and returned for \\"Mr. Monk Goes Home Again\\" and \\"Mr. Monk's 100th Case\\". Reception Turturro's guest starring in the episode was praised by critics, and led Turturro to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. \\"Mr. Monk and the Three Pies\\" was first broadcast in the United States on the USA Network at 10 pm EST on January 23, 2004. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by an estimated number of 5.9 million viewers and had a 4.5 household rating. Shalhoub elected the episode among his favorites twice; he put it along with \\"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\\" and \\"Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike\\" during the Monk Cast Favorites Marathon, and mentioned \\"Mr. Monk and the Three Pies\\", \\"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\\" and \\"Mr. Monk Is Someone Else\\" as his favorite ones as the end of the series. Schram also selected it to be her favorite episode, attributing the choice to dynamic between Shalhoub and Turturro. Austin Smith from the New York Post wrote that it is \\"one of the finest episodes of a TV show you're likely to see all year in 2004\\". DigitallyObsessed's reviewer Rich Rosell called it \\"one of the series' best-written episodes\\", remarking \\"Turturro and Shalhoub are excellent together\\". Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk appointed it as his \\"absolute favorite episode (of the entire series!)\\", saying Turturro side-by- side with Shalhoub is \\"stunning.\\" Robinson added that Ambrose \\"makes Monk look like a normal person\\", saying of the story: \\"it's diabolically fun to watch these two neurotic brothers solve a murder mystery.\\" It was said that \\"the comedy here has more than a hint of pathos\\" by People, with the writer declaring \\"It's rare to see brothers portrayed so convincingly, particularly on a show in the field of light entertainment. But don't be afraid: The episode has moments that are funny, pure and simple.\\" Writing for The Star- Ledger, Alan Sepinwall compared the murder that conducts the plot to Rear Windows plot; although stated that \\"Plot has never been the series' strong suit\\", he declared \\"this one's fun in its own right\\". The real reason to watch it, however, \\"is to see Shalhoub and Turturro get on each other's nerves, and to witness Monk revisiting his childhood home\\", according to Sepinwall. The Sydney Morning Heralds Michael Idato called Turturro \\"a great addition to the dynamic\\" and appreciated the possibility of his return later in the series. At the 56th Primetime Emmy Awards, Turturro won the award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his acting as Ambrose on the episode.

The system can be thought of as two separate groups: the M and N antigens are at one location on the ECM and S, s, and U are on a closely related location. The two groups are very closely located together on chromosome 4 and are inherited as a haplotype. The MN blood group The MN blood group in humans is under the control of a pair of co-dominant alleles, LM and LN. Most people in the Inuit population are M/M, while this genotype is rare among Aborigines. In fact, they tend to possess the opposite genotype (N/N). The MN blood group system is under the control of an autosomal locus found on chromosome 4, with two alleles designated LM and LN. The blood type is due to a glycoprotein present on the surface of red blood cells, which behaves as a native antigen. Phenotypic expression at this locus is codominant because an individual may exhibit either one or both antigenic substances. Frequencies of the two alleles vary widely among human populations.Ralph H. Kathan and Anthony Adamany. 1967. Comparison of Human MM, NN, and MN Blood Group Antigens. The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 242, 1736-1722. M+ and N+ RBCs are common (75% of population) and M+N+ cells are the most common genotype (50% of population). These antigens were an early discovery and are some of the oldest blood antigens known after the ABO system. They were first described by Karl Landsteiner and Philip Levine in 1927. Anti-M and anti-N antibodies are usually IgM and are rarely associated with transfusion reactions. Anti-N is sometimes seen in dialysis patients due to cross-reactions with the residual formaldehyde from sterilizing the equipment. This is usually irrelevant for transfusion since this variant of the antibody does not react at body temperature. The U and Ss groups: an overview The S antigen is relatively common (~55% of the population) and the s antigen is very common (~89% of the population). Anti-S and anti-s can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn. The U antigen is a high incidence antigen, occurring in more than 99.9% of the population. The U was originally short for \\"Universal\\", though this is not the case. U negative RBCs can be found in people of African descent. This mutation in red cell surface structure also makes the RBCs S- and s-. Anti-U has been associated with both hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Other MNS antigens The other 41 identified antigens in the MNS group are low incidence, such as He (0.8% of the population) or high incidence, such as ENa (>99.9% of the population).  MNS glycoproteins and genes  Antigens of the MNS system are located on one of two glycoproteins: glycophorin A (GPA, CD235A) and glycophorin B (GPB, CD235B).Roback JD et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda: AABB Press, 2008. Each glycoprotein crosses the membrane once and has an external N-terminal domain (varying in length from 44 amino acids for GPB to 72 amino acids in length for GPA) as well as a C-terminal cytosolic domain (GPB, 8 amino acids in length; GPA, 36 amino acids in length).  MNS antibodies  * MNS antibodies display dosage (they react stronger against cells which are homozygous vs heterozygous for the antigen in question). * Anti-M and anti-N antibodies are naturally occurring, cold- reacting IgM-class antibodies.Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago: ASCP Press, 2009. * Anti-M and anti-N are generally clinically insignificant. * Anti-S, anti-s and anti-U antibodies are acquired following exposure (via pregnancy or past transfusion with blood products) and are warm-reacting IgG-class antibodies. * Anti-S, anti-s and anti-U are usually clinically significant.

It was found that differential binding of transcription factors early growth response 1 (EGR1) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) to the SNP rs5751348 genomic region with the different genotypes in the A4GALT gene leads to differential activation of A4GALT expression, leading to two genotypes: P1 and P2.  P1PK phenotypes  P1PK phenotypes are defined by reactivity to antibodies to anti-P1, anti-P, anti-Pk anti-PP1Pk. and anti- NOR antibodies. * P1 Phenotype: anti-P1 (+), anti-P (+) and anti-PP1Pk (+) and anti-Pk (-).Found in 95% of Blacks and 80% of Caucasians and 30% in Japanese. * P2 Phenotype: anti-P1 (-), anti-P (+), antiPP1Pk (+), and anti-Pk (-). Found in 5% of Blacks and 20% of Whites. * Rare p phenotype (absence of P1PK antigens caused by null mutations in A4GALT): anti-P1 (-), anti-P (-), anti- PP1Pk (-), and anti-Pk (-). These individuals have a very strong anti-PP1Pk which can be associated with delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and early spontaneous abortions or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Currently, 34 alterations, in 37 alleles, in the A4GALT gene have been found to abolish the enzyme activity, giving rise to the rare p phenotype. * The rare NOR phenotype is caused by the presence of unique NOR1 and NOR2 glycosphingolipid antigens, terminating with GalŒ±1 ‚Üí 4GalNAcŒ≤1. Such structure, found only in Rana ridibunda, is a result of mutation in the A4GALT gene, leading to p.Q211E substitution in Gb3/CD77 synthase (rs397514502).  P1PK antibodies  * Anti-P1 titers are often elevated in patients with liver flukes (fascioliasis), hydatid cyst disease and who are frequently exposed to birds (which may have P1-like substances in their excrement). * Anti-P1Pk is composed of a mixture of anti-GLOB, anti-P1 and antiPk in the serum of p individuals. Alloanti-GLOB is seen in the sera of P1k and P2k persons and is naturally occurring and predominantly IgM isotype (but may also be a mixture of IgM and IgG). The antibodies are capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (if IgG isotype and therefore capable of crossing the placenta). There is a relationship between anti-PP1Pk and early spontaneous abortion (the placenta is rich in Pk and GLOB antigens which are targeted by IgG isotype antibodies). * Anti-NOR antibodies occur naturally in most individuals. They react with NOR1 and NOR2 antigens, causing a phenomenon called NOR polyagglutination. = Antibody detection = Anti-P1Pk antibodies are not usually detected with routine laboratory methods. It is possible to detect them using the Donath-Landsteiner test. This test is performed on 2 vials of blood at two different temperatures: 4 ¬∞C and 37 ¬∞C (body temperature). A test is interpreted as positive only after a patient's red blood cells have been incubated at both temperatures and subsequently hemolyzedMais DD.

There are 19 known Lutheran antigens. All of these antigena arise from variations in a gene called BCAM (basal cell adhesion molecule). The system is based on the expression of two codominant alleles, designated Lua and Lub. The antigens Aua and Aub, known as the Auberger antigens, were once thought to make up a separate blood group but were later shown to be Lutheran antigens arising from variations in the BCAM gene. The phenotypes Lu(a+b‚àí) and Lu(a+b+) are found at various frequencies within populations. The Lu(a‚àíb+) phenotype is the most common in all populations, whereas the Lu(a‚àíb‚àí) phenotype is uncommon. Though present in the fetus, it is seldom the cause of erythroblastosis fetalis or of transfusion reactions. Notes Category:Blood antigen systems Category:Transfusion medicine ","title":"Lutheran antigen system"},{"id":"10397786","text":"The Lewis antigen system is a human blood group system. It is based upon two genes on chromosome 19: FUT3, or Lewis gene; and FUT2, or Secretor gene. Both genes are expressed in glandular epithelia. FUT2 has a dominant allele which codes for an enzyme (designated Se) and a recessive allele which does not produce a functional enzyme (designated se). Similarly, FUT3 has a functional dominant allele (Le) and a non-functional recessive allele (le). The proteins produced by the FUT2 and FUT3 genes modify type I oligosaccharide chains to create Lewis antigens. These oligosaccharide chains are similar to the type II chains of the ABO blood system, with a single bond in a different position. The link between the Lewis blood group and secretion of the ABO blood group antigens was possibly the first example of multiple effects of a human gene: the same enzyme (fucosyltransferase2) which converts the Le-a antigen to Le-b is also responsible for the presence of soluble A, B and H antigens in bodily fluids. There are two main types of Lewis antigens, Lewis a (Le-a) and Lewis b (Le-b). There are three common phenotypes: Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le(a-b-).Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Bethesda: ASCP Press, 2008. The enzyme fucosyltransferase 3 (FUT3), encoded by Le gene, adds a fucose to the precursor oligosaccharide substrate, converting it to the Le-a antigen. People who have the Le allele and who are non- secretors (homozygous for the nonfunctional se allele) will express the Le-a antigen in their bodily fluids and on their erythrocytes. If a person has both the Le and Se alleles, their exocrine cells will also have the enzyme fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2). This adds fucose to the oligosaccharide precursor in a different position from the FUT3 enzyme. This produces the Le-b antigen. In most people having both Le and Se, it is difficult to detect the antigen Le-a. This is because the activity of the FUT2 enzyme is more efficient than the FUT3 enzyme, so the type I oligosaccharide chain is mostly converted into Le-b instead of Le-a. Therefore, people with readily detectable Lewis-a antigen are non-secretors; they do not have FUT2 activity. Lewis-b antigen is found only in secretors: people who possess the Se allele and thus have FUT2 activity. Lewis negative people (Le a-, Le b-) are homozygous for the recessive le allele and can be either secretors or non-secretors.  Distribution of Lewis antigens  Lewis antigens are expressed on the surface of red blood cells, endothelium, kidney, genitourinary and gastrointestinal epithelium.Issitt PD, Anstee DJ. Applied Blood Group Serology. 4th Ed. Durham, NC: Montgomery Scientific Publications, 1998. Lewis antigens are red blood cell antigens which are not produced by the cell itself. Instead, Lewis antigens are components of exocrine epithelial secretions, and are subsequently adsorbed onto the surface of the red cell.  Genetics/phenotypes  The three above-stated common Lewis phenotypes represent the presence or absence of Lewis and Secretor enzymes. Le(a+b-) individuals have at least one functional Lewis gene (Le) but are homozygous for nonfunctional Secretor alleles (sese). Thus, these individuals synthesize and secrete Le(a) antigen but lack Le(b) and type 1 chain ABH.Roback JD et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda: AABB Press, 2008. Le(a-b+) individuals inherit both Le and Se alleles, leading to the synthesis of Le(a), Le(b), and type 1 chain ABH. Most type 1 chain precursor is converted to Le(b), therefore these individuals appear as if they are Le(a-). Le(a+b+) phenotype is transiently observed in infants (Secretor activity increases with age). This phenotype is also encountered in 16% of Japanese individuals (who inherit a weak Secretor gene- Se(w)). In absence of a functional Lewis gene (lele), neither Le(a) nor Le(b) are synthesized, leading to the Le(a-b-) phenotype. This phenotype is more common in persons of African descent.  Lewis-related genes = Oligosaccharide precursors = Two precursor oligosaccharides exist, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is found in secretions and in the serum. Type 2 is found exclusively on the surface of red blood cells. No type 1 oligosaccharide is found on RBCs. Unbranched type 1 and 2 oligosaccharides represent i antigen. Branched type 1 and 2 oligosaccharides are I antigens. In neonates, i antigen oligosaccharides predominate (high in cord blood samples). Oligosaccharide branching increases with age, thus adults have mostly I antigen. = Background on ABO blood group system = The H gene of the ABO system encodes a fucosyltransferase that adds fucose to type 2 precursor substances on the surface of RBCs to make H antigen. The h allele is an amorphic form of the gene. If no further modifications are made to the H antigen, the person is type O. When the A gene product acts on the H antigen and adds an N-acetylgalactosamine, the A antigen results and the person is type A. When the B gene product acts on the H antigen to add a galactose, the B antigen results and the person is type B. = The Le gene = The Le gene encodes a fucosyltransferase that adds fucose to type 1 precursor substance (both free in serum and in secretions) to make the Le(a) antigen. The le gene is an amorph. The Lewis antigen produced on free type 1 precursor substance passively adsorbs onto the surfaces or red blood cells. = The Se gene = The Se gene encodes a fucosyltransferase that adds fucose to type 1 precursor generating H antigen. After this step, the Le gene product (FUT3) can add another fucose producing Le(b) antigen. Thus, individuals with the Le gene but no Se gene will have red blood cells bearing only the passively-adsorbed Le(a) but no Le(b). Individuals with both the Le gene and the Se gene will have red blood cells bearing only the passively adsorbed Le(b) and no Le(a). Individuals with no Le gene have neither Le(a) nor Le(b). In addition, the Se gene product is responsible for the presence of A, B and H substances in secretions.  Lewis antibodies  Lewis antibodies are naturally occurring antibodies, almost always IgM type, found almost exclusively in Le(a-b-) individuals. Lewis antibodies may include a mixture of anti-Le(a), anti-Le(b) and anti-Le(a+).  Transfusion medicine practice  Lewis antibodies are almost always clinically insignificant because: * transfused red cells shed their Lewis antigens and acquire the Lewis phenotype of the recipient * Lewis antibodies are quickly adsorbed by free serum Lewis antigens, Therefore, it is not necessary to transfuse antigen-negative blood components for most patients. Lewis antibodies are generally reactive at room temperature and only occasionally at 37 C and AHG phase (antihuman globulin). Lewis antibodies are not a cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), as stated below. = Lewis antigens and antibodies neonates/pregnant women = Lewis antigens cannot be reliably detected until the 2nd birthday. Lewis antibodies in a pregnant woman are essentially totally insignificant because they are IgM subtype (don't cross the placenta) and Lewis antigen is weakly expressed during pregnancy (Lewis Le(a-b-) phenotype is commonly seen during gestation). Most newborns will type as Le(a-b-). Lewis antigen is often decreased on RBCs during pregnancy with some women transiently typing as Le(a-b-). This is thought to be due in part to increased circulating plasma volume in pregnancy and increased lipoprotein.  Disease associations  The Le(b) and H antigens are receptors for the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative bacterium that can cause gastritis and has been implicated in peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoma (or mucosal associated lymphatic tissue lymphoma ‚Äì MALToma) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Le(b) and type 1 H antigens are also receptors for Norwalk virus (common cause of acute gastroenteritis). The Le(a-b-) phenotype is associated with an increased susceptibility to infections by Candida and uropathogenic Escherichia coli. In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and not harbouring a functional Lewis enzyme (Lea-b- genotype: 7%‚Äì10% of the population), levels of CA 19-9 are typically undetectable or below 1.0 U/ml.

Early life The second son of Henry Long (1564‚Äì1612) and Rebecca Bailey, Long was educated at Lincoln's Inn. He had inherited no land at his father's death, but when his elder brother Henry died in 1621, he inherited the extensive but heavily encumbered family estates. On 26 December 1621 he married Mary Coxe (died 1631) and by 1623 his debts had increased alarmingly. With the assistance of his father-in-law he obtained a seat for Salisbury in the 1625 Parliament, possibly as a means to avoid his creditors. He was elected to Parliament in 1626 as Knight of the Shire for Wiltshire.  Parliamentary career  Long was a vocal supporter of the remonstrance defending the House of Commons against the charge of unparliamentary proceedings, and played an active part in supporting Pembroke's attack on the Duke of Buckingham. In several speeches he questioned the duke's Protestantism and implied that the duke was involved in precipitating the death of James I. In an attempt to prevent Long's return to Parliament in 1628, the crown picked him as High Sheriff of Wiltshire, but nevertheless he managed to secure a seat for Bath in Somerset, arguing on tentative legal grounds that since the constituency lay outside his county, he was not breaking the law. His continuing opposition to Buckingham finally resulted in his prosecution in October 1628 in a Star Chamber suit, and it was argued that Long had not only acted unlawfully in securing his election but also neglected his duties as Sheriff of Wiltshire. Hoping to avoid censure, Long quickly withdrew to Wiltshire but returned to Parliament for the 1629 session. In the tumultuous scenes on 2 March, he took a leading part when the Speaker, John Finch, was forcibly held down in his chair, preventing adjournment of the House. Together with six others, he was arrested for offences committed within the House and appeared before the King's Bench, while simultaneously facing ongoing Star Chamber proceedings concerning his shrievalty. Attempts by his counsel and sympathetic friends to secure his release were unsuccessful, despite his appeals for clemency. Initially he agreed to be bound over, but he retracted on learning that the other prisoners had refused to be bailed. He was fined 2000 marks and imprisoned in the Tower until his release in 1633, by which time his first wife had died. That year he married secondly, Anne Foxe (n√©e Cage; died 1665). To pay his fine, Long was forced to sell much of his Wiltshire property, living for most of the 1630s on the Shropshire estates of his second wife. In December 1641 he was elected to the Long Parliament as member for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, and a sympathetic Parliament voted him ¬£5,000 as an indemnity, \\"for his damages, losses, imprisonments and sufferings.\\" However he was exempted from the Royal Pardon in November the following year because of his continuing opposition to the court, and particularly the writ of ship money.  Civil War  Long took an active part in Parliament's cause during the civil war and after being severely wounded at the Battle of Edgehill, he raised a troop of horse and helped to organise Parliamentary forces in Wiltshire and Shropshire. He was Chief Register in Chancery but as a prominent member of the Presbyterian faction in the House of Commons, he acquired a degree of notoriety and he twice assaulted members who disputed his views. In 1647 Long was one of eleven Presbyterian members the army sought to remove from Parliament. He escaped to France and joined with a group of royalists and disaffected parliamentarians. While abroad it is not certain what role, if any, he played in promoting the royalist cause, but the political tide was turning and he returned to England in late 1659. He was given a baronetcy in 1661 after the restoration of the monarchy. He married on 2 January 1666 his third wife, Anne Cotes (died 1688). A portrait of Long, \\"set about with diamonds,\\" now lost, was referred to in her will.  Family and death  He had six children from his first marriage, including Rebecca, who married Sir Philip Parker, 1st Baronet. Long died on 15 November 1672 at Whaddon, Wiltshire, where he was later buried. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son from his first marriage, Walter (1627‚Äì1710) who died without issue, and the title became extinct.

Life and work James was born in Cow Neck in North Hempstead on Long Island, to a Quaker family. He was the second of seven children and the first son born to Adam Mott (1762-1839) and his wife and distant cousin, Anne Mott (1768-1852). James later taught for two years at the Nine Partners Boarding School in Millbrook, New York where his father was the superintendent. James and Lucretia Mott At Nine Partners, he also met his future wife Lucretia Coffin, a student and later a teacher's aide. He married her on 10 April 1811 in Philadelphia. They had six children, five of whom lived to adulthood, four daughters and a son. James then began work as a partner in Lucretia's father's nail business in Philadelphia. In 1822, James became a textile merchant dealing in cotton. His Hicksite Quaker opposition to slavery, combined with increasing calls to end slavery by boycotting slave goods, influenced James to switch to dealing in wool, produced without the labor of slaves. Like his wife, James was an active abolitionist, dedicated his life to abolition and the free produce movement. In 1833, he attended the founding meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia, and signed the convention's declaration. Later, he helped found the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society with Lucretia. Mott's sister, Abigail Lydia Mott, and brother-in-law, Lindley Murray Moore were instrumental in founding the Rochester Anti-Slavery Society in 1838. In 1841, he published Three Months in Great Britain, an account of the journey he took with Lucretia to attend the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840. Though both he and his wife traveled as official delegates, the convention voted to exclude the female delegates from the United States. James Mott participated as an official delegate. James chaired the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, held in Seneca Falls, New York in 1848 on July 19 and 20 at which his wife was the main speaker. He and Lucretia signed the convention's Declaration of Sentiments. His brother, Richard Mott, was elected as an Opposition Party candidate to the Thirty-fourth and reelected as a Republican to the Thirty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1855 - March 3, 1859) In 1864, James helped start Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. He died of pneumonia in 1868 while visiting his daughter in Brooklyn, New York. Further reading * Hersh, Blanche Glassman.

The smokejumpers cared for these trees, but after their departure, both trees died. The Moon Tree Run (10k) was held annually to honor Roosa's achievement when the site was operating as a fire base. The Moon Tree Run has only recently begun to be held once again thanks to volunteer efforts. The mixed terrain race is similar to the original race course and there is also a 5k race offered.  Facilities and aircraft  Illinois Valley Airport covers an area of which contains one asphalt paved runway (18/36) measuring 4,807 x 75 ft (1,465 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2004, the airport had 6,000 aircraft operations, all of which were general aviation. The airport has a fixed-base operator, aircraft rentals and instruction, hangar rentals, and a restaurant (closed) and a small campground. All other services are four miles (6 km) north in Cave Junction. *Note: as of January 2008 the FBO and restaurant are closed.

His true name was Hoshino Shinnosuke (ÊòüÈáéÊÖé‰πãËºî). Hoshino Tenchi was one of the founders of the Bungakukai literary magazine, which was highly influential in the development of modern Japanese literature and Japanese poetry. Biography Hoshino was born in the Nihonbashi district of Edo to a family of sugar wholesale merchants. He was educated at the terakoya in Japanese calligraphy and the Chinese classics, but unusually for the time, also in the English language. He also attended a preparatory school for Ochanomizu University. However, even as a student he began to submit humorous stories to magazines, and eventually quit both school and the family business to obtain diplomas in jiujitsu and Japanese swordsmanship. In 1886, he entered the Agricultural Department of Tokyo Imperial University, where he majored in medicinal herbs. The following year, he was baptized into a Calvinist church, and became acquainted with Iwamoto Yoshiharu, an advocate of women's education and on graduation, accepted a post as an instructor of martial arts, psychology, western-style education, and kanji, at the Meiji Girls' School (ÊòéÊ≤ªÂ•≥Â≠¶Ê†°) in Tokyo. In 1890, he helped launch a women's magazine Joshigakusei (\\"Schoolgirl\\"), for which Christian schools in Japan cooperated by sending a cautionary tale and moral encouragement and poetry written by students, with contributions from known writers such as Kitamura Tokoku and Shimazaki Toson. In 1892, Hoshino helped launch the Bungakukai literary magazine, which he helped to edit over a ten-year period. Hoshino developed a literary circle with the various writers who lived near his home in Kamakura, where he resided from 1893. He is also known for his biographical works on the Kamakura period historical personages Mongaku, and Abutsu-ni. Hoshino married a fellow instructor at the Meiji Girls' School, Matsui Man, in 1895. A writer herself, she occasionally published stories disparaging her husband's obsession with the martial arts. In 1900, Hoshino also established an experimental farm in Chiba Prefecture. From 1904, Hoshino was vice principal of the newly established Kamakura Women's School. Around this time, he also became the 8th Grand Master of the Yagy≈´ Shingan ry≈´ school of martial arts. He established the Bugei-ka, a department for the transmission of classical martial arts at the Meiji Women's College, where he also taught the Yagy≈´ Shingan-ry≈´. After his house was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, he moved to Ashiya, Hy≈çgo, near Kobe, where he continued to teach Japanese calligraphy. He published his memoirs in 1938. In 1948, Hoshino was baptized as a Roman Catholic. He died of natural causes in 1950. References *Croissant, Doris.

Also called the Somogyi effect and posthypoglycemic hyperglycemia, it is a rebounding high blood sugar that is a response to low blood sugar.http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BarbaraDavis/Documents/book- understandingdiabetes/ud06.pdf, Understanding Diabetes a.k.a. The Pink Panther Book by H. Peter Chase, chapter 6 page 47. When managing the blood glucose level with insulin injections, this effect is counter-intuitive to people who experience high blood sugar in the morning as a result of an overabundance of insulin at night. This theoretical phenomenon was named after Michael Somogyi, a Hungarian-born professor of biochemistry at the Washington University and Jewish Hospital of St. Louis, who prepared the first insulin treatment given to a child with diabetes in the USA in October 1922.Michael Somogyi (www.whonamedit.com) Somogyi showed that excessive insulin makes diabetes unstable and first published his findings in 1938. (As of 2011-05-28, the electronic text is not open access). Compare with the dawn phenomenon, which is a morning rise in blood sugar in response to waning insulin and a growth hormone surge (that further antagonizes insulin). Background The rebounding blood sugar following undetected diabetic hypoglycemia can easily become chronic when the high morning blood sugar data is misjudged to be due to insufficient nighttime insulin delivery. A person with type 1 diabetes should balance insulin delivery to manage their blood glucose level. Occasionally, insufficient insulin can result in hyperglycemia. The appropriate response is to take a correction dose of insulin to reduce the blood sugar level and to consider adjusting the insulin regimen to deliver additional insulin in the future to prevent hyperglycemia. Conversely, excessive insulin delivery may result in hypoglycemia. The appropriate response is to treat the hypoglycemia and to consider adjusting the regimen to reduce insulin in the future. Somogyi and others have claimed that if prolonged hypoglycemia is untreated, then stress due to low blood sugar can result in a high blood glucose rebound. The physiological mechanisms driving the rebound are defensive. When the blood glucose level falls below normal, the body responds by releasing the endocrine hormone glucagon as well as the stress hormones epinephrine, cortisol and growth hormone. Glucagon facilitates release of glucose from the liver that raises the blood glucose immediately; the stress hormones cause insulin resistance for several hours, sustaining the elevated blood sugar. Detection The first line of defense in preventing chronic Somogyi rebound is additional blood glucose testing. Continuous glucose monitoring is the preferred method to detect and prevent the Somogyi rebound, but this technology is far from universally used. Alternatively, testing blood sugar more often, 8 to 10 times daily with a traditional blood glucose meter, facilitates detecting the low blood sugar level before such a rebound occurs. Testing occasionally during the middle of the night is also important, particularly when high waking blood sugars are found, to determine if more insulin is needed to prevent hyperglycemia or if less insulin is needed to prevent such a rebound. Sometimes a person with diabetes will experience the Somogyi rebound when awake and notice symptoms of the initial low blood sugar or symptoms of the rebound. Waking with a night sweat (perhaps combined with a rapid heart rate) is a symptom of the adrenaline and rebound. Unfortunately, the evidence shows that patients with type 1 diabetes do not normally wake during nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes. While reviewing log data of blood glucose after the fact, signs of Somogyi rebound should be suspected when blood glucose numbers seem higher after the insulin dosage has been raised, particularly in the morning. One simple way to determine if nocturnal hypoglycemia may be causing morning hyperglycemia is to have the patient have a high protein snack with a small amount of carbohydrates at bedtime. This will help keep the blood sugar up overnight and prevent the Somogyi effect. If the morning blood sugar decreases, this is indicative of the Somogyi effect and the daily insulin should be decreased. Avoidance In theory, avoidance is simply a matter of preventing hyperinsulinemia. In practice, the difficulty for a diabetic person to aggressively dose insulin to keep blood sugars levels close to normal ‚Äî while adjusting the insulin regimen to the demands of exercise, stress, and wellness ‚Äî can practically assure occasional hyperinsulinemia. The pharmacokinetic imperfections of all insulin replacement regimens is a severe limitation. Some practical behaviors which are useful in avoiding chronic Somogyi rebound are: *frequent blood glucose monitoring (8‚Äì10 times daily); *continuous blood glucose monitoring; *logging and review of blood glucose values, searching for patterns of low blood sugar values; *conservative increases in insulin delivery; *awareness to the signs of hypoglycemia; *awareness to hyperglycemia in response to increased delivery of insulin; *use of appropriate types of insulin (long-acting, short-acting, etc.) in appropriate amounts. Controversy Although this hypothesis is well known among clinicians and individuals with diabetes, there is little scientific evidence to support it. Clinical studies indicate that a high fasting glucose in the morning is more likely because the insulin given on the previous evening fails to last long enough. A study published in 2007 using continuous glucose monitoring showed that a low glucose during the night (nocturnal hypoglycemia) can be highly prevalent in type 1 diabetic treatments, but is associated rather with morning hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia. Furthermore, many individuals with hypoglycemic episodes during the night don't wake due to a failure of release of epinephrine during nocturnal hypoglycemia. Thus, Somogyi's hypothesis is not assured and may be refuted. See also *Idiopathic postprandial syndrome *Reactive hypoglycemia References Michael Cooperman, MD; Chief Editor: George T Griffing, MD.

Dangar Island is a suburb of Hornsby Shire and as at the 2016 census had a population of 303, which swells dramatically during holiday seasons. The island is serviced regularly by Brooklyn Ferry Service and departs from Brooklyn and takes about fifteen minutes. The Brooklyn ferry is itself adjacent to Hawkesbury River railway station. The ferry service is in operation 7 days a week.  History  Dangar Island has been known to the local Guringai Aborigines for thousands of years. The first European to visit the area was Governor Arthur Phillip, who explored the lower river by small boat in March 1788 within weeks of the First Fleet's arrival. He named it Mullet Island, for the abundance of fish in the local Hawksbury River. At first the local people were friendly towards him, but when he returned a year later, they would not come into contact. By 1790, over half the Guringai people had succumbed to the smallpox the British had brought with them.' History on the Hawkesbury River\\" The island was purchased in 1864 and renamed by Henry Cary Dangar, the son of Henry Dangar, a surveyor, pastoralist and parliamentarian. Dangar leased the island to the Union Bridge Company of Chicago for the construction of the original Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge between 1886-1889. About 300 workers and their families lived there and the island boasted a large social hall, school, library and its own newspaper. In the 1920s the island, which is barely a five-minute walk across, was divided into residential plots, though space was reserved on the beach, the flat and the top of the hill for recreational use. Dangar Island Post Office opened on 1 September 1951 and closed in 1986.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 303 people in Dangar Island. 61.2% of people were born in Australia and 85.4% of people spoke only English at home. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 49.2%.  About the island  The Brooklyn ferry wharf to Dangar Island In contrast to much of the surrounding area, which is designated national park, Dangar Island is relatively heavily inhabited. This was not always so. The island has several tarmacked roads which are closed off to all but the community fire truck, the council ute and vehicles with special permits. There are no private cars on the island. A wheelbarrow is a common method used to haul goods from the ferry. The island has one shop/caf√©, and a bowling club for members/visitors which has a bar. The island also has a community hall that supports several community groups, including a children's film workshop, and mains water. The island was connected to the water supply system by the then Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board in 1971. The island has since been connected to the Sydney sewerage system by Sydney Water, via a sub-marine pipeline to the mainland and a state-of-the-art treatment plant in Brooklyn. Septic tanks are being quickly phased out by most residents, providing a boost to the Hawkesbury waterways surrounding Dangar Island. Mail is delivered to the island daily by Australia's last Riverboat Postman. The island has a shop next to the ferry wharf that serves light snacks, coffee, breakfast and lunch. It also sells groceries and has a good supply of meat. On the weekend the Dangar Island Bowling Club, which is licensed, serves meals and you can play bowls.  Island access  Travelling by road from the south, from either Sydney or Hornsby, access is available by the M1 motorway. Drive across the Hawkesbury River Bridge at Kangaroo Point and follow the Brooklyn-Mooney Mooney turnoff just after you cross the river. Travelling by road from the north, from either Newcastle or Gosford, access is available via the M1 motorway. As you approach the Hawkesbury River you can exit the motorway via the Brooklyn-Mooney Mooney turnoff on your left hand side. Follow the signs to Brooklyn and drive through the village. At the end of the road you will find a public car park and the Dangar Island Ferry Wharf.UBD City Link 2006, street directory.

The recording project continues today, having followed Corporon to the University of North Texas. The project continues to this day under the label GIA. Corporon's recordings exist in the form of the Teaching Music Through Performance In Band Series, Windworks Series and Composer's Collections. Still more recordings have been released by The Keystone Winds, conducted by Jack Stamp. The Keystone Winds consists of faculty, alumni and students from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The Concordia University Chicago Wind Symphony, under Dr. Richard Fischer, has just released its twelfth recording of sacred wind music. Since the series began in 1991, the ensemble has made many premiere recordings of now widely known and played wind literature.

Formed for service during World War II, the regiment was raised in 1941, but was disbanded in late 1944 having never been deployed overseas. History The 2/10th Armoured Regiment was formed in Western AustraliaHopkins 1978, p. 55. in July 1941 as part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division.Hopkins 1978, p. 325.Handel 2003, p. 160. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel K.A Hall,Hopkins 1978, p. 318. the regiment conducted its initial training at Puckapunyal, Victoria, prior to being equipped with M3 Stuart and M3 Grant tanks. In mid-1942, the 2/10th Armoured was relocated to near Narrabri, New South Wales, where the division conducted large-scale exercises.Hopkins 1978, p. 100. In November 1942, following the reorganisation of the 1st Armoured Division, the regiment was transferred to the 1st Armoured Brigade to replace the 2/6th Armoured Regiment when that regiment deployed to New Guinea.Hopkins 1978, p. 326. By January 1943, manpower shortages in the Australian Army and the changing strategic situation facing the Allies in the Pacific meant that large armoured formations were no longer required. As a result, the decision was made to reduce the size of the 1st Armoured Division. At this time, as part of the 1st Armoured Brigade, the 2/10th Armoured Regiment was relocated to Western Australia to undertake garrison duties. When the 1st Armoured Division was disbanded in September 1943Hopkins 1978, p. 129. the regiment survived as part of the independent 1st Armoured Brigade Group.Hopkins 1978, p. 327. The 2/10th Armoured Regiment was disbanded in September 1944 along with the headquarters of the Brigade Group, and its personnel were reallocated to other units.Hopkins 1978, pp. 327‚Äì328. Commanding officers The following is a list of officers that commanded the 2/10th Armoured Regiment: * Lieutenant Colonel K.A Hall (July 1941 ‚Äì April 1942); * Lieutenant Colonel R.E Wade (April 1942 ‚Äì December 1943); * Lieutenant Colonel G.H Hardy (December 1943 ‚Äì February 1944); * Major H.S Foley (February ‚Äì April 1944); * Lieutenant Colonel J.F.P Burt (April 1944 ‚Äì September 1944).

First founded in 1897, the organisation is responsible for administering a sport with over 16,000 registered athletes, coaches and officials.\\\\- Athletics Australia - Annual Report 2006/07 History Athletics Australia (AA) was originally the Athletic Union of Australasia, an amateur group founded in 1897. In 1928, New Zealand broke away to form its own national body, leaving what was known as the Amateur Athletics Union of Australia (AAU). In 1932, an Australian Women's Amateur Athletics Union (AWAAU) was instituted and remained responsible for women's athletics until 1978. In that year, the separate national unions amalgamated into one governing body which, in 1989, was rebranded as Athletics Australia. Overview Athletics Australia conducts the Australian Athletics Tour and the Australian Athletics Championships, where athletes compete to gain selection for the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games and World Championships. The association also provides co-ordination, guidance, and support to member associations and affiliates, which govern athletics in their respective states, territories or jurisdictions (e.g. Paralympic athletics). A number of committees and commissions specialise in areas such as race walking, coaching and anti-doping.

He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs.Gerald L. Zahorchak, D. Ed. , Pennsylvania Department of Education, House Education Committee Hearing on Governor's Proposed Increase for Accountability Block Grants Testimony for Gerald L. Zahorchak, D. Ed. Secretary, May 30, 2007 Milton Area School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2003. The district has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, but realized no savings. Milton Area School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech and language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Coordinator. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over-identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth.

Real estate taxes For 2018-19 school year, the Milton Area School Board raised the local property tax to 67.86 mills for residents in Northumberland County. District residents in Union County were taxed at 16.40 mills.Milton Area School District administration, Notice Budget 2018-19, April 2018 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the Commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. The disparity of district resident's taxation on property taxes is compounded by the district crossing a county line. Property tax rates vary within the school district, depending on where the property is located. School districts located in more than one county are required to apportion the tax levy based on the market value in each county as determined by the State Tax Equalization Board pursuant to section 672.1 of the School Code. As a result, the tax rate increases are not the same for each county in a multi-county school district. *2017-18 - 67.7200 mills for residents in Northumberland County.

District residents' property taxes were to increase $400 in one year. After a contentious debate, the agency acknowledged the error and corrected the report. An audit of the agency, called for by local legislators, revealed that the STEB's documentation of municipalities showed 65 percent of the sample contained one or more deficiencies. The average yearly property tax paid by Northumberland County residents amounts to about 2.32% of their yearly income.

Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. =Act 1 Adjusted index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.

Teacher Evaluation process Historically by law, Pennsylvania's public school teachers are evaluated achieving one of two ratings, satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The evaluation provided no meaningful feedback in areas where an educator could improve. In June 2012, the Pennsylvania General Assembly established the new educator evaluation method, which was implemented in the 2013-14 school year. The new public school teacher evaluation includes multiple measures of student achievement, such as the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, the Pennsylvania Value Added Assessment System, graduation and promotion rates, as well as other elective data to be determined at the local level. The Milton Area School District volunteered to participate in a pilot project with the Pennsylvania Department of Education to develop statewide policy, tools and processes to evaluate teachers and principals in which student achievement is a significant factor affecting performance ratings. Secretary of Education Ron Tomalis announced that 104 K-12 entities, including nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units, signed-up to participate in the new teacher and principal evaluation pilot program. The initiative was funded by a Gates Momentum grant. During the 2011-12 school year, more than 120 school districts, charter schools, intermediate units, and career and technology centers participated in the second implementation phase of the new teacher evaluation tool. This included more than 650 supervisors and nearly 5,000 teachers in 366 school buildings participating in the pilot project. The final phase of the updated Pennsylvania public education professionals evaluation system was implemented during the 2012-13 school year, with 264 local education agencies, consisting of 1,387 school buildings, 1,892 principals/supervisors and more than 31,600 teachers included. In advocating for the new evaluation system, Secretary of Education Ronald Tomalis reported that research demonstrated that the performance of an educator has a direct impact on the future success of students.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Teacher Strategies to Improve Student Performance 2012 The new evaluation system will become effective for principals in the 2014-15 school year. In the United States of America, 22 other states use student achievement to evaluate educators.

It was released on June 19, 2007 through Ipecac Recordings, the record label owned by Tomahawk vocalist Mike Patton. Anonymous charted in Australia, Norway and the United States. Recorded after the departure of bass player Kevin Rutmanis, the songs on Anonymous are based on Native American compositions researched by guitarist Duane Denison. The album has received mildly positive reviews, being described as faithful to its source material. One single, \\"Sun Dance\\", was released to support the album.  Production  Anonymous was recorded after the departure of Tomahawk's bass player Kevin Rutmanis, leaving a lineup composed of Mike Patton, Duane Denison and John Stanier. Denison and Stanier recorded their musical parts for the album in Nashville, Tennessee, before sending them to Patton in San Francisco to add vocal parts and samples; the resulting album was a mix of live studio recordings and overdubbed sounds. Due to the absence of Rutmanis, both Denison and Patton recorded bass tracks for the album. Patton's former Mr. Bungle bandmate Trevor Dunn became the band's bass player in 2012. The songs on Anonymous are based on Native American compositions, which Denison had researched while touring Indian reservations with musician Hank Williams III. During that tour, Denison had been listening to Native American rock groups and was disappointed \\"at how normal they sounded\\", having expected to hear music that was \\"more aggressive, spookier and more kinetic\\" than the Southern rock and country rock he had heard. Denison found transcriptions of traditional music, and based his work for the album on these‚Äîthe title Anonymous is a reference to the uncredited composers of this source material. The original compositions were mostly written with one melody line‚Äîoften for a nose flute‚Äîwith a simple accompaniment such as hand clapping. As a result, Denison has said the group \\"took a lot of liberties, and filled in a lot of space\\", leaving much of the album newly composed around these simple frameworks. Denison has called Anonymous a \\"kind of a detour\\" from Tomahawk's usual sound, and described it as a concept album.  Release and reception  Anonymous was released on June 19, 2007, through Ipecac Recordings, the record label owned by Patton and Greg Werckman. The album's release was preceded by a digital single, \\"Sun Dance\\", on June 12. The B-side to the single was the non-album track \\"El Tecolote\\". Reviews for Anonymous have been mildly positive. Writing for AllMusic, Jason Lymangrover rated the album four stars out of five, calling it \\"undeniably a stunning musical exploration\\". Lymangrover compared the album to Frank Zappa's Apostrophe (') and Mr. Bungle's California, also noting similarities to Patton's other supergroup Fant√¥mas. Sputnik Music's Andrew H awarded the album a score of 4 out of 5, calling it \\"arguably the best Tomahawk [album] to date\\". The review praised Denison's work on retaining a faithful Native American tone on the compositions, while still allowing the album to sound familiar as a Tomahawk recording. Andrew Earles of The A.V. Club rated the album a \\"B\\", finding Patton's vocals uncharacteristically subtle. Earles felt that the album's best songs were \\"Cradle Song,\\" \\"Omaha Dance,\\" and \\"Antelope Ceremony\\", but felt negatively about \\"War Song\\" and \\"Red Fox\\". Pitchfork's Jason Crock gave the album a rating of 5.9 out of 10, calling it an \\"odd, headstrong little record\\". Crock felt that the group were respectfully faithful to the musical culture within which they were working, but described the resultant sound as resembling a film score more than a live band. Writing for PopMatters, Mike Schiller rated Anonymous 6 out of 10. Schiller felt that Patton's vocal work had an \\"air of non-commitment\\", but praised Denison's enthusiasm for the project, concluding that it might have worked better as an instrumental album. Schiller highlighted \\"Ghost Dance\\", \\"War Song\\" and \\"Long, Long Weary Day\\" as the best songs on the album. A review in CMJ New Music Monthly described Anonymous as \\"the real wampum\\", finding it to be a respectful tribute to Native American music.  Chart performance  Tomahawk playing in Boston in 2001 In the United States, Anonymous reached a peak position of 158 in the Billboard 200 albums chart, spending only one week in the chart. Among the other charts published by Billboard, Anonymous attained a peak of 12 on the Independent Albums chart and 2 on the Top Heatseekers countdown, spending two weeks in the former and three in the latter.

Description The shrub typically grows to a height of or is found sometimes as a tree up heights of around usually with a spreading habit. It has sericeous new shoots with pale yellow-brown hairs that age to have a silvery colour. The acutely angled branchlets are silvery-sericeous. The silvery-green to grey-green phyllodes usually have an obliquely narrowly elliptic shape that is more or less straight but often shallowly recurved at the apice. The phyllodes are around in length and have a width of and have a knob shaped mucro. The rudimentary inflorescences occur in pairs in the racemes and have a axes length of . The golden flower spikes are in length with hairy petals. The seed pods that form later are openly and strongly curved or tightly and irregularly coiled or twisted with twisted dehisced valves. The glabrous pods have a width of and are thinly coriaceous to crustaceous. The glossy brown to black coloured seeds within the pods have an oblong shape and are in length with a bright yellow aril. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Bruce Maslin and L.A.J.Thomson in 1992 in the work Re-appraisal of the taxonomy of Acacia holosericea, including the description of a new species, A. colei, and the reinstatement of A. neurocarpa published in the journal Australian Systematic Botany. It was reclassified as Racosperma colei by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then returned to genus Acacia in 2006. The species is commonly confused with Acacia holosericea which it closely resembles. There are two varieties: * Acacia colei Maslin & L. A. J. Thomson var. colei, known as Cole's wattle. * Acacia colei var. ileocarpa M. W. McDonald & Maslin, known as curly-podded Cole‚Äôs wattle. Distribution The plant is found throughout northern Australia between latitudes of 16¬∞S and 22¬∞S from the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia in the west extending east through the Tanami Desert and Great Sandy Deserts in the Northern Territory and into the Simpson Desert and Gulf Country of western Queensland. It is well adapted to an arid environment and is found in a variety of habitat including stony hills and ridges, sandplains, floodplains and along drainage lines growing in stony, sandy, clay-loam soils.

Description The tree can grow to a height of , but more often it grows as a large shrub.Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants (ASGAP) It has glabrous, flexuose, flattened and narrowly winged branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than trues leaves. The evergreen phyllodes have a narrowly elliptic shape and are in length and wide. They have seven to nine prominent main nerves. The inflorescences occur in groups of four to eight and are found in the axils. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of about and can contain 35 to 45 golden coloured flowers. The thinly coriaceous-crustaceous seed pods that form after flowering have a linear shape and are rounded over the seeds. The wrinkled and glabrous pods are up to in length and wide. The dark brown seeds within have a subglobular shape and are in length. It is not listed as being a threatened species. It is commonly used in environmental management. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1842 as a part of William Jackson Hooker's work Notes on Mimoseae, with a synopsis of species as published in the London Journal of Botany. It was reclassified as Racosperma complanatum in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word complano meaning flattened'i in reference to the shape of the stems. The only listed variety is Acacia complanata var. fasciculata'. Distribution The shrub is widely distributed throughout south-eastern Queensland from around Jericho in the west to around Bundaberg in the west and is also found as far south west as the Dumaresq River in New South Wales and down the north coast to around Coffs Harbour, New South Wales where it situated on low ridges growing in gravelly, sandy to loamy soils often over sandstone usually as a part of heathland or dry sclerophyll forest communities.

After being captured by the Gauda king during the reign of his father, he was able to re-establish the rule of the Varman's. He made political alliances with Harshavardhana of Thaneswar, against the alliance of the Gauda and East Malwa. He was visited by Xuanzang and Li Yi-piao, the envoy of the Tang dynasty who have left accounts of the king and the kingdom. Bhaskaravarman came to power after his brother Supratisthitavarman had died. He was the first Kamarupa king to claim descent from the mythical Narakasura, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta.\\"The mythical ancestors of (the Varman) line of rulers were Naraka, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta.\\" After his death Salasthambha, who established the Mlechchha dynasty, acquired power in Kamarupa Kingdom. He issued the Dubi and Nidhanpur copper plate grants, re-issued after his ancestor Bhutivarman, and a clay seal found in Nalanda. Background After Susthitavarman was defeated by Mahasenagupta, his son Supratisthitavarman came to power, who built Kamarupa's elephant army but died prematurely without an heir. Thus, the younger son, Bhaskaravarman, came to power in Kamarupa. Even after he succeeded to the throne , Bhaskaravarman was known as kumara (prince), probably because he was a bachelor throughout his life. Rivals Mahasenagupta, in alliance with Shashanka, had defeated on Susthitavarman and took control over north and central Bengal. After the death of Mahasenagupta Shashanka became the ruler of this portion. On ascending the throne Bhaskaravarman found two strong rival powers growing in northern India, viz. one in central and northern Bengal under Shashanka and the other in mid-India under Prabhakaravardhana, the father of Harshavardhana. When Shashanka murdered Rajyavardhana who had succeeded Prabhakaravardhana as the king at Thaneswar, Bhaskaravarman sent an envoy, Hangsavega, to form an alliance. This incident by both Bana and Xuanzang. Alliance with Harsha The Harsha Charita of Bana gives a detailed account of Hangsavega's meeting with Harsha. Plying him with gifts and praise, the diplomat was able to effect an offensive and defensive alliance between the two kings. The Nidhanpur copper-plate grant was issued from Bhaskaravarman's victorious camp at Karnasuvarna, the erstwhile capital of Shashanka.  Alliance with Chinese  After 648 CE, the Chinese invaded India to avenge the insult done to Chinese representatives at the court of Harshavardhana by the minister who usurped the throne of Harshavardhana after his death. The minister was defeated and captured. In the conflict, Bhaskaravarman aided the Chinese with supplies of cattle, horse and accoutrement. Xuanzang's account The Chinese traveller, Xuanzang, visited Bhaskaravarman in his court on his invitation, noting the King patronised Buddhism though a non-Buddhist. According to the text of the Si-yu-ki, the circumference of the capital of Kamarupa was thirty li and the king who was Bhaskaravarman, a Brahman by caste. Xuanzang translated into sanskrit the Taoist text, Daodejing at the request of Bhaskar Varman Kamarupa of Bhaskaravarman Xuanzang, in his travelogue, noted that he crossed a great river Karatoya before entering the Kamarupa. The eastern boundary was a line of hills close to the Chinese frontier. He also said Kamarupa was nearly 1700 miles in circumference. The climate was genial. He mentioned that the people were are short height and of yellow complexion and Bhaskar Varman was Hindu and not Buddhist. The people were honest. Their speech differed a little from that of mid-India. They were of violent disposition but were persevering students. They worshipped the Devas and did not believe in Buddhism. The Deva- temples were some hundreds in number and the various systems had some myriads of professed adherents. The few Buddhists in the country performed their acts of devotion in secret. The pilgrim ascertained from the people that to the east of the country was a series of hills which reached as far as the confines of China. The inhabitants of these hills were akin to the \\"Man of the Lao\\". In the south-east of the country elephants were plentiful. =Description= Xuanzang notes that Kamarupa was low and moist, and that the crops were regular. Cocoa-nuts and jackfruits grew abundantly and were appreciated by the people. The description provided is around the present-day Guwahati. According to the account given in the Si-yu-ki, the circumference of Kamarupa was about . As Edward Albert Gait has pointed out, this circumference must have included the whole of the Assam valley, Surma valley, parts of North Bengal, and parts of Mymensingh. =Religion= Bhaskaravarman was a worshiper of Shiva, though he had great reverence for learned Buddhist priests and professors of his time, and was distinctly inclined towards Buddhism. The general populace worshiped the Devas worshiped in many temples, and adherents of Buddhism practised devotion secretly. =Culture= According to Xuanzang, the people of Kamarupa were honest, albeit with a violent disposition, but were persevering students. The people were are short in height and of yellow complexion. Their speech differed from that of mid-India. The Nidhanpur grant issued from Karnasuvarna, contained local literary forms and offices not found in subsequent Kamarupa inscriptions =Art and industry= The gifts from Bhaskaravarman to Harshavardhana contained mostly products of the land‚Äîroyal umbrella of exquisite workmanship studded with valuable gems, puthis written on Sachi-bark, dyed cane-mats, Agar-essence, musk in silk-bags, liquid molasses in earthen-pots, utensils, paintings, a pair of Brahmini ducks in a cage made of cane and overlaid with gold, and a considerable quantity of silk- fabrics indicating industry was rudimentary. Nidhanpur inscription Nidhanpur inscription of Bhaskaravarman Bhaskaravarman praises himself in his Nidhanpur copper-plate inscription, saying that \\"he has revealed the light of the Arya religion by dispelling the accumulated darkness of Kali age, by making a judicious application of his revenues; who has equalled the prowess of the whole ring of his feudatories by the strength of his own arm, who has derived many a way of enjoyment for his hereditary subjects whose loyal devotion to him was augmented by his steadiness, modesty and affability, who is adorned with a wonderful ornament of splendid fame made of the flowery words of praise variously composed by hundreds of kings vanquished by him in battle; whose virtuous activities, like those of Sivi, were applied in making gifts for the benefit of others; whose powers, as of a second preceptor of the Gods (Brihaspati), was recognised by others on account of his skill in devising and applying the means of politics that appear in suitable moments; whose own conduct was adorned by learning, valour, patience, prowess and good actions\\". Nalanda seal The Nalanda seal of Bhaskaravarman dated 643 Bhaskaravarman's close connection with Harsha and Xuanzang led to his association with the famous Buddhist university of Magadha, for his seal has been discovered at the site of Nalanda in the company of two fragmentary seals of Harsha. The seals were found by Dr. Spooner during the excavation of the ruins of Nalanda in the year 1917‚Äì18. The text of the seal is as follows: K.N. Dikshit, in his \\"Epigraphical notes of the Nalanda finds\\", thinks that the seal probably accompanied Bhaskaravarman's letter to Silabhadra inviting Xuanzang. As however it was found in the company of the two Harsha seals the probability is that both Harsha and Bhaskaravarman, on their march from Rajmahal to Kanauj, visited Nalanda together with the Chinese pilgrim and, to commemorate their visit, left their respective seals at the university. Death It is not known how or when Bhaskaravarman died, but it is estimated that his reigned ended about 650. Legacy Kumar Bhaskar Varma Sanskrit and Ancient Studies University of Nalbari, Assam has been named after him.

Ultimate credit for Interlingua must go to the American heiress Alice Vanderbilt Morris (1874‚Äì1950), who became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s. In 1924, Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis.Falk, Julia S. \\"Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, Language and Communication, 15(3): pp. 241-259. Pergamon, 1995. Investigations of the auxiliary language problem were in progress at the International Research Council, the American Council on Education, the American Council of Learned Societies, the British, French, Italian, and American Associations for the advancement of science, and other groups of specialists. Morris created IALA as a continuation of this work.Bray, Mary Connell [1951] (1971), \\"Foreword\\", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language, Second Edition, New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. . OCLC 162319. Retrieved on 2007-03-05. She developed the research program of IALA in consultation with Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.  International Auxiliary Language Association  The IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, Sapir's cross-linguistic semantic studies of totality (1930) and grading phenomena (1944). Morris herself edited Sapir and Morris Swadesh's 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson's 1937 study of indication. Although the Morrises and their family provided most of IALA's funding, it also received support from such prestigious groups as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. In its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics; and comparing extant IALs, including Esperanto, Esperanto II, Ido, Latino sine flexione, Novial, and Interlingue. In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities. It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, debating features and goals of their representative languages. With a \\"concession rule\\" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive. At the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in Geneva in 1931, IALA began to break new ground. Its conference was attended by recognized linguists, 27 of whom signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in Rome in 1933. Also in 1933, Professor Herbert N. Shenton of Syracuse University organized an intensive study of the problems encountered with interlanguages when used in international conferences. Later that same year, Dr. Edward L. Thorndike published a paper about the relative learning speeds of \\"natural\\" and \\"modular\\" constructed languages. Both Shenton and Thorndike were major influences on IALA's work from then on. In 1937, the first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee. Development of a new language Originally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \\"Profunde recerca duce a un lingua\\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006. To that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., Novial and Occidental) or systematic (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Dr. Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many - or even a majority - of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best. At the outbreak of World War II, IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where E. Clark Stillman established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Dr. Alexander Gode, developed a prototyping technique - an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of control languages. In 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. In 1945, IALA published a General Report - largely Morris's work - which presented three models for IALA's language: * Model P was a naturalistic model that made no attempt to regularize the prototyped vocabulary. * Model E was lightly schematicized along the lines of Occidental. * Model K was moderately schematicized along the lines of Ido (i.e., somewhat less schematicized than Esperanto). From 1946 to 1948, the renowned French linguist Andr√© Martinet was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. An initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of 1945. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, \\"Le natura, si - un schema, no\\", Historia de interlingua, 2001, revised 2006. =The four models= Four models were canvassed: Model P and K, plus two new models similar to Model E of 1945. { border=0 - valign=top  Model P  highly naturalistic  Jo habe nascite, o dea cum le oculos azure, de parentes barbare, inter le bone et virtuose Cimmerios - valign=top  Model M  moderately naturalistic Io have nascit, o dea con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuos Cimmerios - valign=top  Model C  slightly schematic Yo ha nascet, o deessa con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimerios - valign=top  Model K  moderately schematic Yo naskeba, o dea kon le okuli azure, de parenti barbare, inter le bone e virtuose Kimerii - valign=top  colspan=3  (modern Interlingua) Io ha nascite, o dea con le oculos azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimmerios - valign=top  colspan=3  (English) 'I was born, O goddess with the blue eyes, of barbarian relations, among the good and virtuous Cimmerians' } Model P was unchanged from 1945; Model M was relatively modern in comparison to more classical P. Model K was slightly modified in the direction of Ido. The vote total ended up as follows: P 26.6%, M 37.5%, C 20%, and K 15%. The results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected - K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C. Finalization When Martinet took up a position at Columbia University in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development. His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary. The vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized Interlingua Grammar and the 27,000-word Interlingua-English Dictionary (IED). In 1954, IALA published an introductory manual entitled Interlingua a Prime Vista (\\"Interlingua at First Sight\\"). Success, decline, and resurgence An early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter Spectroscopia Molecular, published from 1952 to 1980.Breinstrup, Thomas, \\"Un revolution in le mundo scientific\\" (A revolution in the scientific world). Accessed January 16, 2007. In 1954 Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress, in Washington DC, for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. Science Service, the publisher of Science Newsletter at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the powerful International Organization for Standardization, which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries. The IALA closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.Esterhill, Frank, Interlingua Institute: A History. New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.

Access January 16, 2007. was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua precis for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977. The Interlingua Institute was adrift for a while after the deaths of Blair in 1967 and Gode in 1970. According to Esterhill, however, publishing slowed only briefly in the late 1960s and revived soon afterward, at about the time of the 1971 second edition of the IED. Flourishing interest in Europe may have counterbalanced the struggles taking place in America. Interlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably Occidental and Ido. The former Occidentalist Ric Berger founded The Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) in 1955,Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.

Frequent European coverage has continued to date, joined by media attention in South America in the early 1990s.Interlingua in le pressa. Accessed January 17, 2007. Beginning in the 1980s UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in Sweden and Italy, and in the 1990s, Brazil and Switzerland.Bibliographia de Interlingua.

It grows to a height of 2‚Äì15 m (7‚Äì50 ft) and it flowers from July to September. Cultivated throughout Australia and in many other countries, Acacia decurrens has naturalised in most Australian states and in Africa, the Americas, Europe, New Zealand and the Pacific, the Indian Ocean area, and Japan.  Description  Acacia decurrens is a fast-growing tree, reaching anywhere from 2 to 15 m (7‚Äì50 ft) high. The bark is brown to dark grey colour and smooth to deeply fissured longitudinally with conspicuous intermodal flange marks. The branchlets have longitudinal ridges running along them that are unique to the species. Young foliage tips are yellow. . Alternately arranged leaves with dark green on both side. Stipules are either small or none. Base of petiole swollen to form the pulvinus. Leaf blade is bipinnate. Rachis is 20‚Äì120 mm long, angular and hairless. 15‚Äì45 pairs of widely spaced small leaflets (pinnules) are connected each other and 5‚Äì15 mm long by 0.4‚Äì1 mm wide, straight, parallel sided, pointed tip, tapering base, shiny and hairless or rarely sparsely hairy leaves. The small yellow or golden-yellow flowers are very cottony in appearance and are densely attached to the stems in each head with 5‚Äì7 mm long and 60‚Äì110 mm long axillary raceme or terminal panicle. They are bisexual and fragrant. The flowers have five petals and sepals and numerous conspicuous stamens. Ovary is superior and has only one carpel with numerous ovules. Flowering is followed by the seed pods, which are ripe over November to January. Dark brown or reddish brown to black colour of the seed are located inside of parallel sided, flattish, smooth pod. They are 20‚Äì105 mm long by 4‚Äì8.5 mm wide with edges. Seed opens by two valves. Pods are initially hairy but they become hairless when they grow. Taxonomy German botanist Johann Christoph Wendland first described this species as Mimosa decurrens in 1798, before his countryman Carl Ludwig Willdenow redescribed it in the genus Acacia in 1919. In his description, Willdenow did not cite Wendland but instead a 1796 description by James Donn. However, as Donn's description was a nomen nudum, the proper citation is Acacia decurrens Willd. with neither older work cited. George Bentham classified A. decurrens in the series Botrycephalae in his 1864 Flora Australiensis. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma decurrens in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name is treated as a synonym of its original name. Common names include coast green wattle, black wattle, early black wattle, Sydney green wattle, queen wattle, and in the local Dharawal language, Boo'kerrikin. Maiden noted that was called Wat-tah by the indigenous people of Cumberland (Parramatta) and Camden districts. Sydney wattle was a name coined by von Mueller and early settlers around Penrith called it green wattle. Feathery wattle was another early name. It is also known as early green wattle in the Sydney basin, as it flowers in winter‚Äîearlier than similar species such as Parramatta wattle (Acacia parramattensis), blueskin (A. irrorata) and late black wattle (A. mearnsii). It has attracted the vernacular name \\"green cancer\\" in South Africa, where it has become weedy. Other names include acacia bark, wattle bark, tan wattle, golden teak, and Brazilian teak. Along with other bipinnate wattles, it is classified in the section Botrycephalae within the subgenus Phyllodineae in the genus Acacia. An analysis of genomic and chloroplast DNA along with morphological characters found that the section is polyphyletic, though the close relationships of A. decurrens and many other species were unable to be resolved.  Distribution and habitat  Acacia decurrens Distribution (Australia) Acacia decurrens is native to Tablelands of New South Wales and Victoria. Temperate coastal to cool inland but not dry or hot areas of inland NSW. High rainfall areas with per year, otherwise tolerant of a wide range of conditions. In woodlands and dry sclerophyll forests in New South Wales, it grows with such trees such as grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) and narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra). In areas where it has become naturalised, Acacia decurrens is generally found on roadsides, along creeklines and in waste areas. It also grows in disturbed sites nearby bushlands and open woodlands. It was extensively planted in New South Wales, and it is difficult to tell whether it is native or naturalised in areas near its native range. The species became naturalised in other states including Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. It grows on shale and sandstone soils with medium nutrients and good drainage. Despite its invasive nature, it has not been declared a noxious weed by any state or Australian government body. Ecology The dark brown or black seed is main source of reproduction. They can be spread by ants or birds, and form a seedbank in the soil. Seedlings generally grow rapidly after bushfire, and the species can colonise disturbed areas. Trees can live for 15‚Äì50 years. Sulphur-crested cockatoos eat the unripe seed. The foliage serves as food for the caterpillars of the double-spotted line blue (Nacaduba biocellata), moonlight jewel (Hypochrysops delicia), imperial hairstreak (Jalmenus evagoras), ictinus blue (Jalmenus ictinus), amethyst hairstreak (Jalmenus icilius) and silky hairstreak (Pseudalmenus chlorinda). The wood serves as food for larvae of the jewel beetle species Agrilus australasiae, Cisseis cupripennis and C. scabrosula.  Uses  Uses for it include chemical products, environmental management, and wood. The flowers are edible and are used in fritters. An edible gum oozing from the tree's trunk can be used as a lesser-quality substitute for gum arabic, for example in the production of fruit jelly. The bark contains about 37‚Äì40% tannin. The flowers are used to produce yellow dye, and the seed pods are used to produce green dye.Plants for a Future Database An organic chemical compound called kaempferol gives the flowers of Acacia decurrens their color. It has been grown for firewood, or as a fast-growing windbreak or shelter tree. Acacia decurrens (Wendl. f.) Willd. ‚Äì green wattle seeds  Cultivation  Acacia decurrens adapts easily to cultivation and grows very quickly. It can be used as a shelter or specimen tree in large gardens and parks. The tree can look imposing when in flower. Cultivation of A. decurrens can be started by soaking the seeds in warm water and sowing them outdoors. The seeds keep their ability to germinate for many years. Internet Archive Select Extra- tropical Plants Readily Eligible for Industrial Culture Or Naturalization By Ferdinand von Mueller Fieldwork conducted in the Southern Highlands found that the presence of bipinnate wattles (either as understory or tree) was related to reduced numbers of noisy miners, an aggressive species of bird that drives off small birds from gardens and bushland, and hence recommended the use of these plants in establishing green corridors and revegetation projects.

It gets its common and scientific name for its sickle-shaped leaves. Hardy and adaptable to cultivation, it is used in regeneration of bushland. Taxonomy German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow was the first to officially describe the sickle wattle in 1806, although his countryman Johann Christoph Wendland had given it the name Mimosa obliqua in 1798, this was deemed an illegitimate name. The species name is derived from the Latin word falx \\"sickle\\". Some common names for it are burra, sally, sickle-shaped acacia and silver-leaved wattle. Description leaves and developing buds Found as a shrub or small tree from high, Acacia falcata has grey or black bark. Like most wattles it has phyllodes rather than leaves. These are a pale green or grey-green and sickle-shaped, measuring in length, by wide with a prominent mid vein. The small round flowers are cream or pale- yellow and appear in early winter from April to August. These are followed by thin seed pods which are long and wide. The pods mature from September to December. Distribution and habitat The range is from Queensland south through eastern New South Wales to Bermagui on the south coast. It grows predominantly on shale soils in open forest, and is associated with such trees as Eucalyptus paniculata, E. longifolia and E. tereticornis. Naturalised, it has been recorded in Java in Indonesia, and in North Island in New Zealand. Ecology Plants live for five to twenty years in the wild, and are killed by bushfire. The seed is released in December, and dispersed by wind. It is stored in the soil, although it is unclear how related germination is to bushfire. Seed can germinate in disturbed areas. Acacia falcata is the host plant for the Imperial Hairstreak (Jalmenus evagoras). One field study recovered 98 species of bug (hemiptera) from A. falcata across its range. Cultivation and uses Acacia falcata is adaptable to a wide range of soils in cultivation, and its attractive foliage is a horticultural feature. It is propagated by seed which must be pretreated with boiling water before it is able to germinate. It is easy to grow given a good sunlit position and good drainage, and is used in revegetation. Australian indigenous people use the bark to make a liniment for treating ailments of the skin. A. falcata is excellent for stabilizing barren sand. The bark is important in the tanning industry.

It is characterized by loss of motion and sensation in arms and hands. It usually results from trauma which causes damage to the neck, leading to major injury to the central corticospinal tract of the spinal cord. The syndrome is more common in people over the age of 50 because osteoarthritis in the neck region causes weakening of the vertebrae. CCS most frequently occurs among older persons with cervical spondylosis, however, it also may occur in younger individuals. CCS is the most common incomplete spinal cord injury syndrome. It accounts for approximately 9% of traumatic SCIs. After an incomplete injury, the brain still has the capacity to send and receive some signals below the site of injury. Sending and receiving of signals to and from parts of the body is reduced, not entirely blocked. CCS gives a greater motor loss in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs, with variable sensory loss. It was first described by Schneider in 1954. It is generally associated with favorable prognosis for some degree of neurological and functional recovery. However, factors such as age, preexisting conditions, and extent of injury will affect the recovery process. Presentation CCS is characterized by disproportionately greater motor impairment in upper compared to lower extremities, and variable degree of sensory loss below the level of injury in combination with bladder dysfunction and urinary retention. This syndrome differs from that of a complete lesion, which is characterized by total loss of all sensation and movement below the level of the injury. Causes In older patients, CCS most often occurs after acute hyperextension injury in an individual with long-standing cervical spondylosis. A slow, chronic cause in this age group is when the cord gets caught and squeezed between a posterior intervertebral disc herniation against the anterior cord and/or with posterior pressure on the cord from hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum (Lhermitte's sign may be the experience that causes the patient to seek medical diagnosis). However, CCS is not exclusive to older patients as younger individuals can also sustain an injury leading to CCS. Typically, younger patients are more likely to get CCS as a result of a high-force trauma or a bony instability in the cervical spine. Historically, spinal cord damage was believed to originate from concussion or contusion of the cord with stasis of axoplasmic flow, causing edematous injury rather than destructive hematomyelia. More recently, autopsy studies have demonstrated that CCS may be caused by bleeding into the central part of the cord, portending less favorable prognosis. Studies also have shown from postmortem evaluation that CCS probably is associated with selective axonal disruption in the lateral columns at the level of the injury to the spinal cord with relative preservation of the grey matter. Management=Nonsurgical= In many cases, individuals with CCS can experience a reduction in their neurological symptoms with conservative management. The first steps of these intervention strategies include admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) after initial injury. After entering the ICU, early immobilization of the cervical spine with a neck collar would be placed on the patient to limit the potential of further injury. Cervical spine restriction is maintained for approximately six weeks until the individual experiences a reduction in pain and neurological symptoms. Inpatient rehabilitation is initiated in the hospital setting, followed by outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy to assist with recovery. An individual with a spinal cord injury may have many goals for outpatient occupational and physiotherapy. Their level of independence, self-care, and mobility are dependent on their degree of neurological impairment. Rehabilitation organization and outcomes are also based on these impairments. The physiatrist, along with the rehabilitation team, work with the patient to develop specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-centered goals. With respect to physical therapy interventions, it has been determined that repetitive task-specific sensory input can improve motor output in patients with central cord syndrome. These activities enable the spinal cord to incorporate both supraspinal and afferent sensory information to help recover motor output. This occurrence is known as \\"activity dependent plasticity\\". Activity dependent plasticity is stimulated through such activities as: locomotor training, muscle strengthening, voluntary cycling, and functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling =Surgical= Surgical intervention is usually given to those individuals who have increased instability of their cervical spine, which cannot be resolved by conservative management alone. Further indications for surgery include a neurological decline in spinal cord function in stable patients as well as those who require cervical spinal decompression.

It grows to its greatest size when rainfall of 800-900mm is received but can grow and even thrive in very dry conditions such as the Karoo region of western South Africa. The requirement here is for deep soils that allow its roots to spread. Everywhere in its range, however, the tree is easily recognised by its distinctive long white paired thorns and coffee coloured bark, both of which are very attractive. In the tropics it shows little variation but at the southern end of its range it becomes more variable in appearance. Adaptations Vachellia karroo has a life span of 30‚Äì40 years and is an adaptable pioneer, able to establishing itself without shade, shelter or protection from grass fires. Once over a year old, seedlings can resprout after fire. Several fungi are associated with this tree and the crown of mature trees may be parasitized by various mistletoes, leading to the tree's decline. This tree has a long taproot which enables it to use water and nutrients from deep underground, this and its ability to fix nitrogen, lead to grasses and other plants thriving in its shade. The tree has been noted to occur in the Torre del Mar area, near Malaga, Spain. Here it grows freely as a large shrub on waste ground. It has been used as hedging to keep out goats from vegetable plots. Flowers during July.  Uses  leftthumb Winter habit of tree V. karroo is used for chemical products, forage, domestic uses, environmental management, fibre, food, drink, and wood. The tough wood is white to slightly yellowish in colour, rarely producing dark brown heartwood. It is widely cultivated in Asia, Australia, the Mediterranean region, India and the Indian Ocean area. The large thorns mean that the tree must be approached, and the branches handled, carefully. =Food= As is common in acacias, edible gum seeps from cracks in the tree's bark, and is an important part of the bushbaby's winter diet. The gum can be used to manufacture candy (see Gum arabic) and used to have economic importance as \\"Cape Gum\\". In dry areas, the tree's presence is a sign of water, both above and underground. = Forage and fodder = The tree is especially useful as forage and fodder for domestic and wild animals. Apparently, there is no risk of poisoning from it. Goats seem to like V. karroo better than cattle.World AgroForestry Centre The small pom-pom shaped yellow flowers are attractive in mid-summer. The flowers make it a very good source of forage for honey bees; honey from it has a pleasant taste. =Wood and bark= V. karroo is an excellent source of firewood and charcoal. The wood is also used for fencing posts for cattle byres or kraals. The heartwood has a density of about 800 kg/m¬≥. A tough rope can be made from the inside bark of the tree. =Traditional medicine= The gum, bark and leaves have been used as a soothing agent and astringent for colds, conjunctivitis and hemorrhage in other region South Africa. However thorns were even used by early naturalists to pin the insects they collected! It is very widespread throughout southern Africa and there are different forms in some places, which can be confusing. Vachellia karroo may be found from the Western Cape through to Zambia and Angola. In tropical Africa it is replaced by Vachellia seyal. The name acacia is derived from Greek \\"akis\\" a point or barb. Karroo is one of the old spellings of karoo which cannot be corrected because of the laws governing botanical nomenclature (giving of names).Joffe, Pitta: Indigenous Plants of South Africa, 2007, Briza Publications, p87  Bans  Notifiable in NSW, Australia.

It was formerly included in the genus Acacia. Description Senegalia laeta is a perennial shrub or small tree growing to a height of 4‚Äì10 m with a greyish-green bark looking blackish from a distance, with a pink slash. The leaves are twice-pinnate, i.e. the pinnate leaves are further divided pinnately, the leaflets are 1‚Äì4 cm long, with 2-5 pairs of pinnae and 2-5 pairs of leaflets per pinna; leaflets are oblong and asymmetrical, measuring 6-1.2 x 0.3-0.5 cm, greyish green and almost hairless. These leaves distinguish Senegalia laeta from the related sympatric species such as Senegalia dudgeoni, Senegalia senegal, Senegalia gourmaensis and Senegalia mellifera by its leaves. The thorns are paired and consist of recurved axillary prickles, with an occasional a third prickle recurved forward, if the third thorn is absent it is normally replaced with a leaf. The flowers are creamy white and very fragrant, with three flowers set on a stalk with multiple stalks growing on a spike. The pale brown leathery pods are pointed, whereas those of Seneglia senegal are not and this character is an easy feature to distinguish these Senegalia laeta from that species.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Lebas F., 2018. Black-hooked acacia (Senegalia laeta). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/348 Last updated on February 12, 2018, 11:44 Distribution Senegalia laeta is native to Africa, including the Sahara as far south as Tanzania, the Middle East, and Western Asia.  Uses  Parts of the tree are used for dyestuff. The tree is used for fodder; the foliage and seed pods make good forage for livestock and the tree stands up well to this use. It produces an edible gum which is used to make gum arabic but is not as good quality as the gum Arabic extracted from Senegalia senegal. It is harvested at the end of the rainy season when the gum is exuded from the bark and branches and collected by scraping, the bark is sometimes cut to increase production. Other uses to which Senegalia laeta is put are as fuel-wood and charcoal, browse for domestic animals, dead fencing for bomas, poles, fence- posts. The bark from the trunk is used for making ropes and repairing calabashes, and in medicine it is considered to have analgesic properties. It is also used to soften hides before tanning. It is drought tolerant and has been successfully planted in reafforestation programmes. Taxonomy Formerly included in the genus Acacia it has now been reassigned with many African species of acacia to the genus Senegalia. The specific name laeta is the feminine of laetus and means \\"joyful, cheerful, happy\\" in Latin.

Swire describes a sturdy figure in \\"a dark red ... Biography He was born in Orosh, Mirdita, the only son of Kapidan Marka Gjoni (1861‚Äì1925). His father was the leader or Kapidan of Mirdita who rebelled against the Albanian government if favour of an independent Mirdita. In 1921 in an alliance with Esadists, Marka Gjoni founded the Republic of Mirdita in northern Albania and served as its president during its short existence. His republic did not receive recognition by its alleged citizens nor from other countries. Marka Gjoni's rebellion was extinguished by the Albanian government later that year. Marka Gjoni fled to Yugoslavia, but later returned to Albania and remained active in the political life of the highlands.At Giuseppe Valentini, Vepra (publicistik√´, studime dhe tekste) (Plejad: Tirana, 2005) 742. Gjon married Mrika Pervizi (1883-1969) in 1904, the niece of the Bajraktar of Kurbin, Gjok Pjeter Pervizi. They had ten children. =Succession as clan leader, 1925= After the death of his father, Kapidan Marka Gjoni in 1925, Kapidan Gjon inherited the responsibility handed down to him as leader of Mirdita. mirdita.net He was often called upon to intervene in feuds raging within other Mirdita tribes and to preside over the arguments with fairness and clarity, but most of all to pass on judgments following the guidelines of the Kanun. Although young, at the age of 37 he was already distinguished as a leader of the mission. He was responsible for reconciling 620 blood feuds between 1926-1928, leading Mirdita to become one of the more peaceful regions of the North. Because of his leadership skills in mediating reconciliation, he became widely known and many activists and foreign leaders requested to meet him. In 1930 Kapidan Gjon went to Rome where he was received with high honours by the Italian Government and the Pope. In a conversation with Zog, the then president of Albania, Kapidan Gjon presented his economic views on the poor state of Mirdita, getting a promise that the region would be exempt from any state tax. When Ahmet Zogu was proclaimed king in 1928, all the northern chiefs of the mountains, among them Kapidan Gjon, met with the him, while Gjon was the first chief offered a meeting with the King. In 1944, Kapidan Gjon, along with his sons, Mark, Ndue and Lesh, organized an anti-communist resistance. Thus, Kapidan Mark Gjomarkaj, with full support of his father Kapidan Gjon, founded the \\"National Independent Group\\" in Shkodra, which he developed through his own political activity. =Exile in Rome= Overpowered by the communists, he was forced to leave his Mirdita under the escort of his second eldest son Ndue. In Kastrat, on November 27, 1944, he gave farewell to his crew including his sons Mark and Llesh who would stay behind and continue the fight. Accompanied by his son Ndue, he was forced to leave behind his sons Mark and Llesh to continue the fight against the partisans. They both died in combat; Mark on 14 June 1946 and Llesh on 9 August 1947. Gjon Marka Gjoni, collaborated with the Albanian publicist and writer Ernest Koliqi, in sketching a political organization in exile. This organization was named \\"Independent National Bloc\\", which was formed on 6 November 1946, in Rome. Professor Ernest Koliqi, in an article published in Shejzat on 6 May 1966 wrote on behalf of Markagjoni: \\"Those who lived near the Kapidan and were fortunate to meet and serve him, will always remember his generosity and sharpness. He was lovingly surrounded by us and we will always be thankful that he participated in our discussions without ever missing a word. He always offered sincere and wise advice and always managed to mesmerize us with his insight. He was a man who understood everything with a magnificently sharp memory. We will always remember his noble face, full of kindness. We will always remember him as noble and sensitive. Even after years of suffering, his thoughts were always clear and lucid. Everyone around him was always impressed with his stories of the old world and we were all amazed at the clarity of his memory.\\" Kapidan Gjon lived in Rome with his son Ndue, his daughter-in-law Maria Teresa and three granddaughters: Maria Cristina, Bianca Maria and Alessandra. He became seriously ill in 1960. He recovered and he was in relatively good health until 1964, when his illness returned. This illness would keep him hospitalized for two years. He died on 28 April 1966. He was buried in Rome on 30 April 1966. His funeral was attended by many dignitaries, scholars and friends. Telegrams and condolences were sent by Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, Cardinal Antoniutti and Francesco Jacomoni, among others.

Common names for it include long-leaved wattle, acacia trinervis, aroma doble, golden wattle, coast wattle, sallow wattle and Sydney golden wattle. It is not listed as being a threatened species,Australian Plant Name Index: Acacia longifolia and is considered invasive in Portugal and South Africa.Vespa australiana pode ajudar a reduzir invas√£o das ac√°cias In the southern region of Western Australia, it has become naturalised and has been classed as a weed by out-competing indigenous species. It is a tree that grows very quickly reaching 7‚Äì10 m in five to six years.Warringah Online Description Golden wattle occurs as both a shrub or tree that can reach a height of up to . It has smooth to finely fissured greyish coloured bark and glabrous branchlets that are angled towards the apices. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen and glabrous phyllodes are mostly straight but occasionally slightly curved with a length of and a width of and have numerous prominent longitudinal veins. It blooms between June and October in its native range producing simple inflorescences that occur singly or in pairs in the phyllode axils on stalks with a length of less than . The cylindrical flower-spikes have a length of packed with bright to pale yellow coloured flowers. Following flowering thinly leathery to firmly papery seed pods form that are straight to strongly twisted and raised over and constricted between each of the seeds. The pods are usually in length and and reasonably brittle when dry.  Taxonomy  The species was first formally described by Henry Cranke Andrews in 1802 as Mimosa longifolia in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants then in 1806 as Acacia longifolia in the Carl Ludwig Willdenow publication Species Plantarum. It was reclassified as Racosperma longifolium in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. Other synonyms include Mimosa macrostachya and Phyllodoce longifolia. The specific epithet refers to the long phyllodes on this species. There are two recognised subspecies: *Acacia longifolia subsp. longifolia *Acacia longifolia subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court Distribution The species is endemic to coastal area of south eastern Queensland close to the border with New South Wales extending southward down the coast of New South Wales. In New South Wales it is common along the tablelands and coastal areas where it is situated in various habitats including foredunes and is usually a part of sclerophyll woodland or coastal heath and scrub communities. The range then extends south and east through Victoria and into South Australia. In South Australia it is found on the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, southern Lofty Ranges and throughout the south eastern region where it is mostly restricted to sand dunes. It has become naturalised in the south west of Western Australia in coastal areas extending from around Perth in the north down to around Albany in the south. It is thought to have introduced by escaping from gardens and being used in restoration plantings. Control methods include hand pulling seedlings and ringbarking or using glyphosate on older plants.  Uses  Acacia longifolia is widely cultivated in subtropical regions of the world. Its uses include prevention of soil erosion, food (flowers, seeds and seed pods), yellow dye (from the flowers), green dye (pods) and wood.Plants for a Future: Acacia longifolia The flower colour derives from the organic compound kaempferol.Lycaeum: Phytochemistry Intro The tree's bark has limited use in tanning, primarily for sheepskin. It is useful for securing uninhabited sand in coastal areas, primarily where there are not too many hard frosts. In Tasmania the ripening pods were roasted and the seeds removed and eaten. Young galls of Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, still showing the branch morphology of the galled buds. One of the phyllodes already seems to be showing stress and might be expected to drop within a few weeks or months. Cultivation The shrub is available commercially and can be propagated by seed scarification or boiling water treatment. It is regarded as an attractive, hardy, fast-growing species suitable as a hedge plant or for screening. Suitable for hydroseeding work on banks where it will provide soil stabilization. Sydney golden wattle is well suited for low maintenance areas such as road batters, will grow in a range of soil types and is frost hardy. Control In South Africa at least, the Pteromalid wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae has been introduced from Australia, and has spread rapidly, achieving substantial control.Dennill, G.B. ; The effect of the gall wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) on reproductive potential and vegetative growth of the weed Acacia longifolia; Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, Volume 14, Issues 1-2, November 1985, Pages 53-61 The effect on the trees has been described as drastic seed reduction (typically over 90%) by galling of reproductive buds, and indirect debilitation of the affected plant by increased abscission of inflorescences adjacent to the growing galls. The presence of galls also caused leaf abscission, reducing vegetative growth as well as reproductive output.

The player can choose from many characters and many mountain bikes ranging from mediocre to excellent in many categories. It was the first game to support the Life Fitness Entertainment System, an exercise bike peripheral for the Super Nintendo. The Cannondale Cup release has the same graphics as the Mountain Bike Rally release, but the names of the racers, bikes, and locations were all altered. Gameplay The player starts in qualifying, and can eventually qualify for the regionals, nationals, the championship, and the final race, in which they must get first place in order to beat the game. There are a selection of cyclists, including a demon, a California surfer, and a ninja. Each character has a different catchphrase for winning, being in first, being in second, being in third, and everything in between. The only violence in this game comes from the onlookers who throw objects at the bikers to cause damage. Even after being hit several times, the bike is never destroyed. Finding a repair bonus on the track can fix the damage and make the bicycle run faster again. There are also bonuses on the track for points and energy, which gives the player more strength to push the bicycle to the limits. Reception GamePro gave the game a generally positive review, saying it \\"mixes racing realism and surrealism.\\" They criticized the lack of digitized voices but praised the Mode 7 effects, airborne animations, numerous options, and good controls.

It was traditionally made from parts of the pig, offal such as heart, lungs and tongue, that wouldn't be used for other sausages. Because offal was used, the sausage would start being made right away as soon as the pig was slaughtered so that the taste of the offal would be at its freshest. The offal is boiled for a few hours, then chopped up, seasoned and spiced. Spices used include cloves, star anise, cinnamon, nutmeg, fennel, and garlic. Then, pig's blood is added. The exact ingredients and proportions can vary by taste and family. It is then formed into a sausage, using the pig's bladder or stomach as casing. The sausage is simmered for about 4 hours, then let cool, with weights on top to press out the fat. It can be preserved in lard for 5 to 6 months, or eaten fresh within 8 to 10 days. Biroldo made in Garfagnana, Lucca, Tuscany differs from that made in the rest of the province of Lucca in that in Garfagnana the head is also used. This Biroldo made in Garfagnana is sometimes called Biroldo della Versilia, named after the Versilian Riviera, which is the strip of Tuscan coast starting at Forte dei Marmi in Lucca and stretching down 20 km south to Torre del Lago Puccini.

Though an obscure figure today, he was a renowned mathematician during his lifetime, and was even consulted by Pope Gregory XIII on his new calendar. He held the mathematics chair at the University of Padua, preceding Galileo, who had sent him his theorems on the centre of gravity. Dialogo intorno alla Meccanica In his Dialogo intorno alla Meccanica (Dialogue on Mechanics), Moletti \\"intended to establish its Euclidean foundations...[and] to extend mechanics generally to explain all motions through the analysis of their forces and resistances\\".Preface, The Unfinished Mechanics of Giuseppe Moletti... by W.R. Laird He defined mechanics as the science of overcoming greater forces with smaller ones. On the first day of dialogue, he offers geometrical foundations for Archytas‚Äô (Pseudo-Aristotles) mechanics, establishing the principle that the further a weight is from the centre of a pivoting lever, the less force is required to move it in a circular motion. He used geometry and angles of force to discuss and solve mechanical problems. He thereby sought to relate motion to mathematical laws, though he did not envision mathematics as a universal science of motion. The second day discusses problems of natural philosophy, especially the acceleration of falling bodies. Other Works Moletti was a prolific writer, though many of his writings remained unpublished. He lived in the generation before Galileo and anticipated Galileo's experiments that heavy bodies of different weights fell at the same rate. Also that ‚Äúwhat makes a body hard to move also makes it hard to stop‚Äù, which is related to its mass, and to what later became the law of inertia. He also wrote a book of astronomical tables, another on mathematical certainty, and a work on reform of the calendar. His unpublished notes contain commentaries on Euclid's Elements, Archimedes‚Äô Sphere and Cylinder, Alhazen's Optics, Sacrobosco's Tractatus de Sphaera, Archytas‚Äô (Pseudo-Aristotles') Mechanika and Copernicus' De revolutionibus. He was also working on an introduction to astrology, and on the celestial spheres.

Their long-term members were Jonas Bahlo on bass guitar and backing vocals, Callan Hughes on lead vocals, Daniel Luttick on drums and Vincent Zylstra on lead guitar and backing vocals. They issued two studio albums, Catatonic (April 2008) and Perpetual Motion Machine (October 2010). History Synthetic Breed originated as a four-piece industrial death metal band with Vincent Zylstra and Reza Nasseri on lead guitars, Jonas Bahlo on bass guitar and Mark Condello on lead vocals. Nick Bose on drums joined and left the band a number of times, but never actually played drums live. By March 2004 Daniel Luttick became their drummer. The line up lasted two shows: after the show at EV's Metalfest, the band played one more show at the Green Room in Melbourne before Condello left the band. In October 2004 Synthetic Breed were on stage with Nasseri also on vocal duties, but on 13 April 2005 Callan Hughes joined on lead vocals for his first show with the band. Synthetic Breed supported Swedish metal group Arch Enemy on their Australian tour. The Australian group released their second extended play, Fractured, in November 2005. David Stonehouse of The Sydney Morning Herald, described their style as \\"Psychotic blasts of biomechanical fury, pulsing poly-rhythms and metronomic precision\\". thedwarf.com.aus Josh L observed, \\"While most bands would try dominating the local scene before taking on the world, Synthetic Breed seem like a band that have firmly set their goals and know what route they plan to take in order to achieve them.\\" After an appearance at the With Full Force Festival (Leipzig, Germany) in 2006, Nasseri left and was eventually replaced by Darcy Mildren on guitar. The band signed with Faultline Records for the release of debut full- length album, Catatonic (April 2008). Justin Donnelly of MediaSearch compared it to their earlier extended plays, \\"the melodic component of the songs has definitely improved, with the layered vocal performances sounding more thought out and defining, rather than simply sounding like an afterthought that counterbalances the heavier side of the band‚Äôs sound.\\" During that year Mildren departed and the band returned to a four-piece. Synthetic Breed released their second full-length album, Perpetual Motion Machine, in October 2010 while they were on a live performance hiatus. Buzz Magazine Australias Rod Whitfield rated it at four out-of five stars and compared it to their previous studio album, \\"it's probably best to view the new record in isolation, and try your utmost not to compare... their quirky and unique trademarks are still present in droves, but the changes go beyond the mere cosmetic.\\" Synthetic Breed undertook the Perpetual Motion Machine tour across Australia in 2011. For the tour both Bahlo and Hughes departed and were replaced by Luke Thiel (bass guitar) and Mares Refalaeda ( Mary Lawton, vocals) respectively. Refalaeda co-wrote the track, \\"Zero Degrees Freedom\\", with Luttick and Zylstra for the EP of the same name, which was issued in May 2012. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' Whitfield, now writing for Beat Magazine, caught up with the group in early 2012, \\"Their lineup is solid and strong, after a period of instability, and the last twelve months has seen them sign to an American label, re-release their first two albums Stateside and traverse our mighty nation several times. The way ahead now seems very clear, and the next 12 months looks to be even more hectic for this world class Australian heavy act.\\" In mid-2012 Thiel and Refalaeda left,[got- djent.com/.../synthetic-breed-part-ways-bass-player-and-vocalist \\"Synthetic Breed Part Ways with Bass Player and Vocalist\\"] and by September Bahlo and Hughes had returned. Synthetic Breed were working on a third full-length album during 2013.\\"Synthetic Breed and Callan Hughes Reunite\\" However, their official website showed no new activity from early 2014. By June of that year Zylstra was working on a collaborative album, Project Rogue ‚Äì Titans, seeking crowdfunding. Jonas Bahlo was teaching English and German at a secondary college in Melbourne.

Yonec is a Breton lai, a type of narrative poem. The poem is written in the Anglo-Norman dialect of Old French in rhyming couplets of eight syllables each. This lai tells the story of a woman who seeks to escape a loveless marriage, and of the child born from the love that she found elsewhere. Plot summary The lord of Caerwent, a rich old man, marries a beautiful young woman. He fears that she will be unfaithful to him, so he imprisons her in a tower and assigns his aged sister to watch over her. As the years go by, she laments her situation and stops taking care of herself, making her beauty fade away. One day, she cries out to God, wishing that she could experience a romantic adventure as she has heard in fairy tales. Suddenly, a dark bird resembling a goshawk appears at her window. The bird transforms into a handsome knight named Muldumarec. Muldumarec declares his love for her and reveals that, while he has loved her from afar, he could only approach her once she had called for him. The woman refuses his advances unless he can prove that he was not sent by the devil to lead her astray. Muldumarec says that he is a Christian, and as proof of such, he assumes the woman's shape and receives the Eucharist. When the rich lord is away, the knight arrives by the window, in the same way he first appeared. The woman glows with her newfound love. The other people of the household become suspicious of her renewed beauty and put her under discreet surveillance. When the jealous husband learns of the shapechanging knight, he surrounds the window with iron spikes. The next time the knight arrives, he is mortally wounded. He tells the woman that their unborn child, whom she is to name \\"Yonec\\", will grow up to avenge their deaths. The knight flies away, and the woman hurls herself from the window and follows a trail of blood to a city made of silver. After passing through a succession of rooms, she eventually finds the knight on his deathbed. He gives her a magic ring that will make her husband forget about her infidelity. He also gives her his sword. As the woman flees the city, she hears the bells tolling for her lover's death. As prophesied, the lady gives birth to a child, and names him \\"Yonec\\". When the child is grown, the husband, the lady, and Yonec travel to an abbey, where they see a beautiful tomb. They ask the abbot about the tomb, who explains that this is the tomb of Muldumarec. At this time, Yonec's mother tells him of his true parentage, and gives him his father's sword. She collapses and dies. Yonec kills his stepfather with the sword, thus avenging his real parents. He buries his mother alongside his father, and Yonec becomes the new lord of Caerwent. Motifs The motif of a lover visiting in the form of a bird draws upon a common folklore motif, as in Child ballad 270, The Earl of Mar's Daughter.Helen Child Sargent, ed; George Lymn Kittredge, ed English and Scottish Popular Ballads: Cambridge Edition p 586 Houghton Mifflin Company Boston 1904 It also features in the Italian fairy tale The Canary Prince.Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 719 The folklorist Alexander Hagerty Krappe (1894-1947) Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 61, No. 240 (Apr. - Jun., 1948), pp. 201-202 discusses the Yonec lai in his book Balor With the Evil Eye: Studies in Celtic and French Literature (1927). Krappe believes it comes from a very ancient myth, perhaps, he suggests, going back to fertility rites at the time of the introduction of agriculture, of a woman (the earth) shut away by an old man (the old year), impregnated by another man, whose child (the new year), then kills the old man. Other versions of this myth: Gilgamesh, Osiris, Balder, Dana√´, Balor in Ireland, the \\"May Count\\" in Sweden, and \\"it has even penetrated to Uganda, where it is told of a local chief.\\"J.A. MacCulloch, The Childhood of Fiction,\\" London, 1905, p. 411 Krappe concludes, \\"The lay of Yonec is but a Christian and courtly version of the Irish myth of Balor in the form in which it was still current in Ireland at the time of the Norman conquest. But it was adapted to the civilisation of Mediaeval France and England and at the same time contaminated with the M√§rchen of the Jealous Stepmother.\\" Yonec has been compared to the lai of Tydorel because both include noblewoman who is visited and impregnated by a supernatural fairy- knight who then names the child.

It was performed on Saturday 22 February 1617, and was significant in the development and acceptance of opera in seventeenth-century England. Background The Lord Hay in question was James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, one of the early favorites of King James I. Through 1616 Hay had been involved in a major diplomatic embassy to the court of Henri IV in Paris, where Hay had negotiated a potential marriage between James's son and heir Prince Charles, the future Charles I, and a daughter of the French king. (The negotiations were not fruitful in 1616, though a decade later Charles would marry Henri's daughter Henrietta Maria of France.) Hay's embassy was characterized by extraordinary lavish banquets, masques, processions and shows of all types -- a pattern of indulgence that continued when Hay returned to Britain. Lovers Made Men was one of the shows of this period; Lord Hay used it to welcome and entertain the French Ambassador, the Baron de Tour. The performance of the masque was organized for Lord Hay by Jonson's patron Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. The show As the subtitle of the work indicates, Jonson set his masque on the shores of the river Lethe in the underworld of ancient Greek mythology. As the masque begins, Charon the ferryman has just dropped off a group of human figures, \\"imagined ghosts,\\" to be received by Mercury. The Fates, however, complain that these people are not actually dead; they have been deluded through the influence of Cupid to think that they have \\"drown'd in Love.\\" By drinking the waters of Lethe, the deluded lovers paradoxically forget their Cupid-imposed delusions and return to mental health. Thus the lovers are \\"made men\\" once again. The masque is a relatively brief work, and featured only a single perspective stage set; by Inigo Jones's standards of masque design, it was a fairly spare production. Jonson's masque ends with a reconciliation of love and wisdom. Another masque writer, Robert White, took a different tack in his Cupid's Banishment, produced later in 1617; in his work, as the title indicates, Cupid is regarded as too disruptive an influence to be accepted. Jonson in turn may have answered White's masque in his Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue (1618).Robert C. Evans, Jonson and the Contexts of His Time, Lewisburg, PA, Bucknell University Press, 1994; p. 98. The music The most notable aspect of the masque was its musical form. \\"The whole masque was sung after the Italian manner stylo recitativo, by Master Nicholas Lanier; who ordered and made both the scene and the music.\\"William Gifford, ed., The Works of Ben Jonson, Vol. 7, London, Bickers and Son, 1875; p. 274. The claim is controversial; it does not occur in the original 1617 quarto publication of Jonson's text, but only in the 1641 second folio.Mary Chan, Music in the Theatre of Ben Jonson, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1980; pp. 273-4. Sir William Davenant's The Siege of Rhodes (1656) is widely acclaimed as \\"the first English opera;\\" but Davenant's work had several precursors. If Lanier's Lovers Made Men featured through-and-through recitatives, it would certainly qualify as one. Nicholas Lanier's 1628 musical setting for Marlowe's Hero and Leander may have been a comparable work; it is unfortunate that Lanier's music for these works has not survived the centuries.George J. Buelow, A History of Baroque Music, Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 2004; p. 327. Publication As noted above, Jonson's text for Lovers Made Men was published in quarto soon after its 1617 staging. A second quarto was issued in 1622, and the text was included in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641.

In the manga and its adaptations, Haruhi takes on the role of a male host with a comical tsukkomi- archetype, despite being of female sex; keeping her sex secret from the host club's female clients. While their fellow, all-male Host Club members know the truth, the host club's female clients either do not, or are mistaken in believing Haruhi to be a boy, thus providing the basis for much of the satire embedded in the comedy.https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2018/02/josou.htmlhttps://www.tanoshiijapanese.com/dictionary/entry_details.cfm?entry_id=40425#:~:text=English%20Meaning(s)%20for%20%E7%94%B7%E8%A3%85,disguising%20oneself%20as%20a%20man Haruhi's character was positively received, both because of their down-to- earth personality and their \\"gender-blind attitude\\" towards life. Character Haruna Kawaguchi was sixteen years old when she portrayed Haruhi in her first feature-length film. Caitlin Glass, who voices the character in English, referred to her work in Ouran as a passion project. At the start of the Ouran High School Host Club manga and anime, Haruhi enters the prestigious Ouran Academy on a scholarship. Looking for a quiet place to study, she stumbles upon the school's male-only host club, where she is initially mistaken for a boy due to her short hair and gender-neutral clothing. After knocking over an expensive vase, the club forces her to work off her debt by becoming a host. Having a \\"low perception of gender\\", Haruhi is able to join the club, keeping her sex secret from the club's clientele. At the beginning of the story, Haruhi dislikes being forced to work for the host club. However, as the plot advances, Haruhi slowly grows less introverted and starts to realize that the boys of the host club have become her best friends who are helping her learn and grow to be a better person. The episodes consist of comedic explorations of shoujo clich√©s and gender performance. Unlike other shoujo heroines that Ouran High School Host Club parodies, Haruhi is an independent, hard-working asocial tsukkomi-type character who \\"embraces, if not a genderqueer identity, then at least a gender-ambivalent one.\\" Development Caitlin Glass, the English voice actress of Haruhi, has noted that the character is both among her most challenging and her favorite roles. In an interview with Swerve, she described how difficult it was to \\"believably [be] a boy [while] still appealing even to a male audience.\\" Taking the dual role of director and lead character, Glass said she felt like she had \\"something to prove\\" and, initially, she was under great pressure. Reception Afro Samurai of IGN listed Haruhi among his 25 \\"greatest anime characters\\". Stating that while the reverse harem genre of anime had been \\"done to death\\" by the time the Ouran High School Host Club anime was released, Haruhi's character went against the established tropes of the genre. Described as \\"super tomboyish, demure, and not at all moe,\\" Haruhi is considered a good contrast to the eccentric cast of rich boys. In an anime review, IGNs D.F. Smith praised both Caitlin Glass and Maaya Sakamoto for their performance as Haruhi in their respective languages, reporting that it is a \\"tricky role\\". Sakamoto was nominated for a Seiyu Award in 2007 for her portrayal of Haruhi. Rose Bridges of Anime News Network lauded Haruhi as one of the \\"freshest elements\\" of the anime. Comparing Haruhi to Tohru Honda from Fruits Basket and Tsukushi Makino from Boys Over Flowers because of her strong sense of empathy and her \\"take-no-crap\\" attitude respectively, Bridges praised the character for her intelligence, ability to speak her mind and her \\"blas√© approach to gender roles.\\" Writing for The Mary Sue, Alenka Figa listed Haruhi at the top of her top five queer characters in anime. Noting that plots based on gender confusion are common in anime, Figa states that the trope was subverted quickly when Haruhi admits to her gender-blindness in the first episode. Aja Romano of The Daily Dot also pointed Haruhi out as one of the \\"rare cases\\" where a character in an anime embraces a genderqueer or \\"gender- ambivalent\\" identity, refusing to return to what she described as \\"safely heteronormative territory.\\" Mangaka Bisco Hatori appeared at Anime Expo 2019 held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, California, USA. When questioned about Haruhi Fujioka, she revealed that Haruhi was originally meant to be a boy, but one of her editors suggested a gender swap. Thus, Hatori invented a female character that \\"doesn't need to dress up like a boy other than the fact that those are the clothing she wears and likes\\" without subtext. She expressed that she isn't hung up on genre parameters or gender orientation because every person should be proud of being unique while remaining true to themselves. In summation, Hatori stressed Ouran being a story about family and friendship, without any intention of being a pioneer of \\"fujoshi comedy,\\" though admits that it happened just the same.Ortiz, Alfonso \\"Fonzy\\" (2020-17-19). \\"Bisco Hatori at Anime Expo 2019\\".

Function  This gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates interaction between newly assembled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which is required for the transport of antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This interaction facilitates optimal peptide loading on the MHC class I molecule. Up to four complexes of MHC class I and tapasin may be bound to a single TAP molecule. Tapasin contains a C-terminal double-lysine motif (KKKAE) known to maintain membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. In humans, the tapasin gene lies within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6. Alternative splicing results in three transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Tapasin is a MHC class I antigen-processing molecule present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays an important role in the maturation of MHC class I molecules in the ER lumen. Tapasin is one component of the peptide-loading complex, and can be found associated with MHC class I molecules after the MHC class I heavy chain has associated with Beta2 microglobulin. The peptide-loading complex consists of TAP, tapasin, MHC class I, calreticulin, and ERp57. Tapasin recruits MHC class I molecules to the TAP peptide transporter, and also enhances loading of MHC class I with high- affinity peptides. Following loading of MHC class I with a high-affinity ligand, the interaction between tapasin and MHC class I disappears.

The story is based on an ancient Indian folk tale of the same title with translations by Attipat Krishnaswami Ramanujan.Boosey & Hawkes, A Flowering Tree accessed 28 November 2014 The opera resembles Mozart's The Magic Flute in some ways; both operas adapt folk tales, in this case one from southern India, \\"describing a young couple undergoing rituals and trials to discover the transfiguring power of love.\\" This parallel was intended by the composer as the opera was commissioned to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart‚Äôs birth. It is set for a small cast of three singers (baritone for the narrator, tenor for the prince, and lyric soprano for Kamudha), a large chorus (SATB), and three dancers. It premiered on 14 November 2006 in the MuseumsQuartier Halle E in Vienna with Eric Owens as the narrator, Russell Thomas as the prince, Jessica Rivera as Kumudha, Orquesta Joven Camerata de Venezuela and the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela all under the direction of John Adams in a production of Peter Sellars co-commissioned by New Crowned Hope. Performance history In February 2015, James Darrah directed a new production of A Flowering Tree for Opera Omaha conducted by Christopher Rountree. Synopsis Kumudha, a beautiful young woman who comes from an impoverished family, is worried about her old and suffering mother. Kumudha discovers that she has the magical ability to transform herself into a flowering tree. With the help of her sisters, Kumudha turns herself into a tree with the intent that her sisters gather and sell the flowers from her branches. Her sisters gather the flowers off the tree and Kumudha returns to her human form. They sell the flowers in the local marketplace and return to their mother who receives the money with no explanation from her daughters. Kumudha and her sisters decide to once again sell flowers and she transforms into a tree yet again. The transformation is witnessed by a young Prince who is concealed in a nearby tree. He is at once infatuated and disturbed by Kumudha's magic and beauty. He resolves to marry Kumudha and upon returning to the palace convinces his father, the King, to order Kumudha to be brought to the palace so that he can marry her. Following their wedding the Prince becomes silent and sullen and, to the distress of Kumudha, the couple spends several nights without speaking or touching each other. The silence is finally broken when the Prince reveals he knows about Kumudha's magic and demands that she transform for him. Ashamed, Kumudha resists but eventually gives in. Meanwhile, out of jealousy the Prince‚Äôs sister has spied on Kumudha and the prince witnessing her transformation. When the Prince leaves the next day she taunts Kumudha and commands her to transform for her wealthy young friends. Reluctantly, Kumudha agrees. In the midst of the ritual however, the princess and her friends lose interest and leave. By breaking the magical ritual Kumudha is stuck in an in-between state where she is not entirely tree or entirely human. Now a hideous creature, Kumudha crawls into a gutter, where she is found by a wandering band of minstrels. Upon returning to the court, the Prince discovers his wife is missing. When he does not find her he assumes that his arrogance has driven her away. Feeling guilt and remorse, the prince decides to become a wandering beggar and mute in order to punish himself. After several years pass, the prince stumbles into the palace courtyard of a distant city where his sister is now a Queen. He is haggard and almost unrecognizable, but the Queen recognizes her brother and brings him into the palace where she bathes and feeds him. The prince, however, will not speak to her and is despondent. In the town marketplace, several of the queen‚Äôs maids see the minstrel troupe and hear the beautiful singing of a freakish thing with neither hands nor feet. They bring this strange and misshapen torso to the palace and suggest that its beautiful singing might revive the Prince. Not knowing that this is Kumudha, the Queen orders her to be bathed and covered with scented oils and brought to the Prince‚Äôs bed. Alone, Kumudha and Prince recognize one another. They are both overcome with grief and then with joy. He takes two pitchers of water and performs the old ceremony. Kumudha returns to her human form.

The method is a generalization of the classical method of Lagrange multipliers as used to find extrema of a function of finitely many variables. The Lagrange multiplier theorem for Banach spaces Let X and Y be real Banach spaces. Let U be an open subset of X and let f : U ‚Üí R be a continuously differentiable function. Let g : U ‚Üí Y be another continuously differentiable function, the constraint: the objective is to find the extremal points (maxima or minima) of f subject to the constraint that g is zero. Suppose that u0 is a constrained extremum of f, i.e. an extremum of f on :g^{-1} (0) = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in U \\\\mid g(x) = 0 \\\\in Y \\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq U. Suppose also that the Fr√©chet derivative Dg(u0) : X ‚Üí Y of g at u0 is a surjective linear map. Then there exists a Lagrange multiplier Œª : Y ‚Üí R in Y‚àó, the dual space to Y, such that :\\\\mathrm{D} f (u_{0}) = \\\\lambda \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{D} g (u_{0}). \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(L)} Since Df(u0) is an element of the dual space X‚àó, equation (L) can also be written as :\\\\mathrm{D} f (u_{0}) = \\\\left( \\\\mathrm{D} g (u_{0}) \\\\right)^{*} (\\\\lambda), where (Dg(u0))‚àó(Œª) is the pullback of Œª by Dg(u0), i.e. the action of the adjoint map (Dg(u0))‚àó on Œª, as defined by :\\\\left( \\\\mathrm{D} g (u_{0}) \\\\right)^{*} (\\\\lambda) = \\\\lambda \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{D} g (u_{0}). Connection to the finite-dimensional case In the case that X and Y are both finite-dimensional (i.e. linearly isomorphic to Rm and Rn for some natural numbers m and n) then writing out equation (L) in matrix form shows that Œª is the usual Lagrange multiplier vector; in the case n = 1, Œª is the usual Lagrange multiplier, a real number. Application In many optimization problems, one seeks to minimize a functional defined on an infinite-dimensional space such as a Banach space. Consider, for example, the Sobolev space X = H_0^1([-1,+1];\\\\mathbb{R}) and the functional f : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} given by :f(u) = \\\\int_{-1}^{+1} u'(x)^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x. Without any constraint, the minimum value of f would be 0, attained by u0(x) = 0 for all x between ‚àí1 and +1. One could also consider the constrained optimization problem, to minimize f among all those u ‚àà X such that the mean value of u is +1. In terms of the above theorem, the constraint g would be given by :g(u) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_{-1}^{+1} u(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x - 1. However this problem can be solved as in the finite dimensional case since the Lagrange multiplier \\\\lambda is only a scalar.

Enamel tufts are hypomineralized ribbon-like structures that run longitudinally to the tooth axis and extend from the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) one fifth to a third into the enamel.

These defects as they pass through the enamel rods to the surface become progressively more fragmented and fibrillar. Scanning electron micrography finds that there are two kinds: one that is continuous with the enamel-dentine membrane at the dentinoenamel junction and that is acid-resistant, and another that is made up of empty spaces between the prisms and hard walls covered with organic matter. Enamel tufts are particularly common on low-crowned, blunt-cusped molars used in crushing; these are called \\"bunodonts\\". Development The origin of enamel tufts is not fully understood. It appears, however, that they may arise during enamel development in areas where enamel rods are crowded at the boundaries where they are bundled together, creating periodic weakened mineral reduced planes. These weaknesses then produce transient longitudinal cracks in the transverse plane of the developing enamel. Their formation has been attributed to stress and are considered a form of defect. However, stress upon the enamel is not needed to produce them since they occur in impacted third molars that are not affected by biting forces. Enamel fractures Some sources consider them to be of no clinical significance.Histology Course Notes: \\"Mature Enamel\\", New Jersey Dental School, 2003-2004, page 2. However, they have been noted to be an important potential source of enamel fractures that arise after extended use or overloading. It appears that, although enamel easily starts to form the fracture defects of enamel tufts, they then enable enamel to resist the further progress of these fractures, ultimately preventing mechanical failure. This fracture resistance is why tooth enamel is three times stronger than its constituent hydroxyapatite crystallites that make up its enamel rods. Enamel tufts do not normally lead to enamel failure, due to these defects stabilizing potential fractures. The processes involved include them creating ‚Äò‚Äòstress shielding‚Äô‚Äô by increasing the compliance of enamel next to the dentin. Decussation is another factor by which cracks form wavy stepwise extensions that arrest their further development. Enamel tufts also self-heal through a process of being filled with protein rich fluids. Odontologically they can be filled by light-cured composite resin when applied in two applications. Animals with enamel tufts While a common feature of animal dentition, enamel tufts are particularly found in animals that crush hard materials with their teeth such as nuts and mollusc shells. Tufts are found especially in the enamel of primates such as chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. They are also found in bears, pigs, peccaries, and sea otters. Biomimicry importance Enamel is as brittle as glass and yet it can constantly withstand bite forces during chewing as high as 1,000 N many times a day. As such, it has been argued, that enamel tufts is an example of how nature has created a biomechanical solution to the problem of weak internal interfaces that laminate structures would otherwise have. The solutions involved (such as filling growing defects with fluids) has inspired scientists to make novel bioinspired (or biomimicry) materials. Not to be confused with Enamel tufts are frequently confused with enamel lamellae, which are also enamel defects, but which differ in two ways: lamella are linear, and not branched, and they exist primarily extending from the enamel surface, through the enamel and towards the dentinoenamel junction, whereas enamel tufts project in the opposite direction. Enamel tufts should also not be confused with the similar enamel spindles. Enamel spindles are also linear defects, similar to lamellae, but they too can be found only at the dentinoenamel junction, similar to enamel tufts. This is because they are formed by entrapment of odontoblast processes between ameloblasts prior to and during amelogenesis.

Career In the early 1970s, she was directed by then-husband and Manhattan theatre owner Don Schain in a series of softcore sexploitation action films, most notably the \\"Ginger\\" trilogy, consisting of Ginger, The Abductors and Girls Are For Loving. Caffaro played Ginger McAllister, a tough and resourceful bed-hopping private-eye and spy. Her missions involved busting up seedy wrongdoers involved in drugs, prostitution and white slavery. Her character also spends an inordinate amount of time bound and gagged and/or raped. She also appeared in A Place Called Today and Too Hot To Handle (both also directed by Schain). She was quickly stereotyped, became disenchanted with the direction her film career had taken and, like Bettie Page before her, disappeared from the public eye. She has also been credited with an appearance on the TV show Baretta, and as a writer and producer of the 1979 sex comedy H.O.T.S. Her last screen credit is noted as a character voice in an episode of the 1997 animated TV series Extreme Ghostbusters.

It also reported an Indecent Assault on a student and 25 incidents of fighting. The Ringgold School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online.] All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007‚Äì2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 506 pupils or 15.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal laws, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the Ringgold School District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Ringgold School District received a $1,913,736 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 145 or 4.60% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to a variety of AP courses. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2007, the district employed 227 teachers with the average teacher salary in the district at $44,398 for 180 days worked.Fenton, Jacob, Average classroom teacher salary in Washington County, 2006-07. The Morning Call. Accessed April 2010. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, personal days, sick days, and other benefits.Ringgold Professional Education Association Employment Contract 2009 The district administrative costs in 2008 were $707.74 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob. Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money? , The Morning Call, Feb 2009. In 2007, the school board awarded a four-year contract to Gary Hamilton to serve as the district's superintendent. His initial salary was set at $120,000 with incentives.Oliver, Jeff, Ringgold's Hamilton gets 4-year contract. Valley independent. April 18, 2007 He also received an extensive benefits package. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association, the average salary for a superintendent for the 2007-08 school year was $122,165.Public School Employee Salaries 2007-08 - 11th Annual, Pennsylvania School Board Association, October 2009 In 2008, the district administration reported spending $11,029 per pupil which ranked 394th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In April 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the administration and the school board by state officials. Reserves In 2008, the district reported a $2,863,447 in an unreserved- undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as zero. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= In 2011‚Äì12, the district will receive $12,097,472 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district will receive $239,985 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011‚Äì2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010‚Äì2011. In 2010 the district reported that 1,250 pupils received a free or reduced-price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty levels. For the 2010‚Äì11 budget year, the Ringgold School District was allotted a 5.86% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $13,373,336. This was an increase of $740,495 over the previous year's funding from the Commonwealth. The highest increase in Washington County was provided to Charleroi School District which received a 9.90% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in the state, in 2010‚Äì11, went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding.PA Basic Education Funding-Printout2 2010‚Äì2011 Pennsylvania House Appropriations Committee Education Budget information. The amount of increase each school district receives is set by the Governor and the Secretary of Education as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 3.95% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $11,603,644. The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $11,163,203.29. In Washington County, the highest increase went to Burgettstown Area School District at 6.45%. The Pennsylvania Department of Education gave 15 school districts an increase of Basic Education Funding in excess of 10% in the 2009 - 10 budget. The highest increase in the commonwealth went to Muhlenberg School District in Berks County which received a 22.31% increase in state BEF for 2009-10.Pennsylvania Department of Education Basic Education Funding Report, October 2009 The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the per district allocation, in the Commonwealth budget proposal made in February each year. The Department of Education reported that 1,145 students, attending school at the Ringgold School District, received a free or reduced-price lunch in 2007 due to low family income. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010‚Äì11 the district applied for and received $651,379, in addition to all other state and federal funding. The Ringgold School District uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten and to implement research based school improvement programs. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006‚Äì2009. Ringgold School District did not apply for funding in 2006‚Äì07. In 2007‚Äì08, it received $361,252. In 2008‚Äì09, the district received $65,742 for a total funding of $426,994. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11, Ringgold School District received $222,274. Federal Stimulus grant The district received $2,455,983 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. This funding is for 2009-10 and 2010-2011. school years. Race to the Top Grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district a million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Ringgold School Board decided to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Ringgold School Board set property tax rates in 2011 at 120.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. *2010 - 120.0000 mills. *2009 ‚Äì 117.0000 mills. *2008 ‚Äì 113.0000 mills. *2007 ‚Äì 109.000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index and the adjusted index for each district are publicly announced by the Pennsylvania Department of Education In September each year. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010‚Äì11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Ringgold School District 2006‚Äì2007 through 2011‚Äì2012. *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 5.4%, Base 3.9% *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 4.7%, Base 3.4% *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 6.1%, Base 4.4% *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 5.6%, Base 4.1% *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 4.0%, Base 2.9% *2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 1.9%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, Ringgold School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, Ringgold School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published in the fall of each school year, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Ringgold School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index for the budget year 2010‚Äì2011. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief for 7,726 approved residents of Ringgold School District was set at $158. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Ringgold School District was $159 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 7,682 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Washington County, the highest tax relief went to Washington School District at $407 in 2009 and $414 in 2010. The greatest tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the Chester Upland School District of Delaware County set at $632 in 2009 and $641 in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report 2010. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Washington County, 73% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).

Short racemes of yellow flowers are produced periodically throughout the year. Internet Archive Select Extra-tropical Plants Readily Eligible for Industrial Culture Or Naturalization By Ferdinand von Mueller Some common names are Retinodes water wattle, swamp wattle, wirilda, ever-blooming wattle and silver wattle. Description The tree typically grows to a height of Arthur Lee Jacobson Plant of the Month and is able to form suckers. It has furrowed bark with a rough texture that is dark brown to black in colour. It has glabrous branchlets that are sometimes pendulous or angular or flattened at extremities. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The green to grey-green, glabrous and variable phyllodes are quite crowded on stems and have a narrowly oblanceolate to oblanceolate to linear shape. The phyllodes are in length and wide with one main nerve per face. It mostly blooms in summer between December and February. Acacia retinodes tree Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal in 1847 as part of the work Sudaustralische Pflanzen. II. Bestimmung und Beschreibung der von Dr Behr in Sudaustralien gesammelten Pflanzen as published in the journal Linnaea: ein Journal f√ºr die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beitr√§ge zur Pflanzenkunde. It was reclassified as Racosperma retinodes by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2007. = Varieties = *A. retinodes var. retinodes *A. retinodes var. uncifolia Distribution In South Australia it is endemic to the Mount Lofty Ranges from arounf Mount Clare to Mount Bryan extending down the Fleurieu Peninsula to around Delamere and Normanville in the south and is regarded as a weed further to the south east. It is commonly situated on low ranges and hills as a part of Eucalyptus woodland communities.  Uses  It is used for environmental management and for ornamental purposes. It produces good quantities of gum and its bark is good for tanning. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. In temperate regions it requires a frost-free sheltered spot with full sun. Indigenous Australians ate the gum, after softening it in water, to relieve chest pains.

She was originally the German destroyer V-5.  Service  The ship, along with one of her six sister ships of V-class destroyers, , was ordered from Germany. They were purchased before entering service in the German Navy, from the German shipyard Vulcan AG in Stettin, when the Balkan Wars were underway. Later, during World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the two ex-German V-class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 1917‚Äì18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. With the Armistice in 1918, Keravnos was ordered to Constantinople and later to Russia during the Russian Civil War. According to the Executive Officer, Gregory Mezeviris, RHN, \\"We stayed a few days in Constantinople and then the destroyer Keravnos was ordered to sail to the port of Vatum in the Black Sea. This mission was finally cancelled because after sailing for a few hours we faced such adverse weather conditions that our ship with her defective engines could hardly cope with and we had to put back into port. When the weather conditions improved, we were ordered to sail to Sebastopol to reinforce the Greek Squadron anchored there, comprising the battleship and some destroyers.\\" Mezeviris, Gregory, Four decades in the Service of the R.H.N, Athens (1971) Keravnos was stricken in 1919 and scrapped in 1922.

It is a very different variant from others known in the Arabic language and, although it bears certain similarities with North Mesopotamian Arabic, it is part of the Central Asian family, an independent linguistic branch of the five mainly groups of the Modern Standard Arabic. There is no diglossia with Modern Standard Arabic. It is spoken by an estimated 6,000 people in Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, countries where Arabic is not an official language, and reported to be declining in number. In contrast to all Arab countries, it is not characterized by diglossia; The Arab ethnic group use Uzbek and Persian (including Dari and Tajiki) to communicate with each other, and as literary language; Speakers are reported to be bilingual, others speak these languages as mother tongue, and only few members of the communities now speak Jugari Arabic. History It was once spoken among Central Asia's numerous settled and nomadic Arab communities who moved there after the fall of Sasanian Empire. They inhabited areas in Samarqand, Bukhara, Qashqadarya, Surkhandarya (present-day Uzbekistan), and Khatlon (present-day Tajikistan), as well as Afghanistan. The first wave of Arabs migrated to this region in the 8th century during the Muslim conquests and was later joined by groups of Arabs from Balkh and Andkhoy (present-day Afghanistan). Owing to heavy Islamic influences, Arabic quickly became the common language of science and literature of the epoch. Most Central Asian Arabs lived in isolated communities and did not favour intermarriages with the local population. This factor helped their language survive in a multilingual milieu until the 20th century. By the 1880s many Arab pastoralists had migrated to northern Afghanistan from what is now Uzbekistan and Tajikistan following the Russian conquest of Central Asia. These Arabs nowadays speak no Arabic having adapted to Dari and Uzbek.Peter R. Blood, ed. Afghanistan: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 2001 With the establishment of the Soviet rule in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Arab communities faced major linguistic and identity changes having had to abandon nomadic lifestyles and gradually mixing with Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmen. According to the 1959 census, only 34% of Soviet Arabs, mostly elderly, spoke their language at a native level. Others reported Uzbek or Tajik as their mother tongue. Varieties Giorgi Tsereteli and Isaak Natanovich Vinnikov were responsible for the first academic studies of Central Asian Arabic, which is heavily influenced by the local languages in phonetics, vocabulary and syntax. The Jugari Arabic comprises four varieties: Bakhtiari Arabic (also called Bactrian Arabic), Bukhara Arabic (also called Buxara Arabic), Kashkadarya Arabic and Khorasani Arabic. The first three have their speakers spread across Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Khorasani came to be considered by scholars as part of the Central Asian Arabic dialect family only recently. It is related to be spoken in 5 villages of Surkhandarya, Qashqadarya and Bukhara. In Uzbekistan, there are at least two dialects of Central Asian Arabic: Bukharian (influenced by Tajik) and Qashqadaryavi (influenced by Turkic languages). These dialects are not mutually intelligible. Ethnic Minorities of Uzbekistan: Arabs by Olga Kobzeva In Tajikistan, Central Asian Arabic is spoken by 35.7% of the country's Arab population, having been largely replaced by Tajik. Ethnic Minorities of Tajikistan: Arabs Bakhtiari Arabic is spoken in Arab communities in the northern Afghanistan. Recent studies considered Khorasani Arabic (spoken in Khorasan, Iran) as part of the Central Asian Arabic family, and found that it was closely related to Qashqadaryavi.Ulrich Seeger, On the Relationship of the Central Asian Arabic Dialects (translated from German to English by Sarah Dickins) Numbers * wahid > fad * ithna√¢n > isnen * thalatha > sala√¢s * arba3a > orba3 See also *History of Arabs in Afghanistan *Khoja *:ru:–°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–∞–∑–∏–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–µ –∞—Ä–∞–±—ã - central asian arabs References Sources  * Versteegh, Kees.

The BGAV has been characterized as a moderate association. More than 1,400 Baptist churches affiliate with the BGAV. History of the BGAV Baptists have been in Virginia since the American Revolution, but had not organized as cooperating churches, preferring the independence common among Baptists. Not until June 3, 1822 was a formal Association formed, and then only ‚ÄúTo propagate the Gospel and advance the Redeemer's Kingdom throughout the State.‚Äù It also emphasized that the work would be done while ‚Äúnot infringing the rights of individuals or churches.‚Äù The BGAV emphasized missions from the beginning. At the first general meeting on June 7, 1823, the Association agreed to fund two church planting missionaries at $30 a month for two years. Technically the BGAV meets once annually, and relies on the Virginia Baptist Mission Board (VBMB) to administer the missions and provide continuing support to participating churches. Relationships with other organizations In Virginia, there are two Southern Baptist Convention-affiliated state organizations, with BGAV being the \\"more moderate\\" of the two. The rival Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia was created when seven hundred churches left the BGAV in September 1996. Since the BGAV does not prevent its member churches from dually aligning with another Baptist group, some of its members may also affiliate with the more conservative SBCV, though the BGAV and SBCV often disagree on priorities. The BGAV joined the Baptist World Alliance in 2004 after the Southern Baptist Convention pulled out of the alliance. At the time, BGAV Executive Director John V. Upton, Jr., said, \\"Virginia Baptists have been a part of the BWA since its beginning in 1905. Our membership up to this point had been through the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). The decision of the SBC to leave the BWA has automatically removed our membership. In this annual meeting Virginia Baptists have overwhelmingly voted to maintain that historic and strategic relationship.\\" The BGAV contributes more to the Baptist World Alliance (BWA) than does any convention or union in the world. In 2006, the BGAV received some Georgia Baptist churches that had requested affiliation. The move is unusual for Southern Baptist churches which almost universally affiliate with conventions in their states or region. But it represents a growing interest in denominational links by affinity rather than geography, say some observers. Seminary partnerships The BGAV partners to some degree with several seminaries throughout the United States, some of which also partner with the SBC, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, or other groups.

Tetra Press. Belgium pg 12-14. Aquarium filters remove physical and soluble chemical waste products from aquaria, simplifying maintenance. Furthermore, aquarium filters are necessary to support life as aquaria are relatively small, closed volumes of water compared to the natural environment of most fish.Sands D (1994) A fishkeepers guide to Central American cichlids. Tetra Press. Belgium pg 17-19. Overview Animals, typically fish, kept in fish tanks produce waste from excrement and respiration. Another source of waste is uneaten food or plants and fish which have died. These waste products collect in the tanks and contaminate the water. As the degree of contamination rises, the risk to the health of the aquaria increases and removal of the contamination becomes critical. Filtration is a common method used for maintenance of healthy aquaria. =Biological filtration and the nitrogen cycle= A large shower biological filter designed to maximize the beneficial effects of the nitrogen cycle, in a koi pond Proper management of the nitrogen cycle is a vital element of a successful aquarium. Excretia and other decomposing organic matter produce ammonia which is highly toxic to fish. Bacterial processes oxidize this ammonia into the slightly less toxic nitrites, and these are in turn oxidized to form the much less toxic nitrates. In the natural environment these nitrates are subsequently taken up by plants as fertilizer and this does indeed happen to some extent in an aquarium planted with real plants. An aquarium is, however, an imperfect microcosm of the natural world. Aquariums are usually much more densely stocked with fish than the natural environment. This increases the amount of ammonia produced in the relatively small volume of the aquarium. The bacteria responsible for breaking down the ammonia by converting it to nitrite, Nitrosomonas, colonize the surface of any objects inside the aquarium. The bacteria that then convert nitrite to nitrate are Nitrospira and Nitrobacter.https://petfishplace.com/types-aquarium-filtration In most cases, a biological filter is nothing more than a chemically inert porous sponge, which provides a greatly enlarged surface area on which these bacteria can develop. These bacterial colonies take several weeks to form, during which time the aquarium is vulnerable to a condition commonly known as \\"new tank syndrome\\" if stocked with fish too quickly. Some systems incorporate bacteria capable of converting nitrates into nitrogen gas.http://www.aquariumslife.com/diy-projects/diy-aquariumdenitrator Accumulation of toxic ammonia from decomposing wastes is the largest cause of fish mortality in new, poorly maintained, or overloaded aquariums. In the artificial environment of the aquarium, the nitrogen cycle effectively ends with the production of nitrates. In order that the nitrate level does not build up to a harmful level regular partial water changes are required to remove the nitrates and introduce new, uncontaminated water.http://www.aquacadabra.com/blog/the-basics-of-filtration =Mechanical and chemical filtration= The process of mechanical filtration removes particulate material from the water column. This particulate matter may include uneaten food, feces or plant or algal debris. Mechanical filtration is typically achieved by passing water through materials which act as a sieve, physically trapping the particulate matter. Removal of solid waste can be as simple as physical hand netting of debris, and/or involve highly complex equipment. All removal of solid wastes involve filtering water through some form of mesh in a process known as mechanical filtration. The solid wastes are first collected, and then must be physically removed from the aquarium system. Mechanical filtration is ultimately ineffective if the solid wastes are not removed from the filter, and are allowed to decay and dissolve in the water. Dissolved wastes are more difficult to remove from the water. Several techniques, collectively known as chemical filtration, are used for the removal of dissolved wastes, the most popular being the use of activated carbon and foam fractionation. To a certain extent, healthy plants extract dissolved chemical wastes from water when they grow, so plants can serve a role in the containment of dissolved wastes. A final and less common situation requiring filtration involves the desire to sterilize water-borne pathogens. This sterilization is accomplished by passing aquarium water through filtration devices which expose the water to high intensity ultraviolet light and/or exposing the water to dissolved ozone gas. Materials suitable for aquarium filtration Sponges, plastic balls, ceramic tubes and gravel are all suitable for aquarium filtration Numerous materials are suitable as aquarium filtration media. These include synthetic wools, known in the aquarium hobby as filter wool, made of polyethylene terephthalate or nylon. Synthetic sponges or foams, various ceramic and sintered glass and silicon products along with igneous gravels are also used as mechanical filter materials. Materials with a greater surface area provide both mechanical and biological filtration. Some filter materials, such as plastic \\"bioballs\\", are best used for biological filtration. With the notable exception of diatom filters, aquarium filters are rarely purely mechanical in action, as bacteria will colonise most filter materials effecting some degree of biological filtration. Activated carbon and zeolites are also frequently added to aquarium filters. These highly porous materials act as adsorbates binding various chemicals to their large external surfaces and also as sites of bacterial colonisation. The simplest type of aquarium filter consists only of filter wool and activated carbon. The filter wool traps large debris and particles, and the activated carbon adsorbs smaller impurities. These should be changed regularly at suitable intervals. This is particularly important in the case of activated carbon filters, which may re-release their adsorbed contents in large (and therefore harmful) doses if they are allowed to saturate. Activated carbon adsorbs toxins on the extended porous surface of the carbon. It cannot be reactivated by boiling in water. The adsorption of activated carbon can be restored by thermal regeneration at temperatures of 500‚Äì900 ¬∞C (932‚Äì1,652 ¬∞F), electrochemical regeneration, ultrasound, or other industrial processes. For the aquarist, replacing the activated carbon with fresh material is simple and inexpensive. Types A commercially available canister filter Numerous types of aquarium filters are commercially available, including: =Power filters= Power or HOB (hang on back) filters, which are impeller powered, remove water from the aquarium, usually with a long siphoning tube, which is then pushed (or pulled) through a series of different filter media and returned to the aquarium. These are the most common type of aquarium filter. They are usually more effective and easier to maintain than internal filters. Advantages of this type of filter are that they allow for a selection of different types of filter media depending on the tank needs, and that they are easy to clean without disturbing the inhabitants of the tank because they sit on the outside of the fish tank. Disadvantages of power filters include their smaller capacity for filter media compared to canister filters, and that they tend to be very noisy, usually resulting from vibrations. Canister filters Compared to filters that hang on the back of the aquarium, canister-style external filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks). Benefits of this type of filter are that they can provide a high volume of filter material without reducing the internal space in the aquarium, and that they can be disconnected from the tank for cleaning/maintenance and replaced without disturbing the aquarium interior or occupants. Also, as a filter with external plumbing, it supports in-line installation of other aquarium equipment, such as water heaters and carbon dioxide diffusers. Such equipment can be removed from the tank and installed in-line into the return pipe of the filter. Disadvantages of canister filters include the increased cost and complexity relative to internal filters and difficulties in cleaning the tubes which transfer water to and from the aquarium. There is also the risk of a leak, which naturally is an issue for any filter placed outside of the aquarium. Canister filters were initially designed to filter drinking water, under low pressure. Canister filters for aquariums use high water pressure, from a properly powered pump, to force water through the dense filter media. A pump can draw water from an under-gravel filter, and run it into a canister for double filtration. Diatom filters Diatom filters are used only for sporadic cleaning of tanks, they are not continuously operated on aquariums. These filters utilise diatomaceous earth to create an extremely fine filter down to 1 ¬µm which removes particulate matter from the water column. Trickle filters Trickle filters, also known as wet/dry filters are another water filtration systems for marine and freshwater aquariums. This filter comes in two configurations, one which is placed on top of the aquarium (more rarely seen) and one which is placed below the aquarium (more common). If the wet/dry filter is placed on top of the aquarium, water is pumped over a number of perforated trays containing filter wool or some other filter material. The water trickles through the trays, keeping the filter wool wet but not completely submerged, allowing aerobic bacteria to grow and aiding biological filtration. The water returns to the aquarium like rain. Alternatively, the wet/dry filter may be placed below the tank. In this design, water is fed by gravity to the filter below the aquarium. Prefiltered water is delivered to a perforated plate (drip plate). Prefiltering may take place in the aquarium via a foam block or sleeve in the overflow, or weir siphon, or it may be prefiltered by filter wool resting on the perforated plate. The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over the drip plate, and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or \\"Double Layer Spiral\\") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO2 is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump. Algae filters Algae scrubber (upflow version) floating on a reef pond Algae may be grown purposely, which removes chemicals from the water which need to be removed in order to have healthy fish, invertebrates and corals. This is a natural (\\"green\\") filtering method, which lets an aquarium operate the way oceans and lakes operate.Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2 Algae and disease-causing organisms can also be removed by treating the water with ultraviolet irradiation, but the drawback of UV is that it will kill beneficial bacteria as well. Therefore, UV treatment is typically used only when needed, and not all the time. Baffle filters A newly set up baffle filter, under a large volume cichlid aquarium Baffle filters are similar to wet and dry, trickle filters in that they are generally situated below the aquarium. This type of filter consists of a series of baffles that the water must pass through in order to reach the pump which is returning water to the aquarium. These baffles then act much like a series of canister filters and can be filled with different filter media for different purposes.Sandford G, Crow R (1991) The Manual of Tank Busters. Tetra Press, USA Fluidized bed filter Simple DIY fluidized sand bed filter The fluidized bed filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. The principle is to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below so that the sand becomes fluidized ‚Äì behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in liquefaction, quick sand, and industrial processes including municipal sewage treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, and so there is a large surface for aerobic denitrification bacteria. Therefore, the size of the filter can be modest. The filter itself can be internal or external. In its simplest DIY internal version an FBF is very easy to build, with a container, sand, pump, and some plumbing. There are many variables: shape and size of the container, quantity of sand or equivalent, particle sizes, the pump's power, and plumbing. =Internal filters= An internal aquarium filter driven by air displacement Internal filters are, by definition, filters within the confines of the aquarium. These include the sponge filter, variations on the corner filter (pictured top right and left), foam cartridge filter and the undergravel filter. An internal filter may have an electric pump and thus be an internal power filter, often attached to the inside of aquaria via suction cups. Airlift filters Sponge filters and corner filters (sometimes called box filters) work by essentially the same mechanism as an internal filter. Both generally work by airlift, using bubbles from an air pump rising in a tube to create flow. In a sponge filter, the inlet may only be covered by a simple open-cell block of foam. A corner filter is slightly more complex. These filters are often placed in the corner on the bottom of the aquarium. Water enters slits in the box, passes through a layer of medium, then exits through the airlift tube to return to the aquarium. These filters tend to only be suitable for small and lightly stocked aquaria. The sponge filter is especially useful for rearing fry where the sponge prevents the small fish from entering the filter. Undergravel filters A schematic diagram of an undergravel filter run by both an air displacement and water pump (powerhead) One of the oldest types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel on the base of the aquarium and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via air displacement. Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel filter plate (also called the plenum). Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material. Greater flow rate of water through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than air displacement. Beneficial bacteria colonize the gravel bed and provide biological filtration, using the substrate of the aquarium itself as a biological filter. Undergravel filters can be detrimental to the health of aquatic plants. Fine substrates such as sand or peat may clog an undergravel filter. Undergravel filters are not effective if the substrate bed is uneven. In an uneven gravel bed, water will flow only through the thin portions of the bed, leaving the more heavily covered areas to become anoxic. =Marine-specific systems=Protein skimmersDeep sand bedsBerlin methodReferences Category:Fishkeeping Category:Aquariums ","title":"Aquarium filter"},{"id":"10399686","title":"Princess Eleonore of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich"},{"id":"10399701","title":"Current Issues and Events (UIL)"},{"id":"10399716","text":"Senegalia tenuifolia is a perennial climbing shrub which is native to Asia, the Caribbean, India and South America.

Born around 800, Louis was the illegitimate son of Rotrude, daughter of Charlemagne, by Count Rorgon I of Maine. He was probably raised at the court of his grandfather, Charlemagne, until the latter's death in 814. From 835, he served his uncle, the Emperor Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's successor, as archchancellor. On Louis's death in June 840, he declared his allegiance to Charles the Bald and became his archchancellor. In September or October 840, Abbot Hilduin of Saint-Denis defected from Charles to Lothair I. Charles promised Louis, already a monk of Saint-Denis, that when the abbacy was back in his control he would bestow it on Louis. On 14 June 844, Richbod and Nithard, abbot and lay abbot respectively of Saint-Riquier, died in battle. Charles appointed Louis abbot of Saint-Riquier with Charles's uncle Rudolf as his lay counterpart. In 857, some Vikings from Jeufosse raided Saint-Denis and captured Louis. His half-brother, Gauzlin, the bishop of Paris, was also captured. Charles had to raise a large ransom, including a contribution of 688 lb of gold and 3250 lb of silver from Saint-Denis, to liberate the captives. Louis held the position of archchancellor until his death. He died in 867. On his death Charles named himself lay abbot and took direct control of the abbey.

A railway line connects with Prestea to Tarkwa and beyond to the coastal city of Sekondi-Takoradi. History of Prestea Since 1873 there has been mining of gold deposits in Prestea, and in 1965, independent gold mining companies based in Prestea were merged at the time by the government. The World Bank granted a loan in 1985 to finance the gold mining in Prestea, but after three years of continuous losses by the merged gold company, the mines that were privatized from 1994 to 1999 had their mineral rights sold to the Canadian company of Golden Star Resources. The mining of gold caused environmental problems, such as the storage of overburden in the vicinity of the hospital, contamination of the river with toxic waste, as happened in October 2004. Due to the vibrations caused by the explosions, damage was caused to the buildings of the town. The gold mines are a tourist attraction, partly due to the smelter where the gold is melted down into ingots and two tennis courts and an 18-hole golf course. Economy The Prestea community has suffered from the detrimental effects of over a century of mining activities, as of 2011 this town still boast of only one senior high school in the area although overwhelming amount of riches is being gained from their soils. Education The higher education institution is the Prestea Senior High Technical School. There is also the Prestea Goldfields International School. Due to the presence of gold in abundance in Prestea, the kids don't like pursuing education but rather they like to chase money by indulging in small scale mining practices.

It was coined in 1995 by Robert N. Proctor, a Stanford University professor, and linguist Iain Boal.interview with Robert Proctor \\"So I asked a linguist colleague of mine, Iain Boal, if he could coin a term that would designate the production of ignorance and the study of ignorance, and we came up with a number of different possibilities.\\" The word is based on the Neoclassical Greek word , agn≈çsis, \\"not knowing\\" (cf. Attic Greek ·ºÑŒ≥ŒΩœâœÑŒøœÇ \\"unknown\\"See: Wiktionary entry on ·ºÑŒ≥ŒΩœâœÑŒøœÇ.), and , -logia. Proctor cites as a prime example the tobacco industry's advertising campaign to manufacture doubt about the cancerous and other health effects of tobacco use. More generally, the term also highlights the condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before. David Dunning of Cornell University warns that \\"the internet is helping propagate ignorance,... which makes [users] prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance\\". Irvin C. Schick refers to unknowledge \\"to distinguish it from ignorance. He uses the example of \\"terra incognita\\" in early maps, noting that \\"The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the production of unknowledge, the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism\\". Active causes of culturally induced ignorance can include the influence of the media, corporations, and governmental agencies, through secrecy and suppression of information, document destruction, and selective memory. Another example is climate denial, where oil companies paid teams of scientists to downplay the effects of climate change. Passive causes include structural information bubbles, including those created by segregation along racial and class lines, that create differential access to information. Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do not \\"come to be\\", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about plate tectonics was censored and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained classified military information related to undersea warfare. History=Origins= The term \\"agnotology\\" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer: \\"Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked ‚Äì or even, as Johannes Kepler once put it, as the mother who must die for science to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies\\". Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research \\"only half jokingly\\", as \\"agnotology\\" in a 2001 interview about his lapidary work with the colorful rock agate. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of geologic knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by Theophrastus in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as diamonds, asbestos, granite, and coal, all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a \\"victim of scientific disinterest\\", the same \\"structured apathy\\" he called \\"the social construction of ignorance\\". He was later quoted as calling it \\"agnotology, the study of ignorance\\", in a 2003 The New York Times story on medical historians testifying as expert witnesses. Proctor co- organized a pair of events with Londa Schiebinger, his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the Pennsylvania State University in 2003 titled \\"Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance\\", and later a conference at Stanford University in 2005 titled \\"Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance\\". =Political economy= In 2004, Londa Schiebinger gave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th- century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with epistemology, the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: \\"Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle\\". Its use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by Michael Betancourt in a 2010 article titled \\"Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism\\" and expanded in the book The Critique of Digital Capitalism. His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed \\"agnotologic capitalism\\" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a \\"bubble economy\\". Betancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of affective labor. He states that > The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential \\"fact\\" is always > already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value > renders engagement with the conditions of reality ‚Äì the very situations > affective labor seeks to assuage ‚Äì contentious and a source of confusion, > reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the > imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of > distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls \\"life to enjoy\\", can only be > maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If > affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate > the potential for dissent. In his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo. Agnoiology A similar word from the same Greek roots, agnoiology, meaning \\"the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions\\" or \\"the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant\\" describes a branch of philosophy studied by James Frederick Ferrier in the 19th century.  Ainigmology  Anthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion. A more accurate term for such writing would be \\"ainigmology\\", from the root ainigma (as in \\"enigma\\"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering. In Bioinsecurity and Human Vulnerability, ed Nancy Chen and Lesley Sharp, pp. 71-86. Santa Fe: SAR Press.  Media influence  The availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs. and to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects value formation and intelligence. An emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is cognitronics: ;cognitronics : aims (a) at explicating the distortions in the perception of the world caused by the information society and globalization and (b) at coping with these distortions in different fields. Cognitronics is studying and looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of processing information and developing emotional sphere of the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic information processing skills of the learners, linguistic mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad mental outlook being important preconditions of successful work practically in every sphere of professional activity in information society. The field of cognitronics appears to be growing as international conferences have centered on the topic. The 2013 conference was held in Slovenia.

They are frequently visible at sporting events, parades, political rallies, demonstrations, and outdoor festivals. Event organizers, venue managers, and security personnel use barricades as part of their crowd management planning. Crowd control barriers act as a physical and psychological barrier, used to demarcate \\"no access\\" zones, and to designate space for lines. They are also used by riot police to control large gatherings. Crowd control barricades are most commonly made of steel, although lighter-weight plastic variations are sometimes used. Barriers are most effective when they interlock, being attached to each other in a line via hooks at the side of each barricade. When barricades are interlocked, security personnel can create impenetrable lines, because such lines of barriers cannot easily be toppled over. History=Nadar= Brussels mayor Jules Anspach has been credited with the invention of the crowd control barrier for the occasion of the visit of the French photographer Nadar to Brussels. On his visit to Brussels with the balloon G√©ant, on September 26, 1864, Anspach erected mobile barriers to keep the crowd at a safe distance.https://bruges- la-morte.net/wp-content/uploads/Baudelaire_Bruxelles.pdf Up to this day, crowd control barriers are known in both Belgian Dutch and Belgian French as Nadar barriers.Nadarafsluiting at www.cornille-mct.be =Wooden sawhorses= In the mid-to-late 20th century a common version was made of wood in the shape of a sawhorse. The legs are similar but rather heavy duty facsimiles of the hobby sawhorse-version, and about the same height. The horizontal bar consists of a heavy duty plank about 4.2 metres (14 ft) long with printed on it in large letters: Police Line - Do Not Cross. Beginning in the 1980s, steel barriers gradually took the place of wooden sawhorses at many events, including major holiday parades in New York City. =Interlocking steel barriers= Interlocking steel barriers were patented in France in 1951. The original \\"Samia\\" barrier was developed to meet the need to maintain safety and order during France's social upheaval of the 1950s. This type of barricade soon became adopted for crowd control in other European countries, and eventually, the United States. Samia eventually went out of business, but many variations on its original barrier evolved over the years. Barriers became an increasingly common sight, and without much fanfare, blended into the popular culture. Americans soon became accustomed to barriers being part of the background at important events. One of the earliest and most famous examples was the use of barriers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to control the hysterical crowds which greeted The Beatles' arrival in the U.S. in 1964. Steel crowd control barricades have been a common sight at the Olympic Games since the 1980s. Characteristics Numerous suppliers and fabricators have created crowd control barricades, but over the years, some unofficial standards have been generally accepted. These characteristics have been inherent in the barricades offered by the leading suppliers since the 1990s. The international standard barrier lengths are 1-metre, 2-metre, and 2.5-metre. The standard height (for optimum safety and visibility) of a barrier is 43 inches (approximately 109 cm). An 8-foot barricade weighs approximately 55 pounds (25 kilograms). To prevent damage, standard barricades are made of 16-gauge steel tubing, measuring 1.5 inches on the outside diameter. Quality barricades are also hot dip galvanized after fabrication, which allows the barriers to be placed and even stored outside without the danger of rusting. Some barricades are manufactured with bases welded to the barrier; others feature bases which are bolted on. The latter are advantageous because they are replaceable (a new base can be inserted; thus damage to a base doesn't render the remainder of the barrier unusable). There are four main styles of replaceable bases: flat bases, bridge bases, U bases, and wheel bases, all of which offer advantages in different circumstances. Crowd control barricades are sometimes placed side by side without being attached, but they are most effective when they are hooked together. Without a solid interlock, barriers can be lifted out of place by individuals in a crowd, compromising the integrity of a line. The most popular hook style is the \\"classic\\" style in which the male hooks are 15 inches apart. The second most common, the \\"wide hook\\" style, has the male hooks 25 inches apart.

Haro Strait is a critical part of the route of the international boundary between Canada and the United States from the western terminus of the 49th parallel segment of that boundary, and was chosen by the arbitrator in the San Juan Islands dispute (Pig War) over the other main candidate, Rosario Strait, which lies on the east side of the San Juans. Definition According to the USGS, Haro Strait's southern boundary with the Strait of Juan de Fuca is formed by a line between Discovery Island, just east of Victoria, to Cattle Point at the southern tip of San Juan Island. Haro Strait's northern boundary is defined by a line running from the north tip of the Saanich Peninsula through Piers Island, Portland Island, and Moresby Island, then from Point Fairfax on Moresby Island to Turn Point on Stuart Island, then from the southern end of Stuart Island to McCracken Point at the north end of Henry Island, then to Mitchell Bay on San Juan Island. By this definition Haro Strait does not directly join with the Strait of Georgia. The main channel and international boundary runs from Haro Strait north through Boundary Pass to reach the Strait of Georgia. History Haro Strait and other waters flanking the Gulf Islands and San Juans were the home of Straits Salish peoples including the Lummi, Saanich, and Klallam, but the route's natural importance as a regional waterway made it also an important sea-route for raiding and also for regular trade for all marine peoples of the Northwest Coast. Haro Strait was named in 1790 by Manuel Quimper, commander of Princesa Real, in honor of his pilot, Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro. In 1791 Francisco de Eliza sent Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez far into the Strait of Georgia via Haro and Rosario Straits. In 1792 Haro Strait was explored and mapped by George Vancouver. An alternate theory about the naming was proposed by Edmond S. Meany, who suggested that Haro Strait was named for Alonso N√∫√±ez de Haro y Peralta, Archbishop of Mexico from 1772 to 1800, and, for several months during 1787, Viceroy of New Spain. Haro Strait's status as the location of the international boundary was not established until the resolution of the San Juan Islands dispute in 1870, when it was selected by an arbitrator, German Kaiser Wilhelm I, over Rosario Strait, on the eastern side of the San Juans, which was preferred by the British and would have made the San Juans part of British Columbia, as they were originally viewed to be by the British after the Oregon Treaty of 1846. Haro Strait is also an important location for the regional commercial fishery, as the bulk of the Fraser River salmon run uses the Haro Strait to enter that river. D'Arcy Island on the Canadian side of the strait was a leper colony for Chinese immigrants in the 19th century. Navigation Haro Strait is a major shipping channel. Haro Strait, along with Boundary Pass, is the westernmost and most heavily used of the three main channels connecting the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia. Haro Strait joins Boundary Pass at Turn Point on Stuart Island, where a major navigation beacon, Turn Point Light, is located. Heavy, dangerous rip tides occurs near Turn Point, as well as near the northern end of Boundary Pass, between Patos Island Light on Patos Island and East Point on Saturna Island.Strait of Juan De Fuca and Georgia, Washington; Chapter 12 - Coast Pilot 7 - Edition 43, 2011, NOAA Much shorter than the Rosario Strait, though more difficult to navigate and less sheltered, the strait is the main shipping channel to the Port of Vancouver and other ports around the Gulf of Georgia from the open sea. Navigation through American waters in this stretch by Canadian vessels is sanctioned by the Oregon Treaty, which stipulated that commercial shipping south of the 49th Parallel in these waters would be unmolested. Fauna The strait is a favourite locale for whale-watching tours based in Greater Victoria and also in the San Juans because of the density and variety of its marine life, including orcas (killer whales), sea lions, seals and a large range of different species of sea birds.

Named for counties in Georgia and Texas, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. USS LST-822 was laid down by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Company of Evansville, Indiana on 20 September 1944; launched on 1 November 1944; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana on 23 November 1944 with Lieutenant R. N. Mclntyre in command. Service history=World War II, 1944‚Äì1946= After shakedown off the Florida coast, LST-822 departed New Orleans for the Pacific on 27 December. Steaming via San Diego and San Francisco, she reached Pearl Harbor on 6 February 1945. After a month of training in Hawaiian waters, she sailed on 15 March with Army troops and equipment embarked. She touched Eniwetok on 27 March, then arrived Ulithi on 7 April to prepare for participation in the battle of Okinawa, begun a week earlier. Departing 12 April, she approached the shore of Okinawa on 18 April; and, during bitter fighting ashore and frequent Japanese air attacks, she operated between Okinawa and islands to the west. On 22 April she discharged men and equipment at Ie Shima while protected by smoke cover. During her three weeks at Okinawa she survived 18 enemy air raids and carried vitally needed supplies for ground forces. LST-822 departed Okinawa on 11 May, reached Saipan the 18th, and sailed for the Philippines on 6 June. Arriving Leyte on 11 June, she proceeded to Biak where she arrived the 18th and embarked troops for transfer to Okinawa. Steaming via Leyte, she reached Naha, Okinawa, on 4 July. There she embarked troops of the 108th Armored Tank Battalion and sailed on 6 July for Cebu, Philippines. She arrived on 17 July, embarked troop replacements at Subic Bay, then returned to the Ryukyus, arriving Ie Shima on 7 August. Following the surrender of Japan, she returned to the Philippines to transport occupation troops and equipment to Japan. As part of a 120-ship convoy, she departed Lingayen Gulf on 17 September and arrived off Wakayama, Japan, on the 25th. After unloading equipment and debarking Army engineers, she sailed on 1 October for Manila. Between 19 and 27 October, she carried additional occupation troops from Lingayen Gulf to Wakayama; and during the next four months, she supported occupation landings and Allied operations along the coast of Japan. Departing Sasebo on 3 March 1946, LST-822 sailed for the United States where she arrived San Diego on 30 March. After operating along the West Coast from Southern California to Washington, she entered drydock at Portland, Oregon on 28 May. She decommissioned on 27 July and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 10 August. =Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953= LST-822 recommissioned at Bremerton, Washington on 23 November 1950 with Lieutenant Kent D. Myers in command. In response to the invasion of South Korea, she departed Long Beach, California on 10 February 1951 for the Far East. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she arrived Yokosuka, Japan on 23 March. During the next four months she operated between Japan and the western coast of Korea, supporting amphibious operations and bolstering American military operations. She departed Yokosuka on 20 July, arrived San Diego on 9 August, and spent the next nine months participating in amphibious training along the West Coast. LST-822 departed San Diego on 9 April 1952 and again deployed to the Far East, arriving Yokosuka via Pearl Harbor on 18 May. Operating out of Yokosuka and Sasebo, she steamed to ports along the coast of Korea from Inchon and Koje Do to Pusan and Pohang. She transferred men and supplies between Japan and South Korea and later in the year and into 1953 shuttled North Korean prisoners of war during prisoner exchanges. Departing Inchon on 22 January 1953, she sailed via Sasebo to Yokosuka, then departed for the West Coast on 5 February. She arrived San Diego on 5 March and resumed amphibious training, which continued during the remainder of the year. =Vietnam, 1954= LST-822 departed San Diego on 25 January 1954 for the Western Pacific. Arriving Yokosuka on 25 February, she resumed supply duty in support of US forces in the Far East, and during the next five months steamed to Korea, Okinawa, and along the coast of Japan. On 11 August she departed Yokosuka for Haiphong, North Vietnam where she arrived on 26 August. There she joined \\"Operation Passage to Freedom\\", which provided citizens of North Vietnam an opportunity to escape the Communist takeover and to emigrate to South Vietnam. She took part in the evacuation of almost 300,000 Vietnamese from North to South. Between 29 August and 2 October she carried refugees, cargo, and military equipment from Haiphong to Nha Trang, South Vietnam. After returning to Japan on 28 October, LST-822 departed Yokosuka on 17 November, touched Pearl Harbor on 5 December, and reached San Diego on 20 December. =Arctic operations, 1955‚Äì1956= DEW Line support operations, 16 September 1955 LST-822 operated along the West Coast until 27 June 1955 when she sailed for operations in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska. Renamed USNS Harris County (T-LST-822) on 1 July, she steamed via Seattle, Washington and reached Point Hope, Alaska on 27 July. For almost two months she conducted supply and survey operations in the ice-filled Arctic Ocean north of Alaska. Departing Point Hope on 19 September, she sailed to San Diego and arrived on 8 October. She returned to Seattle late in October and from 1 December to 20 January 1956 underwent extensive overhaul. Departing Seattle on 27 January, she carried cargo to San Francisco on 31 January. Harris County was placed in service in reserve on 21 February at Mare Island, California and she entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. In March she transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). =Pacific Ocean operations, 1955‚Äì1976= Manned by a civilian crew, Harris County continued operating along the coast of Alaska and into the southern reaches of the Arctic Ocean. She operated out of ports in California and Washington as a supply and replenishment ship between 1956 and 1962. On 14 January 1962 she departed Seattle for the mid-Pacific. Steaming via Seward, Alaska she arrived Pearl Harbor on 12 February to begin duty as a survey support ship. Thereafter Harris County operated throughout the Pacific from Hawaii to New Guinea while carrying supplies and supporting ocean survey projects. Her duties carried her to eastern New Guinea, the Marshalls, the Marianas, and the Line Islands of Polynesia. Subsequently, placed out of service and struck from the Naval Vessel Register, the ship was sold to the Philippines on 13 September 1976. =As Philippine Navy ship Aurora= The ship was sold to the Philippines on 13 September 1976, and was renamed RPS Aurora (LT-508), and on July 1980 as BRP Aurora (LT-508).

Plymouth Bay retains historical significance for the landing at Plymouth Rock in 1620 by the Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower who proceeded to establish the first permanent Northern European settlement in North America at Plymouth Colony. Plymouth Beach in the foreground and Clarks Island, Saquish Neck, Gurent Point, and the Duxbury Pier Lighthouse visible in the distance Geography Plymouth Bay is an offshoot of the larger Cape Cod Bay and is sometimes considered part of Massachusetts Bay, which is defined by Cape Ann to the north and Cape Cod to the south. Plymouth Bay is also in the southern waters of the Gulf of Maine in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The waters of Plymouth Bay are claimed by three Massachusetts towns, Plymouth in the southern part of the bay, Duxbury in the northern part and Kingston in the westernmost extent of the bay. Plymouth Bay is dominated by geographical features such as Plymouth Beach, a three-mile barrier beach that protects Plymouth Harbor from the rougher seas of Cape Cod Bay. To the north, Saquish Neck serves as another barrier beach protecting the bay and is almost seven miles in length. Plymouth Beach and Saquish Neck together form a mile wide opening, connecting the bay to the open sea, with boating channels deep enough to sustain moderate boating traffic. Within Plymouth Bay itself there are considered two smaller bays, Kingston Bay and Duxbury Bay, both in the northern waters of Plymouth Bay, and Warren Cove, in the southern waters of Plymouth Bay, located between Plymouth Beach and Rocky Point. Several peninsulas define the shoreline of Plymouth Bay such as Rocky Nook, a densely populated coastal area of Kingston, and Powder Point of Duxbury. Plymouth Bay contains one island with year-round inhabitants, Clarks Island, in the northern portion of the bay and is administered by Plymouth. Plymouth Bay also acts as the mouth for several important rivers in the region such as the Jones River in Kingston and the Eel River in Plymouth. Although used for boating, Plymouth Bay itself is relatively shallow. Depths in the bay will range from 35 feet, in the deepest channels west of Fort Standish, to 6 to 42 inches throughout much of the bay's rolling mud flats. Most of Plymouth Bay's mud flats can be found in Kingston Bay and Duxbury Bay, which are prone to becoming totally exposed in times of low tide. The largest of these such flats is Ichabod's Flat in Kingston Bay. The mud flats of Kingston Bay are used for shellfishing and clamming and have flourished due to Plymouth Bay's ability to isolate itself from red tide, which occasionally impacts the Massachusetts coastline.

He earned a BA in English Language and Literature from Victoria College at the University of Toronto in 1957, and began a teaching career in 1961 at the high school in Port Perry, Ontario. He later went on to teach in Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes, in addition to stints at the Ontario Ministry of Education, before retiring in 1994. He married Gwendolyn Parrott in 1957; they had four children. Drew began to write seriously in high school and published a number of short stories (to magazines such as The Tamarack Review) and non-fiction pieces throughout his career, while also selling radio and film scripts. His first novel (and sometimes stated to be his best) was The Wabeno Feast (1973). While rooted in Northern Ontario, the story indicted modern industrial civilization as an extension of the European colonization of Canada by depicting an entire society's fall into ruin. In her essay on \\"Canadian Monsters: Some Aspects of the Supernatural in Canadian Fiction\\", Margaret Atwood noted that Drew's use of the aboriginal wabeno revealed a concern \\"with man's relationship to his society and to himself, as opposed to his relationship with the natural environment\\" and she concluded that Drew's novel combined \\"both concerns in a rather allegorical and very contemporary fashion\\". Many readers, though, surely know him better as the author of an ecological science fiction trilogy, the Erthring Cycle (1984-1986), and of several movie novelizations (Corvette Summer, Dragonslayer, *batteries not included, and Willow, the last three of which were translated into French and the second in German). His non-fiction also reflected his concern for the environment and interest for Canadian landscapes, as seen in books such as Superior: The Haunted Shore and A Sea Within: the Gulf of St. Lawrence. His ultimate novel, Halfway Man (1989), expanded on themes from his first.

There is debate as to whether he was ever count of Maine or whether he merely made a claim to it. Elias was born no earlier than May 1114.Kathryn Ann Dutton (2011), Geoffrey, Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy, 1129‚Äì51, PhD thesis (University of Glasgow), 90 n. 493. By 1129, Elias had married Philippa, daughter of Count Rotrou III of Perche.Dutton, 27 n. 122. It is possible but unlikely that Elias' father left him the county of Maine; his elder brother, Geoffrey Plantagenet was ruler of Anjou, Maine and the Touraine. Elias rebelled in 1145 with the support of Lord Robert III of Sabl√©, sparking a conflict known in Angevin historiography as the \\"war of the barons\\" (guerra baronum). This war may have dragged on into 1146, but in the end Elias was captured and imprisoned by his brother. According to the Gesta consulum Andegavorum, Elias, acting \\"by the counsel of wicked men ... attacked his own brother, demanding the consulship of Maine\\". A 13th-century source, the Chronicon Turonense magnum, likewise call Elias the count of Maine. All chronicles agree that Elias was imprisoned in Tours and died as a result.Dutton, 108‚Äì9. John of Marmoutier, writing in the 1170s, states that Geoffrey released Elias, but that he died from a fever contracted during his incarceration a few days later.John of Marmoutier, Historia Gaufredi ducis Normannorum et comitis Andegavorum, in Chroniques des comtes d'Anjou et des seigneurs d'Amboise, ed. L. Halphen & R. Poupardin (Paris, 1913), pp. 170‚Äì231: 207. The annals of the priory of L'√âvi√®re place his death in 1151, and the necrology of the priory of Fontaines gives the date as 15 January.

Tombazis by Peter von Hess Iakovos \\"Yiakoumakis\\" Tombazis (, c. 1782-1829) was a merchant and ship-owner from the Greek island of Hydra who became the first Admiral of the Greek Navy during the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire (1821-1829). Tombazis' date of birth is not known but some historians suggest 1782. He was the son of Nikolaos Tombazis and brother of Emmanouil Tombazis. As a businessman, he was shrewd and was the first to build greenhouses in Greece. In 1818, he was initiated into the Filiki Eteria (Friendly Society) which was preparing the ground for the revolt. When the war broke out, his fellow islanders made Tombazis admiral of the fleet of Hydra. He took part in several clashes against the Sultan's Navy in the eastern Aegean and soon realized that the Greek warships, being mostly converted and armed merchantmen, could not face the Ottoman ships of the line in conventional combat. He therefore proposed the use of fireships instead, and sent Dimitrios Papanikolis to burn the Turkish frigate Moving Mountain anchored at Eresos on Lesbos. Tombazis met fellow Hydriote Andreas Miaoulis in 1822 and reportedly realized the man's military genius, proposing him as admiral of the fleet. After Tombazis withdrew from the admiralty, he continued to support the revolution with his ships and money. He died in 1829. The Greek destroyer Tombazis (D-215) was named for the Admiral in 1976.

The slump continued in the 2007‚Äì08 season, after the club lost 1‚Äì4 to Hapoel Arad in the Relegation play-offs and dropped further to the fifth tier at the time, Liga Bet. At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Tzafririm won Liga Bet South B division and returned to Liga Alef. Due to the restructuring of the Israeli football pyramid, Tzafririm jumped by two levels, to the third tier of Israeli football for the 2009‚Äì10 season. After being badly defeated in the very last match of the 2010‚Äì11 season, the club was relegated to Liga Bet, currently the fourth tier of Israeli football.

The school has a population of approximately 1,450 students in 9th‚Äì12th grades. The school's offerings include Advanced Placement classes and the International Baccalaureate degree program. History The High Point City Schools were established in 1897, but there was not a distinct high school until \\"High Point High School\\" was founded in 1926. The current building was erected in 1927, on what was formerly the High Point city fair grounds, and is the oldest high school in Guilford County. It is an example of Gothic architecture, with three floors and four towers. Charles F. Thomlinson was the Chairman of the school board when High Point High School was built. He was the first person to have a vision for what High Point High School should be like. In 1927, T. Wingate Andrews (Superintendent of High Point City Schools) presided over the dedication of the building. In 1968, High Point's William Penn High School closed.William Penn Project  High Point University  High Point, NC. Retrieved Sep 16, 2020. In response to that, a new second high school in High Point, T. Wingate Andrews High School, opened around that same time, ending High Point's era of school segregation. High Point High School was renamed \\"High Point Central High School\\" around 1962, and is so named today. Campus=Building= One of the building's entrances, circa 1960 The current building was completed in 1927 and designed by Greensboro architect Harry Barton, in Collegiate Gothic style. The building was considered the grandest educational building in the state and was modern for its time. The building was decorated in tapestry brick with terracotta architectural ornamentation. The halls on the interior of the building had tile and terrazzo floors, intricate plaster moldings and ceiling medallions with cherubs, fine woodworking and custom cabinetry. The school's main building from above, circa 1962 High Point High School was also outfitted with modern technological innovations for its time including a central vacuum system, and an innovative heating and air conditioning system. The three Gothic entrance towers, each four stories high, held an ice bin. Large fans circulated the cool air from the ice bins throughout the school. The melt water was intended to be used in the several water fountains throughout the campus. =Grounds= The grounds of High Point High School were landscaped by prominent landscape architect Earl S. Draper, who had also designed the High Point suburb of Emerywood. The campus had a network of sidewalks, complemented by oak trees and shrubbery. The campus also had hedges surrounding the eastern and northern boundaries of the campus along Ferndale Boulevard and the sports field. A driveway for cars and buses ran along the front of the school and was cased by a grand gateway built of tapestry brick, and cast stone ornamentation. Sadly, much of the cast stone ornamentation was lost over the years to vandalism. The sports ground originally included a tennis court, baseball field, and a track and field. Over the years, it has grown to include a large gymnasium and an expanded tennis court. =Additions= In 1957, a new gymnasium was built on the sports ground, while a new cafeteria building was built in the rear courtyard of the main building. In 1962, a three story addition was added to the northwestern section of the school. This addition provided numerous classrooms and two modern science laboratories: a chemistry lab and a physics lab. In 1975, new windows were installed to replace the energy inefficient ones. The elegant gothic carved doors and transoms were gradually removed from the buildings main entrance in favor of new metal doors from 1977 to 1981. High Point Central High School was extensively renovated in 2002. A new air conditioning system was installed after several heat waves occurred during the previous years, while the original radiators were scrapped. The ornate plaster ceilings were removed on all floors except for the first floor hall way in front of the theater in favor of cheap, drop-down, foam ceiling tiles. In 2003, a red awning was installed over the entrance of tower four. An aluminum covered walkway was also installed to provide shelter to the elementary students walking from the neighboring Tomlinson Montessori School, to the cafeteria for their lunch. In the late 2000s Tomlinson Montessori vacated their school building and High Point Central moved several classes to the building. The Academy at Central now occupies the Tomlinson Building. In 2010, funds were appropriated for the construction of a new addition and renovations to the 1957 gymnasium. The addition of a new cafeteria was completed in 2017, and a new media center now occupies the old cafeteria building. Academics High Point Central High is home to a strong International Baccalaureate program and Advanced Placement program. These programs offer students vigorous courses and college credit. Honors courses and College preparation courses are also offered as well. High Point Central High School's IB program is the only IB program offered in High Point and was established in 1995. AP courses have been offered at High Point Central since the 1970s.

Synopsis Klaha and Cecil are set to get married. However, their wedding must be postponed because Klaha is summoned from England to Romania on business. Klaha goes to Transylvania, and arrives at the Earl of Dracula's castle, where he is staying. The Earl seems welcoming, but Klaha has strange experiences while staying there. On his arrival, he notices a painting of the Earl's deceased wife, who looks very much like Cecil. 2 nights later, the Earl agrees to buy a house in England. That same night, after having a nightmare, Klaha wakes up to see a coffin leaving the grounds. While looking for the Earl, Klaha sees the painting again, but this time, the word \\"Cecil\\" is written under it. Too late does Klaha realise that the Earl is a vampire. He immediately leaves to try to catch up with him. Meanwhile, back in London, Cecil starts having dreams about the Earl of Dracula. She confesses those dreams to Mana, disguised as a nun, who tells her to pray about it. During Klaha's stay, she, unaware that Klaha is already going back, receives a letter (seemingly in Klaha's hand, but probably written by the Earl) informing her that Klaha must stay an additional night, thus upsetting her. On the night that Klaha is returning, K√∂zi visits Cecil to drink her blood (as he had done with other victims; a move that he regrets). The Earl, however, sees this occur, and sends Mana to stop him. After a confrontation in which she uses roses as knives, K√∂zi demands to know why she is attacking him; Mana tells him that Cecil is \\"the Earl's Virgin Bride.\\" At hearing this, K√∂zi realises that the Earl wants to remain immortal. After a flashback which reveals their pasts (see above), K√∂zi calls Mana a hypocrite, since she sold her soul for revenge. Mana responds, \\"I believe in God so I can keep my self-respect!\\"; hearing this, K√∂zi leaves in anger. Several nights later, the Earl's coffin arrives at the Church. The Earl wakes up, and Mana brings him a girl (not Cecil). He bites the girl's neck, and immediately, he gains his youthful appearance back. He then proceeds to kill the deliverymen who brought him in. The next day, he darkens the day sky and meets Cecil, who he immediately recognises by her respective locket (which has a photo of Klaha); he reappears during that moment to give her locket back to her. That same evening, the Earl finally visits Cecil. After several moments, the Earl bites down her neck. Two nights later, she finally realises that Klaha was on his way back, and attempts suicide, but is saved by the Earl. Klaha finally returns to England. Upon his return, he discovers that Cecil is ill, and her parents don't know what to do. Klaha then sees the two bite marks on Cecil's neck and informs everyone, \\"A vampire did this\\"; he then shows his two bite marks. Klaha realises that he is once again too late to stop the Earl, and says, \\"Now I'll really need help!\\" while a vision of the Earl holding the town in terror appears. The scene shifts back to the beginning of the film proper: Klaha, Cecil's father, a priest, and a doctor attempt to exorcise Cecil in an attempt to lure out the Earl. Suddenly, the Earl of Dracula appears. Klaha attempts to shoot the Earl through the neck, but he immediately recovers. He sets Cecil free. The priest attempts to stop him, but the Earl manages to throw the priest's crucifix on the ground. He then kills the priest by breaking his neck, stabs Cecil's father, and slits the doctor's throat. Klaha makes one last attempt to stop the Earl and Cecil from escaping, but they escape anyway (whereas, in the beginning, which was shown as a dream, he stabs Cecil when she became a human shield). K√∂zi then appears in the room. Klaha is frightened at first, but K√∂zi assures him that he will not harm him, revealing where they are hidden: underneath the church. K√∂zi tells Klaha he must kill Dracula and Mana, the latter because of one reason, as K√∂zi explains: \\"The more an adept believer of God you are, the more horrible the experience will be,\\" reminding Klaha of the death of the priest. Before they leave, K√∂zi reminds Klaha: \\"Don't forget to kill him!\\", which Klaha promises to do. They go to the church, where a ritual is under way to make Cecil the Earl's wife. Klaha appears in an attempt to stop the Earl and Mana. He draws his gun, only to see the Earl attempt to bite his neck to kill him. K√∂zi, however, comes at the nick of time, and he and the Earl start to fight (the reason for the fight was, as explained by K√∂zi, because of territorial issues). During the fight, Mana attempts to escape, but is found out by the Earl, and is used by him as a human shield, protecting him from a blow that was meant for him. The ferocity of the Earl's attacks increase as a result from this. K√∂zi, however, instead of continuing the fight, surprises everyone by stabbing himself in the gut. K√∂zi asks Klaha to kill him, and he does. Klaha then goes to Cecil. At first, she seems to have recovered. However, her eyes turn red and she bares her fangs at him, proving she is still a vampire. Mana tells Klaha to kill Cecil before dying herself, begging him to \\"Please stop [Cecil's] breath.\\" Klaha attempts to do so, only to be prevented by the Earl, who, although injured, is still alive. Cecil drinks his blood again (the first was earlier, during the ritual). While this goes on, Klaha takes advantage and stabs the Earl 2 times with his sword, outraging Cecil. Klaha then turns his sword to Cecil, and he manages to stab her 3 times. Before going for a fourth, he hesitates and lowers his sword. He then does something familiar: he stabs his hand to allow Cecil to drink his blood. The scene ends with Cecil giving a familiar expression, and it's revealed that Klaha was a vampire all along; he was biting her neck (albeit unseen from the position of their faces). In the final scene, Klaha, in his vampire form, wakes up, as if from a nightmare, suggesting that perhaps the whole events which occurred in the film were all inside of Klaha's mind. Cecil (also in her vampire form, but dressed in a white wedding gown and with her hair down) sits up beside him and smiles. The film ends with Klaha walking down the aisle, carrying Cecil in his arms. The final intertitle states their feelings for each other: \\"The only one I want is you.\\" External links * Category:2002 films Category:Japanese silent films Category:Japanese films Category:Vampires in film Category:Malice Mizer ","title":"Bara no Konrei ~Mayonaka ni Kawashita Yakusoku~"},{"id":"10400213","text":"Brian Bainbridge (born Alfred Brian Bainbridge, 15 October 1932, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire) was an English first-class cricketer, who played five games for Yorkshire between 1961 and 1963.

It was formed in July 1943 as part of expansion of the RAAF's fighter force, and was assigned to mobile striking forces for the duration of the war. After completing training, No. 78 Squadron was deployed to the combat zone north of Australia in October 1943. From November that year until September 1944 the squadron supported the advance of the Allied ground forces through western New Britain and the north coast of New Guinea by attacking Japanese positions, providing fighter protection for recently established beachheads, and escorting Australian and United States bombers. From late 1944 until mid-1945 it operated against Japanese positions and shipping in the eastern Netherlands East Indies. The squadron took part in the Borneo campaign during the final weeks of the war. No. 78 Squadron was reduced to a cadre after it returned to Australia in December 1945, but received new aircraft in 1946 and undertook training exercises until being disbanded in April 1948. History=Operations during 1943= During 1943 the RAAF received 399 P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft. Their arrival allowed the service to expand its combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons to join the three squadrons that had operated the type in the South West Pacific area since 1942.Wilson (1988), p. 161 No. 78 Squadron was formed at Camden, New South Wales, on 20 July 1943.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 63 It was the fourth of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established, following No. 84 Squadron in February, No. 86 Squadron in March and No. 82 Squadron in June; the final unit, No. 80 Squadron, was formed in September. No. 78 Squadron began to receive its P-40N Kittyhawk fighters from 2 August 1943, and conducted training with these aircraft until early October. The squadron began moving from Camden to Woodlark Island in the war zone off New Guinea on 12 October 1943. However, its destination was changed to Kiriwina Island, and the squadron became operational there as part of No. 73 Wing on 27 November.Eather (1995), p. 91 This wing was controlled by No. 10 (Operational) Group, a mobile formation established on 13 November to support the planned Allied advance along the north coast of New Guinea.Odgers (1968), pp. 182‚Äì184 During late November and December 1944, No. 78 Squadron participated in attacks against Japanese positions in New Britain alongside No. 76 and No. 77 Squadrons, which were also equipped with Kittyhawks. These operations were undertaken to support the landings conducted by American forces at Arawe on 15 December and Cape Gloucester on the 26th of the month.Odgers (1968), pp. 126‚Äì129 In addition to bombing and strafing Japanese positions, No. 78 Squadron also escorted RAAF and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers on several occasions.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 63‚Äì64 =Operations during 1944= No. 78 Squadron moved to Nadzab on the mainland of New Guinea in January 1944. This redeployment was completed on the 12th of the month, and the squadron began operations as part of No. 78 Wing the next day. Many of the ground attack and escort sorties undertaken by No. 78 Squadron during January supported the Australian Army forces engaged in the Finisterre Range campaign.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 64 The squadron was mainly used to escort Australian and USAAF bomber and transport aircraft in February and early March, but it also conducted a small number of ground attack sorties. These escort duties were unpopular among No. 78 Wing's fighter pilots, who believed that the American officers in charge of the air effort in New Guinea were assigning Australian units to unimportant tasks. In reality, all Allied fighter units recently arrived in New Guinea were initially tasked with escort missions as part of a 'probationary' period.Odgers (1968), p. 190 In March 1944, No. 78 Wing moved to Cape Gloucester in New Britain to replace the USAAF's 8th Fighter Group, which was being transferred to Nadzab.Odgers (1968), p. 198 No. 78 Squadron's advance echelon departed Nadzab on 12 March, and the entire squadron became operational in New Britain late in the month.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 65 During the last week of March, No. 78 Squadron and the other units of No. 78 Wing struck Japanese positions in New Britain and nearby Garove island in co-operation with United States Navy PT boats. On 27 March four No. 78 Squadron Kittyhawks attacked and sank two American patrol boats, killing seven sailors and wounding five more. The inquiry conducted after this incident found that the pilots had not been informed that friendly ships were in the area.Odgers (1968), p. 201 A No. 78 Squadron P-40 being towed by a jeep while at an airfield near Hollandia in July 1944 During April 1944, No. 78 Wing received orders to move again, this time to support Operation Reckless, the American landing at Hollandia in western New Guinea. The main party of the squadron departed Cape Gloucester on 17 April bound for Tadji airstrip on the mainland of New Guinea, and its Kittyhawks arrived there on the 24th of the month. No. 78 Squadron began flying patrols over the American beachhead at Hollandia the next day. The squadron continued to provide air defence for Hollandia and Tadji throughout early May. From 7 to 10 May a detachment of 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron operated from the Hollandia beachhead; owing to food shortages in the area the pilots arrived with rations for four days loaded in their aircraft.Odgers (1968), p. 212 On 15 May the unit moved permanently to an airfield near Hollandia, from which it escorted USAAF bombers and formed part of the force protecting the US Army landings at Wakde on 17 May and Biak on the 27th. Overall, the squadron flew 601 sorties during May.Odgers (1968), p. 227 Its operations over Biak included its only air-to-air combat of the war.Wilson (1988), p. 164 On 3 June, 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron intercepted a group of 12 Nakajima Ki-43 fighters and two Nakajima B5N bombers near Biak. The Australian airmen downed five Ki-43s and two B5Ns for the loss of one Kittyhawk and its pilot.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 65‚Äì66Eather (1995), p. 92 This was the last major air battle fought by the RAAF during the Pacific War. On 10 June, eight No. 78 Squadron Kittyhawks were escorting a convoy when they sighted a Japanese Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter. Two of the Australian aircraft attacked the Ki-61 and shot it down near Japen Island. This was the final aerial victory achieved by the RAAF during the New Guinea campaign.Odgers (1968), p. 226 No. 78 Squadron continued to fly defensive patrols over Hollandia until 20 July, when it was redeployed to Noemfoor island.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 66 This was the squadron's sixth move in nine months, and the intensive effort needed to pack and unpack stores on each occasion caused widespread fatigue among airmen and ground crew.Odgers (1968), p. 239 From 21 July 1944, No. 78 Squadron supported the US military's offensive through western New Guinea. The squadron again operated with US Navy PT boats during strikes on Japanese positions in the Vogelkop Peninsula and shipping in Geelvink Bay during July; these operations were undertaken to support the US Army landing at Sansapor on 30 July.Odgers (1968), pp. 240‚Äì241 Many of No. 78 Wing's pilots completed their nine-month operational tour during July and were replaced by inexperienced pilots.Odgers (1968), p. 240 During the first three weeks of August the squadron flew patrols over the beachhead at Sansapor. The intensive operations over Sansapor were trying, with the official history stating that No. 78 Wing was \\"pushed almost to the limit of its operational capacity\\"; two No. 78 Squadron aircraft were lost during this period.Odgers (1968), p. 242 No. 78 Wing attacked Japanese airfields in the Vogelkop Peninsula throughout September, and No. 78 Squadron flew 363 sorties against these targets.Odgers (1968), p. 250 The squadron also struck airfields on the Bomberai Peninsula as well as Japanese shipping in the easternmost islands of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) during the last months of 1944. These operations were undertaken to support the American landings in the Philippines, which began in October, and often involved lengthy flights.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 66‚Äì67 No. 10 (Operational) Group was redesignated the First Tactical Air Force on 25 October; at this time No. 78 Squadron remained part of No. 78 Wing alongside No. 75 and No. 80 Squadrons.Odgers (1968), pp. 298‚Äì299 No. 78 Squadron aircraft began staging through airfields on Morotai from early December, and moved to the island between 21 December and January 1945.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 67 During November, Len Waters, the only known Aboriginal Australian fighter pilot of World War II, was posted to No. 78 Squadron. He remained with the unit until the end of the war and completed 95 combat sorties. =Operations from 1945 to 1948= upright No. 78 Squadron continued to attack Japanese positions in the eastern NEI from Morotai in early 1945. The squadron flew 267 sorties in January during which its aircraft fired 77,000 rounds of machine- gun ammunition and dropped of bombs. Fewer sorties were flown during February and March, and on 10 April No. 78 Squadron ceased operations from Morotai to prepare to take part in the invasion of Tarakan, an island off the east coast of Borneo. While No. 81 Wing had originally been intended to land at Tarakan, due to delays in moving the unit from Australia No. 78 Wing was substituted shortly before the assault convoys departed Morotai. As a result, the wing had only ten days to pack its stores and prepare for its role in the landing.Odgers (1968), p. 453 The main echelon of No. 78 Squadron disembarked at Tarakan on 6 May, but it took much longer than had been anticipated to repair the island's airfield and the unit was unable to recommence flying operations until 18 July. During this period the squadron's ground crew worked with Australian Army engineers to build roads, and some personnel spent time on the front line. From 20 July 1945 until the end of the war, No. 78 Squadron operated over Borneo to support the invasion of Balikpapan.Odgers (1968), p. 483 Its first strike from Tarakan was flown against Japanese positions in the Sandakan area, and on 24 July aircraft from No. 75, No. 78 and No. 80 Squadrons attacked airfields near Banjarmasin. The squadron conducted its final combat operation on 9 August, and was still based at Tarakan at the time the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on the 15th of the month. No. 78 Squadron had suffered 12 fatalities during the war. Following the armistice the squadron undertook leaflet dropping and reconnaissance sorties until November, when the Kittyhawks were flown to Australia. The remainder of the unit's personnel arrived at Sydney on 12 December 1945 on board the British aircraft carrier . After returning to Australia, No. 78 Squadron moved to Deniliquin in New South Wales on 17 December and most of its personnel were sent on leave until 16 January. The squadron was rapidly reduced to a cadre, and comprised only 17 personnel in July 1946.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 68 The unit was located at RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney from May to August 1946, and then moved to RAAF Station Williamtown outside of Newcastle. On 4 August 1946 it received four P-51D Mustang fighters and a single CAC Wirraway trainer. No. 78 Squadron undertook training during 1947, including exercises with Australian and British warships in March and July. During April 1947 two of the squadron's Mustangs took part in a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation cloud seeding experiment; in this role the aircraft sprayed silver iodide onto clouds from tanks beneath their wings with the goal of generating rain.Wilson (1988), p. 116 No. 78 Squadron was disbanded on 1 April 1948.

At the time there were strong allegations that convicts being carried on board murdered the other passengers and crew and headed for San Francisco, but all contemporary evidence supports the assertion that she sank off the far north-western tip of Tasmania. Transferring convicts South Australia prided itself as a colony not founded by convict transportation, and felons who found their way there from the convict colonies were deported to Van Diemen's Land, secured below decks on commercial sailing vessels. Lady Denison was fulfilling such a contract when she sailed from Port Adelaide for Hobart on 17 April 1850 under Captain Edwin Hammond with a crew of 12, 16 paying passengers, 11 convicts, and three prison guards: mounted constable Hill and metropolitan policemen Ward and Freebody. She failed to arrive and dark rumours of her fate spread rapidly. Several months later a large quantity of wreckage positively identified as coming from the vessel was found on the Tasmanian coast south of Cape Grim. The anti-transportation press asserted that the convicts had thrown the articles overboard to hide their crime. During the Australian gold rush there were reports that John Byett alias James Coyle, one of the convicts by the ship had been seen in Victoria and rumors that another had sent letters to Australia from California. Analysis The alleged mutiny and massacre on Lady Denison was part of the Australasian Anti-Transportation League's campaign against the transportation of convicts to Van Diemen's Land, which it largely carried out by means of public rallies and press reports in papers owned by its supporters, all aiming at vilifying the convict population. Similar baseless allegations were made four years later after the ship Madagascar went missing between Melbourne and London. Weather conditions at the time Lady Denison approached the Tasmanian coastline were extreme, two other vessels being lost in Bass Strait around the time. There is circumstantial evidence that wreckage including bodies were found by sealers in the vicinity of Arthur River, Tasmania, the bodies plundered of valuables and disposed of, and the circumstances not reported so their thefts were hidden. In addition, one or more convicts may have managed to struggle ashore alive. James Coyle, in particular, had himself been a convict escapee from Van Diemen's Land, had worked in the Circular Head area, and probably still had friends willing to help him.

Similarities in literature=Aristophanes= Around the same time that the Republic was being composed, the playwright Aristophanes produced the play Assemblywomen. The state formed by the women in this play bears many similarities to the ideal government described by Plato. It is not discernible which was released first; most likely Aristophanes had heard an early form of the Republic before it was completed and used it as the basis for Assemblywomen. Certainly, the similarities have long been commented upon. =Utopias= Thomas More, when writing his Utopia, invented the technique of using the portrayal of a \\"utopia\\" as the carrier of his thoughts about the ideal society.

His citizen can be compared to a Platonic Guardian, without the communal breeding and property, but still having a militaristic base. Although there are significant differences in the specifics of the system, Heinlein and Plato both describe systems of limited franchise, with a political class that has supposedly earned their power and wisely governs the whole. Republic is specifically attacked in Starship Troopers.

He is also leader of the Software Systems Research Group (SSRG) at NICTA. In 2006 he co- founded Open Kernel Labs (OK Labs, acquired in 2012 by General Dynamics) to commercialise his L4 microkernel technology.  Life  Gernot Heiser was born in 1957. He studied physics at the German University of Freiburg, where he earned his BSc, went on to earn his MSc at the Canadian Brock University, and his PhD at the Swiss ETH Zurich.  Research  Heiser's research focuses on microkernels and microkernel-based systems as well as virtual machines, with a specific emphasis on performance and reliability. His group produced the Mungi single address space operating system, aimed at clusters of 64-bit computers, and implementations of the L4 microkernel with very fast inter-process communication. His Gelato@UNSW team was a founding member of the Gelato Federation, and focused on performance and scalability of Linux on Itanium. They established theoretical and practical performance limits of message- passing IPC on Itanium. Since joining NICTA at its creation in 2002, his research shifted away from high-end computing platforms towards embedded systems, with the specific aim of improving security, safety and reliability via the use of microkernel technology. This led to the development of a new microkernel called seL4, and its formal verification, claimed to be the first- ever complete proof of the functional correctness of a general-purpose OS kernel. His work on virtualization was motivated by the need to provide a complete OS environment on his microkernels. His Wombat project followed the approach taken with the L4Linux project at Dresden, but was a multi- architecture paravirtualized Linux running on x86, ARM and MIPS hardware. The Wombat work later formed the basis for the OKL4 hypervisor of his company Open Kernel Labs. The desire to reduce the engineering effort of paravirtualization led to the development of the soft layering approach of automated paravirtulization which was demonstrated on x86 and Itanium hardware. His vNUMA work demonstrated a hypervisor which presents a distributed system as a shared-memory multiprocessor as a possible model for many-core chips with large numbers of processor cores. Device drivers are another focus of his work, including the first demonstration of user-mode drivers with a performance overhead of less than 10%, an approach to driver development that eliminates the majority of typical driver bugs by design, device drivers produced from device test benches, and a demonstration of the feasibility of the automatic generation of device drivers from formal specifications. Recent research also includes power management. In the past he also worked on semiconductor device simulation, where he pioneered the use of multi- dimensional modeling in the optimisation of silicon-based solar cells.

Mason's portrait of a woman with elephantiasis, published in Fox. Oscar G. Mason (1830 - March 16, 1921), better known as O. G. Mason, was an American photographer and radiographer. For most of his professional life, O. G. Mason directed the photographic department of Bellevue Hospital in New York City. He retired from this position in 1906. Early years Very little information exists of Mason's activities as a daguerreotypist before he was engaged by Bellevue. Records show that he worked for the Meade brothers as chief camera operator at their 233 Broadway, New York, gallery soon after it opened in 1850.Craig. Mason. There is also evidence that Mason spent a few years in Northfield, Vermont and Springfield, Massachusetts, before returning to New York sometime in the middle 1860s.Craig. Meade. It is not clear, however, whether he actually resided in these cities or was simply registered as a freelance photographer and entrepreneur, promoting the services and products from his commercial enterprise, O. G. Mason & Company. According to his obituary in the New York Times, O. G. Mason's affiliation with Bellevue began in 1856.Times. There is very little evidence to support this date, but in a report written for the year 1881,Rowley. Report for 1881. Mason comments on twenty years of research in photomicrography. More than likely this would have included work for the department of microscopy established at Bellevue in 1862. For many years Mason was an officer of the American Microscopical Society of New York. Bellevue Photographic Department Blindstamp used by O. G. Mason The Bellevue Photographic Department was the first of its kind in a civilian hospital. Earlier photographic commissions could be found attached to American military hospitals that cared for wounded Union soldiers during the Civil War, but these precedents came under the authority and pay of the Army Medical Museum founded by Surgeon General Dr. William Hammond in 1862.Bengtson & Kuz. In France, Dr. Montm√©ja (1841-?) at H√¥pital Saint-Louis was photographing for Dr. Alfred Hardy's (1811‚Äì1893) atlas of skin diseases but it was not until 1869, when he and Dr. Jules Rengade (1841-?) announced plans for the construction of \\"un magnifique atelier de photographie\\" that would serve the hospitals of Paris.Montm√©ja & Rengade. The first photographic lab in a German hospital did not appear until 1893 at the Leipzig Medical Clinic. In 1868 after a year of planning, construction was completed on a department of photography within the former residents quarters of Cook House on Bellevue hospital grounds. Alterations included a 12 by 14 foot skylight and a partitioned space within the laboratory, presumably for a dark room, that measured 6 by 12. Financial oversight was the responsibility of apothecary John Frey and he published the first two reports for the department.Rowley. Report[s] --for 1868 & 1869. All subsequent reports were written by O. G. Mason and sometimes co-signed by Frey. From its inception, photographic production at Bellevue was ambitious and over 1200 positive paper prints were made in 1869.

O. G. Mason's duties included photographing deceased unknowns, a service that was pioneered at Bellevue in 1867.Rowley. Report[s]--for 1867 & 1881. Bodies were received in a new facility constructed in 1866, modelled and named after the much larger Paris Morgue.McCabe. Photographing took place outside and in his report for 1875 Mason petitioned for accommodations that would protect his equipment and subject from inclement weather. Unidentified bodies were displayed up to seventy-two hours on stone tables behind a curtain wall of iron and glass dividing the 20 by 20 foot space. Both photograph and body were numbered correspondingly and any unclaimed bodies were later buried at the Hart Island City Cemetery. Mason's annual reports emphasized the importance of this work and the relief it provided to the bereft who visited the morgue in search of missing loved ones. Works Eight-Inch Handscrew designed by O. G. Mason O. G. Mason was prominent in his field, a staff contributor to The Photographic Times weekly and The photographic instructor for the professional and amateur series, both publications put out by the press of Scovill Manufacturing Co. in the late 19th century. He served for a time as president of the American Institute, Photographic Section and as both secretary and treasurer, passim, for the American Microscopical Society.O. G. Mason was also a member of the American Photographical Society, the Photographic Society of Philadelphia, and the Photographic Exchange Club of Philadelphia (George Eastman House Catalog). Mason consulted for Lewis Morris Rutherfurd Morton. By 1865 he was actively printing Rutherfurd's negatives for the astronomer's photographic study of lunar phases. Mason disseminated Rutherfurd's as well as his own moon prints and later petitioned to have these images placed in New York public schools. on astronomic and spectral photography, and maintained a private office at 333 E. 26th Street for his telescopic and freelance projects. O. G. Mason is best remembered, however, for his clinical medical photography accomplished during his forty plus years at Bellevue Hospital. He was frequently called upon to provide illustrations for monographs published by leading physicians and surgeons associated with the hospital and its medical college, including Lewis Albert Sayre, John Call Dalton, and Francis Delafield.Wood.

In the CIA, he was known by code names BOURBON and ROAM, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) knew him as TOPHAT (Top Hat). Early life Born in Soviet Ukraine in 1921, he graduated from Sumy Artillery School in June 1941 and served as an artillery officer during World War II and was decorated for bravery. After the war and his studies at the M. V. Frunze Military Academy and GRU Training Courses, he joined Soviet Military Intelligence, the GRU. His first mission was with the Soviet delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations in New York City from 1951‚Äì1956. GRU officer and double agent On his second assignment to New York, United States in 1959‚Äì1961, he approached FBI counterintelligence agents to offer his services as an informant. His follow-up overseas assignments included Rangoon, Burma (1965‚Äì1969) and New Delhi, India (1973‚Äì1976 and 1979‚Äì1980) where he was posted as Soviet Military Attach√©. Some in the CIA feel that Polyakov became a mole because he was disgusted with the corruption of the Soviet Communist Party elite. Victor Cherkashin suggested that he was embittered because Soviet leadership denied him permission to take his seriously ill son, the eldest of three, to a hospital in New York where he could get adequate medical attention. This son died as a result of the illness and soon after, Polyakov began his informant activities. For 25 years, he remained a CIA informant as he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a general. CIA officers speak in superlatives about the kind of information he provided. Sandy Grimes said of him, \\"Polyakov was our crown jewel,... the best source at least to my knowledge that American intelligence has ever had and I would submit, although I certainly can't be certain, but the best source that any intelligence service has ever had.\\" James Woolsey said of him, \\"Polyakov was the jewel in the crown.\\" CIA and FBI officials, including Deputy Director William Sullivan, believed that, at some point, Polyakov was turned by the Soviets and made into a triple agent who deceived the West with misinformation. Among the important information Polyakov provided: * Evidence of the growing rift between the Soviet Union and China. This information played a crucial role in US President Richard Nixon's decision to open diplomatic relations with China in 1972. * Technical data on Soviet-made antitank missiles. While the US never fought the Soviet Union directly, knowledge of these weapons proved invaluable when Iraq employed them in the Gulf War. * Proof of spying done by Frank Bossard for the USSR. Arrest and execution Polyakov was arrested by the KGB in 1986, six years after his retirement from the GRU. His contacts at the CIA had no information about what might have happened to him. Only later, it became clear that he was betrayed by both Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames.Bagley, Tennent H.Spymaster, Startling Cold War Revelations of a Soviet KGB Chief, Skyhorse Publishing Inc, New York, Delaware, 2013. In 1988, Polyakov was sentenced to death for treason and was executed. Legacy CIA officer Jeanne Vertefeuille said, \\"He didn‚Äôt do this for money. He insisted on staying in place to help us.

[astro-ph/9304017] Inflation and Mixed Dark Matter Models Mixed dark matter is also called hot + cold dark matter. The most abundant form of dark matter is cold dark matter, almost one fourth of the energy contents of the Universe. Neutrinos are the only known particles whose Big-Bang thermal relic should compose at least a fraction of Hot dark matter (HDM), albeit other candidates are speculated to exist.Bogdan A. Dobrescu and Don Lincoln: A Hidden World of Complex Dark Matter Could Be Uncovered. Scientific American. Volume 313, Issue 1. pp. 20-27. In the early 1990s, the power spectrum of fluctuations in the galaxy clustering did not agree entirely with the predictions for a standard cosmology built around pure cold DM. Mixed dark matter with a composition of about 80% cold and 20% hot (neutrinos) was investigated and found to agree better with observations. This large amount of HDM was made obsolete by the discovery in 1998 of the acceleration of universal expansion, which eventually led to the dark energy + dark matter paradigm of this decade. The cosmological effects of cold DM are almost opposite to the hot DM effects. Given that cold DM promotes the growth of large scale structures, it is often believed to be composed of Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Conversely hot DM suffers of free- streaming for most of the history of the Universe, washing-out the formation of small scales. In other words, the mass of hot DM particles is too small to produce the observed gravitationally bounded objects in the Universe. For that reason, the hot DM abundance is constrained by Cosmology to less than one percent of the Universe contents. The Mixed Dark Matter scenario recovered relevance when DM was proposed to be a thermal relic of a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate made of very light bosonic particles, as light as neutrinos or even lighter like the Axion. This cosmological model predicts that cold DM is made of many condensed particles, while a small fraction of these particles resides in excited energetic states contributing to hot DM.

After the regicide of Charles I, in which he took no part, he was an active member of the three Protectorate parliaments and was knighted by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. Biography Lislebone Long baptised Loveban, was born at Beckington, Somerset, the son of William Long of Stratton on the Fosse and Mary Lovibond. He graduated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, 1630‚Äì31 with a B.A and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, 1640 Long was descended from the Longs of Wiltshire. In local affairs Long identified both before and during the Civil War with at least one of his Wiltshire relatives, Sir Walter Long, 1st Baronet of Whaddon who was an outspoken critic of the King. Like his cousin, he was a presbyterian and became an elder in parliament's presbyterian national church, with a later appointment to the parliamentary committee charged with settling the form of church government in England (1648). Following the end of royalist occupation, parliament's county committee in Somerset was revived in 1645, and Long was appointed as a member. Long was known for his moderate stance in politics, which was also demonstrated in parliament, following his election to the Long Parliament as a recruiter MP for Wells (1645‚Äì53). He voiced his strong opposition to Pride's Purge (6 December 1648), and on the day following the purge, he acted as a teller on a critical vote. After a few occasional appearances, he eventually absented himself from the House of Commons in protest. He became a conformist by taking his dissent and resuming his seat in the Rump Parliament, although he played no part in the trial and execution of Charles I. From that point on he played an active role in the work of committees, his moderating influence reflected in government policies. Long was also a regular participant in parliamentary debates. In the First Protectorate Parliament (1654‚Äì5), he served as MP for Wells; in the Second Protectorate Parliament (1656‚Äì8), for Somerset; and again for Wells in Richard Cromwell's parliament (the Third Protectorate Parliament) (1659). He was described by one of his contemporaries as 'a very sober, discreet gentleman, and a good lawyer', making intelligent contributions during sessions of the Cromwellian parliaments on points of law, precedent, and procedure. Highly respected within his local community, he was appointed Juistice of the Peace (JP) for Somerset 1654‚Äì9, elected Recorder of London in 1655, knighted by Oliver Cromwell in 1656, and that same year was appointed treasurer of Lincoln's Inn, a Master of Requests, and a Commissioner of Treasons. On 9 March 1659, the speaker of Richard Cromwell's parliament, Chaloner Chute, suddenly became indisposed as a result of being \\"tired out with the long debates and late sitting\\" (Diary of Thomas Burton, 4.92). This was after a long nine days debate, during which the House sat through one entire night up to 10 p.m. As a tribute to the high regard in which he was held, Sir Lislebone was duly elected ‚Äòby general consent of the House‚Äô (JHC, 7.612) to take the chair during the speaker's illness. Just one week later on 16 March, Burton notes in his diary that Long \\"being very sick, could not attend\\". He died later the same day and was buried at Stratton on the Fosse, leaving an estate which included a number of ecclesiastical and royalist lands purchased after confiscation by parliament. Family He had married on 18 February 1640 at London, Frances Mynne, daughter of John Mynne of Epsom.A pedigree of Mynne in relation to the manor of Horton, of which Woodecote Park was a sub-manor, may be found in Manning and Bray's History of Surrey.

History  The municipality was founded in 1860 thanks to migration from the neighbouring towns of Chin√°cota, el Chopo (today known as Pamplonita) and Villa del Rosario that emigrated to the limits of the T√°chira River (the river that divides Colombia and Venezuela). They traversed the mountain range because of the civil war of 1860‚Äì1862. Thus the first camps were established in the valley consisting of the streams Paso Antiguo and La Hormadera. In the historic archives are mentioned Miguel Contreras, Juan Tarazona y Rafael Quintero as the first to obtain property titles in these terrains. It was Quintero who drew in the initial settlers. The president of the Sovereign State of Santander Sol√≥n Wilches, through a decree of the 27th of September 1881, created the settlement of \\"Planadas\\". On the 3rd of September 1887, the Governor of Santander, General Alejandro Pe√±a Solano, erected the hamlets of Mundo Nuevo and \\"La Honda\\", and with Chin√°cota being the municipal seat its territory was attached to the judicial circuit of the notary of Chin√°cota. In 1892, Through a decree from the Assembly of Santander, it changed its name to Concordia in honour of the values of peace and unity rooted in the spirit of the first settlers.

Ceremonies surrounding the daily life of the king ‚Äî such as the lev√©e (the ceremonial raising and dressing of the king held in the morning) and the coucher (the ceremonial undressing and putting to bed of the king) ‚Äî were conducted in the bedchamber. In 17th century France under the absolutism of Louis XIV, the bedchamber became the focal point ‚Äî physically as well as ideologically ‚Äî of the palace of Versailles.The king‚Äôs bed chamber, which was used by Louis XIV from 1701 to his death and which served his successors as ceremonial bedchamber to the end of the Ancien R√©gime, is centrally located on the √©tage noble and overlooks the cour de marbre. The central east-west axis of the palace, city, and garden designs bisects this room. However, the bedchamber ‚Äî and more particularly the bed ‚Äî played a singular role in French cultural history during the Ancien R√©gime. While a throne has been associated with most European monarchies as a symbol of temporal authority, in France of the Ancien R√©gime, the throne was virtually non-existent. The only time that a throne, per se, was used during the Ancien R√©gime was during the king's coronation ‚Äî as which time it was known as the chaise du sacre ‚Äî and was used only for the ceremonies of anointing and crowning of the king. During the Ancien R√©gime, the true symbol of royal authority was the bed. On the morning of the king's coronationThe coronations of the kings of France were traditionally held in the cathedral of Reims; the coronation of Henri IV (27 February 1594) was held in Chartres on quasi-political grounds. one of the high-ranking ecclesiastic and one of the high-ranking secular peers of the realm (respectively, usually the archbishop of Laon and the duke of Burgundy; however, this varied depending on the internal politics at the time of the coronation) would arrive at the door of the king's bedchamber in the Palais de Tau (the archiepiscopal palace at Reims). The ceremony of the waking king would ensue: the peers would knock on the door of the king's bedchamber and ask, ‚ÄúWe have come for the king.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe is not here,‚Äù would be intoned from behind the door. The question would be placed twice more; the reply to the third time the question was asked, would be, ‚ÄúHe is not here, he is risen.‚Äù At which point, the door opened and the peers saw the king, fully dressed in his coronation robes, reclining on the bed. The two peers would then ceremonially lift the king to his feet and escort him to the cathedral for the coronation.Richard A. Jackson, Vive le Roi: A History of the French Coronation from Charles V to Charles X, (Chapel Hill & London: University of North Carolina Press, 1984). Monarchial rule in France under the Ancien R√©gime was autocratic and the king's will was obeyed, by and large, universally in the realm. However, there were occasions in which royal authority was challenged ‚Äî namely with the Parlements. During the Ancien R√©gime, France was divided into jurisdictions which presided ‚Äî in the name of the king ‚Äî over legal issues. The Parlement de Paris was the oldest and held sway over the provincial parlements. When royal edicts needed to be officially registered, they were sent to the Parlement de Paris (or provincial parlements, depending on the issue at hand). If the parlement judged the edict not to be in the interest of the state, it would refuse to register the edict. In such cases, the king would appear in state and would preside over a ceremony in which he would impose his will on parlement to force registration of the edict. This ceremony was call a lit de justice ‚Äî bed of justice. Rather than the king sitting on a throne, he would recline on a bed-like piece of furniture in order to preside over the ceremony. The bed as a symbol of royal authority was further emphasized in that the bed was always placed in an alcove that was separated by a decorative balustrade. Entry into the alcove behind the balustrade was strictly forbidden, unless authorized by the king. Additionally, during the Ancien R√©gime, court etiquette demanded that when one passed in front of the king's bed, reverence had to be paid: women deeply curtsied; men removed their hats and bowed. Furthermore, when the king died, a full-sized effigy would be placed on the bed and displayed publicly for two weeks, until the king's body had been interred in the royal crypt at the Basilica of Saint Denis. In many respect, the chambre du roi and the bed represented the unbroken continuation of the monarchy. For while the corporeal aspect of the king died, the spiritual ‚Äî which is to say the soul of the king and, by association, that of the state ‚Äî passed unbroken to the successor.

An eminent leader of Muslim Georgian community of Adjarians, he was a major proponent of pro-Georgian orientation in Adjara and one of the architects of the region's autonomy within Georgia. He became a victim of Joseph Stalin‚Äôs Great Purge. Biography Abashidze was born into the powerful Muslim Georgian noble house of Abashidze, rulers of Adjara for the Ottoman Empire. After Adjara was absorbed into Imperial Russia in 1878, Georgian intellectuals launched a campaign aimed at reincorporation of local Muslim Georgian community into the Georgian society. Mehmed‚Äôs father, Prince Ibrahim Abashidze, sided with this movement and helped open a Georgian school in Batumi in 1883. Born in Turkish-dominated Batumi, Mehmed attended this school. At the same time, he received a traditional education at home. Fluent in several languages, he began translating Arabic, Persian, and Turkish works into Georgian and authored the first Georgian textbook on the Arabic language and the first Turkish translation of the well-known medieval Georgian epic The Knight in the Panther's Skin by Shota Rustaveli (the manuscript of this translation was lost in the 1930s). Besides, Abashidze‚Äôs plays were staged in the recently opened Batumi Drama Theatre. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he became involved in the political life of Georgia. His brother, Aslan-Beg Abashidze, was a commander of one of the revolutionary detachments. From 1904 to 1908, he was a member of the Socialist Federalist Party of Georgia and advocated pro-Georgian orientation among the Adjarian Muslims. In 1908, the Russian persecutions forced him to flee to the Ottoman Empire where he was arrested. Back in Adjara in 1913, he was imprisoned by the Tsarist police and eventually exiled to Siberia. Prohibited from returning to Batumi, he stayed in Tbilisi after his release and led the Committee of Georgian Muslims for the Batumi District. Russia‚Äôs February Revolution of 1917 enabled to him to return to his native Adjara, where his Committee quickly turned into opposition to resurgent pan-Tukist movement and attempted to bring Christian and Muslim Georgians together. In November 1917, he was elected to the National Council of Georgia. During the Turkish occupation of Batumi in 1918, he stayed in the region and was arrested for his criticism of the Turkish authorities. He escaped from the Trebizond prison later that year and welcomed the declaration of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia in May 1918. When the British took control of Batumi from the Ottomans in December 1918, Abashidze returned to the city and organized the Congress of the People of Adjara which campaigned against the British installed government headed by the Russian Cadet Maslov. The movement forced the British military administration to organize local parliamentary elections on August 31 1919. Abashidze became chairman of the newly elected Mejlis (National Assembly) which was soon to become a scene of heated struggle between pro-Georgian and Turkophile factions. Abashidze renewed his campaign calling for the incorporation of Adjara into Georgia with an autonomous status and criticizing the Allies‚Äô attempts to turn Batumi into a free port. Upon the evacuation of the British, Georgian army entered Batumi on July 8 1920, but the question of Adjara‚Äôs autonomy remained still open. When Soviet Russia‚Äôs Red Army occupied Georgia in February-March 1921, Abashizde resigned his position in the Mejlis and chose a policy of reconciliation with the newly established Bolshevik regime. He became a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Batumi district and took part in drafting the first constitution of the Adjar ASSR. Although the Soviet authorities were suspicious of Abashidze, he was still well treated and received a pension thanks probably to his erstwhile ties with Joseph Stalin who worked in Batumi in the early 1900s. In 1935, he became the head of the Adjarian section of the Writers‚Äô Union of Georgia. During the Great Purges, however, he was arrested on trumped-up charges of treason and executed later that year. His family members were also repressed. Abashidze was rehabilitated only in 1957. His grandson, Aslan Abashidze, became an authoritarian ruler of Adjara in the 1990s and was ousted in 2004 shortly after the Rose Revolution in Georgia.  References  *Mikaberidze, Alexander.

He was religiously inclined from the early age. He worked as a contractor for a company maintaining dry docks in Bombay before attaining \\"self-realization\\" in 1958. He left business and focused on his spiritual goals. The movement around his teaching grew into the Akram Vignan movement gaining followers in western India and abroad. Biography=Early life= Ambalal Muljibhai Patel (A. M. Patel) was born on 7 November 1908 in Tarsali, a village near Baroda (now in Gujarat, India). His parents, Muljibhai and Jhaverba, were Vaishnava Patidars. He grew up in Bhadran, Kheda district in central Gujarat. A. M. Patel credited his mother for instilling an early appreciation of the values of nonviolence, empathy, selfless generosity, and spiritual penance within him. It is said that he was blessed by a saint when he was thirteen who told that he would attain liberation. He married a local village girl named Hiraba in 1924. Their children (born in 1928 and 1931) died a few months after birth so they had no surviving children. During this period, he was also influenced by the writings of Shrimad Rajchandra a Jain Monk who was also the spiritual Guru of Mahatma Gandhi and householder and religious teacher whose teaching inspired new religious movement later. He began practising temporary celibacy and later vowed lifelong celibacy. He was a contractor by profession. He moved to Bombay where he worked successfully as a contractor for the company Patel & Co. The company used to maintain and construct dry docks in the Bombay harbour. =Dada Bhagwan= He claimed to have attained self-realisation in June 1958 at Surat railway station while sitting on a bench at platform number 3. It was about 6 pm and it lasted 48 minutes. However this was not revealed initially by him. After his experience, a close relative began to address him by the spiritual name of Dada (a Gujarati term for \\"Revered Grandfather\\") Bhagwan (Lord) became his spiritual name. The experience or self-realization is described as revelation or manifestation of the god within, or pure self, supreme self manifested through body; which he later called Dada Bhagwan. He had differentiated between self and his empirical self as Patel and Dada Bhagwan. He left his business to his partners to concentrate on his spiritual goals. He continued to live on the dividends of his shares of company. He continued his householder life as his teaching did not require renunciation or asceticism. =Akram Vignan movement= Dada Bhagwan formed a movement which he termed Akram Vignan Movement. Unlike the step-by-step purification according to Jain principles, Akram Vignan promises instant salvation through the grace of Simandhar Swami, for whom Dada Bhagwan serves as a medium. His followers believe that they will be reborn in two lives in Mahavideha, a mythical land described in Jain cosmology from where they can achieve Moksha (liberation) as they are in connection with Gyani (knower). Fl√ºgel regards the movement to be a form of Jain-Vaishnava syncretism, a development analogous to the Mahayana in Buddhism. Initially, he had not revealed his experiences to the public but his some close relatives and friends knew it. In 1962, during a conversation with him, a person named Chandrakant Patel from Uganda experienced sudden self- realization. Such experience is described in traditional Jainism as kshayaka samyatva which is only achieved in presence of Tirthankara. Kanubhai K. Patel was the second person, who was also his business partner, who received instant knowledge in 1963 from Dada Bhagwan. =Expansion of movement= Between 1962 and 1968, very few close people received \\"knowledge\\" through Dada Bhagwan. Following 1968, he bestowed \\"knowledge\\" who requested to be blessed. This is the foundation of the movement. He said that he was initially reluctant due to fear of public opinion as in case of Shrimad Rajchandra but after his visit to a Rishabha temple in Khambhat he decided to public performance of Gnanvidhi, a practice to transfer of \\"knowledge\\" for self-realisation. In 1968, the first Gnanvidhi was held at Bombay. Over the years, the Gnanvidhi became more elaborate and achieved its present form in 1983. He continued to give spiritual discourses all over the world. He emphasized contact of \\"knower\\" (jnani) to gain knowledge over scriptural or ritual knowledge. His followers were initially spread in his hometown Vadodara and Bombay. The movement expanded in the 1960s and 1970s to southern Gujarat and Maharashtra and in Gujarati diaspora in East Africa, North America and UK. In 1983, he had reportedly around 50,000 followers. When he died on 2 January 1988, his funeral was attended by about 60000 followers. Succession Soon after the death of Dada Bhagwan, the movement split into two factions. One led by Kanubhai Patel as Jay Sachchidannad Sangh and other led by Niruben Amin known as Dada Bhagwan Foundation Trust and Simandhar Swami Aradhana Trust in Ahmedabad and Mahavideh Foundation in Mumbai. She became a popular leader of the movement and was addressed as Niruma by her followers from 1999. After death of Niruben in 2006, she was succeeded by Deepakbhai Desai. Recognition In 2012, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation named a stretch of road between Visat crossroads and Sabarmati crossroads as Pujya Dada Bhagwan Road and the Zundal circle as Dada Bhagwan circle. In popular culture Dada Bhagwan was portrayed by Gulshan Grover in a 2012 independent film Desperate Endeavors directed by French-Algerian director Salim Khassa.

It was free to join, and its members received a free subscription to Nintendo Fun Club News, a periodical that discussed popular games and games that were planned for the near future. It also offered tips and tricks, Nintendo video game news, and comics. History Since the NES's launch in 1985, warehouse manager and gamer advocate Howard Phillips and marketer Gail Tilden had operated a consumer feedback campaign of insert cards within packages of Nintendo's hardware and games, and built a database of customer contact information with names and mailing addresses. Phillips started a free-of-charge gameplay advice hotline at Nintendo of America, with five or six counselors on staff. They wanted to consolidate this resource-intensive gameplay counseling into mass media form. Phillips said, \\"When we first launched the NES in 1985, we figured out very quickly that kids were just dying to get extra information about the gamesnot just new games that were coming out, but also how to play them.\\" Nintendo Fun Club was started in 1987 by Gail Tilden and Fun Club President Howard Phillips, with the publication of the Nintendo Fun Club News. The newsletter's first four issues were delivered quarterly starting in late 1987, with the final three issues being bimonthly. Phillips said, \\"Kids loved the magazine because it included screen shots. Pre-internet and VCRs, actually showing kids the games was the only way to explain how to do tricks. They couldn't just look it up online.\\" The Nintendo Fun Club was marketed via catalogs and flyers contained in Nintendo Entertainment System boxes, as well as within the content of at least one game, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!. During the intermissions between rounds, when Little Mac's trainer is giving him hints to help him defeat his opponent, he sometimes says, \\"\\" After seven issues and 600,000 subscribers, along with more than 100 telephone gameplay counselors, Phillips and Tilden wanted to further streamline and expand the resource intensive and non-revenue-generating marketing outreach.

He led the attempted military coup of 1962. Family and education Born to Frederick De Saram, a Proctor, and Myra Loos, De Saram was educated at Royal College, Colombo, where he was Head Prefect and school cricket captain. He also won the coveted Dornhorst Memorial Prize. He then attended Keble College, Oxford, where he earned Blues in cricket and tennis. He was captain of the university cricket team. Cricket career A right- handed batsman, De Saram made 128 playing for Oxford University against the Australians in 1934. The Australian side included Stan McCabe, Chuck Fleetwood-Smith and Clarrie Grimmett. In his 40 first-class games for Ceylon and Oxford University, De Saram made 2789 runs at an average of 39.84 with six centuries and a highest score of 208. He captained the Ceylon cricket team from 1949 to 1954. For his service to sports, he was made an Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) (Civil Division) in the 1950 King's Birthday honours list. In later years he coached his alma mater, Royal College Colombo in Cricket. He was also actively involved with S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, and was conferred the status of being an honorary Thomian. He was cricket coach for Royal College Colombo, when his son, D. A. de Saram, played for St Thomas' as a coloursman at the Royal Thomian Cricket encounter. Legal career After his return to Ceylon, he became a barrister in the law firm, D. L. & F. De Saram one of the oldest law firms in the country, which was founded by his grandfather. Military service Joining the Ceylon Garrison Artillery (CGA) as a reservist, De Saram became a well-respected figure amongst his men. Mobilized for active service during World War II, he served as a Major in the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, CGA which was deployed to defend the vital Royal Navy base at Trincomalee. De Saram was battery commander of the anti- aircraft batteries deployed at Diamond Hill, Hoodstower and he personally commanded the Ostenberg anti-aircraft battery which provided air defence of Trincomalee during the Japanese attack on Trincomalee on 9 April 1942. Later he was approached by British Intelligence to serve with their underground should Ceylon fall to the Japanese in 1942.Coup of 1962: an inside story, by former diplomat T. D. S. A. Dissanayaka, son of C.C. \\"Jungle\\" Dissanayake In 1946 as a Major, De Saram served on the staff of the Governor of Ceylon as an Extra Aide-de-camp to the Governor. After the war, when Ceylon gained independence and the Ceylon Army was formed in 1949, De Saram was one of many officers of the Ceylon Defence Force who were absorbed into it as regular force. For his military service he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) (Military Division) in the 1950 King's new years honours list. Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he became the first commanding officer, 1st Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment which became the first regular regiment of the Ceylon Artillery. In 1956, De Saram, reverted to the volunteer force and became commanding officer, 2 (Volunteer) Light Anti Aircraft Regiment. Promoted to Colonel he was appointed as the Deputy Commandant of the Ceylon Volunteer Force in 1960. Coup De Saram was a member of the Christian elite that saw a gradual erosion of their influence and position in the country following the Sinhalazisation process started by De Saram's cousin, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, and carried on by Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Thus, De Saram, along with several other disgruntled Christian officers of the army, navy and police, began to plot a coup along the lines of that waged by General Ayub Khan. The coup d'√©tat was planned for midnight on 27 January 1962 under the leadership of De Saram with the support of troops from the Ceylon Artillery and Ceylon Armoured Corps as well as several other volunteer units. The plan was the detain the Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike at Temple Trees, the official residence of the prime minister, and round up government ministers, the Permanent Secretary for Defence and External affairs, the Inspector General of Police, DIG (CID), SP (CID), the Acting Navy Commander, and the Army Commander. Colombo would be placed under curfew and cut off from regular army units from the Panagoda Cantonment. After the coup members gained control, De Saram as General Officer Commanding Ceylon would command all military establishments and have Governor General Sir Oliver Goonetilleke dissolve parliament. However, an officer, who had been brought in on the plot the morning of the set date, warned the government and several of the plotters were arrested. De Saram drove to Temple Trees alone, but there he was arrested. Since no actual coup had taken place, the government had no real evidence to use to punish the accused and thus confined them to solitary confinement in hope of getting a confession. De Saram confessed taking sole responsibility of the coup. This would go on to become the prosecution's main article of evidence. On 3 June 1963, De Saram was convicted along with 11 of the other 24 accused to 10 years in jail as well confiscation of property after laws had been specially modified by the government in order to convict the plotters. The conviction was eventually overruled on appeal to the Privy Council, which ruled that the new Act had denied fair trial.\\"OPERATION HOLDFAST\\": THE ATTEMPTED COUP D‚ÄôETAT OF JAN 1962 Later life De Saram spent much of the 1970s as a partner of DL and F De Saram and coaching the Royal College, Colombo cricket and rugby teams. He died on 11 April 1983 at age 70. Family De Saram married Nedra Obeysekera, daughter of Stanley Obeysekera. They had two daughters, Tara and Oosha, who both excelled in sports at a national level, Tara in swimming and Oosha in both swimming and tennis.

Soldner Johann Georg von Soldner (16 July 1776 in Feuchtwangen, Ansbach - 13 May 1833 in Bogenhausen, Munich) was a German physicist, mathematician and astronomer, first in Berlin and later in 1808 in Munich. Life He was born in Feuchtwangen in Ansbach as the son of the farmer Johann Andreas Soldner. He received two years' teaching at the Feuchtwanger Latin School. Soon Soldner's mathematical talent was discovered: Soldner managed to measure the fields of his father by self-built instruments. At night, he studied math textbooks and maps. Since he never had been to high school, he pursued private studies of languages and mathematics in Ansbach, in 1796. In 1797, he came to Berlin, where he worked under the astronomer Johann Elert Bode as a geometer, and was involved with astronomical and geodetic studies. From 1804 to 1806, he was the leader of a team which worked on the survey of Ansbach. In 1808, he was invited by Joseph von Utzschneider to Munich to work on trigonometry for the newly formed Tax Survey Commission. For his services to the theoretical basis for the Bavarian land survey Soldner was knighted. In 1815 he was appointed as an astronomer and he was a member of the Academy of Sciences at Munich. In 1816, Soldner was appointed as the director of the observatory in Bogenhausen in Munich, which was built from 1816 to 1818 due to the co-operation of Utzschneider, Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach and Joseph von Fraunhofer. Beginning with 1828, Soldner was unable to completely fulfill his duties because of a liver disease. As a result, his young assistant Johann von Lamont (under his supervision) lead the operations of the observatory. Soldner died in Bogenhausen and was buried in the cemetery on the western side of the St. Georg church.Bauernfeind 1892 Work The Ramanujan-Soldner constant and the Soldner coordinate system are named for him. The latter was used until the middle of the 20th century in Germany. In 1809, Soldner calculated the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant's value to 24 decimal places. He also published on the logarithmic integral function. ;Light bending Soldner is now mostly remembered for having concluded ‚Äî based on Newton's corpuscular theory of light ‚Äî that light would be diverted by heavenly bodies. In a paper written in 1801 and published in 1804, he calculated the amount of deflection of a light ray by a star and wrote: \\"If one substitute into tang œâ the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the sun, and the radius on that body is set to unity, one finds œâ=0,84\\"\\". Soldner already noted that if it were possible to observe fixed stars in close distance to the sun, it might be important to take this effect into consideration. However, because (at that time) such observations were impossible, Soldner concluded that those effects can be neglected.Soldner 1804 Soldner's work on the effect of gravity on light came to be considered less relevant during the nineteenth century, as \\"corpuscular\\" theories and calculations based on them were increasingly considered to have been discredited in favour of wave theories of light. Other prescient work that became unpopular and largely forgotten for similar reasons include possibly Henry Cavendish's light-bending calculations, John Michell's 1783 study of gravitational horizons and the spectral shifting of light by gravity, and even Isaac Newton's study in Principia of the gravitational bending of the paths of \\"corpuscles\\", and his description of light-bending in Opticks.Jaki 1978Treder 1981Will 1988 Albert Einstein calculated and published a value for the amount of gravitational light-bending in light skimming the Sun in 1911, leading Phillipp Lenard to accuse Einstein of plagiarising Soldner's result. Lenard's accusation against Einstein is usually considered to have been at least partly motivated by Lenard's Nazi sympathies and his enthusiasm for the Deutsche Physik movement. At the time, Einstein may well have been genuinely unaware of Soldner's work, or he may have considered his own calculations to be independent and free-standing, requiring no references to earlier research. Einstein's 1911 calculation was based on the idea of gravitational time dilation. In any case, Einstein's subsequent 1915 general theory of relativity argued that all these calculations had been incomplete, and that the \\"classic\\" Newtonian arguments, combined with light-bending effects due to gravitational time dilation, gave a combined prediction that was twice as high as the earlier predictions.Laue 1921Will 2006 References ;Soldner's publications * * * ;Secondary sources  * ;Endnotes Category:1776 births Category:1833 deaths Category:German physicists ","title":"Johann Georg von Soldner"},{"id":"10401006","text":"Leighton Smith (b. 13 December 1946) is an Australian-born award-winning talkback radio host based in Auckland, New Zealand.

Baker umpired one first-class match in 1901.George Baker cricket umpire Retrieved 27 July 2012 Life and career Baker was born in New Malton, Yorkshire, England. He was a right- handed middle-order batsman, who scored 7,563 runs in 249 first-class matches, at an average of 21.28 with four centuries and 39 fifties. His best score was 186 against Sussex, and he posted 153 against Nottinghamshire, 140 against Hampshire and 109 against Kent. He was a fairly moderate performer until 1894, though his first century came in 1892. He passed 1,000 runs in a season only three times, with a best of 1,444 runs in 1897 at an average of 32.81. His three highest centuries came in that season, and his Lancashire aggregate and average in a season, in which the team won the County Championship, were exceeded only by Albert Ward. He took 152 catches and was an increasingly useful bowler, taking 145 first-class wickets at an average of 24.93 with his right-arm medium pace, including spells of 6 for 18 against Gloucestershire in 1896 and 6 for 28 against Sussex in 1898. Despite his apparently modest career figures, Baker was accorded a benefit season by Lancashire in 1898, which raised ¬£1,850. His obituary in Wisden in 1939 noted that he was a man of \\"happy disposition and popular with everyone\\". He left first-class cricket after the 1899 season, and was later coach at Harrow School for twelve years. Baker died in February 1938 at Wing Hill, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 75.

The role of moral syncretism The requirements of a global ethic call for \\"a minimal basic consensus relating to binding values, irrevocable standards and moral attitudes, which can be affirmed by all religions despite their undeniable dogmatic or theological differences and should also be supported by non-believers.\\" It cannot, however, make the specific ethics of the different religions and philosophies around the world superfluous or obsolete, nor should it strive to do so. Syncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and constructive interaction between different cultures (intercultural competence), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic realms. Conversely the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of \\"piety\\" and \\"orthodoxy,\\" may help to generate, bolster or authorize a sense of cultural unity in a well-defined minority or majority. While strengthening the ethical identity of the subgroup, this is often detrimental to the unity of the whole. Morality independent of religion A cornerstone of moral syncretism is that religion cannot be morality's only arbiter. The Dalai Lama, for example, has said that compassion and affection are human values that are independent of religion: \\"We need these human values. I call these secular ethics, secular beliefs. There‚Äôs no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things.\\" This notion is also supported by the traditional Judeo-Christian concept of natural law. In his book On Law, Morality and Politics, St. Thomas Aquinas identifies the innate rational nature of humans as being what defines moral law: \\"The rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts.\\" This does not, however, mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the Golden Rule, are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some Deists, prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics. =Atheism and morality= Most atheists argue that no religious basis is necessary for one to live an ethical life. They assert that atheists are as motivated towards moral behavior as anyone, or more, citing a range of non-theistic sources of moral behavior including: parental love, their conventional (or advanced) educated upbringing, natural empathy, compassion and the humane concern; respect for social norms, criminal law stemming from natural law, police or other enforced order (and in some cases society); and a desire for a good reputation and self-esteem. According to this view, ethical behavior is a natural consequence of altruistic motivation, not stemming from divine or tenet-prescribed system of punishment or reward in life and/or after death, though experiences and tentative expectations may instead play a role in forming and strengthening a moral atheist's motivations and ethics, united in rejection of any theory of all human beings' afterlife. Thus while atheism does not entail any particular moral philosophy, many atheists are drawn towards philosophies and worldviews such as: secular humanism, empiricism, objectivism, or utilitarianism, which provide a moral framework that is not founded on faith in deities. =Humanist ethics= Humanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of human nature and the belief that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our understanding of individual and joint interests, rather than a system of ethics stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, rejecting faith completely as a basis for moral action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility. The International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) is the worldwide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. Member organisations and individual members are required to accept the following statement: :Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality. Humanism is also known to adopt principles of the Golden Rule. As Oscar Wilde once said, \\"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.\\" This emphasizes a respect for other people's identities and ideals. =School of Economic Science= The School of Economic Science (SES) is an organisation based in Mandeville Place, London, founded by Leon MacLaren in 1937. Originally constituted to facilitate the study of economics, over time it came to focus on philosophy, particularly the Hindu tradition of Advaita Vedanta. In North America, the SES is also known as the School of Practical Philosophy, or by other similar names. In Australia, it is known as the School of Philosophy. Although the SES has been highly criticized for its methodology and alleged motives, it purports to be a syncretic school of moral philosophy. Religions that incorporate moral syncretism Several groups have taken on the challenge of establishing a world community through doctrine, faith and practice. =Unitarian Universalism= Unitarian Universalism is a theologically liberal religion characterized by its support of \\"a free and responsible search for truth and meaning.\\" This principle permits Unitarian Universalists a wide range of beliefs and practices. Some communities even offer a class called \\"Building Your Own Theology.\\" Many Unitarian Universalists consider themselves humanists, while others hold Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, pagan, atheist, agnostic, pantheist, or other beliefs. Some choose to attach no particular theological label to their idiosyncratic combination of beliefs. Others consider themselves to be Unitarian Universalists in theology and seek moral orientation in the Unitarian Universalist Association's Seven Principles and Six Sources. This diversity of views is considered a strength, since the emphasis is placed on a common search for a meaningful existence, rather than an adherence to a particular doctrine. =Universal Sufism= The philosophy of Universal Sufism revolves around a unity of all people and religions, as well as the ability to find beauty in all things. It is a form of Sufism that does not exist within the traditional framework of Islam and was most likely influenced by Advaita philosophy. Universal Sufism is characterised by its respect (if not inclusion) for other devotional traditions and its disapproval of miracles. It is mandated that Universal Sufis should strive to \\"realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out.\\" See also { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=top width=\\"45%\\" *Applied ethics *Atheism and morality *Ethics in politics and economics *Comparative morality among cultures *Meta-ethics width=\\"55%\\" *Moral relativism *Public morality *Secular ethics *World community *World peace } References Syncretism Category:Pluralism (philosophy) Category:Meta-ethics Category:Ethical theories Category:Syncretism ","title":"Moral syncretism"},{"id":"10401113","text":"Thor Able with Pioneer 1 at Cape Canaveral in Florida Thor was a US space launch vehicle derived from the PGM-17 Thor intermediate-range ballistic missile. The Thor rocket was the first member of the Delta rocket family of space launch vehicles. The last launch of a direct derivative of the Thor missile occurred in 2018 as the first stage of the final Delta II. Thor- Able LC-26B of the Air Force Space & Missile Museum Thor was first used as a launch vehicle during the testing program of the warhead reentry vehicle for the Atlas missile. For these three tests a Thor core stage was topped by the Able second stage. Able used the Aerojet AJ-10-40 engine from the Vanguard second stage. The first such launch, 116, was lost on 23 April 1958 due to a turbopump failure in the main engine. The recovery of the reentry vehicles on the succeeding two attempts were not successful. Three mice, one on each vehicle, died in these tests. The Able stage from the Atlas reentry vehicle tests was upgraded to become the Able I with a third stage consisting of an unguided Altair X-248 solid-fuel rocket motor. A Thor Able I was used in an attempt to place the 84 lb (38 kg) Pioneer 0 spacecraft into lunar orbit where it would take pictures of the lunar surface with a TV camera. The mission ended prematurely at 73.6 seconds after launch on 17 August 1958 due to a turbopump failure. On 7 August 1959, a Thor-Able was used to successfully launch Explorer 6, the first satellite to transmit pictures of Earth taken from orbit. = Ablestar = Ablestar was a liquid-propellant rocket stage burning hypergolic propellants fed from gas-pressurized propellant tanks. It was used as the upper stage, and provided improved performance. On 13 April 1960, a Thor-Ablestar launched Transit 1B, the first experimental satellite of what eventually became the Global Navigation Satellite System. On 22 June 1960, a Thor-Ablestar launched the first Galactic Radiation and Background (GRAB) electronic intelligence (ELINT) satellite for the United States Navy. These now-declassified satellites operated under a cover story of providing solar radiation data and included an electronics package to detect Soviet air defense radar signals. GRAB-1 was the world's first successful reconnaissance satellite, preceding the first Corona mission to return film (Discoverer 14 on August 18) by almost two months. On 29 June 1961, the Ablestar stage used to launch Transit 4A, which became the first object to unintentionally explode in space, creating at least 294 trackable pieces of space debris. =Thor- Delta= The Delta second stage was derived from the Able second stage. Members of the Delta rocket family derived from the Thor-Delta continue to launch satellites and space probes. By 1969, the Thor core was being used regularly both in Delta vehicles and in the USAF Standard Space Launch Vehicle (SLV-2), with thrust augmentation and a variety of upper stages. Thor- Agena Thorad-Agena D with SERT-2 satellite at Space Launch Complex 2 East (SLC-2E), Vandenberg AFB, California. Together with the Agena upper stage, Thor was the booster of the Thor-Agena vehicle used to launch the early Corona (also known as \\"Keyhole\\" and \\"Discoverer\\") satellites from Vandenberg AFB. These were the first photographic spy satellites, used for photographic surveillance of the Soviet Union, China and other areas. Thor-Agenas were used as launch vehicles for Corona satellites from June 1959 through May 1963. The Thrust Augmented Thor (TAT) was developed to handle the growing satellites of the Corona program. It added three Castor solid-fuel rocket strapon boosters-- each providing 53,000 lbf (236 kN) thrust--to the standard Thor core stage. The boosters were lit on the ground and jettisoned after burnout. The Thrust- Augmented Long Tank Thor/Agena incorporated modifications allowing 49,000 lb (22,000 kg) more propellant and was capable of sending payloads ranging from 1400 to about 2800 pounds into polar circular orbits. =Thorad-Agena= The Thorad-Agena (pictured) was developed from Thor. It used a Long Tank Thor to launch an Agena-D upper stage.

History Interlachen's history dates from November 16, 1909, when several members of the Bryn Mawr Golf Club decided to found a new golf club and purchased farmland alongside a suburban Minneapolis streetcar line. The club was officially incorporated on December 31, and the original golf course was opened on July 29, 1911. It was a nine- hole course, and was designed by Willie Watson, a well-known course architect of the time. George Sargent, who won the 1909 U.S. Open and was later president of the PGA of America, was the head professional for a few years. In 1919, the club decided to redesign the course. The new 18-hole course, which is largely the same today, was designed by Donald Ross and opened in 1921. Robert Trent Jones made some alterations in 1963, and Geoffrey Cornish renovated it in 1986. The course is consistently ranked Golf Digest's list of the 100 best courses in the United States (#44 in 2005, #62 in 2007), and #1 in Minnesota. The course is about 6,900 yards long, and is a par 72. The first major tournament held at Interlachen was the Western Open in 1914. In July 1930, the club was the site of the U.S. Open championship. Bobby Jones had already won the British Amateur and the British Open that year, and continued his run by winning at Interlachen by two strokes over Macdonald Smith. Jones completed his unprecedented Grand Slam by winning the U.S. Amateur later in the year. The club was scheduled to host the 1942 U.S. Open, but the event was cancelled after the outbreak of World War II. The club also hosted the 1935 U.S. Women's Amateur Championship, which was won by Glenna Collett Vare 3 & 2 over Patty Berg. Berg was a 17-year-old member of Interlachen, and was playing in her first national tournament. She went on to an illustrious amateur and professional career, and was a founding member of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). The 2002 Solheim Cup was held at Interlachen, with the United States retaking the cup by a score of 15¬Ω to 12¬Ω. Europe was ahead 9-7 heading into the last day, but the U.S. staged a comeback in the singles matches for the narrow win. Inbee Park won the U.S. Women's Open at Interlachen on June 29, 2008.

Raised in 1941 the Regiment took part in the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona in 1942‚Äì43, however, it did not see further action during the war and was disbanded in September 1945. History The 2/6th Armoured Regiment was formed in August 1941Handel 2003, p. 155. as part of the 1st Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel C.R Hodgson, the regiment recruited mainly from the state of New South Wales. It was initially located at Greta, New South Wales, and was equipped with Universal Carriers for training purposes, due to the shortage of other armoured vehicles. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the regiment was deployed to defend Coffs Harbour against a feared Japanese attack. In May 1942 the 2/6th Armoured Regiment was moved to Singleton, New South Wales, and was equipped with M3 Stuart light tanks. Later they moved to Narrabri, New South Wales, where they took part in large-scale divisional exercises with the rest of the 1st Armoured Division. In September 1942, the regiment's 'A' Squadron was deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea, making the 2/6th the first Australian armoured regiment to be deployed to an operational area in the Pacific theatre.Hopkins 1978, pp. 115‚Äì116. Subsequently, the regimental headquarters and 'C' Squadron were also deployed to Port Moresby, while 'B' Squadron was deployed to Milne Bay in November 1942. During December 1942, 'B' and 'C' Squadrons were shipped to Buna on the north coast of Papua to help break the deadlock in the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona. Although the lightly armoured Stuart tanks proved to be unsuited to jungle warfare and suffered heavy casualties, the regiment played an important role in the eventual Australian victory at Buna. In December, seven tanks were dispatched to take part in the fighting around Cape Endaiadere. Three Stuarts were lost on 18 December, while the other four were knocked out on 24 December when they were engaged by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery from point blank range. Reinforcements were brought up, though, and an attack was put in at Giropa Point on 29 December, although difficult terrain prevented a link up with the infantry. Further attacks occurred in January 1943 around the Sananada Track.Handel 2003, pp. 155‚Äì156. In April 1943 the regiment was relieved and returned to Australia.Hopkins 1978, p. 128. Upon its return to Australia the 2/6th Armoured Regiment was incorporated into the 4th Armoured Brigade, which was the Australian Army's specialist jungle armoured formation.Hopkins 1978, p. 130. The regiment was transferred to the 1st Armoured Brigade Group in Western Australia in early 1943, however, and did not see further combat.Handel 2003, p. 156. After the 1st Armoured Brigade Group was disbanded in September 1944 due to manpower shortages and the decreasing strategic need for armour, the regiment operated as an independent formation until it rejoined the 4th Armoured Brigade in July 1945. Following the end of hostilities, the 2/6th Armoured Regiment was disbanded in February 1946.Hopkins 1978, p. 177.

Fotheringham lived in Swaziland and Rhodesia as a child, and attended Ruzawi School and Michaelhouse. He represented Natal Schools at the 1969-70 Nuffield Week, and South African Schools at the 1970-71 Nuffield Week, and played rugby union, hockey, tennis, and squash at age group level. Originally a right-handed middle-order batsman, Fotheringham made his first- class debut for Natal B against Transvaal B in section B of the Currie Cup in December 1971, and in section A for Natal a month later in January 1972 against Rhodesia. His List A debut came for Natal in February 1974, in a Gillette Cup match against Rhodesia. Fotheringham moved to Transvaal ahead of the 1978-79 season, where he moved up the order and formed a prolific opening partnership with Jimmy Cook in a period when Transvaal dominated South African domestic cricket, before returning to play for Natal for the 1989-90 season. His final appearance for Natal came in the Benson & Hedges Series in March 1990. He also played two Second XI Championship matches for Gloucestershire in 1977. During his career Fotheringham scored 7,981 runs in the Currie Cup, the fifth-highest career runs total in the history of the tournament. Due to the sporting boycott of South Africa during apartheid, Fotheringham never played an official Test match or One Day International for South Africa. However, he played in seven unofficial Test matches and fifteen unofficial One Day Internationals during the South African rebel tours, making his debut against the West Indies XI during their 1983-84 tour.

This reactor is the oldest operating in the nation and has undergone numerous power upgrades, renovations, and other changes. The reactor serves the research purposes of the Penn State Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering as well as researchers from industry and other universities. Its total licensed thermal output is 1.1 MW, however the reactor is procedurally limited to 1.0 MW (for 100% operation). Reactor overview The BNR first went critical on August 15, 1955 making it the oldest operating reactor in the U.S. Other research reactors predate it but have since been decommissioned such as the first reactor at NC State. *In 1955 operation began at a rated power of 100 kW. *In 1960 the power was increased to 200 kW. *In 1962 and again in 1964 additions of laboratories, hot cells, a Co60 pool, offices, and a classroom were made. *In 1965 the reactor was upgraded from the plate fuel type with highly enriched MTR fuel to a 1 MW TRIGA core and pin fuel type. Also, enrichment was decreased from 93% to less than 20%, making the core classified as LEU. The design also allowed pulsing capabilities of up to 2000 MW. This pulse power level can be varied, and pulse length is approximately 250 ms. *In 1986 the license for the reactor was renewed for another 20 years. *In 2009 the license for the reactor was renewed for another 20 years. In 1999 54 faculty and staff, 27 graduate students, and 30 undergraduate students performed research at the facility, and nine master's theses and five doctoral dissertations were completed. Every year around 3,000 people participate in tours or other activities. Overview The mission of the reactor is defined as outreach, education, research and service. First and foremost there is a commitment to ensure the safety of the public with an emphasis on education. To achieve this, the reactor maintains an open atmosphere. An 'open house' is given in tandem with the College of Engineering at Penn State (usually the 3rd to 5th week in the Fall Semester) in which members of the public are given access to the facility to observe reactor operations, ask questions and seek answers. There is a firm belief in \\"atoms for peace\\" as defined by President Dwight Eisenhower. Research and irradiation facilities Neutron activation analysis (NAA) has been practised for decades here in various forms. Currently, graduate student programs are constructed using this technology. This is a sub-parts-per-million compositional analysis technique that is comparable to modern mass-spectrometry systems. Neutron radiography uses the beam port facilities to image materials (similar to x-ray techniques) but has advantages when using hydrogen-bearing materials (e.g. water or plastics) as this is not effective for x-ray imaging. This has been used extensively over the years but now is focused research work for the Penn State Fuel Cell Project for the Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering at Penn State. Neutron depth profiling (NDP) is a technique for analysis of composition and density that is well suited for semiconductor films characterization.

This week is referred to as the \\"Week of Palms\\" or the \\"Flowery Week.\\"Sergei Bulgakov, Nastolnaya Kniga Dlya Svyaschenno-Tserkovno- Sluzhitelei (Handbook for Church Servers), 2nd edition (Kharkov, Ukraine, 1900), Tr. Fr. Eugene Tarris. The Sixth Week of Great Lent . Accessed 2007-04-02. The position of Lazarus Saturday is summed up in the first sticheron chanted at vespers on Friday:The Orthodox Church follows the Jewish tradition of beginning the day at sunset; thus, Lazarus Saturday begins at Friday vespers. Having completed the forty days that bring profit to our soul, we beseech Thee in Thy love for man: Grant us also to behold the Holy Week of Thy Passion, that in it we may glorify Thy mighty acts and Thine ineffable dispensation for our sakes, singing with one mind: O Lord, glory to Thee. During Friday vespers the reading of Genesis (which began on the first day of Great Lent) is concluded with the description of the death, burial and mourning of Jacob () and on Friday night, at compline, a Canon on the Raising of Lazarus by Saint Andrew of Crete is sung; this is a rare full canon, having all nine canticles. The Raising of Lazarus -- Late 14th ‚Äî early 15th Century. Byzantium From the Collection of G. Gamon-Gumun. Russian museum The scripture readings and hymns for this day focus on the raising of Lazarus as a foreshadowing of the Resurrection of Christ and a prefiguring of the General Resurrection. The Gospel narrative is interpreted in the hymns as illustrating the two natures of Christ: his humanity in asking, \\"Where have ye laid him?\\" (), and his divinity by commanding Lazarus to come forth from the dead (). A number of the hymns, written in the first or second person, relate Lazarus' death, entombment and burial bonds symbolically to the individual's sinful state. Many of the resurrectional hymns of the normal Sunday service are sung while prayers for the departed, prescribed on Sundays, are permitted. During the divine liturgy, the baptismal hymn, \\"As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ\\" () replaces the Trisagion indicating that this had been a day on which baptisms were performed and in some churches nowadays adult converts are still baptized on this day. =Fasting= Although the forty days of Great Lent end on Lazarus Friday, this day is still observed as a fast day; however, the fast is mitigated to allow consumption of caviar, eggs being a symbol of the resurrection and prominent on Pascha, and fish eggs being a shadow thereof show the raising of Lazarus as a foreshadowing of Christ's Resurrection, as elucidated in the propers of the day. Customs=Hermits= A lazarakia.Lazarus Saturday is the day when, traditionally, hermits would leave their retreats in the wilderness to return to the monastery for the Holy Week services. In many places in the Russian Church, the vestments and church hangings on this day and on Palm Sunday are green, denoting the renewal of life. In the Greek Church, it is customary on Lazarus Saturday to plait elaborate crosses out of palm leaves which will be used on Palm Sunday. =Greece and Cyprus= Baking lazarakia to eat on Lazarus Saturday is a tradition practiced in Greece and Cyprus. It is said to have originated in Cyprus, and it is significant that St. Lazarus was their first bishop. The bread is a mildly sweet Lenten bread made with sweet-smelling spices that looks like Lazarus bound up in grave clothes. =Serbia and Bulgaria= Lazarus Saturday in Gara Bov (Bulgaria) The feast of Vrbica (–í—Ä–±–∏—Ü–∞) or Lazareva Subota (–õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∞ –°—É–±–æ—Ç–∞), is commemorated by Serbian Orthodox and Bulgarian Orthodox tradition. Due to a general lack of palm trees, pussy willow branches are blessed, and distributed to the faithful. Small bells are often tied to the branches. Other features include: *Burning a fire against vermin and snakes *Picking flowers and herbs which are put in water to either drink or swim in *Lazarice ritual, a procession, parade of six maids History The antiquity of this commemoration is demonstrated by the homilies of St. John Chrysostom (349 - 407), St Augustine of Hippo Regia (354 - 430), and others. In the 7th and 8th centuries, special hymns and canons for the feast were written by St. Andrew of Crete, St. Cosmas of Maium and St. John Damascene, which are still sung to this day.

He entered the Augustinian order in 1757. To further his studies, he went to Pavia and Parma where he also taught ecclesiastical law. Wide- ranging intellect Amoretti was an Encyclopedist whose mind encompassed theology, physics, geology, paleography, geography, and art history. He translated scientific works, published or republished many rare books and manuscripts noteworthy of these being the extant codex of Antonio Pigafetta's relation of the first circumnavigation of the world by Ferdinand Magellan's fleet. Amoretti, having fallen from the graces of the ecclesiastical order at Parma, was forced to relocate to Milan around 1771. Here he became an active member of the scientific community. He was editor of the first scientific magazine published in Milan under the title‚Äîfrom 1775 until 1777--Scelta di opuscoli interessanti tradotti da varie lingue renamed in 1778 Opuscoli scelti until 1803, and further renamed in 1804 as Nuovi opusculi scelti. Polygraph Amoretti wrote many books. Among these Memorie storiche su la vita gli studi e le opera di Leonardo da Vinci si aggiungono le memorie intorno all vita del Ch. Baldassare Oltrocchi gia Prefetto della stessa Biblioteca scritte dal suo successore Pietro Cighera (Milan, 1804) which is considered to be the first modern biography of Leonardo da Vinci. Other works worth mention are Della raddomanzia ossia elettrometria animale ricerche fisiche e storiche (Milan, 1808), Elementi di elettrometria animale (Milan, 1816), and Viaggio da Milano ai tre laghi Maggiore, di lugano e di Como e ne' monti che li circondanoi (Milan, 1814). Conservator, discoverer of Pigafetta He became a conservator, officially called \\"Dottori del Collegio Ambrosiano\\", in 1797 of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana (Ambrosian Library) at Milan which is said to be the first public library in Europe having first opened its door to the public in 1609. It was as conservator at the library that the world of exploration history was turned on its head by this paleographer. James Alexander Robertson wrongly identified him as the \\"prefect\\" or officer in charge of the Ambrosiana library, an error repeated by a few who have referred to Amoretti although as far as can be ascertained not one has detected prior to this article that Amoretti is the first to assert the Limasawa=Mazaua equation. Filipino religious historiographer Miguel A. Bernad mistakenly identified Amoretti as curator of the library. In 1797 Amoretti discovered at the Biblioteca the lost Italian manuscript of Pigafetta on Magellan's voyage, considered by most Magellan scholars as the oldest of four extant manuscripts and the most complete, although there is consensus among paleographic scholars this and all surviving codices are mere copies of an original or originals now deemed forever lost. The three other extant manuscripts are all in French of which two are conserved at the Biblioth√®que Nationale, MSS 5650 and 24224, the last, viewed as the most \\"princely\\" of all, is conserved at the Beinecke Library of the Yale University Library, in the United States. =Garbled edition= Amoretti lost no time in transcribing, editing, and annotating the manuscript. He published his edition of Pigafetta in 1800 under this most formidable title Primo viaggio intorno al globo terracqueo ossia ragguaglio della navigazione alle Indie orientali per la via d'occidente fatta dal cavaliere Antonio Pigafetta patrizio vicentino sulla squadra del capit. Magaglianes negli anni 1519-1522 ora pubblicato per la prima volta, tratto da un codice MS. della Biblioteca Ambrosiana di Milano e corredato di note da C. Amoretti...con un transunto del Trattato di Navigazione dello stesso autore... Milan, 1800. The following year a French edition, translated by Amoretti himself, came out with the title Premier voyage autour du monde par le chevalier Francesco Antonio Pigafetta sur l'escadre de Magellan, pendant les ann√©es 1519-20-21-22, suivi de l'extrait du Trait√© de navigation du m√™me auteur et d'une notice sur le chev. Martin de Behain. Paris, H.J. de Jansen. That same year a German translation came out. The French edition has been digitized and published at the site Europeana. Among other things Amoretti modernized the Italian of Pigafetta's text. His edition was the basis for the writings on Magellan's expedition by Jose Toribio Medina and Francis Hill H. Guillemard whose biography of Magellan is still considered the leading work on the Portuguese navigator. Navigation historians and Magellan scholars, among them James Alexander Robertson, Donald D. Brand, and Martin Torodash, fault Amoretti's edition for taking liberties with Pigafetta's text. Robertson accused Amoretti of committing \\"the sin of editing the precious document, almost beyond recognition.\\" Brand describes the work as \\"somewhat garbled.\\" Theodore J. Cachey Jr. (The First Voyage Around the World, (1519-1522), An Account of Magellan's Expedition by Antonio Pigafetta, New York: 1995) called Amoretti's edition as having \\"bowdlerized the text in an effort to 'exposit with the necessary decency the account of some strange customs written by him [Pigafetta] in frank terms which would offend the delicacy and modesty of the reader of good taste.\\" =Creator of grand geographical illusion= Even while it is so poorly regarded Amoretti's work has left an enduring geographical puzzle‚Äîan invalid geographical assertion‚Äîwhich has only been recently detected. In two footnotes on pages 66 and 72, Amoretti surmised that Magellan's port‚Äîwhich he named Massana and appears otherwise as Mazaua or Mazzaua in the clear calligraphic writing of the Beinecke-Yale codex, where the Armada de Molucca anchored from March 28 to April 4, 1521‚Äîmay be the Limassava in a map of the Philippines by French cartographer Jacques N. Bellin. Bellin's map is a perfect copy of a chart made by Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde, S.J., of the Philippines in 1734. Murillo's map was such a brilliant and beautiful map many European mapmakers plagiarized it outright. To the credit of Bellin, he cites Murillo as his authority; he corrects Murillo's longitude which followed the erroneous entry of Pigafetta. The French Bellin was hydrographer to the king of France and one of the greatest and most important French cartographers of the mid-18th century. His works were of such excellence as to set a high standard and were widely copied throughout Europe. His map of the Philippines came out the same year that Murillo's map came out. In any case, Amoretti offers one proof in support of his guess: the latitude of Limassava is at Pigafetta's latitude for Mazaua at 9¬∞40' North. He was mistaken on two counts, Limasawa is at 9¬∞56' North while Mazaua had three latitude readings by three members of the Armada, 9¬∞40' N by Pigafetta, 9¬∞20' N by Francisco Albo, and 9¬∞ N by the Genoese Pilot. Mazaua was the port where Magellan's fleet anchored for one week. It was also the port where 22 years later, Gin√©s de Mafra, revisited, the only crewmember of the Armada to do so. There are other visits by Spanish and Portuguese during the entire Age of Sail, the last notable one a few months before the 1565 arrival of the Legazpi expedition being a Portuguese squadron that virtually wiped out the entire population of the isle except for one native who was able to hide. =Limasawa, an invented word= The word Limasawa is not found in any of the over 100 languages of the Philippines. It is not found in any of the eyewitness reports that mention the episode of March 28-April 4, 1521 as written by Antonio Pigafetta, Gines de Mafra, Mart√≠n de Ayamonte, Francisco Albo, and The Genoese Pilot. In fact, it was invented in 1667 by a Jesuit historian who had not read any of those accounts. Fr. Francisco Comb√©s, S.J., had read three works that refer to the Mazaua episode: by Giovanni Battista Ramusio, who said the port was \\"Buthuan\\", and this Comb√©s adopted; by Antonio de Herrera, who said it was \\"Mazaua\\", which Comb√©s rejected; and by Fr. Francisco Col√≠n, S.J., who said the island was Butuan. Col√≠n pointed to another island he called Dimasaua to signify it is not (di is Bisaya for not) the isle where an Easter mass was celebrated. The island is Pigafetta's Gatighan. In the case of Comb√©s, who wrote five years after Col√≠n, he did not adopt Dimasaua because his story does not mention any mass at all. =Amoretti, ignorant of Col√≠n, Comb√©s, de Mafra, Albo, etc.= Amoretti had not read Col√≠n and Comb√©s and was unaware that their Dimasawa and Limasawa were born of ignorance of the true Mazaua episode. That the island whose names they invented pointed to Pigafetta's Gatighan. Amoretti also had not read the French manuscripts of Pigafetta which described Mazaua, Magellan's lost harbor, as having plenty of gold mines, and the other firsthand accounts by de Mafra, Albo, the Genoese Pilot, and Ayamonte. These uniformly referred to an island with an excellent port. Limasawa has no anchorage. His claim asserting identity between Limasawa and Mazaua was false from the very basic level of anchorage. =Uncritical acceptance of Amoretti= Navigation historians and Magellan scholars who followed in the wake of Amoretti adopted uncritically his Limasawa=Mazaua dictum. Not one raised any question or doubt. Among these were Lord Stanley of Alderley, Jose T. Medina, F.H.H. Guillemard, Andrea da Mosto, Charles McKew Parr, James Alexander Robertson, down to the latest authors like Laurence Bergreen. By the time Robertson came into the picture, Amoretti's guess became a certainty, this without any additional argument or evidence. Mazaua, declared Robertson, \\"is doubtless the Limasaua of the present day.\\" It was de rigueur for Magellan writers to state that Limasawa was Pigafetta's Mazaua. In 2003 Bergreen broke away from this and completely disregards the name \\"Mazaua\\" altogether, he names the port Limasawa without citing Pigafetta's \\"Mazaua.\\" =Amoretti name unknown in the Philippines= Philippine historians and historiographers who have written on Magellan and the Mazaua episode are totally ignorant of Amoretti. This incredible phenomenon may be explained by the practice or non-practice of modern historiography which is marked by a strict if not reverential respect for authorship. In the Philippines, Amoretti's dictum was completely accepted but his authorship unrecognized if not indeed appropriated. His assertion was reworked in such a manner as to make it look new and original. Instead of saying what Amoretti said that \\"Limasawa may be Mazaua\\" Philippine historiographers reframed it as \\"the site of the first mass\\" (Mazaua) is not Butuan (Gian Battista Ramusio's version) but Limasawa. The framework finally blossomed to the classic question, \\"Where is the site of the first mass, Limasawa or Butuan?\\" This proposition forces the reader to choose between two false options, an isle that has no anchorage, Limasawa, and a place that is not an isle, Butuan. Only with the discovery of the Gin√©s de Mafra account and by tracing the Limasawa=Mazaua dictum to Amoretti was it possible to see that Amoretti's assertion was based on ignorance of all the eyewitness accounts which he had not read and the accounts of Col√≠n and Comb√©s whose invented names did not point to Magellan's port. De Mafra described a port that was in the Genoese Pilot's 9¬∞N; at this location, all the other's testimonies converged, harmonized to create a unified whole and a consistent truth. =Amoretti's Limasaua is Pigafetta's Gatighan= The notion Amoretti propounded that Limasawa is Mazaua is based on ignorance of a basic fact: Limasawa has no anchorage as described by the Coast Pilot of 1927 published by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey states, \\"Limasawa is fringed by a narrow, steep-to reef off which the water is too deep to afford good anchorage for large vessels.

The open waters to the North of the spit, are among the deepest in Puget Sound. Local magnetic disturbances of more than 2¬∞ from normal variation have been observed in Hood Canal at Point Hannon.

Shanghaied crew aboard inbound clippers, loggers, and other freighters were waylaid at Whiskey Spit so that they would not escape, and they were replaced by Native crews for the remainder of the sail into Puget Sound and back.

Established to ward mariners off a reef that extends lakeward from Sturgeon Point, it is today regarded as a historic example of a Cape Cod style Great Lakes lighthouse. History The light station was built in 1869 by the United States Lighthouse Board. The Board was in the midst of a lighthouse building boom on the Great Lakes due to increased maritime traffic, and in response to a large number of lost ships and men: Congress approved 70 lights on the western Great Lakes in thirty years: 28 in the 1850s, and 21 in each of the following decades.See also the chronology at The location is roughly halfway between Alpena's Thunder Bay Island and the northern entry to Saginaw Bay. Importantly, this point sits atop a formidable reef that is an imminent hazard to navigation. Moreover, the area north of Sturgeon Point and south of Alcona, Michigan is a bay that can provide shelter from northerly and southerly winds and waves. Historically, this area is locally known as \\"Sanctuary Bay,\\" which is in distinct contrast to \\"Misery Bay\\", the area to the north, between Alpena and Thunder Bay Island. The Lighthouse Board further recognized that being able to navigate close to (but not over) the reef and the point would aid transport into and out of Saginaw Bay. It is made of brick masonry on an ashlar limestone foundation. The tower stands in height, with a diameter of at the base. The focal plane is listed by the Coast Guard at , which would be the height from the \\"mean high water mark,\\" That figure is important, in that it could be used by mariners to chart their location, using a method of triangulation to give them the distance to the light. The adjoining, two-story Lighthouse keeper‚Äôs quarters was designed in the Cape Cod style and built of the same materials. At the time, the Board was often using this architectural motif. In fact, Poverty Island Light, built in 1874, is considered to be a \\"sibling\\" as it is a direct copy of Sturgeon Point. The light was set to begin its service with a sixth-order Fresnel lens which was upgraded to a 3¬Ω-order lens (that was originally installed at Oswego, New York). It was one of only a dozen used around the country, most of which were on the Great Lakes. The other Great Lakes 3¬Ω-order lenses were at (in alphabetical order): DeTour Reef (two 3¬Ω-order lenses, after the bivalve lens broke), Eagle Bluff, Grays Reef, Huron Island, Michigan Island, St. Helena Island, and Toledo Harbor. which mistakenly does not list this among the Great Lakes 3¬Ω-order lights. The lens at Sturgeon Point is without a doubt a third-and-a-half order lens. As Terry Pepper, Executive Director of the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keeper Association, wrote on August 6, 2012: \\"I have measured it personally.\\"E-mail from Terry Pepper dated August 6, 2012 As further proof, on July 22, 1870, the District Lampist visited the Station and made the following entry in his inspection journal: \\"Sturgeon Point, No. 449 ‚Äì This is a new station first lighted to the opening of navigation this spring. The illuminating apparatus consists of a 3 ¬Ω Order Fresnel lens of 270¬∞, Henry Lepaute maker, and is fitted with Funck‚Äôs hydraulic float lamps, showing a fixed white light. The illuminating apparatus was in excellent condition with the exception of one of the spare burners which had been damaged. It was taken on board for repairs. A spirit lamp to aid in heating the oil in severe cold weather is required.\\"District Lampist Inspection Journal, July 22, 1870. The Journal may be found in the National Archives in Washington. However, for reasons unknown, there are conflicting reports as to the size of the present lens, with some reporting it as a third order, and orders as a 3¬Ω-order Fresnel lens. The 3¬Ω-order Fresnel lens is still in place and was in use as of July 31, 2012. This is one of only 70 such Fresnel lenses that are still operational in the United States, sixteen of which are use on the Great Lakes of which eight are in Michigan. which reports that Sturgeon Point is the larger third order lens, not the somewhat smaller (and more rare) 3¬Ω-order See also, which disregards Sturgeon Point and Bete Grise Light (which has its original lens), and proffers a count of \\"four remaining lenses\\" -- it lists them -- on the Great Lakes. However, it appears to may be that the article is only intending to list lights that have \\"their original lens in situ\\" \\"For example, on the Great Lakes, only three others besides Grosse Point have retained their Fresnel lenses in place since being installed: a fourth-order lens at Little Traverse Harbor, Michigan (1884), a third-order lens at Split Rock, Minnesota (1910), and a third-order lens at Presque Isle Light, Michigan (1871) {footnotes omitted.]\\" and by that definition, Sturgeon Point is not on that list, as it has a larger replacement lens. According to the Life Saving Service's District Lampist, the upgrade occurred within the first year of operation, not in 1889 as indicated by some sources. In 1876, the light station was joined in its service by an adjacent United States Life-Saving Service station. There is no question that the presence of this light on this highly dangerous reef has forestalled \\"countless accidents.\\" ; . In 1875, a U.S. Life-Saving Service station was opened. The first light keeper became the first captain of the surf team. In 1915, this station became part of the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1939 the U.S. Lighthouse Service also merged under the control of the U.S. Coast Guard. In the same year the station was electrified and automated. By the 1940s, the light was fully automated, and the Coast Guard withdrew all personnel in 1941 and thereafter dismantled the life-saving station. One source claims (erroneously) that the lifesaving saving station and the lighthouse were \\"abandoned\\" in the 1940s; in point of fact personnel were withdrawn, but the light remains an active aid to navigation to this day. .Thunderbay National Marine Sanctuary, Sturgeon Point Light. The lifesaving bell was stolen in 1951, and was \\"anonymously returned\\" in 2002 to the custody of the Alcona County Historical Society (according to a plaque at the light). The fog horn building was torn down. The brick outhouse, built in 1869, remains, however. The Life Saving station's foundation is still visible. The lifesaving watch tower also was torn down.Photograph of life saving watch tower, Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light. In 1982 the Alcona Historical Society leased the light and began a three-years restoration project. The keeper's house itself fell into disrepair until it was taken over by the Alcona Historical Society in 1982. =Historic context= The light and United States Life-Saving Service station in approximately 1900-1910. *At the time of the light station's construction, the Alcona County region hosted an active commercial fishery. Northern Michigan was also in the midst of a timber boom, during which wood products were shipped to markets over Lake Huron from nearby ports at Harrisville, Alcona, and Black River. Despite the later addition of agricultural produce to the cargoes shipped by lake from the region, by the early 20th century the Sturgeon Point Light primarily served passing vessels engaged in the bulk mineral trade, which did not stop at nearby ports. *Sturgeon Point is one of over 150 past and present lighthouses in Michigan. Michigan has more lighthouses than any other state. See Lighthouses in the United States. *In the Big Blow of 1913, two of three ships that had the most crew lost, 28 victims each, were thereafter reported to have gone down in the area near Sturgeon Point. Those ships are the John A. McGeanThumb Shipwreck Preserve, John A. McGean. and the Isaac M. Scott. See also, Shipwrecks of the 1913 Great Lakes storm and List of victims of the 1913 Great Lakes storm. However, the better evidence suggests that the McGean is in fact due east of Harbor Beach, Michigan, which is on the east side of Michigan's Thumb.The Lakeshore Guardian :: December 2003 :: Sunken History The Scott was first discovered in 1976, and is lying on the bottom about northeast of Thunder Bay Island. Contemporary status Undated aerial image by USCG Ownership was transferred from the Coast Guard to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources under the terms of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act, and operations are maintained by the Alcona Historical Society. The site is part of the Sturgeon Point State Park under the auspices of the Michigan DNR. During the planning stages of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the Sturgeon Point Light was proposed to mark the southernmost extent of the sanctuary, although the final sanctuary boundary was drawn short of the light. Nevertheless, 15 historic shipwrecks have been identified with place of loss listed as \\"Sturgeon Point\\". Indeed, the question of expanding the National Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve continues to be a subject of inquiry and discussion.Testimony by Jefferson Gray, Superintendent of Thunder Bay Marine Sanctuary concerning its expansion, May 6, 2008. Although the United States Coast Guard continues to operate the light, the property has been transferred to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources under the terms of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. The transfer from the Department of the interior was effective May 2005.Department of Interior News Release. The Alcona Historical Society operates a museum in the restored historic buildings. The Sturgeon Point Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Sturgeon Point, on which the lighthouse is built, is a Michigan Scenic Site overseen by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. It is listed as part of the National Maritime Heritage Program with the National Park Service.National Park Service Maritime Heritage Sites The station structure is also listed as a state historic site in February 1982.Sturgeon Point Light Station , Historic Sites Online, Michigan Department of History, Arts and Libraries Additionally, it is on the National Register of Historic Places, Reference #84001370, Name of Listing: STURGEON POINT LIGHT STATION (U.S. COAST GUARD/GREAT LAKES TR) and is also on the state inventory, being listed in 1969.National Park Service, Inventory of historic light stations, Sturgeon Point. In 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard sought to forever darken the light, and in fact shut it off for a short time. Resistance to the initiative developed, and over five thousand signatures were collected on petitions to \\"Save Our Light.\\" Numerous public comments were submitted as part of the regulatory process. In due course, an arrangement was made whereby the light was left on (albeit with its operating expenses to be paid by the Alcona County Historical Society) and it was designated as an official \\"seasonal private aid to navigation.\\" from April 1 through November 1.Archive of LNM announcements District 9, week 1/2009, (file lnm09012009.pdf) The Coast Guard reversed course after the public pressure, and after the intervention of Senator Debbie Stabenow and the fresnel lens and the light remained on through July 2012. A transfer of ownership of the light itself, from the Coast Guard to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, is still languishing as of 2012 under the terms of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act.

The Society is in the process of raising contributions to renovate and paint the lighthouse. * The tower is regularly open during the summer for climbing by the public (for a small fee to cover insurance costs). The museum is open to the public, and is supported by donations. * On the grounds is the Old Bailey School, a 1907 One- room school house, which was moved there from Mikado, Michigan in 1998. * A strawberry social is held at the Bailey School on the last Sunday of June (adjacent to the lighthouse) to raise funds for the Alcona Historical Society. * The annual Sturgeon Point Light Station Sanctuary Bay sail boat race, which also has a local picnic, is also a fundraiser for the Alcona County Historical Society. It is regularly held on the first Saturday in August, and is a handicapped race for day sailors of all classes. The course is two times around a triangular 6 mile (9.2 kilometer) course in Sanctuary Bay, the area between Sturgeon Point Light and Alcona. * Michigan is the only state that supports lighthouse preservation with a program that includes annual grants from the state to local preservation groups. Consequently, there are many organizations and their volunteers working hard to save and restore lighthouses. The Michigan Lighthouse Conservancy is a state preservation society, and the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association is based in the state. The Alcona County Historical Society is in the process of collecting $70,000.00 for renovation (particularly brick work and painting) of its light, half of which is being funded by the state of Michigan.

He played college football at Winston-Salem State University. Early years Newsome attended Ahoskie High School, where he played safety and cornerback. He also played basketball and baseball. As a senior, he was named the team's most valuable player in football and basketball, as well as co-captain. He played in the North-South High School All-Star in 1976. College career Newsome accepted a football scholarship from Winston-Salem State University. As a freshman, he was converted into a running back. As a sophomore in 1977, he rushed for 998 yards and 14 touchdowns. The next season, he posted 1,377 rushing yards (second in Division II), a 7.5-yard average and 14 touchdowns. As a senior, he tallied 987 rushing yards and 9 touchdowns. The 1977 and 1978 football teams, which were coached by Bill Hayes, were two of the best teams in school history. They went undefeated each season and were led by Newsome and fellow running backs Arrington Jones and Randy Bolton, employing the Veer offense. Those Rams teams dominated their competition. In 1977, they went 11-0 but bypassed the Division II playoffs to play in the Gold Bowl in Richmond, Va. where they lost to South Carolina State University 10-7. In 1978, they went 11-0 again, won their first playoff game (17-0 over California State Poly) and then lost to Delaware State University 41-0 in the second round. In his last 3 seasons, he was the ClAA's leading rusher and scorer. He finished his college career as the leading rusher in school history with 3,843 yards (6.1-yard average) and 38 touchdowns. He also was one of the leading All-time rushers in the history of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA). In 1978 and 1979 he was named to the Sheridan All America Black College Football Team and was the Black College Football Offensive Player of the Year (1978). In 1993, he was inducted into the CIAA Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Winston-Salem State University Athletic Hall Of Fame. In 2019, he was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame. Professional career Newsome was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (162nd overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft. He made the roster by beating out Scott Laidlaw. Because the team already had Tony Dorsett as the starter at running back, as a rookie he was moved to fullback. He had 2 touchdowns against the San Diego Chargers. In 1981, he suffered a severe hamstring pull on the first day of training camp, which limited his chances competing for the starting fullback job against Ron Springs. After two seasons of struggles, he was moved back to running back in 1982. In a 24‚Äì10 win against the Washington Redskins he had an 18-yard touchdown run. In the 37‚Äì7 win against the Houston Oilers, he had a 43-yard reception and a 46-yard touchdown reception. In the 37‚Äì26 playoff win against the Green Bay Packers, he had 7 receptions for 70 yards and a two-yard touchdown run, while sharing fullback duties with Robert Newhouse in place of an injured Springs. In 1983, he registered 185 rushing yards, 250 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns. In the 27‚Äì24 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he turned a short pass into a 52-yard touchdown to send the game into overtime with 47 seconds left. In 1984, he started at fullback in the last 4 games of the season. In 1985, he started 14 games (missed 2 with injuries) at fullback after Springs was released. He had 88 carries for 252 yards, 46 receptions (tied for fourth on the team) for 361 yards (fifth on the team) and 3 touchdowns. In 1986, he started 12 games at fullback, until making way for Herschel Walker to start alongside Dorsett late in the year. He teamed with Dorsett and Walker to form Tom Landry's latest offensive innovation - the full-house backfield. He also served as the third tight end. He finished with 48 receptions (third on the team) for 421 yards (fourth on the team), 34 carries for 110 yards and 5 touchdowns. In 1987, he started 8 games at fullback, after Walker was given the team's main running back role. In a 17‚Äì27 loss against the Detroit Lions, he rushed for 2 touchdowns. In the 14‚Äì20 loss against the Miami Dolphins, he had 2 receptions for touchdowns. In 1988, he had a promising start, but suffered a season-ending calf injury in a practice following the ninth game of the season. Through the first half, he led the team in rushing touchdowns with 3 and was on a pace for a career-high 53 receptions. He also moved into ninth place on the Cowboys All-time receiving list with 212 receptions. In 1989, with the arrival of new head coach Jimmy Johnson, he was released as part of a youth movement on August 30. He spent most of his 9 seasons as a blocker and receiver out of the backfield, behind Cowboys legends Dorsett and Walker. He rushed for 1,226 yards with 19 rushing touchdowns and had 1,966 receiving yards with 11 receiving touchdowns. During his career he became an all-purpose utility back, playing also snaps at tight end. In 1990, he was selected to the Dallas Cowboys all-decade team by the Dallas Cowboys Weekly Newspaper.

The Durbar festival is an annual religious and equestrian celebration in several cities of Nigeria including Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, Zazzau, Bauchi and Bida. The festival marks the end of Ramadan and also coincides with the Muslim festivities of Eid al- Adha and Eid al-Fitri. It begins with prayers, followed by a colourful parade of the Emir and his entourage on horses, accompanied by musicians, and ending at the Emir's palace. Durbar festivals are organised in almost all cities of northern Nigeria and has become a major tourist attraction. In Northern Nigeria, the practices dates back over 200 years.  Etymology  The word Durbar is of Persian origin and it was first linked to ceremonial assemblies marking the proclamation of Queen Victoria as the Empress of colonial India in 1877. But the native Hausa use the term \\"Hawan Sallah\\" to describe the festival - with Hawan meaning the \\"Mount of Eid\\", referencing the physical mounting of the horse. History= Pre-colonial era = Historians say the \\"Hawan Daushe\\" (Mount of Daushe) was introduced to Kano during the reign of Muhammadu Rumfa in the 1400s. During and after the Fulani Jihad horses were used in warfare to protect the Emirate. Each noble household was expected to defend the Emirate by forming a regiment. Once a year, the regiments would gather for a military parade to demonstrate allegiance to their ruler, by showcasing their horsemanship, readiness for war, and loyalty. = Colonial era = Other say the Durbar festival was introduced to Nigeria by colonial administrators with political objectives in mind. The word Durbar is of Persian origin and it was first linked to ceremonial assemblies marking the proclamation of Queen Victoria as the Empress of colonial India in 1877. In Nigeria, the events then were ceremonial in nature, the first Durbar was held in 1911, subsequent ceremonies were held in 1924, 1925, 1948, 1960 and 1972. The ceremonies linked together pre-colonial aspects of martial display, colonist created assemblies and celebrations of important events in Northern Nigeria. =Independence= The Durbar festival featured prominently in the 2nd World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture sometimes known as Festac 77. Since Festac, the colonial origins was gradually phased out and the events were linked with pre-colonial traditions such as the importance of horses for military purposes and ceremonies in the Bornu Empire and the ceremonies of 'Hawan Sallah' and 'Hawan Idi'.

Phil tells the Lupertazzi crime family that he is ready to settle down and \\"enjoy [his] grandchildren.\\" A flashback to the episode \\"All Due Respect\\" shows Tony Soprano fleeing when Johnny Sack is arrested by the FBI. A teenage boy sees Tony throw a pistol into the snow and retrieves the gun. In the current episode, the boy is arrested on a drug charge and the gun is found in his possession, with hollow- point bullets in it. Essex County Sheriffs ostentatiously arrest Tony on a gun charge based on the boy's testimony. He is briefly jailed but his attorney, Neil Mink, easily secures his release on bail. The gun charge is soon dropped, and no longer hangs over his approaching birthday weekend. The FBI later includes this charge in building a RICO case against Tony . Tony and Carmela travel to Janice and Bobby's upstate New York cabin to celebrate Tony's birthday. Tony and Bobby bond as they fire a customized Armalite AR-10 A4C Carbine assault rifle, Bobby's birthday present to Tony, in the nearby woods. Tony gives Bobby a major new responsibility in the Soprano crime family and hints at a still higher position. Bobby muses how suddenly and silently death can happen in their lives as gangsters: \\"You probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?\\" Tony comments that Bobby has never \\"popped his cherry\\" (never killed anyone) in contrast with Bobby's father. Bobby replies that he has come close, but that his father never wanted it for him. Carmela phones A.J.; he answers the phone, not at the pizzeria where he is now working, but in his parents' bed with Blanca. A group of their friends also come for a party. After dinner Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice play Monopoly, arguing about house rules, drinking, and joking. Tony is angry with Janice when she tells a story that discredits their father. He makes a crude joke about her, apologizes, but then makes another. Bobby punches Tony hard in the head. There is a messy and ferocious fight, ending with Tony on the floor, bloodied, unable to rise. Panicking, Bobby tries to drive off drunk and backs into a tree. He returns and apologizes. In the morning, Tony and Carmela are persuaded to stay, but Tony fixates on his loss in the fight. In the afternoon the women apprehensively watch Tony and Bobby leave, ostensibly for a game of golf, in fact for a meeting with two Qu√©b√©cois. In exchange for a large amount of expired prescription medication at a heavy discount, Tony agrees to a hit on the brother-in-law of one of the Qu√©b√©cois and asks Bobby to personally take care of it. Bobby is compelled to accept. They return to the house and Carmela and Tony leave for home. Bobby immediately sets off for Montreal for the hit; he kills the man at point-blank range. He returns to his lakefront house, picks up his daughter and hugs her. Back home, Tony watches a \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" DVD given to him by Janice as a birthday present: it shows himself and Janice, children playing. First appearance * Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro: a veteran made man, very likely a capo, of the Lupertazzi crime family, one of the mobsters who welcomes Phil Leotardo back from the hospital. Deceased * Ren√© LeCours: shot dead by Bobby Baccalieri in Montreal on orders from Tony Soprano in exchange for $35,000 off the drug prices negotiated with French Canadian gangsters. Title reference * Janice's birthday present to Tony is a DVD of old home movies of them and their sister during their childhood. Production=Writing= \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" was written by four of the show's five principal season six writers: supervising producers and writing team Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider, series creator and showrunner David Chase and executive producer Matthew Weiner, who had been promoted from co-executive producer before the production of \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" began. The four developed the episode's story outline along with executive producer Terence Winter. \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" is Frolov and Schneider's fourth and final official writing credit for the series; it is Chase's twenty-seventh and Weiner's ninth. Chase and Weiner collaborated on two more of the season's episodes: \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\" and \\"The Blue Comet.\\" =Filming= \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" was the first episode of the final nine episodes to be produced, following a six-month-long production hiatus. In preparation for shooting the episode, series creator/executive producer David Chase held several rehearsals with the lead actors. The scenes at the lakefront vacation home were filmed over two weeks in June 2006 in Putnam Valley, New York. Additional interior shots were filmed six months later at Silvercup Studios, New York, where a replica of the cabin had been built in a sound stage. The lake seen multiple times in the episode is Lake Oscawana. The scenes of Tony and Bobby fishing were filmed on location on the lake but much closer to the shore than it appears in the episode. The scenes set in Montreal were actually filmed in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Filming of the scenes set in New Jersey and the Soprano residence took place on location in Essex County, New Jersey, and in Silvercup Studios. While filming the cabin fight scene between Tony and Bobby in Silvercup Studios, Steve Schirripa accidentally headbutted James Gandolfini. The fight scene was choreographed but Gandolfini didn't step out of the way in time. His nose was bloodied but not broken. The real headbutting was kept in the episode. =Cast notes= * Gregory Antonacci, who plays Phil Leotardo's underboss Butch DeConcini on the show, is promoted to the main cast and billed in the opening credits, but only for this episode. * Dominic Chianese's son Dominic Chianese, Jr. joins the show as a mostly background character, New York mobster Dominic, one of the members of the Lupertazzi crime family who greets Phil upon his return from the hospital. * The role of Domenica Baccalieri was recast with twins Avery Elaine and Emily Ruth Pulcher replacing Kimberly and Brianna Laughlin. References to previous episodes * The 2004 winter scene of Johnny \\"Sack\\"'s arrest is taken from the season 5 finale \\"All Due Respect.\\" * Carmela mentions the house on the shore she and Tony once wanted to buy and Tony, irritated, changes the subject. Carmela refers to Whitecaps, the house on the Jersey Shore featured in the season four finale named after it whose purchase was abandoned right after Tony and Carmela's separation. * Janice describes to Carmela her previous boyfriend who once hit her and she \\"exploded\\" in anger against him, referring to the murder of Richie Aprile in the season two episode \\"The Knight in White Satin Armor.\\" * Carmela mentions to Janice on the lake that Tony slapped A.J. and added that he \\"felt horrible after it for days\\" in the season three finale \\"Army of One.\\" Other cultural and historical references * Doc Santoro sings the opening line from \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" when he sees Phil Leotardo at his party. * When Tony sees Bobby wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt at the lake house, Tony exclaims \\"National Lampoon's Vacation!\\" in reference to the 1983 movie starring Chevy Chase. * When Janice tells Tony he has changed and is \\"different\\" since the shooting, Tony responds: \\"Different how? How am I different?\\" a throwback to Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito in the famous Goodfellas scene: \\"Funny how?

Reception=Ratings= \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" drew an average of 7.66 million viewers when it first aired on HBO on Sunday, April 8, 2007, in the United States. This estimate was done by Nielsen Ratings. This was a significant drop from the 2006 season premiere episode, \\"Members Only\\", which attracted 9.47 million viewers and the lowest ratings for a Sopranos premiere since the season two opening episode, \\"Guy Walks Into a Psychiatrist's Office...\\", which drew roughly the same number of viewers as \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" (7.64 million viewers). =Critical response= The episode was critically acclaimed. Tom Biro of television webblog TV Squad gave the episode a favorable review, writing \\"All in all, big thumbs up from me.\\" Marisa Carroll of PopMatters called the midseason premiere \\"stellar\\" and wrote that \\"David Chase repeatedly re-imagines ordinary family scenarios‚Äîlike a weekend trip to the mountains‚Äîin brutal, gangster terms. [...] Such signature exaggerations remain both hilarious and unsettling.\\" She awarded the episode a score of 9 out of 10 (shared with the following two episodes). Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the episode, writing \\"the series remains as vital and interesting as ever [...] There may be no better (or realistic) way to go forward into this Sopranos swan song.\\" Kim Reed of Television Without Pity gave the midseason premiere an A‚àí, writing \\"...while, on the surface, not much happened, I think there were a ton of callbacks to previous episodes and that familiar Soprano tension was used to good effect.\\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wrote \\"this is loose, contemplative Sopranos storytelling at its best.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the midseason premiere and wrote that, despite not being a very eventful episode on the surface, \\"everything happened\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger gave \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" a positive review and praised it for featuring the character of Bobby Bacala in a more prominent role, writing \\"The hour was largely a refresher course on Tony, Janice and their history, but it also gave Bacala the dignity he's so often been deprived by the writers.\\" Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times gave the episode a mixed review, calling it \\"solemn\\" and wrote that \\"even before last season the series had started to sag in places, a creative fatigue that matched the main characters' weariness and also the audience's.\\" Brian Zoromski of IGN awarded \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" a score of 9.5 out of 10, citing the calm, subtle storytelling as a great strength. =Awards= In 2007, \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" was nominated in four categories for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. The episode was submitted for consideration in the category of Outstanding Drama Series. This led to a nomination and the show‚Äîwhich was judged by six episodes from the second part of the sixth season, including \\"Soprano Home Movies\\"‚Äîwon. It was also nominated but failed to win in the categories of Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (Phil Abraham), Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (William B. Stich), and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Aida Turturro). The episode was also submitted for Emmy consideration in the categories of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (Steve Schirripa) and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (David Chase, Diane Frolov, Andrew Schneider, and Matthew Weiner); however, it was not nominated. In 2008, Tim Van Patten was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Drama Series, but lost out to Mad Men's Alan Taylor, also a director for The Sopranos, who happened to win the Emmy Award for directing \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\" at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Active in the 1930s in organising the Saigon waterfront, industry and transport, Trotskyists presented a significant challenge to the Moscow-aligned party in Cochinchina. Following the September 1945 Saigon uprising against the restoration of the French, Vietnamese Trotskyists were systematically hunted down and eliminated by both the French S√ªret√© and the Communist-front Viet Minh. The Emergence of Left Opposition An identifiable Trotskyist tendency among Vietnamese revolutionary circles emerges first in Paris among the student youth of the Annamite Independence Party.Robert J. Alexander, Vietnamese Trotskyism (https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/alex/works/in_trot/viet.htm). Retrieved 10 October 2019 Following the bloody suppression of the Y√™n B√°i mutiny, their leader T·∫° Thu Th√¢u expressed their view of the revolution in Indochina in the pages of the Left Opposition La Verit√© (May and June issues, 1930). The revolution would not follow the precedent the Third International had set in supporting the Kuomintang in China. A commitment to a broad nationalist front (\\"Sun Yat-sen ism\\") would betray the revolutionary interests of the anti-colonial struggle. For the colonised the choice was no longer between independence and slavery, but between socialism and nationalism. As \\"the social enemy of imperialism.\\" the worker and peasant masses would free themselves from oppression under the French overseer only through their own organised action. \\"Independence is inseparable from proletarian revolution.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn,In the Crossfire: Adventures of a Vietnamese Revolutionary. AK Press, Oakland CA, 2010, p. 159-160 For organising protests against the execution of Y√™n B√°i insurgent leaders, in May 1930 T·∫° Thu Th√¢u and eighteen of his compatriots were arrested and deported back to Cochinchina. In Saigon the deportees found several groups of militants open to the theses of Left Opposition, some within the PCI. In November 1931 dissidents emerging from within the Party formed the October Left Opposition (Ta Doi Lap Thang Moui) around the clandestine journal Thang Muoi (October). These included H·ªì H·ªØu T∆∞·ªùng, Dao Hung Long (alias Anh Gia ), and Phan VƒÉn H√πm.

Between 1930 and the end of 1932, more than 12,000 political prisoners were taken in Cochinchina, of whom 7,000 were sent to the penal colonies. The structures of the Party and of the Left Opposition alike were shattered.VƒÉn, In the Crossroads pp. 54-55 The Struggle and the Internationalist League La Lutte 23 February 1935.

In 1933, several factional representatives, including T·∫° Thu Th√¢u, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·∫°o of the PCI [later to be labour minister in Hanoi]Archimedes L. A. Patti, Why Viet Nam?: Prelude to America's Albatross, University of California Press, 1982, p. 494 and the anarchist Trinh Hung Ngau, regrouped around charismatic figure of Nguy·ªÖn An Ninh, and took the initiative of legally opposing the colonial regime in the Saigon municipal elections of April-May 1933. They put forward a common \\"Workers's List\\" and briefly published a newspaper (in French to get around the political restrictions on Vietnamese), La Lutte (The Struggle) to rally support for it. In spite of the restricted franchise, two of this Struggle group were elected (although denied their seats), the independent (later Trotskyist) Tran Van Thach and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·∫°o. In 1934 the La Lutte the collaboration was revived on the basis of a formal Party- Oppositionist entente: \\"struggle oriented against the colonial power and its constitutionalist allies, support of the demands of workers and peasants without regard to which of the two groups they were affiliated with, diffusion of classic Marxist thought, [and] rejection of all attacks against the USSR and against either current.\\"Daniel Hemery Revolutionnaires Vietnamiens et pouvoir colonial en Indochine. Fran√ßois Maspero, Paris. 1975, p. 63 In the March 1935 Cochinchina Colonial Council election candidates supported by La Lutte obtained 17% of the votes, although none were elected. Two months later in the Saigon municipal elections four of six candidates on a joint \\"Workers's Slate,\\" including T·∫° Thu Th√¢u and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·∫°o, were elected, although only Tran Van Thach as the ostensible non-communist was allowed his seat.K.

After Le Militant was suppressed, from January 1939 the League/the Octobrists began clandestinely publishing Tia Sang (The Spark). The title, The Spark, may have been a reference to Tia Sang (the Spark) group in Hanoi, and suggests an organisational connection. In 1937-38, this northern group had put out a weekly, Thoi Dam (Chronicles), with a call to workers and peasants to set up \\"unified people's committees in the struggle for rice, freedom and democracy.\\"Van, In the Crossfire, p. 173. Octobrists are reported to have been active in labour organising in Hanoi, Haiphong and Vinh.Patti, Why Viet Nam?, p. 522 In Saigon, with a renewed upsurge culminating in the summer of 1937 in general dock and transport strikes, the tide on the left seemed to be running in favour of the Trotskyists.

T·∫° Thu Th√¢u and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·∫°o came together for the last time in the April 1937 city council elections, both being elected. Together with the lengthening shadow of the Moscow Trials (obliging the Party loyalists to denounce their erstwhile colleagues as \\"the twin brothers of fascism\\"), growing disagreement over the new PCF-supported Popular Front government in France ensured a split.Frank N. Trager (ed.). Marxism in Southeast Asia; A Study of Four Countries. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1959. p. 142. The leftward shift in the French national Assembly in Th√¢u's view had not brought meaningful change. He and his comrades continued to be arrested during labour strikes, and preparations for a popular congress in response to the government's promise of colonial consultation had been suppressed. Colonial Minister Marius Moutet, a Socialist commented that he had sought \\"a wide consultation with all elements of the popular [will],\\" but with \\"Trotskyist-Communists intervening in the villages to menace and intimidate the peasant part of the population, taking all authority from the public officials,\\" the necessary \\"formula\\" had not been found.Hemery Revolutionnaires Vietnamiens, p. 388 Th√¢u's motion attacking the Popular Front for betraying the promises of reforms in the colonies was rejected by the PCI faction and in June 1937 the Stalinists withdrew from La Lutte>VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 161 The Workers vs. the Democratic Platform In April 1939, together with the Octobrists, the now wholly Trotskyist La Lutte group celebrated what a reviewer of Ng√¥ VƒÉn's later accountNgo Van, Viet-nam 1920-1945: R√©volution et contre-r√©volution sous la domination coloniale, Paris: Nautilus Editions, 2000 describes as \\"the only instance prior to 1945 in which the politics of 'permanent revolution' oriented to worker and peasant opposition to colonialism won out, however ephemerally, against Stalinist 'stage theory' in a public arena.\\"Loren Goldner, \\"The Anti-Colonial Movement in Vietnam\\". New Politics, Vol VI, No. 3, 1997, pp. 135‚Äì141. In elections to the colonial Cochinchina Council a \\"United Workers and Peasants\\" slate, led by T·∫° Thu Th√¢u, triumphed over both the Communist Party's Democratic Front and the \\"bourgeois\\" Constitutionalists with fully 80 per cent of the vote. Revolutionary theory had not been the issue for the income-tax-payer electorate. Rather it had been the colonial defence levy that the PCI, in the spirit of Franco-Soviet accord, had felt obliged to support. Nonetheless the contest illustrated the ideological gulf between the Party and the left opposition. The Workers and Peasants platform had been revolutionary (calls for workers control and radical land re-distribution) and reflected the analysis T·∫° Thu Th√¢u had outlined in La Verit√©. The \\"real, organic liaison between the indigenous bourgeoisie and French imperialism\\" was such that the organisation of \\"the proletarian and peasant masses\\" was the only force capable of liberating the country. The question of independence was \\"bound up with that of the proletarian socialist revolution.\\"Ngo Van Xuyet, Ta Thu Thau: Vietnamese Trotskyist Leader, https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/backiss/vol3/no2/thau.html The Democratic platform, with its calls for national unity and relatively modest demands for constitutional change, was presented by a party whose leading cadres \\"emphasised much more the exterior development of capitalism\\", \\"used the word 'imperialism' much more often in their discussions,\\" talked about ‚Äúnonequivalent exchange,‚Äù and of \\"the continuing feudal nature of Vietnamese society.\\"H√©mery, R√©volutionaires vietnamiens, pp. 46-47 It was a party for whom the immediate object of anti-colonial struggle was national, not socialist. At the same time, the Democratic platform had represented a party with a much greater national organisation and presence. The Trotskyists were concentrated in industrial and commercial centres, and in French direct-rule Cochinchina, where it possible to have a keener sense of proximities to France. (Ho Huu Thuong's vision was of a revolutionary general strike coordinated with the French proletariat).Van, In the Crossfire, p. 168 The greater resilience of the PCI--their ability to regroup and rebuild in the face of repression--was due to its organisation in the countryside and across Annam (central Vietnam) and Tonkin in the North. In these \\"protectorates\\" the French, under the titular authority of the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i had retained traditional elements of rural administration. Their rule had the calculated appearance of being external to a still extant indigenous culture, and allowed greater play to the idea of a national society that might be mobilised against the foreign overseer.Wiliam J. Duiker: The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam, Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, 1981. Such as it was, the political opening against the Communist Party closed with the Hitler-Stalin Pact of August 23, 1939. Moscow ordered a return to direct confrontation with the French. In Cochinchina the Party obliged with a disastrous peasant revolt. Belatedly, the Luttuers, then numbering then perhaps 3000,AWL, The forgotten massacre of the Vietnamese Trotskyists.https://www.workersliberty.org/story/2005/09/12/forgotten- massacre-vietnamese-trotskyists and the smaller number of Octobrists united as the official section of the newly constituted Fourth International. They formed the International Communist League (Vietnam) (ICL), or less formally as The Fourth Internationalist Party (Trang Cau De Tu Dang).Patti, Why Viet Nam?\\", pp. 522-523 But the French law of September 26, 1939, which legally dissolved the French Communist Party, was applied in Indochina to Stalinists and Trotskyists aiike. The Indochinese Communist Party and the Fourth Internationalists were driven underground for the duration of the war. The North and the H√≤n Gai-C·∫©m Ph·∫£ \\"Commune\\" Opportunity for open political struggle returned with the formal surrender of the occupying Japanese in August 1945. But events then moved rapidly to demonstrate the Trotskyists' relative isolation. There was little intimacy with developments to the north where, in Hanoi on September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh and his a new Front for the Independence of Vietnam, the Viet Minh, proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The lack of connection was made \\"painfully clear\\" when Ng√¥ VƒÉn and his comrades found they had \\"no way of finding out what was happening\\" following reports that in the H√≤n Gai-C·∫©m Ph·∫£ coal region north of Haiphong 30,000 workers had elected councils to run mines, public services and transport, and were applying the principle of equal wages for all types of work, whether manual or intellectual.Van, In the Crossfire, pp.120-121McDowell, \\"Sky without Light\\", p. 133 Later they were to learn that, after three months of revolutionary autonomy, the commune had been forcibly integrated into \\"the military-police structure\\" of the new republic.Ngo Van Xuyet [Ngo Van], A Hundred Year War, https://libcom.org/history/hundred-year- war-ngo-van-xuyet Released from detention in 1944, in April 1945 T·∫° Thu Thau and a small band had travelled to the (famine-stricken) North. They were introduced to clandestine meetings of mine workers and peasants by a \\"fraternal group\\" publishing the bulletin in Hanoi Chi·∫øn ƒê·∫•u (Combat). This was the rump of the ICL in the north, many of their comrades having chosen to join the Viet Minh. Now styling themselves the Socialist Workers Party of Northern Vietnam (Dang Tho Thuyen Xa Hoi Viet Bac), their call, as in the South, was for workers' control, land redistribution and for armed resistance to a return of the French. Whether they, or other Trotskyist groups, played any role in the Hongai-Camphai events is unclear. On Ho Chi Minh's orders they were already being rounded up and executed.VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 162, pp. 178-179 Hunted and pursued south by the Viet Minh, T·∫° Thu Th√¢u was captured in early September at Quang Ngai. A year later in Paris, the French socialist Daniel Guerin recalls that when he asked Ho Chi Minh about T·∫° Thu Th√¢u's fate, Ho replied, \\"with unfeigned emotion,‚Äú that \\"'Th√¢u was a great patriot and we mourn him.\\" But he then added, \\"in a steady voice, 'all those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.'‚ÄùDaniel Guerin, Aux services des colonises, 1930-1953, Editions Minuit, Paris, 1954 p. 22 The September 1945 Saigon Uprising On August 24 the Viet Minh declared a provisional administration, a Southern Administrative Committee, in Saigon. When, for the declared purpose of disarming the Japanese, the Viet-Minh accommodated the landing and strategic positioning of their wartime \\"democratic allies\\", the British, rival political groups turned out in force. On September 7 and 8, 1945, in the delta city of C·∫ßn Th∆° the Committee had to rely on what had been the Japanese-auxiliary, Jeunesse d'Avant-Garde/Thanh Nien Tienphong [Vanguard Youth]. They fired upon crowds, joined by the ICL, demanding arms against the French. In Saigon, the brutality of a French restoration, under the protection of British guns, triggered a general uprising on September 23. Under the slogan \\"Land to the Peasants! Factories to the workers!,\\" the ICL called on the population to arm themselves and organise in councils. To co-ordinate these efforts the Internationalists established a Popular Revolutionary Committee, an \\"embryonic soviet that placed its stamp upon the region of Saigon-Cholon, Gia-dinh and Bien-Hoa.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, A ‚ÄòMoscow Trial‚Äô in Ho Chi Minh‚Äôs Guerilla Movement. https://libcom.org/library/%E2%80%98moscow-trial%E2%80%99-ho-chi- minh%E2%80%99s-guerilla-movement Delegates issued \\"a declaration in which they affirmed their independence from the political parties and resolutely condemned any attempt to restrict the autonomy of the decisions taken by workers and peasants.\\"VƒÉn, In the Crossfire p. 125 With other League comrades, Ng√¥ VƒÉn joined in arms with streetcar workers.

In 1946, as many as 500 exiles were reported to be members of the Groupe Communiste Internationaliste de Vietnam (GCI ‚Äî Internationalist Communist Group of Vietnam). They published a paper titled, in the tradition of La Lutte, Tranh Dau (Struggle).Stalinism and Trotskyism in Vietnam, Spartacist Publishing Co., New York, 1976, p. 49 In what, presumably, was a still smaller exile publication, Thieng Tho (Workers' Voice), Ng√¥ VƒÉn wrote an opinion piece under the name Dong Vu (October 30, 1951) \\"Prol√©taires et paysans, retournez vos fusils!\\" [Workers and Peasants, Turn Your Guns in the Other Direction!]. If Ho Chi Minh won out over the French-puppet B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government, workers and peasants would simply have changed masters. Those with guns in their hands should fight for their own emancipation, following the example of the Russian workers, peasants and soldiers who formed soviets in 1917, or the German worker's and soldiers' councils of 1918-1919.VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 200 But this clearly, was a minority position. In line with continued defence of the Soviet Union by Trotskyists internationally as a \\"(degenerated) workers' state,\\" Vietnamese Trotskyists muted their criticism of the Viet Minh regime. The slogan, adopted as Ng√¥ VƒÉn noted \\"despite the assassination of almost all their comrades in Vietnam by Ho Chi Minh's hired thugs,\\" was \\"Defend the government of Ho Chi Minh against the attacks of imperialism.\\"VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 199 As the Indochinese war intensified in the late 1940s, the French government began massive deportations of Vietnamese, including about three-quarters of the Trotskyists. The latter \\"simply disappeared after their return to Vietnam, presumably through capitulation to the Viet Minh Stalinists or liquidation by either the Stalinists or the French.\\" By 1951-52 there were only about 70 Vietnamese ostensible Trotskyists left in France. La Lutte and League supporters combined in the Bolshevik-Leninist Group of Vietnam (BLGV). This continued to exist, at least in some form, until as late as 1974.Stalinism and Trotskyism in Vietnam, pp. 50-54 By the early 1980s the history of the Vietnamese Trotskyist movement, which in the 1930s may been the most important expression of left opposition in Asia (possibly greater in its scope than in China and in advance of its emergence in IndiaAlexander, International Trotskyism 1929-1985), had been \\"all but forgotten by the Trotskyists themselves.\\" Robert Alexander suggests two reasons for this.Alexander, Vietnamese Trotskyism First, there was \\"the very thoroughness of the Stalinist extermination of the Trotskyist leadership in Vietnam.\\" This \\"left no outstanding figure of the movement alive to tell about it outside the country, and to continue to be active in one or another faction of the international Trotskyist movement.\\" Ng√¥ VƒÉn is probably the most commonly cited witness to the story. But VƒÉn's memoirs are prefaced with a repudiation of \\"Bolshevism-Leninism-Trotskyism.\\" In France, experiences shared with refugees from Spanish Civil War, anarchists and veterans of the POUM (The Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), \\"permanently distanced\\" VƒÉn from the politics of \\"so-called 'workers' parties.\\"VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 2 The second reason, however, is precisely that which Ng√¥ VƒÉn underscored in his Thieng Tho article (and in his later memorials for fallen friends and comrades). It is what Robert Alexander recounts as \\"the passion, effort and attention paid by Trotskyists of virtually all countries and all factions to support of the Stalinist side during the long and cruel Vietnam War, which in one form or another went on for thirty years, from 1945 to 1975. With such strong commitment to the 'degenerated workers state' of Ho Chi Minh and his successors any memories of what he had done to fellow Trotskyists had to be at least a source of discomfort if not outright embarrassment to the world Trotskyist movement.\\" ReferencesSee also *International Communist League (Vietnam) * La Lutte *Ngo Van *Ta Thu Thau External Links *Robert J.

Such agreements allow passengers to change from one flight on one airline to another flight on another airline without having to gather their bags or check-in again. Airlines can also promise free rebooking if the connection is lost due to a delay. Interlining agreements differ from codeshare agreements in that codeshare agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline's code (abbreviation) even though the flight is operated by another airline. However, codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket (or e-ticket) can be issued, since both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare operating carrier must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued. Interline agreements are directional. For example, it may be possible for American Airlines to issue the ticket on an American- United itinerary, but United might not be able to be issuer on the same itinerary. Such a one-directional interline agreement is called a unilateral interline. The airlines may also agree to enter a bilateral interline agreement, where each airline can issue the ticket on the other airline. Previously, only large network carriers such as United Airlines and Lufthansa would have electronic ticket interline agreements, but the IATA mandate to eliminate paper tickets at the end of 2007 has changed this by forcing smaller carriers to implement electronic ticketing. Smaller legacy carriers commonly have interline agreements with large network carriers that fly into their markets. Most newer low-cost airlines that only sell directly to consumers (and not through agencies or Global distribution systems) do not support interlining at all. If no interline ticketing agreement exists, then two separate tickets will need to be issued, and passengers will have to retrieve their bags and carry it to the connecting airline for check-in. Itineraries with interline connections such as this are riskier for travelers, since the second carrier may be unaware of delays or issues with the incoming flight and is less likely to permit a rebooking without cost if the connection is lost. There can also be a problem if luggage is lost and the traveler wants it to be sent to them later. Most online travel agencies will only display itineraries that can be ticketed on one of their booking systems. However, Orbitz will sometimes display un-ticketable interline itineraries. Examples could be found previously on routes to Mexico involving the now defunct Aero California, or may be currently found on routes to Indonesia involving Lion Air. These are displayed on Orbitz as \\"contact airline to buy\\". Participating airlines Carriers that participate in airline alliances such as Star Alliance, SkyTeam or oneworld almost always have interline agreements with one another. However, even direct competitors can benefit from interline agreements. When a ticket is issued for an interline itinerary, one of the airlines in that itinerary will be selected by the ticketing agent as the issuing airline, commonly referred to as the \\"plating carrier.\\" The plating carrier collects the entire fare from the customer, either via own sales channels (e.g., web site or ticket office), or via travel agents. Travel agents remit collected fares and taxes to the plating carrier via Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) in the US, or Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) in rest of the world. The airline which actually carried the passenger (the operating airline) will send an invoice to the issuing/plating carrier, normally via IATA Clearing House, to collect its portion of the fare and taxes. The operating airline is responsible for remitting passenger taxes to the various governments and airports. Some taxes are sales based (US taxes), and shall be remitted by the issuing airline. Only the issuing carrier is responsible for paying commission to the agency. The amount of commission is based on the entire air fare, but the percentage amount varies from the amount paid if only a single airline was involved. Normal fare construction rules state that an international ticket issued should be issued by the first international carrier. There are some exceptions, such as if the first international is a codeshare flight, when the first non-codeshare would be used, or if an airline does not have an office in the country of origin References Category:Civil aviation Category:Scheduling (transportation) Category:Transport operations ","title":"Interlining"},{"id":"10401552","text":"Strongylus vulgaris (large strongyles), commonly known as the blood worm,Disease Information. 2001. \\"Merial\\" http://nz.merial.com/horse_owners/disease/strongy_lg.html is a common horse parasite in the phylum Nematoda. It looks like a long worm with a large biting mouth. They are usually reddish in color because of all the blood they take from the equine host. This nematode is considered to be one of the \\"most pathogenic\\" of the large strongyles subphylum and is distributed worldwide, wherever there are grassland and temperate environments.De Ley, P. & Blaxter, M. \\"Systematic Position and Phylogeny.\\" The Biology of Nematodes. Lee D. L. (Ed.). London & New York: Taylor & Francis, 2002. 1-30. Background Information During the infective stage of the S. Vulgaris life cycle, the larvae that have matured in the intestinal tract of the horse will migrate into the surrounding blood vessels. Once in the blood vessels, the larvae will continue their migration throughout the body to various organs causing damage to the blood vessels along the way. This can cause anemia or blockage of blood flow caused by the detachment of blood clots from the vessel wall resulting in tissue death. S. Vulgaris are commonly found in pastures and stalls where feces are present. The larvae crawl up on the grass which is where they are then eaten by the horse. Harsh environments do not kill S. Vulgaris, such as freezing. https://horses.extension.org/strongyles-in-horses  Clinical Signs  Symptoms can range depending on how severe the infection is. In mild cases the most common clinical signs are weightless, compromised performance, and a dull hair coat.https://www.vetfolio.com/learn/article/equine-strongylosis Other clinical signs can range from diarrhea, weakness, anorexia, anemia if there are significant blood loss and abdominal discomfort. Severe cases can show signs of having severe colic, rupture of the intestines, and death. These signs may also be observed with other equine-related infections or illnesses and their presence alone should not be used to diagnose an infection of S. Vulgaris. Contact your veterinarian if you suspect an S. Vulgaris infection for further diagnosis. Diagnosis Large strongyle infections are commonly diagnosed through the observations of fecal samples. These fecal samples can be viewed under a microscope to identify the eggs of S. vulgaris. Diagnosis via egg identification is not enough to determine if the horse has a S. vulgaris infection as the fecal samples often contain a mixture of large and small strongyle eggs that are very similar in appearance. The best diagnostic method to determine if a horse has a S. vulgaris infection is through a fecal culture. Here the eggs grow and develop into the infective larval stage that is specific to the large strongyle parasite.https://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/gastrointestinal- parasites-of-horses/large-strongyles-in-horses  Life Cycle  The S. vulgaris adults are primarily found in the cecum and colon of infected equids and it is here that the females will lay their eggs. These eggs will pass out of the horses body in the feces. Once outside the body the eggs will hatch and develop into the infective larval stage L3. The larvae enter the host when the horse grazes a patch of grass containing the larval stage. Back inside the host the infective larval stage migrates to the small intestine where it can enter the intestinal mucosa and further develop into the L4 stage. It is this stage that can enter the blood vessels and migrate throughout the body for a period of up to six months. During this time the L4 stage matures into the L5 or immature adult stage before returning to the intestinal wall. The L5 stage resides primarily in the cecum and colon where the males and females copulate thus starting the cycle over again.  Treatment  Dewormers that have ivermectin or moxidectin are the most effective against these parasites. Treating a horse with regular dewormer when they have the worms inside of them may cause the worms to migrate all at once, causing rupture of the intestines and lead to death. Recommendations for deworming horses include performing fecal egg counts to determine what kind of protection each individual horse requires and alternating products in the fall and spring. An example would be using ivermectin based products (Equell or Zimectrin) in the spring and moxidectin based products in combination with praziquantel (Quest Plus) in the fall or vice versa. http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/Documents/recommended- equine-deworming-schedule.pdf A deworming schedule should be discussed with a veterinarian.  Prevention  Horses are able to pick up this parasite from feces contaminated food and water. To avoid this, it is best to clean water tanks and pick out pastures often, avoid feeding on the ground, and avoid overstocking pastures.Large Strongyles, Equine. 2015. Veterinary Medical Clinic. http://www.vetmedclinic.com/?p=118 As foals can be extremely susceptible to this parasite, it is best to treat broodmares before they give birth and move them to uninfected pastures to avoid transfer.

Due to his status as Greek god of the sea, the character has figured primarily in stories relating to two of DC Comics' main superhero properties: Wonder Woman (an Amazon warrior with various connections to the Greek pantheon) and Aquaman (the king of the underwater city of Atlantis). Publication history Poseidon first appears in Flash Comics #9 and was adapted by George P√©rez. Fictional character biography Poseidon's history in Greek mythology is the same in the DC Comics universe, including the fact that he is the brother of Zeus and Hades. When the Amazons freed themselves from enslavement arranged in part by Ares, the founding Goddesses of that people received the help of Poseidon, who had a deep grievance against the war god, to get the Amazons to safety by parting the sea waters to create a path to the island of Themyscira. When Hawkman was fighting the undersea creatures called the Kogats, he received help from Poseidon who helped to destroy them.Flash Comics #9 With the help of Proteus, Poseidon sees into the future where he takes an interest in Mera and plans to make her his wife. Proteus provides Poseidon with ‚Äútime pods‚Äù that allow him to travel back and forth in time. When Poseidon abducts Mera, Aquaman steals one of the Olympian's time pods and follows him. Zeus proposes a contest to retrieve a golden apple beneath the sea, with Mera going to the winner. Despite Poseidon's cheating, Aquaman manages to win the contest. Angered, Poseidon takes Mera and flees to Aquaman's time. Aquaman and Aqualad follow with the help of Zeus and save both Mera and Poseidon from a berserk creature created by Mera. Poseidon vows to mend his ways, and Aquaman gives him a pod with which he can travel back to his normal era.Aquaman #17 After Ares was defeated by Wonder Woman, Poseidon was with the Gods when they rejoiced. With Wonder Woman dying from the wounds she sustained in her fight against Ares, Zeus orders Poseidon to take Wonder Woman underwater to heal her.Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #7 Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon meet atop the corpse of their father and revise their pact. They will join forces to build a new Olympus.Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #18 After Aquaman had defeated Poseidon's son Triton in combat, Poseidon decrees that the humiliation of a God is nothing that no mortal should ever play witness to. So as punishment, Poseidon blinds Aquaman.Aquaman Vol. 5 #34 Aquaman tells Poseidon to go to Hell, but Poseidon merely laughs at him and disappears.Aquaman Vol. 5 #35 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Poseidon is reintroduced when Wonder Woman arrives at the Thames River in order to gain an audience with him. Poseidon appears to Wonder Woman in the form of a massive, furry, tentacled frog. Poseidon senses Zeus' blood in Diana and warns her that her heritage has no meaning with Zeus' death, and demands that she step aside. Acknowledging Poseidon's claim to the heavens, Diana warns that Hera has already claimed them as her own. Poseidon is angered, lifting her up by the neck as citizens watch in horror from the bridge.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #5 Poseidon is skeptical that Hera hopes to gain control over all of Olympus. If it is true, he will make her kneel to him. The world was split between the three brothers - sea, heavens, and hell. The rest were scraps left to the other gods. Now, he has the power to destroy those scraps or leave them be. It will be up to the others to decide which they want. Without a king, he says, Hera has nothing. Wonder Woman is not making much progress with her bargain to Poseidon as he swats her up onto the London Bridge. When Lennox and Hades arrive at where Wonder Woman and Poseidon are, Wonder Woman makes her proposal: that Olympus could be ruled by the sea by day and the underworld by night...all while sharing a queen. Poseidon finds the deal laughable. Just then, the group is approached by Hera. Poseidon is amused by the fact that Hera played him and Hades as fools. Poseidon regards this as a mistake that will not be made again, swallowing the First Born whole.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #6 The First Born later confronts Poseidon who regrets Zeus' decision to let the First Born Live.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #18 Within the belly of Poseidon, the First Born and Cassandra find their way to Poseidon's true home where Poseidon offers him a deal. He will return the First Born's weapon and allow him to overtake Mount Olympus in exchange for leaving the sea and the Underworld to its current rulers. Naturally, the First Born refuses. Poseidon warns that if the First Born kills him there, he will forever be trapped within the god's corpse. As such, it behooves him to make a deal. The deal will be sealed in blood, and the First Born slits his finger, and mingles his blood with Poseidon's own. With the deal made, Poseidon warns that the ruler of Olympus is now Apollo. After letting the First Born on his way, Poseidon and Hades note that the two enemies the First Born faces are formidable. They hope that one will be destroyed by him, while the other will destroy him.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #19 While on Mount Olympus, Apollo is looking at his reflection until it is interrupted by Poseidon who mocks Apollo's claim.Wonder Woman Vol. 4 #20 Powers and abilities Like the other Olympian Gods, Poseidon possesses super-strength, super-speed, shapeshifting, immortality, and invulnerability. Poseidon can control the seas and all life that dwells within them. In other media=Television= * Poseidon appeared in the Justice League episode \\"The Terror Beyond\\". The ruler of an ancient Atlantis, King Poseidon battled the demons called the \\"Old Ones.\\" Knowing that the only way to defeat them for good was to gather all of the mystical energy on Earth, Poseidon gathered all of this energy into a mystical object named the Trident.

Biography Grothmann was born in Frankfurt am Main in 1915. In his youth he studied economics and carved out a career as an accountant at a bank. In 1933 he joined the SS at 18 years old, and was trained the Junkerschule SS. At the beginning of the Second World War, he was given command of SS-Sturmbann N¬∫ 13, a unit of the SS Standarte Deutschland. He took part in the Battle of France and was wounded in combat in June 1940. At the suggestion of Joachim Peiper, Grothmann was appointed second assistant to Heinrich Himmler until July 1942, when he was promoted to aide-de-camp to Himmler. As Himmler's aide, Grothmann accompanied him on all field visits. During the last few days of the war in Europe, Himmler, Grothmann and Heinz Macher traveled from L√ºbeck to Flensburg, where Himmler offered his services as second-in-command to the Flensburg government led by Karl D√∂nitz, successor to Adolf Hitler. D√∂nitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. Himmler was formally dismissed from all his posts. Unwanted by his former colleagues and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. Himmler had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger of the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police), which was a mistake since members of this organization were sought after by the occupation forces. Grothmann and Macher were both dressed as army privates. Grothmann, Himmler, and Macher were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on 21 May and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in L√ºneburg on 23 May. During a routine interrogation, Himmler admitted who he was, and was then taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army. During an attempted medical examination, Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died. After Himmler's suicide, Grothmann and Macher were arrested. Grothmann was taken to a barracks at L√ºbeck, where he was extensively questioned. He denied any knowledge of Operation Reinhard. Then he was taken to an SS prison camp. Grothmann served as a prosecution witness against several SS officials between 1946 and 1948,Records of the United States Nuernberg War Crimes trials Interrogations 1946‚Äì1949 (PDF; 186 kB), published 1977 but during the trial of Karl Wolff he denied having any knowledge of the Final Solution.

Illustration from the late 19th Century. Louis-S√©bastien Lenormand (May 25, 1757 ‚Äì April 4, 1837) was a French chemist, physicist, inventor, and a pioneer in parachuting. He is considered as the first man to make a witnessed descent with a parachute and is also credited with coining the term parachute, from the Latin prefix para meaning \\"against\\", an imperative form of parare = to avoid, avert, defend, resist, guard, shield or shroud, from paro = to parry, and the French word chute for \\"fall\\", hence the word \\"parachute\\" literally means an aeronautic device \\"against a fall\\". After making a jump from a tree with the help of a pair of modified umbrellas, Lenormand refined his contraption and on December 26, 1783 jumped from the tower of the Montpellier observatory in front of a crowd that included Joseph Montgolfier, using a 14-foot parachute with a rigid wooden frame. His intended use for the parachute was to help entrapped occupants of a burning building to escape unharmed. Lenormand was succeeded by Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin who made the first parachute descent from high altitude in a gondola detached from a balloon, with the help of a non-rigid or collapsible parachute on October 22, 1797, and his wife Jeanne Genevi√®ve Labrosse who made a similar descent two years later.  Early life  Lenormand was born in Montpellier on May 25, 1757 as the son of a clockmaker. Between 1775 and 1780, he studied physics and chemistry under Lavoisier and Berthollet in Paris, where he also got involved with the administration of saltpeter. In this position he learned of the use of scientific and mathematical knowledge in the production of gunpowder. After returning to his natal town, he worked in his father's clock shop while immersing himself in the intellectual community and starting his experiments with parachuting, inspired by the performance of a Thai equilibrist who used a parasol for balance. Before performing the public jump from the observatory tower, Lenormand tested his parachutes using animals.  Career as \\"professor of technology\\"  After this public demonstration Lenormand devoted himself to establishing the science of \\"pure technology\\". To this end, he first became a Carthusian monk, as the monastery in Sa√Øx near Castres allowed him to continue his \\"profane\\" studies. When during the French Revolution he had to renounce his priesthood and marry, he moved to Albi to teach technology at a college newly founded by his father-in-law. In 1803 he moved to Paris where he obtained a job at the excise office, part of the finance ministry. During his time at the excise office, Lenormand started publishing in technology journals and filed patents for a paddle boat, a clock successfully installed at the Paris Opera and a public lighting system. When he was removed from his job in 1815, Lenormand got involved even more in publishing, first establishing Les annales de l‚Äôindustrie nationale et √©trang√®re (The Annals of National and Foreign Industry) and Le Mercure technologique (The Technologic Mercury), and, starting in 1822 and continuing until his death in 1837, twenty-volumes of Le Dictionnaire technologique (The Technologic Dictionary). During that time, he also published manuals on such diverse topics as foodstuff and bookbinding. In 1830, Lenormand returned to Castres and, following his estrangement from his wife and her family, renounced his marriage and resumed his religious life as \\"Brother Chrysostom\\". He died there on April 4, 1837 at age 79. In his death certificate, his profession was given as \\"professor of theology\\" as the term technology was still too new at the time.

The level of alcohol-by-volume (ABV) strength for a cask strength whiskey is typically in the range of 52‚Äì66% ABV. Most bottled whiskey is diluted with water to reduce its strength (i.e., ABV level) to a level that makes it less expensive to produce and more palatable to most consumers ‚Äì usually about 40% ABV, which is the statutory minimum in some countries, including the United States. The degree of dilution significantly affects the flavor and general drinking experience of the whiskey.  Production  Cask strength is not the highest proof for a whiskey. Still-strength whiskey is typically a higher proof. Whiskey produced by a pot still increases in strength with each distillation and is typically distilled to about 70% ABV, and column stills are capable of producing much higher proof levels. Most distillers reduce the proof by adding water to the whiskey prior to casking it. The proof level tends to change somewhat during the aging process, depending on storage conditions. Scotch whisky is typically aged in used barrels, and due to the relatively cool climate in Scotland, the proof level typically stays the same or goes down during maturation. In contrast, American bourbon whiskey is produced using new barrels, and storage conditions in Kentucky and Tennessee where nearly all of it is produced allow the proof levels to rise during aging. The vast majority of whiskey bottled has been watered down to about 40‚Äì46% ABV, although some whiskies marketed for whiskey enthusiasts are bottled at proof levels all the way up to cask strength. In the United States, the use of various terms, including \\"barrel proof\\", on product labels is regulated by truth in labeling requirements. Under ruling 79-9 of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a whiskey can only be called \\"barrel proof\\" if the bottling proof is not less than 1% (2 degrees U.S. proof) lower than when the barrels were dumped at the end of the aging period.(ref 5 link broken: text seems to contradict the regulation cited at https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/79-9.htm ) The ruling also covers the use of several other phrases describing high-proof whiskies. The phrases \\"original proof\\", \\"original barrel proof\\", and \\"entry proof\\" are restricted to \\"indicate that the proof of the spirits entered into the barrel and the proof of the bottled spirits are the same\\". Drinking Consumers often add water to cask strength whiskies in order to reduce the \\"heat\\" ‚Äì the \\"burn\\" sensation that goes with the drinking experience ‚Äì and bring out different whiskey flavors. Diluting the whiskey with varying amounts of water will modify the flavor profile, and some consumers like to have control over that. Some add water to the whiskey, while others add ice. The water and temperature affect the taste of the whiskey, and the selection of water is also important. Aficionados suggest using mineral water rather than ordinary tap water, and some even distinguish among different mineral water selections.

The company reports having over one million small cell networks for cellular extension services (aka distributed antenna system (DAS)) and Wi-Fi access that reaches more than one billion consumers annually. The company is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. History In 2001, Earthlink co-founder Sky Dayton founded Boingo to address the then- fragmented state of Wi-Fi networks. He said he saw how Wi-Fi \\"could help make the Internet as ubiquitous as the air we breathe\\". In March 2007, Boingo acquired Concourse Communications Group, which extended Boingo's services into Wi-Fi and cellular DAS networks at airports. On November 10, 2008, Boingo acquired Opti-Fi Networks‚Äô Wi-Fi holdings, adding another 25 airport Wi-Fi networks to its portfolio of managed locations and bringing its total of airport Wi-Fi networks to 55. On May 4, 2011, Boingo Wireless went public, giving the company a market cap of approximately $439 million. The stock price dropped soon afterward, and Boingo's IPO was initially viewed as \\"less than auspicious\\", but the stock recovered a year later to its IPO price. On August 8, 2012, the company acquired Cloud Nine Media, thereby adding advertising services for sponsored Wi-Fi. On February 21, 2013, the company acquired Endeka Group, a provider of Wi-Fi and IPTV services to military bases and federal law enforcement training facilities. In November 2013, Boingo announced contracts with the US Air Force, US Army, and US Marines Corps to install IPTV and broadband access networks on their posts. In September 2013, Boingo announced the acquisition of its largest competitor, Advanced Wireless Group (AWG). At the time of the announcement, AWG operated networks at 17 US airports, including Logan Airport (BOS), Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Miami International Airport(MIA). Boingo announced that the combined entity would operate in 60 percent of North America‚Äôs top 50 airports and more than 40 percent of the world‚Äôs top 50 airports, reaching more than 1.4 billion passengers annually. In February 2014, Boingo launched Passpoint Secure hotspot service at 24 US airports, including LAX, Chicago's O'Hare, and New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports. In June 2014, the company partnered with American Express to offer its Platinum card holders free wireless access. In April 2015, Boingo struck a deal with wireless carrier Sprint Corporation to offload the carrier's customer traffic onto Boingo's Wi-Fi networks at 35 US airports. The deal was reportedly struck to improve Sprint's network performance. As of November 2017, Boingo's market capitalization stood at $1.02 billion. In July 2018, Boingo deployed a private LTE network using the shared 3.5 GHz Citizen's Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) at Dallas' Love Field Airport. In August, the company acquired Charleston, South Carolina-based multifamily and student housing Wi-Fi provider Eluawit Networks. In November, Boingo announced that it had been selected by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York to build and maintain wireless services for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Atlantic Branch and Grand Central Terminal's upcoming East Side Access facility. The two DAS facility deals were reportedly the largest in the company's history. In February 2019, Boingo expanded a Wi-Fi roaming agreement with AT&T.; The deal was designed to offer AT&T; subscribers a seamless and complimentary Wi-Fi connection on Boingo's Passpoint-certified networks. In March, CEO David Hagan retired and was replaced by Mike Finley, a former Qualcomm executive. In August, wireless carrier Verizon announced it was partnering with Boingo to bring the carrier's 5G service to indoor public spaces such as stadiums, airports and hotels. In December, the company announced it had realigned its business to focus on higher growth opportunities it was seeing with DAS, carrier offload, military and multi-family housing. Products and services Boingo acquires long-term wireless rights in large venues like airports, military bases, stadiums, multifamily communities and universities; builds DAS, Wi-Fi, and small cell networks to serve those areas; and monetizes those networks through advertising, carrier fees, or user charges. Its business is divided into higher growth core and legacy business lines and includes the following: *Distributed antenna system (DAS) - Boingo designs, builds and maintains DAS networks for carriers, to improve cellular coverage in buildings. As of November 2019, Boingo has reportedly deployed 37,200 nodes and claims to be the largest indoor DAS provider in the United States. Its DAS deployments include Chicago's O‚ÄôHare International Airport, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York City, and the Oculus World Trade Center Transportation hub. *Wi-Fi Offload - Boingo sells wireless carriers the ability to offload their licensed network traffic onto unlicensed spectrum. *Small cell - Boingo designs and manages small cell networks in venues and sells carriers access to the network.

When he first came to Glamorgan Jones was a specialist right-handed batsman but after being tutored by Phil Clift he became a wicketkeeper. He made his first-class debut in 1961, and served as deputy keeper to David Evans until the late 1960s, when he became the county's first-choice keeper, a position he held until 1982. He took a record 933 dismissals for his county. In 1970 he took 7 dismissals in an innings against Cambridge University, and he finished the season with 94 dismissals. However, the continued good form of Alan Knott and Bob Taylor kept him out of consideration for the Test team. In 1968 he made the highest ever score by a Glamorgan keeper with 146 not out against Sussex. His most successful season with the bat was Glamorgan's championship season of 1969, when he scored 753 runs at an average of 31.37. Thereafter his batting gradually declined, and after 1975 he never averaged as high as 20 in a season. He retired after the 1983 season, at the age of 41.

Baker was born in Hunmanby, Yorkshire, England, and made his debut against Middlesex at the Prince's Ground, Chelsea in May 1874 and scored nine, opening Yorkshire's first innings. He dropped down the order for the second innings, but was instrumental in sealing the Tykes' five wicket win, putting on an unbeaten 28 for the sixth wicket in partnership with Allen Hill. His second appearance was also against Middlesex in the return game at Scarborough in September. Batting down at number 8, he hit his career high of 22 in Yorkshire's first innings of 172, but did not bat again as the game was drawn, with Middlesex fighting back after following on, 112 runs behind.

The Grand Orient joins the Grand Orient of France and other Continental jurisdictions in not requiring initiates to believe in a Supreme Being (Great Architect of the Universe). This meant that in the 1870s the Orient broke with the United Grand Lodge of England.

In 1989 the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium and the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain signed an agreement of mutual recognition.

He was a minor statesman of the French Revolution, and a cardinal and important figure of the Bourbon Restoration. Family and early life La Luzerne's family was one of the most illustrious of the Normandy. His father Cesar-Antoine, was a Mar√©chal de camp in the king's army, his mother was Marie-Elisabeth de Lamoignon de Blancmesnil (1716-1758), the daughter of Lord Chancellor Lamoignon (served 1750-1768) and the sister of the extraordinary Secretary of State Malesherbes. His brothers were C√©sar Henri, comte de La Luzerne, Naval Minister (1787-1790) and Anne-C√©sar, ambassador to the United States and to the court of London. Cesar-Guillaume was the middle son and so intended by his family to go into the church, and so attended the seminary of Saint-Magloire. In 1754, while still a young man, his grandfather arranged his appointment to the position of Canon of Notre Dame Cathedral. In 1756, he was named abbot of Mortemer Abbey. His studies at Coll√®ge de Navarre continued throughout this time, and he so distinguished himself that when, in 1762, Monsignor Dillon was appointed Archbishop of Narbonne, he chose La Luzerne for his Great Vicar. In 1765, he was named Agent-General of the Clergy of the ecclesiastical province of Vienne, a very challenging position at that time, because of the challenges that occurred between the clergy and the parlements. His closest ally in these struggles was J√©r√¥me Champion de Cic√©. Bishop of Langres On June 24, 1770, the king appointed La Luzerne to the very prestigious position of Duke-Bishop of Langres, (an ancient French peerage). Despite the promotion he remained Canon of Notre Dame and in this capacity performed many state funerals including that of Louis XV in 1774. La Luzerne took his duties very seriously and invested heavily in renovations to church property, establishing seminaries, and conducting synods and assemblies. Catholicism flourished in his diocese under his watch. As a Duke-Bishop he had a right to participate in the Assembly of Notables (1787-1788). French Revolution La Luzerne was elected by the Second Estate of the bailiwick of Langres to the Estates-General (1789). He was from the very beginning an opponent of the doubling of the Third Estate and of the union of orders, and despaired at the foundation of the National Assembly. He was elected president of the assembly (31 August 1789 - 9 September) but resigned within days in protest of a speech made by the marquis de Lally-Tollendall. He withdrew from the National Assembly after the October Days (5‚Äì6 October 1789) and officially resigned in December 1789. In 1791, he refused to take the constitutional oath; his opposition to the reorganisation of the church seriously damaged its viability, and he united opposition under him. He soon after fled France, emigrating to Constance and Venice, where he gave hospitality to French exiles and wrote extensively. Under the Restoration he returned to France, became cardinal and state minister (1817) and was re-appointed to the See of Langres which he had resigned at the time of the Concordat. Works An excellent apologist and a lucid expounder of Catholic faith and Christian ethics, La Luzerne, like Denis-Luc Frayssinous, Talleyrand-P√©rigord and Bausset, was a belated representative of the old Gallicanism. His efforts to revive it failed, owing partly to the fall of the Bourbons and partly because of the writers who, in \\"L'Avenir\\" and other publications, gave to France a definite Roman orientation. His principal works are: \\"Oraison fun√®bre de Louis XV\\" (Paris, 1774), Consid√©rations sur divers points de la morale chr√©tienne (Venice, 1795‚Äì1799), Explication des √©vangiles des dimanches et des fetes(Venice, 1807), and Sur la d√©claration de l‚ÄôAssembl√©e du Clerg√© de France en 1682 (Paris, 1821).

Five days later, The New Yorker published an interview with Essjay which repeated some of the false claims on his user page.Schiff, Stacy. \\"Know it all: Can wikipedia conquer expertise?\\", The New Yorker, July 31, 2006. In January 2007, Brandt contacted the author of the article in The New Yorker about the discrepancies in Jordan's biography and the exploitation of his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over wikipedia content. The controversy that ensued focused on his falsification of a persona and qualifications, the impact of this deception on perceptions of wikipedia (and its policies and credibility), and the quality of decisions made in his promotion, support, and employment.Ian King, Cohen, Noam. \\"After False Claim, wikipedia to Check Degrees\\", The New York Times, March 12, 2007.Finkelstein, Seth. \\"Read me first\\", The Guardian, March 8, 2007. Reactions to the disclosure were diverse, encompassing commentary and articles in electronic, print, and broadcast media; the wikipedia community researched Essjay's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes. wikipedia co- founder Jimmy Wales initially supported Essjay's use of a persona, saying, \\"I regard it as a pseudonym and I don't really have a problem with it.\\"Ratcliffe, Mitch (March 5, 2007), wikipedia: Why does Essjay need to \\"protect himself\\"? , Zdnet.com. Retrieved March 7, 2007. Later, Wales withdrew his support and asked for Essjay's resignation from his positions with wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned that \\"Essjay used his false credentials in content disputes\\" on wikipedia. The New Yorker interview Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist writing for The New Yorker, interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about wikipedia (\\"Know It All\\"; July 31, 2006) after he was recommended to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. According to The New Yorker, Essjay \\"was willing to describe his work as a wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page.\\" During the interview, Jordan told The New Yorker and had previously stated on his wikipedia user page that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law and worked as a tenured professor at a private university.A public viewable version of this claim as dated 2006 is visible on the Internet Archive . It was later discovered that he was 24 years old, and had dropped out of community college with no qualifications. The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention. The article said that Essjay spent some 14 hours or more a day on wikipedia but was careful to keep his online life a secret from his colleagues and friends. It portrayed Essjay as often taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other wikipedians while giving a quiz. He asserted that he required anonymity to avoid cyberstalking. Jordan, as Essjay, claimed he sent an email to a college professor using his invented persona's credentials, vouching for wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, \\"I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my wikipedia user page (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials.\\" =Identity revealed= When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he changed his Wikia profile and \\"came clean on who he really was\\", identifying himself as Ryan Jordan. Other wikipedia editors questioned Essjay on his wikipedia talk page about the apparent discrepancy between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials.wikipedia:wikipedia Signpost/2007-03-05/Essjay Essjay posted a detailed explanation in response to the first inquiry, stating that: He later commented on his wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by \\"... doing a good job playing the part.\\" wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then wrote a letter reporting the identity discrepancy to Stacy Schiff and The New Yorker. In late February 2007, the magazine updated its article with a correction indicating that \\"Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught.\\" On February 23, 2007, Jimmy Wales announced the appointment of Essjay to wikipedia's Arbitration Committee. Wales later asserted that the appointment was \\"at the request of and unanimous support of\\" the Arbitration Committee. On March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a portion of Essjay's comments on the incident entered \\"the dangerous domain of defamation and libel\\" against Stacy Schiff. Lih stated that on Essjay's wikipedia talk page, Essjay had written, \\"Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead.\\" Lih noted: Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it, Schiff stated that Essjay's assertion was \\"complete nonsense\\". On March 6, 2007, Jordan's hometown newspaper published an article casting doubts about his January 2007 claims on his Wikia userpage that he had worked for the United States Trustee Program and had been a Kentucky paralegal. On March 12, 2007, The New Yorker published a formal apology by Wales in its March 19 The Mail section. Reaction=wikipedia community= Speaking personally about Jordan, Wales said, \\"Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation.\\" Essjay had responded at the time with a statement on his wikipedia page, in part reading: Reaction from within the wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp, voluminous, and mixed. While most editors denounced at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud. As the controversy unfolded, the wikipedia community began a review of Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. \\"People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments\\", said Michael Snow, a wikipedia administrator and founder of the wikipedia community newspaper, the Signpost. \\"Those will get looked at again.\\" For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies, a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: \\"This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on credibility.\\" In another case (a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms), he cited personal experience from \\"the Abbey of Gethsemani, where I was a monk.\\" Jimmy Wales proposed a credential verification system on wikipedia following the Essjay controversy, but the proposal was rejected. Wales was \\"reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes.\\" \\"I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address\\", Wales added. He insisted that wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. \\"We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle\\", Wales commented. However, he also warned that \\"It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate.\\" However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, \\"I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor.\\" A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would need to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the wikipedia community,WP:CRED like all previous such proposals. As a follow-up to his initial comments to The New Yorker, Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which appeared in its March 19, 2007 issue: Wales expressed his regret that Essjay had \\"made a series of very bad judgments.\\" He also commented that he hoped wikipedia would improve as a result of the controversy. =wikipedia commenters= Journalist and wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski Andrew Orlowski, a frequent wikipedia critic and writer for The Register‚Äîa British technology news and opinion website‚Äîcriticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded Wikia and for appointing him to the wikipedia Arbitration Committee after Essjay had apparently admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within wikipedia. Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe, who asked \\"why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information\\" and asked for additional details \\"such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements.\\" Larry Sanger, co-founder of wikipedia who left the project in 2002, called Essjay's response \\"a defiant non-apology\\" and elsewhere characterized Essjay's actions as \\"identity fraud\\". Other comments: * BusinessWeek commented on proposals for credential verification: \\"Sadly, not everyone who posts to wikipedia is concerned with the Ten Commandments. Some are concerned with revenge. Some with self-aggrandizement. Some just have nothing better to do. We live in an age of fake IDs, fake money, fake e-mails, fake URLs, fake IP addresses, and fake votes...\\" However, the article argued that wikipedia could not become a \\"net police\\" of reliability on the Internet. * Steve Maich (journalist, Maclean's) stated that the controversy could damage wikipedia's future as a media business operation, observing that wikipedia's model was supposedly built upon trust and credibility. * Cassandra Jardine, a Daily Telegraph contributor, opined that Essjay was \\"hooked on 'Wiki crack'‚Äîdevotees' jargon for the thrill of seeing your efforts debated.\\" She further observed that \\"Essjay has provided a reminder that any given entry could have been written by someone as ignorant as ourselves. On the other hand, no one has taken issue with his edits, only his assumed persona, so perhaps the real lesson of this democratic medium is that college drop-outs might be as authoritative as professors.\\" * Andrew Keen (author, Cult of the Amateur) described the controversy as an example of ignoring expert guidance in favor of the \\"dictatorship of idiots.\\" * Alex Beam (columnist, The Boston Globe) criticized the Essjay affair as being part of what he characterizes as the problems of \\"crowdsourcing\\" and the \\"wisdom of crowds\\" stating also that the crowd accepts authority unquestioningly: \\"Who would you rather have write your encyclopedia entries? Bertrand Russell, T.H. Huxley, and Benedetto Croce, who wrote for the Britannica? Or ... EssJay?\\" =Academics= Following the media coverage of the Essjay controversy, a number of academics noted the damage to the credibility of wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education commented \\"the incident is clearly damaging to wikipedia's credibility‚Äîespecially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud.\\" Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review, saying, \\"They could make up your life if they wanted to.\\" Brann also said that wikipedia \\"has no place in the University\\", and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia. Nicola Pratt, a lecturer in international relations at the University of East Anglia in England, stated, \\"The ethos of wikipedia is that anyone can contribute, regardless of status... What's relevant is their knowledge as judged by other readers, not whether they are professors or not‚Äîand the fact the student [Essjay] was exposed shows it works.\\" In 2009, a lengthy article was published by the National Council of Teachers of English discussing the challenges of determining textual origins in college compositions, using a detailed history of the Essjay incident to set the context.

This period took in Surrey's seven successive County Championship wins from 1952 to 1958, to which he made a valuable contribution.

The double century was particularly memorable as it took only 5 hours. Small in stature, Constable was a fine cutter of the ball.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950 edition, Surrey Report He batted up and down the order as the needs of the team demanded. He was a useful leg spinner early in his career becoming an occasional change later on. Micky Stewart said of him: \\"He knew the game inside out and every first-class player inside out. I learned more about cricket from Bernie Constable than from anyone else.\\" His brother, Dennis, was also a first-class cricketer.

He is believed to be the only professional painter of Chechen origin in the 19th century.Grozny Art Museum Biography of famous Chechens  Biography  In 1819, during the Caucasian War Russian troops found a dead woman and a dying wounded three-year-old baby in the Chechen aul Dady-Yurt. The commander-in-chief of the Russian army Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov ordered military medics to do everything possible to save this baby despite all medical advice saying that it was impossible. Against all the odds, the baby survived.Article P.Zakharov on the Russian History in the mirror of visual arts site The baby was given for nursing to Cossack Zakhar Nedonosov. From the name of this Cossack, the baby got his surname and patronymic.Zakharov- Chechenets article on the Chechen Cultural Figures site Later Pyotr appended the word Chechenets to his surname in order to show his ethnic identity. At the age of seven, Pyotr was adopted by Major-General Pyotr Yermolov, Commander of a Georgian Grenadier regiment and a cousin of Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov. Pyotr Yermolov liked Zakharov very much and, despite having seven children of his own, treated him as his own son. The boy showed talent in painting and Pyotr Yermolov tried to send him to the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg but the president of the Academy, Aleksey Olenin, claimed that the 10-year-old boy was too young to study at the Academy and recommended hiring a private teacher. So, the boy got lessons from the portraitist Lev Volkov. Eventually, at the age of 17, Zakharov entered the Academy. He graduated in 1835 with a diploma of Free Artist and was recommended for a scholarship to study art in Italy. The trip might have been helpful for both his artistic growth and for his health, which had begun to show signs of tuberculosis. However, his name was withdrawn from the list for the scholarship by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia who insisted that national minorities (inorodtsy) should not benefit from the Academy's scholarships. Another misfortune followed as Zakarov's first teacher, Lev Volkov, refused to allow his daughter to marry Zakharov despite the young people being in love. Instead Volkov had her sent to relatives in the Caucasus with an order to marry her off to any first-comer just to stop the affair. Zakharov soon became a fashionable portraitist. His clients included the favorite daughter of Nicholas I, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna and her future husband Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg. In 1837, he was admitted to the state service as an Artist in the Military Department. In 1842, his Portrait of Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov qualified him to become a member of the Academy of Arts.Pyotr Zakharov in the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary On 14 January 1846, Zakharov married, but their happiness was short. On 13 June 1846, his wife died from tuberculosis. Zakharov died from the same disease a few months later. Many works of Zakharov-Chechenets are kept in the Tretyakov Gallery and in the Russian Museum. The Art Museum in the capital of Chechnya, Grozny also used to have many of his works including his Selfportrait, and Portrait of I.F. Ladygensky. In 1995 during the First Chechen War the Grozny Museum was heavily damaged and the paintings were all but destroyed. Since 1995, they are being restored at the Grabar Restoration Center in Moscow.

Himachal Pradesh was established in 1948 as a Chief Commissioner's Province within the Union of India. The Himachal History The province comprised the hill districts around Shimla and southern hill areas of the former Punjab region. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956. On 18 December 1970 the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union. In earlier times, the area was variously divided among smaller kingdoms, such as those of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal and Dhami. After the Gurkha War of 1815‚Äì1816, it became part of the British India. Pre- Independence=Prehistory= Some evidences have been found that nearly 2 million years ago man lived in the foothills of Himachal Pradesh. Bangana valley of Kangra, Sirsa valley of Nalagarh and Markanda valley of Sirmour are found to be the places where prehistoric man used to live. The foothills of the state were inhabited by people from Indus valley civilization which flourished between the time period of 2250 and 1750 BC. Before indus valley civilization, Koli, Holi, Dooms and Chnnals used to live here. The famous war between the Arya King Devodas and Kirat's King Shambhar is mentioned in the Rigveda. King Shambhar had 99 forts in mid Himalayan region of modern Himachal. He had to lose the war which lasted for 40 years. =Medieval history= In about 883 AD Shankar Verma, the ruler of Kashmir exercised his influence over Himachal Pradesh. The region also witnessed the invasion of Mahmud Ghazni in 1009 AD, who during that period looted the wealth from the temples in the North India. In 1043 AD the Rajputs ruled over the territory. Sansar Chand (c. 1765‚Äì1823) In 1773 AD the Rajputs under Katoch Maharaja Sansar Chand-II possessed the region, until the attack by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1804 which crushed the Rajput power. The small kingdom enjoyed a large degree of independence till the eve of the Muslim invasions in northern India. The states of the foothills were devastated by Muslim invaders a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles. The Gorkhas, a martial tribe came to power in Nepal in 1768. They consolidated their military power and began to expand their territory. The Gurkhas marched in from Nepal and captured the area. Gradually the Gorkhas annexed Sirmour and Shimla. Under the leadership of Bada Kaji (equivalent to General) Amar Singh Thapa, Gorkhas laid siege to Kangra. They managed to defeat Sansar Chand, the ruler of Kangra, in 1806. However Gorkhas could not capture Kangra fort which came under Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1809. =British period= This led to the Anglo-Gorkha war. They came into direct conflict with the British along the tarai belt after which the British expelled them from the provinces of the Satluj. Thus British gradually emerged as the paramount powers. In early 19th century the British annexed the areas of Shimla after the Gurkha War of 1815‚Äì16. Himachal became a centrally administered territory in 1948 with the integration of 31 hill provinces and received additional regions in 1966. The revolt of 1857 or the first Indian war of independence resulted due to the building up of political, social, economic, religious and military grievances against the British government. People of the hill states were not politically alive as the people in other parts of the country. They remained more or less inactive and so did their rulers with the exception of Bushahr. Some of them even rendered help to the British government during the revolt. Among them were the rulers of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal and Dhami. The rulers of Bushars rather acted in a manner hostile to the interests of British. The British territories in the hill came under British Crown after Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858. The states of Chamba, Mandi and Bilaspur made good progress in many fields during the British rule. During World War I, virtually all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and contributed to the British war effort both in the form of men and materials. Amongst these were the states of Kangra, Nurpur, Chamba, Suket, Mandi and Bilaspur. Post independence After independence the Chief Commissioner's province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India. Himachal Pradesh became Union Territory on 1 November 1956. On 18 December 1970 the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus H.P. emerged as the eighteenth state of Indian Union. Under the name of Greater Nepal, some in Nepal have asked for the return of states previously usurped by Nepal that were annexed by the British East India Company. However, little support for this motion exists in these regions.

Though the routes also run along other major avenues, the majority of their route is along Madison and Fifth Avenues between Greenwich Village and Harlem. The routes are the successors to the New York and Harlem Railroad's Fourth and Madison Avenues Line, which began operations in 1832 as the first street railway in the world, and several lines of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company, a bus operator that started running on Fifth Avenue in 1886. Description The M1, M2, M3, and M4 all run between Midtown or Lower Manhattan and Upper Manhattan, while the Q32 runs from Midtown north along Fifth and Madison Avenues and east over the Queensboro Bridge to Jackson Heights, Queens. The M4 terminates and originates near Penn Station, while the Q32 begins at Penn Station, joining Madison Avenue at 32nd Street (northbound) and leaving Fifth Avenue at 37th Street (southbound). Thus, all five routes are on Fifth and Madison Avenues from 34th Street to 110th Street. =M1= The M1 begins its route in SoHo at the intersection of Centre Street and Grand Street. It continues up Centre and Lafayette Streets, then 4th Avenue to Union Square, where it changes names to Union Square East. Union Square East continues past Union Square as Park Avenue South. The M1 turns off Park Avenue South at East 25th Street for one block, and then immediately turns right onto Madison Avenue. The M1 follows Madison Avenue all the way to East 135th Street, where it again turns left for one block, and then immediately turns right onto Fifth Avenue (becoming a two-way at this point). It travels up Fifth to West 139th Street, turns left for a block, and turns right onto Lenox Avenue to its terminus at 148th Street. The M1 travels south the same route, but entirely on Fifth Avenue between 139th Street and 8th Street (except for a short deviation around Marcus Garvey Park at 124th Street), then on Broadway from 8th Street to Grand Street. During weekdays, every other southbound trip terminates in East Village, Manhattan, using 8th Street (St. Marks Place) to travel between 5th and 4th Avenues. The M1 has a peak direction limited stop service on weekday rush hours; it is local at all other times. The M1 is the replacement of the Fourth and Madison Avenues Streetcar Line. =M2= The M2 follows the same route as the M1 north until East 110th Street, where it turns west. It travels around Duke Ellington Circle and along Central Park North to Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and turns right (north). The M2 follows 7th Avenue (as it is locally known) until West 155th Street, where it turns left and then turns right onto Edgecombe Avenue. The M2 follows Edgecombe Avenue to West 165th Street, and terminates at West 168th Street and Audubon Avenue. It follows the same route south, except using Fifth Avenue instead of Madison. The M2 runs as a limited-stop service, with no local service during the daytime. At other times, it runs local only. =M3= The M3 follows the same route as the M2, except it continues west past Powell Boulevard along West 110th Street to Manhattan Avenue. It follows Manhattan Avenue, which becomes St. Nicholas Avenue, to its terminus at St. Nicholas Avenue and West 193rd Street in the Fort George section of Washington Heights. During late nights the M3 terminates at St. Nicholas Avenue and 125th Street. =M4= alt= The M4 begins at the intersection of East 32nd Street and Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. It turns left onto Madison Avenue and follows the same route as the M3 from here, except it continues west past Manhattan Avenue along West 110th Street, then Cathedral Parkway, to Broadway. The M4 turns north onto Broadway and travels along Broadway to West 165th Street. At 165th Street, the M4 turns left and then immediately turns right onto Fort Washington Avenue. The M4 continues up Ft. Washington Avenue to the entrance of Fort Tryon Park. When The Cloisters Museum is open, the M4 continues north along Margaret Corbin Drive to the entrance to the museum. M4 buses make limited-stops in the peak direction during weekday rush hours (downtown in the morning, uptown in the evening). Local service runs at all other times. History An M1 bus traveling south along Fifth Avenue near Central Park. =The Fourth and Madison Avenues Line= The New York and Harlem Railroad was the first railroad in Manhattan, opening from City Hall north along Centre Street, Broome Street (northbound trains were later moved to Grand Street), the Bowery, Fourth Avenue, and Park Avenue to Harlem in the 1830s, and was extended southwest along Park Row to Broadway in 1852. A branch opened along 42nd Street and Madison Avenue to 73rd Street in 1870, and the NY&H; began to operate streetcars along this route; it was later extended to Harlem. Buses were substituted for streetcars by the Madison Avenue Coach Company in March 1936. The New York City Omnibus Corporation took over operations in 1951, and changed its name to Fifth Avenue Coach Lines in 1956; the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority took over operations in 1962. When the bus that replaced the Lexington and Lenox Avenues Line was terminated, the Madison Avenue bus was extended west on 139th Street and north on Lenox Avenue to 147th Street. When Madison Avenue became one-way northbound, southbound traffic was moved to Fifth Avenue, replacing the original route of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company. The Fifth Avenue Transportation Company (later the Fifth Avenue Coach Company) began operating stages on Fifth Avenue between 11th Street and 59th Street on January 23, 1886.The New York Times, Fifth-Avenue Stages Running, January 24, 1886, page 2 The company was formed because the wealthy residents of Fifth Avenue did not want a street railway. The route was later extended south to Washington Square Park and north to 89th Street, and in 1900 the company was authorized to extend north to 135th Street, and to operate on other streets including 110th Street and Riverside Drive to 124th Street. More extensions, on 32nd Street from Fifth Avenue west to Seventh Avenue (Penn Station) and north from 110th Street on Seventh Avenue and Manhattan Avenue/St. Nicholas Avenue to 155th Street, were soon authorized. After the company's horse cars were replaced with motor buses in July 1907, it began operating these extensions, and assigned them numbers in 1916 or 1917:The New York Times, Remember Figures Better than Colors, June 25, 1916, page XX9Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac, 1916 and 1917 #Fifth Avenue to 135th Street #Fifth and Seventh Avenues to Polo Grounds (155th Street and St. Nicholas Place) #Fifth and St. Nicholas Avenues to Polo Grounds #Fifth Avenue and Riverside Drive via 110th Street to 135th Street and Broadway #Fifth Avenue and Riverside Drive via 57th Street to 135th Street and Broadway #72nd Street Crosstown via 57th Street The Fifth Avenue Coach Company (FACCo) obtained a permit on July 1, 1925 and on July 9 began operating its 15 and 16 routes.The New York Times, Listing of Routes Hit by Strike, March 5, 1962, page 47; The New York Times, Buses Running, March 23, 1962, page 21 The 15 (now the Q32) began at Fifth Avenue and 25th Street at Madison Square Park, and traveled north on Fifth Avenue, east via 57th Street to the Queensboro Bridge, and along Queens Boulevard, Roosevelt Avenue, and 25th Street (now 82nd Street) to Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights, Queens. The short 16 (Elmhurst Crosstown) was renamed Q89 on July 1, 1974, began at Roosevelt Avenue and 82nd Street and used Baxter Avenue and Broadway to reach Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst.The New York Times, Plans to Link All Suburban Transit, July 10, 1925, page 19 Even before the Fifth Avenue company began operating its coaches, the New York and Harlem Railroad was operating its Fourth and Madison Avenues Line of horse cars, later trolleys, mainly on Fourth Avenue below and Madison Avenue above 42nd Street (Grand Central Terminal). The Madison Avenue Coach Company, a New York Railways subsidiary,The New York Times, Bus Grants Asked on 8th and 9th Avs., February 7, 1935, page 3 started operating replacement buses on February 1, 1935. Several changes were made to the route: instead of the Bowery, a shorter alignment via Centre Street and Lafayette Street was used, and a variant stayed on Madison Avenue south to 26th Street and short-turned at Astor Place.The New York Times, Swift Buses Oust Madison Trolleys, February 1, 1935, page 23 As part of the New York City Omnibus Corporation system (NYCO; also a New York Railways subsidiary), these two routes were numbered 1 (via Park Avenue) and 2 (short-turn via Madison Avenue).New York City Omnibus Corporation Motor Coach Routes, ca. 1940 =Extensions and combinations= On July 17, 1960, Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue became a one-way pair. The NYCO's 4, which had traveled along Lexington Avenue, 116th Street, and Lenox Avenue to northern Harlem, was discontinued. To cover this travel pattern, the 1 was extended west on 135th Street and north on Lenox Avenue, and the 2 was realigned to turn west on 116th Street and north on Lenox Avenue.The New York Times, One-Way Bus Schedules Given For Lexington and 3d Avenues, July 12, 1960, page 37 The path of the 1 and 2 south of Union Square was changed on November 10, 1963 to use Broadway rather than Fourth Avenue and Lafayette Street, due to Lafayette Street becoming one-way northbound and Broadway becoming one-way southbound.The New York Times, City to Extend One-Way Traffic To 3 Manhattan Routes Sunday, November 5, 1963, page 1 On that same day, the southern terminus for FACCo's 2 and 3 was moved to 8th Street and Fourth Avenue,Stengren, Bernard. \\" 'VILLAGE' TO GET MORE BUS RUNS; 15-an-Hour Scheduling on 5th Ave.-Houston St. Line Will Begin on Sunday.\\" The New York Times, November 8, 1963, page 33 after terminating the prior two months at 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and University Place following a ban on all bus traffic through their prior terminus of Washington Square imposed by the city on September 2, 1963.Kaplan, Samuel. \\"City to Close Washington Square to All Buses; New Routing to Bypass Park Beginning Monday ‚Äî Traffic Around Square Will Go Counter-Clockwise.\\" The New York Times, August 31, 1963, page 1 As part of the new pattern, the 2 and 3 turned at Fourth Avenue onto Wanamaker Place and then onto Fifth Avenue. Fifth and Madison Avenues became one-way streets on January 14, 1966, and the four FACCo routes on Fifth Avenue past Central Park and the two NYCO routes on Madison Avenue were combined into four routes on both avenues. In particular, the following changes were made:The New York Times, Barnes Suggests Express Bus Runs, January 17, 1966, page 1The New York Times, One-Way Avenues Slow Bus Traffic, January 26, 1966, page 32 *The NYCO's 1 and FACCo's 1 were combined. The northbound route of the new 1 followed the old NYCO 1 along Park Avenue, 39th Street, Madison Avenue, 135th Street, and Lenox Avenue, and the southbound route used Lenox Avenue and 135th to join the old FACCo 1 at Fifth Avenue. Buses left the old FACCo route at 40th Street, heading south on the old NYCO route on Park Avenue and Broadway. *The NYCO's 2 and FACCo's 2 (since extended to 168th Street via Edgecombe Avenue) were combined. Again, the southbound route generally followed the FACCo's 2, and the northbound route was the NYCO's 2. North of 110th Street, the combined route had two variants, watching the two divergent routes. One, designated by MaBSTOA as the Seventh Avenue branch (and numbered 2A), followed the FACCo's 2 along 110th Street and Seventh Avenue, continuing along Seventh and Edgecombe Avenues to 168th Street, while the other (designated the Lenox Avenue branch) used 116th Street and Lenox Avenue to 147th Street (NYCO's 2). FACCo's 2 was renamed 2A from 1966 to 1974, while NYCO's 2 had its route south of 116th Street moved to Third Avenue northbound and Lexington Avenue southbound, and its route number changed to 101A, on March 2, 1969 (renumbered M102 on July 1, 1974).\\"Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority: The First Ten Years.\\" Motor Coach Age, May 1972. *The FACCo's 3 (since extended to Fort George via St. Nicholas Avenue), 4 (since extended to Fort Tryon Park via Fort Washington Avenue, and ending at Penn Station in the south), and 15 were essentially moved northbound from Fifth Avenue to Madison Avenue south of 110th Street. Where it made a difference, the NYCO's 2 was more closely followed. The 1 and 4 routes (later the M1 and M4, respectively) were among the first routes to get limited-stop service, in 1973. = Recent changes = Limited-stop service on the M2 began on October 14, 1991, replacing local service between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. On June 25, 2010, as a result of service cuts, MTA no longer operated weekend M1 service into Midtown, instead terminating at 106th Street. After numerous requests to rescind some of the 2010 service cuts, the MTA restored the M1 to 8th Street on the weekends on January 6, 2013. There was a proposal underway to re-extend this line back down to Worth Street in early 2017. In this proposal, every other bus would go to Worth Street via Bowery and Third Avenue, returning uptown via Centre Street and Lafayette Street. The M1 was extended back down to Grand Street on September 3, 2017, though downtown buses run on Broadway. Service will eventually be re-extended to Worth Street, after which the downtown buses running below 8th Street will be rerouted onto Bowery. In April 2018, it was proposed to permanently truncate the M4's southern terminal to 41st Street. This was due to a street-widening along 32nd Street that would cause delays for M4 buses from terminating there, since that portion of the route was shared with the Q32, which continues northward from Penn Station to Jackson Heights, Queens. The change would occur in summer 2018. To allow M4 riders to access Penn Station, and vice versa, free transfers would be available between Q32 and M4 buses going in the same direction. However, the plan was then changed to have the M4 continue down to 32nd Street, where it would terminate midway between 5th and Madison Avenues, two blocks from Penn Station. This was likely done to minimize the impact of the route changes because of the 32nd Street widening, while still maintaining the same connectivity with other routes, like the at 34th Street.

The distillery is now run by Diageo and the distillery's Scotch whisky makes up an important part of the Johnnie Walker blended whiskies. The word \\"Cardhu\\" derives from the Scots Gaelic Carn Dubh, meaning \\"Black Rock\\". History The distillery was established in 1824 by John Cumming, who had previously been a whisky smuggler. The distillery was sited high up on Mannoch Hill, above the River Spey due to the peat softening the water. The distillery started as farm distillery working on a seasonal basis after the harvest had been gathered. The distillery was mainly run by Helen Cumming who used to sell bottles of whisky to passers-by through the window of their farmhouse. Due to the hill the farm distillery was on, Helen could see the police coming and would throw flour on herself and say that she was baking bread to disguise the smell. She would then offer them tea and fly a flag outside so that the other nearby distilleries could see and take prompt action. In 1885 the distillery was rebuilt on a new piece of land but continued to stay in the hands of the Cummings, being run by Elizabeth Cumming, the daughter-in-law of John and Helen Cumming. The stills from the old distillery building were sold to William Grant who set up Glenfiddich distillery. The new building and stills meant that Cardhu could produce triple the amount of whisky it had previously produced. These higher production levels led to Johnnie Walker and Sons buying much of Cardhu's output to put into their increasingly popular blend. In 1893 Elizabeth Cumming sold the distillery to Johnnie Walker and Sons on the condition that the Cumming family could continue the day-to-day running of the distillery. Cardhu distillery kept working under these conditions until the onset of the Second World War when wartime restrictions meant that it was harder to use barley for distilling purposes. In 1960 the distillery's still- house, mash-house and tun-room were rebuilt, and in 1970 steam coils were introduced to heat the stills and the number of stills was increased to six.

Company history TC Electronic was founded by two musician brothers, Kim and John Rish√∏j. Their SCF, (\\"Stereo Chorus + Pitch Modulator & Flanger\\") was a successful early product. After initial success with guitar effect pedals, they developed 19\\" rack mounted processors, including the TC2290 delay released in 1985. TC Electronic formed the current TC Group in 2002 after acquiring TGI plc. TGI consisted of Tannoy, GLL Goodman, Lab.Gruppen and Martin Audio. Martin Audio was sold quickly after the merger and Goodman Loudspeakers closed. TC Works (software development), based in Germany, was once part of the TC group, but reintegrated with TC Electronic in 2005. The current TC Group is a holding company of five individual brand companies consisting of Tannoy, (speakers and studio monitors), Lab.Gruppen (amplifiers), TC Electronic, TC-Helicon (harmonisers and vocal processors) and TCApplied Technologies (digital-audio semiconductor development) and the sales-companies TC GroupInternational, TC GroupAmericas, TC GroupJapan, TC GroupChina, and TC GroupMiddle East. TC Electronic also co-develops products with Dynaudio Acoustics (studio monitors) and their European sales arm TC GroupInternational distributes Blue Microphones outside of the US. The company was purchased by Music Group (Behringer) in August 2015.  Products = System 6000 = System 6000 is an audio mastering system built around the Mainframe 6000. It houses DSP-based electronics for processing and provides audio inputs and outputs. The Mainframe 6000 connects via Ethernet to either the Remote CPU 6000 and the TC ICON hardware controller, or to a computer running TC ICON emulation software. The System 6000 comes in two versions‚ÄîReverb 6000 and Mastering 6000. The two differ in included processing algorithms: Reverb 6000 comes with reverb and delay effects for stereo and multi-channel purposes, while Mastering 6000 comes with algorithms suited for stereo and multi-channel audio mastering, and includes pitch-shifting tools. Several optional algorithms are available separately. The System 6000 series was upgraded to MK2 in 2010. = Finalizer = The Finalizer is an audio mastering tool available two versions: Finalizer 96K and Finalizer Express. Both Finalizers have a compressor, limiter, equaliser and a Gain Maximiser. The Finalizer Express is a less-functional version of the Finalizer 96K that does not perform 96 kHz processing. = Guitar products = TC Electronic G System. Since the company began with guitar effects, the current line of TC Electronic products remain an important aspect of the company's business. There are several product categories: *Nova - Includes a line of pedals (Delay, Reverb, Modulator, Drive) and the Nova System Multi Effects processor. *G-Series - Includes the top of the range G System (floor processor and switching unit), the dedicated acoustic processor G Natural and rack processors G Major 2 and G-Force. *Tuners - PolyTune (introduced 2010) is the world's first polyphonic guitar tuner. *Compact Pedals - Includes the original SCF (Stereo Chorus Flanger), Ditto mini, HOF mini, VPD1, MojoMojo Overdrive and Dark Matter Distortion. *TonePrint Pedals - Released at the NAMM'10 show these digital pedals have the ability to have TonePrints (custom presets by famous guitar & bass players) downloaded free from the TC website added and uploaded to the pedal via. a mini USB socket. Includes the Hall of Fame and Flashback II = Bass amplification products = In 2009, TC Electronic released a class D bass amplifier, RH450 (originally called RebelHead 450, but this name was cancelled later) along with the complementary RC 4 foot switch. In addition to this, TC Electronic developed a range of speaker cabinets for RH450 and other bass amplifiers: RS112(1x12\\" speakers) RS210(2x10\\" speakers), RS212(2 x 12\\" speakers) and RS410(4 x 10\\" speakers). Also, shortly after presenting the RH450 at NAMM'09, TC Electronic engaged a pilot program,http://www.tcelectronic.com/testpilot.asp - Test Pilot section on TC Electronics's official web site selecting 24 bassists worldwide to test the amplifier at concerts and rehearsals. = PowerCore = PowerCore is a series of computer hardware and software, somewhat similar in concept to the DSP card in Digidesign's Pro Tools. At the base is a PowerCore unit that runs PowerCore VST or AU plug-ins. TC Electronic discontinued the PowerCore line in early 2011. = Studio equipment = TC Electronic produces equalizers, microphone preamplifiers, compressors, level maximizers, and multi-effect units (such as FireworX). FireworX FireworX is a multi-effects processor. Producers and DJs, such as Sasha, use or used Fireworx in conjunction with CD players for live performances. Fireworx won best Hardware Signal Processing Technology at the 1998 TEC Awards. The unit itself incorporates effects such as distortion, compression, noise and curve generators, ring modulation, vocoding, parametric equalizers, tremolo, reverb and delay. The effects can be routed in a large variety of ways, and it is possible to modify different parameters. = PA, installation and broadcasting products = TC Electronic also produces equalizers for live use, gain maximizers, loudness controllers, and several products that reduce loudness variations during broadcasting. TC Electronic also has been a partner in developing loudness standardisation work with international standards bodies such as the ITU, ATSC and EBU. = Software = TC Electronic develops a range of plug-ins for its PowerCore system. They are all in the VST or AU formats, but cannot run without the PowerCore hardware. Some of these plug-ins are included with all of the PowerCore systems, except PowerCore Unplugged. The plugins include equalizers, noise removal plugins, reverbs, analog filter banks emulators, compressors and psychoacoustic effects. TC Electronic also authors plug-ins for the HD version of Digidesign's Pro Tools and Soundscape software. These plug-ins are also available in a PowerCore version (some of them are ported from the System 6000). They include vocal harmonisers, mastering plugins, reverbs and compressors. Spark audio editor TC Electronic also developed a two- track digital audio editor, which featured mastering tools and different effects.

The Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences provides about 38 study programmes in architecture and civil engineering, business and business law, informatics and engineering, social work and health. It has an international student body, with about 12,000 students coming from more than 100 countries. About 250 professors and over a 1000 other employees work at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. It has four faculties: Architecture and civil engineering; Informatics and engineering; Business and law; and Social work and health. Most courses are taught in German; however, Master courses in English are provided in High Integrity Systems, Information Technology, and Urban development. A well-known alumni of the university is Gerhard Schulmeyer. Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences is part of the IT-Cluster Rhine-Main- Neckar, the \\"Silicon Valley of Europe\\". History The earliest predecessor of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, the \\"K√∂nigliche Baugewerkschule\\" was founded in 1908, and the \\"Royal College of Mechanical Engineering\\" was founded in 1910. The Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main was created on 1 August 1971 by integrating various predecessor institutions, including the Higher School of Social Work, the State Higher Economic School (HWS), and engineering schools. The Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main was renamed to Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences on 1 July 2014. By July 2001, the university consisted of thirteen departments. Four departments, Architecture, Civil Engineering, Geodesy, and Surveying, were part of the original Royal Baugewerkschule, founded in 1908 for civil engineering. Four more departments, Electrical Engineering, Precision Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Process Technology were part of the State united engineering schools, founded in 1920. The department of Social pedagogy was founded in 1954 as part of the urban Jugendleiterinnenseminar, and the Department of Social Work goes back to the State-recognized women's school for Volkspflege founded in 1944. The Department of Economics was founded in 1966 and originated with the state higher Wirtschaftsfachschule. The Data Processing and Social and Cultural Studies departments had been first created as part of the FH in 1971 and were originally service departments created for the students of engineering disciplines. The final department, Healthcare, was added in 1993. From 1995 to 1998, these departments were spread over two locations. Social pedagogy, Social work, Nursing, and Business were situated at Nordweststadt; the others were operated from Nibelungenplatz, at Kleiststrasse in the old building of the \\"State School\\" and in the old \\"engineering school\\". In July 2001 it was decided to combine the then thirteen departments into four subject areas. In September 2005 The Presidents of the University of Applied Sciences of Frankfurt and the Wiesbaden University of Applied Sciences agreed to a strategic partnership of the two Universities of Applied Sciences of Frankfurt and Wiesbaden. This was due to the changes in the German higher education system (Bachelor / Master) and thereby increasing competition between colleges, universities, and vocational colleges. On 14 September 2007 a steering group was set up by the President by issuing a paper for the merger of the two Universities of Applied Sciences as Hochschule Rhein-Main ‚Äì University of Applied Sciences. However, on 12 December 2007, the merger was rejected by the Senate of the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt am Main, although it had already been approved by the Senate of the Wiesbaden University of Applied Sciences. =Presidents= # 1971‚Äì1982 Johannes Uthoff # 1983‚Äì1986 Rolf Kessler # 1987‚Äì1994 Johannes Schneider # 1995‚Äì2002 Rolf Kessler # 2003‚Äì2008 Wolf Rieck # 2008‚Äì2014 Detlev Buchholz # 2014‚Äìpresent Frank Dievernich International orientation The Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences is located in an urban area and its 10,000 students are drawn from about 100 nations.

It is northwest of London and west of Wolverhampton. It is north of Bridgnorth and southeast of Telford. The parish, which include the hamlet of Chesterton, is an extensive one which lies on the River Worfe. The name Worfield comes from its location on the river Worfe and the surrounding countryside (fields). The manor of Worfield is mentioned in Domesday Book, where it formed part of the Seisdon Hundred of Staffordshire and was held by Hugh Montgomery, later 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury. History The earliest evidence of settlement that is recorded in the Parish is not in Worfield itself but at Chesterton, which today is a hamlet to the east of the village The people living in the Parish between 600BC and 47AD were part of the Celtic tribe, Cornovii. The economy of the Parish started with the Cornovii tribe and was based on agriculture, breeding and trading cattle. The area also gained considerable wealth from controlling the South Cheshire salt-making industry. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north to Kemberton. the total population of the ward taken at the 2011 Census was 3,711. Places of interest=Davenport House= Davenport House is a grade 1 listed building dating back to 1726. It was built by the Architect, Francis Smith of Warwick for Henry Davenport. It is now used for events such as weddings,conferences and private Parties. It is located in the centre of Worfield, Bridgnorth, Shropshire. =Golf club= Worfield Golf Club has a modern 18 hole course in the Shropshire countryside. The course opened in 1991 and has been continuously developed since then. The course allows play all year round and trolleys or buggies can be used most of the year. The club co- hosted the English Men's Senior Championship in 1999. =The Old Vicarage Hotel and Restaurant= The Old Vicarage Hotel and Restaurant is located near to Bridgnorth, it is midway between Wolverhampton and Telford only being 1 mile away from the A454 ‚Äì Wolverhampton to Bridgnorth Road and 2 miles from the A442 ‚Äì Bridgnorth to Telford Road The Hotel itself has 14 bedrooms and the restaurant at the Old Vicarage is one of the only two restaurants in Shropshire that have three AA rosettes for dining and three red stars. The Inn at Shipley is located in a three-storey Georgian building from 1771, 3.5 miles away from The Old Vicarage and is part of the Brunning and Price chain. St Peter's Church Church of St Peter the Apostle, pictured from the church gate, to the south. St. Peter's church is thought to be of Saxon origin and founded by Mercian Earl, Leofric, certainly existing since the 12th Century. The church is perhaps best known for its fine spire, which at one stage was seriously deteriorating along with the six church bells in the tower that were deemed too dangerous to ring. A huge amount of fundraising took place to restore the spire and bells to their present-day condition. Although there have been changes to the church over the centuries some of its original features still remain. The original wooden doors leading into the church date back to the 12th Century. These doors are historically important as they are the earliest evidence of the use of ironwork for decoration. The doors in St Peter's Church are one of the only five picture doors left in England.\\"St Peter's Worfield\\" The most prominent features of the interior are the Bromley tombs. The earliest was built for George Bromley, a prominent judge of the Elizabethan period and brother of Thomas Bromley, the Lord Chancellor. He acquired property through marriage to Joan Waverton, heiress to the Hallon estate, to the west of Worfield. The later and more impressive tomb was built for their second son, Edward Bromley, another important judge who was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer and is portrayed in judicial dress. There are a variety of war memorials inside the church: *Shield-shaped metal and wood plaque to a man who died of fever serving in the 1885 Egyptian campaign and two men who died in the Boer War. *Brass tablet to four Old Boys of the former Worfield Grammar School killed in the Boer War, incorporating image of a chalice to represent one the school additionally donated to the church. *Wall tablet to Second Lieutenant Eden Marindin, KSLI, died of wounds in World War I. *Brass wall tablet to Major Frank Harvey Corbett, Royal Field Artillery, killed in World War I, with his battlefield grave marker cross removed from his burial place in France. *Stone plaque with marble surround to men of the parish who died serving in World War I. *Stone plaque to those who died in World War II.

It defines infrastructure common to most desktop applications, making Swing applications easier to create. It has now been withdrawn.http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=296 Features The JSR 296 specification defines the basic structure of a Swing application. It defines a framework as a small set of extensible classes that define infrastructure common to most desktop applications: * management of application life-cycle, startup and shutdown; * support for loading localized resources; * persistent session state; * support for loosely coupling actions to their presentation. Status and roadmap Development of an open-source Reference Implementation called \\"appframework\\" began in 2006. It was originally expected that this implementation would be the means for integrating JSR 296 into the upcoming Java SE 7 (Dolphin) version of Java, and the project was scheduled to be included in milestone 5 of the Java Development Kit JDK7 development. However, in August 2009, it was announced that the project would not be included, due to an inability to reconcile design flaws and achieve consensus among the JSR 296 team before the milestone 5 deadline. The original Swing Application Framework implementation has been put on hold indefinitely. It was later withdrawn at the Spec Lead's request in June 2011. The last public release of the appframework project was version 1.03. Forks and alternatives Several forks of the original implementation have been started by open-source communities, and several other application framework libraries have been created to achieve goals similar to those of JSR 296. ;Better Swing Application Framework :The Better Swing Application Framework project, or BSAF, is a fork of version 1.03 of the original appframework project. BSAF was created at Project Kenai in September 2009 and is currently the most active of the forks. Its goals are to eliminate bugs and execute small design fixes on the original appframework implementation while maintaining compatibility with version 1.03. Last release BSAF 1.9.1 was 2012. BSAF is still available at SourceForge, which has a button that says \\"This project can now be found here,\\" that takes you to the now defunct project Kenai. ;Guice Utilities & Tools Set :The Guice Utilities & Tools Set, or GUTS, is an implementation of JSR 296 that combines the appframework with the Google Guice Dependency Injection library. Like BSAF, it is also hosted at Project Kenai. Unlike BSAF, GUTS is making a break-away from the \\"problematic singleton\\" pattern. This project began in June 2009, and is currently not active (version 0.1 stuck 2010). ;Swing Application Framework Fork :The Swing Application Framework Fork, or SAFF, is a fork of appframework 1.03. It is currently hosted at GitHub. However, this project has been dormant since October 2009. ;TreasureMap :TreasureMap is a library providing standalone use of appframework 1.03's ResourceMap implementation. ;NetBeans Platform :The NetBeans Platform is a robust Swing application framework, with many more features, as well as much more documentation. Because of the JSR failure/hold, SAF has been removed from Netbeans as of version 7.1. The developers seem to have no desire to provide any alternative, and suggest that the Netbeans platform is the right mechanism for porting SAF projects to a supported platform. ;Eclipse RCP :Eclipse RCP is a big SWT (an alternative to Swing) application framework, for bigger projects, needs more time for understanding. ;jGAF - Java Generic Application Framework :jGAF is a simple and compact library to quickly build full-featured Java Swing Application. This free open- source framework provides APIs to handle application life cycle, menus, configuration, OS integration, application data persistence, application protection, wizards, preferences, etc. See also *swingLabs External links * JSR website * Framework overview * appframework the open-source reference implementation for JSR 296 * Source Forge BSAF Page References Category:Java specification requests ","title":"Swing Application Framework"},{"id":"10402410","text":"Yakov Kazyansky Yakov Kazyansky (; born Kuybyshev, 30 August 1948) is a Russian musician.

The son of Caesarean Section pioneer Prof Murdoch Cameron, S.J. Cameron was a foundation Fellow of Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1929, and for many years a member of the Gynaecological Visiting Society. A lifelong champion of the reputation of the founder of professional midwifery in the British isles, William Smellie, Cameron both named a maternity hospital at Lanark, Scotland, after him and saved Smellie's library from permanent loss. Professional life Sam Cameron graduated from the University of Glasgow MB Ch.B, with commendation, in 1901. Among his professional appointments he spent a year as house-surgeon at the Chelsea Hospital for Woman, in London, working under the pre-eminent British surgeons, Sir John Bland-Sutton, Victor Bonney and Sir Comyns Berkeley, forming enduring friendships with all three. Later he became head of the gynaecological wards at Glasgow's Western Infirmary and in 1920 was appointed head of a gynaecological unit at the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. In October 1934 he succeeded to his father's former position, replacing John Martin Munro Kerr in the chair of Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow. A popular teacher, Cameron was famous for his notably quick surgical technique. He published four medical textbooks, including A Manuel of Gynaecology: For Students and Practitioners (1915). After his retirement in 1942 Cameron was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Glasgow. William Smellie Throughout his professional life Cameron championed the reputation of the father of modern midwifery in the British isles, William Smellie. In October 1956 he gave the first William Smellie lecture to the Glasgow Obstetrical Society having previously led the campaign for the renovation of Smellie's tomb and having played the decisive role in the efforts to salvage Smellie's library at Lanark. In 1929, in his Presidential address to the Glasgow Obstetric and Gynaecological Society Cameron said of Smellie: ‚ÄòLooking backwards, I see Smellie‚Äôs figure towering above all other‚Äôs [‚Ä¶] As the founder of the modern practice of obstetrics, this plain, blunt, and indefatigable Scot has left a memory, to be cherished by all interested in this special department of medicine‚Äô. In honour of the plain and indefatigable Scot Cameron, instrumental in the foundation of a maternity hospital at Lanark, named it the William Smellie Memorial Hospital. Personal life A lifelong art collector, Sam Cameron's collection at his country residence at Stobieside, near Drumclog, Lanarkshire included works by the Scottish painters Allan Ramsay and Sir Henry Raeburn. Cameron also commissioned Denis Peploe, son of the Scottish painter, S.J. Peploe, to sculpt a statue of mother and child, which he gave to the William Smellie Memorial Hospital. In 1908 S.J. Cameron married Marion Lean, daughter of Daniel Lean the wealthy Scots muslin manufacturer, the value of whose estate ranked him fifth in the top ten wealthiest Scots to die in 1898. Samuel James Cameron died at Stobieside in 1959.

Klein, an eclectic, was one of the most prolific architects of his period, second only to Fyodor Schechtel. In the 1880s-1890s, he practiced Russian Revival and Neo-Gothic exteriors; in the 1900s, his knowledge of Roman and Byzantine classical architecture allowed him to integrate into the Neoclassical revival trend of that period. Biography=Education= Roman Klein was born in Moscow into a German merchant family of Ivan Makarovich Klein.Germans of Russia ‚Äî Encyclopedia. Volume 2: K-O // article by V. Bem, page 107. ‚Äî Moscow: Public Academy of Science of Russian Germans, 2004. ‚Äî 747 pages. He trained at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1873‚Äì1874), with Vladimir Sherwood on the construction site of State Historical Museum (1875‚Äì1877), and at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1877‚Äì1882), winning a study tour to Italy and France (1883‚Äì1884), where he assisted Charles Garnier in preparation to the Exposition Universelle (1889). Klein returned to Moscow in 1885, worked as junior architect at local firms and went independent in 1888. =Pushkin Museum= Pushkin Museum, 1896-1912 Most of Klein's professional career revolved around the 16-year Pushkin Museum project. The public contest of 1896, managed by Moscow State University, awarded first prize to Pyotr Boytsov; Klein used Boytsov's general layout but the exterior and interior styling is Klein's own, undisputed work. His knowledge of Greek and Byzantine classics was evident, however, the University also wanted perfection in other historical interiors (Egyptian, Babylonian) and sent Klein on two overseas study tours (1897, 1899‚Äì1900). Klein had studied the latest forms of museum construction in Europe, and he built a temple to the arts that expressed civic pride and private patronage, thus pleasing his benefactor, Nechaev-Maltsov, and creating what Lukomskii would have called approvingly a \\"European\\" building, noticeably different from the public and commercial buildings whose neoclassicism derived from the local Empire style. Klein employed Vladimir Shukhov for structural engineering of ceilings and sunroofs, Ivan Rerberg and other younger architects. The museum was generally complete by 1907; finishing works and expansions lasted to 1912. =Commercial success= TsUM Department Store Klein was in high demand among Moscow businessmen expanding their retail and warehouse facilities. He completed such high-profile buildings like Neo- Gothic TsUM department store (1906‚Äì1908, originally, Muir & Mirrielees store) in Petrovka Street and pseudo-Russian Middle Trade Rows in Kitai-gorod (1901‚Äì1902). Klein also completed a number of banks and office blocks in Kitai-gorod and other districts of Moscow. Less known is his prodigious input to industrial architecture; Klein was the house architect for Moscow industrialists like Giroud, Huebner (textile and rubber mills in Khamovniki District) and Gougon (steel mills in Lefortovo District). His lesser customers ranged from country farms and breweries to Moscow' first aircraft plant (Khrunichev). Most of these buildings, with few exceptions, were later rebuilt or demolished. Klein contributed to the Devichye Pole campus project, building the Cancer Clinic, Gynaecology Clinic and student dormitories in 1896-1903; his own house and rental apartment building were located in nearby Olsufyevsky Lane. He designed numerous Orthodox, Lutheran and Catholic churches in Moscow and other cities and supervised construction of Moscow Choral Synagogue (designed by Semyon Eybushits). As a private architect to Shelaputin family, he completed various Shelaputin Schools (for general and professional education). =Critical assessment= Nekrasov House, 20 Khlebny Lane Modern critics place Klein's talent below his contemporaries like Fyodor Schechtel or Lev Kekushev (Maria Naschokina, p. 255). All his work belong to eclecticism, which was normal for 1880s but completely outdated by the 1900s. This may be interpreted as either loyalty to his personal style, or as inability to follow the novel trends of his period. Klein had his limitations, but his immense academic background and drawing skills allowed him to imitate styles like Victorian architecture or Russian Revival. His buildings like Nekrasov House are sometimes listed as Art Nouveau, but Klein actually did not venture into this style. After 1905, when public discarded Art Nouveau, his neoclassical skills put him in the middle of Neoclassical Revival of 1905-1914. =Educator and preservationist= Shelaputin School for the Women, 15-17 Leninsky Prospect - one of many Shelaputin Schools built by Klein Klein, a successful businessman, possessed excellent skills in educating and managing people. His architectural firm trained dozens of architects who excelled in Art Nouveau (Yevlanov brothers), industrial architecture (Karl Gippius), Neoclassical revival (Ivan Rerberg) and later constructivist architecture (Grigory Barkhin). Klein treated these internships as his own educational work, not just hiring labor. He advocated \\"finding out the unique, individual features of a trainee architect, and bringing up his own creative conscience\\" (\\"–≤—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–Ω–¥–∏–≤–∏–¥—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ ... –∏ –≤ –≤–æ—Å–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≤ –Ω–µ–º —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–∞–º–æ—Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è\\", Maria Naschokina, p. 257), and promoted the French model of architectural workshops. In the 1900s, Klein was active in preservationism movement, performing surveys of historical buildings (notably, Domenico Giliardi's University building); publication of his books about these studies was interrupted by World War I. Unlike other architects of his generation, Klein easily integrated into the Soviet reality of Civil War period - he retained his formal employment as an architect of Historical and Pushkin Museums and the chair at Moscow State Technical University and even received practical (but unimportant) commissions in 1922-1923. He took part in the architectural competitions of the early 1920s, side by side with the new generation of avant-garde architects. Roman Klein died in 1924 and is interred at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Lefortovo District.

It is the only species in the genus Alphaarterivirus, and that is the only genus in the Equarterivirinae subfamily. The virus which causes EVA was first isolated in 1953, but the disease has afflicted equine animals worldwide for centuries. It has been more common in some breeds of horses in the United States, but there is no breed \\"immunity\\". In the UK, it is a notifiable disease. There is no known human hazard. Signs The signs shown depend on the horse's age, the strain of the infecting virus, the condition of the horse and the route by which it was infected. Most horses with EVA infection do not show any signs; if a horse does show signs, these can vary greatly in severity. Following infection, the first sign is fever, peaking at , followed by various signs such as lethargy, nasal discharge, \\"pink eye\\" (conjunctivitis), swelling over the eye (supraorbital edema), urticaria, and swelling of the limbs and under the belly (the ventral abdomen) which may extend to the udder in mares or the scrotum of male horses. More unusual signs include spontaneous abortion in pregnant mares, and, most likely in foals, severe respiratory distress and death. Cause EVA is caused by an arterivirus called equine arteritis virus (EAV). Arteriviruses are small, enveloped, animal viruses with an icosahedral core containing a positive-sense RNA genome. As well as equine arteritis virus the Arterivirus family includes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). There are a number of routes of transmission of the virus. The most frequent is the respiratory route. Virions can also be shed into the semen, and the disease has been spread by artificial insemination. Stallions may become carriers. Diagnosis Because of the variability of symptoms, diagnosis is by laboratory testing. Blood samples, nasal swabs and semen can be used for isolation of the virus, detection of the viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and detection of antibodies by ELISA tests. Prevention A vaccine is available in the UK and Europe, however in laboratory tests it is not possible to distinguish between antibodies produced as a result of vaccination and those produced in response to infection with the virus. Management also plays an important part in the prevention of EVA. Research Zinc ionophores show antiviral activity against Equine viral arteritis. History The virus causing EVA was first identified following an outbreak of respiratory disease and spontaneous abortion on a horse farm in Ohio in 1953. The first outbreak of EVA in the UK was in 1993. The outbreak affected six premises and around 100 horses were infected. Further spread of the virus was prevented by movement restrictions.

Meanwhile, Daisy gets annoyed when Lily is given time off to go shopping by Mr Hudson. A few days later, while at the Wembley Exhibition, Georgina spots Hudson and Lily together holding hands. That evening she tells Virginia what she saw, and Virginia then asks Rose if Lily is seeing any one. Rose says she knows nothing, but then goes to see Lily and asks her if she is going out with Mr Hudson. Lily confirms this and tells Rose how he has taken her to concerts and museums. Very soon the whole house knows what has been going on. Hudson explains to Mrs Bridges that Lily brings him hope and joy, and he tells Virginia that he has \\"very deep feelings\\" for her. Mrs Bridges is upset, as they had said that one day they would marry themselves. Hudson soon decides to resign and gives four weeks notice. Hudson wants to go with Lily on Sunday to see her mother in Banbury to ask for Lily's hand in marriage, however Lily can not bring herself to tell him that she does not love him. On the Sunday morning, having spoken to Georgina, Lily talks to Hudson, and hurts him by saying insulting things, including calling him boring. The following morning, Lily leaves 165, Eaton Place without telling anyone and goes back to live with her mother. She leaves a note for Mr Hudson, explaining she did not mean the hurtful things she said the day before, she only wanted to stop him caring for her. Hudson then withdraws his resignation, and Virginia writes a very good reference for Lily.

On their way to the mainstream success, they have to face with the violence near their homes and the sexism of the musical business. The film was directed by Tata Amaral and stars Negra Li, Cindy Mendes, Leilah Moreno and Quelynah as the members of the group. It was shot in Santo Andr√©, S√£o Paulo. The film had its European premiere January 26, 2007 at the 36th Rotterdam International Film Festival, in the section \\"Cinema of the World: Time & Tide\\". It was released commercially in the United States on September 21, 2007, in New York City, New York; Newark, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, California. The movie, spun off from a 2006 short by Amaral, in turn spun off a television series from 02 Filmes and Rede Globo in the filmmaker's native Brazil, starring the same actors in the same roles.Box Office (Sept. 21, 2007): Review by Tim Cogshell Plot On Vila Brasil√¢ndia, a favela (shanty town) of S√£o Paulo, four Afro-Brazilian girls battle to fulfill their dream of making a living off their music. Friends since the childhood, Preta (Negra Li), B√°rbarah (Leilah Moreno), Mayah (Quelynah) and Lena (Cindy Mendes, a.k.a. Maria Madalena, as Cindy) quit singing the backing vocals for a male rap group and form Ant√¥nia, their own group. Discovered by the smooth-talking manager Marcelo Diamante (Tha√≠de), they begin to sing rap, MPB, pop and soul in bars and in middle-class parties. Preta is the deep-voiced mother of a young daughter, Em√≠lia (Nathalye Cris). Mayah is the most sexually provocative though single and the high-voiced Lena lives alone with her boyfriend. B√°rbarah is the sister of Duda (Chico Santo), an athletic young man with whom she frequently practices martial arts. Duda's exposed homosexuality brings a rising action into the story in which his gay partner is killed by a gang and Duda himself injured. Duda, however, recovers; despite this sudden crisis, the future begins to look bright again as the band Ant√¥nia begins to take flight. Just when the dream of the quartet seems to becoming true, their hopes are dashed by daily events, such as poverty, male oppression, and further street violence, which threaten the group and place the young women's friendship in jeopardy. The conflict begins when Mayah flirts with Preta's estranged husband Ermano (Fernando Mac√°rio), and Preta forces Mayah out of the group, deciding to raise Em√≠lia by herself with the help of her parents. Next, Lena reveals that she is pregnant and must quit the group after her boyfriend, who originally wanted an abortion, puts pressure on her to do so if they are to raise the child. B√°rbarah, meanwhile, is walking home one night with Preta when she is confronted and harassed by a young member of the same gang who attacked her brother; she defends herself using martial arts, throwing him heavily to the ground and resulting in his hospitalization. The boy dies in the hospital and B√°rbarah is arrested and imprisoned for manslaughter. Preta, who struggles with her own personal troubles and the strain of raising her child alone, is the final member of Ant√¥nia left. At last unable to feel any desire to continue the group or rise to fame (as Marcelo encourages) if her friends cannot be with her, she goes to Mayah's house to apologize and reconcile. They, along with Lena, visit a grateful, teary-eyed B√°rbarah in prison; they decide to spend their time with her writing a song about their experiences. The scene changes to some point in the future in which all four members of Ant√¥nia are back together, singing onstage a liberation-themed song, Ant√¥nia. Cast The cast includes real-life Brazilian rap singers Negra Li and Thaide; black-music singer Leilah Moreno; actress, MC, and free style rapper Cindy, and rapper-dancer Quelynah. Appearing in one scene each, as Preta's parents, are Sandra de S√°, \\"the leading lady of Brazilian funk\\", and Thobias da Vai-Vai, a leading samba performer. *Preta - Negra Li *Lena - Cindy Mendes, a.k.a.

Like Siegfried Sassoon, Schuster was of Jewish descent. In 1924, knowing that Sassoon was suffering from depression, Schuster made him the gift of his first car. He also allowed Sassoon to stay at his popular country retreat, \\"The Hut\\", opposite Monkey Island at Bray-on-Thames, but the two were never lovers. Edward Elgar statue, Hereford Schuster also had many heterosexual friends. He was a close friend and travelling companion of composer Edward Elgar, and helped foster Elgar's popularity in the years leading up to World War I. It was at \\"The Hut\\" that Elgar partially wrote his First Symphony, Violin Concerto and the symphonic study Falstaff. Elgar dedicated his concert- overture \\"In the South (Alassio)\\", completed in 1904, to Schuster. Schuster was highly involved in organising the three-day Elgar Festival at Covent Garden in 1904, which was an unprecedented tribute to a living composer. Adrian Boult and Edward Elgar first met at Schuster's house in 1905. He was also a patron of Gabriel Faur√©, and was responsible for introducing Faur√© and Elgar to each other. One of the stories retold by The Spectator when it moved into 22 Queen Street in 2007: > Boult liked to tell of how Schuster's sense of humour landed him in trouble > with the ballad-singer Kennerley Rumford, with whom he had been at school. > Joining in the craze for bicycling ‚Äî embraced by both Elgar and Mahler ‚Äî > they went out for a ride and Rumford said he had decided to give his bicycle > a name.

Although it is one of Georgia's smallest towns, The 2002 Census results , p. 47 (PDF format). The Statistics Department of Georgia. Retrieved on April 1, 2007. Signagi serves as a popular tourist destination due to its location at the heart of Georgia's wine-growing regions, as well as its picturesque landscapes, pastel houses and narrow, cobblestone streets. Located on a steep hill, Signagi overlooks the vast Alazani Valley, with the Caucasus Mountains visible at a distance.  Etymology  The name of the town comes from Old Turkic word of ' (, ), meaning \\"shelter\\" or \\"asylum\\".  History  Signagi is located in the Kakheti region of Georgia, first settled in the Paleolithic period. Throughout its history Signagi or Sighnaghi was known to the local population as Kambechovani, and later as Kisikhi or Kisiki. The word Sighnaghi in the Turkic language means shelter or trench. Signagi as a settlement was first recorded in the early 18th century. In 1762, King Heraclius II of Georgia sponsored the construction of the town and erected a fortress to defend the area from marauding attacks by Dagestani tribesmen. According to the 1770 census, 100 families, chiefly craftsmen and merchants, lived in Signagi. When Georgia was annexed by Imperial Russia in 1801, Signagi (Signakh) was officially granted town status and became a centre of the Signakh uyezd () within the Tiflis Governorate in 1802. In 1812, Signakh joined the rebellion with the rest of Kakheti against Russian rule. During the Caucasian War, the town \\"was considered an important point on account of its proximity to\\" Dagestan. The town quickly grew in size and population and became an agricultural center in the Soviet Union. The severe economic crisis in post-Soviet Georgia heavily affected the town, but a major reconstruction project recently launched by the Government of Georgia and co-funded by several international organizations intends to both address an increasing tourist interest and modernize infrastructure.The official website of Signagi .

After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was signed and strong Soviet support was given to China by the Soviet Union, including the volunteer squadrons. China paid for the support in the form of raw materials. Background In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent worldwide economic crisis, the Empire of Japan pursued an expansionist policy against its weakened neighbors in the Far East. On 18 September 1931, Japan staged the Mukden Incident using it as a pretext for its invasion of Chinese Manchuria. Japan went on to transform the north‚Äìeast of China into a puppet state under the name of Manchukuo. In the plans of the Japanese general staff, Manchukuo was to serve as a stepping stone for the future conquest of the rest of China. Facing increasing pressure China strengthened its ties with Germany. Starting from 1933, a German mission headed by Hans von Seeckt provided crucial military support to the government of Chiang Kai-shek, reorganizing the army and providing training and modern arms. German aid began to wane in 1937 and was cut completely in May 1938, as Adolf Hitler realigned himself with Japan and Manchukuo instead. Sino‚ÄìSoviet diplomatic ties had been cut following the Sino-Soviet conflict (1929). At the time the Soviet Union was undergoing a country wide program of mass industrialization in preparation for a potential war on two fronts (with Germany and Japan respectively). The establishment of Manchukuo complicated the situation as its territory now housed a colony of 40,000 Soviet citizens working on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Although the Soviets refused to officially recognize the new state, they sold the railway to the Japanese in March 1935, at a cut-rate following a series of Japanese provocations. The Soviets felt unready for a new confrontation with Japan, opting to improve relations with China as a temporary countermeasure. The League of Nations remained silent on the issue of Japanese imperialism, pushing China to reactivate its unofficial communication channels with its only remaining potential ally. The Anti-Comintern Pact, signed on 25 November 1936, erased the last doubts held by both sides regarding the ongoing reconciliation efforts. On 7 July 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 21 August, China and the Soviet Union signed a non‚Äìaggression pact. Although the pact made no mention of Soviet military support, it de facto established a tacit understanding that the Soviets would provide both military and material aid. In September 1937, a secret decree issued by the Soviet Orgburo ordered that 225 aircraft, including 62 Polikarpov I-15, 93 Polikarpov I-16 and 8 Yakovlev UT-4 trainers, be sent to China. In March and July 1938 as well as in July 1939, China received loans of 50, 50 and 150 million $ respectively, with an annual interest of 3%. The loans were to be repaid through exports of tea, wool, leather and metals. Upon a Chinese request the Soviets also agreed to provide military advisors and volunteer pilots. The first group of military advisors arrived in China in early June 1938. By February 1939, 3665 Soviet military specialists headed by Mikhail Dratvin had been deployed. Operation Polikarpov I-16 with Chinese insignia. I-16 was the main fighter plane used by the Chinese Air Force and Soviet volunteers. In October 1937, some 450 Soviet pilots and technicians assembled in Moscow, subsequently traveling to Alma Ata to bring 155 fighter aircraft, 62 bombers, and 8 trainers into China. The Soviets arrived as private citizens and initially wore civilian clothing, the mission remaining a secret even from their closest relatives. They were instructed to avoid using the term comrade, and in the event of their capture they were to claim that they were former members of the White movement permanently residing in China. Prior to each mission, the pilots changed into Chinese uniforms, whilst their planes were marked with Chinese Air Force insignia. By 1941, the Soviet-built aircraft sent to China would amount to 885, including two-engine and four-engine bombers, though the latter were never used in combat. Apart from the aforementioned I-15, I-16 and UT-4, the Soviets also supplied Tupolev TB-3, Tupolev SB, and Ilyushin DB-3 bombers. Over 1,200 aircraft had been sent to China by the end of 1941. At the time of the arrival of the first Soviet volunteers, the Chinese Air Force had been reduced to less than 100 serviceable aircraft. These were machines so outdated that the Soviets described them as a \\"museum of antiquity\\", and were manned by less than 600 men. Morale was low and the improvement of the situation was hampered by corrupt officials who bought outdated foreign equipment in return for bribes. The Japanese outnumbered the Chinese in the air by a 13:1 ratio and were better trained. Moreover, the Japanese aircraft were faster and equipped with such novelties as night vision devices and radios, easily outmaneuvering and overpowering any opposition. Japanese aircraft engineers examine a captured Soviet I-16 fighter. Although the personnel were briefed on the situation in China and the importance of their participation in the fight against Japan, they were not volunteers; Soviet Air Force commander Aleksandr Loktionov and his deputy Yakov Smushkevich selected the personnel for the Soviet Volunteer Group. At its peak the Soviet Volunteer Group numbered 3,665 personnel, including doctors, drivers, mechanics, meteorologists, cryptographers, radio operators, airfield managers and pilots. 2,000 of these were pilots and 1,000 took part in combat missions. Some of them had been sent directly from the front lines of the Spanish Civil War where the Soviets also had a sizeable military mission. Of the aircraft supplied, half were turned over to the Chinese Air Force and half were flown and maintained by Soviet personnel. The Soviet air units were stationed at bases near the cities of Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing, and at Lanzhou in China's northwest at the terminus of the Soviet supply route. On 13 December 1937, the former temporary capital of Nanjing fell to the Japanese, turning the aerodrome of Xiangyang into the main Soviet base. 200 Soviet pilots took part in the defense of the new capital, Hankou, flying in mixed squadrons along with Chinese pilots. On 23 February 1938, the Soviet Volunteer Group conducted its first operation outside Chinese borders, with 12 and 28 bombers departing from Nanjing and Hankou, respectively. The target was the island of Taiwan, the main base of the Japanese Air Force, which also housed a wide array of cargo ships containing fuel and spare parts intended for the base. Flying at high attitude and approaching the island from the north, the bombers remained undetected until they dropped their payload, safely returning. As a result of the raid the Japanese lost a large shipment of fuel, 40 aircraft were destroyed on the ground, port facilities and hangars were destroyed while several ships sustained minor damages. On 28 April, the Japanese launched a massive air raid on the Wuhan military airport with the intent of celebrating the birthday of emperor Hirohito. At 10:00 a.m. they were met by 60 Soviet I-15 and I-16 fighters. In the largest air battle at that point of the war the Japanese lost 21 aircraft, while Soviet losses were limited to 2. Among those killed was Soviet pilot Lev Shuster, who performed an aerial ramming after running out of fuel and ammunition. On 31 May, 18 Japanese bombers approached Wuhan for a second time, covered by 36 fighters. At the conclusion of the fight, the Japanese bombers missed their targets and 14 of them were shot down by Soviet fighters. By May, Soviet pilots had destroyed 625 enemy aircraft and damaged 150 military and civilian ships. The Soviet squadrons were withdrawn after the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in 1939. As a result, the Chinese turned to the United States, which authorized the creation of the American Volunteer Group Flying Tigers. Monuments Monument to the Soviet aviators in Wuhan Distinguished pilots who fought in the unit include Pavel Rychagov, Timofey Khryukin, Stepan Suprun, Grigory Kravchenko, Konstantin Kokkinaki, Georgi Zakharov, Grigory Tkhor and Pavel Zhigarev. Between 1937 and 1940, a total of 236 Soviet pilots were killed in action or in accidents. There are a total of 70 monuments to the Soviet aviators in China. The most notable of which being Jiefang Gongyuan (Liberation Park) in Wuhan, which was built in 1956 and houses the remains of 15 Soviet pilots. The Liberation Park Memorial was renovated in 2008.

It was a single- seat, single-engine monoplane of all-metal cantilever construction; the undercarriage was of the tailwheel type with retractable main wheels. The aircraft was developed for Air Ministry Specification F.5/34, a fighter armed with eight machine guns and an air-cooled engine that was well-suited to operations in the tropics. The Gloster design was overtaken by more capable competitors and the specification was later abandoned, with none of the aircraft designs produced for it selected for entry into service. Design and development The F.5/34 was the first monoplane fighter built by Gloster and the last design by H.P. Folland for the company. It was also Gloster's first land monoplane. The first design was based on a low-wing monoplane version of the Gladiator, probably retaining the fabric covering and with the fin and full-height rudder behind the tailplane, as for the Gladiator. The engine was to be the new Bristol Perseus sleeve-valve radial. The cockpit was semi- enclosed, with open sides and a spine behind it. The undercarriage retracted backwards and left the wheels half-exposed, which would reduce damage in the event of a wheels-up landing. By 1935, the design had changed and had acquired a number of more modern features such as a metal stressed-skin fuselage throughout. The cockpit canopy was now a glazed and framed canopy like that of the production Gladiator which slid backwards to open, giving much better vision above and behind. Although the main dimensions remained unchanged, the tailplane moved backwards behind the fin, requiring an extension of the fuselage beyond it, increasing the length by 3 feet. This was an innovation developed for the F.35/35 high-speed fighter specification. The intention was to improve spin recovery, by having the fin and rudder in 'clean' air, ahead of the tailplane. The engine also changed, at least for the prototype aircraft, to the older Bristol Mercury poppet-valve engine. The Perseus had been developed with identical cylinder dimensions to the Mercury and was only a little larger, making the change an easy one. The Perseus was still under development and although it was likely that the sleeve valve would, and later did, give much greater scope for development, the Mercury was acceptable for development of the prototype airframe with the Perseus restored later. Powered by an 840 hp Bristol Mercury IX nine-cylinder radial engine, the F.5/34, was informally called the Unnamed Fighter, featured many of the trademark Gloster design elements including the tail and close-fitting cowling that resembled the earlier Gauntlet and Gladiator biplane fighters. The low wing cantilever mainplane was built in one piece with light-alloy spars running through from tip to tip and ribs made from channelling with steel and light-alloy tube struts. NACA 2218 profiles were used at the root and NACA 2209 at the tip. The single piece wing was later criticised as it would have prevented battle damage being repaired by replacing a single wing. Duralumin stressed-skin was used on the mainplane and tail unit with fabric-covered Frise ailerons. The fuselage was a monocoque structure built up from light, fabricated oval- section rings with duralumin skinning. Unlike the usual practice and the single prototypes ordered for the Spitfire and Hurricane, a pair were ordered. Development was delayed by the demands of the Gladiator production programme, so that flight trials of the first prototype K5604 did not commence until December 1936. The second prototype K8089 did not fly until March 1938. Testing In competition with the Gloster for the requirement were the Bristol Type 146, Martin-Baker M.B.2 and the Vickers Venom, which would be tested by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment. Flight magazine (1 July 1937) shows the F.5/34 taking off from Hucclecote Aerodrome and mentions its appearance at the RAF Display of that year. By the time the F.5/34 began its flight tests, the eight-gun Hawker Hurricane was in service and the Supermarine Spitfire in production so that further development of the Gloster fighter was abandoned. Compared to its contemporaries, test pilots found the F.5/34 prototypes had a shorter take off run, offered better initial climb and were more responsive and manoeuvrable due to ailerons that did not become excessively heavy at high speed. Handling was considered very good and the all-round cockpit visibility was far better than the other designs. The Gloster F.5/34 debuted at the 1937 Hendon Air Show but soon after, prototypes K5604 and K8089 were relegated to experimental flying and finally as instructional airframes until May 1941.

It runs from Penzance to Plymouth, crossing from Cornwall into Devon over the famous Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash. It directly serves Truro, St Austell, Bodmin (by a Parkway station), and Liskeard. It forms the backbone for rail services in Cornwall and there are branches off it which serve St Ives, Falmouth, Newquay, and Looe. The main line also carries direct trains to and from London, Birmingham, the north of England and Scotland. It is the southernmost railway line in the United Kingdom, and the westernmost in England. History The Royal Albert Bridge under construction in 1858 The Cornish Main Line was originally built by two separate railway companies, the West Cornwall Railway between Truro and Penzance, opened in 1852, and the Cornwall Railway between Plymouth and a separate station in Truro, opened in 1859. The West Cornwall Railway was itself based on the Hayle Railway, opened in 1837 as a purely local mineral railway. Rail travel from Penzance to London was possible from 1860 when the West Cornwall company was given access to the Cornwall Railway‚Äôs Truro station, but the West Cornwall trains were standard gauge and the Cornwall Railway was broad gauge, so through passengers had to change trains there and goods had to be transhipped into wagons of the other gauge at Truro. The impecunious West Cornwall company sold its railway to the more powerful broad gauge Associated Companies, dominated by the Great Western Railway, and the new owners converted the West Cornwall line to broad gauge. Through goods trains started running in 1866 and passenger trains in 1867. The Associated Companies merged into the Great Western Railway, and in 1892 the Great Western converted all its broad gauge track to standard gauge, a process called the gauge conversion. Both the West Cornwall and the Cornwall railways had been built cheaply and had numerous timber trestle viaducts; these were cheap to build but very expensive to maintain, as the timber decayed, and the iconic viaducts were eventually all reconstructed in masonry or masonry and wrought iron, or in a few cases by-passed. Those on the Cornwall Railway section are described at Cornwall Railway viaducts. The most iconic structure on the route, however, is the Royal Albert Bridge spanning the River Tamar and opened in 1859; it remains in use to the present day. During the later decades of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth, the Great Western Railway was famous for providing transport to holiday destinations in Cornwall, and there were numerous branch lines served from the Cornish main line giving access to the resorts. The physical limitations of the steeply graded line imposed severe problems during the busiest times, not least for goods train operation. Equally famous was the line‚Äôs use for transporting vegetable produce from Cornwall, famously broccoli and cauliflower, and cut flowers from the Isles of Scilly. To cope with the increasing traffic the line was gradually doubled between 1893 and 1930.Railway Magazine October 1963 p. 747 Many of the branch lines were closed during the second half of the twentieth century, but in Cornwall the Looe, Newquay, Falmouth and St Ives branches remain in operation, with a basic local passenger traffic in winter considerably boosted by holidaymakers in summer. The historical development of the line is more fully dealt with at Hayle Railway, West Cornwall Railway, and Cornwall Railway. =Accidents= The Cornwall Main Line has been a very safe railway for passengers, with only a few accidents in the 19th century. These include: * Grove Viaduct, St Germans ‚Äì derailment, 6 May 1859. * St Austell ‚Äì runaway train, 29 October 1872. * Menheniot ‚Äì collision, 2 December 1873. * Bodmin Road ‚Äì derailment, 13 April 1895. Route A train from London Paddington to Penzance crosses Moorswater Viaduct The communities served are: Plymouth (including the suburbs of Devonport and St Budeaux); Saltash; St Germans; Menheniot; Liskeard; Bodmin; Lostwithiel; Par; St Austell; Truro; Redruth; Camborne; Hayle; St Erth; Penzance. In addition branch lines link Plymouth with Bere Alston, Calstock, and Gunnislake; Liskeard with Looe; Par with Newquay; Truro with Penryn and Falmouth; and St Erth with St Ives. The railway stations at St Austell and Penzance are adjacent to bus stations. In addition, integrated bus services operate from Bodmin Parkway to Bodmin, Wadebridge, and Padstow; from St Austell to The Eden Project; and from Redruth to Helston and RNAS Culdrose. The route has a large number of viaducts, but the most significant structure is the Royal Albert Bridge which crosses the River Tamar at Saltash. At Truro the viaducts give sweeping views of the city and River Fal, while further west the north coast can be seen near Hayle before the line swings onto the south coast for the last mile or so along the beach at Marazion, giving a good view of St Michael's Mount. Nominal line speed is but there are local restrictions at many places. The route is mostly double-tracked and cleared for trains up to W7 and W6A gauges. The section of single track from Burngullow to Probus (between the stations at and ) used to be a major cause of delays in the region, requiring trains to wait for preceding trains to clear the singled section before proceeding. The second track was restored in August 2004. The total cost of the project was ¬£14.3 million and was funded by Objective One, Strategic Rail Authority and Cornwall County Council. Usage The number of passengers travelling on the Cornish Main Line has increased in the last few years. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12, with the exception of Keyham and Menheniot, all stations have reported an increase of at least 33% while Hayle, Par, Saltash and St Budeaux Ferry road all reported calculated to be in excess of 200%. The busiest stations are Plymouth, Penzance and Truro which all handle more than one million people arriving or departing each year. St Austell, Redruth and Liskeard all had more than 300,000 people in 2011-12, increases of around 50% or 60% over 2004/05.

A railroad flatcar, which carried the logs, is on the right.The Little River Railroad is a historic class III railroad that operated between Maryville and Elkmont, Tennessee, during the period 1901 to 1939. History The Little River Railroad (\\"the LRR\\") was established as a subsidiary of the Little River Lumber Company on November 21, 1901. Colonel W. B. Townsend was the owner of both entities. The LRR was primarily a logging railroad. The Little River Lumber Company owned over of prime forest land in Blount and Sevier counties. By the time Little River Lumber Company completed operations in 1939, it had harvested two billion board feet (4,700,000 m¬≥) of lumber from the Little River watershed. The LRR typically would build a line into an area, complete the logging, then remove the line. In all, the LRR built of track, none of which remains. The LRR operated several forms of equipment during its lifetime. The primary logging locomotive was the Shay. The LRR also utilized the 4-6-2 Pacific and the first 2-4-4-2 Mallet articulated. In addition, the LRR owned a rail bus and Col. W.B. Townsend utilized a rail car. In 1925 Col. Townsend agreed to deed all of the holdings of the Little River Lumber Company to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for $273,557, or $3.58 an acre. This purchase represented a milestone in the eventual creation of the park. The purchase permitted the Little River Lumber Company to continue logging within the park boundaries until 1938. In 1939 the LRR ended operations. Today, the Little River Lumber Co & Railroad Museum in Townsend, Tennessee, preserves the history of the LRR. Route 70-ton Shay engine at the Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum in Townsend, Tennessee. This particular engine was used in the Tellico area to the west of Tuckaleechee.The LRR had a main line which ran from Maryville, through Walland and Sunshine to Townsend. The line of the LRR roughly follows US 321 and TN 73 today. Townsend was the site of the Little River Lumber Company's sawmill. The main line continued to the confluence of the Little River and the West Prong of the Little River at a spot now known as the Townsend Y. The western branch led to Tremont, where a small logging community was located. The eastern branch led to Elkmont, where a larger logging community and a recreational community were located (see Wonderland Hotel). The LRR roadbed still winds its way along the Little River from Townsend to Elkmont as the Little River Gorge Road or TN 73. Within this section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are numerous trails that owe their existence to the LRR. All of the \\"Quiet Walkways\\" except Bote Mountain Road between Gatlinburg and Cades Cove are former LRR road bed.

Bridgman House is an historic house at 10 Buckingham Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is a National Historic Landmark, notable for its associations with Dr. Percy Williams Bridgman, a physicist, Nobel Prize winner, and Harvard University professor. It is now part of the Buckingham Browne & Nichols (BBN) Lower School campus. The house is an architecturally undistinguished 2 story house built about 1920 in a Neo- Rationalist style. At the time of its designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1975, the house had not been significantly altered since Dr. Bridgman's death in 1961. It was acquired by the BBN School not long after his death, which has used it for a variety of purposes, including as a faculty residence and lounge. and It is used for school offices. Percy Bridgman (1882‚Äì1961) was born in Cambridge, raised in Newton, and educated at Harvard. After receiving his Ph.D. in physics in 1908, he was invited to join the Harvard physics faculty, where he remained for the rest of his life. Bridgman's primary area of research was high pressure physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (the fifth American to be so honored) in 1946 for his development of equipment for advancing research in that field. He also wrote extensively on the epistemology of physics and the sciences, advancing ideas that evolved into the field of operations research during the 1940s. Bridgman moved into this house in 1928, and lived there for the rest of his life.

The Atsuta powered only two models of Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) aircraft in World War II. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) used the same engine (manufactured by Kawasaki as the Kawasaki Ha40) to power its Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien (Allied reporting nameWorld War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft \\"Tony\\") fighter. The IJNAS's Atsuta and its IJAAS cousin, the Ha-40 were based on the engine that powered Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter.Monogram Close-Up 13 Design and development=Aichi receives Daimler-Benz DB 600 license= Daimler-Benz granted Aichi Kokuki KK, a part of the Aichi Clock and Electric Co. (Aichi Tokei Denki KK), a license to manufacture the DB 600A through D models in November, 1936. At that time the Aichi Aircraft Company was building only the Nakajima Kotobuki 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine at its Atsuta Engine Plant, located in south central Nagoya. It was necessary to re-tool the factory for the production of the new Daimler-Benz engine. Two DB 600 engines were imported that year and three the next, all to be used as production patterns. =Experimental status= It was the Imperial Japanese Navy's common practice to use a coded designation while an engine was in experimental or pre-production status. This engine was coded \\"AE1A\\", which decodes as: A=Aichi Tokei Denki KK, E=Liquid-cooled, 1=Aichi's first liquid-cooled engine model, and A=first version of that engine model.Francillon, Ren√© J. Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War. p. 515 Aichi receives Daimler-Benz DB 601A license By early 1938 the Japanese Navy had also acquired the German He 118 V4 two-seat dive bomber aircraft, along with its production rights. This aircraft was powered by the DB 601A. The Heinkel's spectacular performance impressed the IJN Naval Staff so much that the design of the Yokosuka D4Y Suisei (Allied reporting name \\"Judy\\") carrier based dive bomber evolved from it. By 1939, eleven of the more advanced model DB 601A engines were imported. Manufacturing rights were updated for Aichi and granted to Kawasaki to build this model. The new engine received AE1P as its experimental designation. =DB 601A becomes the Atsuta model 32= When the AE1P design was accepted, Aichi's version became the Atsuta 32 and Kawasaki's version became the Ha-40, which was to be used in IJAAS's Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien (Allied reporting name \\"Tony\\") fighter. The Atsuta 12 rated at 1200 hp was chosen to power the Yokosuka D4Y1 when it went into production. The D4Y2 was powered by the 1400 hp Atsuta 32 when it became available. The success of both airplanes was attributed to the slender lines of the high powered liquid-cooled engine. =Aichi M6A gets the Atsuta engine= A new top-secret aircraft that was to be transported and launched from a large submarine was ordered by the IJN in the spring of 1942 as the 17-Shi Special Attack Bomber. That aircraft became the Aichi M6A Serian (Shisei-Seiran), along with its M6A1-K Ninzan (Shisei-Seiran Kai) land-based trainer version. Four preproduction M6A aircraft were completed, a firsthand account stating that one had a 1,200 hp Atsuta 12 engine, while the others three had Atsuta 32's. The first aircraft's engine was later changed to an Atsuta 32. Eighteen M6A1 Special Attack Bomber versions followed, and these had the Atsuta 32 engine as well. Lastly, two of the original M6A1 prototypes were converted into M6A1-K Nanzan land-based training aircraft. Engine production Aichi manufactured 873 Atsuta series engines during World War II. These were shared between the twenty-two M6A1/M6A1-K and all D4Y1/2 aircraft.National Air and Space Museum Aichi M6A Data page Peak production of the Atsuta 32 engine was in May, 1944, when 107 engines were produced. =Production problems= A serious problem with the Aichi and Kawasaki version of the Daimler-Benz engine was that of holding a close tolerance fit between the crankshaft and its bearings on this fairly long engine. The result was that the engine proved to be prone to crankshaft failure.Kawasaki Ki-61 Additionally, there was often great difficulties obtaining engine components which, along with repeated air attacks on the Atsuta engine plant, eventually brought engine production to a standstill. =Atsuta production ends= Maintenance difficulties with the Atsuta and Ha-40 engines eventually led to the installation of the more reliable Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 radial engine for the Yokosuka D4Y3 Model 33, and the Mitsubishi Ha-112 radial air-cooled engine for the IJAAS's Kawasaki Ki-61, which then became known as the Kawasaki Ki-100. Such a modification was not possible for the Aichi M6A1 Seiran as it could only use the liquid-cooled inverted-vee type engine, in order to fit into I-400-class submarine's confined hangar, becoming the only Japanese airplane that retained the inverted-vee engine installation through to the end of the war. Evaluation by ATSC Postwar evaluation by the US Air Technical Service Command's Foreign Aircraft Evaluation Centre for the Air Force (located at Wright Field and Freeman Army Airfield) found the Atsuta engine's standard of workmanship was not as good as that of the Army's Kawasaki Ha-40, and far worse than Mitsubishi and Nakajima. Variants and designations=IJNAS engine naming method= It was the Imperial Japanese Navy's common practice to refer to its engines by name, while the Imperial Japanese Army referred to its engines by their engine (Japanese:Hatsudoki abbreviated Ha) model number. Ha numbers were assigned in sequence as the engine design was accepted. The Japanese method of identifying model numbers of aircraft engines is unique in that the model number always has two digits and may be followed by one or more letters. The first digit represents the major version of the engine and the second number represents the minor version of that model engine. The model number follows the name (IJNAS engines) or the Ha number (IJAAF engines). The first model number assigned to an engine is always 11, meaning the first major design and first minor version of that design. A major change to the design increments the first number and resets the second number to one. A minor change to the engine model increments the second number by one. If a very minor change is made, suffix letters are added after the model number. =Engine accepted by IJN= When the AE1A engine was accepted by the IJNAS, its coded designation was dropped and it was name after the Atsuta factory where the engine was manufactured. The first production engine was the Atsuta 12 rated at 1200 hp. The model number 12 indicates this was the first model with one minor change. =Variants= (Note:Under the Unified designation system introduced around 1942-3 the Ha is separated from the number by a hyphen which is absent under the IJAAS system, seeJapanese aircraft engine identification systems) ;Aichi AE1:Initial IJNAS experimental designation for the Atsuta 11. ;Aichi AE1A:IJNAS experimental designation for the Atsuta 12. ;Aichi AE1P:IJNAS experimental designation for the Atsuta 32. ;Aichi Atsuta:IJNAS designation for Kawasaki produced engines to AE1P standard. ;Kawasaki Ha40: IJAAS designation for Kawasaki built Atsuta engines - Up to at sea level with 2,500 rpm, up to at 2,400 rpm and altitude.

R. Akhtar Mukul (1929‚Äì2004) was a Bengali writer and journalist from Bangladesh; earned fame for Chorompotro, a radio program from Shwadhin Bangla Betar Kendra.  Chorompotro  Mukul started the program from the clandestine Shwadhin Bangla Betar Kendra, the radio station run by the Bangladesh Government in Exile in India during the liberation war in 1971 (25 March-16 December) against Pakistani armed forces. Chorompotro, meaning 'the ultimate mail', or an 'ultimatum' was the radio program. Between 25 May and 16 December 1971 Mukul broadcast the feature in 117 episodes in 206 days. In Chorompotro, Mukul used a dramatically funny voice and caricatured the positions of the military President of Pakistan Yahya Khan, the members of his government, his civilian allies like Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, his governors in occupied Bangladesh, army generals and soldiers as well as Pakistan's international allies including the US and China. His language was full of verbal insults. In his offensive language, he used various Bengali dialects of Bangladesh as well as songs and proverbs, folk stories and jokes; and the program found popularity amongst all Bengalees including the freedom fighters, the Bengalee refugees in India as well as the general population in both occupied Bangladesh and West Bengal in India. The broadcasts remained anonymous until the final episode and the final words where he disclosed his name. Chorompotro turned out not to be popular with the authorities in Bangladesh after the liberation and its tapes and scripts stored in the vault of the state radio station were burnt after a change of government in 1975. It was only in 2000 that Chorompotro was printed and published as a collection by Mukul himself. Between 1960 and 2000, Mukul authored thirty more books on subjects like the liberation war and the Bengali language movement of 1952. Mukul in his youth was involved with the leftist political movement and later aligned himself with the Bengali nationalist movement led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was later a career journalist and worked as a local reporter for the news agency UPI. After independence, he became the head of the Bangladesh Radio and moved to a diplomatic career. Following the massacre of President Sheikh Mujib and his family in Dhaka, he lost the job at the Bangladesh High Commission in London and spent years in self-imposed exile in England. In order to survive with his family, he took a laboring job in the garment industry in East London. After his eventual return to Bangladesh and a brief government job, he opened a bookshop in Dhaka and concentrated in writing and publishing his books.

Godena is a five-time Italian champion. Career Godena has won five times the Italian Chess Championship, in 1992, 1993, 1995, 2005 and 2006. He was runner-up in 1990 and 1998. His 2006 victory was closely contested with the then 14-year-old Italian-American prodigy, International Master Fabiano Caruana. Both players finished the contest on 8 points from 11 rounds and Godena triumphed narrowly in the rapid and blitz play-off. He tied for 1st‚Äì4th with Andrei Sokolov, Dra≈æen Sermek and Xie Jun at Cannes 1997. At the Aeroflot Open 2006 in Moscow, Godena tied for 1st‚Äì12th in the A2 group, finishing 12th on tiebreak with a rating performance of 2628. In June 2007, in Arvier, Godena became the champion of the European Union having tied for 1st‚Äì2nd with Serbian Nikola Sedlak, who won the tournament on tie-break, but as a non-European Union citizen, could not be awarded the title.

He has played many times for his country's Olympiad team and at Elista in 1998 posted a score of 66.7% playing board two. For many years Italy's strongest player, he recorded his highest ever Elo rating of 2561 in March 2010. Playing style While Godena was once nicknamed \\"The Italian Machine\\" by Sergei Shipov, other commentators believe that his disproportionate time management might be holding back his further progress. He frequently uses all of his time in the opening and early middle game, relying on positional knowledge, quickfire technique and instinctive reactions to make the remaining moves in incrementally added time. As white, he opens with 1.e4 and as black, prefers the Ruy Lopez and Slav/Semi-Slav variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined. Personal life Born in Valdobbiadene, Godena lives in Finale Ligure.

Written by Peter Curran and David Williams and directed by Brian Burgess, it was first broadcast on 2 April 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, Spectrum is mobilised to protect Roberts, the President of the United States, from assassination by the Mysterons. However, as the Mysterons' self-imposed deadline looms, Captain Scarlet realises that Spectrum has misinterpreted the threat. Plot The Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) vow to \\"destroy President Roberts\\" within 12 hours. Spectrum interprets this as a threat against President Roberts of the United States. On Cloudbase, Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) assigns Captains Scarlet, Blue and Ochre (voiced by Francis Matthews, Ed Bishop and Jeremy Wilkin) to the presidential residence to protect Roberts. Meanwhile, the Angel squadron, led by Symphony Angel, is launched to patrol the surrounding airspace. Elsewhere, reporter Mervin Brand of the Tribune newspaper is flying to the residence to attend the President's news conference. He is killed when his jet crashes after being caught in a thunderstorm and struck by lightning. Later, Mysteron reconstructions of Brand and the jet are intercepted by the Angels, who force Brand to land. Unaware of Brand's true nature, the Angels allow him to complete his journey by road. At the residence, Roberts agrees to Scarlet's security measures but insists that the conference go ahead as planned. One hour before the Mysteron deadline, Brand pulls up outside the residence in a car. However, rather than crash Blue and Ochre's security checkpoint, he suddenly speeds away, almost running over the officers in the process. The conference ends without further incident and Roberts, thinking the danger has passed, asks Scarlet if he can attend the launching of the Trans-Pacific Shipping Corporation's new atomic-powered liner. When the President explains that the ship is to be christened \\"President Roberts\\", Scarlet realises that Spectrum is protecting the wrong target and races to the nearby docks in a Spectrum Patrol Car. At the docks, Brand infiltrates a private box and uses the Mysteron influence to transform the sacrificial bottle of champagne into a bomb. Just before the bottle is released, Scarlet arrives and alerts the spectators to the sabotage. Brand pulls a gun on Scarlet but the officer shoots him first. The docks are evacuated, but Brand is still alive and releases the bottle. However, it falls short of President Roberts bow and swings back into the box, where it explodes and obliterates both Brand and Scarlet, though \\"President Roberts\\" is now safe. A week later, Roberts believes Scarlet to be dead, but is amazed when the revived captain joins Blue in his office. Production \\"The Launching\\" was originally filmed on Century 21 Studios' Stage 3 between May and June 1967. A re-shoot was conducted on the same stage that October after Century 21 learnt that the Chicago Tribune, the character Mervin Brand's employer, shared its name with a real-life newspaper. To avoid trademark infringement, all verbal and visual references to the publication were shortened to \\"Tribune\\", which involved re-filming all of the miniature model shots of Brand's plane, a radio conversation between Brand and the Angels in the air and a face-to-face conversation between Brand and Harmony Angel on the ground. Scenes set inside President Roberts' residence were also re-shot, possibly to include a more stylised version of the presidential seal. The re-shoot, which was completed while \\"Expo 2068\\" was being filmed on Stage 4, made the production of \\"The Launching\\" one of the most difficult of all Captain Scarlet episodes. Footage cut from the completed episode includes a short scene in which Roberts is said to come from the same town as Symphony Angel. After appearing in the re-shoot, the puppet that plays Roberts (\\"revamp puppet\\" number 19) was removed from Century 21's pool of guest marionettes and prepared for its regular role as Sam Loover in the following Supermarionation series Joe 90. A duplicate of the puppet was created to appear as Colgan in the Captain Scarlet series finale \\"The Inquisition\\".Bentley 2017, p. 203. The studio model of the presidential residence was made from the central part of the Creighton-Ward Mansion model from Thunderbirds. The Tribune Building was a modification of a model that had first appeared in \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\".Bentley 2017, p. 171. Some of the episode's incidental music was originally composed for Thunderbirds, Stingray and Fireball XL5. New incidental music was recorded on 23 July 1967 at composer Barry Gray's private studio, where it was performed by a four-member band. Music for \\"Lunarville 7\\" was recorded on the same day. \\"The Launching\\" is the only episode of Captain Scarlet for which Chinese actress Lian-Shin Yang provided the voice of Harmony Angel. In earlier episodes the character had been voiced by Liz Morgan, who also voiced Destiny and Rhapsody Angels. Although Lian-Shin was a credited member of the voice cast for the last 20 episodes of Captain Scarlet, she voiced no characters after \\"The Launching\\", which is the last episode of the series to feature Harmony Angel in a speaking capacity.Bentley 2017, p. 63. Broadcast and reception \\"The Launching\\" was first transmitted on 2 April 1968 on ATV Midlands. On 28 November 1969, shortly after the introduction of regular colour broadcasting in the UK, it was transmitted in colour on Granada Television.Bentley 2017, p. 121. =Critical response= Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine calls the episode \\"particularly entertaining ... with a most satisfying last-second cliffhanger resolution\\". In a negative review of the episode, writer Fred McNamara describes \\"The Launching\\" as well paced but also \\"anticlimactic\\" and suffering from a \\"conspicuous lack of genuine plot\\". He calls the plot twist \\"flatly\\" delivered, stating that the reveal of the Mysterons' true target \\"goes for a bang but has little impact, whilst watching the episode back only shows how mundane the whole affair winds up being.\\" He adds that Spectrum's focus on protecting the wrong target dampens the tension, also opining that \\"the few elements that make 'The Launching' worth watching bear little relation to the episode's plot itself.\\" Besides questioning the Mervin Brand doppelganger's decision to linger outside the presidential residence when his actual objective is the ocean liner, McNamara also argues that the brief appearance of President Roberts herself fails to \\"convey the majesty of the craft\\". However, he praises the scene of the original Brand's death and reconstruction, describing it as \\"evocative\\" and \\"Gothic\\", and states that the use of a fictional US president as a guest character leads to some \\"welcome world-building\\" on the part of the scriptwriters.

These were orphans, rejected by their families or had no possibility of \\"living honestly in poverty and misery\\". Fr. Andrea received charitable collections from the Knights of Malta as well as from wealthy Maltese. This went in aid of the girls and to cover cost and upkeep of the conservatory. Fr. Andrea also opened a second home for battered women. The Little Church of Christ the Redeemer (in Maltese: Kristu Redentur), commonly known as Sagaramentini Church for the Perpetual Adoration, is part of the same building. It belonged to the Adoration Sisters of Mary. When the sisters left Malta in 1923, Archbishop Mauro Caruana called on Reverend Mother Margherita of the Franciscan Sisters of the Heart of Jesus to take over the house and church. Without any financial assistance, the Franciscan nuns accepted the invitation and contributed by promoting a daily adoration to our Lord in Sacrament. They continued the daily exposition and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, often hosting girls in their house of retreat.

After returning in 1859, Scherzer was appointed as a councillor of the board of trade, held an office in the bureau of foreign relations, and was tasked with compiling the commercial statistics of the empire. As a reward for his publications, Scherzer was knighted in 1866. During 1869 he was the leader of an expedition to eastern Asia.

Early life Iravatham Mahadevan was born on 2 October 1930 in a Tamil Brahmin family of Thanjavur district. Mahadevan had his schooling in the town of Tiruchirapalli and graduated in Chemistry from the Vivekananda College, Chennai and law from the Madras Law College. During his childhood and adolescence, Mahadevan was associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Mahadevan successfully passed the Indian Administrative Service examinations held in 1953 and was allotted to the Tamil Nadu cadre.Ancient Indus Valley Script Iravatham Mahadevan Interview Civil service Mahadevan worked as an Assistant Collector in Coimbatore district and Sub-Collector at Pollachi. In 1958, Mahadevan was transferred to Delhi as Assistant Financial Adviser in India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry serving from 1958 to 1961. In 1961, Mahadevan was posted to Madras as Deputy Secretary in Government of Tamil Nadu's Industries Department and served as Director of Handlooms and Textiles Department from 1962 to 1966. Mahadevan voluntarily retired from the civil service in 1980. Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions According to an interview given to an e-journal Varalaaru, Mahadevan revealed that he started researching the Tamil-Brahmi script following a casual suggestion by Indian historian K. A. Nilakanta Sastri during a meeting in 1961. Earlier, during his stint in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Delhi in 1958‚Äì61, Mahadevan had become acquainted with the noted epigraphist and art historian C. Sivaramamurti who was then working as a curator at the Indian Museum next block. Sivaramamurti initiated him into the basics of South Indian epigraphy. Mahadevan first published his study of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions at Pugalur in Kerala in 1965 following those of Mangulam, the next year. In the same year, Mahadevan presented his paper on Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions in Madras which was later published as the book Corpus of the Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions. After a brief period of research with the Indus script, Mahadevan resumed his work on Tamil-Brahmi in 1992 with active support from the Tamil Nadu Archaeological Department. In 2003, he published a revised edition of the 1966 book which has since acquired the status of a classic. Indus script Mahadevan started his research on the Indus script following a brush with W. W. Hunter's book on the Indus Script at India's Central Secretariat Library in Delhi. In 1970, Mahadevan was offered the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship to do his doctoral research on the Indus Script. Mahadevan continued his research even after his fellowship ended and published his first book Indus Script: Concordance and Tables in 1977. Following a break from 1991 to 2003 to complete his research on Tamil epigraphy, Mahadevan resumed his studies again in 2003. Gregory Possehl called Mahadevan a \\"careful, methodical worker, taking care to spell out his assumptions and methods. ... 'Tentative conclusions' and 'working hypotheses' are more his style than set ideas and fait accompli\\".Gregory L. Possehl, Indus Age: The Writing System (1997), p. 130 Significant contributions Iravatham Mahadevan's The Indus Script: Texts, Concordance and Tables (1977) is the only openly available corpus of the Indus Script. He wrote over 40 papers to further the Dravidian hypothesis of the Indus Script and argues for a continuity between the written records of Indus and the oral transmissions from the Rig Veda. He was instrumental in firmly establishing the view of K.V. Subrahmanya Aiyer that the writings found in the caves of Tamil Nadu in a script similar to Brahmi are a variant of Brahmi, which Mahadevan calls Tamil Brahmi, and in ascertaining that the language of the script is indeed Tamil.Early Tamil Epigraphy.

Lannon makes music under the names Nyles Lannon; n.Lannon; and formerly recorded under the alias of N.LN. Style Lannon's music is a hybrid of homegrown acoustic folk, space rock and electronic aesthetics. Although sometimes described as a singer/songwriter, Lannon's music ranges subdued electronic pop to delicate finger picked acoustics to \\"glitchy\\" beats and soulful rock. N.LN, however, is mostly instrumental, abstract electronica. Musical career At the University of Pennsylvania, Lannon first tasted a bit of minor success with his band Splendorbin, a post-punk \\"math rock\\" band that did well in the Philadelphia area and went on to record with Steve Albini in 1996, but broke up soon after their debut album Stealth came out. Lannon soon had another project, Reizoko, that released the vinyl-only EP T'nance and Tricky Ricky - a spacey, sprawling collection of lo-fi bedroom pop that was harbinger of things to come. During this time Lannon also played in the late Jason DiEmilio's noise band The Azusa Plane, and toured with the band. In 1999, Lannon and Jason Knight (also of the Azusa Plane) moved to San Francisco, and Lannon worked at the music site Epitonic.com for a couple years. He soon joined the SF band Film School and contributed to their debut, the LP Brilliant Career and toured with the band. In 2003, Film School did a 4-song EP, Alwaysnever, which was released by Scott Kannberg's (Pavement) label Amazing Grease. Also in 2003, Lannon completed his first album, Astronomy for Children, under the name N.LN, which was released on the label Highpoint Lowlife. The album was a collection of abstract instrumental electronic tracks, in the vein of artists like Boards of Canada and Aphex Twin, and was recognized as Grooves Magazine's 'Best Album of the Year' in 2004. Also in 2004, Lannon released the album Chemical Friends, which was a bedroom indie- folk collection of songs and which also featured his voice and lyrics for the first time, earning \\"Best Album of the Year\\" from the San Francisco Bay Guardian; \\"Best Folktronica Artist\\" from SF Weekly; and generally positive reviews. In 2005, Film School released their Self-Titled album on Beggars Banquet. Lannon quit Film School in 2006, and soon began work as a session musician, and as a writer for various commercial, film, and TV productions. In 2007, Lannon released another solo album, Pressure, but this one under his full name. The album featured a more rock-oriented pop sound. He married in 2008, and his son Skye was born later that year. Lannon joined forces again with Greg Bertens of Film School and formed the band Sacred Caves, an electronic pop band, and released the Sanctuarium EP in 2012, the same year his daughter Olive was born. In 2015, Lannon released another solo album, Falling Inside, again on the record label Badman Recording Company. 2016 saw him also playing with Film School again, playing some live shows and releasing the June EP that year, and the LP \\"Bright to Death\\" in 2018. Sacred Caves released an LP \\"Love Comes with a Knife\\" in 2017. In 2019, Lannon released \\"The Clouds and the Sea\\"EP on Badman Recording Co. The EP was produced by Count (Tycho, DJ Shadow). Other projects Lannon played guitar with the band, Film School, from 2001‚Äì2006, and joined again in 2015.

Forster arrived in Melbourne, Victoria (Australia) on 18 October 1852 on the Ellen with his parents when he was six years old and was educated at St Luke's school, South Melbourne. On leaving school he was employed by a softgoods merchant and commission agent. Businessman In 1864 Forster began business for himself as a commission agent and later as a general merchant in Little Bourke Street, Melbourne, where he conducted business with the Chinese and was much respected and trusted by them. In 1871 he went to New Zealand establishing a saddlery, Forster & Son. He returned three years later went into partnership with his father in a saddlery business in Melbourne. Philanthropist In early 1883 Forster realized that many boys in Melbourne had nothing to occupy their evenings and were falling into bad habits. In February 1883 he invited three boys off the streets to come to his own home in Canterbury Road, Toorak, Melbourne, to meet his sons. The evening was a success, other boys were invited, and soon a society was organized which met at St John's Sunday-school. In 1885 this room was no longer available and the classes were temporarily suspended, but classes were started in other suburbs and an amalgamation was made with a boys' society conducted by William Groom at North Fitzroy. Forster then gathered the newsboys of the city together in a room in Little Collins Street, and started the Herald Boys' Try Excelsior Class, afterwards known as the City Newsboys' Society. Permissive occupancy of a piece of land in Bowen St. was granted and the Gordon Institute for Boys was built and the Newsboys' Society was transferred to it. In 1890 the Gordon Institute was handed over to the management of Charles D. Barber, and Forster established another Newsboys' Society in a more central position at 192 Little Collins Street. Forster looked after this society with great success until 1901 when he resigned due to health and business reasons; but he remained a member of committee until his death. More than 20 years later its work was being admirably managed by Miss E. C. Onians. Forster's original society made a new start in March 1886, Mrs Margaret Hobson of South Yarra having given him some land. ¬£2000 was collected within a few months and a hall built. Other buildings were added in later years, and the institution became in effect a boys' club, largely managed by themselves, with gymnasium, swimming-pool, a library, and many classes, the fees for which were of the most trifling nature. Included in these classes were bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting, singing, boot-repairing, carpentry, printing, painting and others. Positions were found for boys in town and country, and frail and delicate boys who found their way to the society were often provided for at a country home at Berwick, Victoria. Other boys who had come before the police court and had been placed on probation were helped to make a fresh start in life and many of these ultimately became respected citizens. Forster's health in his later years did not allow him to give so much time to the society, but he retained his position as honorary leader with a seat on the board of management until his death on 6 June 1921. In 1918 the society was renamed the \\"William Forster Try Boys' Society\\". Legacy Forster was married twice, and was survived by five sons and six daughters of the first marriage, and by his second wife and one son of this marriage. The work continued after Forster's death and by 1943, 60 years after the founding of the society, over 25,000 boys had passed through the institution. One of these was the Hon. William Slater, first Australian minister to Soviet Russia, and numerous others have justified the work of the founder and his many helpers. A son, W. C. D. Forster, who had been connected with the movement all his life, was a vice-president of the society at the time of its jubilee.

Harvard.p562‚Äì565. However, others disagree with this account.Sulloway FJ (1979). \\"Geographic isolation in Darwin's thinking: the vicissitudes of a crucial idea\\". Studies in the History of Biology 3: 23-65. During his three years in Algeria, he (amongst other activities) studied the flightless beetles Pimelia and Melasoma. In these genera, a number of species are each confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean. As soon as one crosses a river, a different but closely related species appears.Wagner M (1841). Reisen in der Regentschaft Algier in den Jahren 1836, 1837 & 1838\\\\. Leipzig: Voss. pp. 199-200. Wagner made similar observations in the Caucasus and in the Andean valleys, leading him to conclude, after the Origin of Species had been published:Wagner M (1873). The Darwinian theory and the law of the migration of organisms. Translated by J.L. Laird. London. Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=o9faAAAAMAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false :\\"... an incipient species will only [arise] when a few individuals transgress the limiting borders of their range... the formation of a new race will never succeed... without a long continued separation of the colonists from the other members of their species.\\" This was an early description of the process of geographic speciation by means of the founder effect. Another formulation of this idea came later: \\"Organisms which never leave their ancient area of distribution will never change\\".Wagner M (1889). Die Entstehung der Arten durch r√§umliche Sonderung. Basel: Schwalbe. p. 82. Wagner's idea met with a mixed reception. \\"Unfortunately, Wagner combined [his idea] with some peculiar ideas on variation and selection\\" (Mayr). The leading evolutionists (Darwin, Wallace, Weismann) attacked Wagner's idea of geographic speciation, and it suffered a long decline until in 1942 it was reintroduced by Mayr. The importance of geographic speciation became one of the core ideas of the evolutionary synthesis.Huxley JS (1942). Evolution: the new synthesis. London: Allen & Unwin. Criticism Some modern experts such as Ernst Mayr, Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr,Coyne J.; Orr, H. Allen (2004). Speciation. Sinauer. . argue that Wagner pioneered the idea of geographical speciation, and that Darwin had not appreciated it. However, Wagner's \\"migration theory\\" was based on a rather simple, Lamarckian idea of evolution. Wagner argued in letters to Darwin that the latter had missed a vital geographic component in understanding the evolution of new species. Darwin at first responded in a friendly way to these letters, and agreed that geographic isolation was important (although not the only cause of speciation), and pointed out that he had in fact dealt with geographic speciation in The Origin of Species. Wagner in his later articles totally rejected the importance of natural selection. He again pointed out the importance of intercrossing in preventing divergence, and thus for geographic separation in allowing divergence. Wagner argued that Darwin had not understood this, although these ideas are present in The Origin of Species. Darwin found Wagner's increasingly hysterical tone and one-sided argument upsetting, and wrote across his copy of Wagner's 1875 paper \\"most wretched rubbish.\\" As well as Darwin, the Reverend J.T. Gulick also found Wagner's theories overstated.Gulick JT (1888). \\"Divergent evolution through cumulative segregation\\". Journal of the Linnean Society of London (Zoology) 20: 189-274. Gulick was apparently responding to David Starr Jordan, who approved of Wagner's geographic speciation ideas in a paper which is often cited as providing early support of geographical speciation.Jordan DS (1905). \\"The origin of species through isolation\\". Science [new series] 22: 545-562. Jordan later wrote a brief note of correction agreeing with some of Gulick's criticisms: :\\"Mr. Gulick corrects certain erroneous assumptions on the part of Dr. Moritz Wagner. Mr. Gulick says: # Separate generation is a necessary condition for divergent evolution but not for the transformation of all the survivors of a species in one way. #Separation does not necessarily imply any external barriers or even the occupation of separate districts. #Diversity of natural selection is not necessary to diversity of evolution. #Difference of external conditions is not necessary to diversity of evolution. Separation and variation‚Äîthat is, variation not overwhelmed by crossing‚Äîis all that is necessary to secure divergence of type in the descendants of one stock, though external conditions remain the same and though the separation is other than geological. ... :All of this is in general accord with my own experience.\\"Jordan DS (1905). \\"Ontogenetic species and other species\\". Science [new series] 22: 872-873. In a later paper Gulick says that \\"Moritz Wagner, in his 'Law of the Migration of Organisms,' was the first to insist on the importance of geographical isolation as a factor in evolution, but when he asserted that without geographical isolation natural selection could have no effect in producing new species he went beyond what could be sustained by facts\\".Gulick JT (1908). \\"Isolation and selection in the evolution of species. The need of clear definitions\\". American Naturalist 42 (493): 48-57. Mayr's formulation has been argued to have cleared up issues which Wagner had left unresolved: \\"A new species develops if a population which has become isolated from its parental species acquires during this period of isolation characters which promote or guarantee isolation when the external barriers break down\\".Mayr E (1942). Systematics and the origin of species. New York: Columbia. p. 155 The zoological taxonomist Bernhard Rensch was also significant in keeping geographical speciation on the evolutionary menu.Rensch, Bernhard (1929). Das Prinzip geographischer Rassenkreise und das Problem der Artbildung. Bonn.Rensch, Bernhard (1950). Evolution above the species level. New York: Columbia. He identified geographical separation as the most frequent initial step towards cladogenesis (phylogenetic branching). However, a variety of species concepts compete with Mayr's isolation concept of species today, and so Mayr's account can no longer be accepted to be the gold standard (disambiguation). The importance of Wagner's insight is highly debatable today, as it is clear that geographical isolation is not the only mechanism which causes species-splitting. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that natural selection is the most important cause of speciation, even when the geographical milieu is in isolation.Schilthuizen M (2001). Frogs, flies & dandelions: the making of species. Oxford. p. 34. There is room for debate as to whether Charles Darwin had reached a similar conclusion at the same time. The Origin of Species was published nearly twenty years after Wagner's first account, but more relevant is the evidence of his notebooks. The evidence of Darwin's notebooks (which were not published until the mid-20th century) shows a \\"clear description of reproductive isolation, maintained by ethological [behavioural] isolating mechanisms\\"p266; the same ideas are also present in The Origin of Species, but are often not recognized as such by modern biologists. On the other hand, there is no single example in the notebooks quite so clear as Wagner's flightless beetles. Much of the good in Wagner's ideas is masked by his other, mistaken, beliefs,Mallet J (2009). http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/wagner.html but his inferences about geographical speciation were important insights gained by observation of insects in their natural habitats. :\\"It took more than 60 years after 1859 until the leading specialists... [agreed] that this geographical approach was the way to solve the problem of speciation... a new species may evolve when a population acquires isolating mechanisms while isolated from its parent population.\\".Mayr, Ernst (2001). What evolution is. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 175. But again, see Sulloway's article. Speciation isn't just about geography, it is more important that it requires splitting that endures in spite of geographic overlap.

Born in Vinga in the Austrian Empire (today in Romania) to a Roman Catholic Bulgarian farming family, Dunjov graduated in law and started working as a lawyer in Arad. Having adopted the ideas of Hungarian revolutionaries Lajos Kossuth and S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, he joined their 1848 insurrectionist forces and was elected a member of the regional and city committee in Arad, later serving as a private in the Hungarian Army and a military judge. He participated in a number of battles defending the revolution and was promoted initially to the rank of Captain and then to that of Colonel. Following the revolution's defeat, he was captured and sentenced to death by the Austrian authorities, but his sentence was later reduced to ten years in dungeon. Dunjov was released in 1857 and interned by the authorities in Pest. After the outbreak of the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, Dunjov set for the Kingdom of Sardinia, where he enlisted in the Italian Army. In 1860, after the war had promptly ceased, he joined Giuseppe Garibaldi's Redshirts, taking part in the Expedition of the Thousand, which resulted in the conquest of Sicily for Sardinia. He was the commander of a regiment which included Hungarians and some Banat Bulgarians, and particularly excelled in the decisive Battle of the Volturno. Dunjov was heavily wounded on the battlefield, losing a leg. He was personally congratulated on his merits by Garibaldi and awarded the highest Italian military and civil decorations. Until his death, Dunjov lived in united Italy, engaging in scientific, journalistic and translator's activity. He died in 1889 in the Italian city of Pistoia.

As a movement it only really developed from the late 1990s ‚Äì although one organisation, the Workers Solidarity Movement has had a continuous existence since 1984. Anarchists have been active in Ireland as far back as 1886, but these were short-lived groups or isolated individuals with large gaps between activity.  Origins  The first mention of an Irish connection to anarchism was the Boston-based Irish nationalist W.G.H. Smart, who wrote articles for The Anarchist in 1880 and 1881.The Raven no.6 In 1886, Michael Gabriel, an English anarchist, arrived in Dublin and moved to Bayview Avenue in the North Strand. He was a member of the Socialist League, an organisation whose members included libertarian Marxist William Morris and anarchist Joseph Lane. A branch of the League was formed and it is known that anarchist publications were among those distributed by them. Around the same time, George Bernard Shaw (1856‚Äì1950) wrote the article \\"What's in a name (how an anarchist might put it)\\" at the request of Charlotte Wilson for issue no. 1 of The Anarchist in 1885. Shaw had been taught French by the Communard Richard Deck, who introduced him to Proudhon. Later he was embarrassed by unauthorised reprints, as he was a Fabian socialist, not an anarchist. Irish writer Oscar Wilde notably expressed anarchist sympathies, especially in his essay The Soul of Man under SocialismGoodway, David. Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow. Liverpool University Press, 2006, pp. 62‚Äì92 Around 1890 John Creaghe, an Irish doctor who was joint founder (with Fred Charles), of The Sheffield Anarchist, took part in the \\"no rent\\" agitation before leaving Sheffield in 1891. He went on to become the founding editor in Argentina of the anarchist paper, El Oprimido, which was one of the first to support the \\"organisers\\" current (as opposed to refusal to organise large scale organisations). In 1892 English anarchists visited Fred Allen at the Dublin independent offices to see if his Fair Trial Fund could be used for anarchist as well as Irish Republican Brotherhood prisoners.Owen McGee in The IRB, p. 216; based on Dublin Metropolitan Police report In 1894 at Trinity College Dublin's Fabian Society \\"over 200 students listened sympathetically\\" to a lecture on \\"Anarchism and Darwinism\\"Owen McGee in The IRB, p. 218; based on Dublin police report In the 20th century Captain Jack White was active as an anarchist in the 1930s after returning from the Spanish Revolution.Jack White: Irish Anarchist who organised Irish Citizens ArmyWhite, Captain Jack. Misfit : An Autobiography. Dublin: Livewire publications, 2005 (2nd ed.)  Modern development  In the late 1960s, as the civil rights campaign took off, People's Democracy, before it became a small Trotskyist group, included some self-described anarchists such as John McGuffin and Jackie Crawford. The latter was one of the group who sold Freedom in Belfast's Castle Street in the late 1960s. There was an anarchist banner on the Belfast-Derry civil rights march. PD members, including John Grey, contributed to a special issue of the British Anarchy Magazine about Northern Ireland in 1971. In the early 1970s some ex-members of the Official IRA became interested in anarchism and developed contact with Black Flag magazine in London. Among names used were Dublin Anarchist Group and New Earth. Their existence was brief and not widely known.Glossary of the Left in Ireland 1960‚Äì83 Gralton Magazine, Aug/Sept. 1983 A number of jailings for \\"armed actions\\" saw the group disappear. Two members, Marie and Noel Murray, were later sentenced to death for the killing of an off-duty Garda during a bank raid as part of a group called the Anarchist Black Cross (with no relation to the much older prisoner support group). Their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment on appeal. In 1970 there existed a hippy commune in a squatted house on Dublin's exclusive Merrion Road known as the Island Commune. Some inhabitants, including Ubi Dwyer of Windsor Free Festival fame, sold Freedom outside the GPO on Saturdays. = Origins of the modern movement = The first steps towards building a movement came in the late 1970s when a number of young Irish people who had been living and working in Britain returned home, bringing their new-found anarchist politics with them. Local groups were set up in Belfast, Dublin, Limerick, Dundalk and Drogheda. Over the next decade anarchist papers appeared, some for just one or two editions, others with a much longer life. Titles included Outta Control (Belfast), Anarchist Worker (Dublin), Antrim Alternative (Ballymena), Black Star (Ballymena), Resistance (Dublin) and Organise! (Ballymena). Bookshops were opened in Belfast (Just Books in Winetavern Street) and Dublin (ABC in Marlborough Street). All of these groups attracted people who identified themselves as anarchists but had little in the way of agreed politics or activities, and no organised discussions or education about anarchism. This imposed limits to what they could achieve and even to their continued existence ‚Äì all groups were short-lived, had little impact and left no lasting legacy. In 1978, ex-members of the Belfast Anarchist Collective and the Dublin Anarchist Group decided that a more politically united, class-based, and public organisation was necessary. Their discussions led to the Anarchist Workers Alliance, which existed from 1978‚Äì81, although only to any substantial extent in Dublin. It produced Anarchist Worker nos. 1‚Äì7; documents on the national question, women's liberation, trade unions, and a constitution. Some anarchist-inspired material can also be seen on Indymedia.ie. =Modern conception of Irish anarchism= Ireland has seen a relatively large comparative growth in anarchist politics in various forms since the alter- Globalisation movement of the 1990s and 2000s. Dublin now hosts numerous explicitly anarchist squats, as well as regular social events facilitating for the anarchist scene in various locations. Irish anarchists have been involved in activities such as squatting and anti-fascist action, and have been active within the pro-choice and anti water charge movements. = Active organisations = There are several anarchist organisations currently operating in Ireland: *The Workers Solidarity Movement is a platformist anarchist group with members in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Belfast, Derry, and Galway formed in 1984. *A Belfast branch of the British Solidarity Federation, which was formerly Organise!, a small class struggle anarchist organisation formed in 2003 from a merger of the Anarcho-Syndicalist Federation, Anarchist Federation, Anarchist Prisoner Support and a number of individuals. *The Dublin-based Revolutionary Anarcha-Feminist Group (RAG), a group for female anarchists was formed in 2005 and has published six issues of a magazine, The Rag. *In April 2015, the Dublin Anarchist Black Cross (ABC) was founded.https://dublinabc.ana.rchi.st/2015/04/introducing-dublin-anarchist- black-cross/ There are also a number of organisations and spaces which, while perhaps not explicitly anarchist, share much in common with the anarchist movement. These include the Grassroots Gatherings (2001‚Äìpresent), the Dublin Grassroots Network (2003‚Äì2004), Grassroots Dissent (2004‚Äì), Galway Social Space (2008‚Äì2010), Rossport Solidarity Camp (2005‚Äì2014), Jigsaw (WSM venue) formerly titled Seomra Spraoi (2004‚Äì2015), 'Grangegorman' Squat (2013-2015) and the Barricade Inn (2015‚Äì2016).

Warping may be used for correcting image distortion as well as for creative purposes (e.g., morphingBeier, Thaddeus. Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis. Siggraph '92). The same techniques are equally applicable to video. Overview While an image can be transformed in various ways, pure warping means that points are mapped to points without changing the colors. This can be based mathematically on any function from (part of) the plane to the plane. If the function is injective the original can be reconstructed. If the function is a bijection any image can be inversely transformed. Some methods are: *Images may be distorted through simulation of optical aberrations. *Images may be viewed as if they had been projected onto a curved or mirrored surface. (This is often seen in ray traced images.) *Images can be partitioned into polygons and each polygon distorted. *Images can be distorted using morphing. The most obvious approach to transforming a digital image is the forward mapping. This applies the transform directly to the source image, typically generating unevenly-spaced points that will then be interpolated to generate the required regularly-spaced pixels. However, for injective transforms reverse mapping is also available. This applies the inverse transform to the target pixels to find the unevenly-spaced locations in the source image that contribute to them. Estimating them from source image pixels will require interpolation of the source image. To work out what kind of warping has taken place between consecutive images, one can use optical flow estimation techniques.

History The group was established in May 1999 during a social event hosted by members of other LGBT groups. The members of those groups, BGLAD (Bahamian Gays and Lesbians Against Discrimination) and Hope TEA (Hope Through Education and Awareness), decided it would be better to pool their resources together and create one national gay rights organization. They named it ‚ÄúThe Rainbow Alliance of The Bahamas.‚Äù At that time RAB was essentially a support group, organizing LGBT socials and the annual, low-key gay pride event in The Bahamas. However, in 2004 when Bishop Sam Greene threatened to blow up parliament if the government had followed Canada and legalized gay marriage in The Bahamas, group members felt the need to stand up against him and other forms of bigotry and discrimination in the country. The activist arm of the group placed it in the public spotlight between 2004 and 2008. The group eventually disbanded in 2008 due to a lack of resources. Legal fight There is no legislation in The Bahamas that addresses basic human rights concerns of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) people. In fact, discrimination can be found in existing laws on same-sex relationships. One example is the law regarding the age of consent. Homosexual relations between consenting adults have been legal in The Bahamas since May 1991, but the age of consent is two years higher than that for heterosexuals ‚Äì 18 vs. 16. Adult heterosexual men can legally engage in sexual activity with 16-year-old girls, though these teens are considered minors. Homosexual men however, have been charged before the courts for having consensual sex with 16- and 17-year-old males. LGBT Bahamians are also subject to discrimination in employment. The Employment Bill of 2001, which had a clause barring discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation, was passed with that clause removed. The law was amended again in 2002, still without protecting LGBT Bahamians. In addition to protesting these laws, RAB spoke out strongly against its lack of inclusion in the former government's Constitutional Reform Commission. The Commission, which included outspoken anti-gay Bishop Sam Greene, had been reviewing the country‚Äôs unamended 1973 constitution between 2003 and 2006. It failed to consider a person‚Äôs sexual orientation as an attribute deserving of protection from discrimination in a preliminary report it presented to the Cabinet on March 21, 2006.

It was composed in verse by an unknown author at the beginning of the 14th century. The Chronicle compiles information from older Czech chronicles written in Latin and also the author's own experiences. The chronicle finishes before 1314, but it is usually published including the entries of later authors describing events up to 1319. The Chronicle alleged that all Slavs originated \\"in the south\\". It stated that \\"in the Serbian nation there is a land, known as Croatia; in this country there was a chieftain whose name was ƒåech.\\" The validity of the events are nowadays rejected by some western historians as purely mythological folklore, an archetypal origin myth. The events in the chronicle seem to simply reinterpret the myth of Lech, Czech, and Rus that is repeated in various forms in many other historical records and national chronicles, like Primary Chronicle. It is also supported by recent geogenetics research. The Dalimil was translated three times into Middle High German (including the recently identified translation by Merbort), and once into Latin.

John Ronald Burnet, 11 October 1918, Saltaire, Shipley ‚Äì 6 March 1999) was an English first-class cricketer and the last amateur captain of Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Yet despite this, and his modest playing record, he is remembered as a success in that his captaincy laid the foundation of Yorkshire's dominance of the County Championship during the 1960s. History With top class amateur players becoming a rarity, Burnet was an unlikely choice for captain. He was a 39-year-old Bradford Cricket League batsman who would never have made the first team on playing ability, yet his strong personality was the element needed to turn Yorkshire from strife-ridden also rans to a formidable outfit. Surrey had won seven county championships in a row during the 1950s and Yorkshire were determined to end their dominance. Burnet was brought in to unite a faction-ridden dressing room after Billy Sutcliffe's ineffectual reign. Burnet had led Baildon to success in the Bradford League in the early 1950s, and proved himself an effective leader of Yorkshire's Second XI since 1953, the team winning the Minor Counties Championship under his command in 1957. The move was successful in the long term but painful in the short. Yorkshire finished out of the top ten for the first time in their history in his first year in charge after Johnny Wardle, the hugely talented left arm spinner, was sacked for disciplinary rather than playing reasons. This execution concentrated the minds of the remaining senior pros and in Burnets second and last season Yorkshire won the County Championship, something which would become a habit for the rest of the decade. Burnet was a limited batsman in first-class terms, but his influence cannot be measured by his individual figures, rather by the effect his leadership had on the field. Batting right-handed, usually low down in the order, he scored 897 runs at just 12.63 with a best of 54, one of only 3 half centuries in 77 innings. He took a solitary wicket. He served on the Yorkshire Cricket Committee as a Bradford representative from 1960 to 1969 and then for Harrogate district from 1978 until 1983 when another bout of civil war threatened to tear the club in two. The man at the centre of the storm was Geoff Boycott. Once again some senior members in the club felt that only by the sacrifice of a great player could harmony and success be restored to the team, but this time the members revolted, Boycott's supporters swept the committee and Burnet was voted out of power. He had put his leadership skills to good use in the meantime, however, and was the chairman of a chemical company for 23 years. Burnet served as president of the Bradford League from 1959 to 1969 and was awarded the OBE for his services to the Sport in Yorkshire and Humberside. He died in 1999, at the age of 80. Tributes to Burnet Brian Close, one of Burnet's championship winning side, told the York Evening Press that \\"Ronnie put his heart and soul into Yorkshire cricket which was his life. He did an excellent job and was always a great encouragement to the younger lads who played under his captaincy. He was always great company to be in and I always enjoyed meeting up with him. I shall miss him very much.\\" Doug Padgett, the county's most prolific batsman in 1959 with 1,807 runs and Yorkshire's coach at the time of Burnet's death, said: \\"Ronnie turned the side round when he became captain. Everyone respected him and he had the ability to get the best out of his players who would go through hell and high water for him. He took over in troubled times but he stood no nonsense and he sorted things out. He did not pretend to being a first-class player himself but he turned us into a side which won seven championships and two Gillette Cup finals over a ten-year period.\\" Bob Platt, who opened the bowling with Fred Trueman in Burnet's team and rose to become Cricket Chairman, said: \\"Like so many others of my generation, I started off under Ronnie in the second team and I greatly admired and respected him. He was an outstanding man for Yorkshire County Cricket Club and he was always ready to give advice right up to the end. He was a strong leader and the man responsible for moulding most of the players who went on to win the championship so often.\\" References *Cricinfo Profile *Obituary with tribute quotes Category:1918 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Yorkshire cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricket captains Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Cricketers from Shipley, West Yorkshire Category:English cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers ","title":"Ronnie Burnet"},{"id":"10403586","text":"Choisy-en-Brie () is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle-de- France region in north-central France.

It has a population of 25,213 people, including new returnees (2006 official UNDP est.). Around 70% are Tajiks and 30% Pashtuns. Guldara district borders Parvan Province to the west, Farza District to the north, Qarabagh, Kalakan and Mir Bacha Kot districts to the east, and Shakardara District to the south. Its headquarters is Guldara, which is a village in the northeastern part of the district; the district itself comprises 45 villages. Guldara District was part of Shakardara District until Burhanuddin Rabbani's government. Almost the whole district was destroyed during the civil war and the main villages near the main road to Kabul are destroyed. It is small district with isolated villages. However, since 2001 grate progress has taken place, mainly in infrastructure and basic amenities. Over the last few years, the Government has shown increasing commitment to make its development interventions more effective, enduring, equitable and responsive to the needs and priorities of communities at the district level. Agricultural and livestock productions are low in Guldara District due to lack of agricultural mechanization system, inadequate agricultural water and spread of animal and plant diseases. Destruction or lack of roads has created transportation problems and has raised food and other required materials prices, similarly, inaccessibility to professional physicians, adequate health centres and quality medicines have increased health problems. Thus, the number of existing schools is inadequate, the distance between schools and student's house is quite long and the schools luck buildings, which the students study in open places and occasionally cause them sickness. Moreover, unemployment rate is high and a great number of residents immigrate to neighbouring countries to find jobs or they become drug dependent inside the country. Instability and insecurity rate increase due to lack of police, national army and experienced personnel in security departments. Based on the above-mentioned issues, weak economy and poverty has been considered as the main problem of the people.

It is often called the Second Medical College in St. Petersburg because of its renaming in 1920 (see below), relative to Saint Petersburg State Medical University, which is called the First Medical College. The university is currently constructing the largest infectious diseases hospital in Saint Petersburg, a title formerly claimed by the Botkin hospital. The NWSMU has a long tradition of educating Russian and international students. More than 35,000 physicians graduated from the university. Since beginning the international program in 1947 there have been more than 3500 international graduates from more than 50 countries. Currently there is a total student population of over 5,000.

The son of a fruit-grower, Herbert was born in Diamond Creek, Victoria in 1898; was educated at Malvern State School and the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, then matriculated to the University of Melbourne, from which he obtained a BSc in Biology in 1918 and a MSc in Botany in 1920. He began his botanic career in 1919 as a botanical assistant in the Explosives Section of Western Australia's Mines Department. He was later appointed Economic Botanist and Plant Pathologist for Western Australia, and also lectured part-time in agricultural botany and plant pathology at the University of Western Australia. During this time he made a number of collecting expeditions in south-west Western Australia, and published a number of plant taxa, of which Logania tortuosa, Melaleuca coronicarpa, Daviesia uniflora, Xanthorrhoea brevistyla and Xanthorrhoea nana (Dwarf Grasstree) remain current. In 1921, he published a book, The Poison Plants of Western Australia. In 1921, Herbert took up a position as Professor of Plant Physiology and Pathology at the University of the Philippines. On 11 December 1922 he married his assistant Vera McNeilance Prowse, daughter of John Henry Prowse; they would have two sons and two daughters. Herbert returned to Australia in 1924, joining the Botany Department of the University of Queensland. Initially his position was that of lecturer, but in 1929 he obtained his D.Sc. from the University of Melbourne, and he was awarded an honorary D.Sc. by the University of Queensland in 1935. In 1946 he was promoted to associate professor; two years later he was appointed acting professor, and shortly afterwards foundation professor of botany. He was later made Dean of the Faculty of Science. Herbert was President of the Queensland Naturalists' Club in 1926; of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1928; of the botany section of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in 1932; of the Horticultural Society of Queensland from 1936 to 1942; of the Orchid Society of Queensland in 1940; and of the Queensland branch of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science in 1942. He lectured on horticulture for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, judged garden competitions, and wrote for the Sunday Mail. In 1952 he published a compilation of his Sunday Mail articles entitled Gardening in Warm Climates. During World War II he helped select sites for research into chemical warfare, and co-wrote a survival manual for the Royal Australian Air Force entitled Friendly Fruits and Vegetables. Herbert retired in 1965, and a year later was appointed CMG. He died in Royal Brisbane Hospital on 8 September 1976, and his body was cremated. One of his sons, John Desmond, was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, and a minister in Frank Nicklin's Country Party government. A daughter born in 1930, Joan Winifred (Cribb), herself became a botanist of some renown. Eucalyptus herbertiana was named in his honour. Herbert was red-green colour blind.

The last event took place between 28 December 2015 and 5 January 2016 and was held in Melbourne, Victoria. Brisbane hosts the next Pol-Art from 27 December 2018 to 6 January 2019.  History  PolArt is a celebration of Polish cultural heritage in Australia and New Zealand. PolArt festivals have now become a traditional feature of the Polish-Australian cultural life, and were made possible by the Federation of Polish Women in Australia and New Zealand undertaking the massive task of organising the first festival of Polish culture, originally called ArtPol, in Sydney in 1975. Over 200 young performers participated in the Gala Concert at the Sydney Opera House. It was so successful that a second festival was organized. Renamed PolArt, it was held in Adelaide in 1981 and thus started the trend for the festival to be held every three years each time in a different capital city in Australia. The sequence of PolArt festivals has been: 1st 1975 Sydney 2nd 1981 Adelaide 3rd 1984 Melbourne 4th 1988 Brisbane 5th 1991 Sydney 6th 1994 Adelaide 7th 1997 Melbourne 8th 2000 Brisbane 9th 2003 Sydney 10th 2006 Hobart 11th 2009 Adelaide 12th 2012 Perth 13th 2015 Melbourne 14th 2018 Brisbane  Participating dance ensembles =Beskidy and Iskierki ‚Äì Rowville, VictoriaKujawy ‚Äì Sydney= The ensemble Kujawy take their name from a region in Poland known as Kujawy. Its three main cities are Bydgoszcz, Torun and W≈Çoc≈Çawek. The dance ensemble was formed over 40 years ago. The idea of the dance ensemble was formed by a group of Polish women in Cabramatta, who thought that it would be a wonderful way for the youth of Polish families to get together and learn the traditions of Poland. Many of the youth that belong to the ensemble today are of 3rd generation. Not many speak Polish fluently, but they all have that little spark that has been placed there by their parents. Currently there are 65 members in the ensemble ranging from 4 years of age onwards. The ensemble has developed a highly varied and acclaimed repertoire, thanks to the artistic direction of teachers and choreographers Marek and Wieslawa Wojnicz (former members of the Polish State Dance Ensemble ‚ÄòSlask‚Äô). When the dance ensemble performs the very beautiful Suita Slaska the viewer is mesmerized and taken back to the Slask (Silesian) area of southern Poland. The costumes are very rich and in all there are three main costumes that the ensemble performs in Cieszynski, Gorniczy and Rozbarski. The ensemble also has many other beautiful dances from many other regions of Poland. Some of these will be seen tonight. Some of these are Goralski, Krakowiak, Kujawiak/Oberek, Polonez, Sieradz, Opolske and many more. Kujawy have performed at all PolArt festivals since inception. In 1987 they represented Australia in the World Festival of Dances in Spain and Majorca. In 1991 and 2001 some of the members went to Poland to perform at the 11th and then 12th International Folkloric Festival held in Rzeszow, Poland. Over Christmas 2005 the ensemble went for a holiday to New Zealand for 13 days. While in Wellington they gave a 2 ¬Ω hour concert at the ‚ÄòTe Wha Nee theatre. This was a great success and the concert was a sell out. The ensemble received excellent reviews in the Dominion Post ‚Äì Wellington. Over Christmas 2006, Kujawy attended the PolArt Festival held in Hobart Tasmania with great success. Their performance has been written up on the Polish internet site Swiat Polonii. The group travelled to Poland in July 2008 to perform at the 14th International Folkloric Festival held in Rzeszow, Poland. Not only did the group perform in Rzeszow but also performed in Slupsk, Ustka and Wloclawek Poland. In 2009 the group has performed at many concerts including Eurofest at Frenches Forrest and will be performing at the Oktoberfest and Polish Christmas at Darling Harbour in December before their departure to the PolArt 2009 festival held in Adelaide. 2012 saw the group travel to Perth for the first PolArt festival to be held in WA. This was a huge success. 2015 the group travelled to Melbourne for the next PolArt Festival held in Victoria. 2016 was the 40th Anniversary of Kujawy-Sydney. In 2017 Kujawy once again travelled to Rzeszow for the 17th International Folkloric Festival in Poland. 2018 once again will see Kujawy go to the next PolArt Festival to be held in Brisbane QLD. All costumes are funded by functions that the ensemble puts on during the year, and the ensemble is always on the lookout for sponsors to help them. . =Kuku≈Çeczka ‚Äì Perth= The Polish folkloric dance group Kukuleczka was founded 20 years ago as a children's dance group at the Polish Ethnic School in Maylands. Its vision was to encourage Polish youth to stay connected to the traditions of their parents and ancestors and to promote Polish culture to the broader Perth community. Today, while the group proudly continues this vision, it has outgrown its original format and has become an ensemble that measures up to the best amateur folkloric dance groups. It has been invited to perform at international and local intercultural events, and since 1994 it has participated in PolArt festivals, triennial events celebrating Polish culture and art in Australia and New Zealand. To commemorate its 20th birthday in style, Kukuleczka put on The Folkloric Christmas Concert 2011 on Sunday, 11 December 2011. The event involved about 40 dancers and vocalists and attracted close to 300 spectators who filled the Cracovia Club's ball room to capacity. The three-hour spectacle, featuring a blend of 13 traditional Polish folk dances from various regions of Poland and Christmas carols left the audience no dull moment. The performance of children dancers received a particularly warm applause. The performers presented their skills on the stage against the background of folkloric motifs, which were complemented by images of regional Polish landscapes presented on a large stage-side projector screen, corresponding to the different dances and songs. =Lajkonik ‚Äì Sydney= ‚ÄúLajkonik\\" Polish Song and Dance Ensemble is a community group, now based in Marayong in the Blacktown area, since 2014.

V. Subramaniam, popularly known as Subbudu, was one of the most important dance and music critics of India. He was born on 27 March 1917, and died in New Delhi on 29 March 2007, only two days after his 90th birthday. Early life Subbudu spent his early life in Burma (present name Myanmar). In the wake of the World War II, under general evacuation orders by the British, his family left Burma, undertaking a long and hard journey on foot through the North-East India. In India, first he moved to Shimla and soon blossomed into a cultural critic, when he started commenting local carnatic music soirees. Soon Kalki the Tamil magazine started by Kalki Krishnamurthy and T. Sadasivam. published his first full-fledged review. A chance meeting with V K Narayana Menon, the then Deputy Director of All India Radio resulted in Subbudu's appointment as dance and music critic for the newspaper The Statesman. Music and Dance Critic In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Subbudu's acerbic wit and deep knowledge of music made many readers look forward to his views. But he also made many enemies. A board saying \\"Dogs and Subbudu not allowed,\\" was hung outside the Madras Music Academy in Chennai during the 1980s. An example of his commenting is what Subbudu said about the doyen of Karnatic Music, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer: \\"Even the dreaded Emergency has come to an end, but there seems to be no end of Semmangudi\\" . Madras Music Academy convened an emergency meeting to condemn Subbudu and reaffirm their faith in the greatness of Semmangudi. He was no mere wielder of an acid pen; he had deep insight into both arts‚Äîdance and music‚Äîhe commented upon. For example, he compared the Hindustani and Carnatic Systems of Music and brought out strengths and weaknesses of both system in the following few words: \\"I am also listening Hindustani music from my birth. I am also commenting upon them in Delhi papers. I am writing without being afraid of any one. In fact, there is nothing great in Hindustani music apart from the purity of the shruti. It is because of the lack of purity of ≈õruti that South Indian music is not perhaps appreciated in the North. Further in Hindustani music, every artist specializes in specific aspect ‚Äì khayal, dhrupad, thapa, thumri etc. So far as rhythm (tala) is concerned, they are still at an elementary level\\".Subramaniam P V Isai Thukatai (Tamil), p. 153 In the early 1990s, Subbudu was the prominent critic of A.R.Rahman's syncretic music style. He lambasted the maestro for drowning the lyrics with gadgetry. He have appeared as himself in the Tamil film Ivan. NotesExternal links * TRIBUTE TO SUBBUDU * .

Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the group was established by composer David Stock in 1976. It has premiered over 200 works and is a major regional cultural attraction . Emphasis is placed on pieces by modern composers and recent past seasons have featured works by Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Frederic Rzewski, George Crumb, John Cage, David Lang, Robert Black and others. In 2001, conductor Kevin Noe took over from the group's founder, becoming the new Artistic Director. The troupe quickly made radical changes and struck out in a new direction using an entirely new team of musicians and artists. Since that time, PNME programs are carefully structured to create thematic unity and theatrical continuity similar to that of drama or film. Set changes are minimized and carefully choreographed to eliminate the disruption between pieces. Non-musical elements such as video, projected images and spoken word are added to enhance continuity over the arc of a performance. Programs are often presented seamlessly without intermission or even pauses between works. Also, theatrical elements such as lighting, costuming, and blocking cohere into a dramatic musical experience. PNME Artistic Director Kevin Noe has dubbed this model the ‚ÄúTheater of Music.‚Äù Since 2001, the group's attendance has grown by more than 600%, and the number of concerts has more than doubled. PNME performances take place over a series of weekend concerts in the midsummer in Pittsburgh at the City Theatre.

Her single-person ride in search of an urgently needed powder supply for the endangered Clendenin's Settlement (present-day Charleston, West Virginia) was used as the template for Charles Robb's 1861 poem \\"Anne Bailey's Ride\\". She is known as the Heroine of the Kanawha Valley.  Early life  Plaque where Bailey used to live near Falling Spring, Virginia \\"Mad Anne\\" Bailey was born in Liverpool, England. She first arrived in Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, at about the age of 19 after both of her parents died in 1760. In 1765, she married a British soldier named Richard Trotter. He served in Lord Dunmore's War and was killed on October 10, 1774, in an encounter with the Shawnee tribe forces led by Cornstalk at the Battle of Point Pleasant.  Military service  Trotter's death was a turning point in Anne's life. She left her son William with a close neighbor, then joined the militia. Bailey worked as a scout and courier during the Revolutionary War. Bailey was involved in the campaigns against Shawnee Native Americans, who gave her the nickname \\"Mad Anne.\\". She was also known as the \\"White Squaw of Kanawha. In 1788, Anne married John Bailey, a frontiersman and ranger. The couple was posted to Fort Lee. Bailey continued her service for the U.S. military by patrolling the frontier against Native Americans and acting as a messenger between Fort Lee and frontier posts. It was here in 1791 that the local fort, Fort Lee, was under heavy threat, when Anne made her legendary 100 mile ride to Fort Savannah at Lewisburg for much needed ammunition. Her path was through wilderness, and she rode both directions successfully and is credited with saving Fort Lee. She remained on duty until 1795 where the Treaty of Greenville ended the Northwest Indian War. In 1794, John Bailey was murdered near Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia), and his will was filed in the county court that same year. After that, she lived with her son but still traveled and visited friends. A few years after John Bailey's death, she traveled to Alabama, apparently to visit her stepson, Abram Bailey. When her son and his family left Virginia for Gallia County, Ohio, she left with them. Until her death, she continued to travel. Her remains were later moved to Tu-Endie-Wei State Park. The museum there shows several of her memorabilia with special mention of a design made from her hair.  Later life  Bailey was widowed again, encouraging her to move further into the frontier to Gallia, Ohio, in 1818. On the frontier, Bailey continued to act as an express rider despite being over seventy years old. She died in Ohio in 1825 at eighty-three years old. Her remains were reinterred in 1901 in the Point Pleasant, West Virginia, State Park.  Legacy  Several institutions have been named for Anne Bailey, including Anne Bailey Elementary in St. Albans, West Virginia, the Daughters of the American Revolution chapter in Charleston, West Virginia, and a lookout tower in Watoga State Park.

The governor was to display the badge in the centre of the Union Jack when travelling by sea; vessels owned by the colony's government were to display it in the fly of the Blue Ensign; and, with Admiralty permission, privately owned ships registered in the colony could display the badge in the fly of the Red Ensign. This system is still in operation in the remaining British overseas territories.Weekes, N. (2008). Colonial Flag Badges : A Chronology. A flag badge was duly approved for the Transvaal Colony (formerly the South African Republic), shortly after it had been annexed to the British Empire in 1902. Although landlocked, the colony is believed to have used the defaced Blue Ensign on land.Burgers, A.P. (2008). The South African Flag Book. Description The badge was circular, and showed a lion lying down in the veld. The lion was no doubt derived from the colony's new Public Seal, and it had also featured on the former South African Republic's coat of arms. ReferencesSources * Brownell, F.G. (1993).

Machabeli (sing. ; pl. ·Éõ·Éê·É©·Éê·Éë·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò, Machablebi) was a Georgian princely house (tavadi) which held a large fiefdom (satavado) in the province of Inner Kartli (central Georgia) called Samachablo after their family name. The origin of the family is not clear. According to a traditional account, they descended from one of the princes of the Abkhaz- Georgian feudal clan of Anchabadze who had fled the disorders in Abkhazia. Another version holds it that the Machabeli were an offshoot of the Tavkhelidze family who adopted their dynastic name after the village of Achabeti on the Great Liakhvi River where their initial domain was located. Beginning with the 15th century, the Machabeli grew in prominence and held various important posts at the court of the Georgian kings of Kartli. J. Gvasalia, ·Éõ·Éê·É©·Éê·Éë·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò (Machablebi).

He became an orphan but was fortunate to be adopted by a British Army Officer. As a result, he served in the British Army under the Duke of Wellington. War campaigns In 1801 he entered the British Army at 13 years old where he served in Egypt under Ralph Abercromby to dispossess the French of Egypt. Following this great battle where General Abercromby died, he was transferred under Duke Wellington where he fought in the Napoleonic Wars that raged from 1804 to 1815.

L√≥pez was kidnapped and taken to different clandestine detention centres during the dictatorship known as National Reorganization Process (, 1976‚Äì1983). He was subject to torture and remained detained without formal charges or trial from 21 October 1976 until 25 June 1979. Trial witness, and disappearance About thirty years after the end of the military government, the laws known as Due Obedience and Full Stop, which blocked investigations of crimes committed by members of the military and the police during the dictatorship, were repealed. Miguel Etchecolatz was the first defendant in a Dirty War-related trial. During the first part of the National Reorganization Process, Etchecolatz was the Director of Investigations of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police, head of one of the clandestine detention centres, and the right hand of former General Ram√≥n Camps. L√≥pez was a key witness in his trial. His testimony involved 62 military and policemen, and thanks in part to this, Etchecolatz was sentenced to life imprisonment. Lopez \\"disappeared just hours before he was slated to give his final testimony on the eve of the conviction of the former police investigator,\\" on 18 September 2006, according to the story \\"Missing Witness Awakens Dark Past,\\" by Marie Trigona of the Americas Program of the International Relations Center published on 12 October 2006.Rigona, Maria Argentina: Missing Witness Awakens Dark Past , International Relations Center, 12 October 2006, accessed on 7 February 2008 He was last seen at his home in the city of La Plata, 40 km. south of Buenos Aires. The initial hypothesis, that assumed that L√≥pez had suffered a traumatic shock when reliving his torture during the trial and had subsequently wandered off lost, was discarded. Another hypothesis, that he had gone voluntarily into hiding fearing retribution for his statement against Etchecolatz, was discredited as well.Where is Julio Lopez? Investigation and criticism Government officials made repeated assurances of optimism regarding a quick reappearance, based on \\"substantial advances\\" in the investigation, though evidence of this progress has not been presented to the public. The apparent laziness of the investigators, added to this lack of visible progress, has led some to suspect that information is being withheld or even that there is state complicity in the disappearance. On 8 January 2007 National Deputy Nora Ginzburg proposed a law to create a special bicameral commission to keep Congress informed about the development of the investigations related to L√≥pez, as well as those regarding the kidnapping and later reappearance of Luis Gerez (also a former victim of the dictatorship). The proposal was not adopted. On 15 February Ginzburg made another proposal, requesting that the Executive report information about the cases. This proposal was not adopted either. On 27 February Ginzburg repeated her first proposal; the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Alberto Ballestrini, refused it but allowed voting on the second project. It was rejected 118‚Äì47, with the opposition of the president's party faction, the Front for Victory, and Federal Peronism. The disappearance of the bricklayer sparked criticism of witness protection procedures. After the disappearance, the government of Buenos Aires raised the reward for information on L√≥pez to AR$200,000 (about US$66,000 at the time), and soon doubled the figure. Many television and radio requests for information were broadcast, and pictures of L√≥pez were posted in many places. There was a campaign using mobile phone text messages asking for collaboration on the search. Thousands of policemen were mobilized. , over three years after his disappearance, L√≥pez is yet to be found, but retired police doctor Carlos Osvaldo Falcone, who visited Etchecolatz in prison days before Lopez's disappearance, is to be questioned about the use of a car found at his home reported to have been used to kidnap Lopez.Buenos Aires Herald 2 Feb 10 - After three years of mystery, Julio L√≥pez: retired police doctor to be questioned over witness disappearance Early in 2011, a witness claimed that Lopez's body was buried in the Pereyra Iraola railway station, but the witness was considered unreliable. Suspicions about the cause of L√≥pez's disappearance were strengthened in 2014, when Miguel Etchecolatz and 14 others were convicted in a trial addressing crimes committed at the 'La Cacha' clandestine detention centre, the place where, among others, Laura Carlotto, the daughter of the head of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Estela de Carlotto, was held. As the judge handed down sentences, Etchecolatz took a piece of paper and wrote on it: \\"Jorge Julio L√≥pez.\\" The moment was captured by photographers and when the images were inspected, the other side of the piece of paper could also be read. It said the missing person's name, again, along with the addition of one other word: \\"Kidnap.\\" , Jorge Julio L√≥pez remains missing.

In Europe, especially in Italy, Spain, Portugal and southern France, such towns were common. Castel del Monte (AQ), a little-known Italian hill town The Spanish even brought the traditional European hill town to the Americas, a notable example being the 16th century Mexican hill town of Guanajuato. However, fortified hill towns were by no means solely a European creation. For instance, Incan fortified hill towns predated the arrival of the Spanish by many centuries and rival those of Europe. Machu Picchu, an Incan hill town completed in the mid-15th century in Peru, although now in ruins, is considered perhaps the most beautiful hill town ever constructed. Construction of fortified hill towns was common in many civilizations. Ancient examples can also be found in Africa and Asia. Around the world, the most famous examples are the hilltowns of Darjeeling and Simla. In recent years, Bill Buchanan, Douglas Duany, Lucien Steil and others have studied hill towns with an interest in reviving interest in the enduring form.

Three years later the trio is in 11th grade and the sapling they planted has grown into a tree Venus (named after the Goddess of Love). The girls come from different family backgrounds‚ÄîSarah from a broken home, with her separated parents (Aishwarya and Suresh Gopi) but still she maintain a bold character, Sridevi, who is very much kind and sensitive in nature from a happy, close-knit family, with her parents (Sukanya and Prem Prakash) doting on her, and Pooja, the ambitious one who is the school head girl, who is single parented child staying with her mother (Seetha), whom the trio depend on, when they have problem between themselves. But on other issues, they believe in solving the problems by themselves. Sridevi falls in love with a schoolmate, Sooraj Menon (Skanda Ashok). Though hesitant at first, Sarah and Pooja approve their love after being convinced of Sooraj's sincerity. During an excursion to Goa, Sreedevi and Sooraj make love, and eventually she becomes pregnant, much to the shock of Sarah and Pooja, and moreover herself. They keep the news to themselves, fearing the sorrow and wrath of Sridevi's parents; even Sooraj is kept in the dark, for fear that the news may leak out. They decide to go for an abortion in a small hospital near their school. During the Founder's Day celebrations at the school, the trio sneaks out of the campus, and reaches the hospital. Pooja keeps watch outside the hospital while Sarah and Sridevi go in and they convince the gynecologist for an abortion by telling several lies, including that Sridevi had been raped. During abortion, Sridevi suffers excessive blood loss and dies. Sarah and Pooja flee the hospital in terror and return to school. They are summoned to the principal's office the next day, and the doctor who came to the school as a part of an enquiry identifies Sarah. Sarah confesses that the rape story was a lie and Sridevi actually had sex with somebody she loves, but she maintains she doesn't know who that is. Pooja, who considers her future as important, distances herself from the whole episode, leaving Sarah embarrassed and angry. The principal, who is concerned about the status of the school presses for not registering a police case, dismisses Sarah from the school. Pooja, now ashamed of and disturbed by what she did, tries to apologize to Sarah, but meets with hostility. Pooja loses her mental stability, unable to take the pressure of having lost two best friends together‚Äîone to death and the other to her own betrayal. Years later, on Sarah's graduation day, she receives a letter that claims to be from Sridevi. The letter informs her that Pooja was in a mental asylum for 6 years, and she needs Sarah's company. Sarah, returning to Ooty, finds out that Pooja has been discharged from the mental hospital. They realize how much they missed each other and return to their school campus to Venus (the tree they had planted during their school time).

Early life  Matsis was born in Palaichori Morphou, Cyprus. He received his secondary education at the Famagusta gymnasium and, in 1946, enrolled at the University of Thessaloniki in Greece, from which he obtained his agricultural studies degree. During the years of the Greek Civil War, Matsis traveled in various Greek Army encampments to support the nationalist side. In 1948, he testified as a defence witness in the trial of Yannakis Drousiotis, a Cypriot communist captured by the Army, stating in court that the defendant's motives were \\"pure\\" and \\"not traitorous.\\" Drousiotis was sentenced to death by firing squad but was eventually not executed and survived the war.  EOKA  Matsis, along with his uncle George Matsis, joined EOKA in 1955, soon after the organisation was established by George Grivas, a Greek Cypriot general of the Greek Army, and started armed operations against the British colonial authorities. EOKA was considered a terrorist organisation and all its members terrorists by the authorities. In 1956, Matsis was caught by the British and imprisoned at the Kokkinotrimithia prison. He managed to escape, and fled onto the Pendadactylos area, where he continued working for EOKA, taking up command of military operations in the Kyrenia region.  Death  On 8 November 1958, a bomb exploded in a NAAFI canteen at Nicosia killing two British soldiers and injuring seven others. EOKA did not claim responsibility for the action. Nevertheless, the British authorities intensified their search for Grivas and the chief lieutenants of EOKA, focusing on intelligence from local sources. On 19 November, during a search by the security forces undertaken on the advice of an informer, Kyriakos Matsis along with two other EOKA guerillas were discovered staying at the house of Kyriakos Diakos, in Dikomo, near Kyrenia. Matsis destroyed all the papers and letters he was carrying and directed his comrades to surrender. After he was asked to surrender himself, he eventually responded that if he were to come out, he'd come out shooting. He was killed by a grenade in the gun battle that ensued. His body was buried by the British authorities in the special yard, inside the Central Jail of Nicosia. Subsequent to this operation, it was made clear by the Colonial Office that the military in Cyprus should \\"finish off the job\\" and find Grivas. John Profumo, the junior Office minister, oversaw a special executive order to speed up the flow of military material to the island. The village where Matsis was killed is now under the control of the Northern Cyprus Turkish-Cypriot government. Family His younger brother, Yiannakis Matsis (b.1933), was elected Member of the European Parliament with the group of the European People's Party, from 14 June 2004 until June 2009, when he did not seek re-election.

There is no obligation of the inquiry and the final decision to be executed by the same institution.  History  The procedure of inquisition was already known in Roman law. In the time of the ancient Roman kings inquisition was the standard method of criminal inquiry. There were no rules. The disposal of the magistrate, who acted on pure denunciation, was the criteria which guided the proceedings. Because of these problems, the principle of inquisition was replaced by a principle of contradiction. Pope Innocent III (1161‚Äì1216) reintroduced the procedure of inquisition for canon law, where it became a well-feared instrument against heretics. The concept of inquisition was not limited to canon law. In Italy the use of the inquisition was transferred to secular criminal law. The first adaption within the territory of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation were the Wormser Reformation of 1498 and the Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis of 1507. The adoption of the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (\\"peinliche Gerichtsordnung\\" of Charles V) in 1532 makes the procedure of inquisition empirical law. It was the passage of the code d¬¥ instruction criminelle, the French code of criminal procedure, by Emperor Napoleon of France on November 16, 1808 and the adoption of its principles in German territories that terminated the classical procedure of inquisition in Germany.  Theory of the principle of inquisition  The basic criteria of the procedure of inquisition is the existence of an institution, which carries out ex officio inquiries into cases, presumably committed by a certain person or organization. An accuser (or an informer) is not necessary. Only the results of the all-embracing examination of facts and proofs shall be the base of a final, logical decision without any influence of the injured or the accused litigant. The defendant is a pure object of the proceedings. He has no right to be heard. His participation to the proceedings is limited to the necessities of the lawsuit.  Practical translation to the criminal law of the Holy Roman Empire  Completely new to the criminal procedures of the Middle Ages was the attempt to base the decision of the opening and the sentence on facts, inquired by the court. The law of the Germans only allowed the beginning of a lawsuit on the accusations of the victim. The offender was limited to the positioning of the charge. The only hearing of evidence was the confirmation of the good reputation of the defendant by oath. Notable members of the community, so called helpers by oath (Eidhelfer) described only the reputation of the defendant, not the facts or the circumstances of the crime. There was no witness to the crime involved. In case of good reputation, the charge failed. Only in the case of bad reputation or of confession was a conviction possible. That is the reason why the typical legal conflict of the early Middle Ages was solved by regulated force of arms, which public peace and peace of God alone limited, while legal proceedings were almost an exception. The institution of inquisition was an enormous legal improvement, because it included the proof relating to the facts of the crime to the inquiry. The reputation of the defendant no longer was the main topic of the proceedings. It was replaced by an inquiry, made on real facts. 350px The implementation of the facts practically meant an enormous restriction of the rights of a defendant with good reputation, who now faced a real risk of condemnation. There was a certain discomfort with this risk. Therefore there was still the need for a confession in addition to the results of the inquiry. This confession was to be gained by torture. An innocent was deemed able to withstand the torture with the help of God, and thus would not falsely confess. Contemporaries understand the problem of torture not to be this last proof of findings, long proved by finished inquiries, but an easy way to substitute those inquiries. The criminal law of the Duchy of Lorraine limited the use of torture with the need of approval by the procurateur general, an administrator situated at the ducal court in Nancy. The local court had to ask for the use of torture by presenting the results of its inquiries.  Problems of the inquisition  The greatest problems of the medieval proceeding of inquiry were to be found outside of the principle itself. * The proceedings occurred in secrecy. The maxim of publicity, that is standard today, did not exist. A proceeding without public control always included the risk of a judge who was not able or willing (because of the influence of others, especially his lord) to give a proper judgment. * Torture gave proof to everything. A proceeding that is based on any form of torture will never give results that can be trusted. Torture is only an instrument of manipulation. * There was the danger of denunciation. The Constitutio Carolina did not plan for denunciation. The legal option of a citizen to open legal proceedings was through an accusation. This accuser had to answer for the truth of their accusations. In the case of innocence of the defendant the accuser would be punished.CONSTITUTIO CAROLINA CRIMINALIS, Art. 12, cited from Sellert R√ºping, Studien und Quellenbuch zur Geschichte der deutschen Strafrechtspflege, Bd.1, Von den Anf√§ngen bis zur Aufkl√§rung, S 229: \\"Jtem so balldt der angeclagt zu gegenngknuss Angenommen ist, soll der Anclager oder sein gwallthaber mit seinem leip verwart werden, biss er mit burgenn, Caution vnd bestanndt vnd sicherung, die der Richter mitsampt Vier Schepfenn nach gelegenheit der sache vnd achtung beder personen fur genugsam erkennt, gethan hat,...\\" The other way to begin the proceedings was by the personal knowledge of the authorities. This degenerated into a system of denunciation. In some regions during witch trials a box of denunciation (a box hanging or standing at a public place), was used to enable everyone to make anonymous accusations by inserting a piece of paper without revealing their names, and thus assuming no risk. * The only demerit of the principle of inquisition itself was the lack of neutrality of the judge. He had to decide on the results of an inquiry which only he himself had made. Why should he dispute his own work? This problem can be solved with publicity and the possibility of appeal.  The principle of inquiry in modern proceedings  The principle of inquisition is still in use in modern criminal law in Germany, though to a restricted extent. The legal basis is ¬ß 244 II Strafproze√üordnung (German code of criminal procedure) that orders the court to examine ex officio every fact and proof that could be relevant to a judgment.¬ß 244 II StPO: \\"In order to establish the truth, the court shall, proprio motu, extend the taking of evidence to all facts and means of proof relevant to the decision.\\" Most of these facts or proofs are inserted by the plaintiff or the defendant, but the court has the right to present evidence on its own. The court is even enabled to judge, according to the result of the proceedings, the violation of laws the plaintiff did not mention and to sentence differently from the proposals of the litigants (theoretically an offense of involuntary manslaughter could be raised into a charge and sentence of premeditated murder, for example). If the proceedings show the violation of other laws by the same act, the court is able to pass sentence on these as well.  Inquisition as basic principle  Alternative principles are the principle of contradiction and the principle of consent.

The species of this genus use blackflies (Simulium species) as their definitive host and birds as their intermediate host. There are over 100 species in this genus. Over 100 species of birds have been recorded as hosts to these parasites.  Life cycle  Blood from a chicken infected with a male gametocyte (left) and a female gametocyte (right). Parasites in the genus Leucocytozoon have a life cycle that involves both a bird host, and a black fly (with the exception of Leucocytozoon caulleryi which cycles between a bird host and a biting midge). Parasites enter the bird host in a form called a sporozoite through the bite of the blood-sucking black fly. The sporozoites invade host cells in the liver where they undergo asexual replication, forming numerous daughter cells called merozoites within 4‚Äì5 days. The duration of this stage depends in part upon the species. In some species this stage may occur in the endothelial cells instead of the liver. The newly released merozoites infect either erythrocytes, leukocytes, macrophages or endothelial cells. Those infecting the macrophages or endothelial cells develop into megaloschizonts. The megaloschizonts divide into primary cytomeres, which in turn multiply into smaller cytomeres, which mature into schizonts, which in turn divide into merozoites. In erythrocytes or leukocytes, merozoites develop into gametocytes. The gametocytes are taken up by a blood-sucking fly as it bites the bird host. Gametocytes then mature in the insect midgut into macrogametocytes (female) with red-staining nuclei and microgametocytes (male) with pale-staining diffuse nuclei: these fuse to form an ookinete. The male gametocytes normally give rise to eight microgametes. The ookinete penetrates an intestinal cell of the fly and matures into an oocyst. After several days the oocyst produces ~100 sporozoites that leave and migrate to the salivary glands of the fly. Description The nuclei of the schizonts is enclosed in a trilaminar membrane with peripherally arranged chromatin. The schizonts also contain numerous cytomers also with trilaminar membranes and containing multiple ribosomes. Repeated invagination of the cytomeres gives rise to the merozoites which also have a trilaminar membrane. The merozoites have rhoptries, micronemes and three apical rings. The mitochondrion contains vesicular cristae. There may be one or two paranuclear bodies in some species. Their function is unknown. Two gametocyte forms are recognised: an elongated (sail- like) form and a compact spherical form. These are usually 12-14 micrometres long. The large gametocytes tend to grossly distort the infected cells and make cell identification difficult. A pseudopigment known as volutin may be present. Evolution It has been suggested that this genus arose in the late Oligocene or early Eocene at about the same time as Piciformes and Coraciiformes. Taxonomy The genus is divided into two subgenera: Akiba and Leucocytozoon ‚Äî based on the vector species. The only known member of the subgenus Akiba is Leucocytozoon (Akiba) caulleryi which uses members of the genus Culicoides as its vectors. The remaining species in the genus use members of the genus Simulium as their vectors. In 1977, Greiner and Kocan in an extensive examination of species in the order Falconiformes declared that the only valid species infecting this order was L. toddi. L. dubreuili is considered to be restricted to the family Turdidae; L. fringillinarum is considered to be restricted to several passiform families; and L. majoris is considered restricted to the family Paridae. L. ziemanni infects owls.  Diagnostic criteria  Form gamonts in white blood cells and/or erythrocytes. Gametocytes cause marked enlargement and distortion of the infected cell producing a football-like appearance. No merogony occurs in either leucocytes or erythrocytes. Merogony occurs in the parenchyma of liver, heart, kidney, or other organs. Meronts may form large bodies divided into cytomeres. Hemozoin deposits (pigment) are not formed ‚Äî a useful distinguishing feature for Leucocytozoon from Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. Oocysts develop rapidly in 3‚Äì5 days. The oocysts are small and nonexpanding, reaching 13 micrometres in diameter and typically have less than 100 short, thick sporozoites. The vectors are Simulium or Culicoides species. The vertebrate hosts are birds. Type species: Leucocytozoon ziemanni  Pathology  The typical pathology of infection with these parasites includes anaemia and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Gross lesions also include pulmonary congestion and pericardial effusion. Megaloschizonts appear as grey-white nodules found in the heart, liver, lung or spleen. Microscopically there is ischemic necrosis and associated inflammation in the heart, brain, spleen and liver due to occlusion of blood vessels by megaloschizonts in endothelial cells. Ruptured schizonts may induce granulomatous reactions in the surrounding tissues. Clinically the majority of birds affected with leucocytozoonosis exhibit no signs. Among those that do the signs include mild to severe signs of anorexia, ataxia, weakness, anemia, emaciation and difficulty breathing. The excess mortality due to Leucocytozoon in adult birds seems to occur as a result of debilitation and increased susceptibility to secondary infection.  Epidemiology  L. simondi is suspected to be a major parasite of Canada geese in some areas, including the upper Midwestern United States and Canada. L. smithi affects turkey farms in the southeastern United States.

A more detailed description of parasites resembling Leucocytozoon was published in 1894 by N. Sakharoff from the blood of birds near Tbilisi. Soon thereafter in 1898, Hans Ziemann described a Leucocytozoon parasite from the blood of the owl Athene noctua, naming it Leukocytozoen danilewskyi in honor of Danilewsky. N. M. Berestneff was the first to use the current genus name Leucocytozoon while describing parasites he called Leucocytozoon danilewskyi from several common birds. The genus was subsequently formally defined in 1908 by Louis Sambon, and has remained largely unchanged since. In 1930 and 1931, Earl O'Roke and Louis V. Skidmore independently discovered black flies to be the vector of Leucocytozoon species.

She's French (shown in the United States as She Gets What She Wants), is a 2002 teen comedy film directed by Melanie Mayron and starring Piper Perabo. Plot High school student Starla Grady is the popular head cheerleader and pageant queen of the small town of Splendora, Texas, who aspires to be a news anchorwoman. She hosts a French foreign exchange student, an orphan named Genevieve Le Plouff. After winning the affections of Starla's parents, friends, and boyfriend, Genevieve soon begins to take over Starla's life. When Starla is forced to quit the cheerleading squad after receiving a failing grade in French, Genevieve moves in to take her place, and then the roles are reversed. Soon, Genevieve is the popular head cheerleader, and Starla is the unpopular student. Genevieve also takes Starla's place in the News Anchor Competition, and, framed by Genevieve, Starla is arrested for possessing a knife and getting high on mushrooms. She is then bailed out of jail by her brother Randolph and her classmate Ed Mitchell. Starla eventually learns that Genevieve was, in fact, a former elementary school classmate named Clarissa Fogelsey, whom Starla had embarrassed so much that she felt compelled to move to France and has come back in disguise to get revenge on Starla. With her charade exposed, Genevieve leaves town in disgrace and Starla reclaims her status in school and town. Although Starla never achieved her ambition of becoming a reporter nor getting a college scholarship, she now feels that she is a changed person. Meanwhile, Genevieve, posing as Starla, is welcomed by her new adoptive French family upon her arrival in Paris.
