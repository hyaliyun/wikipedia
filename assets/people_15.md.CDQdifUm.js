The work was commissioned by the flutist James Galway and it is based on the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The piece was given its world premiere by Galway and the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the conductor Myung-whun Chung at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on February 4, 1982. In 1993, the critic Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"one of the best known of modern American concertos.\\" Composition =Background= The flutist James Galway first approached John Corigliano about writing a flute concerto for him in 1978. The composer was initially apprehensive about writing another concerto for a woodwind instrument, having recently completed his Oboe Concerto in 1975 and his Clarinet Concerto in 1977. Corigliano postponed committing himself to the project, but kept it in mind. In the meantime, Corigliano studied Galway's performance techniques and began studying legends surrounding flutes and tin whistles. This led him to the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin and to the idea of casting Galway as the Piper in his own flute concerto. The composer recalled in the program notes, \\"Galway as the Piper seemed the most natural thing in the world, for to many, myself included, he is a kind of Pied Piper... Here, the mating of personality and instrument could hardly be better.\\" He added, \\"But what was even more exciting was that this could offer me a new way of writing a wind concerto. The idea of a programmatic fantasy-concerto based on the Pied Piper legend became a fascinating structural challenge. I contacted Galway with the proposal of writing a Pied Piper Fantasy and, with his approval, started planning the work.\\" Corigliano partially based the form of the work on Robert Browning's narrative poem \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin,\\" arguably the most famous version of the tale. However, the composer altered the narrative to better fit a musical setting, explaining, \\"The biggest problem was that the legend per se had no elements of virtuosity in it; the Pied Piper played his song to charm the rats and lead them to destruction and piped a march to lead the children away from Hamelin, but there were no actual confrontations or tensions that could lead me to write virtuosically for the soloist. So I had to modify the story a bit, and I included battle scenes between the Piper and the rats and other elements that could set the soloist‚Äôs fingers racing.\\" He added, \\"In restructuring the legend I had to provide a logical continuity for this story, but I also had to produce a satisfying purely musical structure so that the piece worked as a concerto for flute and orchestra too.\\" =Structure= The Pied Piper Fantasy has a duration of roughly 38 minutes and is composed in seven movements played without pause: #Sunrise and the Piper's Song #The Rats #Battle with the Rats #War Cadenza #The Piper's Victory #The Burgher's Chorale #The Children's March The first movement \\"Sunrise and the Piper's Song\\" illustrates the sunrise with \\"pointillistic night sounds\\" culminating in an orchestral tutti; it also introduces the \\"Piper's Song,\\" which reappears throughout the work. The second movement \\"The Rats\\" uses the orchestra to simulate the squeaking and scurrying sounds of the rodents. In \\"Battle with the Rats,\\" the soloist enters as the Piper and competes for dominance over the \\"rats\\" represented by the orchestra. In \\"War Cadenza,\\" the battle continues, featuring an extended cadenza from the soloist. In \\"The Piper's Victory,\\" the \\"Piper's Song\\" reemerges as the Piper hypnotizes and finally defeats the rats. With \\"The Burgher‚Äôs Chorale,\\" the townspeople of Hamelin are represented by a \\"pompous\\" chorale accompanied by a bass drum; the orchestra proceeds in a coarse dialogue with the soloist, until the Piper can take no more. In the final movement \\"The Children's March,\\" the soloist switches from flute to tin whistle as he begins lure the town's children away; for this movement, a group of child performers hidden amongst the audience begin to play and eventually follow the Piper onto the stage and out of the performance hall, leaving the sorrowful orchestra behind. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a solo flute (doubling tin whistle or piccolo) and a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (2nd doubling piccolo; 3rd flute optional), three oboes, three clarinets (3rd doubling E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, four percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), and strings. The score also calls for a group of child performers consisting of 9 to 18 flutists and two drums interspersed among the audience; this group plays only during the final movement, \\"The Children's March,\\" when they gather on stage before following the soloist out of the performance hall. Reception The Pied Piper Fantasy has been praised by some music critics. Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune observed, \\"Corigliano gives exuberant rein to his eclecticism in this seven-movement programmatic retelling of the Pied Piper of Hamelin legend, combining Brittenish lyricism, new-fangled splashes of dissonance, old-fashioned virtuoso gestures (for both flute and tin whistle) and amusing onomatopoeic effects (the scurrying, squeaking music for the rats) with his usual craftsmanlike skill.\\" Edward Reichel of Deseret News said the concerto \\"shows Corigliano at his most colorful and descriptive in terms of orchestration and melodic inventiveness.\\" Not all criticism was positive, however. Despite saying it was \\"expertly tailored as a vehicle for the virtuosity and the highly individual timbre of James Galway,\\" Michael Oliver of Gramophone was critical of all but the final movement, writing, \\"...of strong ideas strong enough to sustain a structure nearly 40 minutes in length, there is not a sign. Even that modestly effective finale plays for nine-and-a- half minutes, approximately seven minutes longer than its several-times- repeated material will bear and none of the other movements has half its character.\\" Reviewing a recording of the piece with other flute concertos, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle compared the work unfavorably to Chen Yi's The Golden Flute, remarking, \\"[Corigliano's] writing is full of illustrative goodies -- you can hear the rats march in and out, hear the townsfolk react and even hear the children being spirited away by the piper's golden tones.\\" He continued, \\"But it's not clear that Corigliano's theatrical bonbon, a concert entertainment written for James Galway and based on Browning's poem, is the most interesting music on offer here.\\" See also *List of compositions by John Corigliano References Category:Concertos by John Corigliano Category:1982 compositions Category:Flute concertos Category:Works based on Pied Piper of Hamelin Category:Music commissioned by ensembles or performers Category:Music based on fairy tales ","title":"Pied Piper Fantasy"},{"id":"50494328","text":"James Simpson Fleming FRSE (1828-1899) was a Scottish lawyer and banker.

He was educated locally then apprenticed as a lawyer. He then went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews. In March 1847 he began working at the Western Bank of Scotland in Glasgow, leaving in 1852 to set up his own legal practic. He returned to the bank in 1854 combining his two skills as the bank's legal adviser. He rose to become sole manager of the bank. His investigation of financial irregularities at the bank led to it ceasing trading in November 1857 (a major scandal of the day). Fleming assisted in the bank's liquidation. At this time Fleming was living at 9 Park Street East in Glasgow.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1871 After a period practising law he again turned to bank work, and in 1871 became Senior cashier and General Manager of the Royal Bank of Scotland. During the next ten years Fleming made major improvements to the company, bringing it to the forefront of Scottish banking. This included a critical move in 1873 to establish a base in London requiring a change in the original 1727 legal conditions upon the bank, limiting it to practice only in Scotland. In 1875 Fleming's knowledge successfully fended off a challenge by the English banks, objecting to the Scottish invasion. In 1878 Fleming also advised during the massive collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank. In 1876 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

The highway connects the Georgia state line and the Ware Shoals area, via Antreville, Due West, and Donalds. Route description SC 184 begins at the Georgia state line, where the roadway crosses over the Savannah River and enters that state on the Sgt. Fred M. Newton Bridge as Georgia State Route 368 (Anderson Highway). It begins to travel through Anderson in an east-northeast direction and then curves to the north-northwest before an intersection with SC 187\\\\. It curves to the northeast and crosses over Little Generostee Creek before entering Iva. The highway turns right onto Hamilton Street. It has a concurrency with SC 81\\\\. At East Green Street, it meets the southern terminus of SC 413\\\\. The two highways travel concurrently to the southeast for one block, where SC 413 splits off onto East Front Street. SC 184 then travels to the northeast, leaves Iva, and crosses East Beards Creek. It starts heading east, and crosses over Lake Secession, into Abbeville County, on an unnamed bridge. It then travels through part of Lake Secession and curves to the southeast before entering Antreville. There, it begins a concurrency with SC 28/SC 284\\\\. Right after leaving the city limits, SC 284 leaves the concurrency. Approximately later, SC 184 splits off to the northeast and crosses over Spur Creek. It winds its way through rural areas of the county and crosses over Johnson Creek. A short distance later is an intersection with SC 201 and a crossing of the Little River. SC 184 crosses over Hogskin Creek and Chickasaw Creek before entering Due West. In town, it begins a concurrency with SC 20/SC 185 (Anderson Drive). The three highways pass by Erskine Theological Seminary and Erskine College. At College Street, SC 20/SC 185 splits off, while SC 184 continues to the northeast. In Donalds, it has a very brief concurrency with U.S. Route 178 (US 178). Farther to the northeast, it crosses over Turkey Creek before it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SC 252.

The painting was commissioned in 1817, started in 1822, finished in 1824, and is now on view in the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C., along with three other large-scale paintings by Trumbull about the American Revolutionary War. Trumbull considered George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief to be \\"one of the highest moral lessons ever given to the world\\". Commission Congress commissioned Trumbull on January 27, 1817 to paint four Revolutionary War scenes to be displayed in the rotunda of the Capitol, including what would become the popular Declaration of Independence, and allocated $32,000 for the work. Trumbull then had a meeting with President James Madison to determine the final size and subjects. Trumbull initially thought that the paintings should be six feet high by nine feet long, but Madison stated that the vast size of the rotunda demanded full life-sized works. The military subjects selected were the Surrender of General Burgoyne and the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis. The civil subjects were the Declaration of Independence balanced by General George Washington Resigning His Commission. Trumbull recommended the painting of George Washington resigning, and Madison responded, \\"I believe you are right; it was a glorious action\\". Description General George Washington is shown in full military uniform, illuminated in the middle of the painting as he addresses the Continental Congress. Standing behind him are his aides-de-camp Col. David Humphreys and Col. Benjamin Walker. Standing on the left are President of the Continental Congress Thomas Mifflin and Secretary of the Continental Congress Charles Thomson. Martha Washington and her three grandchildren are shown in the gallery on the right, although they were not actually in attendance. Future Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison are shown among the delegates. Trumbull told Madison that he had used artistic license to include him in the painting. Other congressional delegates include Elbridge Gerry, Hugh Williamson, Samuel Osgood, Eleazer McComb, George Partridge, Richard Dobbs Spaight, and Benjamin Hawkins. Also standing behind Washington are General William Smallwood, General Otho Holland Williams, Col. Samuel Smith, Col. John Eager Howard, and Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, spectators from Maryland, and Maryland delegate Charles Carroll with his two daughters. Trumbull used his 1792 portrait General George Washington at Trenton as the model for Washington in this work. He used several of his miniature portraits from 1790 to 1793 for the other people in attendance, including Thomas Mifflin, William Smallwood, and Martha Washington. Other versions Trumbull painted a smaller version () entitled The Resignation of General Washington, December 23, 1783 (1824‚Äì1828) that is now on view at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. An engraving from the central portion of the full-sized painting was used on the reverse of the $1,000 National Bank Note, Series 1875, and the $5,000 Federal Reserve Note, Series 1918. Critical reception Trumbull described the painting in the catalogue for his exhibited works at Yale University in 1835: Historian Matthew Moten wrote about this painting in the conclusion to his 2014 book on the American history of command in war: Gallery File:The Resignation of General Washington December 23 1783.jpegThe Resignation of General Washington, December 23, 1783, by John Trumbull, 1824‚Äì1828 File:Gen.

TV show Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture. The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005. =Spin-off= MacFarlane co-created‚Äîalongside Mike Henry and Richard Appel‚Äîthe Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, which premiered September 27, 2009. They began discussing the project in 2007. Appel and Henry served as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to- day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane. Henry and Appel conceived the show as \\"more of a family show, a sweeter show\\" than Family Guy. The first season consisted of 22 episodes, and the show was picked up by Fox for a second season, which consisted of 13 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009, before the first season began. It was extended to a full second season. Appel signed a new three-year, seven-figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on The Cleveland Show in 2010. Fox chairman Gary Newman commented: \\"What is special about him is his incredible leadership ability.\\" The show follows the Family Guy character Cleveland Brown, who is voiced by Henry, as he leaves the town of Quahog and moves with his son to start his own adventure. Fox canceled The Cleveland Show on May 13, 2013, roughly a week before the May 19 conclusion of its fourth season. On July 16, 2013, MacFarlane confirmed an upcoming twelfth season episode of Family Guy centering on Cleveland's return to Quahog. =Crossovers with other series= An event known as \\"Night of the Hurricane\\" depicts a hurricane hitting the hometowns of MacFarlane's sitcoms Family Guy, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show, culminating in a stand-off among the three fathers of each family. It was announced that a special episode of Family Guy featuring an official crossover with The Simpsons would premiere in 2014. At San Diego Comic Con a 5-minute preview was shown. The episode, titled \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", was aired September 28, 2014. The series may crossover with MacFarlane's other series, The Orville. Merchandise As of 2009, six books have been released about the Family Guy universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. The first, Family Guy: Stewie's Guide to World Domination () by Steve Callahan, was released on April 26, 2005. Written in the style of a graphic novel, the plot follows Stewie's plans to rule the world. Other books include Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One (), which covers the events of the episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\"; and Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded (), a collection of 17 essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. A book written from Brian's point of view (written by Andrew Goldberg) was published in 2006, called Brian Griffin's Guide to Booze, Broads and the Lost Art of Being a Man. Family Guy has been commercially successful in the home market. The show was the first to be resurrected because of high DVD sales. The first volume, covering the show's first two seasons, sold 1.67 million units, topping TV DVD sales in 2003, while the second volume sold another million units. Volumes six and seven debuted at fifth place in United States DVD sales; volume seven was the highest-selling television DVD, selling 171,000 units by June 21, 2009. Family Guy Presents Blue Harvest, the DVD featuring the Star Wars special \\"Blue Harvest\\", was released on January 15, 2008, and premiered at the top of United States DVD sales. The DVD was the first Family Guy DVD to include a digital copy for download to the iPod. In 2004, the first series of Family Guy toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz; each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures were released, with various forms of Peter. In 2008, the character Peter appeared in advertisements for Subway Restaurants, promoting the restaurant's massive feast sandwich. Other media =Books= Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One was written by executive story editor Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and actress Alex Borstein. The book was first published on May 8, 2007. The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin discussing her memories of growing up and to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog. Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin. The book covers events featured in the Family Guy episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", with which it shares a title. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 by Orion Books.It Takes A Village Idiot, And I Married One. Orion Books; retrieved on December 26, 2008 A comic book based on the Family Guy universe was produced. Published by Titan Comics, edited by Steve White and illustrated by Anthony Williams and S. L. Gallant. The writing and the illustrations will be supervised by the show's producers. The first comic book was released on July 27, 2011. Inside Family Guy will be released in May 2019, as part of the series' 20th anniversary. =Live performances= As promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, \\"[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans\\", Fox organized four Family Guy Live! performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the Family Guy: Live in Vegas comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival. The Family Guy Live! performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each. In 2007, at the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song \\"The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C.\\" performed in the episode PTV. The song insulted TV shows such as Two and a Half Men, Desperate Housewives, and Scrubs, as well as the final scene of The Sopranos. In 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show, in which voice actors Alex Borstein and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of Lady Gaga's song \\"Poker Face\\" in the voice of Marlee Matlin, who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show. =Film= On July 22, 2007, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although \\"nothing's official.\\" In TV Week on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released Family Guy feature film sometime \\"within the next year.\\" He came up with an idea for the story, \\"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie.\\" He later went to say he imagines the film to be \\"an old-style musical with dialogue\\" similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would \\"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel.\\" On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt. On November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a Family Guy film. The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on Ted 2. =Video games= The Family Guy Video Game! is a 2006 action game released by 2K Games and developed by High Voltage Software. The game received mixed reviews, averaging 50% favorable reviews for the PlayStation 2 version, 51% for the PlayStation Portable version, and 53% for the Xbox version, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game received praise for its humor, but was criticized for its short playtime and \\"uninteresting gameplay\\". On November 2, 2009, IGN journalist Ryan Langley reported the production of a Family Guy-based party game for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. He cited the LinkedIn profiles of former HB Studios developer Chris Kolmatycki and Invisible Entertainment co-owner Ron Doucet, which stated that the individuals had worked on the game. MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Peter's voice and other Family Guy characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball. A game called Family Guy Online was launched into public beta in April 2012, but permanently shut down on January 18, 2013.

The nave, aisles and porch are 15th century, with the tower dating from about 1500. The tower has angle buttresses, uncommon in Pembrokeshire, and in 1842 was noted as having turrets (pinnacles) and a spire. The pinnacles were removed in the 19th century and the spire in the 20th century. A number of other alterations, externally and internally, were made during the 19th century, including to roofing and windows. Tombs and memorials In the chancel are the tombs of Sir Nicholas de Carew (died 1311, who built the Edwardian castle) and Sir John and Elizabeth Carew. There are memorials to members of the Allen and other leading families. The west window is an 1857 Crimea memorial.

Although her exact date of birth is unknown, she was most likely born between 1526 and 1545, and died around 1589. Like her origins, most of her life remains a mystery. She is mostly known for her poetic discourse on the superiority of women, as well as an attributed French translation of a work by Italian author Alessandro Piccolomini, which provided behavioral and societal instructions for young ladies and their mothers.  Background  Besides her place of birth, not much else is known about de Romieu; her occupation, education and background vary according to the source. Some sources place her as a noblewoman who frequented the French court, even naming her as a favorite lover of King Henry III.  Family  The biographical information concerning Marie de Romieu is scarce at best. She had a brother, Jacques de Romieu, also a poet, who was her publisher and mentor. French author and archivist Auguste Le Sourd claims the family was composed of bakers in Viviers, although this account is widely disputed due to Marie's level of education. Another theory places both Marie and Jacques in the entourage of their supposed beneficiary, Jean de Chastellier, the finance minister for kings Charles IX and Henry III. In her poems, she mentions a son and the press of certain domestic duties, thus implying that she was married, and had at least one son . Her poems also reveal that she wanted to be a full-time writer and scholar; the preface of her poetic collection states that she wrote it in great haste, because she had no free time due to her household duties.  Education  The only clue into Marie de Romieu's education is found through her body of work, which was heavily influenced by Pierre de Ronsard and classical writers such as Hesiod, Ovid and Virgil. It is speculated that she either learned from her brother Jacques, or at least shared some of his lessons. In 1584, some of her works appear as introductory poems in her brother's poetic anthology, which included Latin translations. Since her poetry included translations of Renaissance Neo- Latin Poets, it can be inferred that she was proficient in Latin, which suggests a higher level of education than most women, and one only attained by those in the elite. She may also have been fluent in Italian due to her translations of Italian authors such as Petrarch. However, her fluency in Italian is not certain, for French translations of the works were available at the time.  Translations  A good part of de Romieu's work consists of translations of works by Classical, Neo-Latin and Italian poets, which was not uncommon during the time period. The translation of classical and humanist texts was widespread during the Renaissance in France, which in turn lead to more women gaining access to more advanced education. Marie de Romieu was part of this trend, as well as other 16th century French women poets, such as Marie de Gournay, Anne de Graville and Madeleine des Roches.  Identity Controversy  Because of the lack of accurate biographical data, there has been some controversy over the veracity of Marie de Romieu's authorship of her Discourse over the superiority of women over men, which appeared in her Les Premi√®res Oeuvres Po√©tiques (1581), as well of the translation Instruction for Young Women (1572). The Discourse, published by her brother Jacques de Romieu, has been attributed to Jacques himself by some critics. However, according to French poet Guillaume Colletet, Marie's style in her Premi√®res Oeuvres is more refined than that of her brother's, which was ‚Äúrough and hard‚Äù in his own work. In the translation of Instruction for Young Women, the only reference to an author refers to the initials M.D.R., which could belong to her, but also to other French authors of the time besides Marie, such as Madeleine des Roches.  Instructions pour les jeunes dames (1572)  One of the works most widely attributed to Marie de Romieu, Instruction for Young Women, was the French translation of Alessandro Piccolomini‚Äôs Dialogo dove si ragiona della bella creanza delle done, dello Stordito accademico Intronato. This particular work, signed solely by the initials M.D.R., appeared in later editions as The Messenger of Love and Instructions to Incite Young Ladies to Love. The premise of the work was to instruct young ladies to lead a virtuous and pure path.  Les Premi√®res Oeuvres Po√©tiques (1581)  First page of Marie de Romieu's \\"Les Pr√©mi√®res Oeuvres\\" The first work signed by ‚ÄúMarie de Romieu‚Äù surfaced in Paris in 1581, titled Les Premi√®res Oeuvres Po√©tiques de ma Damoiselle Marie de Romieu Vivaroise. A sort of anthology of verse, it contained occasional brief pieces flattering some authority figures in Viviers. Premi√®res Oeuvres features de Romieu's discourse on the superiority of women as its opening piece. The entirety of the work was made up of a mixture of styles common to the Renaissance which included elegies, eclogues, odes, sonnets and hymns.  Brief discours: Que l‚Äôexcellence de la femme surpasse celle de l‚Äôhomme  Page of \\"Les Pr√©mi√®res Oeuvres Po√©tiques\\" containing the beginning of Marie de Romieu's \\"Brief dicsourse\\". Perhaps the most widely known work associated with Marie de Romieu, her Brief discourse on the superiority of woman over man, was a response to an anti-feminist text penned by her brother, Jacques. Some critics attribute Jacques as the actual author of the Discourse, but this theory has been mostly rejected due to stylistic differences. Featured as the first piece in Premi√®res Oeuvres, de Romieu's discourse on the superiority of women builds itself by praising the courage, wit and virtue of women. It argues that women were visibly more beautiful than their male counterparts because they were a refined product from man, who had been made with clay. In her discourse, de Romieu asserts that women were superior to men in their sacrifices and charity work. She condemns men who fault women for their failings and for leading them astray, claiming they are responsible for their own actions. She also accuses men of trying to deliberately deceive women with ‚Äòfine words‚Äô and goes into great detail elaborating the different types of deception perpetrated by men: those who cite God's will and authority, those who pose as protectors of female virtue, or those who pretend to 'serve' women. Furthermore, she illustrates women as the source of learning, both in ancient times and her own. In her conclusion, she reasons that life without women would be lacking in social graces and virtues; she also points out that it is not by accident that the classical virtues are depicted as women. Besides her focus on the superiority of women, Marie de Romieu discusses the male sex as well. She recognizes \\"men of courage\\", \\"men of knowledge\\", and the general grandeur of men, but wonders what exactly her society values in such men, such as their courage, their spirit, their magnificence, their honor or their excellence. She also questions if her society values those men due to their virtues or simply due to the fact they were men. Marie de Romieu's discourse is closely based on part of a 1554 work by Charles Estienne, titled Paradoxes, which are notions contrary to the common opinion. Estienne's work, in turn, was itself based on Paradoxes, a work by Italian humanist author Ortensio Lando. Lando's piece was mainly a list of ‚Äúexemplary ladies‚Äù, while Estienne builds onto that by omitting some Italian names and adding some French ladies to it. De Romieu, however, took it further. She follows Estienne's prose, adding women she thought were deserving of praise. She paid special attention to the role of educated women, especially her contemporary female poets, praising in her Discourse other French female writers, such as Catherine de Clermont, Marguerite de Navarre, and Madeleine and Catherine des Roches. Notably, she removed the names of women who were entirely devoted to serving their husbands, as well as women who attempted to hide their accomplishments from public view. The greatest difference between de Romieu's Brief Discourse and Estienne's Paradoxes can be found within the author's voice. Marie de Romieu's is distinctly a woman's voice, showcasing true indignity at the idea that it is women who lead men astray. She proceeds to thoroughly develop on the notion that men are at fault, attempting to seduce women with their wily ways. De Romieu then accuses them of blaming guileless women for the seduction they impose upon their innocence. She attributes the injustice to man's ignorance, comparing him to a ‚Äúcock who cannot distinguish between a pearl and a stone‚Äù. Furthermore, while Estienne's audience was primarily masculine, de Romieu speaks to multiple audiences. She addresses women, including herself, as ‚Äúus, women‚Äù and ‚Äúwe, my ladies‚Äù, as well as a universal and neutral ‚Äúone‚Äù. She utilizes those when presenting dialogue in which a masculine voice presents arguments that are subsequently countered by her own female voice.  The Querelle des Femmes  Marie de Romieu weighs in in the Querelle des Femmes, or the woman question a generation before early feminists associated with the theme, famously from Lyons, such as Louise Lab√© and Pernette du Guillet. While she comes to the defense of women, she almost never establishes her own voice on issues such as love, marriage, or life in general, unlike the female poets that came after. She seemed to opt for imitating what she considered the best poetry, regardless of whether it was made by a man or a woman. Differing from Lab√©, Marie de Romieu's love poems focus firstly on her patron's love for others and, secondly, as a translation exercise. De Romieu does not open up about her own emotions or preferences, other than the importance of education. In a particular sonnet, addressed to her son, she reminds him that the only lasting virtue is knowledge  Bibliography  * Br√©e, Germaine. Women Writers in France: Variations on a Theme.

Opened in the 1850s, it was rebuilt in 1899 and again in 1954 by the New Haven Railroad. It closed in 1972, then reopened from 1978 to 1981 for use by the Amtrak Beacon Hill. A new station has since been proposed to be built in Niantic to serve the Shore Line East commuter rail service. History =Former stations= The New Haven & New London Railroad was charted in 1848, began construction in 1850, and opened for service in July 1852. East Lyme station, located at the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue, may have opened slightly later than other stations on the line. The line was owned by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (the \\"Stonington Road\\") from 1858 to 1862, and by the Shore Line Railway from 1864 until it was acquired by the New Haven Railroad in 1870. As Niantic grew to exceed East Lyme proper in population - particularly after Camp Niantic opened in 1873 - the station was renamed East Lyme and Niantic. The 1899-built station shown on a postcard mailed in 1915 The original station burned on September 23, 1898. It was replaced in early 1899 by a saltbox style station similar to others that the New Haven built that decade. The station was heavily used by soldiers traveling to Camp Niantic for maneuvers, as well as by spectators. The station was little-used by mid-century; it was divided into retail stores in 1954, and a by wooden shelter was constructed nearby. The 1899-built station building was destroyed by fire on August 22, 1970, and demolished in early September. Most commuter service east of New Haven ceased on January 1, 1969, after the New Haven merged into Penn Central, though the Clamdigger continued operation under Penn Central and later Amtrak until January 28, 1972. In 1975, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT) made plans to restore commuter rail service between New Haven and New London, with a twice-daily Clamdigger making the same stops as the pre-1972 train, including to the former Niantic station (now to be named simply East Lyme); although negotiations with Penn Central were successful, budgetary constraints prevented these plans from coming to fruition. A second version of the Clamdigger operated from September 9, 1976 to October 30, 1977, but it did not stop at Niantic. The Clamdigger was reinstated on January 8, 1978, with commuter-based flag stops added at Groton, Clinton, Madison, Stony Creek, and Branford - but still not Niantic. The Clamdigger was replaced by the Boston-New Haven Beacon Hill effective April 30, 1978. The decaying wooden shelter had been torn down by the local Jaycees on February 18 of that year as a civic improvement project, so the Niantic 'station' consisted of \\"a strip of gravel dumped between two yellow two-by-fours\\". Ridership west of Providence on the Beacon Hill was light; the first passenger to use the Niantic flag stop was a New London Day reporter on the service's third day. The Beacon Hill was discontinued on October 1, 1981, ending service to Niantic a second time. =Shore Line East= Shore Line East commuter service began between New Haven and Old Saybrook on May 29, 1990. Beginning in 1996, some Shore Line East trips were extended eastward to New London; however, they did not make any stops between Old Saybrook and New London. In April 2012, a state report was released detailing four possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Two of the sites were near downtown Niantic (one at the Niantic River Bridge to the east, and the other at Hole in the Wall Beach to the west), while the other two were in Rocky Neck State Park. A 2015 bonding proposal from Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy allocated $750,000 to the planning and construction of a new station and parking lot in Niantic (out of an estimated $30,000,000 required to bring the new station fully into service).

Early life Isidore Spielmann was born into a Jewish family in London in 1854, the son of the banker Adam Spielmann (1812‚Äì1869), one of three brothers who had emigrated from Schokken (now Skoki), near Posen (now Poznan, following the Partitions of Poland. Isidore had seven siblings, several of whom died in infancy or in young adulthood, but the two surviving brothers were equally celebrated figures: Sir Meyer Spielmann (1856‚Äì1936) was primarily concerned with education and youth-rehabilitation and was knighted in 1928, but he was also an art collector himself; Marion Spielmann (1858‚Äì1948) was the youngest and received no honours, but was a renowned art critic in his time and arguably the most influential of the three in the art world of the Edwardian era. Isidore's nephews and nieces included the women's suffrage campaigner Eva Hubback. Isidore's own career was in civil engineering and he was awarded the CMG, before he began his second career. Art Impresario Spielman compiled the book, Royal Commission : St. Louis International Exhibition, 1904, an account of the British exhibition at the St. Louis World's Fair, which he took part in organizing. The book was published by the Royal Commission in 1906. Sir Isidore Spielmann was awarded a knighthood in 1905. Spielmann was Britain's Commissioner for Art for the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition. Family life Spielmann married Emily Sebag-Montefiore (1859-1929) and they had five children. Lady Spielmann was the elder, and only surviving, daughter of Sir Joseph Sebag-Montefiore, the son of Solomon Sebag and Sarah Montefiore; Sir Joseph's uncle was the famous Sir Moses Montefiore, Bt. and on the baronet's death in 1885, the Sebag surname was altered by royal licence, in fulfillment of the legacy, initiating the new branch of the family. Lady Spielmann's last address was 56 Westbourne Terrace, London, W.She had a posthumous sale of the family silver at Christie's, London, 14 May 1929, lots 10-22. The younger of the two sons, Harold Spielmann, was killed at Gallipoli in 1915, as a 23-year old Captain in 10th Bn., the Manchester Regiment. The eldest daughter, Dora Marian Spielmann married Laurie Magnus, heir to the Magnus baronetcy, but he narrowly predeceased his father and it was their sons who continued that line; two of the daughters married a distant cousin from the Sebag-Montefiores, further bonding 'the Cousinhood'. The youngest daughter, Adelaide (1895-1961), married Lionel Cohen, Lord Cohen, the distinguished Law Lord from another well-known banking dynasty.

Affected eyes do not have the ability to open and close properly. In severe cases, a person is not able to open the affected eyelid. Ptosis eye crutches are tools installed to existing eyewear that support the affected eyelid, enabling the eyelid to stay open and allowing an individual to see.  Medical uses  Crutches are used to keep an eyelid from drooping due to Ptosis. Individuals with Ptosis who are not candidates for reparable surgery or are looking for an alternative treatment, may consider Ptosis crutches. A Ptosis crutch is bar that is placed along the inside of an eyewire frame that supports the drooping eyelid. The crutch is positioned where the orbital fold would typically be without Ptosis. The crutch should create a fold above the eye, tucking the lid in and raising it above the pupil. The Ptosis crutch is designed around the shape and contour of the eye. It is typically made out of metal wire. To create the crutch, measurements must be first taken to determine the depth of the Ptosis eye crutch. An optician may use a distometer or a millimeter ruler to take measurements. The distometer is held against the ocular side of the frame, at the middle of the upper eyewire. Measurements are then taken from the deepest point under the eyelid, up to where it meets the overhang of the eyewear's eyewire. Most measurements come in between 15 and 20 millimeters, but extended or reduced lengths may occur too. It is important that the eyewear is properly adjusted to the back of the ears. Sometimes cable temples are recommendable for optimal functionality. Ptosis crutches are a little-known option and are an alternative to surgery or eyelids that may not be currently repairable. Many optometrists may be unaware of it or may not know how to install the crutch on an existing pair of eyeglasses. A number of eyeglass companies can install Ptosis crutches to new or existing frames.  Types of Ptosis crutches  There are two main types of Ptosis crutches: Adjustable Eye Crutches: This type of crutch is typically attached to the frame on the nasal side. They are easily adjusted and do not alter the frame as much as other crutches. They have their disadvantages, however: They must be constantly adjusted. This can weaken the metal at the adjustment point, and lead to broken crutches. This crutch is not commonly used and not recommended for moderate to severe cases of the Ptosis condition. Reinforced Eye-Crutches: These crutches are attached to the ends of the crutch, and are not as adjustable. Due to the double attachment, this crutch is resistant to breaking. This crutch also comes with a clear plastic coating finish, which helps with comfort, as well as those with allergy sensitivities. The reinforced eye crutch is the most viable solution for individuals with Ptosis looking for non-surgical options.  Materials used  Crutches are limited to what type of frames they can be placed on. Both metal and plastic frames can be used, but may have limitations. A skilled craftsman can successfully install Ptosis eye crutches to almost any frame. The upper eyewire must be close to the orbit of the eyelid. Frames with large or small B measurements may be difficult to work with for Ptosis crutches. Plastic Frames: Plastic frames must be thick enough for crutches to be attached or embedded into the frame. Too-thin plastic frames will not work for Ptosis crutches. Metal Frames: Metal frames have the highest success rate for eye crutches to be installed. To attach the crutch, it must be soldered onto the eyewire. The metal must be durable. As with anything there may be limitations, but consulting with a skilled specialist can usually confirm all available options. Metal frames are recommended for Ptosis crutches, as they are less likely to break during adjustments.  Pros  Ptosis eye crutches help support an individual's eyelids so they are able to see.  Cons  Ptosis crutches can be uncomfortable if they are not properly fitted. It is always helpful if an optician can take proper measurements to ensure a comfortable fit. The crutch should not fit too tightly, as this can lead to discomfort and an irritable experience. Using an eye crutch usually results in patients being unable to blink completely, which may lead to dry eyes. A doctor may recommend eye drops for those with Ptosis. Sensitivity to metals are a concern as well; it is helpful if eye crutches are made with non-allergenic metals, such as titanium/nickel alloys.Ptosis crutches should be kept clean. Mild soaps, specific eyeglass cleaning solutions and proper coatings may help with maintenance. The lid should be monitored for several days as the crutch can create a moist environment in the lid.

Her works were widely used to expand the newly developed tourism industry of the East Indies. Early life Margarethe Mathilde Weissenborn was born on 22 March 1883 or 1889, to Cornelia Emma Angely Lina da Paula (n√©e Roessner) and Hermann Theodor Weissenborn in either Surabaya, or Kediri, on East Java of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Her parents were German-born, naturalized Dutch citizens and operated a coffee plantation in Kediri. In 1892, her mother returned with Thilly and her siblings to the Netherlands and took up residence in The Hague. They were joined by their father the following year. After five years, the oldest son and the father left for Tanganyika in German East Africa to become planters there. Else, one of Thilly's older sisters, who had studied photography in Paris, opened a photographic studio in The Hague in 1903, where Thilly began working. In 1912, she left the Netherlands and returned to Java, in the company of her brother Theo to join their brother Oscar, who was living in Bandung. Career In 1913, Weissenborn found employment in a prestigious photographic studio in Surabaya which was founded by Onnes Kurkdjian, an Armenian, called Atelier Kurkdjian. The studio was the only agent for Kodak in East Java. Kurkdjian had died by the time Weissenborn arrived and the studio, which employed thirty photographers, was managed by an Englishman, GP Lewis. Weissenborn honed her craft under Lewis' tutelage learning both photographic and retouching techniques. In 1917, she moved to Garut in West Java and managed a photographic studio GAH Lux in the Garoetsche Apotheek en Handelsvereeniging Company, a pharmacy owned by Denis G. Mulder. Mulder moved to Bandung in 1920 and turned over his property to Weissenborn, who changed the firm name to Foto Lux. In 1930, she established Lux Fotograaf Atelier NV, which she operated for a decade in Garut. Weissenborn became the first significant woman photographer in Indonesia and was one of the few photographers working in the era who were Indonesian-born. Her works were marked by a lyrical quality and her attempt to capture the idyllic nature of the landscape. She is most known for her photographs of architectural interiors, landscapes, and portraits, which were produced for the burgeoning tourist industry. Some of her works were featured in Dutch tourism guide published in 1922, as Come to Java. Her photographs also made up the majority of the images in Louis Couperus' work Oostwaarts (Eastward, 1923). Weissenborn traveled throughout the East Indies, and particularly worked in Bali, trying to capture the exotic nature of the islands, while at the same time, retaining the dignity of locals she photographed. Ironically, her images were at times appropriated and used in prurient manners, such as a photograph of two women on a road carrying water, one who has a pot on her head, which was used for a French novel titled L'√éle des seins nus (Island of Bare Breasts). In time, her portrait images changed from partially-clad images to the more artistic images of dancing girls. These were featured in such magazines as Inter-Ocean, Sluyter‚Äôs Monthly and Tropical Netherlands, which marketed a more civilized Bali to international tourists. Later life During World War II, the 16th Army of Japan landed in West Java at the end of February, 1942. After subduing the population, around 30,000 American, Australian, British, Dutch, and Indo- European civilians were transported to civilian internment camps. In 1943, Weissenborn was interned in the Japanese prisoner of war camp Kare√´s in Bandung. Women and children were kept in the camp until 1945. The town of Garut was destroyed by fire and then in the aftermath of the Indonesian National Revolution, Weissenborn's studio was completely destroyed and all of her glass negatives were lost in 1947. That same year, she married Nico Wijnmalen and the couple moved to Bandung. In 1956, the Indonesian government repudiated the remaining terms of the Hague Round Table Conference forcing Weissenborn and Wijnmalen to return to Holland. Weissenborn died 28 October 1964 at Baarn, in Utrecht Province, The Netherlands and is buried in the Baarn New General Cemetery. Legacy Her family donated one of the albums of her work to the permanent collection of the Tropical Museum Collection in Amsterdam and her works have been featured in the National Gallery of Australia. A collection of her works was published in 1983, by her nephew Ernst Drissen called Vastgelegd voor Later. Indische Foto's (1917-1942) van Thilly Weissenborn (Retrospective. East Indian Pictures (1917-1942) of Thilly Weissenborn) in Amsterdam.

Background In 2015, the refugee crisis became front-page news across the world. Affected by images of the plight of refugees in camps across Europe, the grassroots aid movement (otherwise known as the people-to-people, or people solidarity movement) consisting of thousands of private individuals with no prior NGO experience began in earnest to self-organise and form groups taking aid to areas of displaced persons. Calais Action's founder, Libby Freeman, visited Calais in July 2015 with a van of donated items. Upon returning, she founded direct-giving group Calais Action in August 2015. Newspaper coverage and TV interviews inspired a wave of interest from the public. As a result of the press coverage, many people contacted Freeman wanting to help, and so a group of individuals nationwide was created, where aid was collected in local drops and delivered to Calais, Hungary and the Greek Islands. After the publication of photos of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned child refugee on a Turkish beach in August 2015 in news outlets worldwide, public support and sympathy for refugees peaked, and Calais Action's map of UK-wide aid drops was used in the Guardian to direct concerned readers. Following the huge public response, over 8,000 square feet of aid was collected and sent from the Calais Action warehouse in London to Northern France, Hungary, and the Greek Islands. Demolition of Calais Jungle When the Calais Jungle was partially demolished by French authorities in March 2016, it was found that 129 unaccompanied minors in the camp there were unaccounted for. In October 2016, the remaining Jungle camp was demolished and residents dispersed. Volunteers from Calais Action appeared in TV and radio coverage of the event, correcting essential details and misinformation (such as the idea that all inhabitants had been evacuated before the fire) and are part of the documentary \\"Calais Children: A Case to Answer\\" which was shot during demolitions featuring the plight of minors left stranded by the authorities. Campaigning Calais Action campaigns in Parliament to provide more safe and legal routes for refugees, and supported the Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Bill, created by Labour peer Alf Dubs to allow 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees into the UK. The Dubs Amendment was defeated on its first passage through the Commons on 25 April 2016, but a later revision of the Amendment was submitted to the Commons and was passed on 9 May 2016 after both David Cameron and Theresa May conceded in the face of public pressure. However, the Dubs scheme was capped at 480, far short of the 3,000 children that it was intended to benefit. Currently, Calais Action is part of the House of Lords refugee focus group Action for Humanity,http://lordrogerroberts.uk/ the Refugee Task Force INGO group and the Safe Passage campaign group lobbying for safe and legal routes to asylum such as the Kindertransport Legacy Campaign. Volunteers have spoken at the UNHCR and ALNAP humanitarian conferenceshttps://www.alnap.org/system/files/content/resource/files/main/alnap-31-annual- meeting-programme-%5Bdigital%5D.pdf to provide a grassroots perspective to INGOs and aid workers. Calais Action continues to send aid to Europe and raise awareness of refugees and the necessity for safe and legal routes to asylum.

The work was composed in 1908 and was Reinecke's last concerto before his death. It was first performed on March 15, 1909 in Leipzig by the flutist Maximilian Schwedler, to whom the piece is dedicated. Composition The concerto has a duration of roughly 20 minutes and is composed in three movements: #Allegro molto moderato #Lento e mesto #Moderato ‚Äì In tempo animato ‚Äì Tempo I ‚Äì Pi√π mosso ‚Äì Pi√π lento maestoso =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo flute and an orchestra consisting of two additional flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, timpani, percussion, and strings. Reception The Flute Concerto has been compared to other works of the era. Geoffrey Norris of Gramophone called it a \\"substantial work\\" and said it \\"makes amends for the fact that Brahms never wrote a concerto for flute.\\" John Rockwell of The New York Times was somewhat more critical, remarking, \\"Reinecke's sensibility was shaped by another Leipziger, Mendelssohn, and his flute concerto seems blissfully dated for a work composed in this century. It has an undeniable craft, and the final movement especially provides virtuosic moments for the soloist. But it is no masterwork.\\" Michael Dervan of The Irish Times similarly opined, \\"The prolific Carl Reinecke, conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and director of the Leipzig Conservatory, has become a one-work composer, remembered for his Undine Sonata for flute and piano, and, a lot more rarely, for the two concertos recorded here.

The son of Lord Chancellor Finlay, William Finlay was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, before being called to the English bar in 1901. He became a King's counsel in 1914, a High Court judge in 1924, and a Lord Justice of appeal in 1938. Finlay's rapid rise to professional prominence was accompanied by accusations of nepotism, though his competence was not questioned. In 1929, he inherited his father's peerages, becoming the second and last Viscount Finlay. In addition to his legal work, Finlay also played an important role in economic warfare against Germany during both World Wars, and was responsible for two influential, if much criticised, reports on the English legal aid system. After the Second World War, Finlay was involved in the prosecution of German war crimes, serving as the British representative to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, and fought against British official indifference and obstruction. The work took a heavy toll on his health, leading to his premature death in 1945.  Early life and career  Finlay was born on 15 October 1875 in London, the son of the Scottish barrister Robert Finlay and of Mary Finlay, n√©e Innes, daughter of Cosmo Innes. Robert Finlay, later the first Viscount Finlay, later served as Lord Chancellor between 1916 and 1919 in Lloyd George's government. William Finlay was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he placed third division of the third class in Part I of the classical tripos in 1897. He was president of the Cambridge Union in Easter term 1898. Finlay was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1901 and joined the Northern Circuit. In 1905, he was appointed junior counsel to the Board of Inland Revenue by his father, in one of his last official acts as Attorney-General. The choice caused some controversy, given his father's position and his very short standing at the bar. In contrast, his predecessor, Sidney Rowlatt, had fourteen years' seniority at the bar when he was appointed. Criticising the appointment, the Law Times wrote: > Of this gentleman's ability and qualifications for this important and not > unrenumerative post we confess our entire ignorance‚Äîa lack of knowledge that > is shared by the Profession generally. But we do contend that to appoint a > barrister of four years and six months' standing to a position of this > description can only be described as a job. However, there was no criticism of the way in which he carried out the duties of the post, which he occupied until 1914. He was appointed a King's Counsel the same year. During World War I, Finlay served as chairman of the Contraband Committee in 1916, vice-chairman of the Allied Blockade Committee from 1917 to 1919, and was a temporary adviser to the Foreign Office for the Paris Peace Conference. For his wartime service, Finlay was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. He was also appointed to the L√©gion d'honneur and was made an Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. After the war, Finlay returned to the bar, often appearing in front of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. On at least one occasion he appeared in the House of Lords before his father, who was sitting as a judge. He served as Commissioner of Assize for the Northern Circuit in 1921 and for the Midland and Oxford Circuits in 1922. Finlay also served as the British representative on the International Blockade Commission in 1920‚Äì21. He was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple in November 1924.  High Court judge  In 1924, Parliament passed resolutions under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1910 to authorise the appointment of two additional High Court judges to cope with the arrears of cases in the King's Bench Division. Finlay was duly appointed to one of the new positions in December 1924. The appointment again caused some controversy, as his father was still judicially active. The Law Times remarked that: > Sir William Finlay ... must be accounted as a singularly fortunate man ... > after but twenty-three years at the Bar, for no apparent Professional > reason, he is passed over the heads of those who have undoubted prior claims > for consideration and whose appointment would have strengthened the King's > Bench. However, there was subsequently little complaint about the way in which he carried out his judicial duties. On the bench, Finlay tried the revenue list, which he inherited from Mr Justice Rowlatt, and presided over a number of notable criminal trials. In 1925, he tried Norman Thorne for murder. His summing-up speech, which singled out the forensic evidence of Sir Bernard Spilsbury for the prosecution over those of several defence witnesses, proved to be controversial. In 1932, he tried 31 Dartmoor prison rioters over sixteen days, taking three hours to pronounce sentence. In 1935, he tried Reginald Woolmington (of Woolmington v DPP fame) for murder; the jury was unable to come to a verdict, and Woolmington was tried again before Mr Justice Rigby Swift. In 1938, he tried the 17-year-old Owen Meakin for the murder of his father. Norman Birkett convinced the jury to return a verdict of manslaughters by referring to the father's behaviour towards his family, and Finlay sentenced Meakin to a short term of twelve months' imprisonment. In 1925, Finlay was appointed to chair the Committee on Legal Aid for the Poor, charged with examining English legal aid arrangements. The Committee's two reports, on criminal legal aid (1926) and civil legal aid outside of the High Court (1928) concluded that no major reform of the English legal aid system was necessary, a conclusion much criticised later. Memorably, rejecting a submission that a system of \\"legal hospitals\\" should be established, the second report stated that \\"It is manifestly in the interests of the State that its citizens should be healthy, not that they should be litigious.\\"Committee on Legal Aid for the Poor: Final Report (Cmd. 3016). pp. 9‚Äì10. Upon the death of his father in 1929 Finlay succeeded as the second Viscount Finlay. In 1937, he became ex officio Railway and Canal Commissioner for England and chairman of Wiltshire Quarter sessions.  Court of Appeal and Second World War  The Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 19381 & 2 Geo. 6 c. 67 authorised the appointment of three additional Lords Justices of Appeal to create a permanent third division of the Court of Appeal. In October 1938, Finlay was appointed as one of the three new Lords Justices and was sworn of the Privy Council the following month. During the Second World War, he was seconded from the Court of Appeal to chair the Contraband Committee of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, an appointment which reflected his work during the First World War. In 1943, Lord Selborne, the Minister of Economic Warfare, commissioner Finlay to produce a report on the future of the ministry; Finlay recommend that it should be disbanded after the end of the war in Europe, but that provision should be made elsewhere within the government for economic warfare planning and economic intelligence. Finlay was promoted a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1945 New Year honours list. The same year, he was chosen as the British representative to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, in succession to Sir Cecil Hurst, whose health had broken down and who was frustrated at the British government's failure to respond to the Commission's proposals for the prosecution of war criminals. The relationship between the Commission and the British government were at a low point: there was a general feeling that the British were uninterested in the Commission's work, and the Norwegian government had withdrawn from the Commission out of frustration. Finlay was proposed as a candidate by Sir William Malkin, the Foreign Office Legal Adviser, who wanted to appoint a prominent figure to show that the British government attached importance to the Commission's work. Finlay was also appointed chairman of a British war crimes inter-departmental committee. It was pointed out in Whitehall that Finlay \\"would be personally responsible for making the British machine work and could not therefore possibly accuse the Foreign Office or HMG generally for unnecessary delays, following the example of Sir Cecil Hurst.\\"Kochavi, Prelude to Nuremberg, p. 129 Finlay was met with obstruction from certain parts of the government. For instance, a proposal to have German prisoners of war interrogated at the London Cage on war crimes was vetoed by Patrick Dean at the Foreign Office on the grounds that to ask them anything more than their name, rank, and number would breach the Geneva Conventions. Finlay also complained that the British Army was so disorganised that it had allowed important evidence of war crimes to be lost. Finlay's health was affected by a trip to Buchenwald concentration camp with the UN War Crimes Commission in April 1945. He continued to work after his return, but \\"admitted to friends that he never really felt well again\\". He died on 30 June 1945, in a nursing home in Redhill, Surrey, whereupon his peerages became extinct. He had been widely expected to be the British choice for appointment to the new International Court of Justice.  Character and assessment  Writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, G. R. Rubin described Finlay as \\"competent but not outstanding\\" both at the bar and on the bench, although he praised Finlay for his courage and zeal in his drive to make governments pursue German war criminals in the face of official obstruction and disinterest. Finlay's judicial demeanour was described as dignified and courteous, if slightly pompous. In private he was said to be jovial and an engaging host. Finlay shared his father's interest in literature, and was described by The Times as \\"like his father...a scholar, with a vein of old- world culture\\". As reader of the Middle Temple in 1933 he delivered a noted reading on \\"Law and Literature\\".  Family  In 1903, Finlay married Beatrice Marion Hall (1880‚Äì1942), daughter of Edward Kirkpatrick Hall. They had one daughter, the Hon Rosalind Mary Finlay (1914‚Äì2002), who married Vice-Admiral Sir John Hayes in 1939.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on December 21, 2012. It focuses on a call received by an employee of a customer service call centre; the player must navigate through the call without irritating the caller or breaking confidentiality laws. Gallant was fired from his job at a call centre as a direct result of publishing the game.  Background and development  Gallant had some experience with the process of flash game development, having developed various short games in his spare time. He began developing these games around 2011, and regularly attended meetups in his home town of Toronto. Gallant developed I Get This Call Every Day during his part-time employment as a call centre employee at the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in Toronto, Ontario. While attending TOJam, a game jam, in 2013, Gallant got into a conversation about non-games, from which the concept was born. The art for the game was created entirely with open-source graphics program GIMP, and the majority of the script was written during his commutes to and from work. The two primary characters in the game, who share 250 lines of dialogue, are both voiced by Gallant. The game was developed in the open-source software package Flixel.  Gameplay  I Get This Call Every Day makes use of a simplistic art style and uses only one viewpoint throughout the game In I Get This Call Every Day, players take the role of an unnamed call centre employee sitting at their desk. They answer a call from \\"Billy Swarth\\", a taxpayer who wants to change his address in the system. The caller is snippy and dense, and will answer security questions only partially. The player can select from a menu of responses to guide Swarth through the security process. The game features one route in which the player manages to keep their job. In all other routes the player will be fired, either by breaching client confidentiality by allowing Swarth's half-answers through, or by annoying Swarth enough to have him ask for their manager. An average play through of the game lasts a few minutes.  Release and reception  I Get This Call Every Day was self-released on Gallant's personal website on December 21, 2012, as a pay what you want title with a $2 minimum. He sent emails to various gaming websites and blogs for publicity, some of which were successful. Gallant worked to get the game through Steam's \\"greenlight\\" process, but withdrew the game in May 2013. In a blog post written for Gamasutra, he said this was partially in protest at Paranautical Activity's high-profile rejection by Valve, but also because of the \\"negativity\\" he felt during the process. However, he later decided to relist the game in the system, and it was eventually approved on April 7, 2014. Critics praised the concept, but noted the game was not designed to be \\"fun\\". Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez wrote that \\"It embodies the type of shift that I'd like the game industry at large to see... I'd rather play a game like this‚Äîadmittedly not fun, and even kind of ugly-looking‚Äîthan play most triple-A games out there.\\" A Polygon feature in March 2014 estimated the Gallant had earned around $10,000 from sales of the game since its release. = Firing from the CRA = Shortly after the game's release, it picked up press traction in Gallant's hometown of Toronto. A January 29, 2013 front-page feature in the Toronto Star explicitly made the link between Gallant's part-time job with the CRA and the narrative of the game, which has no obvious ties to any government agency. The CRA's communications director, Clarke Olsen, told the Star that National Revenue Minister, Gail Shea, \\"considers this type of conduct offensive and completely unacceptable\\". Gallant was fired from this role at the CRA following the Star's story. Jim McGinley, organizer of TOJam, kept a blog of Gallant's treatment following the publication of I Get This Call Every Day, arguing he was punished for his choice of medium: \\"If David had written a short story, directed a movie, or did some stand-up inspired by his boring job he'd still be employed. In fact, he'd be celebrated.\\" Speaking to Polygon, he argued that Shea's outrage indicated she had not personally experienced the game, and Mathew Kumar of Torontoist wrote that \\"Playing the game itself makes it clear that it was no attempt to get fired\\". Following press around Gallant's firing, sales of the game increased. Popular Let's Play channels on YouTube, such as The Yogscast, released videos based on the game.

Warshaw currently curates the online Encyclopedia of Surfing and History of Surfing, each website based on expanded material from the archives assembled for their print companions. Background Born in Los Angeles and raised in Venice Beach and Manhattan Beach, at his competitive peak Warshaw was the second- ranked amateur in California and 43rd-ranked professional on the International Professional Surfers world tour (1982). After working as a student at several Southern California community colleges and San Diego State University while still a competitive surfer, Warshaw earned a B.A. in History from the University of California, Berkeley (1992). After finishing his degree at Berkeley, Warshaw briefly aspired to a career in academia, enrolling in the graduate program in History at UCLA. He quit after three weeks. Warshaw is noted for saying \\"All I knew when I quit [graduate school at UCLA] was that I was going to make a living writing about surfing, and as a matter of vanity, I wanted to be the world's authority on it.\\" Today he is widely recognized as one of the world's foremost historians of surfing, living up to a 2005 feature on his work that named him \\"the caretaker of surfing history.\\" 1969 marks the year that Warshaw began surfing in Southern California along with friend and future skateboarding icon Jay Adams. Three years later in 1972, a twelve-year- old Warshaw accidentally became the owner of the very first surfboard made under Jeff Ho's Zephyr Productions brand. As Warshaw recounts, he had been surfing a custom Jeff Ho swallowtail for about six months before the board was stolen from the car park at Leo Carrillo State Beach. Devastated, the young surfer scraped together money from odd jobs to order another board from Ho a few months later. When he received the new board from shop manager Skip Engblom, Warshaw noticed that the shaper's name had been replaced with a single airbrushed word, Zephyr. Sensing Warshaw's surprise, Engblom explained that Zephyr was a new label launched by Ho's shop. Warshaw had unintentionally become the owner of the very first Zephyr artifact of any kind, well before Ho's new surfboard label and its homonymous skateboarding brand had gained fame through the Zephyr Competition Team, or Z-Boys. Warshaw was later one of the first Zephyr surf team riders. As a Z-Boy, Warshaw outgrew his pre-teen moniker, \\"Wimpy,\\" although his clean-cut image stood in striking contrast to the rebel personalities (Jay Adams, Tony Alva, etc.) that would accompany the Zephyr skateboard brand in later years.  Career  Warshaw began writing for surf-related publications in Southern California in the 1980s. After becoming a writer for Surfer magazine in 1984, Warshaw became the publication's editor in 1990. Shortly thereafter, he left the monthly magazine, a decision which he described as \\"[doing] them a big favor by leaving; they just didn't know it at the time,\\" citing his dislike of crunching numbers for advertising revenue. His subsequent relocation to San Francisco was partially motivated by the overcrowding of surfing beaches in Southern California and a desire for a change of scenery in the wake of surfing's evolution into a popular pastime devoid of community ties. He lived, surfed, and wrote in San Francisco for over two decades. His work has since appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, Esquire, Outside, and The Surfer's Journal, among others. He is regularly consulted for online content for prominent surfing media outlets, including Beach Grit, Surfer, Surfline, and STAB. Among other titles, Warshaw authored The History of Surfing (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2010) and The Encyclopedia of Surfing (Orlando: Harcourt, 2003. 2nd ed. 2005). The latter book has since been converted into a regularly-updated website featuring many of the print book's original entries, a blog, archival video and audio content, and feature content by notable surf personalities. Described as the \\"synthesis of a museum, an archive, and even a theater\\" at its launch, Warshaw describes the online portal as \\"a conservation project. [...] a digital place where the sport can be presented, stored, celebrated, archived, and accessed.\\" Originally planned to be a feature for Surfline.com, the Encyclopedia of Surfing was sponsored by Surfer magazine. However, Surfer magazine dropped its sponsorship. In 2017, rather than shut the site down, Warshaw started a fundraiser to support the Encyclopedia of Surfing. He successfully raised the funds necessary to keep Encyclopedia of Surfing running. His 2003 work, Mavericks: The Story of Big-Wave Surfing, sold over 35,000 copies and was released in a second edition in 2005. Notable for his archival scholarly rigor and \\"brazenly incisive prose,\\" Warshaw has long been noted by fellow surf journalists and writers as a foremost popular historical authority on the subject of surfing. Longtime The New Yorker staff writer and 2016 Pulitzer prize winner in the ¬´Biography and Memoir¬ª category William Finnegan wrote the foreword to the 2005 print edition of The Encyclopedia of Surfing. Chapter Eight of Finnegan's Pulitzer-winning Barbarian Days discusses a specific stretch of Northern California beach that he and Warshaw both frequented at different points in their lives, before the area was hopelessly crowded. Journalists such as STAB magazine co-founder Derek Rielly regularly praises Warshaw in print. Warshaw has mentored numerous young journalists, placing writers on the Surfer editorial staff and connecting independent authors with editors and surfing personalities for their investigative work. He is known for his generosity with information and willingness to share research material with university researchers and academics and his work is regularly cited and acknowledged by international scholars publishing about surfing. Also a bibliophile and collector, Warshaw is reputed to hold one of the largest private archives of surf-related publications, media, and memorabilia in the world. In spite of his renown, Warshaw has publicly and humorously decried the difficulty of earning a living through writing about surfing. He once remarked, \\"I've written strictly about surfing because I feel the most secure when I know that I've got the most information available on a subject. That's what allows me to write with confidence. I don't call it important, but I do realize that I'm doing it, and nobody else is, and that's gratifying. I invented a nice, low-paying career for myself (laughter).\\"  The EOS goes OED  In early 2016, Warshaw was contacted by Joshua Pendragon, a Manchester, UK-based Oxford English Dictionary Library Researcher and consultant, to help verify the first uses for the terms \\"longboard\\" and \\"longboarder.\\" After finding Drew Kampion's use of the term \\"long board\\" in a September 1968 (vol. 9, no. 4) SURFER article (\\"The Super Short, Uptight, V-Bottom, Tube Carving Plastic Machines, and other assorted short subjects\\"), Warshaw was enlisted to document the first uses for entries including \\"tandem surfing\\" and \\"tandem surfboard.\\" He quickly located \\"tandem surfing\\" in Tom Blake's Hawaiian Surfriders, 1935 and was invited to become an external consultant to the OED editors. Later that year, Senior Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, David Martin, contacted Warshaw about providing additional source citations for the earliest published usage of a large body of surfing terms, including \\"barrel,\\" \\"reef rash,\\" \\"board sock,\\" \\"grom,\\" \\"close out,\\" \\"dawn patrol,\\" \\"doggy door,\\" \\"green room,\\" \\"shaper,\\" and \\"swallowtail.\\" As a formal consultant to the OED, Warshaw continues to contribute to the authority's surf lexicon with quotation evidence for numerous surf-specific terms. Referencing his family's academic pedigree, Warshaw said his consultancy for the OED is his accomplishment that has \\"most impressed his parents.\\"  Bibliography (select)  * Surfriders: In Search of the Perfect Wave Warshaw (ed.)

Leonard Duhl of UC Berkeley is seated at the upper left, Michael Marien of the World Future Society is seated with legs crossed at the upper right, and spiritual-politics theorist and activist Corinne McLaughlin is sitting to Marien's right. The New World Alliance was an American political organization that sought to articulate and implement what it called \\"transformational\\" political ideas. It was organized in the late 1970s and dissolved in 1983. It has been described as the first U.S. national political organization of its type and as the first entity to articulate a comprehensive transformational political program. The Alliance maintained a national office two blocks from the White House. It established chapters across the U.S., produced a 98-page political platform, conducted \\"Political Awareness Seminars\\" to help participants learn to communicate across ideological and psychological divides, initiated national \\"Consultations with Elected Officials,\\" and produced a national political newsletter whose sponsors included Ecotopia author Ernest Callenbach and psychologist Carl Rogers. Over the decades, social scientists and others have sought to explain why the Alliance did not achieve a longer life. There is no agreement. Explanations have touched on history (the U.S. was not ready), culture (the Alliance was too counter-cultural), process (the commitment to near-unanimous consensus decision-making was too onerous), leadership (the people on the Governing Council did not have the personalities or skills to build a mass organization), transformational political assumptions and behaviors (said to be inappropriate, self-defeating, or cult-like), and more. Following the dissolution of the organization, many former Governing Council members and other founders of the Alliance ‚Äì many near the beginning of their careers ‚Äì took transformational ideas into a variety of organizational settings, including the early U.S. Green Party movement and the multinational corporate world. Their organizational efforts and published political writings extended into the 21st century.

Citing the ancient Greek concept of Paideia, Alliance chair Bob Olson told an interviewer that the Alliance wanted to build a society where every institution was geared to developing people's abilities and potentials. Political theorists Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson identified what they felt was a defining passage in one Alliance document: > Politics is the way we live our lives. It is not just running for office. It > is the way we treat each other, as individuals, as groups, as government. It > is the way we treat our environment. It is the way we treat > ourselves.McLaughlin, Spiritual, p. 70 (quoting a New World Alliance > document). Arthur Stein, a political scientist at University of Rhode Island, pointed to another passage in an Alliance document: > The NWA seeks to break away from the old quarrels of \\"left against right\\" > and help create a new consensus based on our heartfelt needs. It emphasizes > personal growth ‚Äì and nurturing others ‚Äì rather than indiscriminate material > growth. It advocates \\"human scale\\" institutions that function with human > consideration and social responsibilities.

We call this synthesis \\"New World\\" politics.Stein, Seeds, p. > 135 (quoting a New World Alliance document). Author Kirkpatrick Sale observed that the Alliance's newsletter boiled its definition of transformational politics down to a phrase ‚Äì \\"the reconceptualization of politics along human growth, decentralist, and world order lines.\\"Kirkpatrick Sale, \\"Kirkpatrick Sale's Letter from America,\\" Resurgence magazine, vol. 89, November‚ÄìDecember 1981, p. 6. \\"As sorry a mouthful of rhetoric as that is,\\" Sale concluded, \\"that's roughly what this 'transformational' idea is all about.\\"  History  = The organizing tour = Mark Satin at the start on his 24-city organizing tour for the Alliance, Vancouver, Canada, 1978. (Photo by Erich Hoyt.) Organizing for the Alliance began in 1978, when author Mark Satin embarked on a two-year tour of North America. Although the tour was initially designed to promote one of his books at conferences and other events, it quickly expanded into an effort to locate those who wanted to start a new political organization with a new political perspective. Satin told the authors of the book Networking that he traveled \\"systematically\\" to 24 cities and regions across the continent. He was especially interested in finding people committed enough to want to fill out an extensive questionnaire about the future organization. According to one magazine, by the summer of 1979 Satin had traveled over 50,000 miles, mostly by Greyhound bus. He stopped when he found 500 people that were willing to answer the questionnaire. = The questionnaire = The questionnaire, when finally composed and sent out, came to 21 pages. One political science text later compared it to a Delphi survey. It consisted largely of multiple-choice questionsBelden Paulson, Odyssey of a Practical Visionary, Thistlefield Books, 2009, pp. 500‚Äì03. . The author is identified as a political scientist at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. about what a transformation-oriented political organization should consist of. Some questions dealt with policy; for example, \\"How can we make small family farming more of an option for Americans?\\" Others dealt with structure ‚Äì \\"How large should the Board of Directors be?\\" Of the 500 people the questionnaire was sent to, 350 responded. The author of the book Green Parties described the respondents as people involved in personal-growth work and social change. The editors of a book on transformational politics described them as \\"academics, policy experts, and political activists interested in this emerging political perspective.\\" While it is not clear how closely the organization followed the questionnaire in shaping itself, one political scientist thought it significant that the \\"overwhelming source\\" of U.S. political problems among questionnaire-answerers was found to be \\"our attitudes and values.\\" = \\"Governing Council\\" = GC chairperson Bob Olson (second from right) was a project director at the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment. GC member Kirkpatrick Sale (center) was a Neo-Luddite theorist.Steven Jones, Against Technology: From the Luddites to Neo-Luddism, Routledge, 2006, pp. 23‚Äì24. . The questionnaire determined that a 39-member board of directors, called the Governing Council (GC), should be chosen to run the Alliance. In addition, it determined that the GC should be chosen from among the questionnaire-answerers themselves. Eighty-nine of them volunteered to stand for the GC, and the first 39 GCers were chosen by a variety of means: 40% by mail ballot, 30% by lottery, 20% by Satin (who'd met the questionnaire-answerers during his bus tour), and 10% by four women. The selection process produced a diverse GC. A political scientist pointed to \\"teachers, feminists, think-tank members.\\" A journalist called attention to a Ronald Reagan speechwriter, a former Robert F.

Booklet, no ISBN assigned. Besides being on the GC, Olson served as chairperson of the Alliance. = Structure and process = The Alliance's national office was two blocks from the White House, in the light brown building midway down the row of buildings here. The Governing Council met semi-annually.Marilyn Ferguson, \\"Foreword,\\" in Mark Satin, New Options for America: The Second American Experiment Has Begun, The Press at California State University, Fresno, 1991, p. xiii. . There was also a Coordinating Committee, and a national office was established two blocks from the White House in Washington, D.C. But one of the Alliance's expressed goals was \\"a politics of participation,\\" and the GC chose not to run the Alliance from the top down. The authors of the book Networking describe the organization as \\"nonhierarchically structured\\" and say decisions were made by decentralized committees. There were also local chapters. Belden Paulson, a political scientist at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, says that in the early years the Alliance had \\"a kind of missionary zeal\\" to establish local chapters across the U.S. He reports that 50 people turned up at the initial chapter meeting in Milwaukee and that the group met for several years. The Alliance's processes emphasized consensus and even meditation. An encyclopedia from Gale Research reports that the Alliance expressed a \\"commitment to consensus building in all our groups and projects.\\"Melton et al., Encyclopedia, p. 324 (quoting the Alliance's newsletter). It also reports that Alliance chapters and projects claimed to use \\"short periods of silence [in order] to draw on our intuition in making decisions and solving conflicts.\\" = Projects = The Alliance sustained four principal projects.  Political platform  The Alliance produced a 98-page political platform that achieved what one commentator claimed was wide circulation. A Transformation Platform: The Dialogue Begins discussed crime and justice, economics, science and technology, health, the environment, global affairs, and more. It made about 300 specific policy proposals. But it sought to do more than provide good ideas. Bob Olson, chair of the Alliance, tried to explain to the Association for Humanistic Psychology why he felt the platform was unique: > ... we call [it] a Living Platform. The platform offers concrete political > proposals, but doesn't purport to offer final answers. It includes > commentary and dissenting opinion, and it asks readers to criticize it and > help improve it, so that over the years ahead it can serve as a focus for > thousands of people to cooperate in thinking through the changes we need to > make.Olson, \\"The New,\\" p. 15.  \\"Political Awareness Seminars\\"  These were day-long or weekend experiences designed to make participants more deeply aware of the political process and their own potential for using it to heal society. To some observers, the seminars functioned primarily to build self-confidence. To Olson, they helped participants discover and merge their visions of a better society, and explore how to implement them. To the authors of Spiritual Politics, the key part came when participants were asked to act out their feelings toward their political adversaries ‚Äì and were then told to reverse roles. \\"Many deep insights resulted,\\" the authors wrote, \\"with participants discovering [they] often had problems similar to the ones they accused their adversaries of having.\\"McLaughlin, Spiritual, p. 109.  \\"Consultations with Elected Officials\\"  California legislator John Vasconcellos invited people to the Alliance's first \\"Consultation with Elected Officials\\" and was a featured speaker there. These were national conferences of \\"transformation- oriented\\" politicians, Alliance GC members, and other interested parties. Political science professor Belden Paulson, who helped coordinate the first one, in Milwaukee, says he recruited California state legislator John Vasconcellos and Colorado state legislator Miller Hudson to invite people to the weekend event and be speakers there. Sixteen elected officials ended up attending. There were also eight Alliance GC members, six academics, spiritual writer David Spangler, and some residents of intentional communities. According to a letter Paulson quotes from one of the intentional-community residents, there was great tension at the consultation between pragmatists and visionaries ‚Äì until the last day, when \\"it all came together, starting with the politicians who, one by one, spoke of how this opened whole new horizons for them.\\"Paulson, Odyssey, p. 502 (quoting letter).  National political newsletter  Renewal newsletter attempted to report on current affairs from a transformational perspective. It also attempted to critically assess relevant groups and books and serve as a forum for activists. It boasted nine founding sponsors ‚Äì Ernest Callenbach, Willis Harman, Hazel Henderson, Karl Hess, Patricia Mische (co-author of Toward a Human World OrderGerald Mische and Patricia Mische, Toward a Human World Order: Beyond the National Security Straitjacket, Paulist Press, 1977. .), Jeremy Rifkin, James Robertson, Carl Rogers, and John Vasconcellos. The newsletter's annual \\"Transformational Book Award\\" was voted upon by 70 hand-picked academics and think tank staffers from across the U.S. = Restructuring and dissolution = The Alliance restructured itself in 1982. It decided to close its Washington, D.C. office but keep the Governing Council intact. Rather than running and funding projects and supporting an organizational infrastructure, it would seek to serve as a kind of umbrella for entrepreneurial, independently run projects. It dissolved the next year.Mark Satin, \\"Miraculous Birth of the 'Ten Key Values' Statement,\\" Green Horizon magazine, vol. 9, issue no. 26, Fall‚ÄìWinter 2012, p. 19\\\\. A publication co-edited by John Rensenbrink, co-founder of the U.S. Green Party. Retrieved April 26, 2016.  Assessments  Prominent writer and activist Jeremy Rifkin was a founding sponsor of the Alliance's political newsletter. The Alliance raised many hopes in transformational circles. For example, New Realities, a glossy transformation-oriented magazine, devoted a 3,000-word article to the organizing effort, and futurist Hazel Henderson pointed her readers beyond the U.S. Citizens Party to the \\"more visionary\\" movement incorporating as the New World Alliance.Hazel Henderson, The Politics of the Solar Age: Alternatives to Economics, Anchor Press / Doubleday, 1981, p. 19\\\\. . Arthur Stein noted that each of the founding sponsors of the Alliance's political newsletter had distinguished themselves in their fields. To some observers, including some inside the organization, the Alliance fell short of its promise and potential. It was certainly \\"short-lived,\\" as three political scientists put it. To other observers, the Alliance was a valuable pioneer. = External critics = Some critics focused on history and culture. To political scientist Belden Paulson, the Alliance fell short partly because it was too far ahead of its cultural moment. To Annie Gottlieb, author of a book about the mainstreaming of Sixties-generation attitudes and values, the Alliance fell short because it did not sufficiently root itself in the mainstream culture, and in the immediately practical and viable.Gottlieb, Do You Believe, pp. 153‚Äì54. Other explanations focused on the Alliance's processes. Scholar J. Gordon Melton's encyclopedia said the focus on consensus led to \\"extended meetings and minimal results\\" ‚Äì which in turn led to dispirited participants. Even Aquarian Conspiracy author Marilyn Ferguson commented that the GC meetings, full of \\"intoxicating rhetoric\\" but little else, took their toll on one GC member. Still other explanations focused on internal dysfunction. Belden Paulson noted ongoing \\"friction and personality struggles.\\" He also found it incomprehensible that the Alliance always seemed to be without money. He finally concluded that the GCers with the most power were more interested in advancing their own organizations. Some critics were skeptical about, or hostile to, the Alliance's transformational ideology. Speaking on a panel with two Alliance GC members at an Association for Humanistic Psychology conference in 1982, political scientist Walter Truett Anderson rejected the concept of transformation. He argued that it had become a clich√© and that society was not going to transform itself totally or quickly. He added that its advocates were on the verge of becoming \\"what I think can rightfully be called a cult.\\"Stein, Seeds, p. 137 (quoting Anderson). The Alliance generated opposition among conservative Christians who worried that New Age ideas were being spread under the banner of transformational politics. For example, in her book The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, attorney Constance Cumbey warned that New Age ideas were being \\"synergistically enhanced by the parallel operation of networking organizations such as New World Alliance.\\"Constance E. Cumbey, The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and Our Coming Age of Barbarism, Huntington House, Inc., 1983, pp. 64‚Äì65. . In an anthology called The New Age Rage, religious philosopher Douglas Groothuis said transformational initiatives like the Alliance were slipping New Age ideas into U.S. Democratic Party politics.Douglas Groothuis, \\"Politics: Building an International Platform,\\" in Karen Hoyt and the Spiritual Counterfeits Project, eds., The New Age Rage, Fleming H. Revell Company / Baker Publishing Group, 1987, pp. 97‚Äì98. . = Internal critics = Both before and after the Alliance dissolved, GC members publicly criticized the Alliance. In 1987, former GC member Marc Sarkady told an interviewer that the Alliance was too immersed in the counter- culture. In 1983, writing in a feminist quarterly, GCer Berhe Hagens said that ‚Äì despite all the high-minded rhetoric and processes ‚Äì the male GCers had been dismissive of the female GCers.Bethe Hagens, \\" The Goddess in the New World Alliance,\\" The Creative Woman Quarterly, vol. 6, no. 4, Fall 1983, p. 19. A publication of Governors State University. The author is identified as an anthropologist. Retrieved August 7, 2016. In 1982, Mark Satin complained to an audience of 400 that the Alliance could not decide on its mission.Stein, Seeds, pp. 136-37 (quoting Satin). Later that decade Satin referred to his former colleagues as \\"beautiful losers,\\" and even in the 2000s he was writing about what he saw as the Alliance's \\"ineptness\\" and its failure to understand and seize the moment. A more systemic critique by a GC member was Michael Marien's essay \\"The Transformation as Sandbox Syndrome,\\" published in the Journal of Humanistic Psychology in 1983.Marien, \\"The Transformation,\\" cited above. While Marien aimed his critique at transformational political organizations (and activists) in general, the introduction discusses Marien's involvement in just one such organization ‚Äì the Alliance. His targets in the essay include mistaking lofty goals for political significance, loving- kindness for effective action, and good intentions for actual results.Marien, \\"The Transformation,\\" pp. 7‚Äì10. Toward the end of its existence, Alliance chair Bob Olson wrote ‚Äì in a spirit of acceptance rather than blame ‚Äì that the GC did not have the \\"personalities and skills\\" to create the kind of dynamic mass-membership organization that had originally been envisioned.Melton, Encyclopedia, p. 324 (quoting Olson). = Positive views = Many observers have acknowledged the Alliance for what they see as pioneering contributions to the social change movement. For example, the director of Self Determination, a California-wide transformational political organization co- founded by John Vasconcellos,Ferguson, Aquarian, pp. 232‚Äì35. described the Alliance as \\"the first\\" national political organization of its kind. Political scientist Arthur Stein claimed it made \\"the first attempt to take ecological, decentralist, globalist, and human-growth ideas and translate them into a detailed, practical political platform.\\" A pair of futurists credited the Alliance with attempting to create a national political movement based on new values. A pair of political theorists said the Alliance was one of the first groups attempting to create \\"a new synthesis\\" of left-wing and right-wing political ideas.McLaughlin, Spiritual, p. 72‚Äì73. In a textbook, three political scientists identified the Alliance as a \\"precursor\\" of North American Greens.  Aftermath  Alliance co-founder Gordon Feller later became \\"urban innovations\\" director at Cisco Systems in Silicon Valley. Many initial Governing Council members and other founders of the Alliance ‚Äì often at the early stages of their careers ‚Äì engaged in transformation-oriented activities after the Alliance dissolved in 1983. Some of them contributed to transformational theory and practice for many decades. In 1984, at least nine people associated with the Alliance were among the 62 people in attendance at the invitation-only founding meeting of the U.S. Green Party movement in St. Paul, Minnesota. In addition, the Alliance's platform circulated there.Howard Hawkins, \\" North American Greens Come of Age: Statism vs. Municipalism.\\" Our Generation, vol. 23, no. 1, Winter 1992, p 74. Retrieved August 7, 2016. One former GCer, Mark Satin, was later credited with helping to initiate that meeting,John Ely, \\"Green Politics in the United States and Europe,\\" in Margit Mayer and John Ely, eds., The German Greens: Paradox Between Movement and Party, Temple University Press, 1998, p. 200\\\\. . and in a scholarly book on the early U.S. Greens, ecofeminist author Greta Gaard concluded that Satin \\"played a significant role in facilitating the articulation of Green political thought,\\" and that his political philosophy influenced the Greens' \\"ideological foundation.\\"Greta Gaard, Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens, Temple University Press, 1998, pp. 142‚Äì43. . Other former Alliance members helped organize other transformation-oriented political initiatives. For example, GC members Corinne McLaughlin and Stephen Woolpert helped develop the Ecological and Transformational Politics Section (section #26) of the American Political Science Association, Leonard Duhl helped initiate the Healthy Cities program at the World Health Organization,Howard Frumkin et al., \\"Introduction,\\" in Andrew L.

Located along the Des Moines River in Van Buren County, it was dedicated in 1921. It is the largest state park in size in Iowa. In 1990 three areas were named nationally recognized historic districts and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History A group of local citizens contributed $64,000 to buy the land, which had been a large farm. with The state acquired the land in 1920, and dedicated it as Big Bend Park the following year. In 1923 the park had , it grew to by 1935, and in 1942. The park currently has , making it the largest state park in Iowa. It was renamed in 1926 in honor of John Fletcher Lacey, an American Civil War veteran who went on to serve in both the Iowa House of Representatives and the United States House of Representatives, representing Iowa's 6th congressional district. He was noted for conservation legislation while in Congress and was instrumental in establishing the state park system in Iowa. By 1933 a lodge and a golf course, no longer extant, had been developed in the northwest part of the park. Several government agencies worked at Lacey-Keosauqua to develop the park in the 1930s and the 1940s. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Company 770 arrived in the park on May 28, 1933. They worked with the National Forest Service landscaping and with soil erosion control along the steep river bluffs until October 11 of the same year, when it was transferred to the National Park Service. They continued their work in the park until October 23, 1934. Company 770's primary responsibility was the construction of the earthen dam and concrete spillway to create the man-made lake. CCC Company 2719 began work on August 20, 1934, and stayed until October 1935. Most of the trails were completed in 1934. The National Forest Service and both companies of the CCC built the various buildings. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) worked in the park building the foot and vehicle bridges and other small projects from December 1935 to April 1936. A National Park Service Camp began working in the park in June 1936 and remained until April 1937 or possibly into early 1938. The state of Iowa built two of the six existing cabins between 1940 and 1942 and completed the others sometime after 1942. On November 15, 1990 three areas of the park were listed as historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places. At the time of its nomination it contained 37 contributing properties. Area A contains an entryway, a lodge and picnic area, Area B includes another picnic area and custodial facilities, and Area C contains the bathhouse and other features along the lake. All of the historic structures in the park were designed in the rustic style by the Central Design Office in Ames. The park was part of a larger study of Iowa's state parks called the . =Lodge and Picnic Area (Area A)= Area A is located in the northwest corner of the park. Its historic buildings and structures include the gatehouse and portals, a regulatory sign, lodge, pump house, and picnic shelter. Two rubble limestone portals flank the entrance road. The south portal is nearly square and is tall. The north portal is T-shaped and stands tall. The sign stands in front of the north portal. The rectangular, random rubble limestone gatehouse is separate from the portals and is located to the south of them. The lodge is a two-story, L-shaped building that is located on the main road just beyond the portals. The main section of the structure is covered with weatherboard, and an addition is covered with uncoursed rubble. A wrap-around porch composed of stone walls covers the east side of the building and parts of the adjoining north and south facades. The underground pump house lies to the east of the lodge and is marked by its double-wooden doors. The picnic shelter is one-quarter of a mile to the southeast of the pump house. The shelter is composed of uncoursed ashlar limestone, and it is built into the side of a hill. Restrooms are located in the enclosed rear portion of the structure, and the north side is open. =Picnic and Custodial Group (Area B)= Area B is located in the north central part of the park. Its historic buildings and structures include the custodian's residence, a picnic shelter, a water fountain, two latrines, and several retaining walls at the entrance of the picnic shelter. Located in a clearing off the park road, the custodian's residence is a single-story, rectangular structure composed of rough-faced, coursed ashlar limestone. The gable ends are closed with weatherboard. It is built over a limestone basement. The picnic area is located to the northeast of the custodian's residence. Coursed ashlar limestone encloses the rear of the shelter, and includes a fireplace. Two latrines, of coursed rubble limestone and similar in construction, flank the shelter. The water fountain is located southwest of the shelter. The entrance to the picnic area is marked by four square cement posts that are flanked by two coursed ashlar stone walls. Two long stone walls are located in the center of the grass parking lot. with =Bathing Area (Area C)= Area C is located to the south of Area B near the center of the park. It is the bathing area and it includes the lake, dam, spillway, trail surrounding the lake, the check dams and footbridge along this trail, bathhouse, beach, and pump house. Two bridges in this historic district are considered non-contributing to the historical nature of the district. The lake is fed by a spring that is damned at the north end of the lake. The earthen dam with a concrete core is in length. with Rock riprapping protects its south side from erosion. A concrete spillway curves to the west. A arched, steel bridge (non-contributing) spans across the spillway. Most of the lake is surrounded by a trail. Ten check dams that prevent soil erosion into the lake are located along the trail. They are composed of random rubble and concrete walls. Two coursed rubble limestone footbridges are located south of the lake. One of the two bridges is a WPA structure, and is non-contributing. The bathhouse is located near the top of a hill on the west side of the lake. The single-story uncoursed ashlar limestone building was built on concrete footings. It features a central gable with a cupola and two flanking wings. Concrete steps with random rubble side walls lead down to the beach on the lake. An uncoursed ashlar limestone pump house is built into the hillside. It has a flat roof that is also composed of limestone. Land use Nineteen burial mounds from the ancient Woodland Period are located in the northwest corner of the park. Park visitors are granted access to them. The lake in the center of the park is used for swimming, boating, and fishing. Fishing is also permitted on the Des Moines River. The park also features trails along the lake, and along the river bluffs and valleys for hiking. There are cabins and campsites for campers. Facilities are also available for picnicking. Part of Shimek State Forest is adjacent to the park.

Modern historians distinguish three main Partitions of Mecklenburg:  First partition of Mecklenburg  Mecklenburg after the first partition Depiction by Nicolaus Marschalk in the Chronicon der mecklenburgischen RegentenChronicon der mecklenburgischen Regenten on Wikisource (Chronicon of the Mecklenbugian Regents) around 1520 The first partition of Mecklenburg was carried out in 1234 by the heirs of Henry Borwin II, Lord of Mecklenburg. It was a result of the ' (partition due to partible inheritance) of the territory into four ' (lordships) or ' (principalities): Mecklenburg, Parchim (later Parchim- Richenberg), Werle and Rostock. *John received the Lordship of Mecklenburg: Mecklenburg Castle, Dassow, Kl√ºtz, Bresen (Grevesm√ºhlen), Gadebusch, Poel, Ilow, Bug (Bukow), Br√ºel and Kussin (Neukloster) *Pribislaw received the Lordship of Parchim: Parchim, Sternberg, Brenz (Neustadt), Ture (L√ºbz) and Quetzin (Plau-Goldberg) *Nicholas received the Lordship of Werle: Werle, Bisede (G√ºstrow), Teterow, Laage, Krakow, Malchow, Vipperow (R√∂bel), Turne and Liese. Later, possessions in Pomerania were added: Dargun, Malchin, Tucen and G√∂debant-T√ºtzen, G√§debehn (Stavenhagen), Sone-Schl√∂n (Waren/M√ºritz), as well as Wustrow (Penzlin) *Henry received the Lordship of Rostock: Kessin (Rostock), Kr√∂pelin, Doberan, Ribnitz, Marlow, S√ºlze and Tessin; Gnoien and Kalen were later added. The effects of the first partition lasted until 1471, when the territories were reunited by Henry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg through inheritance.  Second partition of Mecklenburg  The second partition of Mecklenburg took place in 1621 as a result of the Fahrenholzer Vertrag: a partition agreement, resulting in the Realteilung into the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. Although this division already existed (with interruptions) after the death of Henry IV in 1477 and again after 1520 (after the Neubrandenburger Hausvertrag (New Brandenburg House Contract)), it was only in the form of an allocation of √Ñmter (singular Amt; a type of administrative division), while general governance remained unified. In the agreement, Adolf Frederick I received the princely state of Schwerin, while his brother John Albert II received the land centred on G√ºstrow. The divisions had little historical basis. The most important goals were to divide the amount of territory and income as evenly as possible. In order to achieve this, Schwerin received the previously G√ºstrow-aligned √Ñmter of Grabow, Gorlosen, Marnitz, Neukloster and Sternberg including the Abbey of Walsm√ºhlen while G√ºstrow received the √Ñmter of Strelitz, Goldberg, Wredenhagen and F√ºrstenberg from Schwerin. Therefore, the two portions consisted of the following √Ñmter: :Schwerin: Schwerin, Crivitz, Neubukow, Poel, Doberan, Mecklenburg, Gadebusch, Zarrentin, Neustadt Eldena, D√∂mitz, Neukloster, Sternberg, L√ºbz, Rehna, Wittenburg, Marnitz, Grabow, Grevesm√ºhlen, Walsm√ºhlen and Gorlosen :G√ºstrow: G√ºstrow, Schwaan, Ribnitz, Gnoien, Dargun, Neukalen, Stavenhagen, Plan, Stargard, Broda, Feldberg, Wesenberg, Strelitz, Goldberg, Boizenburg, Wredenhagen, F√ºrstenberg, Ivenack and Wanzka Note however that the √Ñmter of Wredenhagen, F√ºrstenberg, Ivenack and Wanzka were de facto controlled by Pomerania. The cities were divided such that Schwerin received: Wismar, along with all the princely houses, Schwerin, Parchim, Waren and Kr√∂pelin; the noble towns of Br√ºel, Malchow and Dassow, as well as D√∂mitz and Zarrentin. G√ºstrow received: G√ºstrow, Laage, Krakow, Malchin, Robel, Teterow, Neubrandenburg, Friedland, Woldegk, Penzlin, S√ºlze and Marlow. It also gained the Elbe (despite its remoteness from G√ºstrow) as a result of gaining the Amt of Boizenburg. The town of Rostock including Warnem√ºnde remained a joint possession, as did the state's four Abbeys: Dobbertin, Malchow, Ribnitz and the Abbey of the Holy Cross in Rostock. The courts (Hofgericht and Landgericht), the Papal consistory, the State Diet, border disputes, the cost of the Reichskammergericht etc. also remained joint concerns.  Third partition of Mecklenburg  Mecklenburg after the third partition of Mecklenburg The third partition of Mecklenburg occurred as a result of the Treaty of Hamburg (1701) and divided the inheritance of territory of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow between Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the newly formed Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. These divisions would last until the end of the monarchy in 1918/19, albeit with reduced autonomy, and after that as the Free States of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz during the Weimar Republic. The two states were reunited in 1934 under Nazi influence.

There are two sections to the reserve, one on the left bank terraces of the Volga, at the actual meeting point of the rivers, the other section about 100 km up the Volga on the western outskirts of the city of Kazan. The reserve is situated in the Zelenodolsky Districts and Laishevsky District of Tatarstan. It was formally established in 1960 to protect remaining forest and forest-steppe habitat of the middle Volga region, and has an area of . A particular focus of scientific study is the effects of the Kuybyshev Reservoir on the local environment. The reservoir was completed in the mid-1950s, and is the largest reservoir in Europe. The Volga-Kama Reserve is part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Topography The Volga-Kama Reserve has two sections: * Raifa (30 km west of Kazan). The Raifa sector is a mostly flat or undulating karst landscape with a ravines and gullies, karst-terrain lakes, and southern taiga forest cover. Much of the forest is old-growth with trees aged 250‚Äì300 years. The Sumka River valley runs from northeast to southwest to the Volga through the Raifa section. A significant feature of this northern sector of the reserve is Raifa Lake, the largest of many lakes and marshes in the sector. * Sarala (60 km south of Kazan). The Sarala sector is a peninsula located on the Quaternary terraces of the Kuybyshev Reservoir. The reservoir was created in 1956, and has an elevation that fluctuates from 49 to 53 meters. This sector has mostly deciduous forest cover. The river valleys of the northern sector are at an absolute level of up to 66 meters; the higher areas in the north and south of the Raifa sector reach 120 meters. Climate and Ecoregion Volga-Kama Reserve is located in the East European forest steppe ecoregion, which is a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The climate of Volga-Kama is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The average temperature in the Volga-Kama Reserve ranges from in January to in July. Precipitation ranges from 490 ‚Äì 640 mm/year. Flora and fauna The two sectors of the reserve belong to two different biogeographic zones, as they straddle a moisture demarcation contour that separates the mixed coniferous-deciduous forests to the north from the deciduous forests to the south. The primary trees of the Raifa sector are spruce and Scots pine. Green moss is important in the Raifa sector, with sphagnum moss in the wetlands of the Raifa area. The trees of the southern Sarala section are of the deciduous forest, with oak communities and secondary forest of linden and aspen. Over 600 species of algae, and over 700 species of fungi, have been recorded in the reserve. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 844 species of vascular plants. The animal life of the northern sector (Raifa) are those of the southern taiga: voles, shrews, forest mice, bats, squirrels, marten, foxes, hares, and moose. The Sarala sector is more southern in character, with hares, wild boar, and roe deer. Beaver were reintroduced in 1996. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 50 species of mammals in the borders. Birds include forest birds and waterfowl, reflecting the variety of habitat in the area. 230 species of birds have been recorded. 41 species of fish have been recorded. Ecoeducation and access As a strict nature reserve, the Volga-Kama Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are limited 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to local residents, but require permits to be obtained in advance. The reserve sponsors an arboretum and a nature museum; they are visited by over 10 thousand people. The main office is in the city of Kazan.

Azulejo of the Virgin of las Madejas which occupies a niche under one of the arches of the aqueduct. The Ca√±os de Carmona (Pipes of Carmona, ) are the remains of a Roman aqueduct 17.5 kilometres long, later rebuilt by the Almohads, which connected the cities of Carmona and Seville, and which was fully operational until its demolition in 1912.Hemeroteca ABC (1911): Informaciones de Sevilla: Los ca√±os de Carmona (Spanish)Hemeroteca ABC (1912): Derribo de los ca√±os de Carmona (Spanish) It was primary constructed from bricks, and consisted of approximately 400 arches standing on pillars, with additional upper arcade sections in some places. It is believed to be the only example of this type of Roman construction in Spain.  History  The aqueduct was constructed approximately between 68 to 65 BC, the same period as the construction of the Walls of Seville and during Julius Caesar's term as quaestor. It was renovated and partially re-built between 1171 and 1172 by Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf. During this period, he also built the Giralda mosque and minaret, the Puente de Barcas on the Wad al-Kebir river, and the Buhaira palace and gardens, for which the aqueduct also supplied water. Additional repairs were made in the thirteenth century when the Granada War began. At the end of the fourteenth century it was renovated again and extended to its greatest length, however the precise location in which it began is unknown as there is some doubt that it actually was Carmona. An 1810 map of Spain and Portugal features an 'old aqueduct' that does indeed connect Carmona to Seville,Mapa de Espa√±a y Portugal, corregido y ampliado seg√∫n el mapa publicado por D. Tom√°s L√≥pez ‚Äî Biblioteca Digital Mundial (Spanish) but it is known to have been supplied by the Santa Luc√≠a spring in Alcal√° de Guada√≠ra where the aqueduct travelled underground through tunnels hewn into the rock or constructed from bricks, some of which weighed up to six kilograms. Around 20 access shafts were sunk into this section to allow maintenance workers to enter and exit the channel and ventilation. The aqueduct then processed up to the Puerta de Carmona‚Äîa former city gate which was demolished in 1868‚Äîwhere it disgorged into a great cistern from which the water was distributed to the rest of the city, primarily to the aristocracy, religious institutions, the Casa de Pilatos, the royal orchards, and a few fountains and public baths. It is from this gate which the aqueduct takes its name. The aqueduct was still functional right up until it was demolished and would have provided a flow rate of around 5000m¬≥ of potable water per day. At the time of its destruction, it was the highest-quality source of water for the city, as the underground galleries which formed it acted as a filtration system. In addition to providing drinking water, the aqueduct also drove a number of flour mills.  Demolition  Residents of the Puerta de Carmona and La Calzada neighbourhoods had complained to the City Hall since the 19th century of the danger posed by their section of the aqueduct, citing that its arches served as shelter for immigrants, the homeless, and criminals. The issues of health and social cohesion, together with extension plans for the city, led the city government to consult the Monuments Commission of the central administration. Madrid approved the plan, adding that the aqueduct \\"is a vulgar work, without artistic features, devoid of archaeological interest\\". A petition made by Jos√© Gestoso failed to stop its implementation, and demolition began on 26 January 1912. After several months, work had not been completed, and it was not until 1959 that the remaining sections were torn down to construct the neighbourhoods of La Candelaria and Los Pajaritos.\\"Los Ca√±os de Carmona\\", jaimepf.blogspot.com (Spanish)  Preservation  The Marquis of San Jos√© de Serra, Carlos Serra y Pickman, intervened in his capacity as Member of the Commission of Artistic Monuments of the Province to preserve sections of the monument, and three sections of the Ca√±os de Carmona were saved from demolition as a result. Three five-arch stretches of the aqueduct survive in Seville: * A single arcade located on Calle Cig√ºe√±a; * A double arcade on Calle Luis Montoto near the junction with Calle Jim√©nez Aranda; and * A second single arcade located at the start of Calle Luis Montoto. The second span survived thanks to the closure of the Alcantarilla de las Madejas orchard in 1911, which subsequently became privately owned. As this section was located on private land, the demolition team passed it by. During the construction of the Causeway Bridge, the Delegation of Public Works attempted to expropriate a portion of land from its owner, Mr. Borrero Blanco, in which the rest of the aqueduct was located, however it seemed to be a sensitive subject as local politicians granted a reprieve for this order.Archive newspaper article from ABC (Spanish) The third span was incorporated into the pillars of the Puente de la Calzada railway bridge when it was constructed in 1930, and was uncovered when the bridge was dismantled in 1991.Sevilla (Spain) on Roman Aqueducts Somewhat surprisingly, this section of the aqueduct is actually the best preserved. Upon its rediscovery, a niche which had previously contained an image of the Virgin Mary, known as the Virgin of las Madejas, was revealed. The previous image, which had been venerated for centuries, was transferred to the Church of San Roque in 1869 after it was attacked by revolutionaries, and it was burned and lapidate by Republicans in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War.Sevilla te quiero (Spanish) An azulejo reproduction produced by Juan Arag√≥n Cuesta in 1993 now occupies its place.Retablo cer√°mico (Spanish) Gallery File:Aqueduct Ca√±os de Carmona Seville.jpgSection of Ca√±os de Carmona and Puerta de Carmona gate in Seville File:Puerta de Carmona Aqueduct Ca√±os de Carmona.jpgSection of Ca√±os de Carmona attached to the Puerta de Carmona File:Ca√±os-de-carmona- litografiada-de-joaqu√≠n-guichot-1860.jpgCa√±os de Carmona (c. 1860) See also *Italica References Category:Roman aqueducts outside Rome Category:Moorish architecture in Spain Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 1st century BC Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1172 Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 14th century Category:Buildings and structures in Seville Category:Ancient Roman buildings and structures in Spain Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Seville Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1912 ","title":"Ca√±os de Carmona"},{"id":"50496176","text":"XHWA-FM is a radio station on 98.5 FM in Xalapa, Veracruz.

He started at the age of eight performing as a background actor and bit player in various movies and television series. He entered the animation industry at the age of 18 with Hanna-Barbera Productions. He is currently developing and producing a number of animated and live action projects through his own company, Gold Medal Productions. Early life and education McNeil was born in Inglewood, California in the Los Angeles area, (specifically Inglewood) of California in 1957. Always interested in television, McNeil became a member of the Screen Children's Guild. For the next several years, McNeil worked on a variety of different shows and movies, including 13 episodes of \\"The Brady Bunch\\", \\"Family Affair\\", \\"Cowboy In Africa\\", \\"The Partridge Family\\", and \\"Archie's Funhouse\\" {as one of the live action kids in the audience} for his future animation studio employer Filmation Associates. Even more than acting, he wanted to do animation. In 1966, when the first of animated series produced specifically for the nascent \\"Saturday Morning Television\\" time period began airing, he was especially impressed by Hanna-Barbera's \\"Space Ghost and Dino Boy\\". He decided he would not only strive to become an animator, but that he would work for Hanna-Barbera, meet and befriend the main people involved with Space Ghost, and work on Space Ghost himself and get his name in the credits for it....all of which he eventually managed to do. After graduating from Westchester High School in 1975, McNeil attended Cal State University Long Beach where he took an animation history class taught by veteran Hanna-Barbera producer Art Scott. At a UCLA \\"Saturday Morning\\" class he met William Hanna and Joseph Barber themselves, and was encouraged by Barbera to pitch some of his own show concepts as possible H+B shows. He thus became the first black H-B writer/artist as well as the youngest creator (age 18) to sell animated show concepts. Three of the seven series he pitched were optioned. Hanna encouraged McNeil to enter H-B's then new training program, which the studio had created to train the next generation of animation artists. Animation career While still 18, McNeil was hired by H-B to become an inbetweener for the studio. He met and became close friends with Space Ghost developer/creator Alex Toth and Space Ghost voice Gary Owens. He eventually served as lead layout artist on a revival of \\"Space Ghost\\" in 1980. Starting with Hanna- Barbera in 1976, McNeil worked for numerous animation studios over the next four decades, including Filmation Associates, Ruby-Spears, DIC, Bakshi, Encore, Saban, Marvel, Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, Disney, Invision, Calico, Vignette, Don Bluth, Universal, Warner Bros, Stan Lee/The Firm, and even a stint at Paramount animating special effects for the first \\"Star Trek\\" feature film. Due to a decision made early in his career to leave working for union animation studios and to work mainly for local non-union studio subcontractors Hutten/Love, McNeil got no screen credit for much of the work and many of the series he worked for. Writing career McNeil also became a noted animation historian, particularly with the studios that produced television animation in the 60s thru the 70's. He started writing about his work on and about various Saturday morning cartoons shortly after he first began animating. Starting with a yearly correspondence with the writer/editor of DC Comics \\"Super Friends\\" comic book, E. Nelson Bridwell, he started writing about and covering comic book based animation and live-action productions for a number of publications and periodicals, including The Comics Reader, Comics Buyers Guide (CBG), Comics Scene, and TOON Magazine (which he cofounded) among many others. He later co-wrote two animation books, \\"Hanna-Barbera's World of Super Adventure\\" and \\"Animation by Filmation\\". He later joined with his long time mentor and closest friend, legendary comic book/animation artist Alex Toth, to co-write \\"Alex Toth: By Design\\". Producing career Under auspices of his Gold Medal Productions, McNeil has created over a hundred new concepts over the decades, several of them co-developed with Alex Toth. He optioned nearly a dozen concepts to various companies including Hanna-Barbera, Encore Enterprises, Riverstar Entertainment, and JDL Productions. Some of these are currently in the process of being launched on the web via his streaming subscription based website, \\"Big D's PC-TV\\".

In March 2018 Mehajer was declared bankrupt and in April 2018 was found guilty of electoral fraud, and sentenced to 21 months in prison with a non-parole period of 11 months. Biography =Early life and education= Mehajer was born in Sydney, and is the third-eldest of eight children of Lebanese immigrants Amal and Mohamed Mehajer. He grew up in the Auburn area and was educated at the local primary school before attending Trinity Catholic College, Auburn for the majority of his high school years. Mehajer finished his final years at Arthur Phillip High School in Parramatta and subsequently studied at Western Sydney University, graduating with a Bachelor of Housing degree in April 2010.Western Sydney University has an online award verification service. To confirm Salim Mehajer's degree and conferral date, enter his first and last names and click on the search button. Mehajer was featured in an advertisement in the Auburn Review, paid for by the not-for-profit Australian Community Association of which Mehajer was president at the time, which states he also attained a Masters of Environmental Systems, Markets and Climate Change. However, although he enrolled in an environmental engineering course at the University of New England (UNE), a spokesperson from UNE stated that he never completed it. Mehajer's parents, Mohamad and Amal, have come to the attention of Australian authorities in relation to unpaid taxes worth almost $10 million. Mohamad has previously been sentenced to 3.5 years prison for bribery and fraud in an attempt to defraud the National Australia Bank. Political career Mehajer ran as an independent member of the Legislative Assembly for Auburn at the 2011 New South Wales state election. He was subsequently investigated by the Election Funding Authority of New South Wales for failing to declare electoral spending and political donations but, as he was not elected, no action was taken against him. He was elected as an independent councillor for the City of Auburn in 2011, and was subsequently elected as deputy mayor. In 2014 the Division of Local Government conducted an investigation into Mehajer's pecuniary interests and suspended him from civic office for a month for failing to disclose his business and property interests. = Suspension of job as deputy mayor = In September 2015, Mehajer faced accusations of conflict of interest in decisions made by the local council. The New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal ordered Mehajer to be suspended for four months for his failure to disclose financial interests. Mehajer appeared on Nine News in October 2015 with his wife, and from a lectern gave an interview with a reporter. In the interview, he said \\"I would like to start off by being in state, federal and I'd like to make my way up to the very top spot. That would [be] my dream come true\\" and denied claims that he was part of a group of six councillors who were accused of banding together to push through development applications. Reaction to the interview ranged from it being called a \\"bizarre stage-managed spectacle\\" by The Huffington Post, to criticism from radio host Ray Hadley in an interview with the Today show's host Karl Stefanovic. The suspension of the deputy mayor was overturned on appeal in February 2016 however the entire council had been suspended by this time. = Suspension of Auburn City Council, and public enquiry = The NSW Government later suspended the entire Sydney's Auburn City Council in February 2016 and appointed an administrator while a public inquiry examined the allegations of councillors misusing their positions. The appointed administrator scrapped two major developments which could benefit Mehajer. Auburn City Council was abolished on 12 May 2016 by the NSW Government. Parts of Auburn City Council (south of the M4 Western Motorway) and Parramatta City Council (Woodville Ward), and Holroyd City Council merged to form the Cumberland Council as a new local government area. The remainder of the Auburn City Council area north of the M4 Western Motorway (including Sydney Olympic Park) was merged into the City of Parramatta Council. A later public enquiry held in November 2016 found no adverse findings against Mehajer or Sydney's Auburn City Council in regard to his development applications. The minister believed that this was due to the limited powers of the inquiry and referred the matter to the independent commission against corruption. = Failing to declare political donations = On 14 November 2017, Mehajer pleaded guilty of failing to declare political donations and was fined $3,300 and ordered to pay costs of $3,487. = Conviction of electoral fraud = After an ongoing investigation by the Australian Electoral Commission, on 15 June 2017 Mehajer was charged with over 100 electoral fraud offences along with his sister, Fatima, while he was the deputy Mayor of Auburn. Fatima pleaded guilty to 77 counts of giving false or misleading information to the Australian Electoral Commission. In April 2018 he was found guilty of electoral fraud and was sentenced on 22 June 2018 to 21 months in prison with a non-parole period of 11 months. Mehajer began to appeal the length of the non-parole period, but abandoned the appeal in February 2019 when the judge said she would consider an application from the Crown for a higher sentence. Marriage and separation Mehajer came to public prominence in Australia and overseas after his 2015 marriage to his fianc√© Aysha (formerly April Amelia Learmonth) was widely publicised in the media. The media focused on Mehajer's manner of arrival, which involved flying in one of four helicopters then proceeding to the wedding in a fleet of luxury sports cars, and for his wedding video which was widely shown on media sites in Australia. During the event, he was accused of closing Frances Street in Lidcombe without authorisation, and for distributing fake notices warning residents that their cars would be towed if they were not cleared from the street, and later fined $220. Aysha later separated from Mehajer in April 2016. Following this, in July 2016, Aysha applied for and received an apprehended violence order (AVO) against Mehajer on the grounds she felt intimidated. In November 2017, police alleged that Mehajer had breached the AVO taken out by his ex-wife. The breaches related to him driving to the laneway behind her home and posting a picture on Instagram of the couple when they were still together. On 24 April 2018 the judge found that Mehajer did not contravene the AVO on the grounds the prosecution had not proven he knew the conditions of the AVO, however he was found guilty of intimidatory conduct after he allegedly sent over 400 messages to her after the pair had separated. He was placed on an 18-month good behaviour bond. He has reportedly \\"moved on\\" and has a new partner.  Criminal charges and convictions  = Fraud charges and convictions = Mehajer has received a number of convictions for fraud. On 15 June 2017, Mehajer was charged with over 100 electoral fraud offences, and was found guilty in April 2018. On 22 June 2018 he was sentenced to 21 months in prison with a non-parole period of 11 months. He was released on 21 May 2019. On 23 January 2018, Mehajer was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and with perverting the course of justice with regard to a car crash that occurred on 16 October 2017. He was refused bail, with the magistrate stating that the case \\"strikes at the very core of the justice system\\". Mehajer was released on 4 April 2018 after $200,000 bail was posted, his conditions of bail include reporting to the police twice a day, but actually he attended court each day as his electoral fraud trial was underway. = Apprehended violence orders and conviction for intimidation = Mehajer was accused of threatening personal trainer Bruce Herat in October 2015 after a disagreement at a gymnasium. Mehajer was subsequently charged with intimidation by police and had an apprehended violence order (AVO) taken out against him. The AVO prohibited Mehajer from entering Herat's workplace, Anytime Fitness Gym in Burwood. According to Herat, Mehajer used offensive and threatening language towards him. However, the charges were later dismissed by the magistrate because the security camera had been broken in the council car park, where the alleged confrontation occurred, and he had no way of knowing for certain that Mehajer had threatened Herat, however, the AVO was extended by a further 12 months. A later appeal against the extension was dismissed. = Assault convictions = On 2 April 2017 Mehajer allegedly assaulted a taxi driver outside the Star Casino in Sydney, by throwing an EFTPOS machine at the taxi driver's face. He also allegedly took the driver's mobile phone and threw it out of the car. Mehajer took a plea deal and pled guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and destroying or damaging property. Mehajer was ordered to pay compensation of just over $600 and enter into a three-year good behaviour bond. On the same day, Mehajer was also accused of deliberately shutting a car door on a Seven News reporter's hand, and was subsequently charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 23 February 2018 he was found guilty due to the reckless nature of closing the door without looking, however the judge recorded a conviction without imposing any other penalty due to the \\"appalling and predatory behaviour\\" of the media pack who pursued him. = Drug charges = On 28 March 2018, Mehajer was charged with two counts of possessing and one count of supplying a prohibited drug, police allegedly found more than 200 anxiety and painkiller pills ‚Äì 50 alprazolam (Xanax) tablets, and 174 Endone and Targin tablets ‚Äì at the property developer's Lidcombe mansion during a raid on 8 November 2017. The Australian reported that he was convicted on 19 August 2020 of one count of possessing 63 Endone pills which had been found in six locations in his house, and in his manbag. Despite requesting leniency, the magistrate stated that as \\"there has been somewhat of a history of offending over the last years\\" then she could only conclude that the \\"extremely powerful drugs and the sheer numbers of them alert the court to the misuse, and to a degree of criminality that must be attached to that offending.\\" He was sentenced to a 12-month conditional release order.  Disqualified from managing corporations, companies placed in administration  In August 2016 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission banned Mehajer from managing any corporation for three years \\"as a means of protecting others from his incompetence\\". His failed companies owed more than one million dollars to the Australian Taxation Office. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld a previous ban that was appealed by Mehajer, who also sought a suppression of the proceedings to remain out of the public eye.  Civil suits, and bankruptcy  = Pursued for unpaid bill for staircase = Mehajer had a marble staircase installed in his home. The company that installed it states they were not paid for their work. \\"The Greenacre company sued him and won, with NSW District Court Judge Judith Gibson in October ordering Mehajer to pay up to almost $1 million ‚Äì the cost of the staircase and about $400,000 to cover Prime Marble's court costs.\\" =Pursued by Administrator = The liquidator, Anthony Elkerton of Dean- Willcocks Advisory, is pursuing Mehajer and his business partner for $672,297 plus interest and costs. Tim Orlizki of law firm Kent Attorneys appeared in the Supreme Court seeking leave to withdraw from acting for Mr Mehajer in the liquidator's proceedings before a three-day hearing started, as he had not been paid. = Bankruptcy = On 14 August 2017, he had put his million-dollar house up for lease due to ongoing legal battles. On 20 March 2018, a federal court judge declared Mehajer bankrupt, and appointed a trustee to manage his property and financial affairs. Driving offences =Car crash (2012)= Mehajer was involved in a serious car crash on 17 January 2012 when he lost control of his Ferrari 612 Scaglietti at the crest of The Boulevarde in Lidcombe and ran over two women before colliding with a wall. The two women were rushed to Westmead Hospital where they underwent surgery for serious leg and pelvic injuries. They were released from hospital after spending a month in recovery. Mehajer was convicted of negligent driving on 23 October 2012 at Burwood Local Court where he had his license disqualified and was sentenced to 150 hours of community service by magistrate Brian Maloney. Mehajer appealed and in September 2013 the conviction was overturned. The two injured women later sued him in 2014 and Mehajer reached a settlement with them in early October 2015, agreeing to pay AUD$1.72 million which was paid by his insurers, NRMA. =Demerit points and stamp duty= Mehajer is under investigation for undervaluing his luxury cars to avoid stamp duty and demerit point shifting to other parties for driving offences. Mehajer is still under investigation. =Car crashes October and November (2017)= On 16 October 2017, while on his way to court to face charges, the vehicle in which he was travelling was involved in a crash and he was taken to hospital. Mehajer claimed that he was not the driver. In the early hours of 20 November 2017, Mehajer was arrested following a car crash in Kingsgrove in Sydney's south. He was charged with one count of dangerous driving. On 23 January 2018, Mehajer was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and with perverting the course of justice with regard to the 16 October crash. On 24 January 2018, a magistrate refused Mehajer bail stating that the case \\"strikes at the very core of the justice system\\". Mehajer was released on 4 April 2018 after $200,000 bail was posted. His conditions include reporting to police twice a day.  Custodial sentences  On 23 January 2018, Mehajer was placed in custody of Silverwater Correctional Complex on remand for 10 weeks. Mehajer was released on 4 April 2018 after $200,000 bail was posted. On 22 June 2018, Mehajer was sentenced to 21 months prison relating to 77 charges of electoral fraud. The sister of Mehajer, Fatima Mehajer was given a two-month suspended prison sentence for her role in the scam. Mehajer will be eligible for parole after 11 months. In August 2018 it was reported Mehajer is incarcerated in Cooma Correctional Centre, during this sentence it has been reported that Mehajer allegedly assaulted a prison officer and had been placed on a 14-day segregation order. On 19 December 2018, during a court appearance in Sydney Federal Court Mehajer stated he would be released from prison by 21 March 2019 at the latest. This would mean Mehajer would only serve nine months of his 21-month sentence, despite reports of assaulting a prison officer and stockpiling medication during his time in Cooma Correctional Centre. Mehajer was released on 21 May 2019, having served an 11-month sentence.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/21/salim-mehajer- leaves-jail-after-11-months-and-walks-straight-into-more-legal-woes References Category:1986 births Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Australian fraudsters Category:Australian Muslims Category:Australian people of Lebanese descent Category:Criminals from Sydney Category:Living people Category:New South Wales local government politicians Category:Deputy mayors of places in Australia Category:Real estate and property developers ","title":"Salim Mehajer"},{"id":"50496553","text":"Francisco de Borja Valenzuela R√≠os (10 October 1917 ‚Äì 20 February 1998) was a Chilean bishop.

Nieto was a bouncer at a local nightclub, and the shooting was before he was to start work that evening. A confrontation between Nieto and another civilian led to a bystander calling 911. Nieto was wearing a taser, and the police officers alleged that Nieto pointed the taser at them. The responding police officers also said they believed that the taser was a firearm. The San Francisco County District Attorney's Office declined to file criminal charges against the four officers involved in the shooting.

Around 7:00 pm on the night of March 21, 2014, he was walking along the path of a hilltop park called \\"Bernal Heights Park\\", eating tortilla chips, and wearing a red San Francisco 49ers jacket, black 49ers cap, white t-shirt, and black pants. Under his 49ers jacket, he wore a holstered taser that he used for his job as a bouncer. A local resident named Evan Snow was walking his dog near Nieto. Snow's dog Luna was unleashed, barking and chased Nieto up onto a bench trying to get at his food. Nieto and Snow conversed briefly and went their separate ways. Snow allegedly used racial slurs and texted a friend that \\"in another state like Florida, I would have been justified in shooting Mr. Nieto that night.\\" Tim Isgitt and partner Justin Fritz were walking their dog shortly thereafter. Noting a rattled Nieto who had his hand on his taser, Fritz called 911, reporting a man with a handgun wearing a red jacket, and further insinuated that the jacket's color was associated with gang activity. One witness who did see Nieto shortly after Isgitt and Fritz, longtime Bernal Heights resident Robin Bullard who was walking his own dog in the park, testified that there was nothing alarming about him. \\"He was just sitting there,\\" Bullard said. Police Lieutenant Jason Sawyer and Officer Richard Schiff responded to the call and confronted Nieto as he was walking on a path in the same park. They testified that he pointed the taser at them when asked to show his hands, prompting them to open fire on Nieto. Officers Roger Morse and Nathan Chew provided backup, and later fired 14 rounds at Nieto, claiming they saw muzzle fire. According to a report by the city's District Attorney George Gasc√≥n, the officers fired a total of 59 shots: Schiff went through an entire magazine, shooting 23 bullets at Nieto while Sawyer fired 20 bullets, allegedly in response to Nieto pointing a taser, which they mistook for a pistol. Lawsuit Alex's parents retained the Law Offices of John Burris and filed a federal civil rights claim arguing the police wrongfully shot their son. The trial ended on March 10, 2016, and a jury unanimously cleared the four officers of all charges. It was found that the taser's clock, which showed that the weapon's trigger had been pulled. Nieto's prior issues with mental health were discussed, as toxicology reports found he was not on medication when he was killed. Also discussed were two separate incidents in 2011 when Nieto had contact with law enforcement and resulted in 72-hour mental health holds. The family argued that the police used excessive force and that there was contradictory evidence and details about what happened.  Response  Elvira Nieto, mother of Alex Nieto, speaks at a March 2016 protest against police violence Nieto's death and the verdict sparked waves of demonstrations and rallies in the Bay Area, protesting against police brutality and excessive use of force against minority groups amidst calls for SFPD Chief Greg Suhr's resignation. In March 2016, on the day before Nieto's trial started, San Francisco public school children staged a walk out from school in protest. The protests and the ensuing debate included calls for policing reforms and the threats faced by Latino communities increasingly displaced by gentrification in the city. After the publication of the verdict, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California published a piece pointing at racial bias within SFPD and calling for urgent policing reform. On April 21, 2016, five protesters started a 17-day hunger strike in San Francisco's Mission District to demonstrate against recent police killings, including Alex Nieto's death. On May 19, 2016, Police Chief Suhr resigned after an officer-involved killing of a 29-year-old woman. Jessica Williams was shot by San Francisco police in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood during a car chase.

The book was also illustrated by Hurley, and won the Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers in 1948.\\"Book Society Award\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 16 November 1948, p2  Book summary  Frank Hurley was the official photographer attached to Ernest Shackleton's 1914 expedition to the Antarctic. Known as the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Shackleton's aim was to ship his party to the head of the Weddell Sea and then cross the continent to the Ross Sea with a small party by dog sledge. But things went wrong from the start when their ship, the Endurance, was caught and crushed in ice-packs. After months surviving on the ice, the expedition finally made it to Elephant Island. From there Shackleton undertook an open-boat journey to South Georgia to organise a rescue, which, after some months and several attempts, was finally successful. Hurley was able to save some negatives from the expedition and used a number to illustrate the book. Critical reception Geoffrey Hutton in The Argus found the book a simple tale told well: \\"This is a plain tale told by a famous Australian explorer of the near- disaster which befell Shackleton's dauntless company when the Endurance was crushed by pack-ice in the Weddell Sea...Hurley travelled with Shackleton as official photographer, a role he had filled in Mawson's expedition of 1911-14, and his book is enriched by a magnificent pictorial record of the Antarctic, a series which largely, paid off the backers of the expedition. His name, and that of his famous leader, are a reminder that Australia has played an important role in the exploration of the continent from which our weather is largely dictated, and in which we lay claim to an area almost as large as Australia itself.\\"\\"About Antarctica\\" by Geoffrey Hutton, The Argus, 6 November 1948, p21 See also * 1948 in Australian literature References Category:Australian children's books Category:1948 children's books Category:Children's history books Category:CBCA Children's Book of the Year Award-winning works Category:Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition Category:Angus & Robertson books ","title":"Shackleton's Argonauts"},{"id":"50496605","text":"Bernadine Bezuidenhout (born 14 September 1993 in Kimberley, Northern Cape) is an international cricketer who played for South Africa national women's cricket team between 2014 and 2015 before moving to Christchurch, New Zealand and has since represented the New Zealand White Ferns, after a three-year stand down period.

He was elected consul for the year 477. He unsuccessfully fought the Veiientes, and was later prosecuted by the tribunes of the plebs for his failure to prevent the disaster of the Cremera.  Family  Menenius was the son of Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, who was consul in 503 BC, and the grandson of Gaius Menenius. He was the father of Lucius Menenius Agrippa Lanatus, consul in 440 BC and Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, the consul of 439 and consular tribune in 419 and 417.  Life  Menenius was consul in 477 BC, together with Gaius Horatius Pulvillus.Per the Varronian chronology. Dionysius of Halicarnassus dates their consulship to \\"the seventy-sixth Olympiad (the one at which Scamander of Mitylene won the foot-race), when Phaedo was archon at Athens\\" or 475 BC. (Roman Antiquities, ix. 18.) The Senate entrusted the conduct of the war against Veii to him, in support of the Fabian gens, who were guarding the frontier against the Etruscan city, while his colleague prepared to face the Volscians.Livy, ii. 50, 51. When the Fabii were ambushed at the Cremera, Menenius failed to intervene, although his forces were close enough to turn the tide without losing the strategic position. Not only were the Fabii destroyed and their position lost, but the Veientes continued toward Rome, where they defeated Menenius and occupied the Janiculum. Horatius Pulvillus was recalled in haste to defend the city. While Horatius won a first battle on the Janiculum against the Veientes, it was the consuls of the following year who were able to defeat the enemy and drive them out of Roman territory.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, ii. 51.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, ix. 23, 24. In 476 BC, after he had left office, Menenius was prosecuted by the tribunes Quintus Considius and Titus Genucius, ostensibly for his conduct of military operations during his consulate, in particular for allowing the gens Fabia to be slaughtered. However, Livy points out that the prosecution may have been motivated more by his opposition to the agrarian law that the plebeians been calling for since the death of Spurius Cassius Viscellinus in 486. He was defended by the Senate as strenuously as they defended Coriolanus a few years earlier, and was helped by the reputation of his father, who was popular for having reconciled the plebeians and patricians after the first secession of the plebs.Livy, ii. 52. According to Livy, Menenius was able to avoid the death penalty or exile, and was fined 2000 asses; but unable to bear his humiliation, Menenius soon fell sick and died. However, Cassius Dio reports that Menenius was sentenced to death by the court (likely based on ancient sources that still use the term \\"lender\\" to mean a consul).Cassius Dio, Roman History, v. 21.

The group was led by Bobby Lawson and was known for their hard, blues-based sound which, as they evolved, increasingly incorporated esoteric psychedelic elements. The group regularly worked with musician, songwriter, and producer Jim Dickinson and cut the first rock release for Memphis label, Ardent Records. As a side-project, they briefly recorded under the name The Avengers, as a Batman-themed takeoff group in 1966. History Lawson and Four More were formed by Bobby Lawson in Memphis Tennessee in 1965. The group's original name was Bobby and the Originals, and their membership consisted of Lawson on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Joe Lee on lead guitar, Joe Gaston on bass, Bernie Hill on keyboards, and Bill Donati on drums. Eventually keyboardist Bernie left and was replaced by Terry Manning, who was from El Paso, Texas. Manning had played in an El Paso Group called the Wild Ones and had played with Bobby Fuller there. Lawson played regularly at Skateland Frayser. They made an appearance on the local TV show, Talent Party. A high school friend of the band arranged for them to cut demos at the home recording studio of John Fry. After hearing the band, Fry liked what he heard and called his friend Jim Dickinson, a well-known songwriter and session player in Memphis, and Dickinson wrote two songs for the band to record, \\"If You Want Me, You Can Find Me\\" and \\"Back for More\\". At the sessions, for the A side, Dickinson played keyboards and brought in Jimmy Crosthwaite to play maracas onto a cardboard box, and Charlie Hull and Lee Baker to handle the lead guitar parts. The band members themselves played the parts for the B side, \\"Back For More.\\" Dickinson also took on the role of producer and the two songs were released as a single on the local Ardent label in 1966, with \\"If You Want Me, You Can Find Me\\" as the A-side. The song has an intense, bluesy edge and is set to a rubbery beat. \\"Back for More\\" was also in a similar blues-based vein. The record was the first rock record to be released by Ardent. While making the single, the group changed its name to Lawson & More, and their new name appeared both the record's label and on the specially printed outer sleeve for the record, which featured a photograph of the group on its front cover. After the release of the single, the members of Lawson and Four More did a side-project together with Jim Dickinson as a novelty Batman- themed takeoff group, the Avengers, who wore \\"Batman\\" and \\"Robin\\" costumes. Under this brief aegis they released a single featuring the eerie instrumental A-Side \\"Batarang\\", featuring Terry Manning's tingling organ lines and scorching lead guitar provided by Lee Baker. On the flip-side, they backed a group of singers, the Robins, on vocals, while Jim Dickinson joined in on 12-string guitar. Production was credited to Uncle John‚Äôs Gang, which was John Fry‚Äôs unit, including Jim Dickinson. The Avengers made several appearances/gigs (along with the Robins), which sometimes included a specially made \\"Batmobile\\", which was specially customized from a Buick. Lawson and Four More followed up with a second single under their regular name for Ardent, \\"\\"Halfway Down the Stairs\\" b/w \\"Relax Your Mind\\" that showed the group evolving further in a psychedelic direction. The single gained airplay in the Memphis area and the band went on a package tour that included the Yardbirds. As the band moved further into psychedelia, their sound became less danceable and they began to destroy equipment onstage, which made them less appealing to the audiences at local venues such as Skateland Frayser and elsewhere. In 1967 Bobby Lawson left the group and formed Lawson's Blues Bag. The remaining members continued as the Goat Dancers for a brief time. Lawson and Four More's brand of hard blues-based rock predicted the approach of later Memphis bands such as Moloch and Snake, who became popular at the end of the 1960s. Keyboardist Terry Manning went on to form Rock City with Chris Bell and Jody Stevens before those two formed Big Star with Alex Chilton and Andy Hummel, recorded as a solo artist, and became a successful record producer and engineer starting in the 1970s. Joe Gaston went on to play with several other groups and has gone on to be a respected blues musician in Memphis, playing at the Center for Southern Folklore. Lawson and Four More's work has come to the attention of garage rock and psychedelic enthusiasts. In 2013 Ace released \\"If You Want Me You Can Find Me\\" as an A-Sided on a seven-inch single, along with the previously unissued \\"Smart Bird\\". The Goatdancers are on the cover of the acclaimed FEELING HIGH: THE PSYCHEDELIC SOUND OF MEMPHIS (Ace Big Bear 2013), a compilation selling around the world, from Poland to Thailand. Bill Donati's \\"Nuclear Surfer,\\" directed by Ben J. Harrison, is a satire of nuclear power (YOUTUBE). Donati has written, recorded, and produced five original CDs (billdonati.com).

To the right in the picture is a carnival where a minotaur is cheered on a stage, while to the left another minotaur is about to be burned at the stake. The picture also includes several other people and creatures. The title is taken from the poem \\"Waiting for the Barbarians\\" by Constantine P. Cavafy. It was one of fourteen paintings in Rauch's exhibition Para, which was made for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and exhibited there in 2007. It is kept at The Broad in Los Angeles. Description To the left, under a clear blue sky, is a barrack, and in front of it a minotaur is strapped to a stake prepared with firewood. In the middle of the picture, a woman lies on her back with a ball in her hand, while a creature with a long red beak touches her breast with a rod. Behind her is another woman who looks out to the left, and behind her a black panther is turned to the right. In the right part of the picture is a carnival with a shooting gallery and a stage where a minotaur is presented to a cheering audience. The painting was made using oil on canvas and has the dimensions 150 x 400 centimeter. Reception Reviewing the Para exhibition for The New York Times, Roberta Smith wrote that \\"only two paintings have color that really sings and draws you toward them\\", of which one was Waiting for the Barbarians and the other was The Next Move. Smith described the painting's \\"intense blue sky and flailing figures in red, yellow and blue\\", and compared the reclining woman in the picture to \\"a version of Eve or the Madonna who has toppled out of Renaissance painting without dropping her main prop.\\" Largely unimpressed by the exhibition as a whole, Smith wrote that \\"the painting that makes the most sense is Waiting for the Barbarians, in which a Minotaur, or a man dressed as one, is taken to a small stage, like Christ before the people, while another burns at the stake.\\" According to Smith, this distinguished the painting from the rest of the exhibition, which she described as \\"unassembled and formulaic\\". Mario Naves of the New York Observer compared Waiting for the Barbarians to Balthus' 1936 painting The Mountain, and wrote: > The canvases bear an uncanny resemblance to each other, but Mr. Rauch‚Äôs > enigmatic panorama is too unsettled and stern to succumb to the French > master‚Äôs brittle nostalgia. However despondent the scenario or antiquated > the imagery, a painting by Mr. Rauch points forward‚Äîalbeit in ways that are > hard to pin down.

He was assassinated about 660 A.C., probably on the instruction of Clotaire III, meeting the same fate as other bishops who defied Clotair's authority. Hagiography There are two theories regarding the life and death of Ferjus. A summary of his life written in the seventeenth century recounts that Saint Ferjus, was preaching at Mount Esson (Current Mont Rachais) above Grenoble when he was overwhelmed by an assassin who struck him on the head and threw him into a burning oven. Grenoble was buried in the church where he used to preach, which subsequently was dedicated in his name. The second theory is that Ferjus was assassinated around 660 A.C., by Clotaire III or the mayor of the palace Ebroin, like other bishops who defied his authority. His feast day is 12 January. Legacy The relics of Saint Ferjus are preserved in La Tronche located in the suburbs of Grenoble. Until 1935, the bell tower of St. Mary in Grenoble carried statues of Saint-Bruno, Saint-Hugues, St. Ferjus and St. Francis de Sales. In 1935, the tower threatened to collapse and the four statues were removed. The four sculptures disappeared during the Second World War, and only the statue of Francis de Sales was found in 2007 in Thiers Street, in the garden of the sanatorium which closed down.http://www.musee-dauphinois.fr/2073-nouvelles- acquisitions.htm The statue of Ferjus remains lost.

It was founded in 1874 and was included on the register of objects of cultural heritage in 1978 as a unique example of a vivarium. The zoo started as a few animals kept by a restaurant owner in the early 1870s. It can thus be considered the oldest continuously operating Polish zoological garden. Together with the New Zoo in Pozna≈Ñ, which opened in 1974, it forms an integral part of the whole complex known as The Zoological Garden in Pozna≈Ñ (Ogr√≥d Zoologiczny w Poznaniu). The zoo is a member of both the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. History The zoo traces its origins to 1871, when a group of local bowlers and regulars of a restaurant at Starogard-Pozna≈Ñ railway station in Je≈ºyce decided to give President of Bowling Association an unusual birthday present. Each of the bowling players brought a different animal including a pig, a goat, a sheep, a cat, a rabbit, a squirrel, a goose, a duck, a chicken, a peacock as well as a trained bear and a monkey. This small menagerie was gradually expanded thanks to animals given by local inhabitants of Pozna≈Ñ and eventually became the foundation of the future zoo. In 1874, the joint stock company called \\"The Zoological Garden\\" was formally established. In 1875, the Zoological Garden Society was founded and consisted of 15 members who held their positions up until the outbreak of World War One. The Management Board of the society consisted of such figures as Franciszek Ch≈Çapowski, Ludwik Frankiewicz and Count Wawrzyniec Benzelstjerna Engestr√∂m. In 1877, the complex officially assumed the name of a Zoological Garden, the inscription being written on a bilingual Polish-German board at the main entrance to the zoo. In 1880, the collection comprised 250 animals representing 59 species. The garden developed rapidly and regular concerts, shows and other cultural events were organized at the zoo. The zoo underwent major renovations and expansions during the tenure of Robert Jaeckel (1851-1907) and his close aide Stanis≈Çaw Zieli≈Ñski (1844-1928). These included the building of the Alpinarium, the Elephants' Pavilion, deer and ostriches enclosures, as well as an aviary. In 1886, the management of the zoo negotiated the purchase of land from the Prussian Eastern Railways and after five years the area of the zoo increased to 5.24 hectares. In 1909, the zoological garden housed a collection of 900 animals of more than 400 species and the annual number of visitors amounted to 250,000. In 1913 and 1914, Johann Strauss III gave concerts at the zoo in Pozna≈Ñ. In July 1914 a major ethnographic exhibition presenting tribes of the Nile valley was organized. Elephant Kinga at the Pozna≈Ñ Zoo After the end of World War One, the zoo experienced a period of decline and the number of visitors decreased. In 1919, when the Polish authorities took control of the zoo, it was in possession of just 243 animals of 74 species that survived the war including Indian elephants, emu, condor and African wild ass. Boles≈Çaw Cylkowski was appointed the new director of the Pozna≈Ñ Zoo and was assigned the difficult task of rebuilding and modernizing the zoo. In 1922, his successor Kazimierz Szczerkowski managed to restore the garden to its former glory. During the Interwar period, the zoo started to thrive and attract more and more visitors. Thanks to Szczerkowski's efforts the zoo joined the international Society for the Protection of the European Bison, which greatly contributed to saving this species from the brink of extinction. He also started collaborations with other zoological gardens from Poland and abroad. The zoo acquired new animals in 1923 such as lions, Bengal tiger, leopard and Malayan tapir, in 1924 polar bears, California sea lions, European bisons and in 1927 koniks. Upon the opening of the first State National Exhibition in 1929 (now the Pozna≈Ñ International Fair) a new pavilion and facilities were built, while other were adapted to new purposes. The zoo was visited by approximately 700,000 people during the Exhibition. The Lion Monument Before the start of World War II, the Pozna≈Ñ Zoo was home to 1184 animals representing 300 species. Only as few as 175 animals survived the war (e.g. wolves, deer and a hippopotamus) and many zoo buildings were destroyed. On 20 January 1945, Wies≈Çaw Rakowski was chosen as the director of the zoo. He was also the director of the Natural Museum which operated on the premises on the zoo. Many animals were transferred from other places to Pozna≈Ñ including ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Leszno and the ruined Wroc≈Çaw Zoo. In 1949, Rakowski was succeeded by Boles≈Çaw Witkowski who continued the renovation of the garden after the war. In 1955, Indian elephant named Kinga, one of the most popular and favourite animals in the history of the Pozna≈Ñ Zoo, was transported from Indochina. She died in 2003 after her 50th birth anniversary. In the 1960s, the complex underwent further development and numerous exhibitions and educational activities were launched. In 1974, the New Zoo in Pozna≈Ñ, located near Lake Malta and covering 120,6 hectares, was opened and in 1978 the Old Zoo was entered on the register of objects of cultural heritage. In 1985, the zoo's breeding program had its first major success as the first gibbon named Jurand was born in a Polish zoo.Wydarzenia w Poznaniu w 1985 roku. Czƒô≈õƒá trzecia, w: Kronika Miasta Poznania, nr 1/1987, s.130, ISSN 0137-3552 In 2008, the Elephants' Pavilion was constructed. It is the biggest such pavilion in Poland and one of the most modern buildings of this kind in Europe. Since 10 January 2016, El≈ºbieta Zgrabczy≈Ñska has been serving as the director of the Pozna≈Ñ Zoological Garden. In the same year, a fox sanctuary was opened within the zoo's area. It shelters and protects foxes that have been rescued from animal farms. In the years 2015-2016 the building of the aviary was renovated and since 2017 visitors can see new exhibitions of red-handed tamarins and cotton-top tamarins.

She has had solo exhibitions in Canada, Barcelona, Berlin, Boston, France, London, and New York and had a book, Flora, published by Nazraeli Press. She was named as one of the UK's 50 most significant contemporary photographers in an issue of Portfolio Magazine. Some of her well appreciated series of photographs are \\"Sustenance\\" (2003), \\"Flora\\" on flowers \\"as props for the subjects who are her female friends\\", \\"Falling\\" (2005) of the sky, and \\"Cosmoses\\" (2005‚Äì07) comprising pictures of flowers shown like stars falling from the sky. Biography Madahar was born in 1966 in London. She has a Hindu background, and is a British national. In her initial years she evinced keen interest in photography. Though discouraged by her parents, she pursued her passion for photography by attending painting and drawing classes in the evenings. Her first degree was in mathematics, a tradition in her family. Her further education started with a degree from the Winchester School of Art in 1999 with specific interest in videography. She then continued her studies at the University of Southampton in England and received a BA Honors degree in Fine Art. In 2003, she graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and Tufts University, Boston with a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in Studio Art; this study was facilitated by a scholarship. The subject matter of her MFA degree related to a series titled \\"Sustenance\\" which brought her accolades. In this series, Madahar has six pictures of birds taken in identical composition of a red-and-clear plastic bird feeder atop a tree which attracts a number of birds. The photographs were taken in a complicated technique, from a camouflaged location, over a period of 18 months by using a large format camera. Another set of photographs of the sky is titled \\"Solstice,\\" taken on 21 June, the longest day of the year, and exhibited in June 2007. Madahar has presented her photographs in solo exhibitions at Les Rencontres-Arles Photography Festival in France in 2004, at the Institute of International Visual Arts (InIVA), London in 2005, at Purdy Hicks Gallery, London, at Howard Yezerski Gallery, Boston, Danforth Museum of Art, Massachusetts during 2006, and in 2007 at the Oakville Galleries,Ontario, Canada. In 2008, having received a 2008‚Äì09 Bradford Fellowship in Photography from the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, she presented solo exhibitions from October 2009 to February 2010. A monograph based on a series of photographic portraits titled \\"Flora\\", which comprise 17 photographs of her women friends, has been released by Nazraeli Press. The theme of \\"Flora\\" is the close link that exists in \\"nature, artifice and perception\\". These represent the style in vogue during 1930-1950s set to the present scenario. The photographs bring out \\"an extreme, stylized form of femininity alongside associations between fantasy and female beauty.\\" On \\"Flora\\", Madahar says \\"There has been no digital retouching of the images. With this series I felt that I needed to delineate my relationship to photographic ‚Äòtruth‚Äô and I chose to stay within the confines of what is feasible following a non-digital process. I wanted to see what regular, mature women look like and how skin, muscle and fat appears when restricting oneself to the benefits of hair and make-up products, the flattery of clothes, controlled studio lighting and the image manipulations, such as dodging and burning, that can be executed in an analogue darkroom.\\" Currently she is organizing exhibitions, projects on animation, self-portraiture, art and commercial photography, and a project related to her Hindu parentage.

Perhaps the most well-known Bruneian of Murut descent in his heyday, he was a member of the Brunei team that won the Malaysian Cup in 1999. Club career =Brunei= Fadlin started out with the Brunei team that played in the Malaysian leagues in 1997. Along with contemporaries Azmanuddin Gillen and Irwan Mohammad, the trio formed a youthful Brunei midfield which complimented the ageing local players and experienced imports. The team finished third in the 1998 Malaysia Premier League 1, their record highest position. After a lacklustre league campaign the following year, Brunei managed to top their group in the six-team group stage of the season-ending Malaysia Cup. Fadlin scored Brunei's first goal against Negri Sembilan in a 3‚Äì0 win at home in the first semifinal. After his team went through in a 4‚Äì3 aggregate win, Fadlin started the 1999 Malaysia Cup final held at Stadium Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur, against Sarawak in an all- Borneo matchup. He lifted the cup at the end of the game after two goals from Rosli Liman sealed a famous victory for Brunei. Brunei were immediately relegated the next year after the restriction of fielding import players by FAM and also the retirement of seven first-team players. Fadlin stayed with the Wasps in the Malaysian second tier for the next five seasons. =DPMM FC= At club level, Fadlin played for Prince Abdul Hakeem's club, AH United. Fadlin became top-scorer of the inaugural Proton B-League despite his team finishing in fourth place. Fadlin transferred to Brunei DPMM FC who had just left the B-League to replace Brunei in the Malaysia Premier League for the 2005-06 season. DPMM finished third and was promoted to the Malaysia Super League through the playoffs. Now playing as a striker, Fadlin served as an experienced backup to Shahrazen Said whose goals propelled DPMM to a respectable third place in the 2006‚Äì07 Malaysia Super League. By 2008, Fadlin was struggling to gain playing time due to a recurring knee injury. He was released in the 2008 close season. International career Fadlin played two games at the 1999 SEA Games held in his country Brunei, against Singapore and Indonesia. He appeared three times for the Wasps in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification, which included a 9‚Äì0 drubbing by Japan.

As the knifer reportedly shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" while stabbing the random victims, first reactions of the German and international media as well as the general public suspected an Islamist attack. On his arrest shortly after the attack, the perpetrator proved to be a mentally disturbed, unemployed carpenter with drug problems and no known ties to Islamist organizations. In August 2017 the Landgericht M√ºnchen II ruled the man to not be criminally liable of the crime and committed him to a closed psychiatric ward. The attack The attack occurred during the morning hours of 10 May 2016 at Grafing station in the town of Grafing in the Munich Metropolitan Region. A 56-year-old man was attacked by the perpetrator with a knife on board a Munich S-Bahn train; he later died in hospital. A further man was then attacked on the platform, then the knifer targeted two cyclists in front of the station, one of them a local newspaper deliveryman of 58 years who was seriously injured in the attack. According to eyewitnesses and confirmed by investigators, the perpetrator shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is great\\" in Arabic) and, in German, \\"Infidel, you must die now\\" during the attack. All victims were randomly chosen. The train driver and a security official were reported to have chased the man away from the station. Police officers responded at the crime scene on 5:04 a.m. and arrested a suspect only minutes later in front of the station. Perpetrator The attacker was described as a mentally disturbed, 27-year-old unemployed carpenter with no known ties to Islamist organizations. Local media outlets dubbed him as \\"Paul H.\\" The perpetrator was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after the attack, reported the Bremen daily Weser-Kurier. He was arrested in the hours following the attack. Though it was first reported that he had a migrant background, later reports indicated that he was from the German state of Hesse, and \\"does not have a migrant background\\". Aftermath =Investigation= A spokesperson at the Bavarian state criminal investigation office stated that she could not confirm that the attack was related to terrorism. The police said that the attack was done with \\"political motive,\\" based on \\"made statements\\". Ken Heidenreich, spokesperson of the prosecutor's office, said on the morning of 10 May that an \\"Islamistic background\\" was likely. Later that day, it was reported that the perpetrator had drug and mental problems and was treated two days earlier. The assumption that the attacker was an Islamist was ruled out, but a political motive is still being considered, though the attacker appeared to be confused during the interrogation. The perpetrator was not cooperating during first interrogation, but he later admitted to committing the attack. No links to terrorist networks were known. The police established a special commission, consisting of 80 officers. The perpetrator's cell phone and tablet computer were found and evaluated; in addition, CCTV recordings from the train and station were investigated. =Security measures= Service at the train station was temporarily closed to allow authorities to conduct their investigation. The attack caused the New York City Police Department to temporarily increase security on the New York City Subway system while investigators looked into possible connections to international militant organizations. Discussions made in the wake of the attack raised the possibility that bag checks at German train stations might have found the knife used in the attack and prevented it from happening, but German public opinion believes that such searches are an invasion of privacy. =Mental illness discussion= The attack was cited as one of a number of incidents in which mentally disturbed individuals launched violent attacks under the justification of Islamist ideas or slogans. Other examples include Man Haron Monis, the gunman in the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis; and Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the perpetrator of the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa. According to psychologists and psychiatrists who study radicalization, jihad propaganda and calls to kill infidels can push mentally disturbed individuals to act, even in the absence of direct or personal contact with radical Islamists. =Other reactions= German Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizi√®re condemned the attack as \\"cowardly and outrageous\\" on the day of the assault. A conspiracy theory, which began in Italy before spreading to Germany and then to the English-speaking world, purported that Paul H. was actually named Rafik Youssef and that his name had been changed as part of a cover-up. Rafik Yousef was an Islamist in Berlin who was shot dead by police in September 2015. The attack was compared to a knife attack at Hanover main station earlier that year on 26 February. The Italian newspaper La Repubblica compared this attack to the 2016 Wurzburg train attack, as did the BBC. Journalist Nabila Ramdani expressed outrage at what she termed the \\"purposeful\\" and \\"grossly manipulative\\" media use of the phrase Allahu Akbar, which, she claims, has become, a \\"trigger for publicity: the perfect tool for those seeking to spread as much discord as possible\\". Verdict On 17 August 2017, the Landgericht M√ºnchen II deemed the accused not criminally liable for his actions in Grafing. His mental illness, testified to by a psychiatrist in court, was acknowledged not only by the judge, but also by the prosecution as well as the accessory prosecution of several victims. The knifer was then sentenced to stay in a closed psychiatric ward for an undetermined time.

Abortion is permitted in circumstances where a woman's life is threatened by pregnancy. Legislation Abortion law in Saint Kitts and Nevis, as in numerous other Commonwealth member countries, is based on the British Offences against the Person Act 1861. Abortion is addressed in Part IX of Saint Kitts and Nevis's own Offences against the Person Act, in Sections 53 and 54, which state that any woman who unlawfully attempts to procure an abortion is guilty of felony and can be imprisoned for up to ten years with or without hard labour. A third party who administers an unlawful abortion is subject to the same penalty while the supplier of an instrument or substance with the knowledge that it will be used to cause an unlawful abortion is guilty of misdemeanour and faces a penalty of up to two years in prison. The Infant Life (Preservation) Act, which was adapted from the British Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, permits abortion at any stage of pregnancy so long as the procedure is performed \\"in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother\\". It states that a person who causes an abortion after 28 weeks of pregnancy is guilty of \\"child destruction\\", a felony, and is punishable with life imprisonment with or without hard labour. Saint Kitts and Nevis also follows precedents set in British abortion law, such as Rex v. Bourne (1938), in which the court ruled that an abortion performed on a teenage rape victim was lawful as it prevented harm to the victim's physical and mental health. Access to abortion services A three-year study of abortion practices in the northeast Caribbean, published in 2005, noted that women from Saint Kitts and Nevis who are seeking abortions often travel to nearby Caribbean countries in order to remain anonymous.

The 31st Infantry Battalion was at the forefront of this operation, assisted by two other battalions. After being assured by local barangay leaders that no MNLF forces had landed, the 31st Infantry Battalion began to withdraw its troops from the island on February 12, 1981, leaving its Headquarters Service Company along with battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Jacinto Sardual. The massacre Lt. Col. Sardual called on a Civilian Home Defense Forces commander Unad Masillam before his planned departure. Masillam and his men then accompanied Sardual back to the Headquarters Service Company's encampment, at which point Masillam asked Sardual to form up the company and stack up their weapons so that both sides could conduct a farewell ceremony. Sardual, who was a dental officer, complied and gave the order for his men to do so. The Moros surrounded the government troops and then let loose with automatic rifle fire. Responding soldiers who later discovered the bodies of their dead comrades reported finding spent .30 caliber shell casings and links at the Moros' firing positions, indicating the use of machine guns. Accounts vary regarding the number of dead Philippine Army troopers; reports indicate a body count of 119 and 124. Some of the bodies were found with defensive wounds on their arms inflicted by bladed weapons; many bodies were scorched, indicating that an attempt to burn them was made. Three of the company survived, all of them wounded. Retaliation The Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Navy bombed and shelled the island for nearly two months in support of Philippine Army search operations to capture the perpetrators, though 300 rebels may have evaded capture by escaping to Sabah, Malaysia. Juan Ponce Enrile, then Defense Minister, described the perpetrators as simply \\"armed men\\", probably smugglers or remnants of the Moro National Liberation Front. 3,000 Tausug civilians, including women and children, were killed in months of military shelling in 1982 and was tagged as a massacre.

She is the first transgender person elected to the Congress of the Philippines. She was named as one of the 100 Leading Global Thinkers of 2016 by US-based Foreign Policy magazine; one of \\"13 Inspiring Women of 2016\\" list by Time magazine. Biography Geraldine Roman, born in 1967, was the second of four children born into the family of politicians Herminia Roman and Antonino Roman, Jr. She spent her early childhood in Orani, Bataan. She was teased by her classmates but her father taught her to be confident. Roman attended the basic education unit of Ateneo de Manila University for her elementary and high school studies. For her collegiate studies, she attended the University of the Philippines Diliman. She managed to secure a scholarship to pursue journalism at the University of the Basque Country in Spain and attained two master's degrees. She worked in Spain as a senior editor for the Spanish News Agency before returning to the Philippines in 2012 to take care of her father, who was seriously ill by that time. Political career =Congress= During the 2016 Philippine elections, Roman ran under the Liberal Party banner for the position of 1st District Representative for Bataan in the House of Representatives. She competed against Hermosa mayor Danilo Malana of Aksyon Demokratiko and won with more than 62% of the total votes and became the first ever transgender congresswoman in the Congress of the Philippines. Roman succeeded the incumbent, her mother Hermina Roman, who had a limited term. She, along with other elected lawmakers (collectively known as \\"equality champs\\"), launched the passage of the anti-discrimination bill on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity (now known as the SOGIE Equality Bill) through a speech in the House of Representatives that garnered international support for LGBT rights in the Philippines. She also filed bills regarding eco-tourism, livelihood enhancements, agriculture advancements, health, and education, which were the advocacies of her family, and were focused on the first district of Bataan. She was named as one of the \\"13 Inspiring Women of 2016\\" by Time magazine in October 2016. She left the Liberal Party in May 2017 and transferred to PDP‚ÄìLaban, the current ruling political party of the Philippines, to hasten the House passage of the bills that she supported. In September 2017, the SOGIE Equality Bill passed unanimously in the House of Representatives, after 17 years of political limbo, with no lawmakers voting against it. In January 2018, Roman, along with the House Speaker, filed House Bill 6595 (the Civil Partnership Bill), which seeks to legalize civil unions, regardless of gender. In February, Roman became the first transgender official of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In August 2018, she filed the Regional Investment and Infrastructure Council Act, which sought to create special economic zones in Luzon. In September, Roman became the first committee chair of the newly created House Committee on Disaster Management. In October, she again pushed for the same-sex civil union bill, adding that the \\"sky will not fall\\" if the bill is passed. During the same month, she filed her certificate of candidacy for reelection in her district. In November 2018, during the first meeting of the House Committee on Disaster Management which she chairs, Roman prioritized the rehabilitation of the war-torn Islamic City of Marawi.

She cited the Spanish federal system as a possible reference for the Philippines' federal prospects. Habeas corpus Roman voted to approve a bill to reinstate the death penalty in the Philippines during its final reading on March 29, 2017, which met criticism online. She explained that she needed to compromise in order for her other advocacies and projects to push through.

Roman held a survey to gauge the views of her constituents in first district of Bataan and 85 percent of participants in a survey she conducted favored death penalty. Same-sex marriage Roman is the vice-chairperson of the Women And Gender Equality Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives. She supports same-sex civil unions for the Philippines, but said the first priority should be an anti-discrimination law, followed by a revision of the family code. She believes that at the present time, a marriage equality bill will not pass in Congress, due to the present status quo, which is why campaigning for it should be a top priority in the coming decades. In September 2017, the SOGIE Equality Bill passed in the House. In late 2017, Roman filed a civil union bill that caters to both heterosexual couples and non-heterosexual couples. The bill is backed by the majority of lawmakers in the House of Representatives, including the House Speaker.

She has filed bills for the protection and conservation of numerous tourist sites in the first district of Bataan. Education Roman supports higher education in the Philippines. She has filed the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Students (UNIFAST) bill in the House of Representatives. Additionally, she has filed a bill which seeks to mandate the government to open all of its books to the people via online library. Indigenous people's rights Roman has filed a bill seeking to increase the representation of indigenous peoples in the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, which is near her home province of Bataan. Agriculture and aquaculture Roman has filed bills on the sustainability of agriculture and aquaculture in the province of Bataan. She has also filed the re-allotment of public lands and urban lands for agricultural lands.

History On 7 February 1965, following the Attack on Camp Holloway, US President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered retaliatory airstrikes against North Vietnam and the deployment of HAWK missiles to South Vietnam to defend against any attacks by the Vietnam People's Air Force. The USMC 1st LAAM Battalion based on Okinawa was ordered to deploy to Da Nang. Arriving by C-130 on 8 April, by 9 April the HAWKs were operational at Da Nang Air Base. On 8 March 1965, the 9th Marine Regiment made an amphibious landing at Red Beach north of Da Nang while the 1st Battalion 3rd Marines landed at Da Nang AB marking the first deployment of US combat troops to South Vietnam. The 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (9th MEB) were tasked with defending Da Nang AB, while overall responsibility for defending the Da Nang area remained with the ARVN. On 20 July the ARVN approved the extension of the Marines' reconnaissance zone up to the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass. In August 1966 the Seebees began construction of a base area on Hill 724 near Highway One at the summit of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass and Battery A 1st LAAM Battalion moved to the new base from Da Nang AB. During the Tet Offensive, together with other attacks on US and ARVN facilities in the Da Nang area, at 01:40 on 30 January the Vietcong launched a mortar and rocket attack on Hill 724, wounding 3 Marines and damaging a HAWK missile launcher. At 09:15 Company G 2nd Battalion 7th Marines engaged a PAVN sapper squad just below the road summit, killing 3 and capturing 2, despite this the PAVN succeeded in blowing up several culverts temporarily closing the Pass. In July 1969 the 1st LAAM Battalion ceased operations and redeployed to the US. In late March 1970 the 3rd Battalion 1st Marines took over the defense of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass from the 26th Marine Regiment, stationing a reinforced platoon at Hill 724. On 1 August the Marines passed responsibility for the defense of the Pass to the South Vietnamese Regional Force.

Their distance from the power of the imperial government and a weak predecessor of Archbishop Baldwin had allowed the knights to acquire autonomy and rights supposedly under the law of custom, even though they were already vassals and fief holders of the Archbishop. In order to bring law and order to the land, a Landfrieden agreement was sworn in the late 1420s between Archbishop Balduin and the more powerful territorial lords. This measure was designed to curb private feuds and the operations of jungle law (Faustrecht), to counter the practice of disrupting trade by travelling merchants and the movement of goods through arbitrary tolls and illegal seizures, and to prevent the use of imprisonment and seizing of hostages in order to enforce a claim. In 1317 the Bacharach Landfriede was signed and, in 1333, the Lauterer Landfriede. In 1331 a \\"conduct agreement\\" was also signed between Bishop Baldwin and the Count of Sponheim to protect travelling merchants in the Hunsr√ºck-Nahe region and it obliged the lower regional nobility to comply with a new regulatory policy. Baldwin decided to reinforce his electoral sovereignty by building the counter-castles of Rauschenburg and Trutzeltz (also Baldeneltz), from where he controlled and prevented the knights from joining forces with one another. Baldwin's goal was not their destruction, but their recognition of the state's laws and sovereignty. In 1336/37 the feud was probably ended on his terms and atoned for. In the documents about this feud, appear the names of the brothers, Henry the Elder and Henry the Younger of Ehrenberg, John of Eltz, Conrad the Red of Schoneck, Rudolph, William, Winand and John, called Boos von Waldeck, and Hertwin Winningen. To get his opponents to take their obligations to the Electorate of Trier more seriously, the Lord of Eltz was made a hereditary count of the electoral castle of Trutzeltz and the Lord of Schoneck likewise at Rauschenburg. An agreement of atonement was concluded with John of Eltz in late 1337. He appears to have been the instigator and spokesman of the resistance to Archbishop Baldwin - which is probably why this dispute is called the \\"Eltz Feud\\". Primitive cannons known as pots-de-fer are known to have been used at the siege of Eltz Castle, which is the first recorded instance of artillery being used in Germany.

Designed by Antoine Groignard, she was the first ship to be built under a roof cover. She served in Suffren's campaign against the British in India during the American Revolutionary War, and was wrecked in 1783 near Pondicherry.  Career  Started in May 1772 on a design by Antoine Groignard, construction of Fendant proceeded slowly, due to shortages in timber in Rochefort. In November 1771, a permanent roof was erected over her stacks, as well as that of R√©fl√©chi, making the first ships to be completed in a covered dock. Fendant was commissioned in December 1776 under Captain Louis de Rigaud de Vaudreuil. She took part in the Battle of Ushant, where she sustained five killed and 27 wounded. Fendant served in the Anglo-French War, notably taking part in the Battle of Grenada. In July 1781, she fought in the Invasion of Minorca before being sent to the Indian Ocean in November to reinforce Suffren's squadron. Arrived there in March 1782, Fendant took part in the Battle of Cuddalore on 20 June 1783 as the flagship of Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier, Captain of the Fleet under Read-Admiral Suffren, with Armand de Saint-F√©lix as flag captain.

His only play that was met with some success is Jocko ou le Singe du Br√©sil, presented at the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville in Paris. He was son of Lieutenant-Colonel Fran√ßois-Louis, comte de Rochefort, and his wife, Catherine-Fran√ßoise le Bel de la Voreille.Dictionnaire universel de la noblesse de France, Jean Baptiste Pierre Jullien de Courcelles, vol. 4, 1821, pp 123-5 Rochefort wrote a book, M√©moires d'un vaudevilliste in which he recounts his adventures in La R√©union and the literary relationships he had with some writers of his time. In 1819 he was private secretary of Monsieur Millius, Governor of the Reunion Island. But lacking the necessary training, he returned to France in 1822 to marry Marie-Nicole Morel. He also authored a report Sur l'Ile de Bourbon et de Madagascar which was delivered to the Minister of the Navy and the original of which is in the O.M Archives in Aix- en-Provence. He had 4 children: Caroline, Palmyra, Emilia and the famous Henri. Caroline, good at painting, was supporting the family by making many copies for the State (sources: family archives). He died in the most abject poverty in a catholic congregation of the (filles de la Charit√© de Nevers). A very prolific author, he wrote under several pseudonyms: Armand de Rochefort, Edmond Rochefort, Rochefort. Rochefort-Lu√ßay was the father of the famous journalist and polemicist Henri Rochefort. Most biographers assign him the marquis title. However, the letters patent of the King and the Accounts Chamber have never been found. However, his grandfather, Gabriel Jean Dominique, was indeed baron Coulanges of the province of Berry (Lury-sur-Arnon parish) (deed of sale of Coulanges in 1763 to M. de Plusquellec). The Dictionnaire universel de la noblesse de France, by Jean Baptiste Pierre Jullien de Courcelles, gives Gabriel Jean Dominique de Rochefort the title of Marquis de Rochefort; his father, Pierre, was son of Dominique de Rochefort, comte de Lu√ßay et de Menetreau. The title of marquis was apparently bestowed in April 1619, with the family being thus 'comtes et marquis de Rochefort et de Pleuvaut, et de la Boulaye', as well as 'barons et comtes de Lu√ßay'. Gabriel Jean Dominique de Rochefort became head of the family when his uncle, Charles, died without issue.

The camp was close to the Turkish border, in Idlib province about west of Aleppo. Between 28 to 30 people were killed in the Kamuna refugee camp near Sarmada, northern Syria, initially reported to be by bombing from warplanes. Children were among the killed. The attack came during the truce negotiations between the warring factions. Witnesses state that the camp was struck twice, causing many tents to be set on fire. Events After the forces of Bashar al-Assad conducted an offensive on Aleppo in April 2016, an informal settlement, Ghita Al-Rahmeh, near the village of Al-Kamoneh, was assembled to host over 2,500 refugees (450 families) who fled from Aleppo towards the north. There were no military targets near the refugee camp, and it was clearly visible from the sky. At that time, the war planes flying over the province were typically those of the Syrian Armed Forces and the Russian Air Forces. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other United Nations officials condemned the attack and declared it a possible war crime. Ki-moon once again urged the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The UNCHR called the attack a \\"shocking disregard for civilian life\\" and described it as a \\"flagrant violation of international humanitarian and human rights law\\". Syrian military representatives stated that they had not targeted the camp. Russia stated that none of its aircraft had flown over the refugee camp, and its air-space monitoring data showed no flights by any aircraft over the camp. Russia's Defense Ministry officials stated that damage shown in photographs and video suggested the camp may have been hit by multiple launch rocket systems which were being used in the area by Al-Nusra. The OHCHR chief Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein said that the initial reports of the camp being hit by Syrian Air Force jets was not verified.

Research  Kleman‚Äôs research covers many domains, in materials science (liquid crystals, quasicrystals, magnetic systems, amorphous media), more recently in heliophysics (magnetic flux ropes). In all these domains his interests are concerned with the concept of defect, in the continuation of F.C. Frank and J. Friedel. He demonstrated the role of curved crystal defects in the topology of frustrated systems. He developed with J. Friedel the concepts of continuous defects. He showed that interplanetary magnetic flux ropes can be understood as extended singularities of the vector potential.

It was launched on March 15, 2005, by authorities of the Ahl Al- Bayt World Assembly. Its coverage includes issues concerning Shiite communities in Asia, Africa, Europe, America and other parts of the world. It gained a lot of following during the Arab spring therefore was banned in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain for casting news about regional protests.  History  In the year 2005, to tackle with the problem of mass media covering Shiite communities in an unfair way, it was the secretary General of the Ahl Al-Bayt World Assembly who recognized that in order to fight this one-sidedness there should be an exclusive website that can fully dedicate its time and energy to make sure all Shiite communities remain aware of the developments around them. To help, under-reported communities rise, in that year, the first form of a primary Shia news outlet came into existence under the name Shianews. In the summer of 2006, with an optimistic vision, the website received a professional management team to introduce it in a new interface which was more fitting and easy-to-use. At this point, more domains were also assigned for the site. In August 2007 a new phase was kicked off due to the amount of attention the website gained, making it one of the most famous Shiite news websites on the net. At this moment, Shianews changed both its domain and title to AhlolBayt News Agency and Abna24.com, managing to speak to a wider range of visitors from some Arab and western countries that had restrictions with ir domain. Subsequently, and by the inauguration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, ABNA became an official news agency operating in 20 (25 as of now) languages with full-time employees. Agenda People in ABNA are given the task to constantly observe the developments in Iraq, Syria, Nigeria and other areas where issues related to Shiite communities and often other minorities (including non-Shias) are unfolding. They report on them and let people share them via social media. They try to be equal in their approach. Awards ABNA is awarded many times during festivals in Iran. In 2012 ABNA won a prize for being the best online news agency from the 19th International Press Exhibition. Authorizations ABNA is licensed by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance (Iran) and is run by Sayyid Ali Reza Husseini as its managing director.

'View of Carrickbrachy in the Isle of Doagh as see looking the way of Traghbraga Bay drawn by Captain Sir Wm Smith in 1802'. The Isle of Doagh (Irish: Oile√°n na Dumhcha; also known in English as Doagh Isle or Doagh Island) is a small peninsula in the north of Inishowen on the north coast of County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland. It once was an island. Over time, the channel between Doagh and the mainland silted up and it became joined to the mainland. Nevertheless, the area continued to be referred as the Isle of Doagh or Doagh Island. The area comprises five townlands; Ballymacmoriarty, Carrickabraghy, Carrowreagh, Fegart and Lagacurry. Doagh Island is very near the village of Ballyliffin. The ruins of Carrickabraghy Castle stands at the north-western extremity of the peninsula.  History  = Neolithic period = The Isle of Doagh has one of the largest clusters of rock art sites in Ireland. The markings are around 4000‚Äì5000 years old. = Early medieval period = The Island was a stronghold of the Lords of Carraig Bhrachai who were part of the √ì Maolfabhail sept (anglicised McFall). There are numerous references to the inhabitants of the Isle of Doagh, in particular Carrickabraghy, in the Annals of the Four Masters. The earliest historical reference to Carrickabraghy is in 834, when Niall Caille led an army into Leinster. The Annals refer to one of his officers, Fearghas, son of Badhbhchadh, who was Lord of Carraig Bhrachai. According to the Annals, Fearghas was killed by Munster men during the campaign. = 17th and 18th centuries = Several townlands within the Isle of Doagh are mentioned in the 1665 Hearth money rolls: a tax levied on chimneys whose revenues were used to support the Royal Household. A total of 18 households paid the tax from \\"Lagacurry, Fegurt, Carickbracky, Carowreagh, and Ballym'Murty\\", of which 11 households carried the name of \\"O'Dougherty\\". In the 1654 Civil Survey, these townlands are also referred to as the property of The 1st Earl of Donegall (who also held the subsidiary title Viscount Chichester). The survey provided some limited information about economic activities in the area, which were the cultivation of oats, barley, wheat and rye. There was also some salmon and seal fishing. Lord Donegall was also the main landlord in Carrickfergus and Belfast. = 19th century shipwrecks = The coastline around the Isle of Doagh is notoriously hazardous for shipping and fishing. Throughout the 19th century, there were a number of maritime accidents nearby: * On 24 November 1841, a schooner, the James Cook, struck some rocks near Glashedy Island and broke up. The master and nine crew drowned. * On the morning of 22 April 1847, seven fishermen from the Isle of Doagh were drowned. In relatively calm weather, their boat capsized while crossing the Bay of Strabega after it was hit by a sudden swell. The dead were Donald Doherty, owner of the boat, who left a wife and six children; Patrick Doherty, who left a wife and three children; James McLoughlin (or McLaughlin), a wife and four children; Patrick (Roe) Doherty, a wife and one child; William Doherty, a young unmarried man; Hugh McCool, who was unmarried; and John McLoughlin (or McLaughlin), a widow's son, and her only support. William Doherty, the eighth person on board, escaped by swimming ashore. * In March 1878, a large barque called the Danube ran aground on the Isle during a severe storm. It was sailing from Liverpool to New York. It lost its masts and began to drift aimlessly. Two coastguards from Malin Head put out in a small boat and reached the vessel. The rescue craft was hit by a huge wave, and one of the coastguards was drowned. Subsequently, a line was floated ashore by means of a barrel, and the crew, twelve in number, were hauled ashore safely. * In September 1847, a brig heading for Greenock ran around on the Isle of Doagh. = Poit√≠n production = During the 19th century, poit√≠n was illegally produced in the area. In April 1898, the Royal Irish Constabulary (R.I.C.) conducted a mass raid on homes on the Isle and found illegally distilled spirits in several locations. Prosecutions of local inhabitants for illegal distillation were commonplace. For example, in August 1878, the home of a widow called Mary McGeoghegan, from Maheranoll, Isle of Doagh, was raided by the R.I.C. The constabulary found a jar containing one gallon and a half of illicit spirits concealed in her potato garden at the rear of her house. Opposite her kitchen door, they found a still that had been used for illicit distillation. A month later, at the Malin Petty Sessions, she was fined ¬£6. = The Irish Famine = The potato blight and the subsequent famine devastated the Isle of Doagh. Despite the obvious hardship caused by the failure of the potato crop, landlords continued to evict tenants. In May 1848, the Weekly Vindicator Newspaper reported that a large contingent of police and bailiffs entered the Isle of Doagh and evicted between 20 and 30 families. Tenants had been previously confronted with a doubling of their rents. In June 1848, the Belfast Vindicator reported that in Feggart, Isle of Doagh 53 people had died of hunger. Moreover, the newspaper provided a list of the victims; James McLoughlin, his wife and three children; Owen McLoughlin, and his six children; \\"Widow\\" Diver, and her two sons; Patrick Doherty and his wife; \\"Widow\\" Doherty and her two children; Patrick James Doherty, his wife, and three children; \\"Widow: McCoal and five children; Charles McLoughlin, his wife, and three children; Neal Doherty, his wife, and four children; Patrick, Daniel, Nancy, and Catherine Doherty; William McRory, his wife and five children. = Rural unrest = The Land League, which campaigned for agrarian reform, was active on the Isle. In 1880, John Mooney, a process-server, was attacked by a large crowd while he was serving a writ for a debt. Mooney took refuge in the local school but was forced out and made to swear on his knees that he would never serve any writs again. Five local men were subsequently arrested and tried at Carndonagh Magistrates. However, the men were acquitted after Mooney, the school master and other witnesses refused to identify the men as assailants. = Second World War = In February 1941, a mine washed up on a local beach. It was detonated by Irish Army troops stationed at Fort Lenan. The explosion shook houses up to ten miles away.  Carrickabraghy Castle  At the extreme westward point of the Isle of Doagh is Carrickabraghy Castle, which is sometimes known as Doherty's Castle. The Castle stands on a large rock known as Friar's Rock. The castle was constructed in the late 16th century and it was last inhabited in 1665. The structure of the castle included an oval bawn and seven circular towers. The bawn and towers enclosed a keep. To the south of the keep stood a small tower which is believed to have belonged to a church. The walls of the castle are 3 ft 9 inches wide.  Doagh Famine Village  In Lagacurry, a collection of traditional Irish houses have been transformed into a folk museum. The museum illustrates community living from the mid-19th century times right up to the present day.  Glashedy Island  Glashedy Island Glashedy (Irish: Glais√©id√≠) is a rock island approximately 3 kilometres (2 mi) west of the Isle of Doagh. It is currently uninhabited. Its former name until the early 19th century was Seale Island. At various times, the Island has been used to farm sheep. The 1654 Civil Survey indicates that the Island was also used as a base for seal fishing.

The effort officially launched as \\"Landmark Columbus\\" in 2015 as a program of Heritage Fund, and began producing events in the community. The effort has been seen as a way to preserve the design legacy of the town without relying on traditional historic preservation ordinances. In 2016 it became a \\"Friends Organization\\" of Docomomo US and remains a partner of the Indiana Modern committee of Indiana Landmarks.

The organization is active in the community in various ways, including nominating the Irwin Conference Center for a Docomomo US National Citation of Merit in 2014 for the National Historic Landmark building designed by Eero Saarinen, which was restored through an adaptive reuse project by Cummins Columbus historians David Sechrest and Ricky Berkey have been involved with the organization from the beginning, helping to create projects around both the early and modern history of the community. =Getty Foundation Keeping it Modern Architectural Conservation Grant= Landmark Columbus received a 2019 Keeping it Modern Architectural Conservation Grant from the Getty Foundation for the iconic North Christian Church. With this grant, Landmark Columbus‚Äîtogether with Prudon & Partners, Reed-Hilderbrand, Bryony Roberts Studio, Enrique Ramirez, ICR-ICC and others‚Äîare developing a conservation management plan to provide the historical context and strategic guidance necessary for the church's long- term upkeep. =Friends of First Christian Church Architecture= Friends of First Christian Church Architecture (FFCCA) is a collaborative effort with a mission to \\"is to preserve the architecture and design elements of FCC, a National Historic Landmark designed by Eliel & Eero Saarinen in 1942.\\" The project was launched in January 2017 as a partnership with First Christian Church, Heritage Fund, Landmark Columbus, and Indiana Landmarks. The first project for FFCCA was to help save the sanctuary skylight, which leaked for years and caused damage. In August of 2018 FFCCA had raised enough resources from the congregation and throughout the community to have the skylight fully restored. Fundraising for the restoration of the skylight was a collaborative effort, and included contributions from the Church congregation, Kenny Glass, Inc., and the Columbus Area Visitors Center. =Columbus Conversations= Columbus Conversation is an annual symposium held to address a pressing need in the community related to Columbus' design heritage. The series began in 2014 and featured Theodore Prudon's keynote presentation \\"Modern Architecture as Heritage,\\" and included lectures by Marsh Davis, from Indiana Landmarks; Louis Joyner, a Columbus-based architect; Richard McCoy; and a conversation moderated by Harry McCawley. The 2015 Columbus Conversation featured a panel discussion by Jeff Baker, the last president of Preserve to Enjoy, Inc.; Tricia Gilson from the Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives; Flora Chou, board member of Docomomo US; and Theodore Prudon, board president of Docomomo US. This moderated discussion defined ways that Landmark Columbus could raise awareness about caring for the areas design heritage and begin growing a constituency that actively helps in the cause. =Mayors' Institute on City Design= In 2019 Landmark Columbus hosted six mayors from cities around the country for a Mayors' Institute on City Design (MICD) regional session in Columbus, Indiana. Each of the mayors brought to Columbus a pressing design challenge that its city is facing, and worked with a resource team of nationally-recognized design experts to find solutions to make their cities better places to live and work. MICD is a leadership initiative of the National Endowment of the Arts in partnership with the U.S. Conference of Mayors. MICD works to prepare mayors to be the chief urban designers of their cities and advocates for good design in their communities. The mayors of Bentonville, Arkansas; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Fairhope, Alabama; Gallatin, Tennessee; Salisbury, Maryland; and Sheboygan, Wisconsin, were in attendance for this regional session. The resource team, assembled by Landmark Columbus to help workshop the mayors‚Äô design challenges, is composed of designers, all leading experts in their fields and many of which who are participants in the 2019 Exhibit Columbus program. =Chaotic Tuesdays= A \\"Chaotic Tuesday\\" inside the Commons In celebration of Jean Tinguely's masterwork, Chaos 1, located inside the Commons, Landmark Columbus started \\"Chaotic Tuesdays\\" as a free community event during which everyone could see the kinetic artwork operate during the evening. The idea for the event came from the director of Museum Tinguely, Roland Wetzel, when he visited in 2014. The event happens on the fourth Tuesday of every month and has grown to be a partnership between many in the community and led by the Columbus Area Arts Council. Professors from Ivy Tech bring drawing materials for the community and provide lessons on how to draw the artwork, which Tinguely himself did many times; his drawings of Chaos 1 are in collections around the world. =Landscape architecture cleanups= 2015 North Christian Church Landscape Clean Up Landmark Columbus has organized a number of community efforts to help clean and maintain the landscape at North Christian Church, which was designed by Dan Kiley and is one of seven National Historic Landmarks in the city. Cleanups have addressed issues caused by storms and ongoing maintenance, including the dormant pruning of the many magnolias that surround the church. =Yearly bicycle rides= Landmark Columbus started a yearly bicycle tour in May that coincides with National Preservation Month and National Bike Month. * The 2015 \\"Olde Tyme Architectural Bicycle Ride\\" featured a tour of late 19th and early 20th century architecture and landscapes near downtown. * The 2016 \\"Mad Men Bike Ride\\" featured many works of modern architecture, including stops at North Christian Church and the Miller House and Garden. * The 2017 \\"Public Art Bike ride\\" featured a look at many of the public artworks around downtown. =Landmark Lego Challenge= In May 2016 Landmark Columbus held a first-of- its-kind competition that invited participants to build one of the seven National Historic Landmarks out of Lego bricks. This project was launched in partnership with the Indianapolis Museum of Art, kids commons, the Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives, and other organizations. =Docomomo US Tour Day= Various partners began participating in \\"Tour Day\\" starting in 2013 to draw regional interest in visiting Columbus and seeing the modern architecture. * In 2013, a tour was given of the Columbus Arts District and the Miller House and Gardens. * In 2014, Indiana Landmarks created the \\"Landmarks Experience: Columbus,\\" a day-long immersion with lectures and tours that included the Miller House. * In 2015, Landmark Columbus created the \\"Saarinen, Pei, and the Plaza that Connected Them\\" tour, which looked at the relationship between the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library Henry Moore's Large Arch, and First Christian Church. =Documentation and surveys= In 2013 and 14, all of the public art in Bartholomew County was surveyed, photographed, and placed in the database of the Public Art Archive. The list of public art in Bartholomew County, Indiana includes more than 100 artworks in a diverse group of places. Also at this time, all of the resources in the Columbus Arts District and all of the modern buildings were surveyed, photographed, and published in the database of CultureNOW. Other research projects have included investigations for public artworks that are now missing. =Ongoing series of talks= Landmark Columbus occasionally hosts experts of architecture, art, and community. *2016 **Michelangelo Sabatino **ArtPrize and Exhibit Columbus *2018 **Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin talking about never built projects in Columbus =Public art walking tours= With the rich history of public art throughout the community, walking tours are frequent. There is also a special walking tour every October in partnership with Reach Healthy Communities. Exhibit Columbus 2016 announcement event for Exhibit Columbus on the Library Plaza of the Bartholomew County Public Library Exhibit Columbus is the flagship program of Landmark Columbus Foundation, whose mission is to care for the design heritage of Columbus and inspire communities to invest in architecture, art, and design to improve people‚Äôs lives and make cities better places to live.

He may, in fact, be a figment of imagination of the 18th- century historian Alessandro Maria Calefati (see: Mazzeo 2008, p. 100) was the Archbishop of Bari from 1062 to at least 1066, and probably somewhat longer.Golb 1987, pp. 10‚Äì11 In 1066, he travelled to Constantinople where at some point he converted to Judaism.

In the year 1005 or 1006, Wecelinus converted, went to live with the Jews of Mainz, and even publicly polemicized against Christianity; one short tract, preserved by Alpert, enraged the Emperor enough to appoint his own court cleric to refute it.Golb 1987, pp. 4‚Äì5 Notably, only a few years later, in 1012, Henry II expelled all the Jews from the city of Mainz, albeit for a short time.Frassetto 2007, p. 31 Notes References * * Cesare Colafemmina (2005) \\"La conversione al giudaismo di Andrea, arcivescovo di Bari: una suggestione per Giovanni-Ovadiah da Oppido\\" in Giovanni-Ovadiah da Oppido, proselito, viaggiatore e musicista dell‚Äôet√† normanna. * Joshua Holo (2005) \\"Jewish communities and personalities within Ovadiah's chronicle\\", in Giovanni-Ovadiah da Oppido, proselito, viaggiatore e musicista dell'et√† normanna * google books preview * Norman Golb (1987) Jewish Proselytism ‚Äî A Phenomenon in the Religious History of Early Medieval Europe, 10th annual Rabbi Louis Feinberg memorial lecture in Judaic Studies, University of Cincinnati. * Norman Golb (2004) The Autograph Memoirs Of Obadiah The Proselyte Of Oppido Lucano, and The Epistle Of Barukh B.

Darnell, MN (Retd.), and Skipper Lieutenant William 'Bill' Soloman RNPS (Retd.), the latter in particular being mainly responsible for acquiring a substantial part of the collection now at the Maritime Museum.The History of the Museum, Lowestoft Maritime Museum website As the size of the collection increased, in 1968 the Borough Council granted the Society the lease of a period cottage in Sparrow‚Äôs Nest Park in Lowestoft to house a permanent Maritime Museum. Each room in the cottage was initially dedicated to various aspects of the fishing industry in addition to a special display on the Royal Naval Patrol Service, the headquarters of which for both World wars was located in the adjacent Sparrow‚Äôs Nest Park, named as HMS Europa.Michael Foley, Front-Line Suffolk (2007) ‚Äì Google Books As the collection continued to grow in size and scope, in 1977 the cottage was extended at the cost of ¬£10,000, which was raised through donations and fund- raising activities.

This extension was opened in 1978 by Prince Philip. In 2010 the museum gained a Heritage Lottery Fund grant which enabled a major overhaul of the displays through a new extension.

The disease may eventually kill the tree. In an event in the Eastern United States and Canada in the 1930s and 1940s, no causal agent was found, but the wood-boring beetle, the bronze birch borer, was implicated in the severe damage and death of the tree that often followed. In similar crown dieback occurrences in Europe several decades later, the pathogenic fungus Melanconium betulinum were found in association with affected trees, as well as Anisogramma virgultorum and Marssonina betulae. Description Birch dieback tends to attack trees that are under stress, such as from drought, through winter kill or exposure to phenoxy herbicides used to control broad- leafed weeds in cereal crops. First, the foliage becomes scant and develops chlorosis or the leaves at the tips of the shoots start to curl. Then the twigs become bare as new leaves fail to develop. Whole branches may die as well as parts of the crown, and lower parts of the tree may develop densely bunched foliage. The tree usually dies within three to five years of the development of symptoms. History Paper birch in Quebec A birch dieback event occurred in the eastern United States and Canada between about 1930 and 1950. Species affected included yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and gray birch (Betula populifolia) and several features were noted: the dieback was preceded by a reduction in growth rate, there was an east/west gradient, with eastern areas being more severely affected, and the trend was reversed in the 1950s. The bronze birch borer was found to attack and kill trees already weakened by the disease, and honey fungus (Armillaria spp.) invaded the root systems wreaking further damage. The disease was afterwards linked to a rise in temperature of 1 ¬∞C (2 ¬∞F) that occurred in eastern Canada at that time. This likely caused warmer soils with some tree rootlets dying, and trees under stress from other causes were the most likely to suffer. At its peak in 1951 in Maine, it was estimated that 67% of the birch trees in the state had been killed. Birch are shallow-rooted trees and other factors involved may have been soil heave and frost damage to rootlets in the absence of a winter snow cover on the ground, the above-ground symptoms of shoot dieback being due to failure of sufficient new rootlets to develop. No specific disease organisms were found. Birch dieback disease is very similar to \\"postlogging decadence\\" which primarily affects birches on recently logged sites. downy birch in Germany In Scotland in 2004, about 40% of young trees were affected by birch crown dieback. Silver birch (Betula pendula) was more affected than downy birch (Betula pubescens). Two pathogenic species of fungi associated with the dieback were identified, Anisogramma virgultorum and Marssonina betulae. Although both pathogens were present on both species of birch affected with dieback, A. virgultorum did not seem to be implicated in crown dieback on B. pendula. Overview Birch dieback is one of a number of emerging fungal diseases affecting various species of tree in Western Europe. In 2015, Stephen Cavers of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Scotland, said \\"There is a clear increase in the number of novel pests and pathogens affecting the trees and forests of Britain. Most likely accelerated by the combined effects of, among other things, globalised trade, a changing climate and the planting of exotic species, the checklist of known threats has recently described an exponential growth pattern.\\" He advocates improving the diversity of the gene pool, planting mixed stands of trees and better controlling the international trade in tree species.

In that regard, Berr√≠os-Negr√≥n intends his social pedestals to go beyond the body and agency of the artist, aspiring to condition the transformative potential of art by making environments that operate by themselves, without the direct intentionality of the artist. As such, Berr√≠os- Negr√≥n deploys these environments with the intention of facilitating a social experience that is often contemplative and participatory, one that displays affirmative intersections between artistic, curatorial, political, and scientific practices. Berr√≠os-Negr√≥n argues that these environments rely on objects of collective experience rather than on individual agency. He roots these experiences in the conceptual objects of the ‚Äúrelational circuit‚Äù by Paul Ryan,Ryan, P.

It was launched when the Saab 9-5 was released for the 1998 model year and had been part of the standard equipment on the Saab 9-3 and 9-5 since.  Details  SAHR is mounted at the top of a frame, inside the seat-back, which is designed to pivot at its mid point. In a rear-end impact, the occupant‚Äôs lower back is forced rearwards by inertia against the bottom portion of the seat-back. A mechanical linkage in the frame then forces the upper half, carrying the head restraint, upwards and forwards to catch the occupant‚Äôs head and help minimise the amount of whiplash movement. The Benefit of the SAHR's system is that the headrest doesn't require replacement once used, unlike BMW and Volvo's WHIPS systems. SAHR 2 was introduced for the 2003 model year standard on the Saab 9-3. SAHR 2 was designed for even faster activation in rear impacts at lower speeds. The head restraint is activated as soon as the lower back is pressed into the setback by the occupant‚Äôs inertia during a rear impact.  Statistics  In 2002 a study conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that investigated property damage insurance claims found that Saab's active head restraint design produced a 55 percent reduction in claim rates for women and a 31 percent reduction for men. This is when compared to traditional head restraints.

History  In 1332 the Archbishop of Trier, Baldwin of Luxembourg, built the Rauschenburg during the Eltz Feud. It acted as a counter castle designed to defeat his opponents, the joint tenants of the castles of Waldeck, Sch√∂neck and Ehrenburg who were rebelling against their vassal status. Later tenants of the castle, which was enfeoffed by the Archbishopric of Trier, was divided among several families, including the Sch√∂necks, von Eichs, Waldbott of Bassenheim and Boos of Waldeck).  Description  The castles comprises a pentagonal enceinte. Almost the entire site was surrounded by a second lower defensive wall. On the uphill side was a neck ditch cuts across the saddle and would have formed the first obstacle to any attack. The remains of the gateway and foundations of the bridge may still be seen there. In the inner bailey are the ruins of residential buildings. In the centre of the western part of the enceinte are the remains of a tower, perhaps the old bergfried. In addition, the site is accessed via two surviving gates. A third gate in the southeastern section of the outer wall was probably wall up in the Middle Ages.

Description and history The former Norumbega Carriage House stands southeast of Norumbega Castle (now the Norumbega Inn), and is accessed via either High Street (from a drive shared in part with Norumbega) or Marine Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, built out of fieldstone and frame construction finished in wooden shingles. Its main block is rectangular, with a cross-gabled roof, and a tall circular tower at its eastern corner. The bottom half of the tower is stone, while the upper part of frame, and it is topped by a conical roof. The main facade faces northwest, and has an off- center stone section rising to a wall dormer at the roof level. In its ground level is a large entry set in a segmented-arch opening, with an arched bay above. A square ell extends southwest from the main block, giving the building an L shape. The carriage house was built, along with the main house, in 1886 for Joseph Barker Stearns, a telecommunications magnate who made his fortune in developing and patenting the duplex telegraph. It was designed by New York City architect Arthur B. Jennings, whose credits in Maine also include the St. Lawrence Church in Portland.

History =Notable events= In the night of 16‚Äì17 December 1551 George Martinuzzi was assassinated within the castle walls by General Giovanni Battista Castaldo. On 9 May 1595 Aaron the Tyrant was imprisoned and later poisoned here. In 1601 the Italian architects Simone and Fulvio Genga were accused of political intrigue and assassinated in the castle's dungeons by General Basta. In 1680, Metropolitan Sava Brancoviƒá was imprisoned by Michael I Apafi in the castle's dungeons. Between 1658 and 1661 the fortress was damaged by Ottoman and Tatar attacks. In 1715 the castle was owned by Transylvania's Roman Catholic Church, functioning as episcopal summer residence. In 1792, while occupied by Ign√°c Batthy√°ny, the property caught fire and was later repaired. During Romania's communist rule, the castle continued to deteriorate, having been used as industrial storage, granary and as a meat processing plant. Northern parts of the structure collapsed in 1981. After the Romanian Revolution, the castle was abandoned and the ruins are facing imminent collapse. Mythology Oral tradition suggests that Castaldo assassinated Martinuzzi in an attempt to recover a stash of ancient coins, which the cardinal was rumoured to have acquired from local fisherman and hidden in the castle.

Thus the \\"symmetric double-well potential\\" served for many years as a model to illustrate the concept of instantons as a pseudo-classical configuration in a Euclideanised field theory.S. Coleman, The Whys of Subnuclear Physics, ed. A. Zichichi (Plenum Press, 1979), 805-916; S. Coleman, The Uses of Instantons, 1977 International School of Subnuclear Physics, Ettore Majorana. In the simpler quantum mechanical context this potential served as a model for the evaluation of Feynman path integrals. or the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation by various methods for the purpose of obtaining explicitly the energy eigenvalues. The \\"inverted symmetric double- well potential\\", on the other hand, served as a nontrivial potential in the Schr√∂dinger equation for the calculation of decay rates and the exploration of the large order behavior of asymptotic expansions. The third form of the quartic potential is that of a \\"perturbed simple harmonic oscillator\\" or ‚Ä≥pure anharmonic oscillator‚Ä≥ having a purely discrete energy spectrum. The fourth type of possible quartic potential is that of \\"asymmetric shape\\" of one of the first two named above. The double-well and other quartic potentials can be treated by a variety of methods‚Äîthe main methods being (a) a perturbation method (that of B. Dingle and H.J.W. M√ºller-Kirsten in this reference the perturbation method is developed for the cosine potential, i.e. the Mathieu equation; see Mathieu function.) which requires the imposition of boundary conditions, (b) the WKB method and (c) the path integral method.. All cases are treated in detail in the book of H.J.W. M√ºller-Kirsten.Harald J.W. M√ºller- Kirsten, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Schr√∂dinger Equation and Path Integral, 2nd ed., (World Scientific, 2012, ) The large order behavior of asymptotic expansions of Mathieu functions and their eigenvalues (also called characteristic numbers) has been derived in a further paper of R.B. Dingle and H.J.W. M√ºller.R.B. Dingle and H.J.W. M√ºller, The Form of the Coefficients of the Late Terms in Asymptotic Expansions of the Characteristic Numbers of Mathieu and Spheroidal Wave Functions, Journal f√ºr die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 216 (1964) 123-133. See also: H.J.W. M√ºller-Kirsten, \`\`Perturbation Theory, Level Splitting and Large-Order Behavior¬¥¬¥, Fortschritte der Physik 34 (1986) 775-790. The symmetric double-well The main interest in the literature has (for reasons related to field theory) focused on the symmetric double-well (potential), and there on the quantum mechanical ground state. Since tunneling through the central hump of the potential is involved, the calculation of the eigenenergies of the Schr√∂dinger equation for this potential is nontrivial. The case of the ground state is mediated by pseudoclassical configurations known as instanton and anti- instanton. In explicit form these are hyperbolic functions. As pseudoclassical configurations these naturally appear in semiclassical considerations‚Äîthe summation of (widely separated) instanton-anti-instanton pairs being known as the dilute gas approximation. The ground state eigenenergy finally obtained is an expression containing the exponential of the Euclidean action of the instanton. This is an expression containing the factor 1/\\\\hbar and is therefore described as a (classically) nonperturbative effect. The stability of the instanton configuration in the path integral theory of a scalar field theory with symmetric double-well self-interaction is investigated using the equation of small oscillations about the instanton. One finds that this equation is a P√∂schl-Teller equation (i.e. a second order differential equation like the Schr√∂dinger equation with P√∂schl-Teller potential) with nonnegative eigenvalues. The nonnegativity of the eigenvalues is indicative of the stability of the instanton. As stated above, the instanton is the pseudoparticle configuration defined on an infinite line of Euclidean time that communicates between the two wells of the potential and is responsible for the ground state of the system. The configurations correspondingly responsible for higher, i.e. excited, states are periodic instantons defined on a circle of Euclidean time which in explicit form are expressed in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions (the generalization of trigonometric functions). The evaluation of the path integral in these cases involves correspondingly elliptic integrals. The equation of small fluctuations about these periodic instantons is a Lam√© equation whose solutions are Lam√© functions. In cases of instability (as for the inverted double-well potential) this equation possesses negative eigenvalues indicative of this instability, i.e. decay. Application of the perturbation method of Dingle and M√ºller (applied originally to the Mathieu equation, i.e. a Schr√∂dinger equation with cosine potential) requires exploitation of parameter symmetries of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the quartic potential. One expands around one of the two minima of the potential. In addition this method requires matching of different branches of solutions in domains of overlap. The application of boundary conditions finally yields (as in the case of the periodic potential) the nonperturbative effect. In terms of parameters as in the Schr√∂dinger equation for the symmetric double-well potential in the following form : \\\\frac{d^2y(z)}{dz^2} + [E-V(z)]y(z) = 0, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; V(z) = -\\\\frac{1}{4}z^2h^4 + \\\\frac{1}{2}c^2z^4, \\\\;\\\\; c^2>0, h^4>0, the eigenvalues for q_0=1,3,5,... are found to be (see book of M√ºller-Kirsten, formula (18.175b), p. 425) : E_{\\\\pm}(q_0,h^2) = -\\\\frac{h^8}{2^5c^2} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}q_0h^2 -\\\\frac{c^2(3q_0^2+1)}{2h^4} - \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}c^4q_0}{8h^{10}}(17q_0^2+19) +O(\\\\frac{1}{h^{16}}) : \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mp \\\\frac{2^{q_0+1}h^2(h^6/2c^2)^{q_0/2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}2^{q_0/4}[(q_0-1)/2]!}e^{-h^6/6\\\\sqrt{2}c^2}. Clearly these eigenvalues are asymptotically (h^2\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty) degenerate as expected from the harmonic part of the potential. Observe that terms of the perturbative part of the result are alternately even or odd in q_0 and h^2 (as in corresponding results for Mathieu functions, Lam√© functions, prolate spheroidal wave functions, oblate spheroidal wave functions and others). In field theory contexts the above symmetric double-well potential is often written (\\\\phi being a scalar field) : V(\\\\phi) = \\\\frac{m^4}{2g^2}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{g^2\\\\phi^2}{m^2}\\\\right)^2, and the instanton is the solution \\\\phi_c(\\\\tau) of the Newton-like equation : \\\\frac{d^2\\\\phi}{d\\\\tau^2} = V'(\\\\phi), \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\phi}{d\\\\tau}\\\\right)^2- V(\\\\phi) = -E_{cl} = 0 (\\\\tau being the Euclidean time), i.e : \\\\phi_c(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{m}{g}\\\\tanh \\\\left[m(\\\\tau-\\\\tau_0)\\\\right]. The equation of small fluctuations \\\\eta about \\\\phi_c, \\\\phi = \\\\phi_c + \\\\eta, is the P√∂schl-Teller equation (see P√∂schl-Teller potential) : \\\\left[-\\\\frac{d^2}{d\\\\tau^2} + V(\\\\phi_c)\\\\right]\\\\eta_n(\\\\tau) = \\\\omega^2_n\\\\eta_n(\\\\tau), with : V(\\\\phi_c) = 4m^2 -\\\\frac{6m^2}{\\\\cosh^2 m(\\\\tau-\\\\tau_0)}. Since all eigenvalues \\\\omega^2_n are positive or zero, the instanton configuration is stable and there is no decay. In the more general case of E_{cl} eq 0 the classical solution is the periodic instanton : \\\\phi_c(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{kb(k)}{g} sn[b(k)(\\\\tau - \\\\tau_0)], \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; b(k) = m\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{1+k^2}\\\\right)^{1/2}, where k is the elliptic modulus of the periodic Jacobian elliptic function sn . The small fluctuation equation is in this general case a Lam√© equation. In the limit k=1, E_{cl}=0 the solution \\\\phi_c becomes the vacuum instanton solution, : \\\\phi_c = \\\\frac{m}{g} \\\\tanh [m(\\\\tau - \\\\tau_0)]. The inverted double-well potential Perturbation theory along with matching of solutions in domains of overlap and imposition of boundary conditions (different from those for the double-well) can again be used to obtain the eigenvalues of the Schr√∂dinger equation for this potential. In this case, however, one expands around the central trough of the potential. The results are therefore different from those above. In terms of parameters as in the Schr√∂dinger equation for the inverted double-well potential in the following form : \\\\frac{d^2y(z)}{dz^2} + [E - V(z)]y(z)=0, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; V(z) = \\\\frac{1}{4}h^4z^2 - \\\\frac{1}{2}c^2z^4, \\\\;\\\\; h^4>0,\\\\; c^2>0, the eigenvalues for q_0=1,3,5, ... are found to be (see book of M√ºller-Kirsten, formula (18.86), p. 503) :E = \\\\frac{1}{2}q_0h^2 - \\\\frac{3c^2}{4h^4}(q_0^2+1) - \\\\frac{q_0c^4}{h^{10}}(4q_0^2+29) + O(\\\\frac{1}{h^{16}}) \\\\+ i\\\\frac{2^{q_0}h^2(h^6/2c^2)^{q_0/2}}{(2\\\\pi)^{1/2}[(q_0-1)/2]!}e^{-h^6/6c^2}. The imaginary part of this expression agrees with the result of C.M. Bender and T.T. Wu (see their formula (3.36) and set \\\\hbar = 1, and in their notation q_0=2K+1, h^6/2c^2=\\\\epsilon). This result plays an important role in the discussion and investigation of the large order behavior of perturbation theory. The pure anharmonic oscillator In terms of parameters as in the Schr√∂dinger equation for the pure anharmonic oscillator in the following form : \\\\frac{d^2y(z)}{dz^2} + [E-V(z)]y(z) = 0, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; V(z) = \\\\frac{1}{4}h^4z^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}c^2z^4, \\\\;\\\\; h^4>0, \\\\; c^2>0, the eigenvalues for q=q_0=1,3,5, ... are found to be :E = \\\\frac{1}{2}qh^2 + \\\\frac{3c^2}{4h^4}(q^2+1)-\\\\frac{c^4}{h^{10}}q(4q^2+29) + O(\\\\frac{1}{h^{16}}). More terms can easily be calculated. Observe the coefficients of the expansion are alternately even or odd in q and h^2 , as in all other cases. This is an important aspect of the solutions of the differential equation for quartic potentials. General comments The above results for the double-well and the inverted double-well can also be obtained by the path integral method (there via periodic instantons, cf. instantons), and the WKB method, though with the use of elliptic integrals and the Stirling approximation of the gamma function, all of which make the calculation more difficult. The symmetry property of the perturbative part in changes q ‚Üí -q, h^2 ‚Üí -h^2 of the results can only be obtained in the derivation from the Schr√∂dinger equation which is therefore the better and correct way to obtain the result. This conclusion is supported by investigations of other second-order differential equations like the Mathieu equation and the Lam√© equation which exhibit similar properties in their eigenvalue equations. Moreover in each of these cases (double-well, inverted double-well, cosine potential) the equation of small fluctuations about the classical configuration is a Lam√© equation.

It is the result of the merger of several late 19th century and early 20th century local freethinkers associations throughout Switzerland into a national society, currently headquartered in Bern.  History  With the introduction of cantonal church taxes in the 1870s, anti- clericals began to organise themselves. Around 1870, a \\"freethinkers club\\" was founded in Z√ºrich. During the debate on the Z√ºrich church law in 1883, professor Friedrich Salomon V√∂gelin and city council member Kunz proposed to separate church and state. The Deutschschweizer Freidenker-Vereinigung (\\"German Swiss Freethinkers Association\\") was founded in 1908, merged with freethought groups in the Francophone region of Romandy and the Italian- speaking Canton of Ticino, and forged close ties to the freethought movement in Germany (see German Freethinkers League). In the beginning, the association grew rapidly; the First World War caused the growth to stagnate, however. During the Interwar Period, a new upswing followed until the Great Depression and Second World War brought new setbacks. In 1933, National Councillor Hans M√ºller launched an attack on the freethinkers as a movement that actively fought against the Christian faith, and would thereby threaten religious peace. The attack, in the form of a motion, was adopted as a bill by the National Council on 22 June 1933 with 70 against 47 votes, but subsequently defeated in the Federal Council. Important Swiss freethinkers were pedagogue Ernst Brauchlin, businessman Otto Kunz and writer Jakob Stebler; socialist intellectual Konrad Farner was connected to the association. In 2011, the Freethinkers Association of Switzerland had about 1800 members.  Freethinker Prize  On 9 October 2015, the Swiss Freethinkers awarded the Freethinker Prize of 10,000 Swiss francs for the first time. It was bestowed upon Ensaf Haidar, Raif Badawi and Waleed Abulkhair for their brave efforts for humanist and secular values in Saudi Arabia. The Freethinker Prize is financed via a bequest, and will be awarded every other year in the future.  Publications  = Magazines = * frei denken. (German, \\"free thinking.\\").

Its main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows set in rectangular openings, and the centered entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a Federal style semi-oval fan. An ell extends to the rear, and a second ell extends right (east) from that one, not quite reaching to the property's 19th-century barn. The interior of the house is arranged in an unusual variant of the center hall plan. It has a narrow central stair, and the hall does not extend to the back of the house. Instead, the stair is flanked by parlor and living room, with a large chamber extending across the back of the main block. It retains original Federal period woodwork that is relatively modest in style. The house was probably built in 1825, a date found on the staircase's newel post cap. The builder, John Dutton, was a local real estate speculator who purchased the land on which it stands in 1815. He sold it, with house, in 1832 to Ezekial Small. It is one of the few brick houses in the community, and the most intact of those from the 19th century.

The competition, run by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), consisted of six franchise teams playing in a Twenty20 format. Each team featured three or four players contracted to the England women's cricket team and three overseas international players. Three teams qualified from the league stage of the competition; the Southern Vipers went directly into the final, while the Loughborough Lightning and Western Storm met in a semi-final. The Southern Vipers became the first WCSL champions, defeating Western Storm by seven wickets in the final. Stafanie Taylor, a West Indian overseas player for the Western Storm, was named as player of the tournament, after she finished as both the leading run-scorer and leading wicket-taker in the competition. Competition format Six teams competed for the T20 title which took place between 30 July and 21 August 2016. The six teams played each other once in a round robin format; followed by a finals day at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. The team that finished top of the table during the group stage qualified directly for the final, while the teams in second and third qualified for a semi-final. Both the semi-final and the final were played on the same day at the same ground. This was a change in format from the original proposal, in which the top four team qualified for the semi-finals. During the group stage, teams scored two points for a win, but gained an additional bonus point if they scored at a run rate 1.25 or more times that of their opponent. Teams Each team named a squad of 15 players, which included three overseas players and three or four England team players. The remaining squad positions comprised England academy players and a selection of other English domestic cricketers. A number of changes were made to the squads; before they were even officially announced, the Lancashire Thunder had to find a replacement for Jess Jonassen, who withdrew due to injury. In June, a month and a half before the tournament started, two further overseas players withdrew from the tournament. Megan Schutt was unable to play for the Southern Vipers due to a knee injury, and was replaced in the team by the New Zealand international Morna Nielsen, while Sarah Coyte withdrew for personal reasons, and was replaced in the Lancashire Thunder side by Amy Satterthwaite. The Lancashire Thunder suffered further disruption in the weeks leading up to the competition, when Sarah Taylor, who was initially named as their captain, confirmed that she would not take part in the tournament while she took a break from cricket to deal with anxiety and panic attacks. Amy Satterthwaite was named as captain in her place. Another late change was necessitated by a shoulder injury to Meg Lanning, with Lea Tahuhu replacing her in the Surrey Stars squad. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Home ground(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Coach ! scope=\\"col\\"  Captain ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  England players ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Overseas players - ! scope=\\"row\\" Lancashire Thunder Old Trafford, Manchester Stanley Park, Blackpool    Kate Cross Sarah Taylor Danielle Wyatt  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Loughborough Lightning Haslegrave Ground, Loughborough    Georgia Elwiss Rebecca Grundy Amy Jones Beth Langston  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Southern Vipers Ageas Bowl, Southampton    Charlotte Edwards Natasha Farrant Lydia Greenway  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Surrey Stars The Oval, London Woodbridge Road, Guildford    Tammy Beaumont Laura Marsh Natalie Sciver  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Western Storm County Ground, Taunton Nevil Road, Bristol    Heather Knight Anya Shrubsole Fran Wilson  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Yorkshire Diamonds Headingley, Leeds    Katherine Brunt Jenny Gunn Danielle Hazell Lauren Winfield  }  Tournament summary =League stage= During the group stage, alt=Nat Sciver batting The tournament began on 30 July at Headingley in Leeds, where the Loughborough Lightning faced the Yorkshire Diamonds. The Lightning batted first and scored 128 for nine, led by 52 runs from their New Zealand international, Sophie Devine. The Diamonds began their response well, and their captain, Lauren Winfield scored 23 runs from just 13 balls before she was run out. There was some controversy regarding the dismissal; Winfield felt that she had been impeded by the bowler, but the umpires upheld the dismissal. Regular wickets and miserly bowling from the Lightning attack restricted Yorkshire's batsmen, and they were eventually all out for 85, giving the Lightning a 43-run victory. The following day saw two low-scoring matches; the Surrey Stars were restricted to 85 runs from their 20 overs by a economic Southern Vipers bowling attack. Nat Sciver managed to score 36 runs for the Stars late in the innings, but the Vipers scored 66 runs from their opening partnership, including 41 runs from 43 balls for Georgia Adams to help them towards their target. They won with six wickets and 28 balls to spare. In the other fixture that day, the Lancashire Thunder reached 65 for four, but then a spell of bowling from Heather Knight and Stafanie Taylor for the Western Storm saw the Thunder dismissed all out for 83 runs. Taylor finished with four wickets, while Knight took three. In their batting response, Knight and Taylor were again the best performers; Knight scored 23 and Taylor 14 as the Storm chased down the total with 27 balls remaining. The Lancashire Thunder took on the Loughborough Lightning in the fourth match of the tournament, and the two teams combined to score over 300 runs. Amy Satterthwaite scored a rapid 52 runs from 32 balls for the Thunder to help them reach 164 for eight. A combination of good bowling from the Thunder bowlers, and some poor run outs hindered the Lightning's batting. Sophie Ecclestone took three wickets with her spin bowling as the Lightning collapsed to 77 for eight. A partnership of 69 runs between Thea Brookes and Paige Scholfield gave Loughborough a chance at chasing down the total, but late wickets for Hayley Matthews saw Lancashire win by six runs. The next day, Yorkshire batted first against Surrey and scored 134 for five, largely due to runs from Hollie Armitage (43) and Lauren Winfield (29). Surrey's Alex Hartley was the pick of the bowlers, taking two wickets and restricting the Diamonds to 18 runs from her four overs. In their reply, Tammy Beaumont, Bryony Smith and Nat Sciver all made good starts to help their side chase down the total and give the Stars a six wicket victory with 11 balls remaining. Lancashire Thunder hosted the Southern Vipers in their third match of the tournament. The Vipers batted first and scored 132 for 4, helped by a score of 54 not out from Sara McGlashan. The Thunder lost Matthews from the fourth ball of their batting innings, but then recovered with a 57-run second wicket partnership between Satterthwaite and Emma Lamb. The pair were dismissed two overs apart, and Lancashire failed to score the runs they needed, falling 11 runs short of the Vipers' total. A fourth-wicket partnership of 83 runs between Amy Jones and Ellyse Perry rescued Loughborough from 31 for three against the Western Storm, and they posted 158 for eight. Storm's captain, Heather Knight, scored 74 runs in the chase, but received little batting support from her teammates. After Knight was run out, the Storm faltered to eventually lose the game by five runs. Western Storm were in action again two days later, when they hosted the Stars in Bristol. The Stars batted first and scored 161 for six, propelled by an innings of 90 not out from Nat Sciver. In their chase, Stafanie Taylor scored 74 not out, and Lizelle Lee got 53 to help the Storm to victory. In Southampton the next day, the Southern Vipers beat the Diamonds by 54 runs; Suzie Bates and Arran Brindle each scored 45 runs for the hosts, and Linsey Smith then took four wickets to help bowl the Diamonds out for 64. Only Beth Mooney reached double figures for the Diamonds. A strong bowling performance from Alex Hartley and Marizanne Kapp helped Surrey to limit Lancashire to 102 for nine in the next match, with the pair both bowling economically and taking five wickets between them. The Stars chased down the target with more than four overs remaining; Tammy Beaumont scored 45, and Bryony Smith made 30. Stafanie Taylor scored 78* for Western Storm in the penultimate round to help them reach the semi-final. In the penultimate round of matches, Dane van Niekerk made the highest score of the competition, 91 runs, to propel the Loughborough Lightning to 168 for 6, the highest team total of the tournament. During the Surrey Stars' response, van Niekerk was also one of three bowlers to take two wickets to help limit the Stars to 134 runs, and secure the Lightning a place at finals days. The Vipers travelled to Taunton unbeaten before their match against the Western Storm. Batting first, the Vipers reached 137 for 3; Suzie Bates scored 57 runs and Charlotte Edwards got 30. In their reply, the Western Storm lost Rachel Priest early, but two big partnership involving Stafanie Taylor, who scored 78 not out, helped them to victory with 13 balls remaining. The final match of the day pitted the two northern sides against each other in the women's 'Roses' match. Yorkshire batted first in Manchester and scored 166; Alex Blackwell got 59 runs, and a slow over-rate meant that Yorkshire received six additional runs before the final over. In Lancashire's chase, Danielle Hazell took four wickets, and Katherine Brunt took a hat-trick to bowl the Thunder out for 71 runs. That meant that Yorkshire and Lancashire had each won once during the tournament, and irrespective of results in the last round of group matches, neither could qualify for finals day; both the Southern Vipers and Western Storm would join the Loughborough Lightning. The last round of matches, featuring all three of the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four‚Äìwicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining. =Semi-final= Suzie Bates scored 52 runs to help the Southern Vipers to victory in the final. The first match of the women's finals day, the Western Storm won the toss and decided to bowl first against the Loughborough Lightning. The Lightning scored 21 runs from the first four overs, before Stafanie Taylor struck twice in the fifth over, dismissing both openers; van Niekerk for 14, and Georgia Elwiss for 6. A 58-run partnership between Ellyse Perry and Sophie Devine ensued, though neither scored that quickly. The scoring-rate slowed further after Devine's dismissal for 21 runs, but a late surge from Perry and Thea Brookes helped Loughborough reach 124 for seven. Taylor finished the innings with three wickets, while Shrubsole and Dibble were both relatively economical, both going for five-runs per over or less. Beginning their chase, the Storm lost Priest early, bowled by van Niekerk for four runs. Taylor and Knight then shared a 57-run partnership before van Niekerk took the wicket of Taylor for 34. Knight remained in place, reaching a half-century before being dismissed in the final over, with the scores level. Georgia Hennessy came in, and struck four runs from her only ball to secure the victory, and a place in the final, for the Western Storm. =Final= Played at Chelmsford after the semi-final, Vipers' captain Charlotte Edwards won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Western Storm opening batsmen, Stafanie Taylor and Rachel Priest started well, propelling the score to 71 without loss after ten overs. In the subsequent over, Arran Brindle dismissed Taylor for 35, and her miserly bowling helped to slow the Storm's scoring. Heather Knight and Priest got out soon after one another, scoring 6 and 57 respectively, before the Storm's middle-order batsmen; Fran Wilson (16*), Lizelle Lee (6), Sophie Luff (2) and Georgia Hennessy (9*), added a few more runs to bring their total to 140 from 20 overs. Brindle and Tash Farrant were the pick of the bowlers, both conceding less than five runs per over. In their response, the Vipers' openers put on 78 runs together in just under 10 overs, before Edwards was dismissed for 24, bowled by Jodie Dibble. Suzie Bates was run out by Fran Wilson soon after for 52 from 46 balls. Georgia Adams added 15 runs before she was also run out, by Anya Shrubsole. Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their target with seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the Vipers to six runs per over.

He was also secretary of the Kentucky Medical Association and editor of the Journal of the Kentucky Medical Association for more than thirty years. He served as president of the American Public Health Association in 1938, the Southern Medical Association in 1940 and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) in 1923. Every year since 1950, the ASTHO has presented the Arthur McCormack award to a distinguished North American public health official.  Family  Arthur McCormack was the only child of Joseph N. McCormack and Corinne Crenshaw McCormack. Born on a farm in Nelson County, Kentucky, he moved with his parents to Bowling Green, Kentucky in 1876. In December 1897, McCormack married Mary Moore Tyler of Christian County, Kentucky. Together, they had four children, three of whom died in childhood. After the couple divorced in 1924, McCormack married Jane Teare Dahlman, former director of the Bureau of Public Health Education with the Kentucky State Board of Health.  Education and medical practice  After attending public schools in Bowling Green, McCormack graduated from Ogden College in 1892. He spent one year at the University of Virginia before enrolling in the College of Physicians and Surgeons (now Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons). He graduated in 1896 with a degree in medicine and after serving a residency at Paterson Hospital in New Jersey, he returned home to Bowling Green in 1897. He then joined his father's medical practice. The two men later invited Lillian H. South to join the practice and from 1908 to 1912 the three physicians operated St Joseph's hospital, the first hospital in Warren County, Kentucky. McCormack ended his practice of medicine in 1912 as his other professional duties increased in responsibility.  Kentucky State Board of Health  Joseph McCormack, as secretary of the Kentucky State Board of Health (KSBH) in 1897, appointed his son Arthur as health officer of Warren County, Kentucky as well as chief sanitary inspector for the KSBH. In 1911 the KSBH changed Arthur's title to assistant secretary, which allowed him to be appointed simultaneously as director of the Kentucky program of the Rockefeller Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease. In November 1913, Arthur was elected secretary of the Kentucky State Board of Health upon the resignation of his father, Joseph McCormack. Arthur McCormack oversaw the early 20th century expansion of the Kentucky State Board of Health into what is today the Kentucky Department for Public Health. In 1914, when the United States Public Health Service began a nationwide program for rural sanitation, McCormack assisted in the development of Kentucky's first full-time county health department in Mason County, Kentucky. McCormack took a brief hiatus from his duties at KSBH when he served in Panama during World War I. Upon his return to Kentucky in 1919, he lobbied for the enactment of the 1920 legislation in the Kentucky General Assembly which provided appropriations for additional full-time county health departments. The Morris-Reynolds Physical Education Law mandated that all public schools in Kentucky would provide physical education for students and that the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in cooperation with the KSBH, would prepare an instruction manual. Other important legislation during the decade authorized the KSBH to create the Bureau of County Health Work, the Bureau of Trachoma and Prevention of Blindness, the Bureau of Public Health Education, the Bureau of Dental Health and the Bureau of Medical Registration. The Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, organized in 1922, authorized the KSBH to accept federal funding under the Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Act. Another of McCormack's special KSBH projects was the joint sponsorship with the University of Louisville (UL) for the UL School of Public Health in 1920. Arthur McCormack served as dean of the school which was absorbed into the UL School of Medicine in 1922. Recognizing the sparsity of physicians in eastern Kentucky, McCormack encouraged Mary Carson Breckinridge in the establishment of the Frontier Nursing Serviceby issuing her a special state license to practice midwifery and promising her \\"carte blanche\\" to carry out her plan. In 1934, the Reorganization Act of the Kentucky General Assembly created a State Department of Health to take over the administrative functions of the KSBH, but left the legislative functions intact with the State Board. Arthur McCormack was designated the Commissioner of Public Health, the title he held until his death in 1943.  Kentucky Medical Association  McCormack was elected editor of the Kentucky Medical Journal (now the Journal of the Kentucky Medical Association) with the December 1906 issue. In 1907, he was elected secretary of the Kentucky State Medical Association, (now the Kentucky Medical Association) (KMA). He held both of these positions until his death in 1943, serving the KMA for almost 37 years. He was elected by KMA members to be a delegate to the American Medical Association House of Delegates thirty times between 1908 and 1943. Recognizing that the effectiveness of public health measures depended upon the full cooperation of the medical profession, McCormack used the Kentucky Medical Journal to keep KMA members informed of advances in public health and pending legislation on topics of interest to the profession. Arthur McCormack considered the state board of health, with its authority to issue and revoke medical licenses, to be the \\"legalized executive department\\" of the KMA. He continued his father's practice of encouraging the affiliated county medical societies to support the county boards of health and to elect KMA members to the county boards of health. It was this fusion of organized medicine and public health that gave the KMA physicians control of health policy, medical licensure and health legislation in Kentucky for many decades.  National activities  McCormack was a member of many health related associations and served as president of several of them. He was elected president of the American Public Health Association for 1938, of the Southern Medical Association in 1940 and of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) in 1923.  Final years  McCormack died of a heart attack on August 7, 1943, at his home in Louisville, Kentucky. His ashes are interred at Fairview Cemetery in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The McCormack Family Papers are housed at the University of Louisville.

He also spent more than a decade illustrating children's books for Czechoslovakia's main publishing house Albatros and designed iconic film posters and book covers throughout the 1960s. Moreover, having passed through a significant Lettrism phase during the early 1960s, he left behind an impressive body of photographs, illustrations and graphic art for which he received the 1999 Vladim√≠r Boudn√≠k Award.Anon., \\"Jan Kub√≠ƒçek‚ÄîRetrospective\\", Prague Steps, Apr 24, 2014. Education From 1949 to 1953, under the tutelage of Prof. Jan Novak, Kub√≠ƒçek studied at the School of Applied Arts in Prague, where he graduated. From 1954 to 1957, under the tutelage of Prof. Franti≈°ek Tr√∂ster, Kub√≠ƒçek studied scenography at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. Jan Kub√≠ƒçek was a member of the Czech designers' group Hollar, contributed to exhibitions of Czech constructivism from the late 1960s, and concomitantly was involved with Klub Konkretistov. Role in Czech post-war art Ladislav Danƒõk of the Olomouc Museum of Art relates, \\"Jan Kub√≠ƒçek substantially influenced Czech post-war art several times. At the turn of the 1960s his paintings were a certain antipole to the \\"dark\\" tones of structural abstraction. Subsequently, from 1962 to 1966, he participated in the formation of the Czech form of the international lettrism movement. From 1967 Kub√≠ƒçek was one of the key figures of neo-constructivist tendencies, and he continued to develop his original geometric programme until the end of his life. Kub√≠ƒçek's photographic work, though seldom mentioned, is also significant. The characteristic features of the artist's works of lettrism and geometric abstraction are: the sense of order, the striking visual message, the absence of literary contents and a precise painting technique.\\"Danƒõk, L., Composition with an Arrow, Letters, and a Number, 1963, Olomouc Museum of Art, 1995. Kub√≠ƒçek was a step ahead even in the artistic circles of his day. Owing to prohibitive strictures of the totalitarian regime, his work only gradually became widely appreciated in recent decades. Writes Ji≈ô√≠ Machalick√Ω, \\"Not everyone will understand Kub√≠ƒçek‚Äôs way of thinking in the same way. It is not a mathematical game, but an exact solution to problems, combined with intuition, without which art is impossible. And if we look at his work as a whole, it possesses an immeasurable logic found with few other artists, as well as the ability to open up other alternatives. It was a natural part not only of Czech, but also of progressive European art, which continued to develop the legacy of pure abstraction and constructivist tendencies.\\"Machalick√Ω, J., Jan Kub√≠ƒçek: Journey into the Future (Litomy≈°l, Czech Republic: Galerie Miroslava Kub√≠ka, 2016). From an early fascination with visual aspects of the contemporary city, Kub√≠ƒçek developed an autonomous use of geometry in his work. Kub√≠ƒçek was one of the few Czech artists engaged in conceptual geometry. Since the 1960s his art is immersed in constructivist principles and tendencies. His masterpieces include, apart from paintings and prints, constructivist objects made of plastic and/or metal.

During the Soviet occupation of 1968, Kub√≠ƒçek took the advantage of the chaos at the border and transported his artworks without permission to a solo exhibition at Gallery Teufel in Koblenz.Official website, profile. \\"Owing to Prague Spring,\\" writes Julie Koch, \\"Kub√≠ƒçek was able to deepen his contacts with Western artists. His work has proven to be remarkably parallel to trends on the international scene. Like other principle figures of constructivist/concrete art, Kub√≠ƒçek is popular in Switzerland, Holland and particularly Germany.\\"Koch, J., \\"Jan Kub√≠ƒçek a jeho v√Ωpovƒõdi o z√°konech a syst√©mech\\", Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz, Apr 24, 2014. In 2016, Czech architect Zdenƒõk Fr√°nek fabricated an enormous steel version of a tiny Kub√≠ƒçek object, and the resultant work was installed as a memorial to Kub√≠ƒçek in his birthplace city of Kol√≠n. Objects Early in his career Kub√≠ƒçek realised that the third dimension would render his work more complex and complete. Perspex seemed to him the ideal material for this purpose. Moreover, the layering of sheets in space allowed the viewer to see through objects, and multiple layers accentuated colors, proferring tones distinct from those available through the conventional mixing of acrylic paints. \\"The essence of my geometric work is simplicity and comprehensiveness,\\" said Kub√≠ƒçek. ‚ÄúWhen I transform my sketches into artefacts made of wood, plastic and other materials, some elements of the construction will always remain hidden from the viewer's eye. Perspex, on the other hand, makes the construction transparent and legible, revealing details otherwise obfuscated by opaque materials.\\" Apart from a bevy of smaller metal artifacts, Kub√≠ƒçek designed a collection of rods and prisms, which were exhibited in the Gallery of V√°clav ≈†p√°la in 1969 as a radically minimalist installation. Artistic objects form a unique part of Kub√≠ƒçek‚Äôs work‚Äîthey are limited in number and distinct from his other work. Many objects originate from the mid to late 1960s and have never been exhibited nor publicly examined. Kub√≠ƒçek was aware of the possibilities offered by plastic design. Unfortunately, he was not prepared to make large plastic artifacts. Instead he designed them as experiments or samples. \\"Most ended up in German collections, some pieces are in the ownership of collectors and museums in our country, and three objects fell victim to one wild party in my old studio,\\" the artist confessed in an interview. Kub√≠ƒçek ultimately returned to his primary medium, painting, which he continued to develop and improve. His objects thus constitute a closed collection. Kub√≠ƒçek said, \\"Most objects remain sketches on paper, but they deserve placement in architecture. One could then retrospectively show at least some of my works from years past. They would disclose their spatial form and convey vital geometric and constructivist thoughts and values.\\"Zvelebilov√°, K., \\"Jan Kub√≠ƒçek‚ÄîObjekty\\", Galerie Kuzebauch (Prague), Jan 23, 2014.

Leclercq assumed the religious name of \\"Salomone\\" after he was admitted as a professed member of the De La Salle Brothers. Leclercq was killed in 1792 after he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new French government almost two weeks before the kingdom was dissolved. He was killed in the garden of a Carmelite convent around a fortnight after he had been arrested and imprisoned in Paris. His beatification received the approval of Pope Pius XI who beatified Leclercq and his 190 companions on 17 October 1926 while Pope Francis approved his canonization in 2016. A date for sanctification was fixed at a gathering of cardinals on 20 June 2016 and the canonization was celebrated on 16 October 2016. Life Baptismal record. Guillaume-Nicolas-Louis Leclercq was born in the Kingdom of France on 15 November 1745. He entered the novitiate with the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools ‚Äì or De La Salle Brothers ‚Äì on 25 March 1767 and assumed the religious name of \\"Salomone\\". He served as a teacher and later as the master of novices. Leclercq also was made procurator in 1777 of Mar√©ville and in 1778 made provincial. In 1790 during the French Revolution the institute was designated as being illegal due to the members who refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new French government following the toppling of King Louis XVI. He too refused to take the oath and despite being monitored penned letters to his relatives. His last letter was dated on 15 August 1792. It was around this time in 1791 he and the priest Clorivi√®m initiated plans to establish a new religious congregation ‚Äì it was never to materialize. Leclercq was arrested on 15 August 1792 and was imprisoned with priests and other religious at a Carmelite convent in Paris. Revolutionaries armed with swords killed them all on 2 September 1792 in the garden of the convent. Sainthood The process for Leclercq's sainthood commenced in Paris on 21 March 1901 in a diocesan process for himself and his fellow 190 compatriots killed at the same time as he. The process was tasked with collating biographical evidence on them and attesting to their being killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith); the process concluded on 5 February 1906. This occurred despite the fact that the formal introduction to the cause did not occur until it received the approval of Pope Benedict XV on 26 January 1916 in a move that labelled Leclercq as a Servant of God. The second process later was held and after it concluded received the full ratification of the Congregation of Rites in addition to the first process receiving ratification. This ensured that the cause could proceed to the next stage under the care of officials in Rome. His beatification received formal approval from Pope Pius XI on 1 October 1926; the pontiff beatified Leclercq and his 190 companions on 17 October 1926. Following this Leclercq's cause was disconnected from his compatriots and treated as a singular cause. The supposed miracle that would lead to his eventual sanctification was investigated in the diocese of its origin in Venezuela from 19 January 2011 to 29 September 2011 and was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for further investigation.

Built in 1846 for a Free Will Baptist congregation, it is notable for its \\"reverse plan\\" layout (with the pulpit at the rear), and its distinctive grain-painted interior. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Clough Meeting House is located in a lightly developed part of southern Lewiston, on the north side of South Lisbon Road, across the street from the Clough Cemetery. It is a modest vernacular single- story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. Its main facade has two symmetrically placed entrances, flanking a raised sash window, and the side elevations have three windows each. The entrances lead into separate vestibules, which are separated by the raised area housing the pulpit. From these entrance is gained to the main hall, which occupies the rest of the building. At the rear wall is a \\"singing stand\\" (functionally a choir loft), another raised platform framed by wood paneling. Most of the hall is taken up by bench pews, which are arrayed facing the front of the building. The pulpit is set in an alcove between the vestibules, which is finished with a plastered cove ceiling. Some elements of the interior have been painted to resemble finer wood grain finish, while others have been smoke painted, which also gives a grainy appearance. The meeting house was built in 1846 by Henry Garcelon, a local farmer. It is one of a small number of churches known in the state that was originally designed with the reverse plan layout in mind, a form preferred by the Free Will Baptists at that time. It is equally notable for the well-preserved interior painting; the smoke painting on the stairs leading to the front and rear platforms is unknown elsewhere in the state. The congregation's records, now preserved by the Androscoggin County Historical Society, document the specifications to which the church was built. Regular services were held at the meeting house until about 1917, after which it was sold to the Clough Cemetery Association, which now maintains the building.

The alliance was founded on March 12, 2016, with the goal of overthrowing the Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Background The alliance chose to declare their founding on March 12 to announce to the world their commitment to the struggle against the AKP government in Turkey. March 12, 2016, was the 45th anniversary of the 1971 Turkish military memorandum, the 21st anniversary of the Gazi Quarter riots, and the 12th anniversary of the 2004 al-Qamishli riots. All three of these events serve as reminders of the alliance's mission \\"to lead victoriously our struggle for the Revolution, democracy and socialism.\\" The alliance believes that Erdoƒüan's party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), seeks to implement a new leadership in Turkey, effectively restoring the dictatorship established on March 12, 1971. Five members of the alliance (TKP/ML, MLKP, TKEP/L, Devrimci Kararg√¢h, and MLSPB) are also members of the International Freedom Battalion, a small group of foreign fighters supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces in the Rojava conflict. Principles and Objectives The alliance calls for the destruction of the AKP and its public support along with it. It calls for all victims of the government's terror to organize to overthrow the ruling AKP party. The alliance stresses that the struggle for self-determination of minorities is of the utmost importance, for all peoples oppressed by the government: > If the struggle for Kurdish self-determination is broken, the AKP will start > to attack all other opposition forces in Turkey. Consequently, the future of > all progressive, revolutionary and working class forces in Turkey is > directly tied to the future of the Kurdish resistance. It is through this message that the alliance calls for the mobilization of a unified popular revolution in order to overthrow the current government. The alliance resists all forms of imperialism, fascism, racism, capitalism, and conservatism on its path to a revolution. They invite \\"our peoples, our workers, the oppressed, all cultures starting with the Alevis, the women, the youth to join the ranks of the Revolutionary United Movement and to struggle.\\" Member organizations The following organizations were in attendance at the joint press meeting announcing the alliance: *Communist Labour Party of Turkey/Leninist (TKEP/L) *Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist (TKP/ML) (later withdrew) *Devrimci Kararg√¢h (DK) *Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) *Maoist Communist Party (MKP) *Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Communist Party (MLKP) *People's Liberation Party-Front of Turkey/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Armed Propaganda Union (THKP-C/MLSPB) *Revolutionary Communard Party (DKP) * (Tƒ∞KB) The Coordination of Revolutionary Proletarians (PDK) has also announced that they have joined the alliance, while the Resurrection Movement (TDH) has expressed interest in joining. Activities Soon after its formation, the movement began conducting armed operations against the Turkish government. On May 6, 2016, HBDH attacked a Gendarmerie General Command base in Giresun Province in northeastern Turkey. According to news reports, a roadside bomb exploded, targeting a Gendarmerie vehicle. HDBH claimed responsibility for the attack on May 8, stating that three gendarmes died in the attack, as well as the Base Commander, who was the intended target. This was inconsistent with the Odatv release, which reported only 1 casualty. Since its initial attack, the Joint Command of the Peoples' United Revolutionary Movement has claimed responsibility for several more attacks in the region, primarily targeting Turkish soldiers or gendarmes. The tactics employed by the alliance are very similar to those used by the PKK. The most notable attack came on July 19, just 4 days after the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt. HBDH reported that they had killed 11 riot police in Trabzon Province at 08:30 that morning. The HBDH report is consistent in time and location to an attack reported by Doƒüan News Agency, in which \\"unknown assailants\\" fired on a police checkpoint. This report states that 3 officers were killed and 5 were injured, along with a civilian.

Constructed during the early 15th century, the well was used by travelers and supported a nearby monetary through alms. History According to the well's inscription it was built in 1414 as a local water source for nearby travelers and monks from the nearby monastery known as Monkswell House. Built from sandstone the well originally consisted of the main sandstone well with steps leading down to the spring and topped with a holy cross. This cross when described in 1893 was seen to be lost however a replacement cross was eventually added during the 20th century based on a description of the original. The well's lower section is inscribed with Latin text which reads \\"Qui non dat quod habet, d√¶mon infra videt (actually 'ridet'): 1414\\". In English this roughly translates as : \\"He who here does nought bestow, The Devil laughs at him below\\". This phrase implying that drinkers are expected to pay alms otherwise the devil below will laugh. The restored cross also displays Latin text: \\"Deus dedit, homo bibit\\" which translates to God gives and man drinks.\\" To improve accessibility an iron pump was added in 1835 to pump water from the spring below removing the need for travellers to descend into the chamber below. Over time the well fell into disuse due to the advent of home piping and the demolition of the nearby monastery Monkshouse. However, the well's historical significance was recognised and became a grade II listed structure in 1952. Today the well is non-functioning with its iron tap removed and access to the chamber below converted to a flower bed.

Built in 1897, it is a high quality local example of Colonial Revival architecture, and a fine example of a period graded school. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. It has been converted to residential use. Description and history The former Watkins School building is located in western Rutland, on the east side of Watkins Street between State and West Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, covered by a complex hip roof with flared eaves and exposed rafter ends. It rests on a stone foundation, and has marble trim elements. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the projecting left bay, recessed in an opening framed by pilasters and round pillars, with a corniced entablature above. The windows on the second level are set in round-arch openings, that above the entrance elongated and set in a recessed panel. Belt courses of marble separate the levels of the building. The school was built in 1897, during a period after the city's 1892 incorporation where several new schools were built. It was designed by the Boston, Massachusetts firm of Stickney and Austin, and is a high-quality and distinctive contribution to the city's architecture. At the time of its construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood was only partially developed, and Watkins Street had recently been laid out. It was used as a public school until about 1959, and as a private special needs school in the 1960s. The building lot was used as a school bus storage lot beginning in the 1970s, with an underground fuel tank and service pumps installed, and a service garage added later. These facilities have all since been removed, and the building now houses low-income residential units.

The primary purpose is sustainable exploitation of the forest, subject to various limits. These include a requirement to preserve at least 50% of the original forest, to preserve forest along watercourses and on steep slopes, and so on. More than 10% of the Amazon rainforest is protected by national forests or other types of conservation unit. Definition The concept of the National Forest originated with the 1934 Forest Code. It is an area with forest cover of predominantly native species and has the basic objective of the sustainable multiple use of forest resources and scientific research, with emphasis on methods for sustainable exploitation of native forests. The forest is publicly owned, and any private lands in its boundaries are expropriated when it is formed. Indigenous populations may remain in the forest. Public visits are allowed, and research is encouraged, subject to the rules set out by the responsible agency. The term \\"national forest\\" is replaced by the equivalent terms \\"state forest\\" and \\"municipal forest\\" when it is created by the lower administrative level. The responsible agency must prepare and publish a management plan for the forest. Conservation S√£o Francisco de Paula National Forest Under the Forest Code any new national forests must maintain at least 50% of the original forest coverage, although older forests may have as little as 20%. Properties in the south of Brazil in which the Paran√° pine (Araucaria angustifolia) occurs cannot be deforested. Areas with slopes between 24 and 45 degrees cannot be deforested, but lumber may be extracted without clearcutting. Forests along waterways and around springs, on topographical heights, on slopes of more than 45 degrees, in salt marshes, on the edge of plateaus and above may not be touched. The minimum amount of wild coverage must be preserved at each level of the property. Industries that use forest products are expected to invest in forests to meet their needs. Financial incentives envisioned in the Forest Code including tax exemptions on forest income and tax incentives for reforestation have not been implemented or have been substantially modified. The regulations prohibit trade in wildlife products and by-products including 14 plants species and 207 species of animal. These include the black caiman, manatee, jaguar, marsh deer, giant otter, macaw and giant anteater. However, enforcement has been hampered by lack of personnel, there is pressure from poor people who need the resources for survival, and tropical plants and animals fetch high prices in the international market. Amazonia Seven new national forests were created in the Amazon by presidential decree of Fernando Henrique Cardoso on 2 February 1998. According to the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA) this did not increase the protected area of the Amazon since the forests had previously been military areas protected from predatory exploitation, or the perimeter of the Caraj√°s Project, the mining area of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD). However, the decrees did let the government claim that 10% of the Amazon forests were protected. According to Paulo Beninc√° of IBAMA the chosen areas had high potential for logging and were close to major rivers to transport. The goal was to create of national forest, which would be sufficient to meet domestic and foreign demand for wood products. The Caraj√°s National Forest around the Caraj√°s project would ensure financial partnership with CVRD for environmental projects.

Geography  Trutzeltz stands just 230 metres north of Eltz Castle and 40 metres higher at an elevation of on the rising hillslopes. The very small castle site measures just 30 √ó 25 metres. The ruins consist mainly of the still over 10 metre-high remains of the tower house and other foundation walls.  History  The castle was built by the Archbishop of Trier, Baldwin during the Eltz Feud (1331-1336/1337) as a siege castle to invest Eltz Castle. The Eltz Feud arose in connexion with Baldwin's territorial policy. During his reign, Baldwin sought to extend the influence of Trier along the Moselle. He repeatedly came up against resistance from knights who had refused to recognise their vassal (tenant) status, and 21 of them - the lords of Eltz, Waldeck, Schoneck and Ehrenberg - agreed a formal defensive alliance. Baldwin attempted a direct assault on Eltz which failed. In response, he had the siege castle of Trutzeltz built, probably in 1331. The castle was also referred to as Baldeneltz, probably after the archbishop. The following year he also erected the Rauschenburg as a counter castle to the three other castles allied with Eltz. That Baldeneltz was probably built in a very short time to put the lords of Eltz under pressure, can be seen inter alia from the building material used: mostly small pieces of broken stone from the vicinity of the siege castle itself.Verbal report by castellan, Dieter Ritzenhofen, 26 January 2005 It was held together with a strong clay mortar, which however cannot withstand a Central European climate in the long run. For a siege castle this was not important, but it is remarkable in that light that the continued existence of the castle was contractually assured in a subsequent peace treaty.Ingeborg Scholz: Erzbischof Balduin von Luxemburg (1307-1354) als Bauherr von Landesburgen im Erzstift Trier. Lit Verlag, M√ºnster, 2004, p. 248. Eltz Castle was bombarded from the siege castle with rock catapults (trebuchets), but was not able to be captured. In the course of the fighting, Baldwin also used an early form of cannon, the pot-de-fer, which has been determined from archaeological finds at Eltz. The Lord of Eltz and the other warring knights finally had to agree to end hostilities in 1333. The feud was not officially ended, however, until 1336 by an \\"atonement\\" treaty (a S√ºhne). A certain John of Eltz continued the conflict. He had previously fought against Baldwin even before the Eltz Feud in the Kempenich Feud.Friedrich Wilhelm Emil Roth: Geschichte der Herren und Grafen zu Eltz, unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Linie vom Goldenen L√∂wen zu Eltz. Vol. 2. Mainz, 1890, pp. 210 ff. and was therefore not ready to enter into a peace treaty. Baldwin now displayed his negotiation skills and magnanimity in drawing his opponent onto his side: after Trutzeltz had been effectively \\"legitimised\\" by the peace treaty with the other knights and its survival secured by them, he transferred it in 1337 to John of von Eltz as a fief and made him a hereditary burgrave.Friedrich Wilhelm Emil Roth: Geschichte der Herren und Grafen zu Eltz, unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Linie vom Goldenen L√∂wen zu Eltz.

On 9 January 1354 King Charles IV enfeoffed Archbishop Baldwin of Trier with Eltz Castle for his loyal service against Emperor Henry VII. ::Citation: ::\\"Hitherto the lords of Eltz were vassals of the Empire. On 9 January 1354 King Charles IV, out of recognition for his loyal service against Emperor Henry VII, enfeoffed Archbishop Baldwin of Trier and his successors with the fortress at Eltz near M√ºnstermaifeld together with its estates and all goods that the commoners of Eltz had as fiefs from him and the Empire, so that the commoners of Eltz should have and receive all these goods in future from Trier. At the same time he said that after the receipt of this enfeoffment from Trier the oath to the Empire is null and void. With that the enfeoffment terms of Eltz were promised to Trier.\\"Friedrich Wilhelm Emil Roth: Geschichte der Herren und Grafen zu Eltz, unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Linie vom Goldenen L√∂wen zu Eltz.

This result qualified him for the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, but Hawkins decided not to compete in Moscow in order to focus on his preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Hawkins competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games held in Glasgow, Scotland, representing the host nation in the men's marathon. He finished ninth in a time of two hours 14 minutes and 15 seconds, 11 seconds slower than his personal best, but was the highest finishing British athlete in a race won by Australia's Michael Shelley. At the 2016 London Marathon, Hawkins finished 14th overall, and was the third British-qualified athlete to finish, in a personal best time of two hours 12 minutes and 57 seconds. This time was inside the qualifying time of two hours 14 minutes needed for the 2016 Summer Olympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but as he was outside of the top two British finishers he did not achieve automatic selection for the Great Britain team.

It has never been put into service as a jail and was kept vacant until it was repurposed into the Bybee Lakes Hope Center homeless shelter which opened in October 2020.  History  The Wapato Detention Facility was funded in 1996 by a bond measure defined by Multnomah County Commissioners in Resolution 96-122, and promoted by District Attorney Mike Schrunk and law enforcement as a response to Measure 11. The facility in St.Johns neighborhood built by the Hoffman Construction Company has sat empty since construction halted in 2003. In March 2017, a California based developer offered $10 million for the property. In November 2017 Multnomah County commissioners voted to sell Wapato to Kehoe Northwest Properties for $10.8 million. Later, Kehoe counter-offered $5 million which was accepted and it was sold to Kehoe for $5 million on April 2018. The proceeds from the sale of Wapato were then marked to be used to create permanent housing. As of April 17, 2019 the property is owned by developer Jordan Schnitzer and is estimated to have a value of $8.7 million. Budget limitations prevented the county from opening the facility and it has never housed an inmate, getting only incidental use such as for movie shoots. It has since become infamous, being featured by media such as CNN's Anderson Cooper.  Repurposing  The facility is located in the heavy industrial, aircraft landing zone overlay area. Previously land use regulations prevented its use as a homeless shelter. In 2015 a petition was created online to refit the facility to house the homeless and in August 2016 Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith also further supported the effort. After the sale of the jail to Jordan Schnitzer he also received offers to convert Wapato to a homeless shelter and rejected them because of \\"cost and distance from other public services\\". In April 2019, a proposal was made by Kay Toran, who has been the president of Oregon Volunteers of America since 1999, to create a residential treatment program at the facility for adults experiencing addiction and mental health problems. The proposal received support from Schnitzer who called it \\"fabulous\\". Before the proposal, Schnitzer had considered using the site as a warehouse for one of his businesses, Harsch Investment Properties. Toran says that if the plan does not receive funding support in the next few years it would likely not be doable. In October 2019, Schnitzer announced that the plans to convert the facility into a community wellness center to serve the local homeless population had fallen flat. He cited low funding for renovation and a lack of support from elected officials and homeless advocacy organizations in drawing this conclusion. As such, he said, the facility would likely be demolished by the end of 2019. = Bybee Lake Hope Center homeless shelter = In February 2020, Wapato jail was on track to be renovated into a 228-bed homeless facility with expected opening of September 2020. By then, $4 million in funds have been raised, which is enough to operate for two years without any structural changes. In May 2020, the building's owner signed a lease with Bybee Lakes Hope Center for this purpose. Wapato facility was dedicated as a homeless shelter on August 12, 2020 and it has been in operation since October 2nd 2020 with 80 beds, with plans to add approximately 400 beds in December for long term housing. Oregon state senators Lew Frederick, Betsy Johnson, Elizabeth Steiner Hayward and Porltand Police Union president Daryl Turner sit on the advisory board of Bybee Lake Hope Center. = Emergency temporary facility for COVID-19 patients = Local media outlets reported on March 19th 2020 that the facility owner Jordan Schnitzer and the Oregon Health Authority are in discussion about opening up the facility as a treatment center for COVID-19 Coronavirus patients who need in-patient care, but do not need ICU care. Schnitzer commented that he hoped to have the facility ready for this purpose by the end of March, 2020.

The Democratic Party candidate, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter won the state of Tennessee with 56% of the vote against Republican Party candidate, President Gerald Ford, carrying the state‚Äôs 10 electoral votes. Carter, a native Southerner from neighboring Georgia, carried Tennessee with a 13 point margin of victory against incumbent Ford. The Watergate scandal had severely damaged Ford's predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in 1974 as a result, and the Republican Party as a whole. The relatively unknown Carter campaigned as a Washington outsider free of the corruption of Watergate, and thus appealed to many voters in the country, including Tennessee. As was normal during this era, Carter carried Western Tennessee and Middle Tennessee, the most Democratic regions in the state, by landslide margins, which included the major cities of Memphis and Nashville, the state capital. Carter even made inroads in traditionally Republican East Tennessee, though Ford kept the region in his column with his wins in the major cities of Chattanooga and Knoxville. Carter even outperformed by 0.44% Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs 1964 result during that President‚Äôs national landslide.

This is Nishikant Kamat's last film as director before his death on 17 August 2020.Upon Release it was sleeper hit at Box office,later upon years it became cult classic.  Plot  A 10-year-old child, Rohan, is kidnapped from his hostel. Rohan is the only son of the Home Minister. The army and the CBI storm into action. CBI officer Nachiket Verma heads the case and gets restrain orders from all the other security agencies to make sure that the kidnappers don't panic and kill Rohan. Initially, the case is thought of mistaken identity wherein the kidnapper might have tried to kidnap the friend of Rohan, Cheeku who was also drugged while kidnapping. For a long time, there is silence from the kidnapper and everyone is left guessing as who it might be, and at the same time the investigation is kept extremely secret, so as to keep the kidnapper(s) from killing Rohan. Behind the scenes, the security agencies try to find the location of the kidnapper without raising any kind of suspicion. Rohan is actually kidnapped by Nirmal after being drugged by him. Rohan shows his anger towards Nirmal for kidnapping him. Nirmal shows Rohan a pre-recorded video of his friend Cheeku who is in a drugged state struggling with fear. Nirmal tells Rohan that Cheeku will be killed if he refuses to co-operate with him. Nirmal keeps traveling via public transport to evade his location. One day, Nirmal calls Cheeku's father to convey a message to the Home Minister that Rohan was abducted on purpose. His demand is that he wants his son, who was lost in an act of negligence by the government, to be found. It is then revealed that Nirmal had a happy family with his son, Apu (short for Apurva) after his wife left them. Apu died when a bridge collapsed on him on his way to school. Moved and depressed by his loss, Nirmal decided to seek revenge from the politicians and others responsible for the death of his son. The news becomes a hot item in the media. Towards the end, Nirmal travels back to his house in Mumbai with Rohan, and calls a TV news channel from there and demands all those who were involved in the bridge collapse, including the Home Minister, come to his house and also the news anchor to broadcast it to the people, threatening to kill Rohan and himself if they don't. He makes the bridge contractor, the Home Minister, whose name appears in the initial scenes of the movie as Gilani (stated in a newspaper headline), and the ruling party's money man , confess their corrupt activities on a live broadcast on TV. Rohan indicates he understands why Nirmal did what he did and Rohan and Nirmal hug before Rohan leaves with his father. Nirmal surrenders to the police and is later seen immersing the articles his son was wearing (and the remains of his son in a schoolbag) when he died, in sea while being under the custody of the police.

It stars Stephen Dorff as a hard-partying alcoholic with telekinetic powers who, after a life-changing event, resolves to follow a more heroic lifestyle. Screen Media Films released it in the US on December 11, 2015.  Plot  Lucille, a crippled man who is in a wheelchair from injuries sustained in the Gulf War, searches New Orleans for his friend Melvin so a documentary crew can follow Melvin. They find him passed out on the street. Melvin, an alcoholic and drug abuser, is in a downward spiral and spends most of his time partying with his friends. His estranged ex-wife, Doreen, has filed a restraining order against him and taken sole custody of their young son, Rex. Lucille wants Melvin to clean up and get sober, but Melvin only makes empty promises to eventually get his life together. Lucas, a science teacher at the local community college, performs regular tests on Melvin, who has telekinetic powers ‚Äì the ability to move objects with his mind. Lucas can not explain this except that Melvin has a slightly different brain structure than ordinary people. Melvin will not see a specialist despite Lucas' urging. Besides Lucas' tests, Melvin uses his powers to perform street shows for drug money. Lucille, however, blames the local drug dealer, Nathan, of being behind violence in the neighborhood and does not like him. This is echoed by Jimmy, a local cop. After a night of hard partying, Melvin's heart stops. When he wakes, the doctors tell him that he was clinically dead for several minutes. Changed by this experience, Melvin announces that he intends to become sober for the sake of Rex. Impressed, Jimmy requests that Melvin help clean up the neighborhood. After practicing his abilities, Melvin confronts Nathan's gang and threatens them. Nathan has Lucille shot in retaliation. After Lucille tells him to leave him alone, Melvin falls back into alcoholism and parties with a friend who was recently released from jail. After seeing Nathan sell drugs to children, Melvin goes sober again and reconciles with Lucille. Together, they resume his training, and Melvin unveils a new, sporty wheelchair he has created himself for Lucille. Nathan sends his men to kill Melvin and his friends, but Melvin protects them by stopping the bullets. After visiting Jimmy and telling him to ignore any calls he receives about Nathan, Melvin attacks Nathan and his gang, chasing them out of town. Afterward, Melvin approaches Doreen, hands her child support, and requests to see Rex. Although skeptical, Doreen agrees.

Release  Screen Media Films released American Hero on December 11, 2015.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that three of ten surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.5/10. Metacritic rated it 42/100 based on six reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it \\"has some amusing moments\\", but it has too much filler and \\"never quite decides what it wants to be\\". John Hazelton of Screen Daily called it \\"a likeable if lightweight indie dramedy\\" that substitutes filler for drama or character development. Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International called Melvin likeable, and Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called him unlikeable; both said that the film was a clich√©d comedy-drama with a minor twist. Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's \\"enticingly quirky sensibility\\", saying that it has both charm and heart due to strong performances by Dorff and Griffin. Aaron Hillis of The Village Voice called it \\"a flaccid bromantic comedy\\".

He played college football at the University of Notre Dame. Early years Smagala grew up in Chicago, Illinois and attended St. Laurence High School, where he practiced football, wrestling and track. The summer before his senior year, he attended a football camp held by the University of Notre Dame, where he tied the camp record for the fastest 40-yard dash. As a senior running back, he posted 140 carries for 900 rushing yards and received All- city honors. He also rushed for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns in a playoff game. College career Smagala accepted a football scholarship from the University of Notre Dame. Although he had never played the position before, he was converted into a cornerback because he was considered small for a running back. Even though head coach Lou Holtz tried to convince him to transfer to another school, as a sophomore he was the team's second fastest player (4.35 seconds in the 40-yard dash) behind wide receiver Tim Brown and became a three-year starter at right cornerback. As a junior, he was paired at cornerback with Todd Lyght. Because the school played one of the toughest schedules in the nation, he covered some of the best college wide receivers like Andre Rison, Michael Irvin, Brian Blades, Brett Perriman, Reggie Rembert and Greg McMurtry. His most famous play was a 64-yard interception return for a touchdown against the number 2 ranked University of Southern California in 1988. He also helped the team win a national championship and achieve a school-record 23-game winning streak. Professional career =Los Angeles Raiders= Smagala was selected by the Los Angeles Raiders in the fifth round (123rd overall) of the 1990 NFL Draft, but was immediately traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a sixth round (#158-James Williams), eighth round (#197-Arthur Jimerson), ninth round (#230-Leon Perry), tenth round (#259-Jim Szymanski) and an eleventh round (#304-Myron Jones) draft choice. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 23, 1990, he suffered a broken left forearm while helping force a fumble against the Washington Redskins and was placed on the injured reserve list. In that game, he also saw action at strong safety. He finished the season with 2 special teams tackles and one quarterback pressure. He was waived on August 26, 1991. On October 17, he was re-signed to replace first-year player Donald Smith. He appeared in 8 games, playing mainly on special teams and making 8 tackles. =Pittsburgh Steelers= On April 2, 1992, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Smagala as a Plan B free agent. He was placed on the injured reserve list with a knee injury on September 1st. He was released on August 22, 1993. Personal life After football, he worked for a Real Estate Development company.

He was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in July 1971, but served only a few months before dying in office. Early life Toms was born in Boulder, Western Australia, to Lucy (n√©e Kent) and John Pryor Toms. He moved to Perth during his childhood, attending Midland High School. Toms left school at the age of 15, initially working as a labourer and later as a carpenter and joiner. He married Winifred Ann Jenkinson in 1933, with whom he had three children. Toms was elected to the Bayswater Road Board in April 1944, and would serve on the council until May 1971, including as chairman from 1951 to 1965. He was also prominent in the Building Workers' Industrial Union, a forerunner of the CFMEU.John Mervin Toms ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 10 May 2016. Politics Toms entered parliament at the 1956 state election, easily winning the seat of Maylands. At the 1962 election, he transferred to the new seat of Bayswater. When Bayswater was abolished at the 1968 election, he switched seats for a second time, winning the newly created seat of Ascot. Toms was subsequently appointed deputy chairman of committees in the Legislative Assembly. Following Labor's victory at the 1971 election, Toms was elected to the speakership. His elevation meant that the government and opposition had equal numbers on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, so he made frequent use of his casting vote as speaker. During a sitting in October 1971, Toms collapsed and was rushed to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, where he died. Because his death reduced Labor to a minority government, the premier, John Tonkin, advised the governor, Sir Douglas Kendrew, to prorogue parliament until the necessary by-election had been held (which Labor won).

In addition to being the composers second work for these forces following the Concertst√ºck he had composed in 1913, it was also the composers last major orchestral work. Background The concerto was composed in 1930 by Somervell for violinist Adila Fachiri, the great-niece of violinist Joseph Joachim, who first performed the work in Edinburgh in 1932 supported by the Reid Orchestra under Mary Grierson, further performances, most notably featuring the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult followed in 1933. It would appear that this success led the composer to choose, unlike his earlier Highland Concerto, to have the work published by Boosey & Co. in 1933. Despite the initial success and publication, the work was not performed again after 1933 until Hyperion Records recorded it in 2004 as part of their \\"Romantic Violin Concerto\\" series with Anthony Marwood as the soloist paired with Martyn Brabbins and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.

He taught as a professor at Columbia University from 1929 until his retirement in 1965. Life and Career Wang was born in Huantai County, Shandong province. His father Wang Caiting (; 1877‚Äì1952) achieved the Jinshi degree, the highest level of the civil service examinations and was a county magistrate in Guangdong, where Chi-chen lived for several years. Chi-chen studied the Confucian classics at home, then entered the middle school affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing in 1913. Upon graduation he proceeded to the United States on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program scholarship. In 1922-1924 he studied at the University of Wisconsin and earned an A.B. in Economics. In 1924-1927 he attended Columbia University‚Äôs business and journalism schools and the Graduate Faculties of Political Science, Philosophy and Pure Science. Wang did not study for a higher degree perhaps because, as he later wrote, he was not a ‚Äúgood student‚Äù. He confessed he was more interested in pursuing girls (although back in Shandong he had a wife by arranged marriage who later bore him a son). While in the United States, he came in conflict with American missionaries and the values of what he called western \\"enterprise, pugnacity, and dead-in-earnestness\\". He argued that Chinese religion was non-sectarian and pragmatic, and that the \\"practical common sense of the Chinese\\" makes the task of saving \\"the Heathen Chinee\\" difficult, even more so by the \\"growing sense of nationalism\\" after the \\"farcical Treaty of Versailles\\". Wang joined the Columbia faculty in 1929 was also a research assistant at New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1928-1936. and was among the few Chinese scholars employed at American universities in 1928. He returned to China in 1929 and 1935 to visit his family, which then lived in Shandong. On his 1929 visit, the poet Xu Zhimo introduced him to Shen Congwen, a highly regarded novelist and short-story writer. Wang and Shen corresponded regularly in the following years. Wang was in the group that expanded the Columbia Asian studies faculty in the 1930s, in which Wang taught classical language and literature. Wm Theodore de Bary's history of the program notes that :As a liberated child of the Revolution and alienated from much of traditional culture, he tended to be somewhat cynical and less than inspiring as a lecturer. His forte was as a translator of modern literature, and though allergic to all talk of grammar, he would spend long hours in virtually tutorial sessions with those determined enough to benefit from his fine command of both Chinese and English. East Asian Studies at Columbia: The Early Years Wang expected his students to not only be competent in reading Chinese but fluent and idiomatic English, particularly if they were native speakers. One of his students, Burton Watson, who would become an eminent translator, recalled taking an advanced course with Wang in 1950 reading two essays from the Shiji in classical Chinese. He later wrote that he remembered Professor Wang's \\"frequent exasperated outbursts,'You mean you don't even know that character?\\" or 'What kind of English is that!'\\" Watson continued that the hours spent with him that year \\"left me with the conviction that in translating such texts, it is not enough merely to bring across the meaning of the Chinese; one must do so in a manner that reads like natural idiomatic English. This conviction has remained with me through the years and informed all my work as a translator of Chinese and Japanese.\\" Another Columbia student who went on to a successful academic career, Harriet Mills, remarked that Wang Chi-chen‚Äôs translations were what first interested her in Lu Xun. Wang resigned from her dissertation committee, however, leaving Mills with the impression that he feared he would be in danger of McCarthyite reprisals (Mills argued that Lu Xun sincerely supported the Communists, a controversial position during the Cold War).\\"On Translating Lu Xun‚Äôs Fiction,\\" Jon Eugene von Kowallis SOS 11.2 (2012), p. 198 Through his friend, C.T. Hsia, Wang began a correspondence with Chen Jo-hsi, a Taiwan author who was living in Vancouver. She had gone from Taiwan to live on the Chinese mainland during the Cultural Revolution and wrote stories frankly describing life there. After they met, Chen said they became \\"friends across the generation gap\\". Wang translated several of her stories and gave her advice that she used in revising her book, Execution of Mayor Yin (1978) Kao (1980) When he retired, Wang recommended that C.T. Hsia succeed him. Wang was married twice, first to Bliss Kao, and then to Yang Dalai, until his death in 2001.

It features hand carved horses carved from reclaimed Eastern White Pine. Shinkle began the process of carving the horses in 1988. It took some five years to complete enough horses to set up the carousel. Along with the horses, he carved two wheel-chair accessible chariots and a mermaid sculpture which blows bubbles- thus she has the name, Bubbles. In 1993, Lance purchased a 1947 Allan Herschell carousel to hold the horses. The panels on the mechanism were painted to reflect scenes of Falmouth and Cape Cod. The carousel debuted in July 1993 at the Barnstable County Fair. The next season, Shinkle set up the carousel in Mashpee Commons and operated it there for two years. Later, it stood on the Main Street of Hyannis, Massachusetts. for a summer. The carousel also operated in Grand Central Station for Christmas season. Picture of Carousel of Light taken on location at Mullen Hall School Shinkle moved to California in 1999 and brought the carousel with him because his father was ill and needed his care. It fell into disrepair. In 2013, Lance brought together a group of civil minded people who had previously formed a committee to help him with the carousel back in his early days. Thus, The Carousel of Light, Inc. was established as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. Founding board members of the Carousel of Light, Inc. include Troy B.G.Clarkson, President; Donald Terry, Vice-President; Richard Sherman, clerk-treasurer; James C Bowen, Past President. The mission of the board is to \\"bring joy to children of all ages by protecting, supporting, and preserving the Carousel of Light for generations to come.\\" The carousel was returned to Falmouth by the non-profit in February 2014. After an extensive renovation, In the summer of 2014, the Carousel of Light had its inaugural season located on the grounds of the Mullen-Hall School. Over 15,000 riders enjoyed the carousel that year. The Carousel of Light has continued at that location during the summer seasons since.

History  Sch√∂neck was built around 1200 by imperial ministerialis, Conrad of Boppard, as an imperial castle. His descendants called themselves the lords of Sch√∂neck and lived at the castle until they died out in 1508. The family had several lines, who lived jointly at the castle (making it a so-called Ganerbenburg). It was from Sch√∂neck that the district known as the Gallscheider Gericht was administered. In the Eltz Feud of 1331‚Äì1336, the castle was part of the protection and defence league of rebel knights against the Archbishop of Trier and Elector Baldwin of Luxembourg. The castle became an enfeoffment of the Electorate of Trier in 1354. In 1488 Sch√∂neck was occupied by troops of the Count Palatine during the so-called Beilstein War (Beilsteiner Krieg) and, later, returned to the Electorate for a short time. From 1508 onwards, the castle changed hands several times, but remained a Trier fief-castle. Between 1560 and 1646 Sch√∂neck became the fief of a side line of the lords of Eltz. Between 1646 and about 1677 Sch√∂neck belonged to the so-called S√∂tern fee tail, a foundation for the management of the estates of the von S√∂tern family. The mastermind of this arrangement was Archbishop Phillip Christopher of S√∂tern. After being enlarged with Baroque wings in the mid-17th century, Sch√∂neck became known as Schloss Sch√∂neck. In 1805 the site went into private hands. In the time that followed several new buildings were added. Between 1846 and 1848 a milk spa (Molkenkuranstalt) was operated there for a while. In 1912 the artist, Wilhelm Steinhausen, bought the site. Since 1922 it has been owned by a family foundation.  Description  Schloss Sch√∂neck now consists mainly of buildings from the 19th and 20th century. Its medieval elements include its division into an upper and lower baileys. Medieval structures include the cellars and supporting walls, towers and part of the enceinte. On the uphill side are the remains of a neck ditch.

While at Baylor, he performed the first successful cardiac \\"auto-transplant\\" procedure, in which he removed a patient's heart, took a tumor out of the heart, and reimplanted the heart into the patient. He conducted research on gene therapy and growth factor utilization in cardiac care, and he worked to enhance the care provided in academic managed care systems. He became the medical school dean and associate provost for health affairs at Dartmouth College in 1998. Baldwin was president and CEO of the Harvard Immune Disease Institute from 2005 to 2007. He became president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) in 2007. During Baldwin's presidency, the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine at the TTUHSC El Paso campus received its accreditation as a four-year medical school. He resigned as president in 2009, but he remained at Texas Tech as an advisor to the chancellor and as a tenured professor. In 1995, Baldwin was elected to a six-year term on the Harvard University Board of Overseers. He also served on the board of directors of the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation and he received a 2011 presidential appointment to the U.S. Defense Health Board. Baldwin died on April 3, 2016, following a swimming accident in San Diego, California.

There are multiple advantages to using this form of propagation, because this system actively encourages plant growth. Namely, there are lower contamination rates due to the lack of sugar in the growing medium, and more catering to plants that aren't able to be successfully multiplied by conventional means. Many plants have trouble being propagated to due physiological or morphological inhibitions that make root formation difficult from cuttings. And after the plantlet develops in vitro, then the ex-planting process can often be very stressful and result in plant death, which isn't a problem for pre-acclimated plantlets grown via photoautotrophic tissue culture (In this context, pre-acclimated refers to plantlets that have developed a cuticle and have been cultivated in an open air system as opposed to the closed system seen in typical operations).  History and Development of Photoautotrophic tissue culture  A light-dependent reaction was observed in that a decrease in the available CO2 was found after the light switch in sealed containers used in conventional tissue culture. This led to the idea that plants, even in vitro, are capable of actively producing sugars via photosynthesis and this idea was quickly tested and validated using potato and strawberry in 1988. = Pros and Cons of Photoautotrophic tissue culture = Major limitations inhibit the widespread adoption of this methodology. Namely, there is a more stringent environmental maintenance that needs to be practiced. Proper ventilation, temperature regulation, CO2 concentration, and avoiding contamination are some of the hardest hurdles to overcome if resources are limiting. Generally speaking, temperature and light are already going to be standards of control practiced in micropropagation. However, ventilation and CO2 concentration become a challenge, especially while trying to maintain sterile conditions (even though if there is no sugar in the growing medium, aseptic technique is still an essential practice that is required to avoid contamination). = Current use of the Technology = As of 2016 a number of genera have been found to be well-suited to this form of micro propagation. Many researchers have adopted aspects of this type of propagation for certain projects by integrating ventilated lids or altering light intensity and sugar content in media, but only select few genera have been fully employed in a micro propagation project using this technology. They include Gerbera, Dendrobium, Hypericum, Momordica, Myrtus, Canna, Billbergia, Neoregelia, Solanum, Capsicum, Dioscorea, Saccharum, Pfaffia, and Cocos. This list isn't truly comprehensive, and there are many more where this system has been employed. However these genera are subject to complete protocol establishment and have known sources in the scientific community. for the most part these systems are establishment for ease of germplasm exchange, increased production, or to test a new form of propagating a given genus. = Use of Gas-Permeable Membrane Discs and Forced Ventilation = By using permeable discs as lids, air diffusion within the culture vessel can be improved. This will in turn allow for increased carbon dioxide concentrations during 'day' periods and less water vapor in the container which encourages transpiration. These combined features have an overall effect of enhancing photosynthesis, increasing growth rate, and shortening production time. Using forced ventilation tubules within the culture vessels was developed after the idea of using the discs, as a way to ensure that uniform content of water vapor and carbon dioxide is within each individual container. This ensures uniform growth habit and less fringe effects.

Early life Born at Rostrevor House, County Down, on 2 November 1846, he was third of the nine children of Michael Law, senior partner of Law and Finlay's bank, Dublin, and afterwards director of the Bank of Ireland, by his wife Sarah Anne, daughter of Crofton FitzGerald. His eldest brother, Robert, lived on his Irish estates. His second brother, Michael, was an early member of the international courts in Egypt. Law went to schools at Brighton and St. Andrews, and thence to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was gazetted to the Royal Artillery in July 1868, and served in India. There he became known as a sportsman and a fine steeple-chaser, while his instinct for topography and linguistic aptitude in French, German, and Russian promised well for a military career. But, invalided home, he retired from the army for private reasons in October 1872, keeping his name on the reserve of Officers. Russia and London Going to Russia, he next started business there as an agent for agricultural machinery and, after mastering many difficulties, prospered until he was ruined by the conduct of his partners, against whom he brought legal proceedings. Thereupon he joined Messrs. Hubbard, the English firm of Russian merchants, and in their behalf visited every part of the Russian empire. His intimate knowledge of the country and the people was turned to account in a long series of magazine articles on Russian ambitions in Central Asia. From December 1880 to March 1881, and from August to September 1881, Law acted as consul at St. Petersburg. In 1883 he declined the offer of a post which the war office was asked by King Leopold II to fill in the Belgian service in Central Africa (see Stanley, Sir Henry Morton) and he accepted the managership of the Globe Telephone Company in London. That company was then fighting the United Telephone Company. Law pushed through a scheme of amalgamation in the interests of the shareholders in 1884, and thereby abolished his own post. Sudan Volunteering for duty in the war against the Mahdi in Sudan in 1885, he served with the commissariat and transport staff of the guards' brigade. He received the medal and clasp and the Khedive's Bronze Star, was mentioned in despatches, and promoted to the rank of major (June 1886). He was meanwhile recalled to England for work in the army intelligence department in connection with troubles with Russia over the Penjdeh incident on the Afghan frontier. After visiting Manchuria to develop the services of the Amur River Navigation Company, he was associated with Colonel E. J. Saunderson in the anti-home rule campaign of the Irish Loyal and Political Union. Of inventive mind, he patented a machine for setting up type at a distance by the transmission of electric impulses, and a flying machine, the precursor of the aeroplane. Diplomat In January 1888 Law was posted to St. Petersburg as commercial and financial attache for Russia, Persia, and the Asiatic provinces of Turkey. He rendered valuable service to the English ambassador, Sir Robert Morier. After visiting Persia in the course of 1888, he was attached next summer to Nasiruddin, Shah of Persia, on his visit to England. In 1890 he acted as British delegate for negotiation of a commercial treaty with Turkey. In 1892 he went to Greece to make an exhaustive inquiry into the financial situation there, his report appearing early in 1893. In March 1894 he was promoted to a commercial secretaryship in the diplomatic service. After a riding tour all through Asian parts of the Ottoman Empire he reported on railway development there in October 1895, and was the first to suggest British association with Germany in the Baghdad Railway and British control of the section from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf; that policy he advocated to the end of his life. In December 1896 Law was transferred as commercial secretary to Vienna with supervision of Austria- Hungary, Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Balkan States. In that capacity he, with Francis Elliot, British minister at Sofia, negotiated a commercial treaty with Bulgaria in the winter of 1896‚Äì7. He represented Great Britain at Constantinople on the international committee for determining the indemnity payable by Greece after her war with Turkey in 1897. His influence helped to keep the amount within reasonable limits, and in the autumn he served at Athens on the international commission for the due payment of the indemnity and the regulation of Greek finance. When the international financial commission of Greek finance was founded in 1898, Law was unanimously elected president. He devised an ingenious system of consolidation of revenues, which rendered the international commission acceptable and useful to Greece, and he won a high place in the affections of the people throughout the country. While engaged on the business he was created a K.C.M.G. in May 1898, and given the rank of resident minister in the diplomatic service. He declined the Grand Cross of the Grecian Order of the Saviour and other foreign decorations. At the close of 1898 he went to Constantinople to represent British, Belgian, and Dutch bondholders on the council of the Ottoman debt. India In March 1900 Law went out to India as finance member of the government and took wide views of his responsibilities. He lost no time in completing the currency reform begun in 1893, setting aside the large profits from rupee coinage to form a gold standard reserve fund as a guarantee for stability of exchange. A great famine was afflicting the country when he took office, but a period of prosperity followed, and notwithstanding the cost of the many administrative improvements which Lord Curzon effected. Law was able to write off heavy arrears of land revenue and to make the first serious reduction of taxation for twenty years. The limit of income-tax exemption was raised from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1000 per annum, and the salt tax ‚Äì the burden of which upon the masses had been a subject of perennial criticism of government (see History of the British salt tax in India) ‚Äì was reduced from 2 Rupees 8 annas. (equivalent to 3s. 4d.) to Rs. 2 per maund. In the budget of 1905‚Äì6, promulgated after Law left office, but for the framing of which he was mainly responsible, the salt tax underwent a further reduction of 8 annas., and the district boards (roughly corresponding to the English county councils) received a material annual subvention. One of Law's useful reforms was to give the local governments a larger interest in the revenue and expenditure under their control ‚Äì a principle which was permanently adopted and extended later. As Lord Curzon testified, Law came into closer touch with the commercial community than any predecessor. To projects like the Tata iron and steel works at Sakchi, Bengal (see Jamsetji Tata), he gave earnest encouragement, and he eagerly advocated the new system of co-operative rural credit under government supervision initiated in 1904. Law, who was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Star of India,Queen's New Years Honours list, 1903 elevated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India.,Queen's Honours list, 1906 and resigned his membership of the council on 9 January 1905, some three months before the completion of his term. He dissented from the views of the viceroy in his controversy with Lord Kitchener over army administration, and on coming home served on the committee appointed by the secretary of state in May 1905 to make recommendations on the subject. This report advised changes, which led to Lord Curzon's resignation (East India Army Administration, 1905, Cd. 2718). To a despatch (22 Oct 1903) of Lord Curzon's government deprecating participation in the imperial preference policy, which Joseph Chamberlain had begun to advocate, Law appended a dissenting minute. Law's minute was used in party discussions in Great Britain and the colonies, and was cited with approval by Alfred Deakin, prime minister of Australia at the 1907 Imperial Conference (Official Report of Conf. 1907). After India On return home, Law became a vice-president of the Tariff Reform League, and actively championed its policy. Law represented Great Britain on the Cretan reform commission in January 1906, and on the committee which sat in Paris under the provisions of the Act of Algeciras (April 1906) to found the bank of Morocco. Appointed English censor of the bank, he paid thenceforth a fortnightly visit to Paris. Law, who was also connected with many financial enterprises in the City of London, died in Paris on 2 November 1908, his sixty-second birthday. He was buried at Athens on 21 Nov with the public and military honours due to a Grand Cross of the Order of the Saviour. A central street of Athens is named after him, and tablets to his memory are to be unveiled in the British chapel at Athens, and in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. In a chapter contributed to his Life, Mr. J. L. Garvin describes him as 'fearing no responsibility yet able to show himself ‚Ä¶ a safe and dexterous tactician, and audacious in instinct, prudent in method, and yet full of emotional strength, of passionate possibilities, and all manner of great-heartedness.' He married on 18 October 1893 Catherine only daughter of Nicholas Hatsopoulo, a prominent member of an old Byzantine family, who had long owned property in Attica, and had established themselves in Athens on the erection of the Greek kingdom. There were no children of the union.

Retrieved on 2016-06-29. Rosen's work often features anthropomorphic animals, archetypal heroines, or symbolic still-lives evoking the aesthetics of classical painting influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and referencing the Victorian Era. The transportive images captivate with a fascination of the natural world and ideals of beauty. Early life Born in New York in 1983 and raised in New Jersey, Claire Rosen is the eldest daughter of Dolly and Edward Rosen. Her mother is a culinary historian specializing in Victorian-era cake baking, and her father is a banking and intellectual property lawyer who interested Rosen in philosophy and the Socratic method from an early age. She has younger sisters whom she would drape in sheets and pose as Greek goddesses in the family's backyard when they were children. Her mother read to them from Grimm's Fairy Tales, Beatrix Potter, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and L. Frank Baum.Rogers, Monica Kass. \\"Claire Rosen\\", Communication Arts (magazine), September 2015. Retrieved on 2016-08-24. Rosen was also taken on frequent trips to the zoo, the circus, and the Museum of Natural History, which fostered a love of animals and taxidermy that has carried into her art.Rosenberg, David. \\"Do You Think This Wallpaper Goes With My Feathers?, Slate (magazine), 10 September 2014. Retrieved 2016-08-24. As a youth she was interested in art, but didn't express herself visually until college when she took her first photography class. Rosen attended Bard College at Simon's Rock, where she tried photography for the first time. She graduated with a liberal arts degree in 2003. She attended Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), where she learned technical skills and met Steve Aishman, a physicist-turned-photo instructor who became a mentor to Rosen. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Photography in 2006. Career =Rockport= Rosen moved to Maine after graduating from SCAD to complete a three-month internship with Joyce Tenneson at the Maine Media Workshops in Rockport. Following the internship, Rosen remained in Rockport to manage Tenneson's studio for two and a half years.Shoushany, Rudy. \\"Claire Rosen Exclusive Interview, Fashion and Fine Art Photographer\\", Rudy Shoushany Photography, October 2013. Retrieved 2016-07-07. It was there that Rosen began reading the works of Karl Jung, Freud, Joseph Campbell, and Bruno Bettelheim, which have subsequently impacted her work. She met Cig Harvey, who became a role model for Rosen. It was also during this time that Rosen created Fairy Tales and Other Stories, which is a series of self-portraits, and Dolls in the Attic. =New York= In 2009, Rosen moved back to New York and began working independently as a fine artist. She exhibited photos from her two series in juried shows. Fairy Tales received attention, and some images were licensed by magazines to run alongside articles. This marked the beginning of Rosen's crossover into commercial work, whereupon she began creating commissioned images for book covers, clothing designers, and other organizations. The vivid storytelling throughout Claire's work has enabled her to construct unique creative campaigns and installations for a wide range of commercial brands. From fashion labels to luxury hotels, book publishers to restaurants, her portfolio of commissioned images bridges the gap between fine art and commercial work. To date, Rosen has created commissioned work for National Geographic Magazine, FujiFilm US, Alex Randall Chandeliers, Neiman Marcus at Short Hills, Smithsonian Magazine, Random House Book, and a number of other businesses and magazines. =The Millbrook Collection= In 2010, Rosen photographed the vintage taxidermy in the collection of the Millbrook School in Dutchess County. She was selected as an artist in residence for the school. The collection contained 10,000 eggs, and approximately 500 taxidermied animals, birds, and reptiles, dating back to the early 20th century. The whole collection encompasses rare and endangered species from all over the world, covering an extraordinary period of time, with pieces dating back to the 1800s. In addition to the exotic, it is an excellent record of local wildlife and hosts examples of birds of prey found and preserved by students on campus. Beyond its impressive numbers, the Millbrook collection has a story to tell. For example, during the renovation of the science building, hundred of boxes and tins were uncovered beneath the floorboards. Each tin contained a bird's nest, wrapped carefully in newspaper from the 1920s and accompanied by a handwritten description of its contents. In addition, beautifully handwritten personal letters and journals from the original collectors were also discovered. This series documents the history of these pieces, photographing them with their original records when possible and isolating each piece on a black background. The artifacts are precious and beautiful in their own right and the photographs depicting them capture every facial expression and every mark from the passage of time and scar from the taxidermy procedure. By documenting these pieces in isolation, viewers will be able to appreciate the uniqueness of each piece. Together the photographs tell a story that weaves together history, biology the pursuit of knowledge and man's relationship to the natural world and will offer the wider world access to the wonders of this collection. The project will be published as a book in the near future. =Birds of a Feather= Birds of a Feather is Rosen's most widely seen photographic series. Rosen attributes the extremely positive response to the series to its beauty and sense of humor. The images feature portraits of exotic birds against coordinating wallpaper backgrounds. Birds of a Feather offers a new perspective on this tradition with portraits of live birds - from the common Parakeet to the exotic Hyacinth Macaw to the stoic Gyrfalcon - photographed against complementary historical and reproduction wallpaper and fabric from the Victorian Era. As the cult of colonization and exploration spread during the Victorian Era in Europe, it yielded brutal discovery and domination of faraway places, creatures and cultures. As these discoveries made their way back to Europe, aviary collection and display as well as a general fascination with the natural world and its exotic inhabitants rose in fashion. This series references that desire to possess the beautiful, wild and exotic, a possession that permanently changes the object of desire through its dislocation. The backgrounds in this series are selected to induce beauty, optical illusion and visual blending, the birds appear to belong when in reality it is a far cry from their natural environment. The birds mirror the careful, self-conscious poses of humans in an unexpected way. Posed, the birds anthropomorphize as we attribute human emotion and intent to their expressions. . Rosen explained of the series: > The Industrial Revolution and colonization created this disconnect from > nature in the Victorian Era and yielded an awareness of faraway places, > amazing creatures, and unfamiliar culture. This series references that > desire to possess the beautiful and exotic. Birds of a Feather was created in 2012. It includes common pets like parakeets, as well as exotics like the Hyacinth Macaw. Rosen discovered Bird Paradise, the \\"largest exotic bird superstore,\\" in New Jersey while trying to find a toucan to photograph for a commercial project, and was inspired to do a photoshoot with the birds in the store. She created sample images with her own pet parakeets. The photos were set up as portraits with traditional portrait lighting. Rosen brought sheets of wallpaper from Waterhouse Wallhangings to serve as backgrounds for the portraits. Friend Tom Pisano assisted with the photoshoot, handling the birds. =Fantastical Feasts= In 2014, Rosen created a photo series entitled Fantastical Feasts, which features animals eating around banquet tables in compositions that allude to Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Each photo in the series features a different species‚Äîincluding elephants, tapirs, sloths, miniature ponies, goats, mice, parakeets, honey bees, hedgehogs, etc.‚Äîeating the foods it prefers. Ron Haviv, New York photojournalist and owner of VII photo agency, assisted with the project. Rebecca Manson, New York expert retoucher, worked with Rosen on the images. The banquet is a historically defining characteristic of culture and conjures up vivid and colorful imagery, plentiful food and wine, exotic recipes, lavish presentations and glorious surroundings. The evolution of formal dining begins in the medieval era, where dining became a sign of social status. A change in society had emerged during the era of the Middles Ages when travel, prompted by the Crusades, led to a new and unprecedented interest in beautiful objects and elegant manners. This change extended to food preparation and presentation resulting in epic food arrangements with exotic colors and flavorings. Again, a boom in exploration and colonization in the Victorian Era yielded an interest in the exotic ‚Äúother‚Äù, a fascination which also extended to animals and the natural world. The wealthy began to fill their houses with costly, splendid goods, their table settings became more elaborate and dining became a pageant in its own right. This series of whimsical panoramic photographs depict animals reveling around elaborate banquet tables, inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, \\"The Last Supper‚Äù and by Pierre Subleyras classic painting, ‚ÄúThe Feast in the House of Simon‚Äù. The intricate table spreads are carefully arranged, in the style of Dutch still life paintings of the 17th century. The series features anthropomorphized creatures great and small; from Elephants enjoying piles of peanuts and large stacks of peanut butter sandwiches to Honeybees swarming miniature trays of nectar flowers, and many other creatures winged, hoofed and found under the sea. Some of the animals are exotic, some we see everyday. Created during extensive travel with goats from a suburb of Sarajevo in Bosnia, lar gibbons from Thailand, starfish from Norway, bison from Indiana USA, and three toed sloths found along the Amazon River in Peru to name just a few. The series utilizes the icon of the banquet and \\"Last Supper\\" to subtly encourage viewers to consider those in the animal kingdom more humanly affording them more rights and status. To see animals humanely sometimes requires us to see them as human-like. By placing animals in a setting typically reserved for humans, it raises the question of whether we may have more in common than we admit. The feasts invite the viewers to reflect on the nature of society, our relationship and responsibility to the creatures we share the planet with. Ed Schoenfield, New York restaurateur, commissioned Rosen to photograph a duck feast for his restaurant after seeing the series. =Lectures= Rosen has taught workshops around the world through multiple organizations, including B&H;, Gulf Photo Plus, SCAD, and Hallmark Institute. Recently she gave an artist talk at the National Geographic Photography Seminar in Washington DC. Personal life At the encouragement of Beth Taubner, creative consultant of Mercurylab, Rosen researched her ancestry and discovered that her maternal grandfather, who died when her mother, Dolly, was sixteen, was a fashion photographer in Hollywood. He photographed female starlets, posing them with animals. Rosen discovered this fact months after taking similar photographs herself.

After some unsuccessful attempts by two other Mecklenburgian lordships, Werle and Mecklenburg, to take control of Rostock, Nicholas I, placed Rostock under the protection and overlordship of Eric VI, King of Denmark. However, after a successful defence Denmark became Rostock's de facto owner. Already by 1311 Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg sought to take the town of Rostock once more, and succeeded on 15 December 1312. In 1314 Nicholas of Rostock died disempowered and without a male heir. In 1312 the town of Rostock already saw Henry II as a representative of the Danish King. After a further war Henry II conquered Rostock and secured peace with the Danish King Christopher II on 21 May 1323. He received the Lordships of Rostock, Gnoien and Schwaan as hereditary fiefs of Denmark and with that the Lordship of Rostock ceased to exist as an independent entity.

Architecture  Some scholars believe that the castle to have originated from a square tower situated on the north side at the inner courtyard which controlled the northern part of the Colle Ripa. An outdoor courtyard to the east consisted of mill, oil mill and warehouses. Access to the castle is possible via two roads that end in the outdoor courtyard. The oldest road is the one located at the old factories and warehouses, road today no longer viable, the other road, the paved path issue and reached from the south through a drawbridge that serves a cobbled stairway which leads on a plane with a scene. The north fa√ßade was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1907, the facade of which remains a buttressed base and a small corner portion. Through a portal in sandstone and limestone one enters a courtyard covered with a barrel vault with lunettes in which there is stored the beam which put up the drawbridge. From the inner courtyard you can get into some apartments, formerly used as stables and servants quarters and made habitable by the last heirs of his vassals i.e. Franceschelli in 1920, the cellars and the former prisons where there is a sandstone block with written \\"Nolite nocere\\" which means \\"do not do this wicked thing.\\" From the courtyard there is a ramp that puts in the noble quarter divided into several private apartments and only one of them inhabited by the descendants of the feudal lords. The present structure is due to the 16th-17th century. Before the arrival of the Barons Franceschelli in the castle in 1686 they alternated in the same the Sangro and Gizzi. The courtyard of irregular shape adapted to the terrain has seen close around the castle in the various changes that occurred over time.

Craig, first president of the University of Montana. Oscar J. Craig (1846-1911) was the first president of the University of Montana. Craig served as the president between July 1895 to October 1908, and he managed the university almost single-handedly for those thirteen years. Craig taught a few classes each semester, as well as helping to establish the campus itself. He also founded a significant amount of the programs at the university that still persist today. Prior to graduating from DePauw University in 1884, Craig served in the position of Superintendent of City Schools in Sullivan, Indiana for a few years. In 1883, he became a professor at Purdue University, teaching political economy and history before moving to Montana to found the University. Following his presidency, Craig retired from education in 1908 due to ill health. Early life and education Craig was born in 1846 in Jefferson County, Indiana. He served in the 1st Regiment of the Indiana Heavy Artillery during the American Civil War as a private to Captain George W. Branson from August 13, 1864 to July 22, 1865. Craig was discharged from service at age 18 on July 22, 1865, a few months after the end of the Civil War. He was positioned in New Orleans, Louisiana when he received his discharge letter. Craig married Narcissa G. Craig (1848-1937) after serving in the war, and Narcissa would go on to inherit Craig's estate when he died in 1911. Craig earned his undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in 1881 from Asbury University and later went on to earn his postgraduate Master's Degree in 1884 from DePauw University. Finally, he achieved his Ph.D. in History and Political Science from the University of Wooster in Ohio in 1887. Craig taught political science and history courses at Purdue University for roughly a decade before going to Montana in 1895.  Founding of the University  Prior to the arrival of Oscar Craig, the University of Montana consisted of a single building that was built in 1881 and it remained that way until 1895. The number of faculty that were working in the university before 1895 was five people, but during Craig's time as president, that number grew to 27. Craig created a wide variety of programs, and many of them still persist today. He created the Schools of Engineering and Pharmacy, the departments of History, Education, English, Literature, Vocal Expression, Chemistry, Mathematics, Latin and Greek, Modern Languages, Physics and Geology, Biology, Music, and Drawing. This is Frederick Scheuch and Oscar Craig's original plan for the Oval, a focal point of the University campus today. Craig did a majority of the work in the early years of managing the university, not only through hiring more faculty but also by teaching courses in history, philosophy, literature, political science, and psychology. Not only did he create many new academic programs for the university, but he also created multiple extracurricular programs. He helped found The Kaimin student newspaper, the Associated Students at The University of Montana, the Shakespeare Club, the Associated Mechanical Engineers, the Silver Cornet Band, two glee clubs, and several Greek organizations, particularly the Sigma Chi fraternity. He also had a large influence on the multiple buildings that were constructed during his presidency. The most well-known structure on campus that Craig helped construct was The Oval. Craig and a Professor Frederick Scheuch created a map of their intended design for The Oval in 1895, hoping that all of the future buildings on campus would face their entrances towards The Oval. In 1896, the staff of the university helped plant a double row of trees around The Oval in honor of Arbor Day. The Venture Center, the science building of the University, was erected in 1898 along with the University Hall, the main hall. In 1902, the Women's Hall was built and the gymnasium soon followed in 1903. Finally, the University Library was built in 1908 in the Jeannette Rankin Hall, named in honor of Jeannette Rankin, a prominent suffragist who graduated from the University of Montana in 1902. Craig had a large influence in the growth of the university, with the income increasing from $13,551.71 in 1895 to $59,658.10 in 1907. The enrollment of students tripled over these years, and the income grew more than four times. Craig was also able to raise the salary of the professors of the university from $1200 to $2100 at its highest. In the later years of his presidency, Craig hired some of his first faculty, the most notable being J. M. Hamilton, the superintendent of Missoula schools. This allowed Craig to relax from his numerous duties of running most of the school. Not only did Craig work with the University, but he also became the chairman of committees intended to prepare curricula for grade and high schools. By his retirement in 1908, Craig had assisted 26 public secondary school to prepare their students for college.  Legacy  Almost all of the academic programs that Craig started have remained to the present, and many of the extracurricular programs such as The Kaimin newspaper are still active today. Craig also had a dormitory named in his honor, and today, Craig Hall is the university's mathematics building. Craig's famous quote in the early years of the school, \\"The University - it shall prosper,\\" was a driving source of motivation for his successive presidents to maintain the expansion of the university. Most of the buildings that Craig helped found in the early years of the university are also still present, although a few of the original buildings such as the gymnasium were demolished in the 1900s. Perhaps the most lasting landmark that Craig created during his time as president was The Oval, as it is seen as a common symbol of the university today. It is near the center of the university and many building surround it, making it a very popular place for students.

Abner Martin was a farmer and an early settler in Van Buren County. He originally arrived in Van Buren County in 1836. Abner & Lousia Martin began building the home in 1856 and completed construction in 1858. Abner Martin is said to have gone to California during the gold rush and obtained sufficient gold to return to Iowa and build his brick home. The house has a 3-foot-thick foundation, and all bricks were made on the property. A \\"tally brick\\" which told how many bricks were made in a specific day was found on the property. It reads 2,118. The house's historical significance is found in its architecture. The vernacular style structure is influenced by the Federal style. Those influences are found in its long facade wall, and its lack of cornice returns. The two-story, brick house also features a low-pitched roof, which is rare in the county. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The original home and farm consisted of 160 acres, the home retains 13 of those original acres with the current property owners. Mrs. Perry Trible stated, in a 1935 interview, that her and others would hold parties at the Abner Martin House during the Civil War. Some people thought these were secret meetings. Some even went so far as to call the attendees \\"copperheads\\". Mrs Perry Trible recounted one particular instance when having a party at the Abner Martin House involving a Mr. Orth and Mrs. Martin. Mr. Orth, whose stature was slight, was designated to make osculatory advances to Mrs Martin whose stature was anything but slight. Mr Orth was disappointed according to Mrs. Perry Trible's story. The parties or secret meetings were actually nothing more than mostly harmless kissing games. The secret meetings and assumption of being \\"copperheads\\" was likely due to the Martins being lifelong Democrats which may have opposed the Republican lead Civil War with the South. Dick and Oneita Fisher purchased the Abner Martin House in 1973 from Jerry Hootman. It had been unoccupied for several years and in a dilapidated condition. The Bordman Sherod family owned the house for years, and their daughter Blanche and her husband, E. N. (Pat) Murphy, were the last occupants before the Fishers moved in. The Fishers began restoring the home in 1975 while living in the home and were the applicants to place the Abner Martin House on the National Register of Historic Places. The Fishers did most of the work themselves which for them was a labor of love. Dick and Oneita Fisher completed restoration on the home and continued to live in the house into the 1980s but did have to tear down a carriage barn on the property. The Abner Martin House was included on several tours with the local historical societies in the area of both Bentonsport and Keosauqua. After the Fishers, the Abner Martin House again fell into disrepair over the years until it was purchased by Jim & Teresa Huffman in 2006. The Huffmans later began and completed a large restoration project at the house; updating and replacing all interior and exterior structure and materials. The house is currently restored and well maintained on the 13 acres of wooded land. File:Abner Martin House 1979.jpgAbner Martin House in 1979.

Wei's death led to an investigation by the Cyberspace Administration of China, prompting Chinese regulators to impose new restrictions on Baidu advertisements. State media outlets broadly condemned the role of the hospital and Baidu in his death, and users online denounced Baidu's advertising practices. Baidu shares fell almost 14 percent in the days following reports of his death. Treatment and death In 2014, Wei was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects tissue around major joints. After he received radiation and chemotherapy, his family sought out other treatments. Through a promoted result on the Chinese search engine Baidu, Wei discovered the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps, a state military-run hospital which provided an immunotherapy treatment called DC-CIK, for those with his illness. State radio operations claimed Wei's family trusted the treatment because it had been \\"promoted by one of the military hospitals which are considered credible, and the attending doctor had appeared on many mainstream media platforms\\". Wei went through four treatments at the hospital, spending upwards of 200,000 yuan ($ USD) with his family, but the treatments proved unsuccessful, and Wei died on April 12, 2016. Before his death, Wei accused Baidu of promoting false medical information, and he denounced the hospital for claiming high success rates for the treatment. Government investigation and public response Following Wei's death, several Internet users expressed disdain for Baidu's advertising practices. Wei posted an essay responding to the question \\"What do you think is the greatest evil of human nature?\\" on the Chinese question-and-answer website Zhihu which described his experience receiving treatment. The essay, which condemned Baidu's advertising practices, received 44,000 \\"agrees\\" and thousands of comments. On May 2, 2016, the Cyberspace Administration of China announced it would investigate Baidu's role in Wei's death, noting his death \\"drew widespread attention from Internet users\\". A Baidu spokeswoman said the company would cooperate with investigations, asserting that Baidu \\"will give no quarter to fake information or illegal activities online\\". Some Internet users critical of Baidu began referring to it as (), or ‚Äú100 poisons.‚Äù Unlike other search engines such as Google and Yahoo!, promoted search results on Baidu are not clearly distinguished from other content. The investigation concluded that Baidu's pay-for-placement results influenced Wei's medical choices, and influenced the fairness and objectivity of search results. Regulators ordered Baidu to attach \\"eye-catching markers\\" and disclaimers to adverts, reduce the amount of promoted results to 30% of the page, and establish better channels for users to complain about their services. Baidu released a statement accepting the results of the investigation, and announced it would implement the recommendations promptly. Baidu also plans to create a one billion yuan ($ USD) fund to compensate users who suffer demonstrable economic harm from paid results. A separate investigation also found the hospital where Wei received treatment had been illegally working with private healthcare businesses. Baidu shares fell nearly 14 percent following reports of Wei's death in early May 2016. Chinese state media outlet Xinhua and the People's Daily condemned Baidu for Wei's death, the former stating that \\"making money by allowing companies to pay for better search placement is to put a good tool in the hands of interest-seekers with bad intentions\\". One later editorial in the People's Daily called Wei's death a \\"classic\\" example of the unrealistic \\"Chinese-style\\" search for an impossible cure. Around 250,000 people commented on the piece; several denounced the piece for casting the incident as a failure of the family rather than one of Baidu and the hospital. Wei's death also brought attention towards medical entrepreneurs connected with the Putian system, a group of hospitals named after their origin, Putian in Fujian Province. Putian hospitals relied extensively on online advertisements, and Chinese media outlets criticized these promotions' accuracy. Some Chinese media outlets suggested the Putian system was linked with the hospital, but a nurse working at the hospital told the Xi'an newspaper Huashang Bao the hospital was self-managed.

The castle had a very eventful history. It was built on a rocky spur in the valley of the Ehrbach, a right bank valley of the Moselle. Once the fortified heart of a small imperial barony with estates between the Lower Moselle and Middle Rhine, it is today a cultural monument that hosts numerous events.  History  The Ehrenberg was probably already owned by the church in Trier in the Early Middle Ages for use as a place of refuge and defence for the people. The oldest surviving parts of the present Ehrenburg - the upper bailey - are the remains of a fortified house, a rectangular residential tower house. The first half of the 12th century is believed to be when this initially very small Hohenstaufen castle was constructed. In 1161, the castle is mentioned for the first time as Castrum Eremberch in a deed of slighting by Frederick I, also known as Frederick Barbarossa. This document confirms the renunciation of the rights to two churches in the Archbishopric of Trier and to participation in the administration of the city of Trier by his younger half-brother, Count Palatine Conrad of Hohenstaufen. His opponent, Hillin of Falmagne, Archbishop of Trier, was by way of compensation supposed to the transfer the Ehrenburg which was important for guarding the crossing over the Moselle between Brodenbach und Hatzenport and protected the surrounding imperial estate as a sub-fief to the count. This complicated legal arranging which was intended to deal with many disputes, existed until the demise of the electorates of Palatinate and Trier at the end of the 18th century as a result of Napoleon's invasion of Germany. The likely builders of the castle, the lords of Ehrenberg, Dienstm√§nner or vassals of the Cologne and Trier Church and the Rhenish counts Palatine, appear as witnesses for the first time I 1189. The castle became the site of a Ganerbschaft or joint inherited tenancy and was divided among two or three families over the generations. The Ehrenberg coat of arms was azure, a bend or. From the mid-13th century, a second, younger family (the Frederick line) bore a coat of arms in which the gold bend was accompanied by small crosses and, from around 1480, by golden lilies. In 1331 the imperial ministeriales who occupied the castles of Waldeck, Sch√∂neck, Eltz and Ehrenburg formed an alliance. During the Eltz Feud they fought against the territorial policy of the Elector of Trier, Baldwin of Luxembourg, who was trying bring peace and stability to an unsafe area in which the knights were becoming lawless. Five years later the two sides agreed a treaty, the Eltz Atonement, and the knights had to recognise the sovereignty of the Electorate of Trier in return for being granted burgrave status and becoming hereditary peers. In 1397 the last Ehrenberg knight became involved in another feud with the Elector of Trier, Werner of Falkenstein and destroyed over 200 houses in his city of Koblenz. In a counter-campaign, the castle was besieged by the citizens of Koblenz and a cannon deployed (which was still rare at that time). A year later, John of Sch√∂nberg was enfeoffed with the castle and barony. In 1426 he was followed by Cuno of Pyrmont and of Ehrenberg, in 1526 by Philipp Eltz, in 1561 by the lords of Quadt of Landskron and in 1621 by the House of Hoensbroech (Dutch: Van Hoensbroeck). In the course of the Thirty Years' War the Spanish occupied the castle from 1640 to 1651. In 1668 the Ehrenburg was enfeoffed to the Freiherrn of Clodt. On 1 November 1688, French troops und Louis XIV occupied the castle during the War of the Palatine Succession and, a year later, blew up parts of the site. The castle chapel survived and was not abandoned until the following century. After the male line of the Ehrenbergs died out in the late 14th century, the castle was no longer the long-term residence of hereditary castellans (Burgherren). For the castellans that followed the castle and barony of Ehrenberg was only a part of their fief and their estate. The last imperial knight and castellan, the Freiherr Benedict of Clodt, Lord of Landscron, Ehrenberg, Hennen, Grimberg, Meill and Thomberg lived in the late 18th century as the Electoral presiding judge (Gerichtspr√§sident) mainly in the Ehrenberger Hof on the M√ºnzplatz in Koblenz. In 1798 the castle went into the possession of the Lord of Stein. In 1831 it passed to the House of Kielmannsegg and in 1924 to the Count of Kanitz-Cappenberg. From 1991 the Ehrenburg has been privately owned and, since 1993, preserved and rebuilt by volunteers of the Friends of the Ehrenburg (Freundeskreis der Ehrenburg) from private funding.

The battle was a disaster for the Saxons, killing many knights and their leader William, Margrave of the Nordmark. Pritzlawa first appears as iuxta Wiribeni Albim in the Chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg. He reported that Emperor Henry II met there several times with Poles, resulting more often than not in war rather than peace. After their defeat during the Great Slav Rising of 983, the Germans were anxious to recover their old rule. The peace imposed by Emperor Conrad II was twice broken under the rule of Henry III. In 1045, he led an expedition and they quickly submitted, returning to pay tribute. After ten years of negotiation the Liutizen again rose up and the emperor dispatched William of the Nordmark and a Count Dietrich (it is unclear as to who this count was) with a large force to rein them in. In 1056, the Saxons made their move to disastrous results. Led by Margrave William, he and his knights and horsemen drowned in the flooding of the Havel. Both William and Dietrich fell in this battle, where a ruined castle still overlooks the confluence of the Havel and the Elbe. (The number of knights lost has been estimated in the thousands, which is doubtful.) The news of this defeat apparently seriously impacted the seriously ill Emperor Henry III, possibly hastening his death. The result of the battle was inconclusive, with the Poles turning to internal affairs under Casimir I the Restorer.  Sources  *Bury, J. B.

In his work as a botanist he has collected plants in all 50 states of the United States of America, as well as several additional countries. Atha's work is focused on three areas: \\"floristics‚Äîwhat plants grow in a particular region; taxonomy‚Äîhow to tell one plant from another, what to call it and what it's related to; and applied botany‚Äîhow plants are used for food, medicine, shelter and other useful purposes.\\" Atha is a prominent regional botanist, and the high-profile botanical projects with which has been involved (such as the recent Spontaneous Flora of Central Park project) have garnered national and international attention.

Atha is involved in work related to invasive plants in the greater-New York City region, including Westchester County. Atha is also the Associate Editor for Brittonia. New York City EcoFlora This project, in the prototyping phase through 2017, is designed to engage New York city residents in protecting and preserving New York City's native plant species. The project aims to use citizen scientists to gather and organize data related to plants, animals, fungi, and habitats in the region. These data will then be synthesized with existing historic natural history collections and scientific publications. \\"The New York City EcoFlora will be a real-time, online, ongoing checklist of plants‚Äîthe first ever to connect plants in the web of life in New York City‚Äîthat will result in a dynamic resource for conservation planning as well as in New Yorkers that are better informed about the importance of urban ecologies and who can contribute to protecting them.\\" Flora of Central Park One of Atha's research projects involves documenting and collecting every naturally occurring plant in Central Park. This project represents a collaboration between The New York Botanical Garden, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The aims of this project are to document the wild flora of Central Park, and to provide an up-to-date botanical inventory \\"to aid on-going restoration, conservation, education and recreation programs and to document the flora for scientific, ecological and conservation studies.\\" The quote below comes from an interview Atha gave to The New York Times in 2015 Emerging Invasive: Corydalis incisa Atha and others at the New York Botanical Garden and Lower Hudson PRISM (one of eight Partnerships for Regional Invasive Species Management in New York State) coordinate a team of citizen scientists to document and remove Corydalis incisa, an emerging invasive species found along the Bronx River in Westchester County, NY and Bronx County, NY.

It was among the first medical colleges to admit both men and women but they attended separate sessions (fall term for women, spring term for men).

In 1857, it moved to Twelfth and Chestnut Streets, then three years later to 910 Arch Street. At the Arch Street home a dispensary was opened in 1860, and in 1862 a dental department was established.

His studies for the Priesthood took place at the then-Seminary of St Michael, Kingston, as well as in England at the now-closed St Joseph's College, Upholland, Lancashire. Priesthood He was ordained on 12 August 1970 and appointed Parochial Vicar in such circumstances that he served the Churches of the Holy Rosary (Windward Town) and St Joseph (Spanish Town). He moved to the Churches of St Benedict (Harbour View), the African Martyrs of Uganda (Bull Bay) and Christ the King (Port Royal) in 1972 where he served for some ten years as Pastor of the respective parish(es). Then, for another ten years after this, he was made Rector of the Seminary, the first such who could call it his alma mater. He was also, for some time between 1982 and 1996, Pastor of Christ the King Church in August Town. His express focus in these roles was youth, the poor and the marginalised, as seen (for the former) in having been the founding Chairman of Harbour View's public secondary school, Donald Quarrie High.Donald Quarrie High School, Teenage Observer (Jamaica Observer)Schools Directory 2012 , Ministry of Education, Youth and Information, p. 5 On 18 December 1983, Dufour was awarded the Jamaican Prime Minister's Medal of Appreciation; on 18 April 1991 he was appointed an Honorary Prelate of His HolinessActa Apostolicae Sedis, vol. 84 (1992), p. 96. and in 1993 he was Chairman of the Organising Committee for Pope John Paul II's visit to the island (9 ‚Äì 11 AugustApostolic Journey to Jamaica, Mexico and Denver (Colorado), John Paul II (The Holy See)). Episcopacy =Diocese of Montego Bay= On 6 December 1995, it was announced that Dufour was elected by John Paul to be the second Bishop of Montego Bay,Acta Apostolicae Sedis, vol. 88 (1996), pp. 298-300. after His Holiness had promoted Edgerton Clarke as Archbishop of Kingston the previous year. He was ordained by Clarke on 10 February, with the latter's immediate predecessor Archbishop Samuel Carter, SJ, and Bishop Paul Boyle, CP, then Vicar Apostolic of Mandeville, as the principal co-consecrators.Archbishop Charles Henry Dufour, Hierarchy of the Catholic Church (Catholic- Hierarchy.org) His social engagement over the next fifteen years would include: * the Peace Management Initiative, of which he was the first chairman (March 2003 ‚Äì February 2008) * the Parliamentary Salaries CommissionWebsite homepage , Jamaica Parliamentarians Salaries' Review Commission * the Police (Civilian Oversight) Authority (PCOA), of which he was appointed Chairman in 2008 by Governor-General Sir Kenneth O. Hall * the Good Shepherd Foundation, of his own establishment and patronage On a visit to Ghana in July 1997 Bishop Dufour ordained several Priests and met Opoku Ware II, then leader of the Ashanti peoples, who kissed the Bishop's hand in welcome and out of respect. In 2006 Dufour was honoured by his country as a Commander of the Order of Distinction. On 8 August of the same year he was appointed Apostolic Administrator of Mandeville by Pope Benedict XVI, because His Holiness had on that day accepted the early resignation of Bishop Gordon Bennett, SJ. Dufour remained in this role until this ceased two days short of two years in, when Neil Tiedemann, CP, took possession of his appointed Diocese during his Ordination as Bishop. =Archdiocese of Kingston in Jamaica= On 15 April 2011 it was announced that Dufour was himself promoted, by Benedict, as the sixth Archbishop of Kingston in Jamaica, after His Holiness had accepted the resignation of Donald Reece (which was announced in the same release).Rinunce e Nomine, 15.04.2011 (B0220), Press Office of the Holy See (in Italian) The Archbishop-designate took possession of his appointed Archdiocese during his installation on 16 June. In this way as well his social engagement continued, at least with reference to the PCOA and up to 2012, since he continued as its Chairman by re-appointment from Governor-General Sir Patrick Allen. Coat of arms Coat of arms of Archbishop Dufour :Regarding the personal arms On a field of blue, signifying the Virgin Mary, a Chi Rho is centrally placed, just as Christ is the centre of a Bishop's life as teacher and servant of the People of God. Clouds are found in chief, with three lines radiating above them, to recall the voice of God the Father whose favour rested on his Son and his Son's mission; this being expressed in the motto: Sent to serve (cf. Mark 10: 45). To the left of the Christogram is a jug of water pouring into a basin, to symbolise cleansing in a typical Jamaican way, and to the right is a pair of cupped hands, being ‚Äúat once clasped in prayer and open for service‚Äù. The Trinity is completed with the dove hovering over the Christogram, the Holy Spirit which must inspire wisdom and love in those whom Christ calls to serve as Priests, like the armiger. Finally, flames make for canting arms as the surname ‚ÄúDufour‚Äù means of the furnace in the language of the armiger's father, French. But the flames are also indicative of the fervour and zeal with which he ministers.Kingston ‚Äî Prelate Information, Antilles Episcopal Conference =Resignation= On 29 April 2016, four days after a year passed since Dufour turned 75 and submitted his resignation, it was announced that Pope Francis accepted it and promoted Bishop Kenneth Richards of St John's‚ÄìBasseterre as the seventh Archbishop of Kingston in Jamaica. Now, until Archbishop-designate Richards takes possession of his appointed Archdiocese on 6 July, Dufour is automatically its Diocesan Administrator.Cf. art. 418 ¬ß2 of the Code of Canon Law. But it was also announced that Francis appointed Bishop Tiedemann an Auxiliary of Brooklyn.Other Pontifical Acts, 29.04.2016, Press Office of the Holy See Thus, with Mandeville vacant, once more Dufour was appointed its Apostolic Administrator. He has written of being the ‚ÄúAdministrator-Elect‚Äù and of being ‚Äúinstalled‚Äù in that Diocese on 7 July,Statement of His Grace Archbishop Charles H. Dufour to the Faithful of Kingston, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kingston which suggests change in its jurisdiction,Cf. the legal definition (cf. can. 371 ¬ß2) of ‚ÄúApostolic Administrator‚Äù, which accounts for most of the wikipedia article under the same name (cited above). but it may simply reflect the fact that his first time in this role ad hoc was lengthy. At any rate, Dufour remains the only Bishop who has ever been named personallyAs opposed to being named ex officio, such as any Archbishop of Kingston is as Metropolitan to all three Dioceses in Jamaica in an official capacity.Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kingston in Jamaica, GCatholic.org Personal life Though he has received such dignitaries as the Canadian Prime Minister (Jean Chr√©tien), the Cuban President (Fidel Castro) and the Spanish Crown (Juan Carlos and Sof√≠a), Dufour has continued working with youth and those in prison. The latter is evident in having ministered at Fort Augusta, Tower Street (formerly known as the General Penitentiary) and South Camp. In fact he has sat on the Board of Visitors for the two latter institutions. He has also been Vice-President of the National Committee for Justice and Peace and Unity. Dufour has also remained active for having been so active: he enjoys mountaineering and has practised several times on the Blue Mountain Peak. Furthermore, at least up to 2012, he has been keeping fit with regular visits to the gym. Finally, as when a day is over, Dufour relaxes to (classical) music; it is presumably with that genre that he was somewhat familiar in high school. He enjoys Beethoven, taking inspiration from the fact that ‚Äúwhen he became deaf in his (twenties), he refused to give up and wrote some beautiful pieces‚Äù. But he has also been a fan of Bob Marley for years and owns ‚Äúa collection of his work‚Äù, of which his favourite is Redemption Song because, in his own words, \\"it encourages us to rid our minds of mental slavery.\\" He sums up this side of him thus: \\"I like music of all types ‚Äì Greek, Russian, American, African drumming and others.\\" See also References The following sources provide most of this article's content: * Curriculum Vitae of the Most Rev.

Description and history  Benjamin Franklin Pearson was a Maryland native who settled in Iowa in 1835 after it was opened to settlement. He had a storied service in the Union forces during the American Civil War. Afterward, he returned to Iowa and became a master stone mason who built this house and other structures in southeastern Iowa, including Old Main at Iowa Wesleyan University. He was a devout Methodist who hosted services on the upper floor of his house. Pearson was also an abolitionist and involved with the Underground Railroad. The home he built for his family in Keosauqua, Iowa in 1845 was a two-story structure, and is a rare vernacular Georgian style house in Iowa. Pearson imported the style from his native Maryland. The exterior of the first story is stone while the second is brick. Unbeknownst to those around him, he also included a hidden cellar. It was there that slaves escaping the Confederacy were successfully hidden on their journey North. A tornado in 1967 destroyed the chimneys and most of the brick from the east wall. Ironically, it was rebuilt using brick from a place of worship known locally in those days as the \\"Negro Church\\", a structure that had been destroyed in the same storm. The church was a landmark dating back to a time during Reconstruction and well into the 20th century when the black population of Keosauqua was sizable. A gift, perhaps, to a man who helped them in their time of greatest need. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1978.

According to Daily Beast, Fisher used several pseudonyms, including \\"redpillschool\\" and \\"Morpheus Manfred\\", which was used for several media interviews on behalf of the forum. Speaking to WMUR, Fisher admitted to writing at least some of the material attributed to him, which he characterized as \\"some injudicious things about the opposite sex following a bad breakup\\", including, from a 2008 post: > Rape isn't an absolute bad, because the rapist I think probably likes it a > lot. I think he'd say it's quite good, really. ... . I think rape is bad, > I'm not arguing for it. I'm arguing against the idea of an absolute truth. Fisher also told WMUR: > That was an out-of-context quote from a nearly decade-old debate about the > failings of moral relativism.\\" Following bipartisan comments calling for him to resign from his state House of Representatives seat, Fisher stated in April that he did not plan to do so. On 17 May, a Republican-led House committee voted 8-6 along party lines to recommend no disciplinary action against Fisher. And yet, less than an hour later, while an investigation for perjury was getting started, Fisher resigned under social and political pressure.

Police reported a \\"strong odor of raw marijuana\\" emanating from the room. According to an affidavit, the duo told police they had brought marijuana with them, which Shortey said they were smoking when police arrived. Video from the arrest released by Moore police show Shortey in the motel room wearing a T-shirt that reads, \\"now go make me a sandwich.\\" Above a cartoon drawing of a sandwich, it cites , a Bible verse that calls on women to obey their husbands.

The age of consent in Oklahoma is 16, but, under state law, engaging in prostitution with anyone under 18 is illegal. \\"The age of consent in Oklahoma is 16, but Oklahoma's prostitution statute applies to any person under 18 years old.\\" After the reports emerged, but before charges were filed, the Oklahoma Senate unanimously voted to strip Shortey of a variety of privileges, including his parking space, office, and positions on committees, although he retained his seat, ability to vote, and salary. A number of Oklahoma officials from both parties called upon Shortey to step down, including Governor Mary Fallin. Shortey resigned from office on March 22, 2017‚Äîsix days after being charged.  Indictment and sentencing  On September 5, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Shortey on four federal sex trafficking and child pornography charges, involving both the March incident and videos that Shortey is accused of distributing from his smartphone in 2012 and 2013. Shortey pleaded not guilty to these charges. After the federal charges were announced, the Cleveland County district attorney dropped the state charges. A federal jury trial had been scheduled for December 2017. On November 19, 2017, Shortey reached an agreement to plead guilty on November 30 to one count of child sex trafficking; the prosecutor agreed to have the child pornography counts removed. Shortey was jailed immediately after pleading guilty on November 30 and faced a sentence of at least 10 years in prison, with Judge Timothy D. DeGiusti to decide in 2018. In early December 2017, police released their video of Shortey's arrest at a motel where he was found with a 17-year-old male prostitute. In June 2018, prosecutors revealed in a sentencing memorandum that Shortey had sex twice with the victim in the year before they were found together at the hotel. Prosecutors also informed the judge that they would seek full restitution from Shortey for the victim's losses, including the cost of any care. Shortey's lawyer said it would not yet be appropriate to comment. Jailed since his guilty plea, Shortey was sentenced in Oklahoma City federal court on September 17, 2018, to a total of 15 years in prison, and 10 years of supervised release. In sentencing testimony, Shortey apologized to his family, fellow Christians, and his constituents. His attorney, who said the sentence was fair, requested that Shortey serve it at a facility in Texas with a sex offender rehab program; the Bureau of Prisons placed Shortey at the Federal Correctional Institution, Seagoville in Seagoville, Texas. In February 2019, U.S. District Judge DeGiusti imposed a restitution fine on Shortey of $125,850, about half of the maximum amount.  Political positions  Shortey was a staunch conservative in the Republican-dominated legislature. The Oklahoman noted that Shortey filed bills that \\"often drew national attention and, at times, national ridicule.\\"Nolan Clay, State senator resigns after being charged, The Oklahoman (March 22, 2017). The Associated Press reported that as a state senator, Shortey \\"routinely voted with his Republican colleagues on bills targeting gay and transgender people,\\" including a measure passed in 2017 to allow business owners to discriminate against LGBT people. Shortey was also known for his firm opposition to illegal immigration and gun control.Kristine Phillips, Okla. state senator accused of trying to have sex with teen boy now plans to resign, attorney says, Washington Post (March 21, 2017). He maintained that state legislators had a constitutional right to carry guns in the Oklahoma State Capitol. Duane Chapman (\\"Dog the Bounty Hunter\\") and his wife Beth were supporters of legislation introduced by Shortey to regulate the bounty-hunting industry. Shortey took a \\"hard-line stance against abortion\\" and in 2012 proposed legislation to outlaw the use of aborted fetuses in food; the widely ridiculed bill did not receive a committee hearing. In response, Shortey explained his intent was to deter the use of human embryonic stem cells in research by private companies. In February 2017, Shortey came under public criticism for trying to undo loosened state drug laws which Oklahoma voters approved in November 2016. Arguing that voters had not considered the consequences of their vote, Shortey introduced a bill in the Senate to increase the penalties for drug possession within feet of a church or a school, which Oklahoma voters had voted to classify as a misdemeanor instead of a felony. Although Shortey's district was close to the Capitol, he frequently missed votes; the Associated Press noted that according to an online bill tracking service, Shortey missed nearly half of the votes taken in the Senate.  Personal life  According to his senate biography, Shortey married his \\"high school sweetheart\\" Jennifer. They have four daughters. When the couple divorced in 2018 after 16 years, his wife and children changed their last name. Shortey was known in the Senate for his imposing size, standing tall and weighing .

Rounds was a multifaceted craftsman. He contracted in October 1898 with Lewis L. McArthur to lead the landscape construction of the Wawashkamo golf course. The golf links opened in 1899 as built by Rounds and his crew, and became the oldest course in Michigan on which golf is played on the original grounds.

Historic Wawashkamo hazards such as the \\"chocolate drops\\" on the 8th and 17th hole were raised by Rounds and his men with fieldstones uncovered during the landscaping. During the first decade of the twentieth century, Rounds' expertise with fieldstones and durable mortar led to enduring additions to Mackinac Island architecture.

It has been used as everything from a chieftaincy title to a part of praise poetry. History The Eso of Ikoyi were a class of military aristocrats that were just a rank below the Oyo Mesi (or council of State) of Old Oyo, a Yoruba empire that flourished in the medieval and early modern periods.Sotunde, F.I. (2002), \\"Egba Chieftaincy Institution\\", p 61. They were originally a professional group of cavalry officers who became the elite corps of the Oyo army. They evolved within a number of prominent families in Ikoyi, in the metropolitan province of Oyo in the 17th and 18th centuries, manifesting and sustaining high standards of bravery and proficiency, with their own culture and code of honour handed down from father to son. With the collapse of the empire at the beginning of the 19th century, and the shift of the capital southwards into the forest zone, cavalry ceased to be the elite of Oyo's army, and the Eso of Ikoyi were dispersed to learn new arts of war. Among generations of descendants, young men in several locations often called Ikoyi aspired to live up to the reputation of the Eso. By the second half of the 19th century, Eso had become a title of honour that was conferred on individual younger warriors for outstanding achievement in battle, reminiscent of the bravery and code of honour of the Eso of Ikoyi. Johnson, Samuel (1921), \\"The History of the Yorubas from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate\\", pp 73-75. Notable bearers *Okukenu, Sagbua I of Egbaland. Although Sagbua was originally an Eso title, its first Egba bearer, Okukenu, was admitted to the civil division of the Ogboni of Egbaland while holding it. Due to this, it remains a civil title to this day in that kingdom. Okukenu later relinquished it in order to become the first Alake of Egbaland. *Lasilo, Osiele I of Osiele. A contemporary of Okukenu's and a fellow holder of an originally Eso chieftaincy, Lasilo was admitted to the military division of the Egba Ogboni while holding the title of Osiele. He thus became the first Egba chief to rule over the Osiele military outpost that eventually became a suburb of Abeokuta. Like Sagbua, Osiele continues to be used as a title of honour in the Egba chieftaincy hierarchy to this day. *Kayode Eso, a justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Mr. Eso's grandfather, Ifaturoti, was a holder of the Eso chieftaincy title. As a result, the Eso family of Ilesha's praise poetry describes their history: Eso Ikoyi, Eso Aduroja, Apara Ogun bi eni pa'le. When translated to English, this becomes \\"Eso of Ikoyi, the one who waits to fight, who finishes off the war with the care of one rubbing paint on a paved wall\\".J.F.

His father, George Fulton, a captain in the Royal Engineers, was killed at Lucknow in 1857. Fred was educated at Cheltenham College in England and then moved to New Zealand. His cricket career was marred by a severe injury to one of his arms in 1874. He was scutching flax at the mill where he worked in Outram, just outside Dunedin, when his arm was drawn into the machine and broken in several places. The arm was saved by Professor Duncan McGregor at Dunedin Hospital, using Joseph Lister's recently discovered principles of antisepsis. Despite his damaged arm Fulton played cricket for many years for the Carisbrook club in Dunedin and represented Otago before moving to Napier in 1881 and playing for Hawke's Bay.

Composed in Latin by an anonymous author from Bari in the first quarter of the 12th century, it covers the years 855‚Äì1118, concentrating first and foremost on the events in Bari and Apulia. The First Crusade is followed in some detail, however, as are the Byzantine affairs. Anonymi Barensis Chronicon has much content in common with two other Bariot chronicles, Annales Barenses and, especially, Annales Lupi Protospatharii (with which it also shares the beginning). Therefore, all three are assumed to be based on some older chronicle that no longer survives. The Chronicon becomes more detailed from the 1040s on, also diverging in coverage from the other chronicles. No medieval copy of Anonymi Barensis Chronicon is known. The survival of the chronicle is due to the 17th-century Italian historian Camillo Pellegrino who transcribed the text from a manuscript in Salerno and published it in Naples in 1643. In 1724, it was reprinted in volume 5 of Rerum Italicarum scriptores, influential corpus of historical sources first compiled by the Italian historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori. In 1753, Francesco Maria Pratilli published a number of fake chronicles, including a forgery based on the Chronicon.

She has published six books, including a novel, poetry collection, short story collection, and a memoir. Her narrative and critical writing have been published in a variety of journals and collections. Bociurkiw has also directed and co-directed ten films and videos which have been screened at film festivals on several continents. Her work appears in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the National Archives of Canada, and many university libraries. She founded or co-founded the media organizations Emma Productions, Winds of Change Productions, and The Studio for Media Activism & Critical Thought.

Early years Bociurkiw was born in Edmonton, Alberta to Vera Anne (n√©e Wasylyshyn) and Bohdan Rostyslav Bociurkiw,. Her father was co-founder of the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. Ukrainian history and culture were central to Bociurkiw's childhood, and instilled in her a sense of Ukrainian identity and history, as well as a desire to rewrite that history.Grekul, Lisa, \\"Pedagogies in Practice\\" in Sugars, Cynthia ed., Home-work: Postcolonialism, Pedagogy, and Canadian Literature, University of Ottawa Press Ottawa: 2004. 378 This is a common thread throughout Bociurkiw's books, essays, and films: reflecting critically and intersectionally on what it means to be Ukrainian, Canadian, feminist, and lesbian.

While there, she discovered feminist art and the new field of video art. She studied with Bruce Barber and Garry Neill Kennedy. She was part of what Barber has called \\"the gathering momentum of a feminist movement at NSCAD\\",Barber, Bruce, \\"Introduction\\" in Barber ed., NSCAD: The 80's, Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery 2006. 10 co-founding the Women Artists' File at the NSCAD Library, which later inspired the Toronto-based Women's Art Resource Centre. She was active on the board of the Centre for Art Tapes in Halifax, where she curated a Toronto- Halifax exchange of activist performance art entitled \\"Performance As Resistance\\" (1985), which featured dub poets Lillian Allen and Clifton Joseph, humourist Sheila Gostick and Halifax a capella group Four The Moment.Barber, Bruce, \\"Introduction\\" in Barber ed., NSCAD: The 80's, Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery 2006. 10. After graduating from NSCAD, she moved to Toronto and in 1983, collectively produced the documentary, Our Choice, A Tape About Teenage Mothers (Women's Media Alliance). In 1984, she co-founded the feminist video collective, Emma Productions, which produced several works, including No Small Change: The Story of the Eaton's Strike (dir. Ruth Bishop & Marusya Bociurkiw 1985) and Bullets for a Revolution (dir. Marusya Bociurkiw 1988). These films were produced and screened in the context of the dynamic feminist media culture in 1980's Toronto.Masters, Philinda, \\"Women, Culture & Communications\\", in Pierson, Ruth & Griffin Cohen, Marjorie eds., Canadian Women's Issues: Volume I: Strong Voices, Lorimer 1993. 401. No Small Change: The Story of the Eaton's Strike and Bociurkiw's own film Playing with Fire (1986) were included in a 1989-1990 touring exhibition called Rebel Girls: A Survey of Canadian Feminist Videotapes 1974-1988. These were followed by several more single-authored works, including Unspoken Territory, about the history of racial profiling in Canada; and the more recent This is Gay Propaganda: LGBT Rights and the War in Ukraine (2015). This film uses interviews with LGBT Ukrainians to explore the role of queer activists in Ukraine's Euromaidan Revolution and the Russian occupation that followed. Bociurkiw's films have screened at film festivals on several continents. Bociurkiw is also an award-winning writer and media studies scholar. Her narrative and critical writing have been widely published in such journals and collections as Border/Lines, Fuse, Rites Magazine, The Journey Prize Anthology (McClelland & Stewart), Dykewords (Women's Press), Queer Looks (Routledge), Two Lands, New Vision (Coteau) and Unbound: Ukrainian Canadians Writing Home (University of Toronto Press).

In 2011, she published the academic book, Feeling Canadian: Television Nationalism & Affect (Wilfrid Laurier University Press). Bociurkiw promotes feminist and anti-racist pedagogy and research through the Studio for Media Activism & Critical Thought, a research hub at Ryerson University that blurs the boundaries between media art, activism, and scholarly investigation. It organizes a yearly speakers' series, symposia, student mentorship, and an online graduate journal. In 2015, the Studio's Speaker Series‚Äîwhich is open to Ryerson students, faculty and the public‚Äîfeatured Indigenous Scholar, Dr. Raven Sinclair; media artist, Deanna Bowen; and anti-poverty activists Cathy Crowe. More recently, The Studio has organized the annual Laboratory for Feminist Memory, that celebrates and remediates the archive of Toronto second wave feminism ‚Äì especially its intersectional, racialized and queer aspects.,https://nowtoronto.com/events/the-laboratory-of-feminist-memory-bar/ featuring such artists as Midi Onodera, Thirza Cuthand, and Zainub Verjee. Activism As founder of the feminist video collective Emma Productions, and as an out queer, Bociurkiw was very active in the Toronto and Vancouver feminist movement, peace, and LGBT social movements throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the 1980s, she was active in Women's Action for Peace, International Women's Day Coalition, the pro-choice movement, the Latin American solidarity movement, and Women for Economic Justice While living in Montreal, she co-designed and co-taught the first course on LGBT cinema in Canada, at Concordia University, with Thomas Waugh.

LGBT people in Ukraine had a lot to lose from the rise of Russian political influences there. As a result of the illegal occupation and annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014‚Äîbringing it under the Russian LGBT propaganda law‚Äîmany LGBT Ukrainians from Crimea and Donetsk were forced to flee to safe houses in Kiev and Odessa. Though the law criminalizing same sex sexual activity under Soviet Union law was revoked when Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, there remains a high level of social censure. Political leaders in Ukraine, before and after Euromaidan, have been reluctant to pass anti-discrimination legislation, despite pressure to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. After many delays, a law banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity was finally passed on November 12, 2015. Russian and religious influences continue to threaten the safety and social recognition of LGBT people in Ukraine. Bociurkiw's film draws attention to this struggle and gives voice to the heroes of the Ukrainian LGBT rights movement. Bociurkiw continues to engage in activist research, teaching, and production; initiating courses like Social Justice Media and #Activism.
