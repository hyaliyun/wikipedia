Ellis has been involved in political lobbying for 35 years. Jim began his career with the San Diego County Republican Party, and then served as an original staff member for then-Congressman Bill Lowery (R-CA). He also worked as President of the Ramhurst Corporation of North Carolina and as a manager of the Public Issues Department of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in Winston- Salem, North Carolina. Political Action Committee Background Ellis was the executive director of the Americans for a Republican Majority political action committee (ARMPAC). As such, he was swept up in the indictment of U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader, Tom DeLay in September 2005. \\"The powerful Republican congressman was named, along with two political associates, in an indictment handed up by a Travis County grand jury. ... The conspiracy count charges DeLay, 58, and associates John Colyandro and Jim Ellis with wrongdoing in connection with the operation of Texans for a Republican Majority, a political action committee founded by the politician. Since House GOP rules require leaders to step down if charged criminally, DeLay immediately announced that he was relinquishing his leadership post. DeLay, who has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in connection with the PAC's operations, has said that the Texas probe was politically motivated by Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle, a Democrat.\\" DeLay was found guilty in November 2010 of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. However, after years of appeals and \\"siding with a decision made ... by a lower appeals court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 2014 refused to reinstate money- laundering convictions against former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. In an 8-1 decision, the state's highest criminal court backed [an earlier] Texas 3rd Court of Appeals decision that reversed DeLay's ... convictions on money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The court had ruled there was not enough evidence to prove that DeLay's actions were criminal.\\" In September 2012, Ellis pleaded guilty in his own separate campaign finance case related to the DeLay court case to a felony charge of making an illegal campaign contribution during the 2002 election. \\"Ellis received a four-year probation and was fined $10,000 on a charge that he made a contribution of corporate money to a political party within 60 days of an election. ... Under the terms of Ellis‚Äô plea, the adjudication of the third-degree felony charge is deferred ... \\" In other words, the plea agreement reached included a fine for a post-deadline political contribution under Texas law and also included a vacated decision after a period of four years.

The state highway designation ends at I-240, although Sooner Road continues north to its terminus at I-35, I-44, Turner Turnpike, Kilpatrick Turnpike, and SH-66. State Highway 77H was originally created to serve the now-defunct town of Hollywood. This likely explains why the suffix \\"H\\" was assigned when letters earlier in the alphabet were available. Route description State Highway 77H begins at the intersection of 12th Avenue N.E. and Tecumseh Road in Norman. US-77 follows 12th Avenue south of the intersection and Tecumseh Road west of it, with SH-77H following 12th Avenue north of the intersection. Throughout its length, SH-77H is an undivided four-lane road. It intersects other streets at grade, and has numerous traffic signals. Former SH-77H (now part of US-77) following 12th Avenue in Norman The northernmost mile of SH-77H (from S.E. 89th Street to I-240) is in Oklahoma County, and the remainder of the route is in Cleveland County. The route is popular with local commuters as an alternative to I-35 between Norman and Oklahoma City. Norman commuters typically use it to head north to Tinker Air Force Base and the Midwest City‚ÄìDel City area. Oklahoma City commuters typically drive south to the University of Oklahoma. =Designations= SH-77H is also designated as Sooner Road in Moore and Oklahoma City, and as 12th Avenue N.E. in Norman. Locals often refer to the entire length of the road as Sooner Road, ignoring both the highway number and its designation as 12th Avenue in Norman. Oklahoma Senate Bill 280, passed by the 2003 Legislature, named the highway the Pearl Harbor/ Memorial Highway. This designation was subsequently applied by the Oklahoma Transportation Commission on 2003-06-02. Signage was installed at each end of the highway displaying the name. History State Highway 77H was originally commissioned on 1950-01-11, running from Hollywood in Cleveland County to the Oklahoma County line. This original iteration of SH-77H was decommissioned less than two years later, being removed from the state highway system on 1951-11-05 SH-77H was returned to active service on 1955-02-07. This time, the highway began at the corner of Porter Avenue and Robinson Street in Norman and traveled north to the previous SH-77H's southern terminus at Hollywood. On 1959-02-27, the Department of Highways assumed maintenance of Sunnylane Road south of S.E. 29th Street (at that time part of SH-3), adding it to SH-77H. This made all of the old SH-77H part of the new SH-77H, and extended the highway's northern terminus into the Oklahoma City suburb of Del City. On 1977-06-06, the highway was extended further north into Del City along Sunnylane Road to Reno Avenue, where it turned west, ending at US-77 (which followed Lincoln Boulevard at the time). On 1988-12-12, SH-77H was removed from Sunnylane Avenue and Porter Avenue and redesignated one section line east onto Sooner Road and 12th Avenue. At the same time, it was truncated to I-240 in Oklahoma City, and its southern terminus became the 12th Avenue‚ÄìClassen Boulevard intersection in Norman. Before this rerouting, SH-77H served as SH-37's eastern terminus, but when SH-77H was moved, SH-37 was not extended to meet the new alignment. Thus, SH-37 still ends at Sunnylane Road, one block short of SH-77H. In April 2009, US-77 was realigned through Norman. The portion of 12th Avenue between Classen Boulevard and Tecumseh Road became part of US-77. This change shortened SH-77H by , and brought its terminus to the present-day location of the 12th Avenue‚ÄìTecumseh Road intersection.

The incident occurred less than three months after the United States entered World War II in response to the Imperial Japanese Navy's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and one day after the bombardment of Ellwood near Santa Barbara on 23 February. Initially, the target of the aerial barrage was thought to be an attacking force from Japan, but speaking at a press conference shortly afterward, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox called the purported attack a \\"false alarm\\". Newspapers of the time published a number of reports and speculations of a cover-up. When documenting the incident in 1949, the United States Coast Artillery Association identified a meteorological balloon sent aloft at 1:00 am as having \\"started all the shooting\\" and concluded that \\"once the firing started, imagination created all kinds of targets in the sky and everyone joined in\\". In 1983, the U.S. Office of Air Force History attributed the event to a case of \\"war nerves\\" triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries. Background In the months following the Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on 7 December 1941, and the United States' entry into World War II the next day, public outrage and paranoia intensified across the country and especially on the West Coast of the United States, where fears of a Japanese attack on or invasion of the mainland were acknowledged as realistic possibilities. In Juneau, Alaska, residents were told to cover their windows for a nightly blackout after rumors spread that Japanese submarines were lurking along the southeast Alaskan coast.Juneau During WWII Panel The Empty Chair: The Forced Removal and Relocation of Juneau's Japanese, 1941‚Äì1951 Rumors that a Japanese aircraft carrier was cruising off the coast of the San Francisco Bay Area resulted in the city of Oakland closing its schools and issuing a blackout; civil defense sirens provided by Oakland Police Department cars blared through the city, and radio silence was ordered.Battle of Los Angeles The city of Seattle also imposed a blackout of all buildings and vehicles, and owners who left the lights on in their buildings had their businesses smashed by a mob of 2,000 residents. The rumors were taken so seriously that 500 United States Army troops moved into the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California, to defend the famed Hollywood facility and nearby factories against enemy sabotage or air attacks. As the United States began mobilizing for the war, anti-aircraft guns were installed, bunkers were built, and air raid precautions were drilled into the populace all over the country. Contributing to the paranoia was the fact that many American merchant ships were indeed attacked by Japanese submarines in waters off the West Coast, especially from the last half of December 1941 through February 1942: SS Agwiworld (escaped), (sank), SS Samoa (escaped), (sank), (damaged), SS H.M. Storey (escaped, sank later), SS Camden (sank), (damaged), (sank), SS Barbara Olson (escaped), SS Connecticut (damaged), and SS Idaho (minor damage).militarymuseum.org SS Agwiworldmilitarymuseum.org The Attacks on the SS Barbara Olson and SS Absoroka As the hysteria continued to mount, on 23 February 1942, at 7:15 pm, during one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats, surfaced near Santa Barbara, California, and shelled Ellwood Oil field in Goleta. Although damage was minimal (only $500 in property damage (equivalent to $ in ) and no injuries), the attack had a profound effect on the public imagination, as West Coast residents came to believe that the Japanese could storm their beaches at any moment. (Less than four months later, Japanese forces bombed Dutch Harbor in Unalaska, Alaska, and landed troops in the Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu). Alarms raised On 24 February 1942, U.S. Naval Intelligence issued a warning that an attack on mainland California could be expected within the next ten hours. That evening, many flares and blinking lights were reported from the vicinity of defense plants. An alert was called at 7:18 pm, and was lifted at 10:23 pm. Renewed activity began early in the morning of 25 February. Air raid sirens sounded at 2:25 am throughout Los Angeles County. A total blackout was ordered and thousands of air raid wardens were summoned to their positions. At 3:16 am, the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade began firing .50-caliber machine guns and anti-aircraft shells into the air at reported aircraft; over 1,400 shells were eventually fired. Pilots of the 4th Interceptor Command were alerted but their aircraft remained grounded. The artillery fire continued sporadically until 4:14 am. The \\"all clear\\" was sounded and the blackout order was lifted at 7:21 am. Several buildings and vehicles were damaged by shell fragments, and five civilians died as an indirect result of the anti-aircraft fire: three were killed in car accidents in the ensuing chaos and two of heart attacks attributed to the stress of the hour-long action. The incident was front-page news along the U.S. Pacific coast and across the nation. Press response Within hours of the end of the air raid, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox held a press conference, saying the entire incident had been a false alarm due to anxiety and \\"war nerves\\". Knox's comments were followed by statements from the Army the next dayLos Angeles Times, 27 February 1942 that reflected General George C. Marshall's supposition that the incident might have been caused by enemy agents using commercial airplanes in a psychological warfare campaign to generate panic. Some contemporary press outlets suspected a cover-up of the truth. An editorial in the Long Beach Independent wrote, \\"There is a mysterious reticence about the whole affair and it appears that some form of censorship is trying to halt discussion on the matter.\\" Speculation was rampant as to invading airplanes and their bases. Theories included a secret base in northern Mexico as well as Japanese submarines stationed offshore with the capability of carrying planes. Others speculated that the incident was either staged or exaggerated to give coastal defense industries an excuse to move further inland.Los Angeles Times, \\"Information, Please\\", 26 Feb. 1942, p. 1 Representative Leland Ford of Santa Monica called for a Congressional investigation, saying \\"none of the explanations so far offered removed the episode from the category of 'complete mystification' ... this was either a practice raid, or a raid to throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to lay a political foundation to take away Southern California's war industries.\\"Los Angeles Times, \\"Knox Assailed on 'False Alarm': West Coast legislators Stirred by Conflicting Air-Raid Statements\\" 27 Feb. 1942, p. 1 Attribution After the war ended in 1945, the Japanese government declared that they had flown no airplanes over Los Angeles during the war.The Battle of L.A. turns 75: When a panicked city fought a Japanese invasion that never happened Los Angeles Times. 25 February 2017. In 1983, the U.S. Office of Air Force History concluded that an analysis of the evidence points to meteorological balloons as the cause of the initial alarm: UFOlogy A photo published in the Los Angeles Times on 26 February 1942, has featured in UFO conspiracy theories as evidence of an extraterrestrial visitation. They assert that the photo clearly shows searchlights focused on an alien spaceship; however, the photo was heavily modified by photo retouching prior to publication, a routine practice in graphic arts of the time intended to improve contrast in black and white photos. Los Angeles Times writer Larry Harnisch noted that the retouched photo along with faked newspaper headlines were presented as true historical material in trailers for the 2011 film Battle: Los Angeles. Harnisch commented, \\"if the publicity campaign wanted to establish UFO research as nothing but lies and fakery, it couldn't have done a better job.\\" Commemoration Every February, the Fort MacArthur Museum, located at the entrance to Los Angeles Harbor, hosts an entertainment event called \\"The Great LA Air Raid of 1942\\".

The production stars Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple along with Arthur Kennedy, Muriel Pavlow, James Robertson Justice, and Stringer Davis (Rutherford's real- life husband). MGM made three sequels, Murder at the Gallop, Murder Most Foul and Murder Ahoy!, all with Rutherford starring as Miss Marple.  Plot While travelling by train, Miss Marple witnesses the strangling of a young woman in another train on a parallel track. The police find nothing to support her story, so she conducts her own investigation and, with the aid of her close friend Jim Stringer, comes to the conclusion that the body must have been thrown off the train near the grounds of Ackenthorpe Hall. Wheedling her way into a job as housekeeper, Miss Marple copes with her difficult employer, Luther Ackenthorpe, and searches for the missing corpse. She eventually finds it concealed in a stable, much to the chagrin of Police Inspector Craddock. Stringer uncovers the details of Ackenthorpe's will: the family fortune is to go to his long-suffering, attentive daughter Emma; his sons Cedric, Harold and Albert; and Alexander, his intelligent and insightful grandson. (A fourth son, Edmund, was killed in the war.) Also, Dr Quimper, Ackenthorpe's physician, and Emma are secretly in love. The gardener, Hillman, and the part-time servant Mrs Kidder round out the establishment and the list of suspects. Alexander finds the first clue, a musical compact that plays \\"Fr√®re Jacques\\", near where the body must have landed. When Emma reveals that she recently received a letter from a French woman named Martine, who claims that she married Edmund shortly before he died and is therefore an heir, the identity of the dead woman and the motive for the crime seem clear. Arsenic in the curried duck prepared by Miss Marple sickens all who eat it, but only Albert succumbs. Then Harold dies by his own shotgun. The police are unsure if it was suicide by a remorseful murderer or the third victim. Miss Marple, however, is not deceived, and sets a trap, using the compact as bait. Dr Quimper is revealed as the villain. The dead woman was not Martine at all, but his own wife. Quimper feared that the compact, a gift to his wife, could be traced to him. He intended to dispose of the other heirs and marry Emma. He administered a second, fatal dose of arsenic while supposedly attending to Albert. =Differences from the novel= As with most of her portrayals of Miss Marple, Margaret Rutherford's interpretation was quite different from Agatha Christie's. In addition, Agatha Christie's trademark suspense and underlying darkness are largely replaced by light, even whimsical touches typical of a comedy of manners. In the novel an elderly woman named Elspeth McGillicuddy witnesses the murder, not her friend Miss Marple, who is introduced later. Also in the novel a young acquaintance of Miss Marple's, not Miss Marple herself, is sent to pose as a housekeeper at the suspect location. The manor house where Miss Marple conducts her inquiries is called Rutherford Hall in the novel, but this was changed to Ackenthorpe Hall in the film to avoid using the leading actress's surname. Crackenthorpe, the family name in the novel, was shortened to Ackenthorpe.

They are perhaps most famous as the original songwriters and recorders of the song \\"Smoke Two Joints\\".\\"Smoke 2 Joints\\" from thetoyes.com It was originally recorded in 1983, and was re- released on their 1993 debut album The Toyes. It was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 American comedy-thriller film Homegrown. An influential version was recorded by the band Sublime; the song has since been mistakenly attributed to them or to Bob Marley. The Toyes also wrote and performed a song called \\"Monster Hash\\", a parody of Bobby \\"Boris\\" Pickett's \\"Monster Mash\\". The Toyes are composed of Mawg on Lead Vocals and Lead Guitar, B-dub on Vocals and Rhythm Guitar, John Trujillo on Vocals and Bass Guitar and Brian Rogers on Drums.  History  = Early Career (pre-1983)= Mawg (Jean-Christophe Kay) and his brother Sky (Michael Kay) were living together in Waikiki. Sky was working as a Pedi cab driver and Mawg was guitarist and vocalist in the Honolulu-based cover band, The Lifters. In fall of 1982, Mawg and Sky were entertaining friends who had arrived at the home to take in the finest local herb. While jamming a rootsy groove and improvising lyrics, the hook of \\"Smoke Two Joints\\" came tumbling out to the delight of the party guests. Seeing the response, Mawg and Sky completed the lyrics the following day while sitting under a large banyan tree on Kuhio Beach. Weeks later, Mawg performed the completed \\"Smoke Two Joints\\" with The Lifters. According to Mawg, \\"The crowd went wild and sang along. We played it 5 times that night after the crowd stopped our other songs in mid-performance by chanting 'Smoke Two Joints'.\\" The tune had become an instant sensation. Financed by their mother Paulette Kay, a French woman living in France, the Kay brothers immediately recorded the song and produced 500 45 RPM Vinyl discs. Joining them in the studio and rounding out the trio was 17-year-old Ricci Accardi, a local drummer. Having quit The Lifters, Mawg, Sky and Ricci joined up with singer Mike Dawson to form Tightrope, which they later renamed The Toys. In late 1983 The Toys received a Cease and Desist letter from Motown Records' legal department threatening a lawsuit over the use of the name \\"The Toys\\", who were a signed act of Motown and who recorded \\"A Lover's Concerto\\". Wanting to avoid costly litigation with the recording giant, the brothers decided to add an \\"e\\" to their name, becoming The Toyes. =\\"Smoke Two Joints\\" Success= On December 2, 1982, Mawg, Sky and Ricci went into modest Audio-Media Studios in downtown Honolulu to record ‚ÄúSmoke Two Joints‚Äù and a hastily made-up jam song, ‚ÄúBig Fat Mama‚Äù. The sessions were produced by Mawg and Sky and engineered by the house recording engineer at Audio-Media, Ed Roy. The songs were recorded and mixed that same day, and the master was quickly sent to a vinyl pressing plant on the mainland Hawaii. Mawg distributed the 45s at clothing stores, gift shops and convenience stores, as well as making the record available for sale at their live shows. The record soon found its way into the hands of Andy Preston, the Music Director at 98 Rock KPOI-FM, Oahu‚Äôs top rock station and was featured in the station‚Äôs 5:00 PM feature ‚ÄúTop 5 at 5‚Äù. That month ‚ÄúSmoke Two Joints‚Äù usurped Michael Jackson and Journey as the #1 most requested song and held that position for ten months. KFOG in San Francisco picked up the song and made it a staple @ 5:00 p.m. every Friday afternoon as the weekend send-off. The Toyes followed up their 45 RPM single by recording three more songs which were released as a 12\\" vinyl EP featuring \\"Smoke Two Joints\\", \\"Listen to the Radio\\", which was released as a second single and received moderate air play in Hawaii, \\"Never Wanna Go\\", which is the only Toyes track sung by Mike Dawson, as well as Mawg's solo acoustic guitar composition \\"Eddie's Theme\\". The Toyes went on the road to support the new album touring the Hawaiian Islands and Guam. Marijuana Advocacy The Toyes are well known for their advocacy of the legalization of marijuana. Aside from \\"Monster Hash\\" and \\"Smoke Two Joints\\" The Toyes have recorded \\"Hey, Uncle Sam ...(Leave us Pot Smokers Alone)\\" and the Medical Marijuana anthem \\"Green Doctor\\".

Built in 1898 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the twelve members of the class entered service during the first five months of 1899. Eight were withdrawn by the end of 1935, while four others survived with new boilers until the mid-1950s. History In the late 1890s, New Zealand's national network was expanding at a great rate and demand for services on existing lines was rising. However, the size of the locomotive fleet was inadequate to handle the demand - this was at least in part due to the economic difficulties created by the Long Depression. The New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) had built the WA class in its own workshops, but desperate for more engines, went shopping overseas for more. High prices and workers' strikes in England meant that the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Pennsylvania was contacted in 1898 to provide twelve locomotives built to similar specifications as the WA class. Delivery was swift and the locomotives entered service between January and May 1899. Although initially classified as WA, they were re-classified WB in 1900‚Äì01 to avoid any confusion with the earlier locomotives constructed in New Zealand. Operation Most were initially based at Wanganui's East Town depot, but two each went to Wellington and Westport and one to Whangarei. By World War I, they were equally distributed between Westport and Whangarei. In their early years, WB locomotives ran all kinds of trains from their main base in Wanganui - the prestigious New Plymouth Mail passenger express, goods trains to Napier and through the Wairarapa, and local mixed trains of passengers and freight from Wanganui to HƒÅwera and Palmerston North. Within a few years, more powerful locomotives displaced the WB class from many of these services and they were sent to join their classmates in Westport and Whangarei. On the isolated Westport section, the dominant traffic was coal from the various inland mines served by rail, and the WBs worked these services for a number of decades until they were displaced in the 1950s by the WW class. During their years of operation, the WB class was seen as ideal for operations on the lines that fanned out from Westport, and four were overhauled and given new boilers in the mid-1920s to prolong their lives. Withdrawal The first withdrawals of WB class locomotives occurred in the late 1920s, when Whangarei-based WB 301 was retired in March 1928. By the end of 1932, all six WBs that had been based in Whangarei were withdrawn - they were 290, 293, 295, 296, 297, and 301. In Westport, the two that did not receive new boilers were withdrawn around the same time: WB 291 ceased operations in December 1931 and was followed by WB 294 in May 1935. Until the Westport section was linked to the national network in 1943, the remaining four had secure roles; although members of the superior WW class had been introduced to Westport in 1929‚Äì30, they did not arrive in sufficient quantities to seriously displace the WBs until the opening of the Stillwater - Westport Line. During the 1940s, the extent of the operations of the WBs decreased markedly, and by 1955, they were little more than shunters in Westport's yard. In the second half of 1955, WB 298 and WB 300 were withdrawn, and during the next year, the final two, 292 and 299, were removed from service, though they were not officially withdrawn until January 1957. WB 300 was towed to Dunedin to be scrapped, but this was not an economical procedure and the other three were dumped in two Westland rivers to stabilise river banks and halt erosion. WB 298 was dismantled in Westport and its boiler was dumped at the \\"locomotive graveyard\\" in Omoto, near Greymouth, while in 1958, WB 292 was taken to Seddonville and toppled into Coal Creek. Eventually, it was joined by WB 299 on 1 January 1960. Preservation Inspired by the recovery of locomotives from riverbeds such as K 88 from the Oreti River in Southland, the Baldwin Steam Trust was established to recover WB 292 and WB 299 from their resting place near Seddonville. The Seddonville Branch between Seddonville and Mokihinui Mine had closed in 1974, and by the late 1980s, nature had grown over the old formation and there were no roads within a mile of where the two locomotives lay. Nonetheless, a plan was formulated and in mid-1989, the engines were successfully recovered. The Baldwin Steam Trust ultimately plans to restore both locomotives back to full operational condition. 292 & 299 are stored at the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust's Maymorn depot awaiting restoration. * Wb292 Baldwin No. 16172 of 1898 * Wb299 Baldwin No. 16175 of 1898 References  Bibliography   External links *The Baldwin Steam Trust *NZR Baldwin Locomotives Wb class Category:2-6-2T locomotives Category:Baldwin locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1898 Category:3 ft 6 in gauge locomotives of New Zealand ","title":"NZR WB class"},{"id":"3672039","text":"Assistant Secretary is a title borne by politicians or government officials in certain countries, usually a junior ministers assigned to a specific Cabinet minister. Australia The rank of Assistant Secretary denotes a high level government official who is positioned in the Government of Australia. The position falls under the Australian Public Service Act 1999, and holds the level of Senior Executive Service (SES) Level Band 1. The position also holds several other titles such as: Branch Head, National Manager, Group Manager, and Executive Director. For those officials who hold diplomatic status and are positioned in Australian High Commissions or Embassies at the Assistant Secretary Level hold the following titles: Regional Director, Minister- Counsellor, and Ambassador. However, although most offshore Australian diplomatic staff at these levels are SES Band 1, some are SES Band 2. The median annual reward wage for a baseline Assistant Secretary level is $219,464 (AUD), excluding bonuses, superannuation or fringe benefits. Hong Kong An Assistant Secretary is a middle to senior official facilitating the work of the top officials, and is the subject officer for a specific policy domain among bureaux and departments. The position of Assistant Secretary belongs to the Administrative Officer Grade in the Hong Kong Civil Service originated from the colonial Administrative Service since 1862, being a cadet of multi- disciplined professional city administrators. As the top-calibre generalists in the government, they are the central policy-making and coordinating body in the Hong Kong Civil Service. The annual rate of pay for a baseline Assistant Secretary is pitched at Point 27 of the Master Pay Scale ($78,310 (USD) or $610,800 (HKD)) and will go up to Point 49 of the Master Pay Scale ($191,200 (USD) or $1,491,360 (HKD)). The grade has an established tradition of academic aristocracy. Over the 80 years between 1862, when the recruitment scheme was started, and the Japanese invasion of 1941, the majority of the cadets were educated at Oxford and Cambridge, although a substantial contingent (about 30 per cent) came from universities in Ireland and Scotland. India From 1919 to 1945, the permanent posts of Assistant Secretary were filled by officers drawn from the Imperial Secretariat Service during the British Raj. Currently, the temporary position of Assistant Secretary is occupied by the officers of the Indian Administrative Service during their training period in Ministries of Central Government, as Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions has temporarily excluded section officers from Central Secretariat Service, which is later reverted. Ireland The grade of Assistant Secretary is a position in the Irish Civil Service, which uses a nearly identical grading scheme to its British counterpart. It may now be alternatively styled, depending on the department or office. The Netherlands An Assistant Secretary (in Dutch: \\"staatssecretaris\\") assists a specific minister. He is responsible for a specific domain (i.e., one or more important issues that require special attention‚Äîhe assistant secretary can thus alleviate the minister's burden) and may be held accountable for his political actions, which means that he must resign once he has lost the support of the parliament. Not every department has an assistant secretary; whether one is installed depends on the importance of the department. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the position of Assistant Secretary is a grade in the British Civil Service, now more commonly styled Divisional Manager or Deputy Director. In the grading scheme they are denoted Grade 5 (with basic salary starting at ¬£65,422 as of August 2014). United States In the United States, the rank of Assistant Secretary denotes a high level civilian official within the United States federal government. An official of sub-Cabinet rank, Assistant Secretaries are appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and are assigned to assist a specific Cabinet Secretary. Assistant Secretaries often manage major programs administered by a Cabinet Department. Assistant Secretaries are generally the lowest level \\"Secretarial\\" positions appointed directly by the President. Assistant Secretaries are generally Level IV positions within the Executive Schedule, ranking below the position of Under Secretary. Since January 2010, the annual rate of pay for Level III is $155,500.

Despite being recorded and finished by 1986, Factory Records didn't release the album until 1988, by which time the band were virtually forgotten. Factory also mis-handled the launch of the album's first single (quoting from the Section 25 biography): :The single (FAC 157) did not appear until May 1987, and was marred by further disaster. Priming a joke that misfired badly, Factory's publicists informed trade paper Music Week that the new SXXV single was a cover of a 1965 hit - \\"Good News Week\\" - by industry pundit Jonathan King. King's publishers Jonjo wasted no time in claiming that the Section 25 composition was an unauthorised pastiche of the earlier song, and that the first five lines of the lyrics infringed the copyright. The dispute was swiftly settled by the MCPS, but not before all copies of FAC 157 had been recalled by the distributor, and Section 25 obliged to sign over 100% of the publishing to Jonjo Music and Jonathan King. New Order slipped in similar fashion two years later, having apparently borrowed chunks of \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" by John Denver for their own song \\"Run...\\". Truth is indeed often stranger than fiction. Angered by Factory for numerous reasons, the band included '17 Alternative Titles' on the album's sleeve (however, there are only 14). LTM Recordings reissued the album in 1999 with a number of bonus tracks. It was also renamed Love & Hate (In the English Countryside), but the album is still referred to by its original issue name.

Black Samuel Wylie Black (September 3, 1816 - June 27, 1862) was a lawyer, soldier, judge, and politician. A Democrat closely involved in Pennsylvania politics, he is best known for being the 7th Governor of the Nebraska Territory and for being killed in action leading his regiment in a charge early in the Civil War. Youth The son of Rev. John Black, a Covenanter preacher, John Brown Wylie Black was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 3, 1816. He was the sixth of nine children. Black and his father exhibited great love for each other, as seen in letters written in later years, but the younger Black had a rebellious streak as well. When he was told by his father that the circus was a wicked place and threatened with a thrashing if he went to it, Sam reflected and then replied, \\"I've decided. I will go to the circus and take the thrashing.\\" In contrast to his dour father's strict discipline and devout faith, Sam never joined the church and was known for his pranks and good humor. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania, known today as the University of Pittsburgh, in 1834. While at the university, he was a classmate, academic rival, and close friend of Thomas Mellon. After graduation, Black studied the law with Richard Biddle, a former member of Congress, and perhaps as well with Judge Thomas Mifflin Irwin, both a former member of Congress and a federal judge. Black was admitted to the bar in 1838 and married Irwin's daughter Eliza soon after. Career in the Law Sam Black and Thomas Mellon, who had been admitted to the bar the year before, became professional rivals almost immediately. Both were bright, ambitious, and successful. Their rivalry, however, stemmed from differing approaches to the law as well as personality. Black was eloquent, impulsive, and passionate, and not afraid to captivate and misdirect a jury. In contrast, Mellon took a more studious approach. He spoke less expressively but tried to let the facts win an argument. Mellon found, however, that he could best counter Black's eloquence with ridicule, and after an exchange in open court that led to an outbreak of temper from both men, their friendship turned to hostility. The enmity only ended on the eve of the Mexican War when Black sought out Mellon to renew the friendship, saying \\"Mellon, let us make it up! I may never see you again.\\" Their rekindled alliance lasted until Black's death. Mexican War Black served as lieutenant-colonel of the First Pennsylvania Volunteers during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After Colonel Francis W. Wynkoop left the regiment to become Governor of the military district of Perote, Black took command of the First Pennsylvania Infantry. Late in the war, anxious to fight, Black became furious when the First Pennsylvania was ordered by General Winfield Scott to remain in the city of Puebla to protect a garrison, while the army began its final assault on Mexico City. Black appealed the decision to no avail and then offered his resignation. General Scott refused to accept it, but assured Black that he would still have opportunity to see action. Scott was correct. On September 14, 1847, the same day that Mexico City fell, the garrison of fewer than 500 soldiers, not including 1,800 sick and wounded, at Puebla was surrounded by 4,000 Mexican soldiers. General Joaqu√≠n Rea, under orders of General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, commanded a force of regular soldiers and guerrillas. The American force held three strongpoints within the city: a convent, Fort Loretto, and the citadel of San Jos√©. The full garrison was under command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Childs, and Lieutenant-Colonel Black was placed in charge of the citadel of San Jos√©, which also served as a temporary hospital. The siege lasted for 28 days, during which it was under a constant barrage of bullets. After several weeks, the divided garrison came close to running out of food. When news of the siege reached General Scott, he ordered Brigadier General Joseph Lane to lead a relief force to save Puebla. On October 9, the federal force reached Huamantla, a small city 25 miles from Puebla where the bulk of Santa Anna's force was waiting. After Santa Anna's army was defeated at the Battle of Huamantla, Lane's troops were able to disperse the remnant of the siege force surrounding Puebla, fight their way into the city, and lift the siege. Childs praised Black for his leadership during the siege with these words, \\"From Lieutenant-Colonel Black, the immediate commander of San Jose, and his officers, I have received the most cordial support. Colonel Black, for more than thirty days, was untiring in his efforts and zeal for the safety of that point. Officers and men were at the posts night and day, without regarding the pelting storm; and I cannot say too much in praise of the gallant colonel, his officers and men, before and during the siege.\\" Political career A lifelong Democrat, Black ran and lost in 1852 for Representative from Pennsylvania to the U.S. House. He moved to Nebraska and in 1857 was appointed United States Judge of the Nebraska Territory by President James Buchanon. He was appointed Governor of the Nebraska Territory in 1859. His most controversial action as governor was to veto on January 9, 1860, the Act to Prohibit Slavery. He was accused of being a pro-South Democrat, but Black claimed he believed the wording of the bill was unconstitutional. The territorial legislature overrode the veto, and slavery was outlawed in Nebraska. When Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected President, Democrat Sam Black resigned. There is no evidence of specific pressure exerted on him to resign, but territorial governorships were a hallmark of the patronage system of the era, and Black was part of the system. He resigned in February (before Lincoln took office), but seems to have stayed in Nebraska until June, 1861, when Black returned home to Pittsburgh. Civil War thumb Black returned to Pittsburgh to take command of the Union Army's 62nd Pennsylvania Infantry made up of three-year volunteers, the first to leave the city to fight in the Civil War. Black was an eager commander, who died early in the war. During the Peninsula Campaign, the Sixty Second Pennsylvania Infantry was part of Charles Griffin's brigade of George W. Morell's division of the V Corps. Having led his regiment as part of a counter-offensive that turned the tide of the Battle of Hanover Court House, Black went on to distinguish himself at the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek on June 26, 1862, leading his regiment with that fervor and enthusiasm as they held their position. At the Battle of Gaines's Mill, the following day, Morrell's division had the left of the line, where a slope reached down to the Chickahominy, and Griffin's brigade saw action as the battle opened by the advance of Longstreet's corps on their flank. The Sixty-second Pennsylvania and the Ninth Massachusetts were ordered to advance and charged across a ravine to their front. They gained the woods on the opposite side, but while making the charge, before reaching the woods, Colonel Black was killed.

Biography Henry Booth was born in Rodney Street, Liverpool, England,, a descendant of the Booths of Twemlow. His father, Thomas, was the son of a yeoman farmer of Orford, Cheshire. Thomas and his brother George apprenticed to corn merchant Dobson in 1767, and 1774 began business as corn factors on the own account at 17 King Street, Liverpool. As eldest son of it was expected Henry would follow his father in that business and was sent to a Dr. Shepherd, a Presbyterian minister in the nearby village of Gateacre for instruction. He showed an aptitude for reading books, poetry, practical mechanics and was noted for a good eye for proportion. Henry initially found employment in his father's business before branching out with this own corn merchant business, being noted for not being particularly successful. =1820-1830 building the railway= Booth's father Thomas had been an original member of the L&M; project original provisional committee in 1822. Henry later replaced his father and quickly became noted for organisational and promotional skills and enthusiasm for the endeavour which was to an extent stalling by 1823 and least in part due to the difficulties and over-commitment of William James. Appointed as committee secretary and noted as becoming second only to Joseph Saunders in commitment to the project Booth was one of the four members of a working party sent to visit other railways at Bedlington Ironworks, Killingworth and Hetton colliery, returning with a report recommending steam locomotive haulage for the L&M.; A meeting of 20 May 1824 accepted the report but also took the steps to forming a Joint Stock Company, Booth writing the prospectus which was issued on 29 October 1824. 1825 saw Booth give up his corn merchant interests to concentrate on the L&M; project. On 29 May 1826 following the achievement of enabling act for the L&M; a meeting of subscribers Booth was appointed treasurer at a salary of ¬£500 a year. He was to continue competently fulfilling the posts of Treasurer, Secretary and later General Manager for the life of the L&M.; The original enabling act for the L&M; was defeated in parliament in 1825, George Stephenson performing badly. Stephenson was more of a self-taught rather than formally trained civil engineer and his situation was not helped my some of his subordinate engineers have made significant errors in the submission which were picked up on. With Booth had requested no scapegoats were made one of the engineers committed suicide. The L&M; use the Rennie brothers for a further submission to built the railway in 1826, the revised presentation focused on use of stationary engines with mobile locomotives only to be considered if their technology improved. With focus away from locomotives and the pro- stationary engine Rennies involved the enabling bill passed in 1826. With the bill passed booth, Saunders and other pro-locomotive directors replaced the Rennies recalling George Stephenson to build the railway, much to the Rennies' chargin. =Rainhill and Rocket= As the building of the railway continued toward conclusion the board was split as whether to use stationary engines or mobile locomotives particularly over the significant inclines around Rainhill. Booth was in favour of locomotive haulage however locomotives being built were mostly orientated towards freight haulage to and from mines and not for higher speed passenger work. The single flue design used my locomotives was one of the constraints to raising steam due to the limited heating surface between the hot tubes and water in the boiler. That this understood was indicated by the reverse flue in Hawkworth's Royal George, the most powerful locomotive of the time, which reversed the main flue. Booth and the L&MR; board initially gave the Stephensons ¬£100 to experiment with a multi-tube boiler, however the result was not successful. Lancashire Witch, which was initially to have had a multi-tube boiler eventually emerged with a single main flue and two subsidiary flues. On 20 April 1829 the board of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway project passed a resolution for a competition to be held to prove their railway could be reliably operated by steam locomotives, there being advice from eminent engineers of the age that stationary engines would be required. A prize of ¬£500 was offered as an incentive to the winner, with strict conditions a locomotive would need to meet to enter the trial. Booth and the Stephens partnered to produce a premium engine with a multi-tube boiler that was to become Stephenson's Rocket and which was to win the Rainhill Trials in October 1829. There are suggestions it was who Booth proposed the basic design of the first multi-tubular boiler as used on Stephenson's Rocket steam locomotive built in late 1829 for the L&M; Railway. The first record of Booth first referring to \\"method of producing steam without smoke\\", or the multi-tube boiler, occurs in the Minutes of an L&M; board meeting in the Spring of 1827. Marc Seguin of France also has claims to the invention. =1831-1845 Liverpool and Manchester operations= Booth was the Company treasurer of the L&M; for the 15 years of whole of its operating life, the railway taking over from the Stockton and Darlington as the model to be followed. Especially in the early years pioneering years challenges arose and had to be overcome. Booths contributions to the railway continued to be recognised with his salary being increased from ¬£750 to ¬£1,000 in 1834 and four years later to ¬£1,500. Even though treasurer Booth made some technical contributions to the railway including lubrication of certain parts of locomotives using grease rather than oil. Booth is also connected with the use of buffers for the coach rolling stock, even having to account to parliament on the matter in 1832 and introducing and devised an arrangement with an additional set of springs with double hanging shackles for first class coaches. Booth was a leading proponent of working all British railways to one standard time. =After the merger= Memorial to Booth in Ullet Road Unitarian Church. On the formation of the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) on 16 July 1846, he became a director of the new large company, serving until 18 May 1859. He also served as the company secretary for the LNWR's Northern Division for a year, being the first person to do so. Inventions Booth is credited with the invention of the screw coupling, with a statue of him holding one displayed in St George's Hall, Liverpool.

Biography Humphry Marshall House in Marshallton, now a National Historic Landmark Humphry Marshall was born at Derbydown Homestead in the village of Marshallton, Pennsylvania (within West Bradford Township) on October 10, 1722. Note: This includes He was the cousin of botanists John Bartram and William Bartram. Like many early American botanists, he was a Quaker. Marshall received the rudiments of an English education, and was apprenticed to the business of a stonemason, which trade he subsequently followed. Soon after his marriage in 1748 to Sarah Pennock he took charge of his father's farm, and about that time began to devote his attention to astronomy and natural history, building a small observatory in one corner of his residence.American Philosophical Society Archives. Appleton's entry is incorrect. He specialized early in native plants, after gaining his enthusiasm for botany from John Bartram. In 1767 he came into the possession of the family estate, and in 1773 he created a botanical garden at Marshallton with both native and exotic plants. This was the second in the United States, the first having been established by John Bartram. As late as 1849, many of the plants still survived, although neglect had turned the garden into a mere wilderness. In 1785, Marshall published \\"Arbustrum Americanum: The American Grove, an Alphabetical Catalogue of Forest Trees and Shrubs, Natives of the American United States\\" (Philadelphia). For many years, he was the treasurer for Chester County and trustee of the public loan office. In 1768, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, and he was a member of other scientific societies. Marshall's first wife died in 1786; he married Margaret Minshall in 1788. He had no children by either wife. In his later years, he was partly blinded by cataracts. Marshall died on November 5, 1801. In 1848 the Borough of West Chester named the public square the Marshall Square in his honor. Legacy Marshall has been called the \\"Father of American Dendrology\\". A genus of plants, Marshallia, was named in honor of Humphry Marshall and his nephew Moses Marshall, also a botanist. Marshall Square Park in the Borough of West Chester, Pennsylvania, is four miles east of Marshallton where Humphry Marshall was born; the Park's founders named the square after their 18th century predecessor.

British coffee cake is typically a sponge cake flavored with coffee, typically baked in a circular shape with two layers separated by coffee butter icing, which also covers the top of the cake. Walnuts are a common addition, to make coffee and walnut cake. In the United States, coffee cake generally refers to a sweet cake intended to be eaten with coffee or tea (like tea cake). The American variety is presented in a single layer, flavoured with either fruit or cinnamon, and leavened with either baking soda (or baking powder), which results in a more cake-like texture, or yeast, which results in a more bread-like texture. They may be loaf-shaped, for easy slicing or baked in a Bundt or tube pan. History Coffee cake‚Äîalso referred to as gugelhupf or kaffekuchen‚Äîevolved from other sweet dishes from Vienna. In the 17th century, Northern/Central Europeans are thought to have come up with the idea of eating sweet cakes while drinking coffee. As the region's countries were already known for their sweet yeast breads, the introduction of coffee in Europe led to the understanding that cakes were a great complement to the beverage. Immigrants from countries such as Germany and Scandinavia adjusted their recipes to their own liking and brought them to America. Though the cakes varied, they all contained ingredients such as yeast, flour, dried fruit, and sweet spices. However, over time, the coffee cake recipes have changed as cheese, sugared fruit, yogurt, sour cream, have been used, leading to a denser, more cake-like structure. In the 19th century, American cooks also used coffee as an ingredient to thriftily use up leftovers, reducing waste, and flavor the cake. The invention of pasteurization in America following World War I also led to the creation of a new kind of coffee cake, called sour cream coffee cake. Coffee cake is referenced in literary material as early as 1850 with references to gugelhupf going back to 1763. Varieties =American coffee cake= German women brought the concept of the kaffeeklatsch to America. Contemporary coffee cakes in the US rarely contain coffee. Most are simple, singularly flavoured cakes that feature fruit, spices, or nuts. They may also feature a streusel or simple glaze topping, if any. Streusel is German for \\"sprinkle\\" or \\"strew\\" and refers to the popular crumbly topping of butter, flour, sugar. A variety of crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) contains flour, sugar, butter, cinnamon granules, and sometimes oats or nuts, which are sprinkled over the coffee cake batter before it is baked. Sour cream is also sometimes used in traditional American coffee cakes to both add a tart flavor and activate baking soda used as a leavening agent. =Applesauce cake= Applesauce cake is sometimes prepared and served alongside coffee. =Arany galuska= In Hungary, there is a type of coffee cake called arany galuska containing walnuts and cinnamon.

Loosely inspired by the Vietnam War,https://www.songfacts.com/facts/deep-purple/child- in-time - Running 10 minutes and 15 seconds, this is a protest song to the United States' war in Vietnam. The lyrics were written by lead singer Ian Gillan.] it is featured on the band's 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock and runs for over 10 minutes. History and characteristics Deep Purple's Ian Gillan has said that \\"Child in Time\\" is based on It's a Beautiful Day's psychedelic song \\"Bombay Calling\\". It's a Beautiful Day in return borrowed Purple's \\"Wring That Neck\\" and turned it into \\"Don and Dewey\\" on their second album Marrying Maiden (1970). As Ian Gillan put it in a 2002 interview, \\"There are two sides to that song - the musical side and the lyrical side. On the musical side, there used to be this song 'Bombay Calling' by a band called It's A Beautiful Day. It was fresh and original, when Jon was one day playing it on his keyboard. It sounded good, and we thought we'd play around with it, change it a bit and do something new keeping that as a base. But then, I had never heard the original 'Bombay Calling'. So, we created this song using the Cold War as the theme, and wrote the lines 'Sweet child in time, you'll see the line.' That's how the lyrical side came in. Then, Jon had the keyboard parts ready and Ritchie had the guitar parts ready. The song basically reflected the mood of the moment, and that's why it became so popular.\\" With themes of war and inhumanity, the song is regarded as a heavy metal anthem and an example of art rock. A staple of the Deep Purple live concerts in 1970‚Äì73 and later after their initial reunion tours of 1985 and 1987‚Äì88, the song was not featured regularly at concerts after 1995. It was re-added to the setlist for the band's 2002 European tour, with its final appearance in Deep Purple's live set was at Kharkiv's Opera Theatre's scene in March of that year. A live version later appeared on the 1972 live album Made in Japan. Another live version can be found on the Scandinavian Nights / Live in Stockholm live album, recorded in September 1970. Gillan also featured a live jazz influenced version of the song in his Ian Gillan Band project of the late 1970s.

Although the process can be applied to any type of liquid at any vapor pressure, it is generally used to describe the boiling of water by lowering the container's internal pressure below standard atmospheric pressure and causing the water to boil at room temperature. The vacuum evaporation treatment process consists of reducing the interior pressure of the evaporation chamber below atmospheric pressure. This reduces the boiling point of the liquid to be evaporated, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for heat in both the boiling and condensation processes. There are other advantages, such as the ability to distill liquids with high boiling points and avoiding decomposition of substances that are heat sensitive. Food When the process is applied to food and the water is evaporated and removed, the food can be stored for long periods without spoiling. It is also used when boiling a substance at normal temperatures would chemically change the consistency of the product, such as egg whites coagulating when attempting to dehydrate the albumen into a powder. This process was invented by Henri Nestl√© in 1866, of Nestl√© Chocolate fame, although the Shakers were already using a vacuum pan before that (see condensed milk). This process is used industrially to make such food products as evaporated milk for milk chocolate and tomato paste for ketchup.

Thin film deposition Vacuum evaporation is also a form of physical vapor deposition used in the semiconductor, microelectronics, and optical industries and in this context is a process of depositing thin films of material onto surfaces. Such a technique consists of pumping a vacuum chamber to pressures of less than 10‚àí5 torr and heating a material to produce a flux of vapor to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its vapor pressure is high enough to produce a flux of several Angstroms per second by using an electrically resistive heater or bombardment by a high voltage beam.

Operating mostly in the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo along the border with Rwanda, it carried out attacks throughout the Second Congo War against forces aligned with Rwanda and Uganda. In 2000, the ALiR agreed to merge with the Hutu resistance movement based in Kinshasa into the new Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). ALiR was largely supplanted by the FDLR by 2001.  History  The killing during the 1994 Rwandan genocide was largely carried out by the national army, the Armed Forces of Rwanda (FAR) and the paramilitary Interahamwe. Following the invasion of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) led by Paul Kagame, many FAR and Interahamwe fled across the border into Zaire. During the resulting Great Lakes refugee crisis, these two groups combined into the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALIR). The increased intensity of cross-border attacks by the ALIR led the Rwandan government to secretly arm the ethnically Tutsi Banyamulenge and organize the creation of a proxy rebel group, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), led by Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila. The AFDL invaded Zaire in late 1996 in what became known as the First Congo War. The AFDL and their Rwandan and Ugandan allies forced the refugees back into Rwanda and scattering the RDR fighters to countries such as Zambia, Angola, Congo-Brazzaville, the Central African Republic, Chad, Sudan, Burundi and Tanzania. The AFDL continued on to Kinshasa, overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko and installing Kabila as president on 17 May 1997. Kabila then announced that the name of the country was being changed from Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While Kabila was completing his rebellion, the ALIR remnants reformed and recruited new Hutu fighters from eastern Zaire. Army for the Liberation of Rwanda become active in eastern Zaire by early 1997. The ALiR's political wing, the Party for the Liberation of Rwanda (PALIR), maintained the old goal of overthrowing the Kagame government and regaining power, to which it added the objective of expelling the foreign invaders, thereby giving it more appeal to local populations. There were also concerns that it intended to continue the genocide against the Tutsis. Even before regaining a military presence, a letter allegedly sent by the ALiR threatened to kill the American ambassador to Rwanda and other U.S. citizens in retaliation for support to Rwanda. By July 1998, the alliance between Kabila and his Rwandan and Ugandan sponsors had broken down. Kabila ordered the foreign forces out of the country, prompting Rwanda and Uganda to create another rebel group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), to overthrow Kabila in the Second Congo War. Kabila then began to provide military support to ALiR, many members of which he had tried to kill less than two years previously, in order to weaken the RCD and foreign military forces in eastern Congo. As the war grew into the most deadly conflict since the Second World War, several thousand ALiR fought carried out guerrilla attacks behind the front lines. In 1999, eight tourists from the U.S., United Kingdom and New Zealand and a Ugandan game warden were killed while in Uganda's Bwindi National Park, along the border with the DRC. The tourists were tracking rare mountain gorillas and were apparently targeted as English language speakers. One captured French diplomat was released with a message condemning the U.S. and UK for their support of Rwanda. The act of violence largely destroyed Uganda's tourist industry for years. For the next several years, the battle lines stabilized and the war stagnated as Uganda and Rwanda competed to extract resources from the rich mines and forests of eastern Congo that they occupied. The ALiR continued to carry out attacks upon both opposing armed groups, as well as civilian populations that they thought supported their enemies. Following Kabila's assassination on 18 January 2001 and the rise of his son Joseph, the ALiR consolidated forces with a Kinshasa- based Hutu group to form the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). While never officially disbanded, ALiR lost its separate identity under the FDLR. Despite official declarations from the FDLR that they have given up armed resistance, groups descended from ALiR continue to fight in eastern Congo.

Format and history =2002‚Äì2010= Xplosion was launched on November 27, 2002, as TNA's only regular cable show, featuring exclusive matches from the TNA Asylum, as well as exclusive interviews with all the TNA Wrestling personalities. On November 18, 2004, the show was revamped as a recap of the previous week's Impact! in light of alterations in the taping schedule. However, Xplosion resumed airing exclusive matches (billed as \\"Xplosion Xclusives\\") once more on October 7, 2005, in addition to recapping Impact!. The \\"Xplosion Xclusives\\" also aired on the now-ceased internet show TNA Global Impact!. All matches seen on Xplosion were taped alongside Impact!. Matches normally featured wrestlers who rarely appeared on Impact!. Occasionally, wrestlers may have made their debut or return on Xplosion and angles also took place. Airings of Xplosion in the United States ceased at the end of 2006, although some of the exclusive matches could be seen on TNA Today. Starting on December 22, 2008, \\"Xplosion Xclusive\\" matches were also streamed on the TNA's website and YouTube channel. =2010‚Äì2014= The show was revamped at the June 14, 2010, tapings of the 300th episode of Xplosion, featuring more original matches instead of a highlight show, with Jeremy Borash and Mike Tenay on commentary. In addition to the format changes, Xplosion received a new logo, graphics package and theme music performed by Taproot. Xplosion also features the Spin Cycle, where Borash had a Q&A; session with various TNA stars in front of a live crowd. In 2013, TNA began including matches from the early years of TNA and matches prior to the upcoming TNA PPV.

The show was reformatted with families in mind, as it aired on Saturday mornings in the UK. It was still hosted by Jeremy Borash and features a mix of new and classic matches. The Spin Cycle segment also returned for a time. = 2017‚Äìpresent = In early 2017, TNA changed its name to Impact Wrestling; and to reflect this change, the show gradually became known as simply Xplosion (instead of TNA Xplosion) - with the TNA logo rarely featuring in archived footage. It later was renamed Impact Xplosion. On October 10, 2017, Impact Wrestling launched its streaming service, the Global Wrestling Network (now Impact Plus), with Xplosion as one of its programs. This made the program available in the US for the first time since 2006.

He was born in Feltre but spent most of his life working in Milan. The story as it has circulated through the centuries in Feltre is that Castaldi was given examples of early Chinese block printing by Marco Polo,Marco Polo died in 1324, however. with which he experimented, eventually producing modern type. The story was largely unknown outside of Lombardy until it was reported in the 19th century by Robert Curzon, Baron Zouche, a diplomat. As Curzon tells it, Castaldi began with glass stamps made at Murano and eventually developed wooden printing blocks which he used in a printing press in Venice in 1426.Curzon, Robert. \\"A Short Account of Libraries in Italy,\\" pp. 6ff. Quoted in Henri Cordier's annotations to Marco Polo (Yule, Henry; Cordier, Henri, The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition, reprint by Dover, 1993), 138. This would have been several years before Johann Gutenberg's first experiments with metal type in the early 1430s. Curzon stresses the connection to Marco Polo, arguing that Castaldi's (undated) early work closely resembles Chinese printing, and also stresses Gutenberg's acquaintance with Venetian printing, thus suggesting that European printing did not emerge distinctly from the Chinese analogues but in imitation (a frequently debated question in any case).Cordier, 139-140. Since no more recent scholarship has suggested such an early date for Castaldi's printing, any relationship between Castaldi and Marco Polo,Cordier, 140. or any connection between Gutenberg and Northern Italy, the story has never received much credit outside of Feltre. In that city, however, it still attracts a fair amount of attention (the statue of Castaldi still stands) and was brought up once again on the occasion of Castaldi's sexcentennial in 1998; in a proposal for a municipal bill recognizing Castaldi, he was referred to as \\"il primo inventore dei caratteri mobili per la stampa\\" (\\"the first inventor of moveable type for printing\\").http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg13/lavori/stampati/sk4000/relazion/3791.htm. What is clear is that by the 1470s Castaldi was a successful printer; there is a record of a print run of 300 copies of a Cicero epistle in 1471.Richardson, Brian. Printing, Writers and Readers in Renaissance Italy (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 30. Panfilo Castaldi is the imprint of a 19th and 20th-century printing house in Feltre.

The conflict culminated on 13 October 1990, when the Syrian Army stormed Baabda Palace and other strongholds of Aoun, killing hundreds of Lebanese soldiers and civilians and ousting Aoun, marking the end of the Lebanese Civil War.  Background  The Lebanese Civil War began in 1975, and in 1976 Syria began an occupation of parts of Lebanon. In 1989, various Lebanese Factions signed the Taif Agreement in an attempt to end the Civil War, but Michel Aoun opposed the agreement, since it did not provide a deadline for the withdrawal of Syrian troops. = Leaders involved = In East Beirut, Aoun's provisional government consisted of himself (prime minister), Colonel Issam Abu Jamra (Greek Orthodox), and Brigadier General Edgar Maalouf (Greek Catholic). President Gemayel's decree, signed 15 minutes before his term expired, also included three Muslim ministers (Sunni, Shiite, Druze), but all three rejected the posts and immediately resigned. Despite this, Aoun insisted he was the legal Prime Minister.https://apnews.com/679141a291628d3e10907a43d3f3c5cb In West Beirut, Hrawi's government consisted of a cabinet equally divided between Christians and Muslims, with Selim Hoss as Prime Minister. The Commander-in-chief of the LAF, General Emile Lahoud, had been appointed on the 28 November 1989. In March 1990, the cabinet selected General Elie Hayek as commander of the Mount Lebanon region. The Lebanese Forces (LF) - headed by Samir Geagea - were headquartered in La Quarantaine (directly bordering Achrafieh from the East), and were in control of East Beirut, the coastal Metn and Baabda. They held the entire districts (cazas) of Keserwan, Jbeil, Batroun, Koura, Bcharri, and parts of Zgharta.  Events  = War begins = On 8 or 14 March 1989, Michel Aoun declared a \\"War of Liberation\\" against the Syrian occupation, which at that point spanned two-thirds of Lebanese territory. The declaration was preceded a series of clashes between pro-Syrian militias and pro-Aoun forces who tried to close Muslim and Druze militias south of Beirut. Farid El- Khazen of The Washington Post praised the war, writing that it was \\"not a Palestinian-Syrian-Israeli war for Lebanon, but a war by Lebanese for their own liberation\\". On 14-15 March 1989, Aoun's forces shelled West Beirut, while Syrian forces shelled East Beirut. In these shellings, 40 people were killed and 165 were wounded. On the 20th, both sides shelled Kesrwan, the Beqaa, ‚ÄòAley, Metn, Shuf, and the Beirut airport, resulting in 6 deaths and in 21 people being injured. By 31 March, the 17 days of shelling in Beirut, Metn, Aley, and Kesrwan had resulted in 101 deaths and 474 people being wounded. = Aoun under siege = On 9-11 August, the Syrian Army dropped 20,000 bombs over east Beirut. On 13 August 1989, Forces loyal to Aoun claimed to have repelled a joint Syrian-PLO-Druze attack on Suq-al Gharb, But historian Matthew Preston states that \\"in reality it was no more than a forceful probe\\". In September 1989, Elias Hrawi blockaded Michel Aoun's area in Beirut, leaving the 500,000 inhabitants of that area faced with fuel and food shortages. = War in East Beirut = In January 1990, Aoun launched an offensive against the Lebanese Forces in East Beirut. In the months that followed, over 1000 people were killed. In March, Aoun declared a halt to the fighting and announced his willingness to accept the Taif Agreement with certain amendments. = LF hands over territory to Hrawi Government = On the 1st April 1990, Hrawi‚Äôs government mandated Fleet Admiral Elie Hayek (who had been appointed commander of the Mount Lebanon region by the cabinet on the 11 March)https://www.facebook.com/GeneralHayek/photos/pb.2210586005936595.-2207520000../2210596455935550/?type=3&theater; to take over LF barracks in the governorate. This was part of an agreement between Geagea and Hrawi whereby the army would militarily and politically take over 2/3 of the Christian canton (the remaining 1/3 being the Northern governorate and Achrafieh in East Beirut), but the militia‚Äôs 10,000 strong force would remain intact for the time being.https://archive.org/stream/ArabTimes1990KuwaitEnglish/Apr%2012%201990%2C%20Arab%20Times%2C%20%237842%2C%20Kuwait%20%28en%29_djvu.txt Aoun, however, had publicly stated that he would not accept the handoff or any alliance between the LF and the Hrawi government.

Michel Aoun, who had declared a \\"War of Liberation\\" against Syria earlier during the year, and had just escaped a mysterious assassination attempt the previous day. On 11 October, Elias Hrawi requested a Syrian military intervention to end Aoun's \\"rebellion\\". In the following night, pro-Syrian forces tightened the noose around the Christian enclave, and tanks and armoured vehicles were deployed in the Shiite suburbs and around Souk-el-Gharb, south of Baabda. For the first time since the 1982 air battle, the Syrian Air force jets were allowed to enter the Lebanese air space in order to strike General Aoun military forces.

Aoun's forces were headquartered around the Presidential Palace in Baabda, Beirut. The Aounist areas were quickly overrun. At 7:00 a.m, the Syrian Army attacked the Lebanese Army in eastern Beirut. An estimated 700 people were killed by the Syrian soldiers that day and 2000 had been injured. Estimates of the Lebanese Army losses during the battle, of whom a proportion were executed by the Syrians and including Prisoners of War as between 400 and 500 soldiers. It was also reported that at least 200 supporters of General Aoun, most of them military personnel, were arrested by the Syrian forces in east Beirut and its suburbs, these men simply disappeared. At least 15 civilians were executed by Syrian soldiers in Bsous after having been rounded up from their homes. One hospital \\"received 73 bodies of Lebanese army soldiers, each executed at close range with a bullet in the lower right side of the skull\\" and that 15 civilians were killed by the Syrians in the Bsus. The killing of National Liberal Party (NLP) leader Danny Chamoun, which occurred a couple of days later, was also connected to these incidents. While the main confrontation was clearly a military one, the attackers afterwards in many instances turned to plundering, and tens of Aounist army soldiers and civilians were summarily executed by Syrian Army soldiers or the militias, as they cemented their hold on the capital.  Aftermath  The attack on the Aoun government marked the end of the Lebanese Civil War. Syria would dominate the political life of the country for the following 15 years, under the auspices of the Taif Agreement. On 16 October 1990, militias in Beirut began dismantling the Green Line, and on 13 November they completed their withdrawal from Beirut, before the 19 November deadline provided by the Taif agreement.

A spokesman for the Botswana Electoral Commission described the situation as \\"very normal\\" and said that the election date would not be changed. The opposition Botswana Alliance Movement (BAM) and Botswana Congress Party (BCP) were critical, however, with the former's Lepetu Setshwaelo describing it as \\"the biggest scandal since our independence\\" and calling the government \\"totally incompetent\\". The BCP said that the state of emergency was unnecessary. Campaign The main opposition party, the Botswana National Front (BNF) split in mid-1998 after party leader Kenneth Koma was suspended by the party's central committee, and then had the suspension overturned by a court ruling. After Koma returned to the party leadership, he formed a caretaker committee to remove the members who had opposed him. The excluded members subsequently left to form the BCP, which included 11 of the BNF's 13 MPs and most of its local councillors.Botswana: The October 1999 General Election EISA As a result, BCP leader Michael Dingake replaced Koma as Leader of the Opposition. Following talks that began in late 1998, the BNF, the United Action Party and five other opposition parties agreed to form the BAM in January 1999. However, the BNF had left the alliance by the end of April 1999 after the other parties refused to allow the BNF to determine the Alliance's candidates in every constituency. The election campaign was low- key, and focussed on poverty, unemployment, wealth distribution and the country's AIDS epidemic. The BDP campaigned on a promise of prudent financial management, industrial diversification and efforts to combat the AIDS problem. The BNF criticised the government's economic policy, claiming it was too focussed on urban areas. The BCP claimed the government was too complacent, having been in power since the mid-1960s.Elections held in 1999 IPU Results Aftermath Following the elections, the National Assembly re- elected Mogae as President on 20 October.

Svetozar Miletiƒá was one of the most influential ideological and political leaders of the Serbs living in the Habsburg lands.  Family  Miletiƒá's ancestor was Mileta Zavi≈°iƒá who came to Baƒçka from Kostajnica near the border of Bosnia where he led a company of three hundred men and fought against Ottomans for thirty two years. Since Ottomans wanted to punish him after they signed a peace treaty with Austrians, Mileta moved to Baƒçka and changed his last name to Miletiƒá. Mileta's son Sima, who was educated as merchant in Novi Sad, had fifteen sons and three daughters. Avram Miletiƒá, the oldest Sima's son and grandfather of Svetozar Miletiƒá, was merchant and songwriter who is best known for writing the earliest collection of urban lyric poetry on Serbian language. The second son of Avram Miletiƒá, also Sima like his grandfather, was a boot-maker and a father of Svetozar Miletiƒá. Svetozar Miletiƒá was the oldest of seven children born to Sima and Teodosija (n√©e Rajiƒá) Miletiƒá in the village of Mo≈°orin in ≈†ajka≈°ka, the Serbian Military Frontier, on 22 February 1826. His son-in-law Ja≈°a Tomiƒá, who was a publicist and leader of the Serbian radicals in Vojvodina, took up Miletiƒá's mantle at the turn of the century. Education Miletiƒá attended Gymnasia in Novi Sad, Modra, and Po≈æun (Bratislava), and defended a juristical doctorate in Vienna in 1854, but found his real vocation in politics, and at once constituted himself champion of the most advanced opinions. He wrote a song Veƒá se srbska zastava vije svuda javno (Already the Serb flag is unfurled everywhere), which was sung as the anthem of Vojvodina. He was a political fighter for the freedom and rights of Serbs and other peoples in Austria- Hungary. Miletiƒá was a founder of Ujedinjena omladina srpska (United Serb Youth), and founder and leader of the Srpska narodna slobodoumna stranka (Serb National Freethinkers Party). Also, he was founder and editor of the magazine Zastava (Flag; started in 1866). He took upon himself the heavy task of reconciling the traditional hostility between Serb and Magyar. Miletiƒá had come to the conclusion that the Serbian movement in the Vojvodina could be brought into line with the general Serbian aims of liberty and unity, and also with the wider European movement associated with such names as Niccolo Tommaseo, Daniele Manin, Mazzini, Garibaldi, L√©on Gambetta and Castelar. To this idea, he devoted all his intellectual gifts and highly combative energies. Other Serbs also became politically engaged, sympathizing with the ideas of the United Serb Youth, a movement which attracted a number of influential figures in Serbian public life in the period of the 1860s and 1870s. (These include Svetozar Markoviƒá, Milovan Jankoviƒá, Jevrem Grujiƒá, Jovan Iliƒá, ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá, Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Stojan Novakoviƒá, Vaso Pelagiƒá, Jovan Grƒçiƒá Milenko, Ja≈°a Tomiƒá Jakov Ignjatoviƒá, Vladimir Jovanoviƒá, Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin, Draga Dejanoviƒá and others). Also, as a member of the Srpska ƒåitaonica (the Serbian Reading Room), Miletiƒá along with a group of close associates (Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, Stevan Branovaƒçki and nine actors) founded the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad in 1861. In the year 1844, while at the Evangelical Lycee in Pozun (Bratislava), he made the acquaintance of the Slovak leader, ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, and fell under his influence. Miletiƒá begins to regard the Serbian people as a nation and refused Jan Kollar's concept, of only four Slavic tribes‚ÄîRussian, Polish, Czech and Southern Slav‚Äîand cited Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá's latest reforms based on the dialect from Eastern Herzegovina and phonetic spelling as well as Serb sovereignty before and after the Turkish invasions. On the occasion of the first great conflict in Europe Miletiƒá saw that his people must liberate themselves from the foreign yoke if they are to survive as a nation. Revolutions of 1848 In 1848‚Äì1849, when revolutions and rebellions were in the air, the Hungarians began their war against Austria, the Serbs, in turn, rose against the Hungarians for their national and civil liberties, but on the conclusion of peace they were incorporated as part of the Habsburg without any of their rights recognized, just like the rest of the nationalities. Pre- eminent among the Serbs at the time was Svetozar Miletiƒá, who during his student days in Pozun (Pressburg/Bratislava) edited a small newspaper entitled Serbski Soko, and then at Pest, in 1847, an almanac called Slavjanka, containing a collection of verses by upcoming Serbian poets. In 1848 Miletiƒá was preparing a prose edition of Slavjanka, which was to include essays on the French Revolution and on Ko≈õciuszko. He visited Belgrade and made friends with the foremost Liberals of Serbia. On this occasion he prepared a mission statement for a newly created student movement called simply United Youth (Ujedinjena Omladina), which was to have branches at Belgrade, Pest, Bratislava and Temesv√°r. He was deeply disappointed with the outcome of the Revolution of 1848, which he considered a failed opportunity for attaining national liberation. May Assembly The proclamation in which Miletiƒá invited all students to prepare the nation for its liberation, fell into the hands of Metternich's police, and from 1847 Miletiƒá was under their constant observation. In April 1848, the Hofkriegsrat in Vienna decided that this youth of twenty must be rendered innocuous. For Miletiƒá, when he saw the servility of the Serb delegation to the Diet at Bratislava, urged the younger generation to go among the people and rouse it to a struggle for national guarantees. He left Bratislava, went to Novi Sad, and then to the Military Frontiers, where he incited the ≈†ajka≈°i not to go to Italy and fight against Young Italy, and not go aboard ships which were to carry them like cattle to the slaughter- house, but he pleaded with them to await the National Assembly which was to convene on the 1 to 3 May 1848 (better known as the May Assembly). This assembly was formed by the young men round Miletiƒá, but its directive was controlled by stronger forces than they‚ÄîPatriarch Josif Rajaƒçiƒá, Vojvoda Stevan ≈†upljikac, the Austrophil Serbian Government in Belgrade, and Austrian General Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá. This and the chauvinism of the Magyars gave to the Serbian movement in 1848, and still more in 1849, a tendency which Miletiƒá could not agree with. He would always take time to point out that Serbs and the Slavs would not shake off their yoke through these struggles. His private inclination was to take advantage of all the disorder in Europe and go our own way‚Äîto complete national liberation. Miletiƒá would have much preferred to find a modus vivendi with the Magyars, and that the Frontiersmen (Grenzer) should have been sent, in conjunction with Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, Prince of Serbia and Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° of Montenegro, to liberate Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Old Serbia instead. But he was alone in these aspirations (except for Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° who espoused the same ideas as Miletiƒá), unfortunately, isolated and powerless, and torn between the desire to help the Serbian cause such as it was and the awareness that it was not what it ought to be. When this proved impossible, Miletiƒá took an increasingly lukewarm attitude in the movement from then on, and on 6 April 1849, when the breath of reaction could already be felt, he withdrew himself altogether. Disgusted at the turn of events and the direction the national life was taking, Miletiƒá dropped politics altogether and began to think about his interrupted schooling. He studied law in Vienna, and was granted one of the bursaries founded by Prince Mihailo (Obrenoviƒá), but he reserved to himself full liberty of political opinions and action, and for the Prince's foundation he rendered thanks to the nation! A long period was to elapse before he could repay by his national work the debt which he owed to Rajaƒçiƒá (who sponsored him) and Prince Mihailo, for the reactionary Bach rƒógime made all public life impossible. Miletiƒá speedily and successfully completed his bar examination and set up practice at Novi Sad, and about that time married. Miletiƒá soon became famous and acquired an independent material position. It was as though he delighted in the sense of his growing powers, and yet declined to undertake any public work, so long as such conditions prevailed as permitted him from putting forth his full effort. Political career A 1867 lithograph of Miletiƒá by Josef Kriehuber These conditions changed after the Austrian defeats at Solferino and Magenta, when Franz Joseph, by the October Diploma of 1860, found it necessary to promise the introduction of constitutional government. As one means of appeasing the Magyars, Franz Joseph ordered the speedy reincorporation of the Serbian Vojvodina in the Kingdom of Hungary. But they were not satisfied with this concession and insisted upon the constitution of 1848, which was only granted after Austria's fresh defeat at K√∂niggr√§tz in 1866. In the six years during which this trial of strength between Austria and Hungary lasted the attitude of the Serbs and Croats, Romanians and Slovaks assumed very considerable importance. Indeed, if the nationalities had sided with Austria during this period, as they had done in 1848, Hungary would hardly have attained that complete independence from the Austrian monarchy which was embodied in the Compromise, or Ausgleich of 1867. But the absolutist r√©gime of Alexander von Bach had alienated the nationalities, and they flung themselves into the arms of Magyar Liberalism. The Magyars for their part at this time laid greater streets on the Liberal than upon the Magyar side of things. And no one did more for this new policy than Svetozar Miletiƒá, as representative of the Hungarian Serbs. He took the role of mediator graciously and the burden of reconciling the traditional animosities between two stubborn nationalities, and dissipating the doubts and suspicions which ten years of reaction had kindled. Miletiƒá had reached the conviction that the Serbian movement in the Vojvodina could be brought into line with the general Serbian aims of liberty and unity, and also with the wider European movement. To this idea, he devoted all his intellectual gifts and highly combative temperament. For a certain time, circumstances favored him. Mihailo Obrenoviƒá III, Prince of Serbia was in touch with Andrassy and Ferenc Deak, who were at the time willing to help Serbia acquire Bosnia and Herzegovina and liberate her kinsmen under the Turkish yoke; and for this Miletiƒá was ready and eager to render them any possible service in return. The Vojvodina was reincorporated towards the end of 1860, and on 4 January 1861, Miletiƒá published an article which was long to serve as his party's policy, and in which, while not taking exception to Hungary's acceptance of the Vojvodina at the hands of Austria, he announced to the latter that she need no longer reckon upon the Serbs in her quarrels with other nations. In the same year, at a political meeting of Hungarian Serbs, held at Sremski Karlovci in Syrmia, he put forward the idea of seeking guarantees for their nationality, by friendly agreement with the Magyars. In the year 1865, he was elected to the Croatian Sabor and supported a peculiar kind of Dualism under which both Austria and Hungary would be reorganized on a federal basis: he, therefore, joined the party club which passed as Magyarophil. Among the older Serbian intellectuals this policy awakened but little response. But for the very reason the younger generation‚Äîthe intelligentsia, merchants, and artisans alike‚Äîgathered all the more eagerly around \\"the eagle of Novi Sad,\\" wherein 1866 they organized the \\"United Youth\\" (Ujedinjena Omladina) as the symbol of political unity. The foremost Serbian poets and writers of that time gave their support to the Omladina movement, which found alike its Achilles Miletiƒá and its Ajax in Laza Kostiƒá, Odysseus in ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, and Homer in Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj. This new bourgeoisie was in close contact with the peasantry, and little by little, between 1861 and 1871, the whole Serbian nation in the Vojvodina gave its adherence to the national party of Miletiƒá. When in 1872 elections were held for the autonomous Church Assembly, this party obtained 72 out of a total of 75 seats. Throughout this period all the honors which it was in the power of the Serbs to confer were lavished upon Svetozar Miletiƒá as their recognized leader. From 1865 to 1884 he represented them in the Parliament at Budapest; in 1861 and 1867 he was Mayor of Novi Sad; in 1871 he became President of the Matica Srpska, the oldest Serbian cultural institution. And the Omladina in its dreams accorded him the honor of Voivode in the Banat and Baƒçka and Supreme Zupan in the three counties which Deak, in 1862, had promised to delimit on a national basis. The Compromise Naturally when the Magyars concluded their 1867 Compromise with Austria and the foreign policy of the new Dual Monarchy fell into the hands of Count Andrassy, whom Austria had hanged in effigy in 1849; when Prince Mihailo of Serbia was assassinated in 1868 and Andrassy adopted as part of his programme the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and when the New Hungary began to falsify their former Liberal principles in the interest of wholesale Magyarisation, then no one reacted more strongly to the changed situation than he who had up till this time been the firmest believer in Magyar liberalism. Politically, the principle underlying the agreement was that the empire should be divided into two portions, in one of these the Magyars were to rule, in the other the Germans; in either section the Slav races (the Serbs and Croatians, the Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Ruthenians, and Slovenes) and the Romanians and Italians were to be placed in a position of political inferiority, according to Henry de Worms's The Austro- Hungarian Empire (London, 1876). Thus Miletiƒá became the champion against whose breast was pointed all the lances of authority in Hungary and in Austria. With their policy of \\"whip and hay,\\" of repression and secret funds, Andrassy, Lonyay and Kalman Tisza tried to split up the party of Miletiƒá after Prince Mihailo's murder. Andrassy even accused Miletiƒá of complicity in the crime and suspended him from his post as Mayor of Novi Sad. This maneuver failed, and the ranks of the National Party closed firmly than ever around their leader. In the same way in 1870 Andrassy secured Miletiƒá's sentence of a year's imprisonment owing to his attacks upon the corrupt anti-national regime of Baron Levin Rauch in Croatia. Both on entering and leaving prison Miletic had a triumphal reception from his compatriots in the Vojvodina, and henceforth he was the uncontested master of their souls. But even in this situation, he was at all times ready to come to terms with the Magyars. His conditions of peace were summed up in a single phrase: \\"The Balkans for the Balkan people.\\" Roman Catholic Austria, he argued, could not satisfy her own Catholic Slavs‚Äîthe Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, and Croats‚Äîlet alone hope to fulfill a mission in the Balkans. Serbian-American inventor Mihajlo Pupin in his highly acclaimed, Pulitzer prize-winning autobiography From Immigrant to Inventor, wrote on page 21: Svetozar Miletich, the great nationalistic leader of the Serbs in Austria-Hungary, visited Panchevo, and the people prepared a torchlight procession for him. This procession was to be a protest of Panchevo and the whole of Banat against the emperor's treachery of 1869. My father had protested long before by excluding the emperor's picture from our house. That visit of Miletich marks the beginning of a new political era in Banat, the era of nationalism. The schoolboys of Panchevo turned out in great numbers, and I was one of them, proud to become one of the torch-bearers. Incarceration Funeral of Miletiƒá Consequently, Miletiƒá fostered such opposition to Austria's progress in the Balkans, that the occupation of Bosnia logically involved the political extinction of Miletiƒá. In accordance with the wishes of Franz Joseph I of Austria and Count Andrassy, K√°lm√°n Tisza, with his accustomed brutality, and an entire disregard of parliamentary immunity, ordered the arrest of Miletiƒá on 5 July 1876, and then began his search for incriminating evidence. In the prisons of Vojvodina he found a single witness, a decayed individual whose word no court free from political influence would have dreamt of accepting. Not knowing how long the Eastern Crisis ushered in by Serbo-Turkish War would last, Tisza postponed the trial for eighteen months. Setting his hopes on European opinion, Mihailo Polit-Desanƒçiƒá, Miletiƒá's comrade-in-arms, did all he could to hasten an investigation (which would ultimately prove Miletiƒá's innocence) by brilliantly defending him in court in Budapest, but to no avail. At the beginning of 1878, Miletiƒá was condemned for high treason and sentenced to five years' ordinary imprisonment and a heavy fine. On 27 November 1879, when the occupation of Bosnia was already an accomplished fact, Franz Joseph pardoned the victim of his policy of Balkan expansion. Though Miletiƒá's health was broken by his three and a half years of confinement, he still found the strength to lead his compatriots in the Vojvodina for another two years. In 1881, in face of acute pressure on the part of the administrative authorities, he secured his election to the Parliament of Budapest, and in a speech of the following year summoned the Monarchy to evacuate Bosnia and Herzegovina. The words of Hamlet, which perhaps were more often on his lips than those of any character in literature, became an obsession with him. Hic et Ubique‚Äîat every turn, on floor and roof!‚Äîhe saw K√°lm√°n Tisza lurking about, pulling down the wall of his room upon him or laying weights upon his head and making it impossible for him to sleep. From 1884 to 1889, his illness was so severe that he had to be removed to an asylum. Then, at last, his madness left him, but, unhappy, though he lived till the year 1901, his mind never fully recovered sufficiently enough for him to resume his leadership of the Serbs of Vojvodina, now badly disunited and weakened. His disappearance from public life contributed very materially to the long period of depression through which the Serbs went, and which lasted right on till the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. And even today the Serbs of Vojvodina are all too conscious of the vacuum that Miletiƒá left. He possessed to a surprising degree the arts of the orator, combined with a magnificent and striking physical presence which today is embodied in his monument in Novi Sad where he was the Lord Mayor. Miletiƒá died at Vr≈°ac on 4 February 1901, and was buried in Novi Sad.

Biography Born in 1927 in Austin, Texas, Bartzen won three Texas state high school titles -- two in singles and one in doubles -- and the National Interscholastic singles championship. Bartzen attended the College of William & Mary, where the left-hander posted a 50‚Äì0 singles record. He also won the NCAA doubles title with Fred Kovaleski in 1948. Bartzen went on the American tennis circuit and was ranked in the top 10 nine straight years (1953‚Äì1961), two of them at No. 2 (1959 and 1960). Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph ranked him World No. 8 for 1959. During his career, he had wins over such future Hall of Famers as Vic Seixas and Tony Trabert. One of those wins over Trabert came in 1955 in the final at the event in Cincinnati, where Bartzen won three titles: 1955, 1957 and 1958. Bartzen reached the semifinals of the U.S. National Championships in 1959 (beating Vic Seixas before losing to Neale Fraser) and the quarterfinals in 1955. He also won four U.S. Clay Court Championships and won the Canadian National title in 1954. He served as co-captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team and won 15 singles matches. After his playing career, Bartzen served 12 years as head tennis pro at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted the Colonial National Invitational Tournament, before taking over the Texas Christian University program in 1974. His tennis teams were ranked nationally every year but one in a 20-year stretch. Bartzen was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

With each change, the subject matter has always remained the same: political matter, knowledge, and spirituality.  History  The idea for the band Corporate Avenger was born some time between 1995 and 1996 when brothers, Spike and Brad Xavier were on tour in the band Humble Gods. Years later, Spike met with Marco of 1605 Studio in Huntington Beach, California and recorded some songs. In 1999 these songs were released on Suburban Noize records as the 'Taxes are Stealing' EP. This EP featured the first song ever recorded by the group, 'Evolve', a song questioning the origins of the native peoples of the Americas. At the time of the 'Taxes are Stealing' EP, the band consisted of eight members, including Pakelika of The Kottonmouth Kings, nameless members of 20 Dead Flower Children & No Doubt. During this phase of the band's history, the group had an ever- changing line up and no two shows would be alike. Some times the band would show up to a location unannounced, play a few songs, and then leave. In 2000 the group released another CD titled 'The New Testament'. This CD featured new songs as well as three songs from the previous EP. It also featured a new line up including the first appearance of vocalist Adawee the Wind. The sound on 'The New Testament', while still electronic in nature, is much more aggressive and not only pushes the band's views further but also pushes the envelope with songs such as 'The Bible is Bullshit', 'Jesus Christ Homosexual', and 'Enemy of the Gospel'. The CD was seen as a way to bridge the gap between the previous EP and the full length album they were working on at the time. In July 2001, the band released its first full length album, Freedom Is a State of Mind, released on Suburban Noize Records via Koch Entertainment. The album had songs from both previous EP releases, including a few remixes of some of the oldest songs, and several new songs that again evolved the band's sound and message. Songs like 'Christians Murdered Indians', 'FBI File', and 'Voting Doesn't Work' had a hard, aggressive rap sound with Adawee providing sung vocals (a stark change of pace from Spike's angry spoken word vocals). 2005 saw the release of the 'Born Again' CD, and more personnel changes. Spike and Adawee were still the core of the band, but this time around the music had taken on a more metal sound with songs like 'Jihad Schmihad' and 'Gay Muslims for Christ'. This album was not put out through Suburban Noize Records but rather through Massive Sound Records and sold via Merch.com, a first for the group. 'Born Again' also saw the departure of The Taxman, who claimed to leave the band to work on a solo record.

The village has a Serb ethnic majority and its population numbering 2,569 people (as of 2011 census). History The village was first time mentioned in the 16th century. During the Ottoman rule (16th-17th century), it was populated by ethnic Serbs. Since 1699, it was under Habsburg rule and was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier (≈†ajka≈° Battalion). In 1848-1849, Mo≈°orin was part of the Serbian Vojvodina, a Serb autonomous region within Austrian Empire, but since 1849, it is again part of the Military Frontier, until 1873 when it was included into Baƒçka-Bodrog county. Since 1918, Mo≈°orin is part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia). Between 1918 and 1922 it was part of Baƒçka county, between 1922 and 1929 part of Belgrade oblast, and between 1929 and 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. In 1941, the village was occupied by Axis troops and attached to Horthy's Hungary. In the 1942 raid, performed on Orthodox Christmas, the Hungarian troops killed 205 villagers, including 94 men, 41 women, 44 children and 26 old persons, of whom 170 were Serbs, 34 Romani, and 1 Hungarian. Part of the corpses of the killed villagers was thrown into the iced waters of the river Tisa, while other part was buried into four mass graves. Axis occupation ended in 1944. Since then Mo≈°orin was part of the new Socialist Yugoslavia.

It is manufactured by Sorbothane, Inc., based in Kent, Ohio. History Sorbothane was invented and patented in 1982 by Dr. Maurice Hiles,https://news.google.com/patents?id=qoQzAAAAEBAJ&zoom;=4&pg;=PA1#v=onepage&q;=&f;=false a British inventor. It was prepared by mixing polyol and isocyanate. His research into the energy dissipation properties of human soft tissue disclosed a structure very similar to an interpenetrating polymer network. This led to his synthesis of the first commercial simultaneous interpenetrating network, now called Sorbothane.http://www.designnews.com/article/327542-Unique_Urethane_Dampens_Shocks_and_Noise.php Dr. Hiles wrote in his patent \\"The resulting solid polymer behaves like a quasi-liquid, being readily deformed by an applied force and slow to recover, although in the absence of such a force it takes up a defined shape and volume\\". In 1976, he contacted the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) about his invention; the NRDC spent almost ¬£10,000 in helping him to improve and patent the polymer. BTR Industries obtained the license from NRDC for selling them. Properties The material combines some of the properties of rubber, silicone, and other elastic polymers. It is considered to be a good vibration damping material, an acoustic insulator, and highly durable. An unusually high amount of the energy from an object dropped onto Sorbothane is absorbed. The feel and damping qualities of Sorbothane have been likened to those of meat. Sorbothane is a visco-elastic material, meaning that it exhibits properties of both liquids (viscous solutions) and solids (elastic materials), with a relaxation time of two seconds. Because visco-elastic behavior is desirable in shock and vibration applications, many materials claim to be viscoelastic; however, many of these materials have only trace viscoelastic properties. Similar materials include polynorbornene, Noene, and Astro-sorb. Uses Sorbothane has many industrial applications, from acoustic shielding to machine mounts. It has been used to quiet personal computers by being packed around the hard drive and other noisy spinning components. Sorbothane dampens vibration transmission from vibrating hardware. In addition, Sorbothane has been used by NASA to isolate vibration, in the Air Force Memorial, and to transport the Liberty Bell. It is currently used with insoles and heel pads to absorb impacts during sports activities such as football, cricket, and rugby. Because of its ability to dramatically diminish shock waves and maintain its shape under stress,http://www.sorbothane.com/material-properties.php Sorbothane has shown promise in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, and medial epicondylitis, or golfer's elbow.http://www.tendoneaseusa.com/p-faq.html It is also used in recoil pads of guns.

The highway is the singular roadway connecting the mainland and beaches to Watson Island and the bay neighborhoods of Palm Island, Hibiscus Island, and Star Island. The MacArthur Causeway carries State Road 836 and State Road A1A over the Biscayne Bay via a girder bridge. Interstate 395 ends at Fountain Street, the entrance to Palm Island Park which has a traffic light as well as bus stops. History In the late 1910s, with the deteriorating wooden Collins Bridge (now, the Venetian Causeway) as the only direct land route between mainland Miami and the barrier islands of Miami Beach, construction on the roadway began in 1917. The roadway, dedicated as the County Causeway, was completed in 1920. Watson Island was reclaimed surrounding the western end of the roadway, completed in 1926. Having undergone several lane and structural expansions following opening of the original two-lane road, the State Road Board and Dade County Commission voted to rename the causeway in honor of World War II General Douglas MacArthur in 1942. The causeway was accessible from mainland Miami via Biscayne Boulevard and intersecting side streets through the 1990s, when replacement of the western- and easternmost spans and construction of direct highway access to I-395 began. The eastbound lanes of the bridges were completed in 1995, and westbound lanes finished in 1997. Gallery File:MacArthur Causeway 20100520.jpgLarge portion of the causeway.

From about 1912 through 1982 the state ran a state asylum on these grounds. That institution would grow to hold 3,000 patients. Mid-State opened as a correctional institution, in the extensive former hospital buildings, in 1983. Mid-State has grown and now includes maximum security SHU-200, opened in 1998. These blocks are called \\"S\\" blocks, and consist of prisoners living in cells with bunk beds. These prisoners are let out into their porches for several hours, numerous times throughout every day. The place where they are allowed to go outside mimics their room except that it is outside, and surrounded by a fence. Even though Mid-State has a maximum security building it is still classified as a medium security prison. Mid-State cleared the way for its neighbor, Marcy Correctional Facility located across the street, and two others the Oneida Correctional Facility and Mohawk Correctional Facility. Phase One During the first phase of the prison, Mid-State shared its place with a hospital that took care of the criminally insane.New York State Department of Correctional Services The hospital was known as the Central New York Psychiatric Center.  Phase Two  The second phase took place in 1986. This increased the size of the site that the hospital and Mid-State had to share. Eventually the whole site was left to Mid-State and the Central New York Psychiatric Center. Since 1983 there have not been any escapes or other troublesome incidents. There are of coiled razor sharp wire to prevent prisoners from escaping.  Mid-State today  Mid-State has provided many jobs to people in New York. Mid-State consists of over of land, with buildings dating back to the 1920s. Among the older buildings, there are many new and improved facilities as well. The structures of the new buildings maintain the same look as the original, consisting of red brick. There are two new buildings, the medical building and the \\"S\\" block, which is the only maximum security part of the prison. There is also a large recreation yard that has a racquetball court, basketball court, football field, and also a gym, which the prisoners use the most. In addition to the outdoor area there are many other things to keep up around the prison, and it is the inmates' responsibility to take care of and maintain them all. For the good prisoners and the ones who are only in for a short time, they are taken out on a prison bus around Oneida County. They help clean up the city and surrounding areas by picking up garbage along the sides of the roads, mowing church lawns, and helping with other outdoor maintenance.

T. Anderson. It is set in modern Clayton, Massachusetts. The main character, Christopher, just wants a normal life; to date his crush Rebecca Schwartz, stay up late, and other teenager things. Unfortunately, Chris has much more to worry about than puberty ‚Äî he also has to deal with his vampirism. Plot summary The story is set in the town of, and in the areas surrounding, Bradley, Massachusetts. A vampire lord, Tch'muchgar, is magically imprisoned in isolation at the bottom of the town reservoir. The townsfolk performs rituals at the annual The Sad Festival of Vampires to maintain the bonds holding Tch'muchgar prisoner. Early in the book the young \\"hero\\", Chris, witnesses a vampiress being lynched. Soon after, he starts to feel a strange sensation ‚Äî a growing thirst for blood. Chris later notices that his friend Tom is casting a reflection on the water of the reservoir but Chris himself has no reflection. He realizes that he must be suffering from vampirism. Chris is afraid to tell anyone, even his friends, because vampires are killed immediately upon being discovered. Chris is soon confronted by a mysterious person dressed in black, who introduces himself as Chet the Celestial Being. Chet says that he serves the Forces of Light, and that he can cure Chris of his vampirism. But first Chet must place a holy object, The Arm of Moriator, with Tch'muchgar. Once activated, the Arm cannot be moved or deactivated by evil beings. Chet explains that if Tch'muchgar tries to escape from his prison, the Arm will cause him to become trapped between worlds, just like \\"opening an elevator between floors\\". Chet leaves for two weeks to retrieve the Arm. Meanwhile, Chris's vampirism grows at a steady rate. He starts sleeping during the day and staying awake at night. He drinks warm water to simulate drinking blood, and even considers his family as potential \\"beverages\\". Chris also begins receiving letters through mail from vampires living underground in the community. One of these letters is from a female vampire named Lolli, who appears to be Chris's age and behaves like a popular adolescent girl. Chris starts to notice he is being stalked by a creepy humanoid figure he describes as \\"The Thing with the One-Piece Hair\\", or simply The Thing. The Thing corners Chris in the woods, but Chet appears and \\"kills\\" The Thing. He warns Chris that The Thing is not really dead and will rematerialize within a few minutes. So Chet places a mark on Chris' wrist, which he said will protect him from the Thing. Chet gives Chris the Arm and bring him to a congregation of vampires in an abandoned church. Chris is accepted as a vampire by the others and learns that they plan to summon Tch'muchgar. He takes this opportunity to enter the realm of Tch'muchgar and drops the Arm. Chris returns to his \\"normal\\" life and waits for Chet to return with further instruction. His vampiric symptoms continue to grow. Crazed with thirst, Chris almost bites his friend's dog. He resorts to going hunting for raccoons to drink from. After he cuts himself shaving for the first time, Chris begins drinking his own blood. He eventually resorts to biting himself in the arm. One evening, his mother tells him a story about how Chris nearly died as a newborn, but that a strange nurse took him away for a few minutes. When she brought him back, he was fine. His mother believes that the woman was an angel. Chris fears that the nurse must have been a vampire who infected him with vampirism to save his life. At the Sad Festival of Vampires, Chris is talked into going to a party with Lolli and another young vampire called Bat. They tell him that to become initiated into the vampire community he must make his first kill that night and smear his blood on his cheeks. Chris shies away from the challenge, saying that he couldn't find anyone yet, but Lolli quickly calls his bluff. Chris escapes from the party and finds his crush, Rebecca Schwartz, in the area. He tells her that he needs to talk, but his teeth start to grow in bloodlust. Chris flees back to the vampire party, only to find that everyone save one high student has left. The student tells Chris that Lolli killed a student. Afterwards, she was hit by a car and broke her back. The authorities arrived and took her to be killed. Chris hears Bat coming, and runs outside. He meets Chet, who confirms the story about Lolli's death. Bat hears this and attacks Chet, but Chet makes Bat vanish with a wave of his hand, presumably killing him. At the climax of the story, Tch'muchgar attempts to leave his prison but is shoved out of the dimension and into nonexistence by the Arm of Moriator. Chet reveals that he was actually working for Tch'muchgar, who had realized that he would never escape his prison and was looking for a way to end his miserable life. He also taunts that he was lying about being able to help Chris, because vampirism is incurable. Chet gleefully points out to Chris that he is now doomed. If he kills mortals for blood, they will eventually hunt him down and execute him. If he refuses to drink blood, he will die. If he seeks help from the Forces of Light, they will torment him in place of the vampire lord. If he tries to get help from other vampires, they will kill him themselves for destroying their god. At the end of the story, in Chris's home, his mother is suspicious, and wants him to be tested for vampirism. His brother treats this with derision, but Chris wonders how his mother would react. He has a flashback to when he was young, that a mother bird would not take in her own child if it had been touched by a human; it would rather bash its skull in. The flashback ends with some older boys throwing stones at a hatchling, yelling \\"This is mercy!\\" with other children joining in. As the book ends, Chris's fate is uncertain, leaving the main plot of the book unresolved though Chris is certainly doomed either way. In the end, Chris realizes that he needs to feed, but he cannot feed. Reviews The novel garnered mostly upbeat reviews. The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books said \\"it...is smart, taking the old vampire story and really thinking about it rather than merely letting the vampire go through his traditional paces\\" while Publisher's Weekly commented \\"The overtly supernatural climax and a disappointing plot twist squelch the sparkle of Anderson's prose somewhat\\".

Sands, (born Edward Fitzgerald Snyder, April 4, 1894 - ?), also known as Edward Fitzwilliam Strathmore and Jazz, was a suspect in the murder of Hollywood director William Desmond Taylor on February 1, 1922. Biography Edward Sands had been employed as Taylor's personal assistant, serving as cook and valet. Although he was born in Ohio, he spoke with an affected English accent (screen star Mary Miles Minter referred to him as a cockney). Taylor left Sands in charge of his affairs during a vacation in 1921 and returned to find Sands gone and several of the director's possessions missing including his car, checkbook, a large supply of distinctive cigarettes and jewelry. Sands had cashed several blank checks left by Taylor and, using the stolen checkbook, began forging Taylor's signature. A few months later Taylor received a letter from Sands which included a pawn ticket in the name of William Deane Tanner (Taylor's birth name), indicating that Sands knew Taylor's true identity, which Taylor had kept secret since his arrival in Hollywood eight years earlier. Sands seems to have returned clandestinely. One of the distinctive stolen cigarettes was found (smoked and crushed) on Taylor's doorstep and footprints were left on Taylor's bed. Some more of Taylor's jewelry was stolen and receipts were found showing Sands had sold the items in northern California.Taylorology Disappearance An eyewitness reported seeing someone leaving Taylor's bungalow around the time he was murdered, but her description does not fully match Sands' appearance. The police considered Sands a strong suspect, but never issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the murder. Sands reportedly quit a job in northern California and disappeared the day of the murder. Subsequent investigations turned up evidence he had likely been arrested previously for petty crimes and had apparently deserted from the United States Coast Guard.Giroux, p. 116-7. Sands was never found.

Location The Orinoco Delta is one of the eight natural regions of Venezuela. It covers the whole of Delta Amacuro State and a few square kilometers of Monagas State and Sucre State, comprising all the mouths of the Orinoco. It is divided into two sections: the principal, at the northernmost part of the system, located between Ca√±o Manamo and the left shore of Ca√±o Araguao, where the majority of villages are established, including the state capital Tucupita; and the secondary, between the right shore of Ca√±o Araguao and R√≠o Grande. The Warao people live in the region. Hydrology The delta is fan-shaped, formed by the Orinoco River as it splits into numerous distributaries, called ca√±os, which meander through the delta on their way to the sea. The main distributary is called the Rio Grande, which empties south-southeast through the southern portion of the delta, and the second major distributary is Ca√±o Manamo, which runs northward along the western edge of the delta. The area of this region is approximately . The Orinoco Delta is characterized by being non-centric, lagoon lacking, and oceanic, somewhat similar to the delta of the Niger River. Daily tides bring sea water up the \\"ca√±os\\", causing the \\"macareo\\" or pororoca and reversing the flow direction of water, at least on surface. Environment The predominant vegetation is in the Orinoco Delta swamp forests ecoregion. Along the coast and the river margins there are stretches of Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves, specifically the Guianan mangroves ecoregion. To the west, and closer to the coast, there are patches of the Orinoco wetlands ecoregion. The delta includes large areas of permanent wetlands as well as seasonally-flooded freshwater swamp forests. The river margins of the delta are fringed with mangroves.

E. Smith, the second in his Skylark series. Originally serialized through the Amazing Stories magazine in 1930, it was first collected in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press. Plot synopsis Skylark Three (1948) is the second book in the Skylark series and is set a year after the events of The Skylark of Space, during which year antagonist Marc \\"Blackie\\" DuQuesne has used the wealth obtained in the previous book to buy a controlling interest in the story's 'World Steel Corporation', a large company known for its ruthless attitude. When the story begins DuQuesne announces a long absence from Earth, to find another species more knowledgeable than the Osnomians allied with protagonist Richard Seaton. Shortly thereafter, DuQuesne and a henchman disappear from Earth. DuQuesne, by now aware of the 'Object Compass' trained on him, travels far enough to break the connection, then turns toward the 'Green System' of which Osnome is a part. Seaton discovers this, but is distracted by attempts to master a \\"zone of force\\": essentially a spherical, immaterial shield, with whose present form Seaton is dissatisfied for its opacity and impenetrability even by the user. Seaton is then requested by his allies Dunark and Sitar, the crown prince and prince's consort of Osnome, to repel invasion by the natives of planet 'Urvan', Osnome's neighbor; whereupon Seaton and his millionaire sponsor, Martin Crane, accompanied by their wives and Crane's valet Shiro embark in the spaceship Skylark II to obtain the necessary minerals. Near the Green System, they are attacked by the hitherto-unseen natives of the planet 'Fenachrone', whose weaponry surpasses any known to Seaton or the Osnomians. Having used the 'zone of force' at first to conceal himself, and then to destroy the Fenachrone battleship, Seaton captures a leading crew-member, who reveals (upon interrogation) that the Fenachrone intend conquest of the entire Milky Way Galaxy, and eventually of the Universe, and that a message is already in progress toward the Fenachrone capital to summon aid. Discovering that Dunark and Sitar survived the destruction of their spaceship, the Skylark II tows the remnants of both vehicles to Osnome, where Seaton forces a peace treaty between Osnome and Urvan. Meanwhile, DuQuesne and his aide have also interrogated a Fenachrone and plan to capture an entire Fenachrone battleship for personal use. Hoping to master the \\"zone of force\\", Seaton, Crane, and their wives travel from planet to planet of the 'Green System', in search of those already skilled in its use. Initially they encounter the Dasorians, an amphibious species of humanoid, who direct them to the Norlaminians, who possess full control of both matter and energy. A much larger successor ship, the Skylark Three, is built and equipped on planet Norlamin, where Seaton at first explores the Fenachrone's world, then orders the Fenachrone to abandon their conquest. Upon their refusal, Seaton remotely destroys their reconnaissance spaceships, and then goes on to a full-fledged genocide, destroying their home planet and killing all the Fenachrone except an escaped colony ship led by one of their leading scientists. Equipped with a Fenachrone spaceship, DuQuesne also survives, but leads Seaton and the Fenachrone to presume his death. Increasing his technology still further by powering his new ship with uranium instead of copper, Seaton pursues and destroys the Fenachrone colony ship; but does not discover DuQuesne. Reception P. Schuyler Miller reviewed the novel favorably, saying in Smith's hands space operatics \\"took on new freedom and stature\\".\\"Book Reviews\\", Astounding Science Fiction, September 1949, p.152 Arthur C.

Though they were once connected, the middle section of highway was concurrent with three different U.S. highways, so the middle section was decommissioned for reasons of redundancy. The southern section of highway runs from Antlers to U.S. Highway 64 near Warner, covering through the southeastern part of the state. The northern SH-2 runs for through Craig County in northeastern Oklahoma. Route descriptions =Southern section= The end of US-266 and SH-2 near Warner The southern section of SH-2 begins at SH-3 in Antlers. It travels north- northwest from here, roughly parallelling the Kiamichi River, until reaching Clayton and US-271. North of Clayton, Highway 2 and US-271 overlap for 3 miles (5 km). Immediately after this, SH-2 meets SH-43's eastern terminus southeast of Sardis Lake. SH-2 then crosses over the lake and meets SH-1/SH-63, and the three form a six-mile (10 km) concurrency. This area is mountainous and has some tight hairpin curves. After the concurrency Highway 2 continues northward, meeting US-270 at Wilburton. SH-2 then passes Robbers Cave State Park and the eastern edge of the Sansbois Mountains before reaching SH-31 east of Quinton, and the two form a six-mile (10 km) concurrency until Kinta. Ten miles (16 km) north of here, Highway 2 meets SH-9. Three miles (4.9 km) later, the highway passes the eastern terminus of SH-71, south of the town of Porum, Oklahoma. later, SH-2 meets US-266, which it will overlap until its end. After having an interchange at I-40 milemarker 278, both SH-2 and US-266 end at US-64 near Warner. =Northern section= The northern SH-2 begins at US-60/US-69 in Vinita. It then heads due north, meeting SH-25 four miles (6.5 km) west of Bluejacket. Six miles north of here, it comes to a junction with US-59 and SH-10 in Welch, Oklahoma. All signage for SH-2 ends at US-59/SH-10 in Welch. However, the official definition of the highway contains an unsigned concurrency with US-59 to the point where it crosses the state line into Kansas. History The northern SH-2, between Vinita and the Kansas state line, was once part of US-73. Until the early 1980s a portion of SH-2 was one of the last unpaved state highways in the Oklahoma road network. The section between the communities of Kosoma, Oklahoma and Stanley, Oklahoma in the Kiamichi River Valley, remained gravel. Its builders during the 1930s and 1940s, in order to save the expense of building two bridges across the Kiamichi River, routed the highway mid-way up the flank of Bull Creek Mountain. The highway traversed the mountain at its midway point, with no shoulders or guard rails. During the 1980s a new route was opened in the floor of the valley, featuring modern bridges across Pine Creek and the Kiamichi River. The old route on Bull Creek Mountain was decommissioned and is no longer in use. The section of SH-2 between I-40 and SH-9 was pressed into service as a detour for eastbound I-40 traffic after the collapse of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26, 2002.

History Woodstock College was originally located along the Patapsco River in Woodstock, Maryland, west of Baltimore. It incorporated in 1867, and opened on September 22, 1869. In the 1960s, the college began considering affiliating with an urban university. The argument to move the school into a city and place it in affiliation with broader network of institutions of higher learning received decisive support from the newest ideas of theological education and priestly formation emerging from the Second Vatican Council and the Jesuits' own Thirty-First General Congregation. In consequence, the college closed its original campus and moved to New York City, New York in 1969 where it operated in cooperation with the Union Theological Seminary and the Jewish Theological Seminary. Controversies over the merits of the move into the city, specific controversies arising over the life style of the Jesuits in training in New York, and a general desire of the order to consolidate their theology schools nationally led to the school's closure in 1974. It was survived until 2013 by the Woodstock Theological Center, an independent, nonprofit Catholic research institute located at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. The theological library retains its independence through an affiliation with the library at Georgetown University, where it is still housed. Campus The original campus buildings in Woodstock, Maryland are now used as a Job Corps Center, while the campus grounds are part of Patapsco Valley State Park.

Ozerov is known for its learning as one if the intellectual Hasidic dynasties. Rabbi Epstein was a disciple of the Seer of Lublin, the Holy Jew of Prshiskhe, the Ohev Yisrael of Apt, Poland, and Rabbi Myer, the Or LaShamayim of Apt. When Rabbi Myer died in 1827, his chasidim asked the Rabbi of O≈ºar√≥w to be their new rebbe. Rabbi Yehudah Leib accepted this position reluctantly. His followers numbered in the thousands. He moved to Opole towards the end of his life and died in 1837. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Yechiel Chaim Epstein. Rabbi Yechiel Chaim was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Arye Yehuda Leib Epstein, author of the Hasidic work Birkas Tov, in 1887. Rabbi Arye Yehuda Leib had six children: # Grand Rabbi Avraham Shlomo Epstein of Ozharov (1864-1917) (who succeeded his father in 1913), # Rabbi Eliezer Shalom Epstein of Partzev, # Rabbi Yoseph Epstein of Josef√≥w, # Grand Rabbi Alter Moshe David Epstein of ƒÜmiel√≥w, # Rabbi Yaakov Epstein, Rebbetzin Chava Rabinowicz (wife of Grand Rabbi Yerachmiel Tzvi Rabinowitz of Biala- Shedlitz), and # Rebbetzin Feiga Taub (wife of Rabbi Yaakov Yerachmiel Taub of Radom, brother of Rabbi Israel Taub of Modzhitz).

Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917), is a New York state contract case in which the New York Court of Appeals held Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, to a contract that assigned the sole right to market her name to her advertising agent. Facts Lady Duff Gordon as she appeared in 1917 The plaintiff, Otis F. Wood, was a top New York advertising agent whose clients included major commercial clients as well as celebrities. The defendant, Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, otherwise known as \\"Lucile\\" (her couture label), was a leading designer of fashions for high society as well as the stage and early silent cinema, and was a survivor of the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic. Lady Duff-Gordon signed a contract with Wood giving him the exclusive right to market garments and other products bearing her endorsement for one year beginning on April 1, 1915. This contract gave Lucy Duff Gordon half of all revenues thus derived. Wood's only duties under the contract were to account for monies received and secure patents as necessary - but if Wood did not work to market the clothes, no monies would be received and no patents would become necessary. Around the same time, Duff-Gordon came up with an idea to market a line of clothing \\"for the masses\\" and broke the purported agreement by endorsing products sold by Sears Roebuck. Wood sued, with Lucy defending on the grounds that no valid contract existed. Lucy argued that since Wood had not made an express promise to do anything, the agreement was invalid and could not be enforced for lack of consideration. The trial court disagreed with her argument and found for Wood but was reversed by the Appellate Division, an intermediate appellate court. Wood then appealed to the Court of Appeals of New York, the highest court in the state, which then considered whether an agreement with a promise not expressly stated might still require performance of that promise given the context of the agreement. Judgment The Court, in an opinion by Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, made new law by determining that a promise to exclusively represent the interests of a party constituted sufficient consideration to require enforcement of an unstated duty to use reasonable efforts based on that promise. Cardozo wrote of the arrangement that \\"[a] promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be 'instinct with an obligation,' imperfectly expressed.\\" \\"The acceptance of the exclusive agency,\\" he found, \\"was an assumption of its duties.\\" He stated, \\"the law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman...it takes a broader view today.\\" Based on this reasoning, the Appellate Division was reversed, and the decision of the trial court was reinstated. The case, with a relatively short and concisely written opinion, has become a staple of American and Canadian law school contracts casebooks, along with several other opinions written by Judge Cardozo.

Other names for similar Muslim clerics include sheikh and mullah. The Standard Chinese word for imam (), used in particular by the Hui people, also derives from this term. Duty Akhoonds are responsible for leading religious services in a community. Akhoonds lead the prayers in the mosques, deliver religious sermons and perform religious ceremonies, such as birth rites and funeral services. They also often teach in Islamic schools known in Iran as hawzas and in other countries as madrasas. Akhoonds will usually have completed some studies (of varying levels) in a hawzeh, studying various Islamic and non-Islamic subjects such as Sharia, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Quran, and basic mathematics. They commonly dress in religious attire. Old usage This term was traditionally a slang term in Iran, and it has been completely a derogatory term since the Pahlavi era. In Iran, they are also called mullah, molavi, sheikh, haj-agha, or rohani. The word rohani means \\"spiritual, holy\\". Rohani is considered a more polite term for Muslim clerics, used by Iranian national television and radio and by devout Muslim families. Akhoond is increasingly outmoded in Iran, usually with only the older clerics having the title as part of their name. It has not been used widely as a title since the Qajar dynasty. In Afghanistan, and among the Pashtuns of the Afghan- Pakistan border region, the term is still current in its original sense as an honorific.  Use in personal names  The Azerbaijani surname Akhundov (as in e.g. Mirza Fatali Akhundov) is formed from the word akhund.

Either the winner of this trophy or the winner of the Norm Fieldgate Trophy will also win the Canadian Football League Most Outstanding Defensive Player award. In 1995, as part of the failed American expansion, the McCaffrey trophy was given to the most outstanding defensive player in the South Division. Prior to 1974 the CFL's Most Outstanding Lineman Award was awarded to both outstanding defensive players and outstanding linemen in the East Division. James P.

Born Mabel Janice Busby, in Oregon in 1903, Stanford moved to San Francisco in 1924. From 1940 to 1949, she was madam of a bordello at 1144 Pine Street on Nob Hill in a house designed by architect Stanford White. She adopted the name Stanford as one of many pseudonyms for Mabel Busby. According to her autobiography Lady of the House, she saw a newspaper headline about Stanford University's winning a football game and adopted the surname. Madam Stanford ran one of San Francisco's more notorious brothels. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote \\"the United Nations was founded at Sally Stanford's whorehouse\\" because of the number of delegates to the organization's 1945 San Francisco founding conference who were Stanford's customers;Smith, Tyler Stodard, Whore Stories: A Revealing History of the World's Oldest Profession, Adams Media, Avon, Massachusetts (2012). many actual, if informal, negotiating sessions took place in the brothel's living room.

She paraded into the San Francisco Hilton ballroom wearing a feathered boa flowing down over an ornate, floor-length gown. Seated at the main table were Senator Edward Kennedy, Mayor Joseph Alioto, attorney Melvin Belli and the newly elected California Jaycees president Drew Frohlich. She took the podium after greeting each dignitary with a hug and a buss on the cheek. Stanford then brought the house down by naming each one in turn as a past or present customer. Politics and civic affairs In 1950, Stanford reopened the old Walhalla restaurant in Sausalito, California as the Valhalla and took up residency in Sausalito. The opening night was filled with music, lights, and notables from San Francisco and a few Sausalito \\"celebrities\\" as well.

As one of the last commercially built steam locomotives in the United States, the locomotive was built with the primary purpose of hauling long, heavy, high speed express passenger trains for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway such as the George Washington and the Fast Flying Virginian. Retired from active service in the late 1950s, the 614 was preserved and placed on display at the B&O; Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. Between 1979 and 1980, restoration work on the locomotive to operating condition took place, and it was used for extensive mainline excursion service from the early 1980s until the late 1990s. Today the locomotive is on temporary display at the C&O; Railway Heritage Center in Clifton Forge, Virginia awaiting a potential return to steam. History And Revenue Career Most railroads called their 4-8-4s \\"Northerns\\", which is short for the railroad first using the 4-8-4 type, Northern Pacific Railroad. The workers of the C&O; could not see naming these locomotives \\"Northerns\\" as the railroad was based in the southeast. The famous Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, a major resort on the C&O; mainline, was the inspiration for the name \\"Greenbrier\\" applied to these 4-8-4s.C&O; 614 on display in Clifton Forge, VA. The C&O; had a total of 12 4-8-4s, with the first five numbered 600-604 built in 1935, with the designation J-3. In 1942, two more were ordered from Lima numbered 605-606. In 1948, the design changed slightly and the 610-614 were produced, with the J-3-A designation. No. 614 was originally retired in 1952, but three years later, it, as well as No. 610 were brought back into revenue service to pull heavy freight trains in favor of the upcoming freight traffic on most American railroads. While being brought back into service, however, No. 614 was renumbered to 611, since there was a power shortage on the C&O; as to alleviate any confusion with some leased 4-8-4s from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, one of which was also numbered 614. The original C&O; 611 remained out of service. After just one year of revenue freight service, No. 614 was retired again, and it was placed in storage with a group of other C&O; steam locomotives in the form of a ‚Äòscrap line‚Äô in front of the C&O; diesel shops in Russel, Kentucky, where it remained for almost two decades. Excursion service In 1976, No. 614, as well as 2-8-4 Kanawha No. 2705 and 2-6-6-2 No. 1309, were sent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and were cosmetically restored for static display. During 1979, Ross E. Rowland Jr traded Reading T1 No. 2101, which was previously damaged in a roundhouse fire, to the museum in exchange for the 614. She was restored over the next 18 months with a cost of $1.5 million. During the restoration, 614 was given an auxiliary tender, doubling her water capacity to 50,000 gallons. This allowed the 614 to run for longer times without having to refuel as much. The Chessie Safety Express was 614's first major run, bringing her a bit of spotlight in the process. After the successful system tour, 614 was kept in Hagerstown, Maryland until 1985. American Coal Enterprise was developing a modern steam locomotive to be used as an alternative to rising oil costs by burning coal, known as the ACE 3000 Project. The 614 was modified for better performance under the guidance of David Wardale, and fitted with testing equipment to measure the performance of the engine. For several weeks in January and February 1985, 614 (now 614-T, symbolizing it as testing) hauled coal trains between Huntington and Hinton, West Virginia. The 614's fuel consumption costs were actually lower than most diesel locomotives operating at that time. C&O; 614 engine cab. In 1992, Rowland's vision of the 21st Century Limited was taking shape. To give the public an idea of the train, one side of 614 was decorated in a futuristic way with a blue streamlined shrouding and centered headlight. The 614 also came back to its former home at the B&O; Railroad Museum for temporary display. In 1995, 614 was moved to the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad in New Hope, Pennsylvania for a complete overhaul. It was then used for a series of popular excursions between Hoboken, New Jersey and Port Jervis, New York in conjunction with New Jersey Transit (NJT) between 1996 and 1998. Current status 614 was required to pull 26 cars at 79 mph on some sections, and maintain speed up several hills. During this time, 614 was equipped with cab signals, 26L brakes, speed control and an MU stand. The 614 was moved to storage on the Reading and Northern Railroad in Port Clinton, Pennsylvania. In 2000. Rowland put 614 up for auction at the NJT maintenance facility, but no buyers were interested. The locomotive is still maintained by Iron Horse Enterprises, the most recent servicing of the locomotive being in 2006. In 2010, discussions began between Rowland and Jim Justice, owner of the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia. The resort owner had been interested in running steam-powered excursion trains from Greenbrier to Washington DC. To be known as the \\"Greenbrier Express\\", Justice planned to use steam and diesel power in the project, but would have needed cooperation from CSX Transportation, the Buckingham Branch Railroad and Amtrak. In January 2011, 614 was moved to the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia for its Thoroughbreds of Steam exhibit. In May 2011, 614 was again moved to the C&O; Railway Heritage Center in Clifton Forge, Virginia. From there it went to Clifton Forge, Virginia where it was repainted in preparation for display for the Greenbrier Presidential Express. Unfortunately, the Greenbrier Express project was cancelled in May 2012 due to lack of funding and capacity problems on the CSX portion of the route, where a lack of passing sidings makes it difficult for Eastbound trains to gain headway against the flow of Westbound empty coal trains. The diesels and passenger cars were auctioned off, and 614 continues to sit on display at Clifton Forge. As of 2019, 614 is still painted in the failed Greenbrier Presidential Express scheme. Iron Horse Enterprises plans to invest the necessary funds to overhaul 614 for operation once an opportunity to run the engine is finalized.

It was reorganized in 1880 and 1902. The Ottoman rule in the region lasted until the First Balkan War (1912). The Sanjak of Novi Pazar included territories of present-day northeastern Montenegro and southwestern Serbia, also including some northern parts of Kosovo. The region is known as Ra≈°ka, and also called Sand≈æak. History =Background: Ottoman conquest of the Ra≈°ka region= During the Middle Ages, Ra≈°ka was one of the central regions of Medieval Serbia. Incursions by Ottoman Turks began in late 14th century, following the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 and the creation of the Turkish frontier march () of Skopje in 1392. The final conquest of the Ra≈°ka region occurred in 1455, when Isa-Beg Isakoviƒá, the Ottoman Bosnian governor of Skopje, captured the south-western parts of the Serbian Despotate. At first, Ra≈°ka was included in the frontier march of Skopje, the governor of which, Isa-Beg Isakoviƒá, decided to create a new stronghold near the old market site of Staro Trgovi≈°te (, literally meaning \\"old market place\\"). The new site () was therefore called Novi Pazar (, meaning \\"new market place\\"). Isakoviƒá built a mosque here, and also a public bath, a hostel, and a compound. Novi Pazar initially belonged to the Jeleƒç vilayet of the Skopsko Kraji≈°te (\\"Skopje Frontier March\\"). Other vilayets were Ras and Sjenica. By 1463, the region had been incorporated into the newly created Sanjak of Bosnia. The seat of the kadƒ± was subsequently transferred from Jeleƒç to Novi Pazar not long before 1485, and from that time the city became the most important centre in the southeastern parts of the Bosnian Sanjak. The region of Novi Pazar remained part of the Sanjak of Bosnia until 1864. =Establishment of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar= Following the promulgation in 1864 of the Vilayet Law and the reorganization of the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1865, the region of Novi Pazar became a separate sanjak with its administrative seat in the city of Novi Pazar. Initially, it comprised the kazas (districts) of Yenivaro≈ü, Mitrovi√ßa, Gusinye, Trgovi≈°te, Akova, Kola≈üin, Prepol, and Ta≈ülƒ±ca. Initially, the Sanjak of Novi Pazar belonged to the Vilayet of Bosnia, prior to becoming a part of the newly established Kosovo Vilayet in 1878. It included most of the present day Sand≈æak region (named after the Sanjak of Novi Pazar) ‚Äì also known as Ra≈°ka ‚Äì as well as northeastern parts of Montenegro and some northern parts of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica). =Congress of Berlin (1878)= Political situation in 1878 At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Andr√°ssy obtained, in addition to the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak continued to separate Serbia from Montenegro, and it was envisaged that the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika aimed at \\"bring[ing] the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence.\\" \\"High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an ...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective.\\" > On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to > resign if the army, behind which stood the Archduke Albert, were allowed to > advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament held on 5 > November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be > impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East > Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by > 179 to 95. The gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy were raised > by the Opposition rank and file. On 10 October 1878 the French diplomat Melchior de Vog√º√© described the situation as follows: > Particularly in Hungary the dissatisfaction caused by this \\"adventure\\" has > reached the gravest proportions, prompted by that strong conservative > instinct which animates the Magyar race and is the secret of its destinies. > This vigorous and exclusive instinct explains the historical phenomenon of > an isolated group, small in numbers yet dominating a country inhabited by a > majority of peoples of different races and conflicting aspirations, and > playing a role in European affairs out of all proportions to its numerical > importance or intellectual culture. This instinct is to-day awakened and > gives warning that it feels the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a > menace which, by introducing fresh Slav elements into the Hungarian > political organism and providing a wider field and further recruitment of > the Croat opposition, would upset the unstable equilibrium in which the > Magyar domination is poised. This Austro-Hungarian expansion southward at the expense of the Ottoman Empire was designed to prevent the extension of Russian influence and the union of Serbia and Montenegro. =Ottoman administrative changes= Administrative divisions in 1907, with the sanjaks of Pljevlja and Sjenica in the northwest, and showing the city of Novi Pazar belonging to the Sanjak of Pri≈°tina In order to counter the Austro-Hungarian influence in the region of Ra≈°ka, the Ottoman government made a new administrative change: the Sanjak of Novi Pazar was removed from the Bosnia Vilayet and attached to the Kosovo Vilayet, established in 1877. Further administrative changes soon followed. In 1880, the entire western part of Novi Pazar Sanjak was reorganized and a separate Sanjak of Pljevlja was established there, which included the kazas (districts) of Pljevlja (its seat), Prijepolje, and the mundirate (branch office) in Priboj; these were places where Austro-Hungarian garrisons were located. Another important administrative change was made in 1902, when the kaza (district) of Novi Pazar was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Sanjak of Pri≈°tina, and the rest of Novi Pazar Sanjak was reorganized as the Sanjak of Sjenica, which included the districts of Sjenica (its seat), Nova Varo≈°, Bijelo Polje, and Lower Kola≈°in (part of modern Bijelo Polje and Mojkovac municipalities). This move was not welcomed by the Slavic Muslims of Novi Pazar, since they saw it as a demonstration of disrespect and mistrust on the part of the central Ottoman authorities. Following the Turkish Revolution in 1908, some democratic changes were introduced into the local political life, allowing the participation of non-Muslim leaders (Christian and Jewish) in local administrative bodies (mejlis). =Withdrawal of Austro-Hungarian garrisons in 1908= At the beginning of 1908, Austria-Hungary announced its intention of building a railway through the Sanjak towards Ottoman Macedonia. This caused an international uproar. In negotiations with Russia, however, the Austro-Hungarians indicated they would be willing to vacate the sanjaks of Pljevlja and Sjenica in exchange for recognition of the annexation of Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Austro-Hungarian garrisons were withdrawn from the region in 1908, following Austria-Hungary's formal annexation of the neighbouring Ottoman vilayet of Bosnia, which had also belonged de jure to the Ottoman Empire until 1908, but been under Austro-Hungarian military occupation since the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. =Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913) and the end of Ottoman rule= In the aftermath of the Ottoman defeat during the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì1913, the territory of the Ottoman sanjaks of Pljevlja, Sjenica and Pri≈°tina were divided between Serbia and Montenegro under the terms of the Treaty of London (1913), with the region of Pljevlja becoming part of Montenegro and those of Sjenica and Novi Pazar, together with the rest of the Pri≈°tina Sanjak, becoming parts of Serbia. Population The Sanjak of Novi Pazar was mainly populated by Slavic Muslims (Islamized South Slavs, Slavized Muslim Albanians), Serbs (Eastern Orthodox Christians), and some Albanian Muslims and Turks.

The Sanjac of Novipazar was an American band, inspired by fellow parody-rock acts, The Fugs and The Mothers of Invention. It was led by pianists Deborah Greene and Tobias Mostel, and supported by drummer Tony Bartoli, bassist Jeff di Lorenzo, and guitarists Jerry Blaine, Bruno Blaine, and Mikey Push. Between 1967 and 1968, the band made frequent appearances on Bob Fass's WBAI show Radio Unnameable and performed at small venues throughout New York City as well as at the Woodstock Sound-Outs festival in 1968.

Beijing is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. History Dragon boat racing dates back about 2000 years ago and remains a traditional event held around China every year. There is evidence that Cuju, the prototype to football, was invented in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC before it spread all over the world to form the modern game. From the Song dynasty onwards, T'ai chi ch'uan and similar qigong martial arts activities became popular in China. Modern sports appeared in China at the beginning of the 20th century, largely under the influence of the American YMCA and Chinese reformers interested in adopting and adapting physical education models from the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The People's Republic of China (PRC) emphasizes sports and the government funds and trains talented youngsters into professional players, especially beginning in the mid-20th century. Ping pong is one of the biggest amateur recreational sports with an estimated 200 million players. Badminton is also well established and popular. According to CCTV Sports Channel, the gold-medal women's volleyball game of the 2004 Summer Olympics drew the viewership of 30% of TV-owning households; the figure was 18% for the China vs. Brazil match in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Football and basketball are also shown on TV. Popular amateur sports include table tennis, badminton, martial arts, and various forms of pool. China's professional sports are in its developmental stages. They also may consist of hacky sack, or ping pong during their free time. Types of sports =Football= Cuju, an ancient form of football from China Football earns the highest television ratings of any sport in the country and has been one of the most well supported sports in China ever since it was introduced in the 1900s. There is also written evidence that a game similar to football, Cuju, was first played in China around 50 BC. The current Chinese Football Association (CFA) was founded in the PRC after 1949. Its headquarters is located in Beijing, and the current chairman is Cai Zhenhua. From 1994 to 2004, the CFA established the first professional football league, which was \\"Jia A\\". The Chinese Super League (CSL) is the premier football league in China, which was changed from \\"Jia A\\" in 2004, as the top of a league hierarchy that extends to four leagues. Jia in Chinese also means \\"First\\" or \\"Best\\". Since its foundation the Super League has been relatively unstable, and has struggled to maintain popularity. In 2016, the average attendance of the CSL was 24,159 making it one of the highest attending professional football league around the world. At the international level, Chinese football has enjoyed little success despite the amount of support it receives from fans. Although the national team qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, they failed to score a single goal and lost three group matches. Conversely, the women's national team has finished second at both the World Championships and the Olympic Games. Despite the Chinese women's team's success at international competitions, however, women's football in China does not receive nearly as much attention as their counterparts in Canada and the United States, therefore China's good trend in women's football may well come to an end in the near future. In 1991, China hosted the inaugural Women's World Cup in Guangzhou; in 2004, it hosted AFC Asian Cup. Football has always been among the more popular amateur team sports for recreation in China. High schools often have football facilities, some of which are rented on weekends to local amateur teams to organize matches. It is also the most popular sport to watch on television, with large international tournaments such as the World Cup and the European Championships, as well as major European leagues receiving widespread coverage. Lin Dan is the only player in badminton history to have won three consecutive titles at the World Championships (2006, 2007 and 2009).https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iBp5mncI42R4crQcytni_kCHMmxA China national bandy team with Ukraine at the 2016 World Championship =Badminton= Badminton is popular in China thanks to its relative simplicity in recreational use and inexpensive equipment. Many Chinese badminton players have gained international success and fame, especially the many Gold medalists at the BWF World Championships. It is a popular recreational, and professional sport, with amateur leagues throughout the country. =Bandy= China started a bandy development programme by organising educational days in √úr√ºmqi in June 2009.China on the way into the bandy family They did not come as planned to the 2011 Asian Winter Games. However, China national bandy team debuted in the 2015 Bandy World Championship. Harbin hosted Division B of the 2018 tournament.[http://men.chinabandy.com/en/ 2018 WORLD BANDY CHAMPIONSHIP MEN B-GROUP] A picture of the team based in Harbin is available online. The China women's national bandy team made its World Championship debut in 2016. Chengde hosted the 2018 tournament.[http://women.chinabandy.com/en/ BANDY WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP WOMEN ,2018] China has announced its intention to participate in both the men's and women's tournament of the 2019 Winter Universiade. In terms of licensed athletes, it is the second biggest winter sport in the world. =Baseball= Baseball was first introduced in 1864 with the establishment of the Shanghai Baseball Club by American medical missionary Henry William Boone. Organized baseball games were established with a game between the St. Johns University and the Shanghai MCA baseball club in 1905. However, in 1959 Mao Zedong disbanded all the teams and outlawed baseball. After the Cultural Revolution ended, baseball activities restarted, and the China Baseball Association formed in 1974. In 2002, the China Baseball League was formed and in 2019 China National Baseball League. China participates in the World Baseball Classic. Defeats of the national team to Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea may help change the trend as Chinese become more aware of the game's internationalization. =American football= American football leagues such as the American Football League of China and the China Arena Football League have been launched in recent years. =Basketball= Houston Rockets superstar Yao Ming China hosted the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.The Official website of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, FIBA.com, Retrieved 9 March 2016. The game was introduced to China by American YMCA workers in 1896, just five years after Canadian-American James Naismith invented basketball in 1891 while working for the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Since Yao Ming's 2002 arrival in the NBA, basketball has become increasingly more popular. According to the Chinese Basketball Association, there is a record number of around 300 million active basketball players in China. The largest audience for an event outside of China was drawn at the Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian matchup when 100‚Äì200 million Chinese watched live. China's first professional team was started in Shenyang and sponsored by the Anshan Steel Company. The CBA was established in 1995, and by 2008 it had expanded to 18 teams. The fact that the United States is starting to notice Chinese players after Yao Ming's success (compared to Wang Zhizhi and Mengke Bateer), and young CBA players such as Yi Jianlian and Sun Yue entering the NBA are a testament to basketball's increasing popularity. In 2008, Sun Yue became the latest Chinese to join the NBA by signing with the Los Angeles Lakers to a two-year contract. =Bodybuilding= Bodybuilding was introduced to China in the 1930s, before being banned in 1953 and making a reappearance in 1983 when the ban was officially lifted. =Boxing= Boxing in China first appeared in the 1920s. Professional boxing is followed by some fans in China. =Chess= Women's World Chess Champion Hou Yifan (2007) China had a good result in the 2006 37th Chess Olympiad in Turin when the men's team came second behind Armenia and the women's team third for the best result overall. The Chinese progress has been underpinned by large government support and testing competition in numerous tough events. Commensurate with its status, China currently has seven hundred players, second only to Russia. However, even today countries like Russia and Israel still have an edge in experience over their Chinese counterparts. Xiangqi is also considered a sport in China, with millions of players nationwide. There is a national Chinese chess league. =Cricket= Cricket is a fast-growing sport in China. It is already a well- established sport in Hong Kong, a former British Colony. The Chinese cricket team is the team that represents the country of the People's Republic of China in international cricket. The Chinese Cricket Association became an International Cricket Council affiliate member in 2004. The Special administrative region of Hong Kong is a member of the ICC in their own right, becoming an ICC associate member in 1969. Hence, players from Hong Kong are not eligible to represent China in international competition. Prior to the establishment of a recognized national side, the Shanghai Cricket Club, the largest club in the country, played games against many touring sides but they do not receive official recognition from the Chinese Cricket Association. Since September 2005, the Chinese Cricket Association has conducted 8 coaching/umpiring training courses under the assistance from the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). They're promoted in 9 cities in China, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Tianjin and Jinan. More than 150 schools were involved. In 2006, the Chinese Cricket Association set itself ambitious goals over the next 14 years: *2009: Have 720 teams across the country in a well-organized structure *2015: Have 20,000 players and 2,000 coaches *2019: Qualify for the World Cup *2020: Gain Test status =Curling= Although generally unheard of and unpopular, curling has been an improving sport for China to play. The government selected athletic individuals to play curling for China. The Chinese teams both Men and Women have improved at the international level. At the 2008 Ford World Women's Championships, the Chinese curling team consisting of Zhou Yan, Liu Yin, Wang Bingyu, and Yue Qingshuang won a surprising silver medal finish. At the 2008 World Men's Curling Championship, the Chinese didn't have as much success, but they also did very well, finishing 4th. The government is also hoping to promote the sport through Universities and Colleges. In March 2009, China became the first Asian team to win a curling world championship by beating Sweden in the final. At the 2010 Winter Olympic Games the women's team won the bronze medal, defeating Switzerland in 10 ends. =Field hockey= The China women's national field hockey team won silver at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as bronze at the 2002 Women's Hockey World Cup. Also, the team won the 2002 Hockey Champions Trophy and finished second in 2004 and 2006. =Figure skating= Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo are considered by many critics of the sport to be one of the best pair skating teams of all time. Since the 1990s, China has been one of the top nations in the pairs events of figure skating. Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo were very famous figure skating pair in China that received widespread media coverage during their career; they were three-time world champions and won a gold medal in Vancouver Winter Olympics 2010. Comparatively, China is weak in the other three disciplines (men's singles, ladies' singles, and ice dancing). =Golf= Golf tournaments in China include the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai, TCL Classic in Sanya on Hainan island, the Volvo China Open and the BMW Asian Open, played in the PRC. The most successful Chinese male golfer has been Zhang Lian-wei. The most successful Chinese female golfer is Feng Shanshan. The Mission Hills Golf Club golf course at Guanlan in Shenzhen is said to be the world's largest. At the amateur level, golf is seen as the top recreational sport for businesspeople and officials. Because of their relatively high position in Chinese society, they are usually the only people with access to the sport of golf on mainland China. At the 2007 National People's Congress, caving in to the popular acknowledgment that the building of new golf courses is not only a waste of public funds but an illegal use of space, Premier Wen Jiabao said in his Work Report to the Congress that contracts in building new golf courses should be highly discouraged and Communist party officials are banned from playing. =Ice hockey= Ice hockey is a minority sport but growing in popularity. The Kunlun Red Star is a professional team that plays in the Kontinental Hockey League since 2016. =Kickboxing= Kickboxing promotions such as Kunlun Fight have been started in recent years. Wu Lin Feng is also a long running promotion. =Motor racing= The Formula 1 Grand Prix is held in the shanghai international circuit. The Macau Grand Prix is held since 1954, known for its Formula 3, touring car and superbikes races. Macau was transferred to China in 1999. The first international motor race in mainland China was the 1994 edition of the 3 Hours of Zhuhai, held at the Zhuhai Street Circuit as a round of the 1994 BPR Global GT Series. The Chinese Grand Prix is a Formula One event that has been held at the Shanghai International Circuit since 2004. The same circuit has hosted the 6 Hours of Shanghai, a round of the FIA World Endurance Championship, since 2012. Ma Qinghua became the first Chinese driver to win an FIA World Championship race when he won the second of two races at the 2014 FIA WTCC Race of Russia, his debut meeting in the World Touring Car Championship. Ma had previously become the first Chinese driver to drive an F1 car at a Grand Prix meeting when he drove in the first free practice session for the HRT Formula 1 Team at the 2012 Italian Grand Prix. =Rugby union= Rugby union is becoming a more popular sport in China, than it previously has been. However, it is still not overly popular. China became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1997 and is currently ranked 67th in the world. The national team has not qualified for a world cup so far. One segment of Chinese society where rugby is particularly popular is the military. Rugby is an official sport of the People's Liberation Army, with the PLA Sports Institute participating in the highly competitive Hong Kong leagues. Notable Chinese rugby players include Zhang Zhiqiang (\\"Johnny Zhang\\"), who had a stint with the famous Leicester Tigers club in England, and promising young speedster Li Yang, who boasts a time of 10.6 seconds in the 100-meter sprint. =Snooker= Ding Junhui is the first Chinese snooker player to win a ranking tournament and the Masters. Although pool or, more specifically, billiards, has long been a popular street recreation sport in China, snooker's popularity has increased over the last few years in China. It can partly be attributed to the ascension of Ding Junhui who was once the number one ranked professional player and reached the final of the 2016 World Snooker Championship. More and more young Chinese players are breaking onto the professional circuit such as Liang Wenbo and Liu Chuang who both qualified for the last 32 of the 2008 World Snooker Championship, with Liang going on to reach the quarterfinals, where he faced a snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan. Snooker is played by an estimated 50 million Chinese people, and there are now over 300 snooker clubs in Beijing alone. China hosts several major professional ranking snooker tournaments. =Speed skating= There are six indoor speed skating arenas (Changchun, Daqing, Harbin, Qiqihar, Shenyang and √úr√ºmqi). Three of the outdoor ovals were opened in 2012 (Fukang, Karamay, and Wangqing). =Table tennis (ping pong)= Ping pong () is the official name for the sport of table tennis in China. Apart from the national representative team, the table tennis community in China continues to produce many world-class players, and this depth of skill allows the country to continue dominating recent world titles after a short break during the 1990s. The overwhelming dominance of China in the sport has triggered a series of rules changes in the International Table Tennis Federation and as part of the Olympics. Ma Long is currently one of the highest-ranked Chinese table tennis players, and the highest-ranked player in the world. Deng Yaping is regarded by many as one of the greatest table tennis players of all time, along with Zhang Jike, Liu Guoliang, and Kong Linghui. The sport played an important role in China's international relations; in April 1972, the U.S. table tennis team were invited to visit China, an event later called \\"Ping-pong diplomacy\\". Table tennis is the biggest amateur recreational sport in China with an estimated 300 million players. =Tennis= Li Na is the first player from China and Asia to win a Grand Slam title. Tennis is a growing recreational sport in China, although access to courts can be limited in densely populated urban areas. Recently Chinese tennis players, especially women, have seen success internationally both at the amateur level and professionally. International tennis tournaments receive wide coverage on Chinese sporting channels, being the third most popular after football and basketball. =Volleyball= Volleyball arrived in Asia in 1908 and was officially introduced to China in 1910. The Chinese Volleyball Association represents China in the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Volleyball and the Asian Volleyball Confederation, as well as the representing the volleyball sports in the All-China Sports Federation. The China women's national volleyball team is one of the leading squads in women's international volleyball, having twice won the Olympic title (1984 and 2004). China took five consecutive World titles in the 1980s, the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup in 1981 and 1985, and the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship in 1982 and 1986. Although it experienced unstable development in the 1990s, the team won the 2003 FIVB World Grand Prix, captured the gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics, claimed the 2015 FIVB World Cup, and finished second at the 2013 FIVB World Grand Prix and the 2014 FIVB World Championship. The China men's national volleyball team represents China in international volleyball competitions and friendly matches. The team twice took part in the Summer Olympics, finishing in eighth place at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, and 5th place in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Since 1956, the men's national team has taken part in eleven World Championships, with its best results in Italy (1978) and Argentina (1982), where it finished seventh. The team also placed ninth three times, in France (1956), the Soviet Union (1962), and Czechoslovakia (1966). In 2002 in Argentina, China was 13th as a new rebuilding phase got off the ground. China took part in the opening edition of the top-class Volleyball World League in 1990 and regularly participated between 1992 and 1997, finishing sixth in 1996. Competitive results =Overview= Back in March 1959, at the 25th World Table Tennis Championships held in Germany, the table-tennis player Rong Guotuan won the first world title in China's sporting history. It was followed by many more successes. By the end of 2004 Chinese athletes had altogether won 1,800 world championships and broken 1,119 world records. In the 16 years since 1989, Chinese athletes have won 1,446 world championships, accounting for 80.3% of the total, and had broken 737 world records, making up 65.9% of the total. It was a period when China's competitive sports developed continuously and rapidly. At the 2008 Olympics, China made its best ever Olympic showing, with a tally of 100 medals, including 51 golds, 21 silvers and 28 bronzes, coming first in the medals table, achieving a major breakthrough in China's sporting history. The results in competitive sports were down to a training system which is constantly being perfected. It is based on youth amateur sports schools and basic-level clubs, with teams representing localities as the backbone, and the national team at the highest level. The training system ensures that China elite teams maintain a year-round squad of some 20,000 athletes. =Olympic Games= In July 2001, Beijing finally succeeded in its bid to bring the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (BOCOG), established at the end of 2001, set the themes for the 2008 Games as \\"Green Olympics\\", \\"high-tech Olympics\\" and \\"Humanistic Olympics\\". Seven venues, including the National Stadium and the National Swimming Center have ushered in a new period of contemporary architecture for Beijing. The centerpiece of the 2008 Games was \\"the bird's nest\\" National Stadium. With a capacity of 91,000 spectators, the stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies as well as track-and-field events. Since 1949, China has participated in eight Summer Olympics and nine Winter Olympics, winning 385 medals at the Summer Olympics and 44 medals at the Winter Olympics. At the Los Angeles, Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, China came fourth in the gold medals table, second at the Athens & London Olympics, and first at the Beijing Olympics. =Asian Games= =National Games= =Anti-doping= In 2004, the State Council published its Anti-Doping Regulations, which have been in force since March 1, 2004. National fitness The \\"Physical Health Law of the People's Republic of China\\" was adopted in 1995. In the same year, the State Council promulgated the \\"Outline of Nationwide Physical Fitness Program\\", followed by a series of rules and regulations. A survey released by the State Physical Culture Administration indicates that at present 33.9% of the population between 7 and 70 exercise regularly and 60.7% of the urban population go to sports clubs to engage in fitness activities. It is expected that by the end of 2005, 37% of China's total population will participate in regular physical exercises, and that over 95% of students will meet the National Physical Exercise Standard. Aiming to improve the health and the overall physical condition of the general population, the Nationwide Physical Fitness Program, with an emphasis on young people and children, encourages everyone to engage in at least one sporting activity every day, learn at least two ways of keeping fit and have a health examination every year. In this 15-year-long program, the government aims to build a sport and health-building service system for the general public. There are about 620,000 gymnasiums and stadiums across China, open to and widely used by the public. Outdoor fitness centers have been installed in urban communities in public parks, squares, schoolyards, and other convenient locations. All communities and neighborhoods in Beijing are equipped with fitness facilities that meet the national standard. Building on what it already had, Tianjin has instituted large-scale expansion of its outdoor and indoor fitness facilities and stadiums. 2004 saw the completion of China's first large fitness arena with a floor area in excess of 10,000 m2. Starting in 2001, the State Physical Culture Administration has set aside the proceeds of the sports lottery as pilot funds, in order to build \\"China Sports Lottery Nationwide Physical Fitness Centers\\" as pilot projects in 31 large and medium- sized cities throughout the country, including Dalian, Beijing and Changchun. Some of these centers have already been built. Meanwhile, some 196 million yuan of sports lottery proceeds were used to construct public sporting facilities in China's less-developed western areas and in the Three Gorges region of the Yangtze River, supporting 101 counties and towns. With the increase in nationwide fitness activities, people's outlook on life has also changed. In many large and medium-sized cities, spending money in the pursuit of good health has become trendy. New sports such as rock climbing, horsemanship, bungee jumping, bowling, skateboarding, women's boxing, shuffleboard, taekwondo, and golf are particularly popular among young people. At the end of 2003, work was started on China's first snow golf course in A'er Mountain, Inner Mongolia. This project, representing an investment of about 1 billion yuan, will be the sixth snow golf course in the world. The Nationwide Physical Fitness Program has set targets that, by 2010, about 40% of China's population will participate in regular physical exercise, there will be a clear improvement in the national physique and a major increase in the number of fitness sites so as to satisfy people's needs for keeping fit. Between 1990 and 2002 the average life expectancy of China's population increased by 3.25 years, reaching 71.8 years, approaching the level of moderately developed countries. The latest survey of the national health, which ended in October 2001, extended over three years and 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, making it China's largest ever in terms of scale and population numbers. The survey showed an increase in the growth of children and teenagers in China's rural areas, every index showing an average rate of increase surpassing that of same age group children in the cities. But the survey also revealed some grounds for concern. Chinese people's physical faculties drop sharply after they turned 40. In cities obesity poses a big threat to the health of children, teenagers, and adults. The health of women in rural areas is far from satisfactory. Based on the survey findings, relevant departments of the government continuously study methods of keeping fit, set new ways and standards for different age groups and strengthen instruction at community level. Youth sports Schools have professional physical educators and exercise facilities and students failing to reach the required physical standards are not allowed to go on to higher schools. Spring and autumn sports meets are annual events. The National Middle School Games and National University Games are held every four years. Promising teenagers are sent to amateur sports schools to receive specialized training. There are also many youth sports clubs. In recent years, using sports lottery proceeds, the State Physical Culture Administration has established some 500 juvenile sports clubs a year. There were some 3,000 such clubs by the end of 2005. Because Chinese athletes generally start their sporting careers at a young age, some receive little education and often struggle to find a job when they retire, with a 2012 study of the State General Administration of Sports learning that almost half the sportspeople failed to find employment. The government body then started to organize retraining courses to help them learn new skills and get jobs. Traditional sports It is common for Chinese people to play xiangqi, or Chinese Chess, in public. Traditional sports with distinct Chinese characteristics are also very popular, including martial arts, taijiquan (shadow boxing), qigong (deep breathing exercises), xiangqi (Chinese chess), weiqi (known as \\"Go\\" in the West) and Mahjong. Taijiquan is a kind of Chinese boxing, combining control of breath, mind and body. It emphasizes body movement following mind movements, tempering toughness with gentleness and graceful carriage. Qigong is a unique Chinese way of keeping fit. It aims at enhancing health, prolonging life, curing illness and improving physiological functions by concentrating the mind and regulating the breath. There are various entertaining and competitive sports activities in the minority-inhabited areas, for example, wrestling and horsemanship among Mongols, Uygurs and Kazaks; Tibetan yak racing; Korean \\"seesaw jumping\\"; crossbow archery among the Miao, and dragon-boat racing among the Dai ethnic minority. Xiangqi and weiqi were two of the five sports featured at the 2008 World Mind Sports Games held in Beijing. Sports business Since the 2010s, Chinese corporations like China Media Capital, CITIC Group, Fosun International and Wanda Group have invested heavily in international sports businesses, including marketing and media companies like Infront and MP & Silva, and teams like City Football Group, Aston Villa F.C., Wolverhampton Wanderers, RCD Espanyol, Atl√©tico Madrid, Inter Milan, SK Slavia Prague, FC Sochaux and ADO Den Haag. Sports industry stages China's sports industry has gone through three stages. The first was the Exploratory Stage, from 1978 to 1992. The second was the formative stage, from 1993 to 1996. The third is the development stage, from 1997 to the present.

It is based on the book Esta√ß√£o Carandiru by Dr. Drauzio Varella, a physician and AIDS specialist, who is portrayed in the film by Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos. Carandiru tells some of the stories that occurred in Carandiru Penitentiary, which was the biggest prison in Latin America. The story culminates with the 1992 massacre where 111 prisoners were killed, 102 by Police. The film was the last thing for which the prison was used before it was demolished in 2002, one year before the release of the film. Babenco states that Carandiru is the ‚Äúmost realistic film [he‚Äôs] ever made\\", presenting a new kind of Brazilian realism inspired by Cinema Novo (not only is it meant to portray different sides of Brazil, but it was also shot on location and used many actual prisoners as actors). Due to this focus on portraying reality and the film's memoir inspiration, Carandiru can be read as a docudrama or as a testimony from the prisoners. Plot This episodic story is set in S√£o Paulo's notorious prison Carandiru, one of Latin America's largest and most violent prison systems. Carandiru tells the stories of different inmates at SƒÅo Paulo's Carandiru Penitentiary through the filter of Dr. Varella, who goes to the prison to test the inmates for HIV. Similar to many Brazilian crime films, Dr. Varella narrates Carandiru, however, it is not his story that is told. He (like Buscap√© in City of God) acts as a filter for the stories of those that cannot speak. The inhumane conditions of the prison, such as the 100 square foot cells inhabited by sometimes up to 16 prisoners, are shown, as well as the lack of control that the guards have. Order in the prison is entirely controlled by the prisoners themselves, which leads them to face problems such as murders, rampant drug use, and disease all within the prison. Several stories are developed, ranging from drug addiction to murder to family struggles to romance. Some of the more memorable stories are Lady Di (a trans female) and No Way's marriage, Deusdete and Zico's family dynamic, Ezequiel and Zico's crack addictions, and Majestade's ‚Äúaffairs.‚Äù The prisoners are humanized to the audience by telling their stories, which makes the riot and the Carandiru Massacre even more painful for the audience to watch. Thus, when the film ends with real shots of Carandiru Penitentiary's demolition, Babenco employs catharsis. Themes =Innocence= At one point during the film, Ebony sarcastically asks Dr. Varella if he's noticed that all the inmates of Carandiru are innocent. All the inmates do see themselves as innocent, which speaks to the idea that the prisoners see themselves as people forced into crime. In this sense, Carandiru employs Dr. Varella as a social mediator who listens to all versions of the prisoners' truths, allowing the audience a glimpse into their world, prompting the audience to see the incarcerated from a different perspective. By giving the prisoners a voice, Carandiru gives the prisoners a chance to tell their stories without facing judgment. =Morality= The theme of morality plays very closely to the theme of innocence in Carandiru. While some of the characters are literally innocent, others (who are guilty) commit their crimes for potentially moral reasons. Deusdete (who has no history of crime) shoots one of the men who raped his sister. Another example is Majestade, who takes the blame for his wife's crime. Majestade, though guilty of having two wives that only sort of know about each other (and are not very happy with that), is not guilty of arson and attempted murder (which is what he is in prison for). =Law systems= While the focus of Carandiru is humanizing the prisoners, it still emphasizes the flawed Brazilian legal system and the prisoners' own legal system. Deusdete, who murders a man for raping his sister, originally wants to report the rape to the police. However, his friends advise him not to, because the police will not take his allegation seriously, and will not look to punish the rapists. Thus, Deusdete feels the need to take matters into his own hand, creating his own ‚Äúlegal system.‚Äù The idea of creating a ‚Äúlegal system,‚Äù or ‚Äúprisoner code of honor‚Äù fascinates Babenco, who stated that the code of honor was one of the most interesting aspects of the film. This highlights a problem rampant in the post-colony ‚Äì that of indirect government in both the streets and the prisons. =Brutality vs. Civilization= The focus on unfair law systems comes into play during the actual massacre during the climax of the film. The prisoners end their revolt and surrender all their makeshift weapons at the request of the prison warden. However, the police force storms the complex anyhow, killing hundreds of defenseless prisoners. The police are illustrated as monsters, killing simply to kill, forcing the audience to question whether the police or the prisoners are more civil. With that, Carandiru illuminates that Brazil has two civilizations, both of which are brutal: those who live under the governmental law and those who live under their own set of laws.

Critical reception Roger Ebert, critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, appreciated the realism of the drama, and wrote, \\"Hector Babenco's Carandiru is a drama that adds a human dimension [a] ...Dantean vision. Shot on location inside a notorious prison in S√£o Paulo, it shows 8,000 men jammed into space meant for 2,000 and enforcing their own laws in a place their society has abandoned. The film, based on life, climaxes with a 1992 police attack on the prison during which 111 inmates were killed...[the film] is a reminder that although Carandiru has disappeared, prison conditions in Brazil continue to be inhuman.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago sun-Times, film review, May 28, 2004. Last accessed: December 31, 2007. Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times, liked the film and its social message, and wrote, \\"Despite its confusion and the broadness of many of its strokes, the movie belongs to a Latin American tradition of heartfelt social realism in which the struggles of ordinary people assume a heroic dimension. The film is undeniably the work of an artist with the strength to gaze into the abyss and return, his humanity fortified.\\"Holden, Stephen. The New York Times, film review, \\"Inside a Notorious Prison, Fires of Rage and Regret,\\" May 14, 2004. Critic Jamie Russell wrote, \\"Making his point without resorting to liberal hand-wringing, Babenco charts the climactic violence with steely detachment. Brutal, bloody, and far from brief, it's shocking enough to make us realise that this jailhouse hell really is no city of God.\\"Russell, Jamie. Ibid.

A condensed version of the information collected is available to the public via the NPI website www.npi.gov.au. Emissions The NPI records and makes publicly available the emissions from industrial facilities and diffuse sources of 93 different chemical substances to air, land and water. Objectives The objectives of the NPI are to: * Assist industry and government with environmental planning and management; * Provide the community with up to date information about pollutant emissions from industrial facilities; and * Promote waste minimisation, cleaner production, eco- efficiency and energy and resource efficiency. Sources of data Australian industrial facilities that use certain amounts of the 93 NPI substances must estimate and report their emissions directly to their state or territory environment agency annually. The state and territory environment agencies review all NPI reports for accuracy and forward the data to the Australian Government. The reports are then displayed on the NPI public website  Exemptions  The following industrial activities are exempt from the NPI's mandatory reporting requirements:NPI data  National Pollution Inventory Australian Government, Department of Environment, Australia. Accessed 2014-03-23 * Mobile emission sources (for example, an aircraft in flight or a ship at sea) operating outside the boundaries of a fixed facility * Petrol stations * Dry cleaners which employ less than 20 people * Scrap metal handling facilities that do not reprocess batteries or engage in metal smelting * Agricultural production facilities, including the growing of trees, aquaculture, horticulture or livestock raising unless it involves intensive livestock production (for example, a piggery, poultry farm or a cattle feedlot) or processing agricultural produce. During a review of the NPI undertaken in 2005, it was suggested that two industries have their exemptions lifted. They were aquaculture, and crematoria. Reasons given were for their discharges of nutrient to the sea, and mercury to the atmosphere respectively. In 2007, Environment Ministers voted against the lifting of the reporting exemption for aquaculture, despite the review receiving 12 submissions supporting the recommendation, and 5 opposing it. = Aquaculture in Spencer Gulf = This omission of the aquaculture industry from mandatory reporting is significant for Spencer Gulf, South Australia. In this region, southern bluefin tuna and yellowtail kingfish sea-cage aquaculture are the two largest industrial contributors of nitrogenous nutrient pollution to the marine environment.\\"Chapter 13 - Coastal Processes and Water Quality - Spencer Gulf Port Link Bulk Commodies Export Facility Environmental Impact Statement\\" Spencer Gulf Port Link, South Australia (2013).

He directed the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne until his death. Career Born in 1865 in Clune, Cronin began working as a miner in the area, before relocating to Melbourne in 1886 where he found a job at the Royal Botanic Gardens. His mentor at the Botanic Gardens was W. R. Guilfoyle. After ten years with Guilfoyle, Cronin was hired by the Department of Agriculture as an orchid inspector. In 1908, he took over Charles Luffman as Principal of the Burnley Horticultural College, Richmond in 1908. During his two-year term, Cronin focused on pruning and hybridisation. One of his students here was Olive Mellor, who became a prominent landscape architect and gardening writer. Cronin resigned as Principal in mid-1909 to become Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, succeeding Guilfoyle. Unlike his predecessor, Cronin was strictly a horticulturist and did not concerned himself with other matters like landscape design. During this period he built strong links with the gardening public, and carried out experimental breeding of ornamental flowers including tree dahlias and Watsonia plants. Many of the flowers that Cronin bred, which bloomed in spring and were named after places in Australia, were released in the 1920s, most of which remain extant, albeit nameless. He was also President of the Victorian Horticultural Society. Later years and death Cronin remained as Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens until his death. After a brief illness in early 1922, Cronin relapsed and died in July 1923. He was survived by his wife and their three daughters and two sons.

When he is not treating the poor in his free clinic, he is in his laboratory experimenting. Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst), the father of Jekyll‚Äôs fianc√©e Millicent (Martha Mansfield), is suspicious of the young doctor‚Äôs intentions and often irritated by his tardiness and highmindedness. \\"No man\\", Carew observes, \\"could be as good as he looks.\\"Quotations of dialogue in this page's summary of the plot are transcribed from the 1920 film's intertitles. Following dinner one evening, Carew taunts his prospective son-in-law in front of their mutual friends and debates with him about the causes and effects of a person's personality, insisting that every man is fundamentally composed of two \\"selves\\" who are in continual conflict. \\"A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses\\", instructs Carew. \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Dr. Jekyll with his fianc√©e Millicent (Martha Mansfield)Reflecting on Sir George's comments, Jekyll begins his research and experiments into separating the two basic natures of man, the good and the evil. Finally, after much trial and error, he develops a potion that rapidly transforms him into a hideous, evil counterpart, a man he refers to as Edward Hyde. When in the form and consciousness of Hyde, Jekyll is not recognizable as himself, so to facilitate his bad side's access to his own home and adjacent laboratory, the doctor informs his trusty servant Poole (George Stevens) that Mr. Hyde is to have \\"full authority and liberty\\" at the residence. Utilizing his potion, Jekyll literally begins to live a double life: the compassionate and gentlemanly doctor by day, and the lustful, hunchbacked \\"creature\\" who ventures out largely at night. As Hyde, he lurks about the seediest parts of London, frequenting opium dens, bars, and music halls‚Äîanywhere he can satisfy his \\"dark indulgences\\". He rents a small furnished room in the area and brings Gina (Nita Naldi), a young woman and exotic dancer, to live with him. Soon, however, Hyde tires of her company and forces her to leave.Mr. Hyde with owner of music hall (Louis Wolheim) where Gina dances Although Jekyll has developed a counter-potion that transforms Hyde back to the doctor‚Äôs original appearance and character, each time he takes the potion to become Hyde, the beast becomes increasingly more vile and physically more hideous. Meanwhile, Millicent worries about the absence of her fianc√©, so Sir George calls on Jekyll, but the young man is not at home. Sir George then encounters Hyde in a nearby street, where the brute has just knocked a small boy to the ground and injured him. To make recompense for his actions, he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy's father. Carew notices that the check has been signed by Dr. Jekyll. He confronts Poole who tells him the story of Edward Hyde. Hyde now returns to the lab; drinks the counter-potion and changes once again into his original form. Sir George finds the transformed Jekyll in the lab and demands to know about his relationship with Mr. Hyde, threatening to break off his daughter‚Äôs engagement to the doctor if he does not answer his questions. The threat enrages Jekyll, so much so that the stress itself triggers his retransformation to Hyde. Horrified in witnessing the change, Sir George flees out of the lab, but Hyde catches him in the courtyard and beats him to death with his stout, club-like walking stick. Hyde then runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence there that might link him to Jekyll. After barely avoiding the police, the creature returns to the lab, where he drinks the counter-potion and reverts to Jekyll. In the ensuing days, while Millicent mourns over her father‚Äôs murder, Jekyll is tormented by the thoughts of his misdeeds as Hyde. Soon, the ingredient needed to make the counter-potion is depleted and cannot be found in all of London. Jekyll therefore confines himself to his locked lab, fearing he might become Hyde at any moment. Millicent finally goes to see him, but as she knocks on the lab's door, he begins transforming into Hyde. Before he opens the door, Jekyll consumes poison in a ring he wears, one that he had taken from Gina. Now fully transformed into Hyde, he lets Millicent in, locks the door, and grabs her in his arms. Suddenly, he starts convulsing. Millicent runs from the lab and her shouts for help attract Poole, Jekyll's longtime friend Dr. Richard Lanyon, and another friend, John Utterson. Lanyon enters the lab and finds Hyde dead, sitting in a chair. To his astonishment, he watches the creature transform into Jekyll. Discerning that his friend had committed suicide, Lanyon calls the others into the lab, where he informs them that Hyde has killed Jekyll. As the film ends, Millicent is grieving next to the body of Jekyll.

This 1920 film version used the play's concept of Jekyll being engaged to Carew's daughter, and Hyde beginning a dalliance with an attractive yet chaste dance-hall girl whom he destroys, to inject a coarse sexual undercurrent into Hyde's personality that Stevenson did not include in his novel. * Beranger's screenplay strayed further from Stevenson's novel than any of the previous silent film adaptations, depicting Dr. Jekyll as a handsome, selfless, charitable saint, so \\"beautiful\\" physically as to appear \\"almost Godlike\\". She even noted that a halo effect should appear around him in certain scenes, while the character in the novel (a much older man) had by this stage in his life indulged in many guilty pleasures and was \\"duplicitous\\" to his friends. * Beranger also has Hyde transform back into the handsome Dr. Jekyll after he dies from the poison, his profile shown in a beatific close-up, hinting that he has redeemed himself through suicide. In the novel, Stevenson has Jekyll die as Hyde and be forced to remain in \\"that damning form\\" for all eternity. * Troy Howarth notes that this was the first adaptation of the novel that elevated the (George) Carew character to such prominence in the plot, making him \\"basically a variation on Oscar Wilde's Lord Henry Wotten (from Wilde's 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray). Both men are sophisticated cads with a cynical point of view, and they both tempt the protagonists to ruin.\\" By making Jekyll into \\"an easily manipulated pawn\\", the filmmakers make him \\"less responsible for his own actions and fate\\", and more \\"sympathetic\\". In her screenplay, Beranger writes of Carew, \\"Sir George waxes eloquent in his philosophy of Hedonism\\". *Another connection to Wilde's Dorian Gray is the way Beranger has Hyde devolve into a more inhuman monster as he commits each evil deed. She noted in the script, \\"Though at first Hyde is misshapen and hideous....he is nothing like the unspeakable, vile-looking creature that he is at the end of the picture. This should be a gradual development of evil\\". (Hyde's bald head develops a strange point and his overbite becomes much more pronounced as the film proceeds.) Reception =Critical reception, 1920= In 1920, film critics in the trade media and in fan-based publications generally gave high marks to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and, not surprisingly, focused chiefly on John Barrymore. The popular trade paper Variety described the production as a \\"fine and dignified presentation\\" with an \\"excellent\\" performance by Barrymore despite what the paper viewed as the absurd nature of the plot: In the weeks following the release of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in March 1920, media reports about the box-office receipts being generated by the film and the exorbitant prices being spent by \\"movie palaces\\" to rent it attest to the production's commercial success. On April 2, for example, Variety reported that the Rivoli Theatre, a prestigious entertainment venue in New York City, was already earning \\"enormous takings\\" from its screenings of the film.\\"$10,000 for 'Jekyll-Hyde'\\", review, Variety (New York, N.Y.), April 2, 1920, p. 97, col. 1-2.

Variety also informed its readers that the Rivoli's management had paid $10,000 to the film's distributor just to rent the picture, which it noted was \\"probably a record price for a straight rental anywhere in the world\\". With regard to broader public reaction to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 1920, fan-based publications and individual moviegoers expressed more mixed reactions to the film than critics in entertainment trade papers.Mantle, Burns; and managing editors of Photoplay (1920). \\"The Shadow Stage\\", review of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Photoplay (New York, N.Y.), June 1920, p. 66-67. Internet Archive. Retrieved November 3, 2018. Some of those reviewers, like the title characters in the film, were \\"split\\", harboring both decidedly positive and negative opinions about the production. Photoplay, a widely read New York-based monthly, provides one example of such mixed reactions. In the magazine's June 1920 issue, critic Burns Mantle describes two of his friends' diametric responses to the picture. One friend praised it as \\"a perfect sample\\" of filmmaking, destined to be a \\"classic\\" in cinematic history; the other friend was appalled by it. As to his latter friend, Mantle adds that she \\"insists as strenuously that 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' gave her a most terrific attack of the blues from which she has yet to recover, nor expects to ever fully recover.\\" Mantle's own feelings about the much-anticipated release were not so clear-cut: Barrymore in full makeup as \\"ghastly\\" and evil Mr. HydeFrederick James Smith, the \\"Celluloid Critic\\" for Motion Picture Classic, another major fan publication, considered Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde \\"a finely workmanlike piece of screencraft\\".Smith, Frederick James (1920). \\"The Newest Photoplays in Review\\", Motion Picture Classic (Brooklyn, New York), June 1920, p. \\"Forty-five\\". Retrieved November 4, 2018. He did, though, caution his readers about Barrymore's appearance as Jekyll's inner beast. \\"His Hyde\\", Smith observed, \\"is a terrible being, with the most ghastly make-up we recall ever seeing in the films.\\" In fact, audience exposure to Barrymore's Hyde became a point of concern expressed in some reviews, with his screen presence threatening the mental and even physical health of the public, especially for children exposed to the actor's \\"ghoulish\\" character and the film‚Äôs possible \\"pre-natal influences\\" on expectant mothers. Whatever reservations or warnings that film critics may have expressed about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, they did not deter throngs of moviegoers in 1920 from seeing what Photoplay predicted would \\"easily become the most talked of picture of the time.\\" The magazine illustrated that popularity when it reported, \\"A door and two windows were broken by the crowds that tried to see it on its first showing in New York\\". =More recent assessments= In 2014, American film critic and historian Leonard Maltin gave this version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde three stars on a four-star rating scale. Maltin also complimented Barrymore's performances as both Jekyll and Hyde, as well as the film's overall production, describing it as \\"well made\\".

Similarity scores are among the many original sabermetric concepts first introduced by Bill James. James initially created the concept as a way to effectively compare non-Hall of Fame players to players in the Hall, to see who was either on track to make the HOF, or to determine if any eligible players had been snubbed by the selection committee. For example, if the most similar players to a non-HOFer were all in the Hall of Fame, one could effectively argue that that player should be in the Hall. More recently, similarity scores have been used to determine career paths and projected statistics for players. The logic behind this line of thought is simple: players often follow similar career trajectories to their most similar players, so the historical similar players' performance in years after the active player's current age should be a good predictor of that active player's future production. An example of this would be the Football Outsiders' discovery that all but the highest caliber of wide receivers suffer a marked decline after their seventh season in the NFL, a fact that bore out for the receivers selected in the 1996 NFL Draft when their production collectively slipped.Aaron Schatz, \\"Hard Times for the Class of '96\\", FootballOutsiders.com (July 8, 2004). Many baseball analysts have augmented James' method over the years, or come up with their own system of measuring similarity. Baseball Prospectus employs a projection system developed by Nate Silver known as PECOTA which applies nearest neighbor analysis to calculate similarities between players from different eras. Pro Football Prospectus (written by Football Outsiders) has their own system (dubbed \\"KUBIAK\\" after longtime Broncos backup quarterback Gary Kubiak) for projecting future performance. John Hollinger developed a similar system for basketball players in his Pro Basketball Forecast series of books, and several APBRmetricians have expanded on his methodology. Similarity scores are also used extensively in many statistical forecasting programs.

Overview Past U.S. presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson have been described as liberal hawks for their roles in bringing about the US's status as the world's premier military power. The Clinton Doctrine can also be considered as consistent with this vision. Today the term is most frequently used to describe liberals and leftists who supported or still support the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorized by the United States Congress and ordered by president George W. Bush. The war has stirred heated controversy among all political sides of the debate. The American left was divided over the issue of whether going to war in Iraq was the right decision, as some liberals felt that they should support the war, in accordance with the philosophy of liberal internationalism, which had caused them to support military intervention in the past. One document often cited as promoting a liberal hawkish point of view is Progressive Internationalism: A Democratic National Security Strategy, published by the Progressive Policy Institute in October 2003.

Kaplan by that point had renounced his prior support, but the general consensus among the participants was that, despite the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the war had still been justified on humanitarian grounds. In his book The Good Fight, published in 2006, Peter Beinart renounced his prior support for the Iraq War, saying, \\"I was too quick to give up on containment, too quick to think time was on Saddam's side.\\" Notable people associated Harry S.

The continuator of the Ecclesiastical History of Bar Hebraeus mentions several contacts between Denha II and the Jacobite church in Karamlish between 1358 and 1364. At this period Karemlash had Jacobite and Armenian communities alongside its Nestorian majority, and its village chiefs styled themselves 'emirs'. The prosperity enjoyed by the village during the reign of Denha II presumably came to an end when the patriarchate was relocated to Mosul at an unknown date in the fourteenth or fifteenth century.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 218‚Äì19 Post Iraq War Karemlash was relatively calm following the US-led Iraq War.

The massacre, which left 111 prisoners dead, is considered by many people to be a major human rights violation. Incident The massacre was caused by a prisoner revolt. Around 13:30, two groups got into a fight after a game of football; the fight quickly escalated into a prison riot that lasted three hours. Prisoners were reported attacking each other with knives and pipes.Brooke, James. ‚Äú111 Killed When Police Storm Brazilian Prison During Inmate Riot.‚Äù The New York Times.

The conflict consisted of 2,069 prisoners against 15 guards, resulting in the guards quickly losing control of the prisoners.WorldCourts (2000).Carandiru v. Brazil,http://www.worldcourts.com/iacmhr/eng/decisions/2000.04.13_Carandiru_v_Brazil.pdf. Retrieved 23 January. Around 14:15, the prison director, Dr Jos√© Ismael Pedrosa, informed the local military police Pol√≠cia Militar do Estado de S√£o Paulo about the uprising. The military was given full command of the prison when arriving about 14:30. Though the director wanted to negotiate with the prisoners by a megaphone, he was held back by his staff since the police almost crushed him. The prisoners were stripped, locked in their cells and shot. Other prisoners were killed by police dogs. The police released their dogs in the barber shop, where the wounded prisoners were taken. The facility was a detention center, not a penitentiary, meaning that the inmates have not been tried or convicted. By the end of the day, 111 prisoners were dead; and 37 more were injured. Ballistic evidence implicated that 515 bullets were found in the prisoners. Furthermore, gunshot wounds were mainly found in the face, head, throat and chest. Hands among the dead were found in front of the face or behind the head suggesting defensive positions. No policemen were injured.Brooke, James. ‚Äú111 Killed When Police Storm Brazilian Prison During Inmate Riot.‚Äù The New York Times. October 04, 1992. Accessed March 29, 2018.  Aftermath  The country was in major shock from the massacre. The case was brought before the inter-American Commission by The Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL), the Teot√¥nio Vilela Commission for Human Rights, and Human Rights Watch, and in 2000, eight years after the massacre, they condemned Brazil for it. In 2013, hundreds of people attended a multi-faith vigil in S√£o Paulo in memoriam of those killed in the massacre. Relatives of those killed and human rights activists have both demanded and appealed for justice. The vigil and pleas for justice led to several trials for the officers involved in the massacre that same year. The commanding officer of the operation, Colonel Ubiratan Guimar√£es, was initially sentenced to 632 years in prison for his mishandling of the rebellion and the subsequent massacre. He was in charge of the special police unit ROTA that is known for having an aggressive approach to civil disturbance.Willis, G. D. (2002). The Killing Consensus: Homicide Detectives, Police that Kill and Organized Crime in Sio Paulo, Brazil. On 16 February 2006, a Brazilian court voided Guimar√£es' conviction because of mistrial claims; the court accepted his argument that he was only \\"following orders\\". Guimar√£es, who was also a member of the S√£o Paulo state legislature, was assassinated in September 2006. Although not entirely certain, his death appears to be the result of his role in the massacre. Another direct result of the riot and the handling of the riot was the unification of prisoners. One of Brazil's most notorious gangs, the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), is said to have formed in 1993 as a response to the event. The surviving gang members joined forces with other prisoners to provide protection against the police. The group is believed to be responsible for the death of Jos√© Ismael Pedrosa, the director of the prison at the time. After years of national and international pressure, the prison was demolished on 8 December 2002, the former complex has been transformed into a park. The massacre also gained international attention. An example of this is the New York Times, which published one article captioned \\"111 Killed When Police Storm Brazilian Prison During Inmate Riot\\" the same year as the massacre. The massacre also received attention from BBC with several articles in the last several years dealing with the vigils and the trials. The massacre has also sparked ongoing discussions, both in Brazil and internationally about Brazil's prison system. In 2017, the New York Times published an article captioned \\"Brazil‚Äôs Deadly Prison System\\". Human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch have also documented statistics of police violence and acquittals in Brazil.  Trial  In April 2013, 23 policemen involved in the massacre were sentenced to 156 years in prison each for the killing of 13 inmates. In August 2013, another 25 policemen involved in the massacre were sentenced to 624 years each for the deaths of 52 inmates. In April 2014, 15 additional policemen were sentenced to 48 years. Although the UN urged Brazil to bring justice to those most affected by the slaughter in September 2016, the court declared the trial on Carandiru massacre null. The court judged that the massacre was an act of self-defense and that there was a lack of evidence to link the individual officers to the individual killings. Consequently, the prosecutor is initiating an appeal and the process remains ongoing. None of the officers convicted have served their sentences.‚ÄúAppeal Begins in Brazil against acquittal of 74 police.‚Äù BBC News. September 29, 2016. Accessed March 29, 2018. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37502941. Since the massacre, Brazil's federal government has passed new legislation to reform the prison system, all of which has yet to be enforced.

Practitioners study how the environment of residential, commercial and public buildings can affect the health of the occupants, producing a restful or stressful environment. Important areas of building biology are building materials and processes, electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and radiation (EMR) and indoor air quality (IAQ).IBE. A German medical doctor Hubert Palm has been considered the 'father' of Baubiologie,https://www.erziehungskunst.de/en/article/the-third- skin-of-human-beings-an-outline-of-modern-building-biology/ but did attract controversy over his view of steel framed and concrete buildings.https://izgmf.de/scripts/forum/index.php?mode=thread&id;=66327 According to the Building Biology Institute (BBI) and the Institute of Building Biology and Sustainability (IBN), there are 25 principles which govern the decision making of building biologists. These principles are broadly grouped into the following categories by the BBI: Site and Community Design, Occupant Health and Well-Being, Natural and Man-Made Electromagnetic Radiation Safety, and Environmental Protection, Social Responsibility and Energy Efficiency. The IBN uses the following five categories in guiding the creation of healthy, environmentally sustainable and community-connected buildings: Healthy Indoor Air, Thermal and Acoustic Comfort, Human-Based Design, Sustainable Environmental Performance, and Socially Connected and Ecologically Sound Communities. Effects of poor building After World War II, new houses were rapidly built in Germany to accommodate the growing population. StudiesIBN of these new houses found an unusual patterns of illnesses. It was concluded that these patterns could be attributed to the rapid construction of the buildings. The rapid construction had given materials insufficient time to outgas various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and these VOCs instead harmed the occupants. The illness is also attributable to problems with the electrical systems of the homes. From these discoveries a studyMaes began in earnest among a few individuals to catalog and characterize these VOCs. What emerged was a Standard of Baubiologie Method of Testing, with recommended threshold guidelines for sleeping areas, where one is most susceptible and spends a large amount of time. A small cadre of individuals was formed, and Anton Schneider, Wolfgang Maes and the Institut f√ºr Baubiologie und Nachhaltigkeit IBN started a training system in Building Biology. The 'Building-biological Measuring Standard'(see above) relies on physiological impact on biological systems, when determining threshold values. This is in difference to most government standards that use thermal impact (for microwaves) and other quantifiable measures, as advised by the relevant industries. This explains, why the recommended threshold values of the Building-biological Measuring standard are considerably lower than the values advised by government standards. Architect Helmut Ziehe, Dipl.Ing., graduate of the original Baubiologie training, introduced Building Biology to the United States. In 1987, he founded the International Institute of Building Biology & Ecology (IBE) (http://buildingbiology.net), now operating at Building Biology Institute (BBI) (http://buildingbiologyinstitute.org), which presently offers seminars in building biology. Four trademarked certification streams are available: Building Biology Advocate (BBA), Building Biology Environmental Consultant (BBEC), Electromagnetic Radiation Specialist (EMRS), and Building Biology New-build Consultant (BBNC). Mr. Ziehe's non-profit environmental education organization is now in its thirty-first year of continuous operation, under a volunteer board of directors. Another Graduate of the original Baubiologie training and also Architect, Reinhard Kanuka- Fuchs, introduced Building Biology to New Zealand. In 1990, he founded the Building Biology and Ecology Institute of New Zealand. During the 1990s The New Zealand Institute continued to deliver the original Baubiologie training. In the year 2000, Reinhard passed the directorship of the New Zealand Institute to Alexander Greig. The original training then slowly evolved into an on-line course \\"Certificate in Ecological Building and Design\\" This new course was edited and compiled mainly by Jenny Rattenbury. The three groups of most sensitive individuals that reap the greatest benefits are: Infants, the elderly, and the immuno-compromised. Some people become environmentally hypersensitive, and although conventional medicine suggests that the problem(s) may be psychological, there is growing acceptance that there is an environmental cause. One aspect of this problem is known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS).See MCS referral service at http://www.mcsrr.org/resources/articles.htmlJohnson, Allison, ed., Casualties of progress, Personal histories from the Chemically sensitiveKipen H., W.

Viewers will learn about great low cost travel, cooking, assignments, electronics and more. *Command Performance: Features military journalists talking with today's top entertainers for conversations with a uniquely military perspective. An updated revival of a 1940s radio program of the same name. The Pentagon Channel also showed programming direct from the services such as, Freedom Journal Iraq, Freedom Watch Afghanistan, Army Newswatch, AFN Korea Nightly News, AFN Europe Report, Pacific Report, Eye on Nellis, The American Veteran, Air Force Space Today, In Step with Fort Riley and On Track with Ft. Hood, as well as live Department of Defense briefings and roundtables. With the change to DoD News Channel, most of the non-news programming was either dropped or de-emphasized. Podcasting In April 2006, the Pentagon Channel launched its podcasting initiative, having offered up to 27 podcasts via the iTunes Store and its website. American Forces Press Service The American Forces Press Service (AFPS) was the news service provided by the Defense Media Activity (formerly the American Forces Information Service), part of the United States Department of Defense. It supplied news stories pertaining to the activities of the U.S. military around the world. The New York Times has described it as the Pentagon's \\"media branch\\" or \\"internal news service\\". AFPS was shuttered in a 2015 internal realignment of the Defense Media Activity and its reporting was merged with that of other DMA DOD-level production activities into a new organization named DOD News. DOD News was in turn shuttered during a 2018 internal realignment. DOD-level reporting of the type formerly done by AFPS and DOD News reporters is now credited to Defense.gov. AFPS, DOD News and Defense.gov reporting uses a modified version of Associated Press style.

He is best known for his record three interceptions in Super Bowl XV, which put him on the cover of Sports Illustrated. High school career Martin went to Hamilton High School, a year ahead of NFL hall of fame quarterback Warren Moon. College career Before his NFL career, Martin played college football at the University of Southern California (USC), where he was a 1976 All-Pac-10 selection. Prior to USC, Martin played at Los Angeles City College. Professional career Martin was one of the top linebackers in the NFL during his 12 seasons and made the Pro Bowl twice during his career, in 1983 and 1984. Selected in the twelfth round of the 1977 NFL Draft, Martin was initially a tweener, undersized for a Linebacker and slow for a Safety, but eventually bulked up to 220-225. In 1978, his second year, Martin started 8 games, filling in at Inside LinebackerPro-football-reference.com By 1979, he settled in at the weak-side LB spot, becoming a mainstay on the Raider defense, assisting the Silver & Black to two Super Bowl victories (1980, 1983 seasons) and having an outstanding performance in each one. In Super Bowl XV, Martin recorded a Super Bowl record three interceptions from Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski, and returned them for 44 yards. His interceptions were not only a Super Bowl record, but they also tied linebacker Chuck Howley's record for career Super Bowl interceptions. Among these players, Martin is the only one to record all 3 of his interceptions in one game. In Super Bowl XVIII, Martin broke up a third down pass on his own 7-yard line in the second quarter, sacked Joe Theismann once, tackled Washington Redskins hall of fame running back John Riggins for no gain on a fourth down and one conversion attempt deep in Raiders territory on the last play of the third quarter, and recovered a fumble in the final period. In his 12 NFL seasons, Martin recorded 14 interceptions, which he returned for 225 yards and 4 touchdowns, along with 10 fumble recoveries, which he returned for 122 yards and two touchdowns. He also recorded 33 and a half official sacks (sacks were not an official statistic until 1982, Martin's 5th season). Personal Martin has returned to work at USC, where he is a programmer and manager of technical and user support services in the Information Sciences Institute. Martin has two daughters: Jessica, who played volleyball at Bethune-Cookman University, and Jade, a softball player who attended Morgan State University.

History Blessing of Holy Rosary Cathedral, 1913 Construction began in 1912 and the cornerstone was blessed by the Apostolic Delegate to Canada, Archbishop Peregrin-Fran√ßois Stagni, O.S.M. on 30 June 1913 before an assembly of approximately 2,000 people. The building was completed in 1917. It was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by the firm of Joseph Fortin of Montreal, who also designed the Roman Catholic cathedrals of St. Paul's in Saskatoon and Our Lady of Assumption in Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan. Modelled after churches in northern France, it is faced in yellow brick with limestone accents. Smith Brothers & Wilson oversaw construction and the final cost was $135,000. Casavant Fr√®res of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, constructed and installed the gallery organ in 1930, to replace a large reed organ. It underwent extensive repairs after the 1976 fire and was renovated again in 1992‚Äì1993, after which it was named The McGuigan Organ in honour of Sister Marion McGuigan, a much-loved local humanitarian and educator. Since its construction, the interior of the church has been extensively redecorated five times; in 1928, 1951, 1968, 1976, and 1992. Renovations in 1951 saw the installation of 43 stained glass windows by Andr√© Rault, while work in 1968 saw fundamental renovations for the church to conform with the directives of the Second Vatican Council. This included the dismantling of the high altar at the east end of the choir, and a nave altar being installed at the crossing. The choir was converted into a chapel. A disastrous fire occurred on 12 April 1976, forcing renovations in the months following the fire. The Cathedral was unusable and Masses were held in the neighbouring Westminster United Church. The cathedral's pipe organ, built by Casavant Fr√®res, and installed in the cathedral gallery in 1930, was damaged during the fire. It underwent extensive repairs after the 1976 fire and was renovated again in 1992‚Äì1993, after which it was named The McGuigan Organ in honour of Sister Marion McGuigan, a much- loved local humanitarian and educator. Other renovations in 1992 saw the opaque screen separating the nave from the choir removed, and the main altar restored to a position in the choir closer to the site of the original high altar in the former sanctuary. The light and airy interior of the cathedral is decorated sparingly in keeping with Canadian aesthetic sensibilities. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Holy Rosary Cathedral. Sacred Heart Academy Former Sacred Heart Academy, now converted to private residences, though it also houses diocesan offices. Immediately to the west of the Cathedral, across the closed Garnet Street, is the building that formerly housed Sacred Heart Academy, a girls' high school operated by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions, who also conducted music tuition for music students from across the city. The Sisters, whose numbers were waning, closed the school in 1969. The building has now been converted to strata title and sold as townhouses, but the Archdiocese has retained a portion of the east basement, once the piano studios, for offices.

Douglas T. Ross is considered by many to be the father of APT: as head of the newly created Computer Applications Group of the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT in 1956, he led its technical effort. APT is a language and system that makes numerically controlled manufacturing possible. This early language was used widely through the 1970s and is still a standard internationally. Derivatives of APT were later developed.  Programming language  APT is used to program numerically-controlled machine tools to create complex parts using a cutting tool moving in space. It is used to calculate a path that a tool must follow to generate a desired form. APT is a special-purpose language and the predecessor to modern computer aided manufacturing (CAM) systems. It was created and refined during the late 1950s and early 1960s to simplify the task of calculating geometry points that a tool must traverse in space to cut the complex parts required in the aerospace industry. It was a direct result of the new numerical control technology becoming available at that time and the daunting task that a machinist or engineer faced calculating the movements of the machine for the complex parts for which it was capable. Its development was centered at the same MIT labs that hosted the Numerical Control and the Milling Machine Projects. APT also was US Air Force sponsored and is notable for being the world's first major cooperative programming venture, combining government agencies, universities, and a 14-company team organized within the Aircraft Industries Association (now Aerospace Industries Association). APT was created before graphical user interfaces were available, and so it relies on text to specify the geometry and toolpaths needed to machine a part. The original version was created before even FORTRAN was available and was the very first ANSI standard. Later versions were rewritten in FORTRAN. As a U.S. government-funded project, the copyright status of work by the U. S. government placed APT in the public domain. APT shares many similarities with other computer programming languages such as FORTRAN. A general-purpose computer language takes source text and converts the statements to instructions that can be processed internally by a computer. APT converts source statements into programs for driving numerically-controlled machine tools. The output from an APT processor may be a cutter location (CL) file which is then run through a post-processor specific to the desired control - machine pair. The resulting file is then run by the control of the machine to generate tool motions and other machine actions. Most commonly, this file is in some form of RS-274 format instructions, commonly known as G-code.

The technology in BlueTec vehicles includes a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system that uses diesel exhaust fluid, and a system of NOx adsorbers the automaker calls DeNOx, which uses an oxidizing catalytic converter and diesel particulate filter combined with other NOx reducing systems. The BlueTEC was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 2007 and 2008. In February 2016, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, Bosch LLC and Bosch GmbH were sued by private plaintiffs alleging BlueTec violates standards in a manner similar to the Volkswagen emissions scandal. On December 6, 2016 U.S. District Judge Jose L. Linares dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, finding the plaintiffs had alleged no standing. The case was reinstated after Plaintiffs amended the complaint, and the litigation is ongoing. Uses Daimler introduced BlueTEC in the Mercedes E-Class (using the DeNOx system) and GL-Class (using SCR) at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. At that time, these BlueTEC vehicles were 45- and 50-state legal, respectively, in the United States (a 45-state vehicle does not meet the more stringent California emission standards that have also been adopted by four other states). Daimler AG has entered into an agreement with Volkswagen and Audi to share BlueTEC technology with them in order to increase the Diesel passenger-vehicle market in the United States. VW introduced the Jetta Clean TDI, the Tiguan concept, and the Touareg BlueTDI as part of the BlueTec licensing program. The Jetta and the Tiguan use NOx adsorbers, while the Touareg uses a Selective Catalytic Reduction catalytic converter. In August 2007 VW Group announced that cooperation on BlueTEC with Daimler AG would end. The reasoning for this change is due to the recognition of the VW TDI branding. VW did not want to use a competitor's branding for a product they would introduce into the market. VW developed their own system, but it failed and they re-programmed the engine control to show false values during pollution tests. By 2010 a BlueTEC version of the Mercedes Sprinter was released. The BlueTEC systems allowed the elimination of much of the EGR in that vehicle's engine, which as a result gives compared to the non-BlueTec engine's . Daimler Trucks uses BlueTEC on all its Freightliner and Western Star Trucks destined for highway use, as these vehicles are only available with diesel engines. Rationale The BlueTEC system was created because the properties of the Diesel cycle that give diesel engines higher fuel efficiency also lead to relatively higher emissions of certain pollutants compared to Otto cycle engines. High compression ratios and lean air-fuel mixtures make high combustion temperatures, which results in more nitrogen oxides being produced during the combustion. While the particulate matter can be controlled with higher injection pressures and particulate filters, the big challenge is limiting NOx; Tier 2 regulations in the US are 0.07 grams per mile of NOx, which is ‚Öõ of the 0.40 limit in the European Union. Process The emissions system works in a series of steps: # A diesel oxidation catalyst reduces the amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) released from the exhaust. # A DeNOx catalytic converter begins a preliminary removal of oxides of nitrogen. # A particulate filter traps and stores soot particles, burning them off when the filter gets full. # If the above are not sufficient to meet the prevailing emissions regulations, a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalytic converter will convert the remaining nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and water; so-called diesel exhaust fluid (solution of urea and water) is injected into the exhaust gas stream to enable the conversion. In order to prevent vehicles from breaking emissions regulations, the engine may go into a limp-home-mode if the DEF tank is depleted; drivers are instructed to keep the tank refilled as necessary. Some commercial vehicles are equipped with a request or inhibit switch which allows the DEF injection to be \\"postponed\\" as it can reduce power output and increase temperatures temporarily; if the vehicle is climbing a grade, for example, it may be necessary to delay the cycle. Emissions defeat device allegations The Netherlands' official automobile inspector TNO, on behalf of the Dutch Minister of the Environment, conducted an on-road tests of a C-Class Mercedes C220 CDi BlueTec diesel and determined it emitted more than 40 times the amount of cancer-causing NOx than in the lab test.http://publications.tno.nl/publication/34616868/a1Ug1a/TNO-2015-R10702.pdf The tests were done at temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius (50 ¬∞F). Mercedes says it is permissible for the BlueTec engine to emit 40 times more NOx when the temperature is less than 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F).http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/mercedes-manipulationsverdacht-bei-der- c-klasse-a-1075185.html As of 2016 April 22, Mercedes-Benz USA disclosed it is under investigation by the Department of Justice for potential discrepancies over its diesel emissions certifications, according to a Daimler statement. The DOJ effectively told MBUSA to begin an internal investigation \\"to review its certification and admissions process related to exhaust emissions in the United States,\\" Daimler said. The company \\"has agreed to cooperate fully with the DOJ.\\" In Feb 2018, German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that US authorities investigating Mercedes have discovered that its vehicles are equipped with illegal software to help them pass United States' stringent emission tests. The claimed defeat devices include a \\"Bit 15\\" mode to switch off emissions after 16 miles of driving (the length of an official U.S. emissions test), and \\"Slipguard\\" which tries to directly determine if the car is being tested based on speed and acceleration profiles. Bild am Sonntag said it found emails from Daimler engineers questioning whether those functions were legal.

It is internationally known as Cabo Blanco in Spanish or Cap Blanc in French (both meaning \\"White Headland\\"). In the 14th and 15th centuries, fishing activities carried out from the nearby Canary Islands, by Spanish fishermen, inspired Spain to develop an interest in the desert coast of what is today called Western Sahara. Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is the only place in the world where Mediterranean monk seals form a true colony. In 1997, two- thirds of the colony died off, but there has been gradual recovery since.  Geography  The headland forms the western limit of Dakhlet Nouadhibou Bay. This thin stretch of land is divided between Mauritania and Western Sahara. On the western side lies the ghost town of La G√ºera; on the eastern side, less than from the border, lies Mauritania's Nouadhibou (formerly Port Etienne).  History  Portuguese sailing explorers first reached the location they called Cabo Branco in 1441. The Spanish interest in Western Africa, in the desert coast of the Sahara, resulted from fishing activities carried out from the Canary Islands by Spanish fishermen, who also hunted and traded seal. The Spanish fished and whaled off the Sahara coast from Dakhla to Ras Nouadhibou from 1500 to the present, ranging from whaling humpback whales and likely North Atlantic right whales and whale calves, mostly in Cape Verde, the Guinea gulf in Annobon, and the S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe islands. These fishing activities have had a negative impact on wildlife and caused the disappearance or endangerment of many species of marine mammals and birds.http://fis.com/fis/worldnews/search_brief.asp?l=s&id;=47446&ndb;=1&monthyear;=&day;=&country;=194&df;=1http://sahara- news.webcindario.com/actividad_flota_pesquerasahara.pdf The Spanish originally claimed the land from 20¬∞ 51' N (near Cap Blanc) to 26¬∞ 8' N (near Cape Bojador) in 1885. This protectorate was governed from the Canary Islands in 1887. France would later claim the Western Sahara. At a joint convention held in 1900, the French and Spanish settled the boundary, dividing the area between Spanish Sahara and French West Africa. International Boundary Study, Algeria-Western Sahara 1968 Today, the same border separates Western Sahara from Mauritania. However, the western side is currently policed by Mauritania, as neither Morocco nor the Polisario Front occupies the area. A lighthouse was constructed on the cape in 1910. Monk seals A monk seal colony on Ras Nouadhibou in 1945 A seal swims at Ras Nouadhibou The Mediterranean monk seal's (Monachus monachus) former range extended throughout the Northwest Atlantic Africa, Mediterranean and Black Sea, coastlines, including all offshore islands of the Mediterranean, and into the Atlantic and its islands: Canary, Madeira, Ilhas Desertas, Porto Santo, as far west as the Azores. Vagrants could be found as far south as Gambia and the Cape Verde islands, and as far north as continental Portugal and Atlantic France. Today, the cape hosts the largest surviving single population of the species, and the only remaining site which still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, two-thirds of its seal population were wiped out within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided (the most likely cause being a morbilivirus or, more likely, a toxic algae bloom,) the mass die-off emphasized the precarious status of a species already regarded as critically endangered throughout its range. While still far below the early 1997 count, numbers in this all-important location have started a slow-paced recovery ever since. Currently, the population in this location is estimated at 270 individuals, down from some 310 in 1997, but still the largest single colony by far. The threat of a similar incident that could wipe out the entire population remains. In literature Captain James Riley's captivity memoir, Sufferings in Africa (1815), recounts his and his men's experiences after beaching their ship at what is thought to be Cabo Blanco. Robert Adams's Narrative recounts a similar experience. The Pharaon from The Count of Monte Cristo sinks between here and Cape Bojador. Cape Blanco is mentioned briefly in the novel Moby Dick.

It is operated by a custom console that produces the tapping of ancient stalactites of varying sizes with solenoid-actuated rubber mallets in order to produce tones. The instrument's name was derived from the resemblance of the selected thirty-seven naturally formed stalactites to the pipework of a traditional pipe organ along with its custom organ-style keyboard console. It was designed and implemented in 1956 over three years by Leland W. Sprinkle inside the Luray Caverns near Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, USA.  History  This postcard from 1906 illustrates the method of early lithophone performances in Luray Caverns Two accounts of Sprinkle's conception of the instrument are known. From the discovery of Luray Caverns in 1878 onward, the favorable attributes of the formations for creating musical tones were well known. One of the earliest references to performances of lithophone music in Luray Caverns comes from the tour led by co-discoverer Andrew Campbell for a group sent by the Smithsonian Institution in 1880. According to a summary of the report incorporated into the earliest printed guides to Luray Caverns, Campbell surprised the group by playing a tune on a formation, probably the one that came to be known as the Organ. By the early 20th century, performances of folk tunes, hymns, and other well-known pieces were a regular part of guided tours. According to the modern guided tour, Sprinkle is said to have conceived the idea for the Great Stalacpipe Organ during one of these performances when he toured Luray Caverns on his son's birthday in 1954. A variation of the story of the instrument's conception is that Sprinkle's son Robert hit his head on a stalactite, producing a tone that inspired Sprinkle to invent the instrument. This account is the one published in a Meccano Magazine article from 1961 and in an article in the 1959 Rosicrucian Digest.http://audioindy.com/artist.cfm?loader=4&user;=12299  Construction  Sprinkle created the Great Stalacpipe Organ over three years by finding and shaving appropriate stalactites to produce specific notes. He then wired a mallet for each stalactite that is activated by pressing an associated key on the instrument's keyboard. The stalactites are distributed through approximately of the caverns but can be heard anywhere within its confines. The organ console was constructed by Klann Organ Supply of Waynesboro, Virginia. The original console design featured volume-control switching cylinders actuated by pedals and ranks of draw-knobs designated \\"Pedal,\\" \\"Harmonic,\\" \\"Solo,\\" and \\"Echo\\" which altered the amplifier settings, but this feature was subsequently removed in favor of the aesthetics offered by amplifying every note at a constant level. The organ can be heard throughout the caverns without use of the loudspeaker system, though it is not typically operated this way when open to the public.  Recordings  Sound of Stalacpipe Organ During its first three decades, vinyl records (both 7-inch 33 rpm and 45 RPM) of the Great Stalacpipe Organ were sold in the Luray Caverns gift shop. These early recordings featured Sprinkle at the organ manual. Later recordings of Sprinkle's performances were sold on cassette tape before organist Monte Maxwell created his own arrangements and recordings of the organ which are currently sold on CD at Luray Caverns. While earlier gift shop recordings were created live during a performance of the organ, Monte Maxwell's recording was produced via sampling; the tracks on this release are the result of using a synthesizer to create each song from the original samples. Some details about this process are available in the booklet which accompanies the CD. (CD album entry on allmusic.com) In 2011, the Finnish/Swedish music collective Pepe Delux√© became the first artists to write and record an original composition on The Great Stalacpipe Organ.

History =Early years and debut album (1997‚Äì2003)= Since the band's inception, they have had around five guitarists and three different bassists, have been a three-piece, four-piece, and a five-piece. Due to a lack of a dedicated music scene in the Huntsville area, the band decided to start touring the country in 2000. They booked their first tour, bought a van, and set out on the road. After two years of booking, promoting, and producing everything themselves, the band signed a deal with Triple Crown Records of New York City in June 2002. By this point, the only original member in the band was drummer Gabe Renfroe. Their line-up solidified with Nick Torres on lead vocals and guitar, Tyler Odom on guitar and Shawn Reagan on bass. The band released their debut album Is This Thing Loaded? in October. It was promoted with a few headlining shows in October, before joining The All-American Rejects and Motion City Soundtrack on their tour in November. After this, the band went on tour with Taking Back Sunday and the Starting Line in November and December. In April, the band appeared at the Skate & Surf Fest, followed by a tour with Senses Fail in May, and contributed the track \\"To My Better Angel\\" to the soundtrack of Beer: The Movie. In July, the band supported Rx Bandits on their tour. In September and October, the band supported Rufio and Motion City Soundtrack on a co-headlining cross country tour. They toured for over a year until Jake Fisher replaced Reagan. =Pollyanna, break-up and subsequent events (2004‚Äì2008)= The group released their second album Pollyanna in April 2004. Following this, they went on tour with Moneen in April and May, before going back on tour again in June with Piebald and the Jealous Sound. The band then appeared on select dates of the 2004 Warped Tour. The band also made a brief visit to the UK with Modest Mouse. In October and November, the band went on tour with Hot Rod Circuit, Say Anything and Straylight Run. Following this, they went on hiatus in December and later re- grouped in February 2005 for a co-headlining tour with Lucero. They were supported by the Honorary Title, Circa Survive and Communiqu√©. The band then broke up on April 11, citing \\"personal reasons\\"; they performed at The Bamboozle festival the following month. A video album The Uncomfortable Camera appeared in June, and included the band's music videos on the release's second disc. Torres and Odom created Cassino; the demos for it were recorded with Matt Squire and used drummer Will Noon of Straylight Run. A collection of demos and alternate recordings, entitled Broken Parachute, has been announced by Nashville-based Speak Music Media in November 2005, initially as an five- track EP. It was then expanded to a nine track full-length and released on January 8, 2008. Cassino later released their debut a few months later.

In January 1976 and again in February 1976, clashes took place in Amgala between units of the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (RMA) and Polisario Front forces (SPLA), supported by units of the Algerian Army. Because of its ample supply of water, Amgala was an important place in the Saguia el-Hamra Valley and Algerian troops set up a Polisario base here where refugees could be given food and medical assistance and transported onward to Algeria. The unexpected attack by the Moroccans caused much anger as well as heavy damage, and ninety-nine Algerian soldiers were captured. An all-out war between the two countries was only avoided because of decisive action by President Houari Boumediene of Algeria. After that, Algeria withdrew its troops from the area but increased its support for the rebels. Algeria claimed that their forces were only in the area to render humanitarian assistance to Sahrawi refugees fleeing from Moroccan occupation and heading for the Sahrawi refugee camps at Tindouf, in western Algeria. Morocco said the conflict was a direct military intervention by Algeria on the side of Polisario. A second battle took place at Amgala between the 13 and 15 February 1976. On this occasion, Polissario troops defeated the small Moroccan garrison which suffered heavy casualties and were nearly wiped out. Morocco complained that the Algerians had been involved in this attack but the latter denied the claim. Another Battle of Amgala took place on 8 November 1989.

It was first described by Amin J. Barakat et al. in 1977. Presentation It is a genetic developmental disorder with clinical diversity characterized by hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal disease. Affected people usually present with hypocalcaemia, tetany, or afebrile convulsions at any age. Hearing loss is usually bilateral and may range from mild to profound impairment. Renal disease includes nephrotic syndrome, cystic kidney, renal dysplasia, hypoplasia or aplasia, pelvicalyceal deformity, vesicoureteral reflux, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria and renal scarring. Other reported features include: intellectual disability, polycystic ovaries, particular distinct facial characteristics, ischaemic stroke and retinitis pigmentosa. Genetics The defect in the majority of cases has mapped to chromosome 10p (Gene Map Locus: 10pter-p13 or 10p14-p15.1). Haploinsufficiency (deletions) of zinc-finger transcription factor GATA3 or mutations in the GATA3 gene appear to be the underlying cause of this syndrome. It causes the failure in the specification of prosensory domain and subsequently leads to increased cell death in the cochlear duct thus causing deafness. Since the spectrum of phenotypic variation in affected people is quite large, Barakat (HDR) syndrome probably arises as a low penetrance haploinsufficient disorder in which their genetic background plays a major role in the severity of the disease. Inheritance is probably autosomal dominant. Diagnosis A thorough diagnosis should be performed on every affected individual, and siblings should be studied for deafness, parathyroid and renal disease. The syndrome should be considered in infants who have been diagnosed prenatally with a chromosome 10p defect, and those who have been diagnosed with well defined phenotypes of urinary tract abnormalities. Treatment Management consists of treating the clinical abnormalities at the time of presentation and includes genetic counselling, correcting calcium, treating hearing problems, monitoring kidney function and close monitoring of cysts of the kidney. Prognosis Prognosis depends on the severity of the kidney disease. Life expectancy is unaffected if the disease is mild. Epidemiology The frequency is unknown, but the disease is considered to be very rare. Both male and females have been noted to be affected. by hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal (kidney) disease. However, specific symptoms and severity can vary. Around 65% of people with Barakat syndrome have hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and kidney disease together.

It was held that judges have a common law discretionary authority to impose publication bans on information revealed in a criminal trial. The judge, however, must weigh competing rights, such as freedom of expression and right to a fair trial, to mizzen the violation of rights. It was further held that the media has a right to appeal a decision of a publication ban. Background Four former and present members of the Christian Brothers, a Catholic order, were charged with sexual abuse of young boys while they were teachers at an Ontario Catholic school. During their trial the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced a dramatic mini-series, based on another sexual abuse scandal at Mount Cashel Orphanage, named The Boys of St. Vincent, and it was scheduled to be broadcast nationwide in the first week of December, 1992. The defence brought an application requesting the jury be charged before the airing of the show or else sequestered over the weekend of the show's airing. The judge declined and instead merely directed the jury to avoid watching the show. The day before the airing the defence applied for an injunction to restrain the CBC from broadcasting the show and from publishing any information relating to the show until the last of the four trials were over. The injunction was granted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the injunction but limited it only to Ontario and Montreal, and overturned the ban on any publicity of the show. The CBC and the National Film Board of Canada appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. Opinion of the Court The majority of the Court held that the publication ban was in violation of the freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Charter. Aftermath The Court set out a test for a publication ban to be granted, and this has since become known as the Dagenais/Mentuck test:canlii.org: \\"R. v.

NOTEWORTHY, Chicago Sun-Times, December 15, 1999, by Elliott Harris. Balukas was considered a prodigy, coming to the public's attention first at 6 years of age at a pool exhibition held at New York City's Grand Central Terminal and thereafter appearing on television, including on CBS's primetime television show, I've Got a Secret. At just 9 years old she placed 5th in the 1969 U.S. Open straight pool championship, and placed 4th and 3rd respectively in the following two U.S. Opens. From that early start, Balukas completely dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.Billiard Congress of America (1995-2005). BCA Hall of Fame Inductees: 1985 - 1991 .

Balukas won the U.S. Open seven years in a row from 1972 through 1978, accumulating six world championship titles, had well over 100 professional competition first-place finishes with 38 majors to her name, had a streak of 16 first-place finishes in women's professional tournaments, and was the only woman to compete on equal footing with men in professional play in her era. She quit the sport amidst controversy in 1988 while at the height of her ability, due to a dispute over her conduct in a match at the World Open Nine-ball Championship of that year.  Young prodigy  Jean's father, Albert Balukas, along with his partner, professional player Frank McGown, was the proprietor of a forty-eight-table pool hall called the Ovington Lounge in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas's introduction to play was at 4 years of age, not on one of her father's tables but on a 4-1‚ÅÑ2 by 9 foot pool table in the cellar of her childhood home, purchased by her parents to keep her four billiards-playing brothers out of local pool rooms.The New York Times Company (October 18, 1987).

In later years Balukas explained that she \\"almost never went to the pool hall and if I did go, I didn't play. I felt uncomfortable, and besides, girls didn't go in those days.\\" Wielding an ivory- detailed cue made especially for her in 1965 by renowned cuemaker George Balabushka, at 5 and 6 years of age she would practice straight pool to 50 points after family dinners with her father's encouragement but not participation. Many have assumed that she had been tutored in the game. However, Balukas states, \\"when they find out that my father doesn't play, many people think I must have learned the game from Frank McGown. That isn't true. I taught myself to play pool.\\" In 1966, McGown staged a billiards exhibition at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he brought along the 6-year-old Balukas, where she participated in the spectacle. The attention this generated, coupled with her prodigious talent, landed her a guest appearance in 1966 on WNEW-TV's Wonderama. Later that year, Balukas, along with her younger sister Laura, appeared on CBS's popular show I've Got a Secret. None of the panelists were successful in guessing that the 7- and 5-year-old sisters were pool enthusiasts. The following year Balukas appeared in an exhibition match at the bygone Carom Club, then located at 1697 Broadway in Manhattan. A second-grader at the time, according to her mother, Peggy, she did her homework and took a nap before appearing at the scheduled match. In advertisements for the match, Balukas was billed as \\"the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards.\\" She was described by a reporter present as \\"a little girl with honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards...who resembles a young Shirley Temple.\\" To great applause she edged out her opponent, Roland DeMarco, a pool enthusiast and the President of Finch College. The final score was 50 to 42. In 1969, at 9 years of age, Balukas competed in her first Billiard Congress of America U.S. Open straight pool championship, taking 5th place among a field of adults.Billiards Digest (1999). \\"50 Greatest Players of the Century\\" by Kenneth Shouler. Billiards Digest Magazine. October 1999 issue, page 50-51 and 60. In the next two U.S. Opens, in 1970 and 1971, she placed 4th and 3rd, respectively. By that time she was already fairly well known, having had additional television appearances alongside such billiard stars and celebrities as Willie Mosconi, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Falk, Hugh Downs and Sonny Fox. She would later appear on television many more times, in addition to broadcasts of pool matches, including an interview on The Mike Douglas Show airing on January 11, 1977 with Bernadette Peters and David Niven.The New York Times Company (January 11, 1977).

Held in Rotonda, Florida, the event pitted championship athletes from one sport competing in sports other than their own specialties, vying for cash prizes totaling $69,000. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, she finished second taking titles in tennis and bowling where she won with 192 points. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included, diver Micki King, tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson, Skier Kiki Cutter, sprinter Wyomia Tyus, and Tennis champ Martina Navratilova. The second place win was bittersweet for Balukas, because based on the award of prize money for placing at Superstars ($13,100), she lost amateur standing and was thereafter banned from competing in high school sports, also becoming no longer eligible for a college athletic scholarship. Balukas has won numerous other titles including a string of six wins at the World Open Pocket Billiard Championships. Upon her first win in that tournament held at a convention hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey on August 14, 1977, she was described as \\"the 18-year-old prodigy from Brooklyn.\\" There she again outplayed Walker (then of Ithaca, New York), with a score of 100‚Äì57, and earned a $1,001 prize.The New York Times Company (August 15, 1977).

Her ball average over the seven U.S. Opens was in a different class than her opponents. Balukas averaged 3.44 in 1972 with the next best, Gloria Walker, having an average of 2.37. In 1975 she averaged 4.05, while no other player averaged even 3.  Playing with men  As early as the late 1960s, Balukas was performing exhibition matches with some of the top male players of the era, including Willie Mosconi and Irving Crane, who were together considered between 1941 and 1956 the \\"best in the world, flat out\\". In 1975, she again played the legendary Willie Mosconi on CBS' \\"Challenge of the Sexes\\" in both eight-ball and nine-ball competition. At 62 Mosconi was well past his prime, but a handicap was nevertheless given to the eagle-eyed youngster, allowing her all the breaks and the first shot regardless of whether she had made a ball or not on the break. Mosconi lost at both disciplines. She later would play televised \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" matches with Rudolph Wanderone a/k/a Minnesota Fats in 1977, Ray Martin in 1979 and with Steve Mizerak in 1986. According to a 1987 interview with reporter Roger Starr of The New York Times, she learned much about pool through such activities but \\"she also learned that, even in fun, pool stars did not like losing in public, especially not to children, and less, even, to girl children. She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'\\" On August 6, 1978 Balukas became the first woman to qualify to play in the men's division of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship; a tournament with a 100-year history. This meant that she would be competing in both the women's and men's divisions of the tournament to be held on August 12 of that year at the Biltmore Hotel located at 43rd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City.The New York Times Company (August 6, 1978).

After notable controversy (detailed below), she competed only on the men's side. Along the way she trounced Keith McCready 11‚Äì3 (at the time the 17th-ranked male player by money list, and who guest- starred as obnoxious hustler \\"Grady Seasons\\" in the 1986 film The Color of Money). Balukas finished in a tie for 9th place among many of the best players in the world.  Dress code controversy  In August 1987, at the annual B.C. Open hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for competition in both divisions. After arriving, she discovered that for evening-scheduled matches she would be required to wear formal attire that she did not have with her. The men's division, by contrast, had no similar dress code. Balukas took a stand that the women should not be treated differently from the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate. The women held a vote as to whether Balukas should be allowed to play. She later explained that \\"what hurt at Binghamton was that while I was trying to stand up for us being treated the same as men, the other girls held the tournament draw without me. By one vote, they kept me out. And some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me.\\" She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's snub and perceived chauvinistic terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place. Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was \\"thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether.\\" Soon after the dress code dust-up made headlines, a letter was sent to The New York Times by the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), by its president Belinda Bearden, disputing the facts as reported. According to the WPBA, the dress code was self-imposed by the players in an attempt to improve the image of women's pool and to attract more spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8‚Äì7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.The New York Times Company (November 27, 1987). The Best Woman in the Hall. Retrieved March 25, 2008. Note: Identically titled but different article than previously referenced NYT article.  Break with the sport  In 1988, Balukas was playing against professional Robin Bell in a televised match of the Brunswick-sponsored World Open Nine-ball Championship held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bell, who was Balukas' best friend on the women's tour, had never beaten Balukas but had been playing very strongly in the tournament. With the score 2 games to 3 in favor of Bell in a , Bell made the 9 ball two games in a row, making the score 5 to 2 in very short order. All television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience. After Bell's second 9 ball break, Balukas reportedly muttered within the range of the microphone words to the effect that Bell was having a string of inordinately lucky shots. She was cautioned by the referee and play continued, with Balukas the ultimate victor with a final score of 9‚Äì5. According to an interview with Balukas appearing in New York Woman magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were \\"Some world championship... beat me with skill, not luck.\\" Despite their off-the-table friendship, following the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors thereafter sanctioned Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct. Balukas was greatly incensed over the sanction and refused to pay on principle, turning away offers by others to pay the fine in her stead. Balukas explains that \\"It wasn‚Äôt the $200... [Women] pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, were the ones who decided I should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors.\\" The sides were at an impasse. Balukas refused to relent and the WPBA refused to lift the sanction and would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid the fine. \\"Just because she was our premier player doesn't mean she was above the rules,\\" said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Professional Loree Jon Jones in the same interview expressed mixed sentiments: \\"Her not playing is, I guess, sad,\\" but she reflected that in Balukas's absence, \\"we've all learned how to win.\\" Balukas had also felt some heat from her solo venture into the men's arena. She had heard taunts from the men upon finding out she was going to play in their division, such as \\"I‚Äôm gonna put on a dress and go play with the women.\\" In early 1988, Balukas gave in to complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago-based tournament that it wasn't fair she should have the opportunity to play in both divisions when the men only had the opportunity to play in one, and withdrew from the men's side. Balukas states that after she arrived in Chicago \\"I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women‚Äôs event were going to be invited to play in the men‚Äôs event. I was stabbed in the back.\\" There were other factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, much of it self-imposed. After she reached the pinnacle of her profession, \\"That‚Äôs when I started getting nervous... that‚Äôs when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself.\\" \\"Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [losing] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time.\\" Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport \\"...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break.\\" For Balukas's part, she returned to Bay Ridge, took over management of her family's pool hall, Hall of Fame Billiards on Ovington Avenue in Brooklyn, and states that \\"I'm enjoying my life immensely... I have moved on.\\" In summing up these events in a 1992 article, The New York Times stated, \\"So America's greatest woman pool player competes only for the odd soda. If you're feeling lucky, drop by her poolroom ... If you're thirsty ... go elsewhere.\\"  Honors  In 1975, when she was 15 years old, Balukas was already described as the \\"best female pool player in the world\\". By 1987, Balukas's dominance of women's professional pool was so complete that it was described as \\"breathtaking\\" in its scope by The New York Times. Announcers had long since stopped calling Balukas \\"the Little Princess,\\" but presented her as \\"the Queen\\". By that time she had won the World Straight Pool Championship women's division eight of the prior nine years, and over the same time period, every single women's professional tournament in which she competed ‚Äî 16 in all. She had been honored as BCA Player of the Year five times. In 1985 became the second woman (after Dorothy Wise) to be inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame, with the additional honor of being its youngest inductee, at just under 27 years of age. In 1999, Balukas was ranked number fifteen on Billiard Digest's Fifty Greatest Players of the Century.

As his escape is taking place, it becomes known to authorities that the bank vehicle containing the money, which had been driven from the robbery as part of the plan, has been recovered from a lake - with the body of the guilty bank robber/murderer inside. Eddie receives a last minute pardon and the prison chaplain, whom Eddie has always trusted, tries to convince him of this reprieve. Eddie is too bitter and disillusioned to even consider that he is a free man. Desperate to get out his way, he unintentionally kills the chaplain. He and a pregnant Joan go on the lam, hoping to make it across the border to Mexico. They become infamous and are blamed for every crime in the areas they pass through. After the baby is born, Joan manages to meet up with her former employer, Stephen, the public defender, and her sister. The two have arranged for Joan to hop a boat to Havana with the baby and wait there while Stephen works to clear her name. She refuses to leave Eddie.

In the more general usage of the term, it describes the general high church characteristics of Lutheranism in the Nordic countries such as Sweden, Finland, and the Baltics. The mentioned countries, once a part of the Swedish Empire, have more markedly preserved Catholic traditions. Background The terms high church and low church were historically applied to particular liturgical and theological groups within Anglicanism. The theological differences within Lutheranism have not been nearly so marked as those within the Anglican Communion; Lutherans have historically been unified in the doctrine expressed in the Book of Concord. However, quite early in Lutheranism, polarities began to develop owing to the influence of the Reformed tradition, leading to so-called \\"Crypto-Calvinism\\". The Pietist movement in the 17th century also moved the Lutheran church further in a direction that would be considered \\"low church\\" by Anglican standards. Pietism and rationalism led not only to the simplification or even elimination of certain ceremonial elements,Rudolf Rocholl: Gesch. d. ev. Kirche in Deutschland, s. 300 such as the use of vestments, The Proper Communion Vestments by P. Severinsen but also to less frequent celebration of the Eucharist, by the end of the era of Lutheran Orthodoxy. There has been very little iconoclasm in Lutheran churches and church buildings have often remained richly furnished. Some monasteries also continued as Lutheran after the Reformation. Loccum Abbey and Amelungsborn Abbey in Germany have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries. In old church orders, however there was much variation which could now be described as \\"high church\\" or \\"low church\\". One example of the more Catholic ones is the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571. The Agenda of the church order of Margraviate of Brandenburg (1540) contained unusually rich provision for ceremonial usages.Frank Senn: Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical, Fortress Press, 1997. p. 334. The legacy of Brandenburgian Lutheranism was later visible in Old Lutherans' resistance to compromise in the doctrine of Real Presence. Other church orders following closely to pre-Reformation rites and ceremonies were Palatinate-Neuburg (1543, retaining a eucharistic prayerLutheran Liturgies from Martin Luther to Wilhelm L√∂he by Vernon P. Kleinig, Concordia Theological Quarterly, April 1998) and Austria (1571, prepared by David Chytraeus).Frank Senn: Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical, Fortress Press, 1997. p. 331. An interesting fact is that William Augustus M√ºhlenberg, father of the Ritualist movement in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, was originally Lutheran and came from a Lutheran family.M√ºhlenberg, William Augustus - Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge In Europe, after long influence of Pietism, theological rationalism, and finally, 19th century German Neo- Protestantism, a ground for 20th-century High Church or Evangelical Catholic Movement developed. The terms \\"High Church\\" (Evangelical Catholic) and \\"Low Church\\" (Confessing Evangelical) began to be used to describe differences within the Lutheran tradition. However, this terminology is not necessarily as characteristic for a Lutheran's identity as it often is for an Anglican.Evangelical Catholics and Confessional Evangelicals: The Ecumenical Polarities of Lutheranism by Gene Edward Veith Sometimes there is a distinction made between Nordic style Lutheranism and German style Lutheranism, with the latter being more influenced by pietism and the former having both retained and later also revived more of its pre-Reformation liturgy and practices and therefore being more high church. Examples of this are well-preserved church interiors, apostolic succession, and a clear episcopal structure. Although the name Nordic is used, it is actually mostly applicable to Sweden and Finland, and to a lesser extent, to Estonia and Latvia because those countries were part of the Swedish empire and were therefore the jurisdiction of the Church of Sweden.The other Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, and Iceland were under the influence of Danish rule in which the German form is dominant. High church movements The roots of 20th-century Lutheran High Church Movement are in 19th century neo- Lutheranism, confessional Lutheranism, Anglo-Catholicism, and the Liturgical Movement. The Lutheran high church movement has been much less significant than, for example, Anglo-Catholicism within the Anglican Communion. High church Lutheranism has often been (especially in Scandinavian churches) a theologically orthodox revival movement at least among clergy, with a strong ecclesiology, standing in opposition to State church and \\"Folk church\\" ideologies, which parallel Erastianism within Anglican Church. In this respect there are resemblances to the Oxford Movement in Anglicanism. The range within High Church Movement varies across a spectrum from moderate to papalist. The Second Vatican Council led to a breakthrough for the High Church Movement, which is slowly gaining support.Nordic Folk Churches: A Contemporary Church History. By Bj√∂rn Ryman, Gunnar Heiene, Aila Lauha. Published by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2005 , p. 145 In Northern Europe, the term High Church has been often used pejoratively,H√∂gkyrkligheten i Sverige och Finland under 1900-talet by Bengt Ingmar Kilstr√∂m. Helsingborg 1990, , p. 9 and was not necessarily ever used by pioneers of the movement, who identified themselves as Catholics of the Augsburg Confession. Nevertheless, the term \\"high church\\" has established itself at least in Sweden and Germany. Especially in North America, term \\"high church\\" is avoided, because it is seen to not take seriously Lutheran confession and historical tradition as evangelical Catholic.Lutheran Ceremonia by John W. Berg. Motley Magpie Volume 1, Number 2, March 2003 The term \\"high church\\" has also been criticized by theologians like Hermann Sasse (in German context) as not to integrate itself into authentic Lutheran tradition. Among \\"low church\\" Liberal Protestant, Protestant, Confessing Evangelical, or Pietist Lutherans, Evangelical Catholic Lutheranism is seen as a violation of Reformation ideals. While the Church authorities have often by various actions tried to prevent the formation of Catholic parishes within the European State Churches, the Catholic movement has been preserved by many confraternities, religious orders, and monastic communities. It is growing in countries such as Norway.Katolsk infiltrasjon i Statskirken... - Mens Vi Venter, nr. 8, Juli/Aug. 1994 High Church movements have in some cases, especially in Northern Europe, fallen into crisis because of the issue of ordination of women. In Norway the issue has resulted in the establishment of the Nordic Catholic Church. In Germany, on the other hand, the primary issue has been the lack of historical episcopate and apostolic succession. Nevertheless, the Catholic movement has influenced whole church bodies, and in some cases has developed liberal expressions. The liturgical emphasis does not always indicate Catholic Lutheranism, because in the Lutheran Church, the Liturgical Movement apart from the Catholic movement has been influential. Thus in Europe a certain amount of \\"high church\\" interest has been based on aesthetics, tastes in paraments, vestments, and ceremonies, without any theological argumentation or sense of historical continuity. Similarly, interest in mediaeval church buildings may have no concerns regarding the theology behind the form of worship taking place within these buildings. = Sweden = Historically Sweden, including the former Swedish province of Finland, has had a more elaborate form of liturgy, which preserved more links to the medieval catholic tradition than other Nordic countries. Hence the most remarkable Lutheran high-church movement by its influence on the whole church body has been in the Church of Sweden, influenced at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries by the Anglo-Catholic part of the Church of England. The first religious order within the high church movement was the Societas Sanctae Birgittae, and it still exists. The movement spread intensively through the activity of Gunnar Rosendal, the hymn writer Olov Hartman, and the retreat director Jan Redin. The more subtle high church influence of Bishop Bo Giertz has been remarkable especially among Pietists. The early high church movement caused the emergence of retreat centres, more frequent celebration of the Mass, and lively historical-critical study of the Bible. The strong social passion of the Catholic Movement within Church of England never took root in the same way in Sweden.The Oxford Movement as Received in Sweden by Oloph Bexell. The Church Coalition for Bible and Confession - The London Conference 2006 The ordination of women as clergy began in 1958, and caused a split within the Swedish high church party. One branch with liberal leanings accepted this step while the other did not. Later, one of the leading figures of the high church movement was Bishop emeritus Bertil G√§rtner who was against the ordination of women. He was successor to Bo Giertz as bishop of Gothenburg. He died in 2009. His role in the High Church movement fell on Bishop emeritus Bi√∂rn Fj√§rstedt, the former bishop of Visby. The Svensk Pastoraltidskrift is the traditionalist journal of the High Church Movement in Sweden. The nucleus of the movement is arbetsgemenskapen Kyrklig F√∂rnyelse (Swedish Church Union) together with numerous religious societies and some monastic communities like √ñstanb√§ck monastery, Alsike Convent, and Sisterhood of Saint Francis. Other organisations include the St. Laurence Foundation, the St. Ansgar Foundation, and F√∂rbundet F√∂r Kristen Enhet, which works for the reunion of the Church of Sweden and the Roman Catholic Church. Additionally the Anglican Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament is active within the Church of Sweden, with a national cell dependent upon the English jurisdiction of the confraternity. = Germany = In Germany, the high church movement is much smaller than in Sweden. Because of several unions between Lutheran and Reformed churches since the Prussian Union, resulting in the simple spread of Calvinist concepts from the Reformed Churches by \\"osmosis\\", Lutheranism has often taken on a Reformed context. The high church movement within the Evangelical Church in Germany has been much less influential than in Sweden and perhaps less integrated to the state Lutheran tradition. Still the movement is strongly involved in ecumenism and the Liturgical Movement. The case is much different in the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Germany. This church is a confessional Lutheran church in full \\"pulpit and altar fellowship\\" (full communion) with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. Because of the confessional Lutheran direction, there is a high church movement in that Church.Video Celebrating the lord's supper in a congregation of the SELKInformation in English of Congregation in Berlin The German high church movement began in Reformation Jubilee 1917, inspired by publication of Stimuli et Clavi, 95 theses by Heinrich Hansen. This resulted in the founding of Hochkirchliche Vereinigung Augsburgischen Bekenntnisses (High Church Union of the Augsburg Confession) the following year. Subsequently, other high church associations and societies also arose, distinguished from other Lutheran bodies by restored apostolic succession (mostly through Hochkirchliche St. Johannes-Bruderschaft, which is part of the HVAB, along with the Evangelische Franziskaner-Tertiaren. The Catholic movement gained new strength by the Sammlung movement by Hans Asmussen and Max Lackmann. Other associations are Bund f√ºr evangelisch- katholische Einheit (League for Evangelical-Catholic Unity), including St. Jakobus- Bruderschaft), Arbeitsgemeinschaft Kirchliche Erneuerung in der Evang.-Luth. Kirche in Bayern (Working Group for Church Revival in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria), Humiliatenorden, St. Athanasius- Bruderschaft, Hochkirchlicher Apostolat St. Ansgar, Bekenntnisbruderschaft St. Peter und Paul, Kommunit√§t St. Michael in Cottbus, Congregatio Canonicorum Sancti Augustini, and some religious communities like Priory of St. Wigbert. Other organisations, such as Berneuchen Movement and Kirchliche Arbeit Alpirsbach are regarded as part of the Liturgical Movement, although the former is theologically high church and in co-operation with High Church associations and religious fraternities. = North America = The 19th- century Old Lutheran and also Neo-Lutheran (e.g. Charles Porterfield Krauth) influence in North America was strong. The missionary work of Wilhelm Loehe, from Neuendettelsau, Bavaria, Germany, did much to contribute to Lutheran liturgical renewal in Germany and beyond.Wilhelm Lohe's Hauptgottesdienst (1844) as Critique of Luther's Deutsche Messe by John W. Fenton, Concordia Theological Quarterly, April 2000. Loehe's influence can be seen in the Lutheran migration to Australia and North America. In North America this was seen in the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod and the Iowa Synod. The Evangelical Catholic movement was born later than the European movement. Its forerunners include Arthur Carl Piepkorn, Berthold Von Schenk, and Fr. Arthur Kreinheder. Portions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada have evangelical catholic emphases. Evangelical catholic congregations range from theologically liberal to conservative. The Society of the Holy Trinity is the largest evangelical catholic religious society in North America. Theologically, it is moderate and relatively conservative in ecumenical openness. The most ornate liturgy is to be found in the small Evangelical Catholic Lutheran Churches, some parishes of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod,Zion Evangelical-Lutheran Church in DetroitRedeemer Lutheran Church, Fort Wayne and in many Lutheran seminaries of all Lutheran varieties across North America which celebrate Solemn High Mass with ceremony similar to that found in Anglo-Catholic parishes. The Society of Saint Polycarp, a devotional guild, was also founded within the LCMS.Society of St. Polycarp - St. Paul Lutheran Church, Hamel, Illinois. The most important evangelical catholic journals are Lutheran Forum, published by American Lutheran Publicity Bureau (ALPB), and Pro Ecclesia, published by the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology in cooperation with the ALPB. Valparaiso University, an independent Lutheran institution, has also continued in its own evangelical catholic tradition. The development of this tradition is a unique blend between the movements within the various Lutheran church bodies. Students play a key role in crafting these services. Another significant contributor to the evangelical catholic values of Valparaiso University is the presence of the annual Liturgical Institute on its campus. Like some previously mentioned German religious clerical fraternities, in the United States the Evangelical Catholic Church and in recent years other small, biblically and theologically conservative high church evangelical catholic Lutheran Churches such as the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church - International, the Lutheran Orthodox Church, the Association of Independent Evangelical Lutheran Churches, the Evangelical Marian Catholic Church, and the Lutheran Episcopal Communion have succeeded in restoring the historic apostolic succession from Old Catholic churches. Additionally, some have moved from decentralized, democratic congregationalist polity to highly centralized episcopal polity; worship using the liturgies of the Roman Catholic Church exclusively; and work actively toward a form of visible, corporate reunion with the Roman Catholic Church. As is the case among Anglicans, however, \\"high church\\" movements have proven to be more attractive to the clergy than to the laity. In North America, Lutheran liturgical renewal has also been seen in such organizations as the defunct St. James Society, the journal The Bride of Christ, the journal Gottesdienst, the defunct journal Motley Magpie, the Society of the Holy Trinity, the Lutheran Liturgical Prayer Brotherhood (influenced by German Evangelisch-Lutherische Gebetsbruderschaft), the Society of Saint Polycarp, the Society for the Preservation of the Evangelical Lutheran Liturgy, and the Good Shepherd Institute at Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The most fundamental division in evangelical catholic circles is between those who are determined to remain Lutheran and those who are at least willing to consider that their catholicity might one day edge into Roman Catholicism.Turn Out the Lights? by James Nuechterlein. First Things (August/September 2001). On February 21, 2011, it became public that Catholic authorities in Rome have invited the Anglo- Lutheran Catholic Church to join the Catholic Church through the provisions of Anglicanorum Coetibus and that the ALCC has officially and unconditionally accepted that invitation.http://www.theanglocatholic.com/2011/02/our-family- is-growing/ = Other countries = The Church of Norway is generally pietistic. The Pietism movement in Norway (embodied to a great extent by the Haugean movement fostered by Hans Nielsen Hauge) has served to reduce the distance between lay and clergy in Norway. The high church movement is more isolated and much smaller than in Sweden. It has been promoted by Ordo Crucis, B√∏nne- og arbeidsfellesskapet Kirkelig Fornyelse, Pro Ecclesia, and Samr√•d p√• Kirkens Grunn. In the Church of Denmark the high church movement is marginal. It is promoted by F√¶llesskabet Kirkelig Fornyelse. Praying of the Daily office has been promoted by Teologisk Oratorium (the best-known member having been Regin Prenter) and by Selskabet dansk Tideg√¶rd. The Church of Iceland and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland have also had high church groups and interest has been expressed among both clergy and laity, though to a very small extent. After the Soviet era, in Baltic Lutheran Churches, including archbishop JƒÅnis Vanags, there has been interest to High Church Movement. In Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church the movement is promoted by a confessional Society of the Augsburg Confession.http://www.meiekirik.ee/ = Academic theology = Through ecumenism, evangelical catholic ideas have been accepted more widely in academic theology, e.g. recent ecumenical Lutheran research in the Finnish School of Tuomo Mannermaa has begun to see Martin Luther as a Catholic teacher. This school of thought includes also Carl Braaten and Robert Jenson. Roman Catholic view of Luther in research has changed to positive since Joseph Lortz. In 1976 Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) suggested that the Augsburg Confession might possibly be recognized as a Catholic statement of faith. This however did not happen.The Catholicity of the Augsburg Confession by Avery Dulles, S.J. (JSTOR, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 63, No. 4, Martin Luther, 1483-1983. (Oct., 1983), pp. 337-354.) Within evangelical catholic Lutheranism, there has been less movement towards Roman Catholicism than within Anglo-Catholicism. Owing to liberalism in Lutheran churches, some well known Lutheran theologians, such as Richard John Neuhaus and Reinhard H√ºtter, have become Roman Catholic while others, such as Jaroslav Pelikan, have joined the Eastern Orthodox Church. Theology and spirituality The aim of the Evangelical Catholics is to recover the liturgical and confessional heritage of Lutheranism in continuity with the broad tradition that includes Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and the Eastern Orthodox. The Movement stresses certain elements of the Church: Dogma, sacraments, hierarchy and ordained ministry, liturgy and continuity of the Church, all of which are traditional Lutheran theology, but were thought to have been neglected because of Pietism and the Age of Enlightenment. There is also emphasis on Catholic concept of priesthood and apostolic succession, ecumenism and Mariology. The Catholic concept of priesthood and continuity of the Church sets the movement apart from mainline Lutheranism and the ecumenical openness for some extent distincts the movement from Confessional Lutheranism. The approach to worship may also significantly vary within Confessional Lutheranism. By theological emphasis the High Church Movement may vary from one country to another. The classical manifesto of the Scandinavian high church revival program is \\"Kyrklig f√∂rnyelse\\" by Gunnar Rosendal (1935). In its beginning the German high church movement was inspired by the 95 theses \\"Stimuli et Clavi\\" by pastor Heinrich Hansen (1917). In the same way as Anglo- Catholics have esteemed Caroline Divines, the Catholic Lutherans, owing to the nature of the Lutheran Reformation, have been able to appreciate many, largely forgotten, Catholic teachings of Reformers like Martin Luther, Laurentius Petri, Mikael Agricola, George of Anhalt, Martin Chemnitz, Gnesio-Lutherans, Gerhard's Confessio Catholica etc. According to formerly Roman Catholic Friedrich Heiler, the Lutheran Church is the proper via media between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism because of its emphasis upon doctrine and because it has preserved the Catholic doctrine of the Sacrament and its liturgical traditions in purer form than the Anglican Church in the Book of Common Prayer.Friedrich Heiler and the High Church Movement in Germany by Bernard E. Meland, (JSTOR) Evangelical Catholic spirituality is characteristically more theocentric and christocentric than that of Pietist, rationalistic, and Liberal Protestant Lutheranism. In addition to the Theology of the Cross there is usually emphasis on Christus Victor, which makes it clear that Easter is more important than Good Friday. Theocentricism makes salvation history and the cycle of the church year important, from point of view of the incarnation. These stresses have created the need to give an evangelical interpretation to the sacrifice of the Mass in order to provide a more theocentric view to Real presence. E.g. in Sweden there has been discovering of Laurentius Petri's theology on the sacrifice of the Mass.Liturgy and Worship website of the Church of SwedenThe Catholic Movement in the Swedish Church by Gunnar Rosendal According to Wilhelm Loehe, \\"the whole of Lutheranism is contained in the Sacrament of the Altar. Here all of the chief doctrines of Christianity, especially those highlighted by the Reformation, have their focal point.\\"Wittenberg and Canterbury by John Stephenson, Concordia Theological Quarterly, April‚ÄìJuly 1984 In evangelical catholic spirituality the Mass is thus considered the heart of Christianity as it encapsulates the one, but eternally efficacious, sacrifice of Christ on Calvary. One divide within high church Lutheranism is in the matter of the direction of the liturgy. Some follow the understanding of liturgy as \\"work of the people\\" whereas others follow the understanding of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article XXIV which states that the liturgy is not a sacrifice but squares with the public ministry. A common hallmark of this divergence is the preference of the term \\"Divine Service\\" for the liturgy of Holy Communion (from Gottesdienst, Gudstjaenst, Jumalanpalvelus) among those who see the liturgy as chiefly the service of Christ for the Church. This divergence in liturgical theology is also manifested in debates on the eucharistic prayers, the epiclesis, and the role of the laity in the liturgy. The praying of the Divine office is also characteristic to high church Lutheran spirituality. Confession as a sacrament is part of Lutheran tradition and is not considered unique to \\"high church\\". A small number of evangelical catholic congregations reaffirm Melanchthon's wider use of the word \\"sacrament\\" (in the Apology and in Loci Communes) by considering Holy Matrimony, Unction, Confirmation, and Holy Orders to be Sacraments. = Liturgical practices = Formal liturgy based on the western Catholic Mass with varying degrees of chanting, the use of organ music, crucifixes, silver chalices, hosts and the use of vestments for Holy Communion has always been characteristic of Lutheran worship. The use of hosts has been an important way to express belief in Real presence. The return of the weekly Mass, sign of the cross, eucharistic prayer and regular use of vestments in all churches are results of the liturgical movement, but things like altar servers, Gospel processions, incense, aspersions, a complete eucharistic prayer (i.e. including the epiclesis rather than merely Christ's Words of Institution) are regarded as \\"high church\\". Also genuflection, together with the elevation of the host and chalice, is often regarded among more Protestant-minded Lutherans as Roman Catholic practices, although Martin Luther himself held these practices Elevation (Christian Cyclopedia) and they were part of early Lutheranism. In Lutheran churches the use of altar bells during the elevation (to draw the attention of the congregation during the Words of Institution) was occasionally practiced until the 18th century.Yngve Brilioth: Nattvarden i evangeliskt gudstj√§nstliv, 2nd edition, 1951, p. 188 Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament during the moment of Elevation is also a Lutheran practice. The Sacrament of the Altar: The Sacrament Is Adorable And Extended In Time (by Tom G.A. Hardt) However, except in special occasions of Swedish High Church societies and among the most high-church of the North American Lutheran Churches like the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament is seldom practised, even in high church circles. Unlike in Anglican Church, use of \\"fiddleback\\" chasubles are not seen as an adherence to Roman Catholic practice, because they were traditionally used in Lutheran churches in Germany until the Enlightenment and in Nordic countries until the Liturgical movement. Today they are more rare and are not necessarily favoured by clergy in Nordic countries because of the associations with the former era of liturgical decline.

The disturbance he created greatly weakened the Jin regime, which for decades did not have any ability to fight back against rival Later Zhao. Su Jun's father Su Mo () was a prime minister of the Dukedom of Anle‚Äîthe dukedom that was given to Liu Shan the last emperor of Shu Han and his descendants. Su himself was known for his intelligence when he was young. In the aftermaths of Han Zhao's capture of Emperor Huai, Su gathered a group of refugees on modern Shandong Peninsula and served as the leader of self-protection league. This eventually brought the attention of Cao Ni () -- a general with substantial forces in modern Shandong who frequently changed his allegiance between Han Zhao and Jin, and after Cao could not persuade Su to join him, he became determined to destroy Su. Su became fearful, and in 319 he took his group of refugees south to join the Jin imperial regime under Emperor Yuan, then located at Jiankang. Emperor Yuan was impressed at how Su kept his group of refugees together and how he had come a long distance to join him, and he made Su a commandery governor. He went through a succession of posts the next few years. In 324, when the warlord Wang Dun's forces attacked Jiankang, with intent to overthrow Emperor Yuan's successor Emperor Ming, Emperor Ming summoned Su, among other generals posted on the northern border with Later Zhao, to come to his aid. When Su's forces (and those of Liu Xia ()) arrived in the capital late at night, Emperor Ming personally went to visit the forces. Su was instrumental in subsequently defeating Wang's forces, preserving Jin. After this success, Su was made the governor of Liyang Commandery (, roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui). He became proud of his success and began to have greater ambition, and he received criminals and other unwanted people into his commandery, seeking to strengthen his own personal force. After Emperor Ming's death in 325, his four-year-old son Emperor Cheng succeeded to the throne, and his maternal uncle Yu Liang became regent. Yu became apprehensive of Su and became convinced that he had to strip Su of his military post. In 327, he announced that Su was being promoted to minister of agriculture‚Äîa post that did not involve any military commands. Su refused, and asked to be transferred to another commandery instead. Yu in turn refused and prepare for war. Su then declared a rebellion against Yu's regency, stating, in a famous quote: :I would rather be on a hill and looking at the jail, rather than be in a jail and looking at the hill. In other words, he would rather lose in battle and be executed, than to submit himself to what he thought was certain imprisonment. He allied himself with Zu Yue () the governor of Yu Province (, usually referring to modern eastern Henan, but by that point mostly confined to central Anhui), and headed for Jiankang. Yu was confident he could defeat Su‚Äîso much so that he declined emergency assistance from Wen Jiao, who was then the governor of Jiang Province (, modern Jiangxi) -- but instead Su won battle after battle and reached Jiankang quickly, capturing the city and forcing Yu to flee. Su's forces pillaged the capital, stripping both officials and commoners of their wealths and even their clothing, and even the servant girls of Empress Dowager Yu, Emperor Cheng's mother, were seized. Empress Dowager Yu, in distress, died. (It is said that she was \\"humiliated\\" by Su, but the method of humiliation was not described.) Su took over the imperial government and put his allies into high positions quickly. However, Yu Liang, Wen, and Tao Kan soon entered into an alliance and headed back east to Jiankang. Eastern commanderies also rose against Su, led by Chi Jian. Despite these provincial forces having greater numbers, Su continued to defeat them in battle after battle, and even Wen and Tao, capable generals in their own right, became apprehensive. However, during one battle in late 328, Su was hit by a spear and fell off his horse, and the provincial forces quickly beheaded him. His forces tried to coalesce behind his brother Su Yi (), but collapsed in early 329.

Indian Air Force usage In the IAF, Officers of the rank of Air Commodore who command Wings, Base Repair Depots, Equipment Depots and Air Bases are styled as Air Officer Commanding (AOC). Similarly, Air Vice Marshals commanding Groups (like the J&K; Group & Maritime Air Ops Group) and Advance Headquarters are styled as Air Officer Commanding (AOC). Senior Air Marshals who command the Seven Air Commands are styled as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C). The Seven appointments are : * Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Central Air Command * Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Air Command * Air Officer Commanding-in- Chief Southern Air Command * Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief South Western Air Command * Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Air Command * Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Training Command * Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Maintenance Command United States Air Force usage In the United States Air Force, the term \\"Air Officer Commanding\\" is used specifically to refer to the specially selected officers who command cadet squadrons and groups at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally a major; in the case of a cadet group, the AOC is normally a lieutenant colonel. These officers exercise command authority over their cadet units and are expected to train cadets in officership and military matters, advise the cadets who hold leadership positions in the unit, and act as role models for the future officers. Although the vast majority of AOCs at the academy are, logically, United States Air Force officers, a small number may come from the other U.S. military branches, at least one from each of the other three branches at a given point in time. While holding these positions at the academy, these officers are still referred to as \\"Air Officers Commanding\\" despite their being Army, Navy or Marine officers who may or may not be aviators.

The show was officially announced on December 15, 2005 and ran from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays. In 2018, The Planet Mikey Podcast was created and is heard on iTunes, Stitcher, Spotify and Google Play. In February 2020, Planet Mikey debuted as an afternoon drive radio show on 100.1 FM The Pike in Worcester, MA. Mikey Adams was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in Manchester, Connecticut. Adams was a disc jockey on several stations in Hartford and Springfield, Massachusetts including WPOP, WHYN, WAQY, and WCCC where he replaced Howard Stern in 1980. Adams was Program Director at WAQY in Springfield in 1981 and was responsible for the format change from \\"Top 40\\" hits to classic rock in 1981. Adams was sports reporter and anchor for WFSB-TV Eyewitness News in Hartford from 1986 until late 1991. He hosted a live, one hour nightly TV show called \\"Mike Adams' Sports World\\" on NECN from 1992‚Äì98 and won two New England Emmy awards. He was the first sports anchor on WFXT in Boston in 1993. He began at the WEEI in 1993 while anchoring at NECN and WFXT in Boston. He lives in central Massachusetts with his wife, Christine and two sons Andrew and William. History There was an open spot on WEEI programming in the 7 p.m.-to-11 p.m.slot after the departure of Ted Sarandis. Adams had been filling in as the host for two months and had reportedly given WEEI until December 14 to make a decision regarding hiring him as a full-time replacement for Sarandis. Allegedly, programming director Jason Wolfe had not returned Adams' calls for a couple of days. Adams arrived early for his show on Wednesday, and Big Show host Glenn Ordway called Wolfe on the air with the goal of eliciting a decision on Adams future with the station. When Wolfe was finally put on the phone, he and Adams got into what sounded like a serious argument on the air that ended when Adams disconnected Wolfe. Until around 9:30 that night, Adams apparently locked himself in the studio not allowing anybody else inside except for food delivery people. Finally, Wolfe called in and gave Adams the job. WEEI reported that Wolfe received well over 1,000 emails from fans during the stunt, urging him to give Adams the job. The lock-in was later revealed to be a hoax, as reported by a Boston Globe feature on Mike Adams. The station itself also admits it was a publicity stunt orchestrated by station management.

History According to Pauline Phillips, she came up with the pen name Abigail Van Buren by combining the name of Biblical figure Abigail in the Book of Samuel, with the last name of former US president Martin Van Buren. The column was syndicated by McNaught Syndicate from 1956 until 1966, when it moved to Universal Press Syndicate. Dear Abby's current syndication company claims the column is \\"well-known for sound, compassionate advice, delivered with the straightforward style of a good friend.\\" As of 1987, over 1,200 newspapers ran the column. On June 1, 2009, the column moved from the Chicago Tribune to the Chicago Sun-Times. Abby was born Pauline Esther Friedman, and her twin sister was born Esther Pauline Friedman. Abby was known as Popo, and her sister was Eppie (a nickname from E.P.). In comparing the columns written by each of the sisters, the Jewish Women's Archive wrote that \\"Both columns were characterized by a straightforward tone, practical advice, and a firm but modern moral sensibility\\" and that \\"both women used humor, including sarcasm and one-liners, in their responses.\\" Ask Ann Landers Pauline Phillips started her Dear Abby column a few months after her twin sister, Eppie Lederer, took over the Ask Ann Landers column created by Chicago Sun-Times advice columnist Ruth Crowley in 1943. Lederer wrote the column until 2002. This produced a rivalry and lengthy estrangement between the two sisters. On February 13, 1987, the Chicago Tribune announced that the Ann Landers column was moving to the Tribune, which had published the Dear Abby column for years. The Tribune ran both columns, Landers every day and Abby six days a week. After Lederer's death, on June 22, 2002, the spirit of the column was continued by Lederer's editors, Kathy Mitchell and Marcy Sugar, under the name Annie's Mailbox; it began running on July 28, 2002, in approximately 800 newspapers. Annie's Mailbox was syndicated in numerous newspapers throughout the US until June 30, 2016. On that date, Mitchell and Sugar wrote: \\"...we say farewell. It is time for us to step aside and take advantage of opportunities neither of us has had the time for until now.\\" They also introduced columnist Annie Lane, known as Dear Annie. Change in writer Pauline Phillips wrote the column herself until 1987, at which time her daughter, Jeanne Phillips, began writing the column with her. In December 2000, the elder Phillips wrote a column identifying her daughter as her \\"co-creator\\" and added, \\"I will continue to work on this column until my Maker calls me home.\\"https://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/2000/12/11/wife-makes-chilling- discovery-of-husbands Twenty months later, the Phillips family revealed that Pauline was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2002-08-07-0208070300-story.html Although the change in authorship took place in 2000, the official statement‚Äîwhich included adding \\"Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips\\" to the bottom of each column‚Äîwas not made until July 2002.

History Westbus Volgren bodied Scania K94UB at Sydney Olympic Park in March 2013 Volgren bodied Scania K94UB at Liverpool Interchange in July 2013 Westbus's history originates from the Bosnjak family, who entered the transport business in 1955 and traded as Bosnjak's Bus Service.

Thirty years young Australian Bus issue 64 July 2014 page 51 In 1985 the coach business of Rowe's was purchased. A fleet of Volvo B10M coaches were purchased and based at Northmead. Following the purchase of Calabro's in June 1989 both fleets moved to Alexandria and later Arncliffe. The operation ceased in the early 2000s. In the United Kingdom, Westbus Australia took over Swinards Coaches, Ashford, Kent and ADP Travel Services of Hounslow to form Westbus UK in 1986. Since 2005, Westbus UK has continued to exist as a separate entity to Westbus Australia, despite using Westbus Australia's old name, logo and livery, and having the same owners. It is now owned by CityFleet Networks, also a wholly owned subsidiary of ComfortDelGro. By 1999, 57% shareholding of Westbus was held by Bosnjak Holdings, the main subsidiary of National Bus Company, which is also owned by Jim Bosnjak and his sister-in-law Carol.

Jim Bosnjak also continued to be Chairman of National Bus Company. In December 2004, Westbus' Northmead and Seven Hills operations were merged with those of the newly acquired Glenorie Bus Company under the Hillsbus brand. With debts of $90 million and National Express unwilling to provide further funding, in January 2005 the company was placed into voluntary administration. Westbus's problems threatened a major disruption to Sydney's transport network: the company ranked second only to government-owned Sydney Buses in the commuter bus industry.

He is a left-handed batsman and part-time medium pace bowler. He represented Australia in three one day internationals in 2006. Career Mark Cosgrove with Sydney Thunder in 2012. Cosgrove made his state debut in the 2002-03 season for South Australia. He was awarded the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year at the Allan Border Medal ceremony by the CA in 2005. Earlier in the 2004-05 season he had been dropped from the state side for a time for being overweight. On 28 April 2006, Cosgrove made his international debut in the third and final one day international of Australia's 2006 tour of Bangladesh. Played at the Fatullah Osmani Stadium, Fatullah, he bowled four overs for 12 runs and then opened the batting, scoring 74 before being bowled by Abdur Razzak as Australia successfully chased the Bangladesh target of 127. In September 2006, he played in Australia's first two one day internationals in the DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur, scoring 34 batting at five in a win against the West Indies before being dismissed for four while batting at six in a game against India that was rained off in the second innings. In between the two international assignments he signed for Glamorgan to play as an overseas player for the 2006 season. Cosgrove had a poor 2006‚Äì07 season with South Australia and was not selected for the 2007 World Cup, having previously been considered a possible dark horse selection. Later in 2007 he declined an offer to return to Glamorgan, instead joining the Centre of Excellence in Australia at the request of national chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch. On 25 July 2007, Cosgrove was suspended from the Centre of Excellence for disciplinary reasons. In April 2010, Cosgrove was not offered a new contract by South Australia. Jamie Cox, the state's director of cricket, said that \\"we were unable to help him fulfil his full potential.\\" He had scored 511 first-class runs in 2009-10, including two hundreds, and also averaged more than 40 in the one-day competition while also playing as South Australia progressed to the Twenty20 domestic final. He returned to Glamorgan as their overseas player for the 2010 summer season. Cosgrove joined Tasmania for the 2010-11 season and scored 806 Shield runs, the most in the competition. The following season was less successful, as he scored 347 Shield runs at 34.70 and made 203 runs at 22.25 in the Ryobi Cup. He only played one game in the inaugural Big Bash League for the Hobart Hurricanes. In 2012-13 Cosgrove scored 784 runs at 39.20 in the Sheffield Shield, the second-highest total in the competition behind Tasmanian teammate Ricky Ponting. He was less successful in limited-overs cricket, scoring just 51 runs in 4 games in the Ryobi Cup and 61 runs in 5 Big Bash League games, where he played for Sydney Thunder. In 2014, Cosgrove signed a two-year contract to return to South Australia after declining a two-year extension to his Tasmania contract. He cited a preference to return to South Australia to be closer to family. Cosgrove signed for Leicestershire in March 2015 on two- year contract, and was appointed captain. He used an English passport to play for the club so that he did not take up a place as an overseas player. As a consequence, for the 2015-16 season he took the position of South Australia's overseas player, replacing sacked captain Johan Botha in that position. He left South Australia at the end of that season, but continued played for Leicestershire until his release at the end of the Covid-19-affected 2020 season, in which he had not played a game for the club.

Mission Led by Coach Ede Warner, Louisville eschewed traditional forms of debating like speed reading, debating the resolution, and presenting traditional forms of evidence. The Louisville Project instead uses hip hop music, personal experiences, and other media to present their arguments. They argue that many elements of policy debate are exclusionary and ask the judge to cast their ballot in order to sign onto their project and in turn, increase diversity in debate. In 2005, Louisville started a \\"take it to the streets\\" initiative in which they offered to debate the topic normally if the judge was replaced with a lay person. Because of the time required to find a new critic, the rounds were to take place with reduced speech times, approximately equivalent to those of Lincoln-Douglas debate. Most teams accepted the agreement and Louisville lost the vast majority of those debates. End of the project In November 2005, Ede Warner announced, on the collegiate debate message board eDebate, his resignation as the Cross Examination Debate Association 2nd vice president, canceled the University of Louisville's debate tournament (the \\"Super Bowl of Debate\\"), and announced his plans to stop recruiting debaters and retire in 5 years. This is regarded by many in the debate community as the beginning of the end of the Louisville Project. Legacy Other colleges continued the mission of the project in various ways.

The MPOWER Movement seeks to implement policies into the debate community that will enhance multi-cultural education in collegiate debate. Louisville advocates a 10-demand plan which was distributed to the debate community during the 2006‚Äì07 season at competitions. The team uses these points to support their argument that collegiate debate is currently exclusive of minority groups based on race, economics, gender, sexuality and communicative differences.

After German reunification in 1990, the side took on its current name and appeared in the last FDGB-Pokal final in 1991, losing to league champions Hansa Rostock by a score of 1‚Äì0. This qualified for them for the following year's Cup Winner's Cup. They were eliminated in the first round, by Galatasaray. That was the high point for the club which slipped into the third tier NOFV-Oberliga Nord. The club became part of the new Regionalliga Nordost in 1994 and played at this level until the league was disbanded in 2000. Stahl then returned to the Oberliga for the next five seasons. Late in 2004, the club went bankrupt, withdrew from competition and had their results annulled. They recovered themselves sufficiently to be able to field a side in Verbandsliga Brandenburg but dropped down to the Landesliga for the 2013‚Äì14 season.

The splice joint is used when the material being joined is not available in the length required. It is an alternative to other joints such as the butt joint and the scarf joint. Splice joints are stronger than unenforced butt joints and have the potential to be stronger than a scarf joint. Splices are therefore most often used when structural elements are required in longer lengths than the available material. The most common form of the splice joint is the half lap splice, which is common in building construction, where it is used to join shorter lengths of timber into longer beams. Applications * Joining structural members end to end Types of splice joints Half Lap Splice, Bevel Lap Splice and Tabled Splice Joint There are four main types of splice joints: Half lap, Bevel lap, Tabled, and Tapered finger. =Half lap splice joint= The half lap splice joint is the simplest form of the splice joint and is commonly used to join structural members where either great strength is not required or reinforcement, such as mechanical fasteners, are to be used. The joint is cut as for a half lap. =Bevel lap splice joint= The bevel lap is a variation of the half-lap in which the cheeks of the opposing members are cut at an angle of 5 to 10 degrees, sloping back away from the end of the member, so that some resistance to tension is introduced. This helps to prevent the members from being pulled apart. =Tabled splice joint= A wedged tabled splice jointThe tabled splice joint is another variation of the half lap. The cheeks are cut with interlocking surfaces so that when brought together the joint resists being pulled apart. =Tapered finger splice joint= The tapered finger splice joint requires a series of matching 'fingers' or interlocking prominences to be cut on the ends of opposing members. The joint is brought together and glued, with the fingers providing substantial glue surface. This joint is commonly used in the production of building materials from smaller offcuts of timber. It is commonly found in skirting, architrave, and fascia. The joint is usually made by machine.

Elmhurst is known for its large elm, ash, and oak trees that provide shady canopy for the neighborhood.  Location  The boundaries of Elmhurst are defined by U.S. Highway 50 to the north, Stockton Boulevard to the west, 59th Street to the east, and V Street and Second Avenue to the south.http://www.cityofsacramento.org/ParksandRec/Neighborhood- Services/neighborhood-directory/District6/Elmhurst-Neighborhood-Association The main thoroughfare through Elmhurst is T Street. Sacramento Regional Transit routes through Elmhurst include Bus 15 and Light Rail, with stops at the 48th Street station and is within short walking distance.  History  Elmhurst was established about 1908, when H. A. McClelland purchased about southeast of Sacramento to create a residential subdivision. The neighborhood was distinguished by California Boulevard, a street running down the middle of the neighborhood with two parks serving as a median: Sunset Park to the west and Sierra Vista Park to the east. The neighborhood was added to the city in 1911 when Sacramento annexed the areas south and east of the original city grid. When the city standardized its street names in 1916, California Boulevard became an extension of T Street. In 1921, Elmhurst School was built for the neighborhood. A year later, the school was expanded and renamed \\"Coloma School\\". The school operated for 57 years before closing in 1978. The facility was saved from demolition when the Sacramento City Council decided to purchase it, and in 1981 the facility was dedicated as the Coloma Community Center. Elmhurst has largely remained the same since its creation. One notable exception is that the northern boundary was moved slightly south in the early 1970s, when U.S. Route 50 was upgraded and rerouted from Folsom Boulevard to its current path. Prior to the upgrade, the neighborhood extended northward to the Southern Pacific Railroad line.  Attractions & Characteristics  The UC Davis Medical Center is adjacent to Elmhurst; much of the medical staff take up residence in the neighborhood. The Coloma Community Center is located in Elmhurst at 4623 T Street; the community center provides recreation and preschool for local residents. Coloma Community Center is where the City of Sacramento operates its public access television station-Sacramento Public Access. The Julia Morgan House and Gardens is located three miles (5 km) west of Sac State and was designed by famous architect Julia Morgan. It was donated to the school in 1966 by Sacramento philanthropist and eugenicist Charles Goethe and was placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The school remodeled the house in 2000 honored by the California Heritage Council. Sac State uses the home hosting lectures, small meetings, conferences, community events, and it is available for public special events such as receptions and weddings. The home's west wing houses the Life Center and provides health and fitness classes for seniors.

Rochester is the largest city in the area; other major cities include Winona, Owatonna, Faribault, Northfield, Austin, and Red Wing. Southeast Minnesota is part of the state's First and Second Congressional Districts. Culturally, it is distinct from the Twin Cities in being generally more conservative and staid, with several more diverse areas, such as the college towns of Northfield and Winona. However, the area is becoming more diverse and more politically competitive. Until 2006, the state's only Independence Party legislator was from Southeast Minnesota, Sheila Kiscaden (IP-Rochester, now DFL-Rochester). Formerly a Republican, Kiscaden is now officially a member of the Minnesota Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party. The area is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota. Many places in Southeast Minnesota, like Lanesboro, are becoming popular tourist destinations.

The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the James River in central Virginia in the United States. The Rivanna's tributaries originate in the Blue Ridge Mountains; via the James River, it is part of the watershed of Chesapeake Bay. According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Rivanna has also been known as \\"Mountain Falls Creek\\" and \\"River Anna\\". Course The Rivanna River is formed in Albemarle County about northeast of Charlottesville by the confluence of two tributaries: *The North Fork Rivanna River is formed in southwestern Greene County by the confluence of the Lynch River and the Roach River, and flows southeast by south into Albemarle County. *The South Fork Rivanna River is formed in Albemarle County by the confluence of the Moormans River and the Mechums River, and flows generally eastwardly. Below this confluence, the Rivanna flows southeast through Albemarle County, skirting the eastern edge of Charlottesville and breaching the Southwest Mountains near Monticello. The Rivanna continues southeast through Fluvanna County, passing the communities of Lake Monticello and Palmyra; it enters the James River at the town of Columbia. History Monacan Indians were the inhabitants of the Rivanna valley at the time of first contact by Europeans. The locations of several sites from the period are known, and some have been explored by archaeologists. One in particular, a mound postulated to be the site of ritual burial and of spiritual significance to the tribe, is located near the confluence of the two forks of the river and was documented by Thomas Jefferson in his 1781 work Notes on the State of Virginia. Several major population centers of the tribe were located along the Rivanna, including Monasukapanough, near the headwaters of the river, and Rassawek, the principal town of the tribe, located at the confluence of the Rivanna and James rivers. In the late eighteenth century the river was made navigable, partially by the efforts of the Jeffersons who owned much of the lands along its upper course, including Shadwell where Peter Jefferson had built a small mill complex on the river, overlooked by a lofty hill now known as Monticello. Improvements included in the first generation (through approximately 1830) were sluice cuts, small dams, and batteaux locks. Second generation (approx. 1840-1870) improvements had long stretches of canal, serviced by large locks, many of which are still visible along the river today. Shortly after the completion of the initial Rivanna navigational works, Virginia requested that the river be opened to public usage. It is said Jefferson at first refused, but the commonwealth would not be denied, and the Rivanna became an integral part of the central Virginian transportation network. Swimmers in the Rivanna, near Free Union The route served a large community of farmsteads and plantations throughout Albemarle and Fluvanna counties. It also bore ever-growing numbers of industrial facilities, like those at Union Mills and the Charlottesville Woolen Mills. It was the construction of these larger mills which prompted the great \\"second generation\\" improvements to navigation which were coordinated by the Rivanna Navigation Company. Union Mills alone featured a canal and towpath, one upper and two massive lower locks, all directly upon the river. Where the Rivanna meets the James River at Columbia so too did the Rivanna Connexion canal merge with the James River and Kanawha Canal, itself an altogether impressive work intended to connect Richmond with the Ohio River and the West. The series of locks which connected the two works lie just outside the town, and are mostly buried by sediment today. In the batteaux era Milton was the head of navigation along the river, but by the mid-nineteenth century horse-drawn canal boats were traveling all the way upstream to Charlottesville, where the head of navigation was located at the very point where the Fredericksburg Road (now VA 20) and Three Chopt Road (U.S. Route 250), the primary road to Richmond (before the construction of Interstate 64), meet and enter the city over the Free Bridge, establishing the city as a major commercial hub. During the late twentieth century the river saw the establishment of the Rivanna Trail, a greenbelt trail that encircles the city of Charlottesville. As its name suggests the trail was originally envisioned as a river-front promenade, after the San Antonio River Walk, but the plan was soon enlarged under the guidance of the Rivanna Trails Foundation. It now takes hikers all the way around Charlottesville, passing through many of the city's parks and the wooded lands surrounding it, totaling over in length. Management and conservation The Rivanna River is the focus of considerable conservation efforts. In the early 1990s a group of concerned citizens (Roger Black, David Carter, Chet Maxxie and Steve Pence) joined together to create the Rivanna Conservation Society, (RCS) a nonprofit with the mission of preserving the Rivanna‚Äôs scenic, cultural, historic and ecological attributes. In the late 1990s the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission convened an EPA-funded multi-stakeholder conservation planning effort, and in 1998 this Rivanna River Roundtable published its State of the Basin report identifying key management and conservation needs. In 2001, The Nature Conservancy, noting its many endemic and rare species including the endangered James River spinymussel, identified the Rivanna basin as ‚Äúone of the finest remaining freshwater river and stream systems in the Piedmont.‚Äù In 2002 a local scientist, John Murphy, founded a community-based monitoring program named StreamWatch. The StreamWatch benthic water quality monitoring program created a watershed-wide intensive data collection at permanent stream monitoring sites throughout the Rivanna and its tributaries. Note: In 2016 the Rivanna Conservation Society and StreamWatch merged into a single nonprofit: The Rivanna Conservation Alliance (RCA). In 2006 The Nature Conservancy raised funds and approached local governments to successfully facilitate the establishment of the Rivanna River Basin Commission, a multi-jurisdictional body composed of local elected officials, Soil and Water Conservation District representatives, and citizens. In 2008 the Rivanna River Basin Commission Technical Advisory Committee identified altered hydrology and sediment pollution as principal threats to the health of the system. (In general, altered hydrology refers changes in flow regime due to impervious land cover, withdrawals, and dams. The Technical Committee‚Äôs findings regarding the Rivanna were limited to land-cover mediated hydrological alteration). The Rivanna is a source of drinking water to the Charlottesville area and Lake Monticello. Water supply management and planning have been somewhat controversial. In 2006 a plan to expand water supply by piping water from South Fork Rivanna Reservoir to an enlarged Ragged Mountain Reservoir gained wide endorsement from environmental organizations, the water authority, and permitting agencies. Subsequently, however, some citizens have criticized the plan on the basis of cost, and have encouraged further research about dredging the South Fork Rivanna Reservoir. In most respects, Rivanna management and conservation efforts have been marked by significant cooperation among diverse stakeholders. The Rivanna River Basin Commission and the community monitoring program (StreamWatch) feature substantial participation by citizens, the conservation community (e.g. Rivanna Conservation Alliance), local governments (Albemarle County, Fluvanna County, Greene County, and the City of Charlottesville), resource management agencies (Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District) and quasi-governmental organizations (Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority, Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission).

It is three miles west of Flagler Beach on CR 2001, south of SR 100, and contains the ruins of an ante-bellum plantation and its sugar mill, built of coquina, a fossiliferous sedimentary rock composed of shells. It was the largest plantation in East Florida, and was operated with the forced labor of enslaved Africans and African Americans. History The plantation was developed beginning in 1821 by Major Charles Wilhelm Bulow, who acquired 4,675 acres on a tidal creek (later Bulow Creek). He had 2,200 acres cleared by the labor of his enslaved workforce for the cultivation of commodity crops: indigo, cotton, rice, and sugarcane. At his death in 1823, his seventeen-year-old son, John Joachim Bulow inherited the property and managed it. At Christmas 1831 into January 1832, Bulow hosted the artist and naturalist John James Audubon, who explored the area in his continuing study of American birds. About that time, Bulow had a sugar mill constructed on his property. The plantation was destroyed in the Seminole War of 1836. The property and ruins were acquired by the State of Florida in 1945 and dedicated as a State Historic Park in 1957. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 29 September 1970. Fauna Among the wildlife of the park are bald eagles, swallow-tailed kites, and Florida manatees. Recreational activities Activities include hiking, fishing, wildlife viewing, canoeing and kayaking, and picnicking. Amenities include a 6.8 mile hiking trail, a boat ramp, and a screened picnic pavilion. Bulow Creek is recognized as a State Canoe Trail. The park's interpretive center features original artifacts and exhibits about the Bulow Plantation. Hours The park is open between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM Thursday through Monday. Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

The house  The house is located at 56 Parnassus Lane (formerly 2188 Stoll Road). The house was built by Ottmar Gramms, who bought the land in 1952. The house was newly built when Rick Danko, then part of Bob Dylan's backing band, found it as a rental in 1967, after the cancellation of Dylan's tour due to his 1966 motorcycle crash. Dylan was living at the time in nearby Woodstock. Danko moved into the house along with bandmates Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel in February 1967. The house became known locally as \\"Big Pink\\" for its pink siding.  The Basement Tapes  In early 1967, Bob Dylan and the musicians who would later become The Band began to record together, initially in the \\"Red Room\\" at Dylan's house, Hi Lo Ha, in the Byrdcliffe area of Woodstock. In June, these sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink, where Hudson set up a recording space using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Dylan's manager Albert Grossman, as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. During June-October 1967, Dylan and The Band recorded a huge number of cover songs and original Dylan material in the basement. In the process, The Band began to develop their distinctive sound for the first time. These sessions ended in October 1967, with Levon Helm having rejoined the group by that time. The recordings were not commercially released at the time, but attracted attention through a demo circulated amongst recording artists by Dylan's publishing company Dwarf Music, and through bootlegs such as Great White Wonder.Griffin, Sid (2007).

Music from Big Pink  After the conclusion of the sessions with Dylan, The Band began writing their own songs at Big Pink. They still had no official name, and in 1969, Rolling Stone referred to them as \\"the band from Big Pink.\\" These songs became their first album, Music from Big Pink (1968). The album included three songs written or co-written by Dylan (\\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", \\"Tears of Rage\\", and \\"I Shall Be Released\\") as well as \\"The Weight\\", the use of which in the film Easy Rider would make it probably their best-known song. The album features a photograph of Big Pink on its back cover, along with a description written by Canadian journalist Dominique Bourgeois, who went on to marry Robertson.  Later legacy  The house was subsequently sold by Gramms in 1977. It was rented to classical music label Parnassus Records, which used it as its headquarters, before becoming a private residence in 1998. As of 2017, the house is used as a vacation rental property, with publicity featuring its role in music history. A painting of Big Pink was used as the cover of The Band's 1993 album Jericho.

He appeared in several Western films in the 1930s, including the role of Zorro in Zorro Rides Again in 1937. He was the male lead in the Marx Brothers' Western comedy Go West in 1940. Probably his best known role was as Woody Jason in the 1942 movie Flying Tigers with John Wayne. He was also notable as a Cajun soldier, aptly nicknamed Wolf, in the 1945 comedy A Letter for Evie. He interrupted his movie career during World War II and served as a U.S. Army Air Corps pilot in North Africa. He broke his back in a crash. He recovered and resumed his acting career. John Carroll was a well-established actor and his wife Lucille was a casting director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). In 1948, the famous movie actress Marilyn Monroe moved into their house. They helped support her emotionally and financially during her difficult transition period. Their support was essential in her success as an actress. Carroll worked steadily through the mid-1950s, but his career began to fade in the latter half of the decade. He did play a memorable role in the 1957 Budd Boetticher western Decision at Sundown as Tate Kimbrough, the evil nemesis of Randolph Scott's character. His last roles were in Ride in a Pink Car in 1974 and in Orson Welles' The Other Side of the Wind, released in 2018, that he joined in 1975.

Coins were invented several times independently of each other. The earliest coins from the Mediterranean region are from the kingdom of Lydia, and are now dated ca. 600 BCE. The dating of the earliest coins of China and India is difficult and the subject of debate. Nevertheless, the first coins of China are at least as old as the earliest Lydian coins and possibly older, while the earliest coins of India seems to have appeared at a later stage. Pre-modern Chinese coins were always cast bronze or brass issues. This concept was later adopted by Japan, Korea and Annam (Vietnam), and also influenced regions in South-East Asia. The Lydian coins consisted of discs or lumps of electrum (a natural gold/silver alloy), and were stamped on two sides with dies. This concept spread rapidly to neighbouring Greek city states in Asia Minor and across the Aegean Sea, and eventually throughout the Mediterranean. When Lydia was conquered by Achaemenid Persia, the production of Lydian coins continued in the guise of silver Siglos and gold Darics. Other parts of Persia only began to mint coins at the time of Alexander the Great's conquest. Coinage of India began in the 7th century BCE, as small native states known as the Mahajanapadas began to mint coins of silver. The concept of coinage, and many design elements, spread across the Indian subcontinent within centuries. India subsequently absorbed and modified numerous influences, including Greek, Roman, Arabic and Persian. Coinage of East Asia =China= Zhou and Xin dynasties, and some others. Some appear to be forgeries. A Chinese coin of the Ming Dynasty, inscribed Ê∞∏Ê®ÇÈÄöÂØ∂ (Yong Le tong bao) or Yong Le currency. Yong Le was the regnal name of Emperor Zhu Di (1402‚Äì24). Some time around the 7th century BCE, coins shaped like utensils emerged in China. In most regions, spade-shaped coins were issued, while knife-shaped coins were issued in the North-East. In the state of Chu (in Southern China), small oval bronze pieces were issued. Numismatists and archaeologists believe that the minting of coins was not organized by the central authority, i.e. the royal court of Zhou. The spade and knife coins underwent a number of changes in size, shape and inscriptions. Cowrie shells are found in archaeological excavations that date back to the Shang era (2nd millennium BCE). These might have been used as currency, but there is not agreement as to whether they did serve a currency purpose or not. Various other bronze artifacts have been described as money (e.g. \\"bridge money\\"); these are now believed to be various types of ornaments, not related to currency. During the 4th century BCE, a new type of coins, the \\"ban liang\\" type, was introduced in the Western state of Qin. The ban liang coins were round, cast bronze coins with a hole in the center, inscribed \\"ban liang\\", or half liang (a weight unit). Qin eventually conquered the other states of China and replaced the defunct Zhou Dynasty with the Qin Dynasty in 221 BCE. The monetary systems of China were now standardized, based on the Qin model, and knife and spade coins were replaced with ban liang coins. The round, cast base metal coins of the Far East are known as cash coins. The cash coins were customarily strung together with hempen threads into standard-size strings of cash, representing a fixed value. In 118 BCE, the ban liang coins were replaced by another type, the \\"wu zhu\\" type, that was inscribed \\"wu zhu\\", or five zhu (another weight unit). These were minted until 621 CE, shortly after the establishment of the Tang Dynasty. Being minted for almost a thousand years combined, the ban liang and wu zhu coins come in a great number of varieties. The uncovering of the history of these varieties is an ongoing process. The coins issued during the Tang Dynasty were unusual in their day, in the sense that the obverse inscription consisted of four characters instead of two. The \\"Kai Yuan tong bao\\" coins were minted throughout the Tang era, and subsequent Chinese coin issues (up to around 1900) were based on this precedent. During the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, the first two (out of four) characters of the obverse inscription represented the name of the current regnal era, thereby indicating the emperor under which the individual coin was minted. A system of discrete calligraphical variation was employed, thereby facilitating identification of the mint that was responsible for minting any given coin. During the Song and Ming dynasties, the reverse was often blank, although some carry the regnal year of the emperor or some other inscription. During the Qing Dynasty, the reverse explicitly indicated the mint, initially in Chinese, but later in Manchu. Unlike the Song and Ming dynasties, Qing Dynasty coins come in one denomination only until the mid 19th century. During the Taiping Rebellion, inflated large size coins (e.g. coins representing 50 or 100 cash/units) were minted. During the colonial era, foreign silver coins entered China 1. Traditionally, China did not have a silver coinage, although silver was stored in the shape of silver bars (so-called sycees). As the Chinese harbours were forcibly opened for foreign trade by the colonial powers, foreign silver coins poured into China, and profoundly altered the monetary system and modes of economic transaction. The production of traditional cash coins ceased, and various provinces began, during the 1880s, to acquire modern equipment, capable of minting modern Western style coinage, akin to the coinage that was being introduced through foreign trade. This put the traditional cash coinage to rest, while the modern coinage of China began. =Japan= Japanese coins of the 17th to 19th centuries Coinage in Japan initially consisted of Chinese coins that arrived in Japan through trade. It is not clear when the influx of Chinese coins began. In the late 7th century CE, domestically minted coins commenced. Such domestically minted coins, modelled on the Tang Dynasty precedent, continued to be emitted until 958. These coins were minted in comparatively small numbers and amounted only to a supplement, not an alternative, to the imported coins. For centuries to come, there was no domestic Japanese coinage, except some interimistically manufactured reproductions of pre-existing coin types. Cash coins were known as \\"mon\\" in Japanese. Only with the unification of Japan achieved by Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu (late 16th, early 17th centuries), a proud domestic coinage was revived. Base metal coins were modelled on the Chinese cash type, while various types of standardized silver and gold bars served as precious metal currency. Such coins continued to be minted until the 1860s, when the Shogunate was abolished and a series of modernizing reforms began, including modernization of Japanese currency. =Korea= Issues based on the Chinese cash were issued from 1888‚Äì1892 of 1 hwan = 1000 mun or cash. Replaced in 1892 with 1 hwan = 5 yang. =Tibet= Tibetan coins were struck in Lhasa and in the Kong-po province between 1763 and 1954. Since 1959 Chinese currency replaces that of Tibet. Coinage of South Asia =India= A punch-marked coin from the Nanda Empire. A silver drachm of king Antialkidas (c. 145‚Äì135 B.C.), an Indo-Greek ruler in the Indus region. The first Indian coins were either round, square or long sticks of silver with punch marks issued under various kingdoms starting from around 600 BCE onwards. Issuers included Kashi, Kosala, the Magadha Empire, Kuru, Panchala, Taxila, Gandhara, Kamboja, Avanti in the Narbada Valley, Saurashtra Peninsula, and the Eastern Deccan. The first coins issued by a unified Indian empire was from the Maurya Empire, though they were similar to the older issues. During the 4th century BC, after Alexander the Great's conquest of the Indus Valley and Punjab region, the Greek currency Drachma was introduced and was carried on by Bactria, Indo-Scythians and Kushans. All these were of the Attica weight standard. Coinage of Southeast Asia =Funan, Dvaravat and Khmer Empires= Not much is known of the currency of the Funan, Dvaravati, Chenla or Kambuja in Cambodia and the Khmer Empire from 100‚Äì1370 CE. The origin of the coins were based on ancient Indian coinage that has been more stylised over the millennia. Funan and Dvaravat coins were silver and bronze or brass. Khmer coins were made of lead and came in 3 weights, 1unit, 3unit and 6unit, a 10unit coin may exist but is debatable. There is not much variation to these coins when compared to Indian coinage, Roman coinage or Greek coins. =Annam= pope coins were based on the Chinese cash coinage, mostly imitations at first then issued with Chinese characters but in Vietnamese. =Indonesia/Malaysia region= These coins were mainly issued by the Chinese diaspora and Islamic sultanates all over the Indonesian archipelago who minted coins based mainly on the Chinese cash coinage.

Flippen), Grant McLaine (Stewart) rescues a young boy, Joey Adams (Brandon deWilde), from Concho (Robert J. Wilke). Ben informs Grant that his payroll has been robbed three times already by a gang led by Whitey Harbin (Dan Duryea) and the Utica Kid (Murphy). If Ben's workers don't get paid soon, they will all leave the end-of-track work camp. Grant accepts the undercover job of carrying $10,000 to the crew by train. When the train is held up again, Grant hides the money in a shoebox carried by Joey. The ploy works, but the young boy turns out to be friends with the Utica Kid, who takes him along with him. When the robbers cannot find the money, Whitey takes Ben's wife Verna (Elaine Stewart) to hold for ransom. Concho, a gang member, pistol-whips Grant, tumbling him down the steep embankment unconscious. The train leaves without him. When Grant wakes up, he trails the gang to an abandoned mining camp. He boldly asks to join up, revealing that he is the Kid's older brother [the Kid's given name is Lee]. Utica is suspicious of his heretofore honest sibling, so Whitey (who dislikes the Kid) accepts him. Concho tries to shoot Grant unexpectedly, but Grant is faster to the draw. Afterwards, he tells the Kid where the money is, in an attempt to reform his brother. It doesn't work. The Kid gives Grant ten minutes to leave before he tells the gang, but Grant calls his bluff. Then, railroad employee Will Renner (Herbert Anderson) shows up to collect his share of the loot. He had been Whitey's informant. He recognizes Grant (by the song he sings and plays on his accordion) as the man assigned to deliver the payroll. A gunfight ensues, in and out of the barroom. Grant and Verna take refuge behind the bar temporarily, as the building is on fire. They manage to drop through the rotten floor behind the bar and escape. In the stable, they join Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Drew (Dianne Foster), the Kid's girlfriend, and ride out after Lee and Joey. At the ore mill, Grant sends Verna to safety down the mountain in an ore bucket. Charlie refuses to leave. Meanwhile, the Kid is planning to quietly leave with Joey and the money. However, Joey rushes to Grant's side, and the Kid reluctantly joins forces with his brother. They kill all the gang members except Whitey. When Whitey crawls up close and shoots at Grant, the Kid steps in, taking the bullet. Grant then kills Whitey. Grant buries his brother before they ride to the camp. With Grant's urging, Joey gets to work on his \\"promised\\" job, hauling water. Grant decides that his old job of railroad troubleshooter is a \\"better fit\\" than the offered position of being next in charge. The final scene is of the locomotive moving down the valley along the river into the foreground, with the theme song \\"Follow the River\\" softly playing.  Cast  Production background This film is reminiscent of the popular western collaborations between Stewart and director Anthony Mann. This is largely because the project was slated to be their sixth collaboration. Mann backed out of the project before production due to other obligations and a disagreement over the casting of Audie Murphy. Aaron Rosenberg, who produced many of the Stewart-Mann collaborations, stayed on as producer with new director James Neilson.Paul Tatara, 'Night Passage', Turner Classic Movies accessed 4 June 2012 Dimitri Tiomkin scored the film, and co-wrote the songs \\"Follow the River\\" and \\"You Can't Get Far Without a Railroad\\" with Ned Washington, which were performed by James Stewart himself. The film also offered Stewart the rare opportunity to play the accordion, an instrument he had played since childhood. However, his accordion playing was rerecorded by a professional during post-production. The film was the first American production to utilize the Technirama process by Technicolor. This process helped make the blue skies crisper and brighten the autumn footage photographed by cinematographer William H. Daniels. The railroad scenes were filmed at the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Durango, Colorado, using Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad K-28 Class steam locomotive #476 which still operates in excursion service there today.Railroad Movies on DVD Considerable footage from the railroad scenes was recycled into the 1966 Audie Murphy film Gunpoint. Though not as memorable as the Stewart-Mann films, Night Passage was a commercial success upon its release and has become a staple of cable television. Co-star Dianne Foster got a closeup look at Audie Murphy's legendary temper when filming a scene in which his horse would not cooperate and several takes were needed. Murphy was riding his own horse, a quarter-horse named Flying John. Murphy got so angry with the animal that he drew back and punched the horse in the face. This film is one of the few which cast Audie Murphy as villainous.

The album received positive reviews from critics.  Recording and release  And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out was recorded at Alex the Great in Nashville, Tennessee and mixed at the Big House in Manhattan, New York City. The album was produced by Roger Moutenot and released on February 22, 2000 by Matador Records. The title of the album is likely derived from a Sun Ra quote: \\"...At first there was nothing...then nothing turned itself inside-out and became something\\". The album artwork is made up of photographs by surrealist photographer and Yale professor Gregory Crewdson. The album reached #138 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the U.S., their first to do so. As of January 2003, the album has sold 114,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan.  Music and lyrics  And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out marks a creative shift in Yo La Tengo's songwriting with a greatly slower approach. The band continued to expand on their simplistic songwriting. Many songs on the album are soft ballads with very airy percussion and background noises. However, the guitars and bass provide a strong undertone of reverberation. The album also features an array of backing instruments such as vibraphone and drum machines, which all lend an expansion of musical textures and differentiation of timbre. Yo La Tengo deliver more subdued art-pop songs on this album than on any other. However, their noise rock influence is also most present in songs like \\"Saturday\\", \\"Cherry Chapstick\\", \\"Tired Hippo\\", and the 17-minute epic \\"Night Falls on Hoboken\\". The title \\"Let's Save Tony Orlando's House\\" comes from an episode of The Simpsons, titled \\"Marge on the Lam\\". It is the name of a telethon that actor Troy McClure previously hosted. During this period, many of their tracks were given temp-titles based on Troy McClure's filmography. The song \\"The Crying of Lot G\\" is a reference to Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49. \\"You Can Have It All\\" is a cover of the George McCrae song, originally written by Harry Wayne Casey of KC and the Sunshine Band. Yo La Tengo's take is of a distinctly different style, with a much slower tempo. A techno version of \\"You Can Have It All\\" was used as Northwest Airlines's theme song under the Now You're Flying Smart slogan. The track \\"Our Way to Fall\\" appears in an episode of Six Feet Under titled \\"Driving Mr. Mossback\\" (season 2, episode 4).  Critical reception  And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares felt that the album \\"isn't as immediate as some of the group's earlier work, but it's just as enduring, proving that Yo La Tengo is the perfect band to grow old with\\". The album appeared at number 8 in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2000. In 2009, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 37 on its list of The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s. Similarly, the album was ranked at number 77 in Rolling Stones list of 100 Best Albums of the 2000s. In 2014, the album was ranked at number 44 in PopMatters list of the 100 Best Albums of the 2000s. In 2018, Pitchfork ranked it fifth on its list of The 30 Best Dream Pop Albums. In 2019, the album was ranked 82nd on The Guardian's 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list.

At the fall of Habsburg monarchy he remained in Austria and recognized the new republic in order to marry Dagmar, Baroness von Nicolics-Podrinska. The couple had one daughter. After divorcing his wife in 1931, Leopold eventually emigrated to the United States where he became a naturalized American citizen under the name Leopold Lorraine, and where he remarried. He died in 1958 in Connecticut. Life Archduke Leopold of Austria was born in Agram (the historic Austrian-German name for what is now the city of Zagreb in Croatia), the fifth child and second son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria, Prince of Tuscany and Infanta Blanca of Spain (daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid). He received the names Leopold Maria Alfons Blanka Karl Anton Beatrix Michael Joseph Peter Ignatz von Habsburg-Lothringen. During World War I Archduke Leopold served as a lieutenant of artillery in the Austro-Hungarian Army with his eldest brother Archduke Rainier. His actions as an officer at the Battle of Medeazza, near Trieste in Italy, (25 May 1917) were favorably noted. At the age of 19, he was the last person appointed to the Order of the Golden Fleece by his great uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Archduke Leopold also took part in the first line of combat in the Battle of the Piave River. After the fall of the Habsburg Monarchy and the establishment of the First Austrian Republic, he renounced his rights to the Austrian throne in order that he could remain in Austria. He was in love with Baroness Dagmar Nicolics- Podrinska (Zagreb 15 July 1898 - Lausanne 15 November 1967), a member of the minor Croatian nobility.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 51 His parents were initially against the marriage as Dagmar did not belong to a royal family. The wedding took place in Vienna on 12 April 1919. Theirs was a morganatic marriage. Dagmar received the title of Baroness von Wolfenau. The couple had one daughter : *Gabrielle of Habsburg-Lorraine (Vienna 15 May 1921 ‚Äì Z√ºrich 1996) (created Countess of Wolfenau in 1922), who married Jan van der M√ºhll (1918 - 1977), a Swiss banker, in 1948 and had two daughters and a son in Switzerland before her divorce in 1958. Through his mother, after the death in 1931 of his uncle Jaime, Duke of Madrid, Leopold was an heir to the Carlist claims to the throne of Spain, but having given up his aristocratic status upon his morganatic marriage in 1919, he renounced the claims in favour his youngest brother, Archduke Karl Pius of Austria (b. Vienna 4 December 1909 - d. Barcelona 24 December 1953), but took them up again after his brother's death. Through his grandmother Princess Maria Immaculata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies he was in the line of succession to the British Throne, ranking around 300th in line at his birth, and descending to approximately 1000th in line at the time of his death. In 1930 Archduke Leopold was cleared of a grand larceny charge in connection with the sale of a necklace that had been in the possession of the sister-in-law of the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal. The necklace, valued at $400,000, had been a gift to an earlier Habsburg, Marie Louise, from her husband Napol√©on Bonaparte. After divorcing his wife in 1931, Leopold emigrated to the United States where he was known as \\"Mr. Leopold H(absburg) Lorraine\\". In 1932 he remarried, also morganatically, Alicia Gibson Coburn (New York 20 January 1898 - New York City 25 August 1960). Their marriage remained childless and ended in divorce. For a time Leopold sought a career in Hollywood and had several minor roles. He moved to Willimantic, Connecticut where he settled into a small house with his second wife and spent the rest of his life as a factory worker. He became an American citizen in 1953. His ashes are in tomb 91 of the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. Ancestry References *Harding, Bertita. Lost Waltz: A Story of Exile. Bobbs-Merrill, 1944. ASIN: B0007DXCLY *McIntosh, David.

Mach numbers up to 4 in air are easily obtained without any additional heating of the flow. With heating, Mach numbers of up to 11 can be reached. Principle A Ludwieg tube is a wind tunnel that produces supersonic flow for short periods of time. A large evacuated dump tank is separated from the downstream end of a convergent- divergent nozzle by a diaphragm or fast acting valve. The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a shock wave propagates into the low-pressure region (here the dump tank) and an expansion wave propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady subsonic flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the convergent-divergent nozzle to a supersonic condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from the far end of the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes.Experiments on the Mechanism of Inducing Transition between Regular and Mach Reflection For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between expansion wave reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.Facilities and Instrumentation for Hypersonic Measurements of Transition Mechanisms at Purdue University History The Ludwieg tube was invented by Hubert Ludwieg (1912-2000) in 1955 in response to a competition for a transonic or supersonic wind tunnel design that would be capable of producing high Reynolds number at low operating cost. Professor Ludwieg was also responsible for the experimental demonstration and explanation of the large effect of sweep on the drag of transonic wings (his dissertation in 1937).

It neighbours the Barossa Valley wine region. At the 2016 census, Freeling had a population of 2,214. Description Freeling is in the Light Regional Council, the state electoral district of Schubert and the federal Division of Barker.  History  The township of Freeling was surveyed in March 1860 by Robert Stephenson. It was named after Major-General Sir Arthur Henry Freeling, Surveyor-General of South Australia from 1849-61.Biography of Arthur Freeling in Australian Dictionary of Biography online, accessed 5 October 2007. Freeling was a stopping place on the Gawler to Kapunda railway, which opened in 1860 but is no longer used. The Freeling Hotel was founded in 1863, the Railway Hotel in 1867 and the St Petri Lutheran Church (now a private home) in 1871. By 1866, Freeling‚Äôs population numbered approximately 60. Local economy The main source of income for the town is its extensive farming land, where mainly cereal crops are grown. It is regarded as some of the best farming land in Australia, with the University of Adelaide's Roseworthy Campus, (Roseworthy, South Australia) situated nearby. The long-term rainfall average for Freeling is 475mm/Yr, this enables wheat crops of up to 5-6T/Ha to be grown as well as large tonnages of cereal hay, with thousands of acres of hay being harvested each year. A factory making farming implement blades and parts, has also been situated at Freeling for many years. A major tourist attraction for the town and surrounding area is a popular Australian Drama television series, McLeod's Daughters. The town had many sets used on the show, including the Gungellan Hotel (previously the Railway Hotel), truckstop and showgrounds.

The liquid thermal diffusion process was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by Philip H. Abelson and other scientists at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. This was primarily due to doubts about the process's technical feasibility, but inter-service rivalry between the United States Army and United States Navy also played a part. Pilot plants were built at the Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a production facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week. The S-50 plant ceased production in September 1945, but it was reopened in May 1946, and used by the United States Army Air Forces Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project. The plant was demolished in the late 1940s.  Background  The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission in uranium by the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch soon after, opened up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction with uranium. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop nuclear weapons, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler applied the liquid drop model of the atomic nucleus to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies was due to the uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. The former makes up 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of uranium-234, 0.006 percent. At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists‚ÄîFrisch and Rudolf Peierls‚Äîthe task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within an order of magnitude of 10 kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.  Liquid thermal diffusion  alt=A sereies of concentric tubes. In the middle is steam, surrounded by nickel pipe, uranium hexafluoride, copper pipe, water and iron pipe The liquid thermal diffusion process was based on the discovery by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is known as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman‚ÄìEnskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F. W. Dootson in 1916. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938, who used it to separate isotopes of neon. They used an apparatus called a \\"column\\", consisting of a vertical tube with a hot wire down the center. In the United States, Arthur Bramley at the United States Department of Agriculture improved on this design by using concentric tubes with different temperatures.  Research and development  Philip H. Abelson was a young physicist who had been awarded his PhD from the University of California on 8 May 1939. He was among the first American scientists to verify nuclear fission, reporting his results in an article submitted to the Physical Review in February 1939, and collaborated with Edwin McMillan on the discovery of neptunium. Returning to the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where he had a position, he became interested in isotope separation. In July 1940, Ross Gunn from the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) showed him a 1939 paper on the subject by Harold Urey, and Abelson became intrigued by the possibility of using the liquid thermal diffusion process. He began experiments with the process at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution. Using potassium chloride (KCl), potassium bromide (KBr), potassium sulfate () and potassium dichromate (), he was able to achieve a separation factor of 1.2 (20 percent) of the potassium-39 and potassium-41 isotopes. The next step was to repeat the experiments with uranium. He studied the process with aqueous solutions of uranium salts, but found that they tended to be hydrolyzed in the column. Only uranium hexafluoride () seemed suitable. In September 1940, Abelson approached Ross Gunn and Lyman J. Briggs, the director of the National Bureau of Standards, who were both members of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) Uranium Committee. The NRL agreed to make $2,500 available to the Carnegie Institution to allow Abelson to continue his work, and in October 1940, Briggs arranged for it to be moved to the Bureau of Standards, where there were better facilities. Uranium hexafluoride was not readily available, so Abelson devised his own method of producing it in quantity at the NRL, through fluoridation of the more easily produced uranium tetrafluoride at . Initially, this small plant supplied uranium hexafluoride for the research at Columbia University, the University of Virginia and the NRL. In 1941, Gunn and Abelson placed an order for uranium hexafluoride with the Harshaw Chemical Company in Cleveland, Ohio, using Abelson's process. In early 1942, the NDRC awarded Harshaw a contract to build a pilot plant to produce of uranium hexafluoride per day. By the spring of 1942, Harshaw's pilot uranium hexafluoride plant was operational, and DuPont also began experiments with using the process. Demand for uranium hexafluoride soon rose sharply, and Harshaw and DuPont increased production to meet it. Abelson erected eleven columns at the Bureau of Standards, all approximately in diameter, but ranging from high. Test runs were carried out with potassium salts, and then, in April 1941, with uranium hexafluoride. On 1 June 1941, Abelson became an employee of the NRL, and he moved to the Anacostia Naval Air Station. In September 1941, he was joined by John I. Hoover, who became his deputy. They constructed an experimental plant there with columns. Steam was provided by a gas-fired boiler. They were able to separate isotopes of chlorine, but the apparatus was ruined in November by the decomposition products of the carbon tetrachloride. The next run indicated 2.5% separation, and it was found that the optimal spacing of the columns was between . Abelson regarded a run on 22 June with a 9.6% result as the first successful test of liquid thermal diffusion with uranium hexafluoride. In July, he was able to achieve 21%.  Relations with the Manhattan Project  The NRL authorized a pilot plant in July 1942, which commenced operation on 15 November. This time they used fourteen columns, with a separation of between them. The pilot plant ran without interruption from 3 to 17 December 1942. Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who had been designated to take charge of what would become known as the Manhattan Project (but would not do so for another two days), visited the pilot plant with the Deputy District Engineer of the Manhattan District, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols on 21 September, and spoke with Gunn and Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr., the director the NRL. Groves left with the impression that the project was not being pursued with sufficient urgency. The project was expanded, and Nathan Rosen joined the project as a theoretical physicist. Groves visited the pilot plant again on 10 December 1942, this time with Warren K. Lewis, a professor of chemical engineering from MIT, and three DuPont employees. In his report Lewis recommended that the work be continued. Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr., at his desk at the Navy Department, Washington, D.C., during the World War II years. The S-1 Executive Committee superseded the Uranium Committee on 19 June 1942, dropping Gunn from its membership in the process. It considered Lewis' report, and passed on its recommendation to Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), of which the S-1 Executive Committee was a part. The relationship between the OSRD and the NRL was not good; Bowen criticised it for diverting funds from the NRL. Bush was mindful of a 17 March 1942 directive from the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, albeit on his advice, that the navy was to be excluded from the Manhattan Project. He preferred to work with the more congenial Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, over whom he had more influence. James B. Conant, the chairman of the NDRC and the S-1 Executive Committee, was concerned that the navy was running its own nuclear project, but Bush felt that it did no harm. He met with Gunn at Anacostia on 14 January 1943, and explained the situation to him. Gunn responded that the navy was interested in nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines. Liquid thermal diffusion was a viable means of producing enriched uranium, and all he needed was details about nuclear reactor design, which he knew was being pursued by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. He was unaware that it had already built Chicago Pile-1, a working nuclear reactor. Bush was unwilling to provide the requested data, but arranged with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, a fellow member of the Military Policy Committee that ran the Manhattan Project, for Abelson's efforts to receive additional support. The following week, Briggs, Urey, and Eger V. Murphree from the S-1 Executive Committee, along with Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from Standard Oil, visited the pilot plant at Anacostia. They were impressed with the simplicity of the process, but disappointed that no enriched uranium product had been withdrawn from the plant; production had been calculated by measuring the difference in concentration. They calculated that a liquid thermal diffusion plant capable of producing 1 kg per day of uranium enriched to 90% uranium-235 would require 21,800 columns, each with a separation factor of 30.7%. It would take 18 months to build, assuming the use of the Manhattan Project's overriding priority for materials. This included of scarce copper for the outer tubes and nickel for the inner, which would be required to resist corrosion by the steam and uranium hexafluoride respectively. The estimated cost of such a plant was around $32.6 million to build and $62,600 per day to run. What killed the proposal was that the plant would require 600 days to reach equilibrium, by which time $72 million would have been spent, which the S-1 Executive Committee rounded up to $75 million. Assuming that work started immediately, and the plant worked as designed, no enriched uranium could be produced before 1946. Murphree suggested that a liquid thermal diffusion plant producing uranium enriched to 10% uranium-235 might be a substitute for the lower stages of a gaseous diffusion plant, but the S-1 Executive Committee decided against this. Between February and July 1943 the Anacostia pilot plant produced of slightly enriched uranium hexafluoride, which was shipped to the Metallurgical Laboratory. In September 1943, the S-1 Executive Committee decided that no more uranium hexafluoride would be allocated to the NRL, although it would exchange enriched uranium hexafluoride for regular uranium hexafluoride. Groves turned down an order from the NRL for additional uranium hexafluoride in October 1943. When it was pointed out that the navy had developed the production process for uranium hexafluoride in the first place, the army reluctantly agreed to fulfil the order.  Philadelphia pilot plant  Abelson's studies indicated that in order to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, steam and cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A. Solberg from the Bureau of Ships was project officer. The Philadelphia pilot plant occupied of space on a site one block west of Broad Street, near the Delaware River. The plant consisted of 102 columns, known as a \\"rack\\", arranged into a cascade of seven stages. The plant was intended to be able to produce one gram per day of uranium enriched to 6% uranium-235. The outer copper tubes were cooled by water flowing between them and the external 4-inch steel pipes. The inner nickel tubes were heated by high pressure steam at and . Each column therefore held about of uranium hexafluoride. This was driven by vapor pressure; the only working parts were the water pumps. In operation, the rack consumed 11.6 MW of power. Each column was connected to a reservoir of of uranium hexafluoride. Because of the dangers involved in handling uranium hexafluoride, all work with it, such as replenishing the reservoirs from the shipping cylinders, was accomplished in a transfer room. The columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, so the Philadelphia pilot plant eventually produced over of uranium hexafluoride enriched to 0.86 percent uranium-235, which was handed over to the Manhattan Project. The Philadelphia pilot plant was disposed of in September 1946, with salvageable equipment being returned to the NRL, while the rest was dumped at sea.  Construction  alt=A mass of steel trusses In early 1944, news of the Philadelphia pilot plant reached Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Oppenheimer wrote to Conant on 4 March 1944, and asked for the reports on the liquid thermal diffusion project, which Conant forwarded. Like nearly everyone else, Oppenheimer had been thinking of uranium enrichment in terms of a process to produce weapons grade uranium suitable for use in an atomic bomb, but now he considered another option. If the columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, then it might produce 12 kg per day of uranium enriched to 1 percent. This could be valuable because an electromagnetic enrichment process that could produce one gram of uranium enriched to 40 percent uranium-235 from natural uranium, could produce two grams per day of uranium enriched to 80 percent uranium-235 if the feed was enriched to 1.4 percent uranium-235, double the 0.7 percent of natural uranium. On 28 April, he wrote to Groves, pointing out that \\"the production of the Y-12 plant could be increased by some 30 or 40 percent, and its enhancement somewhat improved, many months earlier than the scheduled date for K-25 production.\\" Groves obtained permission from the Military Policy Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphree, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, Richard Tolman, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks to the pilot plant would take two months, but would not produce enough feed to meet the requirements of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the Clinton Engineer Works. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50 kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphree, Tolman, Cohen and Thompson estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the Military Policy Committee that it would be operational by 1 January 1945. alt=Dozens of pipes, like a giant organ Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it was decided to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be obtained from the Clinch River and steam from the K-25 powerhouse. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus fixed fee contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days. Groves, Tolman, Fox, and Wells N. Thompson from H. K. Ferguson, collected blueprints of the Philadelphia pilot from there on 26 June. The production plant would consist of twenty-one 102-column racks, arranged in three groups of seven, a total of 2,142 columns. Each rack was a copy of the Philadelphia pilot plant. The columns had to be manufactured to fine tolerances; ¬± for the diameter of the inner nickel tubes, and ¬± between the inner nickel tubes and the outer copper tubes. The first orders for columns were placed on 5 July. Twenty-three companies were approached, and the Grinnell Company of Providence, Rhode Island, and the Mehring and Hanson Company of Washington, D.C., accepted the challenge. Ground was broken at the site on 9 July 1944. By 16 September, with about a third of the plant complete, the first rack had commenced operation. Testing in September and October revealed problems with leaking pipes that required further welding. Nonetheless, all racks were installed and ready for operations in January 1945. The construction contract was terminated on 15 February, and the remaining insulation and electrical work was assigned to other firms in the Oak Ridge area. They also completed the auxiliary buildings, including the new steam plant. The plant became fully operational in March 1945. Construction of the new boiler plant was approved on 16 February 1945. The first boiler was started on 5 July 1945, and operations commenced on 13 July. Work was completed on 15 August 1945. alt=A factory on a river bend, viewed from across the river The Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) was a black structure long, wide, and high. There was one control room and one transfer room for each pair of racks, except for the final one, which had its own control and transfer rooms for training purposes. Four pumps drew per minute of cooling water from the Clinch River. Steam pumps were specially designed by Pacific Pumps Inc. The plant was designed to use the entire output of the K-25 powerhouse, but as K-25 stages came online there was competition for this. It was decided to build a new boiler plant. Twelve surplus boilers originally intended for destroyer escorts were acquired from the navy. The lower hot wall temperature due to the reduced steam pressure ( instead of the of the pilot plant) was compensated for by the ease of operation. Because they were oil-fired, a oil tank farm was added, with sufficient storage to operate the plant for 60 days. In addition to the Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) and the new steam plant (F06) buildings, structures in the S-50 area included the pumping station (F02), laboratories, a cafeteria, machine shop (F10), warehouses, a gas station, and a water treatment plant (F03).  Production  For security reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson to operate the new plant, but it was a closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it to operate the plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation. alt=Dozens of pipes, like a giant organ On 2 September 1944, SED Private Arnold Kramish, and two civilians, Peter N. Bragg, Jr., an NRL chemical engineer, and Douglas P. Meigs, a Fercleve employee, were working in a transfer room when a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride exploded, rupturing nearby steam pipes. The steam reacted with the uranium hexafluoride to create hydrofluoric acid, and the three men were badly burned. Private John D. Hoffman ran through the toxic cloud to rescue them, but Bragg and Meigs died from their injuries. Another eleven men, including Kramish and four other soldiers, were injured but recovered. Hoffman, who suffered burns, was awarded the Soldier's Medal, the United States Army's highest award for an act of valor in a non-combat situation, and the only one awarded to a member of the Manhattan District. Bragg was posthumously awarded the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award on 21 June 1993. Colonel Stafford L. Warren, the chief of the Manhattan District's Medical Section, removed the internal organs of the dead and sent them back to Oak Ridge for analysis. They were buried without them. An investigation found that the accident was caused by the use of steel cylinders with nickel linings instead of seamless nickel cylinders because the army had pre-empted nickel production. The Navy Hospital did not have procedures for the treatment of people exposed to uranium hexafluoride, so Warren's Medical Section developed them. Groves ordered a halt to training at the Philadelphia pilot plant, so Abelson and 15 of his staff moved to Oak Ridge to train personnel there. There were no fatal accidents at the production plant, although it had a higher accident rate than other Manhattan Project production facilities due to the haste to get it into operation. When the crews attempted to start the first rack there was a loud noise and a cloud of vapor due to escaping steam. This would normally have resulted in a shutdown, but under the pressure to get the plant operational, the Fercleve plant manager had no choice but to press on. The plant produced just of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced . In normal operation, of product was drawn from each circuit every 285 minutes. With four circuits per rack, each rack could produce per day. By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12, which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons. Total S-50 production was . It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week. \\"If I had appreciated the possibilities of thermal diffusion,\\" Groves later wrote, \\"we would have gone ahead with it much sooner, taken a bit more time on the design of the plant and made it much bigger and better. Its effect on our production of U-235 in June and July 1945 would have been appreciable.\\" alt=A large dark-coloured rectangular building and a smaller building with three smokestacks. In the background is the river. The steam plant is a small building with two smokestacks.  Post-war years  Soon after the war ended in August 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur V. Peterson, the Manhattan District officer with overall responsibility for the production of fissile material, recommended that the S-50 plant be placed on stand-by. The Manhattan District ordered the plant shut down on 4 September 1945. It was the only production- scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built, but its efficiency could not compete with that of a gaseous diffusion plant. The columns were drained and cleaned, and all employees were given two weeks' notice of impending termination of employment. All production had ceased by 9 September, and the last uranium hexafluoride feed was shipped to K-25 for processing. Layoffs began on 18 September. By this time, voluntary resignations had reduced the Fercleve payroll from its wartime peak of 1,600 workers to around 900. Only 241 remained at the end of September. Fercleve's contract was terminated on 31 October, and responsibility for the S-50 plant buildings was transferred to the K-25 office. Fercleve laid off the last employees on 16 February 1946. Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant buildings were utilised, not as a production facility, but by the United States Army Air Forces' Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project. Fairchild Aircraft conducted a series of experiments there involving beryllium. Workers also fabricated blocks of enriched uranium and graphite. NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint Atomic Energy Commission-United States Air Force Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project. The S-50 plant was disassembled in the late 1940s. Equipment was taken to the K-25 powerhouse area, where it was stored before being salvaged or buried.

OAR Corporation is currently managing the RTEMS project in cooperation with a steering committee which includes user representatives. Design RTEMS is designed for real- time, embedded systems and to support various open API standards including POSIX and ¬µITRON. The API now known as the Classic RTEMS API was originally based upon the Real-Time Executive Interface Definition (RTEID) specification. RTEMS includes a port of the FreeBSD TCP/IP stack as well as support for various filesystems including NFS and the FAT filesystem. RTEMS does not provide any form of memory management or processes. In POSIX terminology, it implements a single process, multithreaded environment. This is reflected in the fact that RTEMS provides nearly all POSIX services other than those which are related to memory mapping, process forking, or shared memory. RTEMS closely corresponds to POSIX Profile 52 which is \\"single process, threads, filesystem\\".

The line features 3D acceleration based upon Direct3D 7.0 and OpenGL 1.3, and all but the entry-level versions offloading host geometry calculations to a hardware transform and lighting (T&L;) engine, a major improvement in features and performance compared to the preceding Rage design. The processors also include 2D GUI acceleration, video acceleration, and multiple display outputs. \\"R100\\" refers to the development codename of the initially released GPU of the generation. It is the basis for a variety of other succeeding products. Development =Architecture= The first- generation Radeon GPU was launched in 2000, and was initially code-named Rage 6 (later R100), as the successor to ATI's aging Rage 128 Pro which was unable to compete with the GeForce 256. The card also had been described as Radeon 256 in the months leading up to its launch, possibly to draw comparisons with the competing Nvidia card, although the moniker was dropped with the launch of the final product. The R100 was built on a 180 nm semiconductor manufacturing process. Like the GeForce, the Radeon R100 featured a hardware transform and lighting (T&L;) engine to perform geometry calculations, freeing up the host computer's CPU. In 3D rendering the processor can write 2 pixels to the framebuffer and sample 3 texture maps per pixel per clock. This is commonly referred to as a 2√ó3 configuration, or a dual-pipeline design with 3 TMUs per pipe. As for Radeon's competitors, the GeForce 256 is 4√ó1, GeForce2 GTS is 4√ó2 and 3dfx Voodoo 5 5500 is a 2√ó1+2√ó1 SLI design. Unfortunately, the third texture unit did not get much use in games during the card's lifetime because software was not frequently performing more than dual texturing. In terms of rendering, its \\"Pixel Tapestry\\" architecture allowed for Environment Mapped Bump Mapping (EMBM) and Dot Product (Dot3) Bump Mapping support, offering the most complete Bump Mapping support at the time along with the older Emboss method.https://www.anandtech.com/show/536/6 Radeon also introduced a new memory bandwidth optimization and overdraw reduction technology called HyperZ. It basically improves the overall efficiency of the 3D rendering processes. Consisting of 3 different functions, it allows the Radeon to perform very competitively compared to competing designs with higher fillrates and bandwidth on paper. ATI produced a real-time demo for their new card, to showcase its new features. The Radeon's Ark demo presents a science-fiction environment with heavy use of features such as multiple texture layers for image effects and detail. Among the effects are environment-mapped bump mapping, detail textures, glass reflections, mirrors, realistic water simulation, light maps, texture compression, planar reflective surfaces, and portal-based visibility.http://alex.vlachos.com/graphics/ In terms of performance, Radeon scores lower than the GeForce2 in most benchmarks, even with HyperZ activated. The performance difference was especially noticeable in 16-bit color, where both the GeForce2 GTS and Voodoo 5 5500 were far ahead. However, the Radeon could close the gap and occasionally outperform its fastest competitor, the GeForce2 GTS, in 32-bit color. Aside from the new 3D hardware, Radeon also introduced per-pixel video-deinterlacing to ATI's HDTV- capable MPEG-2 engine. =R100's pixel shaders= R100-based GPUs have forward-looking programmable shading capability in their pipelines; however, the chips are not flexible enough to support the Microsoft Direct3D specification for Pixel Shader 1.1. A forum post by an ATI engineer in 2001 clarified this: Implementations Radeon DDR box (R100) Radeon 7500 (RV200) Radeon RV100 DDR =R100= The first versions of the Radeon (R100) were the Radeon DDR, available in Spring 2000 with 32 MB or 64 MB configurations; the 64 MB card had a slightly faster clock speed and added VIVO (video-in video- out) capability. The core speed was 183Mhz and the 5.5 Ns DDR SDRAM memory clock speed was 183 MHz DDR (366 MHz effective). The R100 introduced HyperZ, an early culling technology (maybe inspired by the Tile Rendering present in St Microelectronics PowerVR chips) that became the way to go in graphic evolution and generation by generation rendering optimization, and can be considerend the first non tile rendering-based (and so DX7 compatible) card to use a Z-Buffer optimization. These cards were produced until mid-2001, when they were essentially replaced by the Radeon 7500 (RV200). A slower and short- lived Radeon SDR (with 32 MB SDRAM memory) was added in mid-2000 to compete with the GeForce2 MX. Also in 2000, an OEM-only Radeon LE 32MB DDR arrived. Compared to the regular Radeon DDR from ATI, the LE is produced by Athlon Micro from Radeon GPUs that did not meet spec and originally intended for the Asian OEM market. The card runs at a lower 143 MHz clock rate for both RAM and GPU, and its Hyper Z functionality has been disabled. Despite these handicaps, the Radeon LE was competitive with other contemporaries such as the GeForce 2 MX and Radeon SDR. Unlike its rivals, however, the LE has considerable performance potential, as is possible to enable HyperZ through a system registry alteration, plus there is considerable overclocking room. Later drivers do not differentiate the Radeon LE from other Radeon R100 cards and the HyperZ hardware is enabled by default, though there may be visual anomalies on cards with HyperZ hardware that is defective. In 2001, a short- lived Radeon R100 with 64 MB SDR was released as the Radeon 7200. After this and all older R100 Radeon cards were discontinued, the R100 series was subsequently known as the Radeon 7200, in keeping with ATI's new naming scheme. =RV100= A budget variant of the R100 hardware was created and called the Radeon VE, later known as the Radeon 7000 in 2001 when ATI re- branded its products. RV100 has only one pixel-pipeline, no hardware T&L;, a 64-bit memory bus, and no HyperZ. But it did add HydraVision dual-monitor support and integrated a second RAMDAC into the core (for Hydravision). From the 3D performance standpoint, the Radeon VE did not fare well against the GeForce2 MX of the same era, though its multi-display support was clearly superior to the GeForce2 MX, however. The Matrox G450 has the best dual- display support out of the GPUs but the slowest 3D performance. RV100 was the basis for the Mobility Radeon notebook solution. =RV200= The Radeon 7500 (RV200) is basically a die-shrink of the R100 in a new 150 nm manufacturing process. The increased density and various tweaks to the architecture allowed the GPU to function at higher clock speeds. It also allowed the card to operate with asynchronous clock operation, whereas the original R100 was always clocked synchronously with the RAM. It was ATI's first Direct3D 7-compliant GPU to include dual-monitor support (Hydravision). The Radeon 7500 launched in the second half of 2001 alongside the Radeon 8500 (R200). It used an accelerated graphics port (AGP) 4x interface. Around the time that the Radeon 8500 and 7500 were announced, rival Nvidia released its GeForce 3 Ti500 and Ti200, the 8500 and Ti500 are direct competitors but the 7500 and Ti200 are not. The desktop Radeon 7500 board frequently came clocked at 290 MHz core and 230 MHz RAM. It competed with the GeForce2 Ti and later on, the GeForce4 MX440.

Biography Toussaint DuBois was born Oct. 8 1762 to Charles Quintin dit Dubois and Cecile (Couvret) in St- Laurent, near Montreal (Quebec), his parents having married there on Oct. 26 1753 (Charles' second marriage). Early reports stated that DuBois fought alongside Lafayette in 1777 but more recent research seems to indicate that he only arrived in Vincennes after the war of Independence.TOUSSAINT DUBOIS: POLITICAL PATRIARCH OF OLD VINCENNES Settling near Vincennes, Indiana, he became a fur trader. He married twice: first to Jeanne Bonneau, by whom he had four sons and a daughter. Jeanne Bonneau was born in 1770 in Vincennes, Indiana, and died in 1800. Their four children were: Suzanne (born 1789), Charles (born 1795), Francois (b. 1794) and Henry (b. 1792). They were married on October 6, 1788, in Indiana. After the early death of Jeannette, Toussaint DuBois married Jane Baird in 1805. Jane Baird was born in 1781 in Pennsylvania. The three sons born to Jane Baird Dubois and Toussaint Dubois were: Thomas Baird (b. 1806 in Illinois), Jesse Kilgore (b. 1811 in Illinois) and James (born circa 1810 in Illinois). As a captain, DuBois commanded the Company of Spies and Guides of the Indiana militia at the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe. He also served as a Major in the War of 1812, commanding the Kentucky Mounted Spies.Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Kentucky, Soldiers of the War of 1812, page 22. DuBois drowned in 1816 while crossing the Little Wabash River in Illinois, when he was returning from business in St. Louis, Missouri. He was buried in Vincennes.

It was first serialized in six parts in Argosy in 1932 and published in book form two years later by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. The events occur on a fictionalized version of the planet Venus, known as \\"Amtor\\" to its inhabitants. The novel contains elements of political satire aimed at communism. The novel's villains, the Thorists, start a revolution in the nation of Vepaja for their own good only, cheating the uneducated masses and killing or driving away those doctors and other highly educated that form the foundation of the society. Throughout the book the Thorists remain distant and unreal, and those few that the hero Carson Napier meets are often stupid or incompetent. The Kalkars, villains of Burroughs' other novel The Moon Maid, were also modeled on the Russian Communists.) Plot =Chapter 1= Carson Napier When the author receives a letter saying a woman in white will come to him on the night of the thirteenth, he dismisses it as nonsense. Jason Gridley calls, and the author visits him to discuss the latest news about von Horst, Tarzan, David Innes, Captain Zuppner and Abner Perry in Pellucidar. The woman appears on the thirteenth, walking through a closed door. She tells him \\"he\\" awaits a reply. Aided by his secretary Ralph Rothmund, the letter is found and a reply is sent. A few days later Carson Napier shows up at Tarzana, telling the story of his life including how he grew up in India, learning telepathy from the Hindu mystic Chand Kabi, how he lived with his mother's grandfather John Carson, and how he lost his mother. Revealing an intent to fly a rocket to Mars, he fades from view only to enter through the door again. He used telepathy for the meeting to ascertain they can uphold telepathic communication so the author may become the medium through which he tells the story of his adventures. Before returning to his rocket on Guadalupe Island, Napier leaves the author in charge of his personal fortune. =Chapter 2= Off for Mars Arriving at Guadalupe, Carson finds everything has been made ready under the surveillance of his friend Jimmy Welsh. Jimmy begs for Carson to take him along, but Carson refuses. After a final inspection (during which the rocket ship and plans for the journey are described) Carson bids his workers farewell and takes his place in the rocket. At first, everything appears to go well, but after two hours signs indicate that the rocket is moving off course. Eventually, Carson realizes that he forgot to take the Moon's gravity into account. Two days later it is clear that his new course caused by the Moon's gravity assist will take him towards the Sun and certain death. On the thirtieth day he spots a crescent. =Chapter 3= Rushing toward Venus The crescent turns out to be Venus. It becomes clear the rocket is going to hit the planet. Venus is said to be unable to support life, but Carson does not give up. As the rocket enters the atmosphere he opens its parachutes, then jumps, opening his own parachute. He discovers the air is breathable. Falling through two thick layers of clouds he is unaware of his surroundings (except for a faint luminosity from below) until the parachute gets stuck in the branches of a tree. Freeing himself from the parachute he starts descending and soon learns the trees are of enormous proportions. After climbing down a thousand feet he finds a causeway, apparently built by intelligent beings, where he encounters a hideous wild beast. He discovers a door in the bole of a tree. Hearing a voice speaking in a foreign language, he calls for help. The beast attacks, but he temporarily stops it by snaring it with a piece of rope salvaged from the parachute. Fleeing for his life Napier is rescued by three humans, armed with spears, emerging from the door. Taking him inside, the men give him food and a bed. He soon falls asleep. =Chapter 4= To the House of the King When he wakes up, Carson discovers he is in a city built in the enormous tree boles. During breakfast he tries to learn his first few words of the language. The men of the house are named Duran, Olthar and Kamlot. The women are Zuro and Alzo. After breakfast, the men take him to another house where a man named Tofar leads them to a man called Jong, who appears to have a high social status. Carson is thoroughly examined and placed in the care of a man called Danus. During the following three weeks Carson learns the language, history, and customs of Amtor, as the Venusians call their planet. Danus also shows a map, pointing out different regions of Amtor: Trabol, Strabol and Karbol. His explanations make it obvious that the Amtoran view of the world is very limited and backward. They think Amtor is the inside a hemispheric bowl floating on a sea of lava (which occasionally comes out of Venus' volcanoes), with Strabol (the torrid zone) in the center of the bowl and Karbol (the frigid zone of Trabol's hemisphere) on the rim. Neither Strabol nor Karbol have been much explored due to their respective hazards, and Carson realizes Danus is showing him an incomplete and faulty azimuthal projection of either Venus' northern or southern hemisphere. Carson tries to explain that it is the other way around, that they are on the outside of a sphere, and that their surveys should have made clear that the line of latitude bordering the frigid zone should be considerably smaller than the line of latitude bordering the torrid. Danus admits that their surveys do support Carson, but explains that a scientist named Klufar had remedied this apparent discrepancy by inventing and applying the imaginary unit. Carson muses about how crucial astronomy was to Earth navigation and mapping. On Venus, the clouds are seen as protection from the \\"fire\\" above; rare rifts in the clouds occasionally expose the \\"fire\\" (sun), or, at night, the fire's \\"sparks\\" (stars). =Chapter 5= The Girl in the Garden Carson is in the house of Mintep, king (jong) of Vepaja. Duran, father of Olthar and Kamlot, is of the house of Zar. Zuro is attached to Duran, as Alzo to Olthar. Marriage is unknown on Amtor, but couples are usually loyal. Several officers live to the left of Carson. To the right is a garden with a girl. One day five men creep into the garden. Carson follows, killing three. Guards butcher the others, then throw the bodies from the tree. Danus never mentions the incident. Danus tells the history of the Vepajans: There were four classes who lived happily by the millions on thousands of islands. A criminal, Thor, formed the Thorists, who revolted. Everyone became virtual slaves. Some escaped, forming these classless tree cities. Thorists search for them because they themselves have no intelligent people. Vepajans never get sick or grow old because of a serum. Half their women are sterile. Children are only allowed when someone dies by accident. Carson (now 27) is given blood tests for the longevity serum and is found to be filled with bacteria. He loves swimming, boxing, wrestling, and fencing. He exercises because he is overweight. The girl in the garden watches him. He smiles, she runs away. Carson thinks it might be his beard. Danus gives him a depilatory. Asking about the girl, Carson is told he should not even see her. Carson is a prisoner. His apartment is guarded, and he may not leave. =Chapter 6= Gathering Tarel Carson gets the longevity serum. Not many doctors are needed on Amtor. One day Carson sees the girl and leaps into her garden. When he touches her arm, he gets slapped, but he declares his love. Carson is summoned before Mintep, the jong. He was suspected as a Thorist spy, but now he is to be trained to collect tarel and hunt. Tarel is the strong, silky fiber from which their cloth and cordage are made. Carson is moved to the house of Duran where he is given primitive weapons. (There is an R-ray gun on Amtor, but the Thorists control the rare elements that produce the ray.) That evening he plays a Vepajan game, \\"tork,\\" with Zuro and Alzo. On the morning hunt Kamlot and Carson climb high in their tree, go through a little door, then pass to other trees. Tarel turns out to be the web of a spider. Carson saves Kamlot from a giant spider (targo), but Kamlot dies. =Chapter 7= By Kamlot's Grave While Carson carries Kamlot home for burial, he falls into a spider web and kills the targo. He climbs down to the ground (some trees tower 6000 feet and are 1000 feet around the base). He digs a grave to give Kamlot a \\"Christian burial\\" but discovers he is still alive, just paralyzed by the spider's venom. Kamlot describes a basto (a bison with the teeth of a carnivore) and the decimal system of weights and measures. Some trees are marked with numbered nails as a mapping system, and the entire map is memorized by the Vepajans. The variety of trees is described. Kamlot kills a basto, kind of like bullfighting, when Carson suddenly sees a startling sight overhead. =Chapter 8= On Board the Sofal Five \\"voo klangan\\" (the bird-men) capture Carson and Kamlot with wire nooses attached to ropes. They are carried through the air accompanied by klangan singing songs \\"vaguely reminiscent of Negro spirituals\\". They have very dark skin and are a mixture of bird and man, having feathers and bat-like wings. They fly for eight hours to the Venusian sea and a ship manned by Thorists. They are questioned and Carson tells them he is a doctor. We also learn that Kamlot's home city is called Kooaad. Thrown into the hold of the ship, Kamlot meets a friend, Honan, with the Amtorian greeting \\"Jodades\\" (luck-to-you). They learn that Duare (Doo-ah-ree) has been captured, but held on another ship. Kamlot and Carson are set to polishing the guns on deck. They fire T-rays that destroy everything. They are locked by a master key, which Carson wants. The guns and ship propulsion are explained‚Äîlor is the propulsive substance‚Äîand element 93 (vik-ro), element 97, element 105 (yor-san) are described (here Burroughs speculates about nuclear fission power). They always sail in sight of land. Honan tells Carson that Duare is \\"the hope of Vepaja, perhaps the hope of a world.\\" =Chapter 9= Soldiers of Liberty Tensions ease on the ship; Napier becomes friendly with both crew and captives. Telling stories of Earth, he makes new friends. Gamfor, Kiron, and Zog, who become the nucleus for a rebellion. Meanwhile, Carson learns about the Amtorian compass and sonar. Because the map concepts were skewed, reliance upon the maps was fraught with error‚Äîlarge areas are marked joram (ocean), but Carson believes he knows the location of Thora. Named vookor (captain) among the growing secret rebel faction, Napier later learns from Gamfor that Anoos had reported his suspicions to the ship's captain and that his friend among the ship soldiers had given him a key to the armory. Napier suggest they strike that night, but the hold is sealed when it was usually left open. During the night Anoos is murdered. =Chapter 10= Mutiny The ship's captain conducts an investigation. Napier's clever reply (said loud enough for the Soldiers of Liberty to hear) suggests Anoos despised the Thorists and was a rabble rouser. They all answer similarly. The captain retires. Napier remarks upon Amtorian time measure. At the seventh hour the mutiny commences. The battle is fierce, Kamlot participates in the attack on the ship's upper decks. The ship's officers are slaughtered, many of the soldiers joining the mutineers. Later, Kodj objects to Napier as vookor, Zog disarms him. Napier plans his assault on the Sovang (where Duare is held) from the Sofal's conning tower. Napier addresses the ship's crew, and Kodj and the malcontents as regards the attack: there will be profit for those who participate. ''' =Chapter 11= Duare Napier's officers report on the crew's temper through the night, most agree with embarking on piracy as regards Thorian shipping‚Äîsome wish to go home. Exercising caution, Napier arms the loyal hundred and confines the remainder below. Bringing the Sofal near, the Sovang is boarded. Battle ensues. Napier orders the transfer of the Sovang's prisoners (mostly women) and the removal of the Sofal's malcontents to the other ship. Kamlot later reports the virgin Vepajan princess is on board and is grateful that Napier (upon reply) personally killed the captain who affronted her. Later Napier is summoned to the princess' cabin. He whistles (Amtorian custom instead of knocking) and is astonished to see the princess is the girl from the garden! =Chapter 12= A Ship! Carson again declares his love, much to the girl's distress and anger saying the Vepajans and her father would immediately kill him. Napier restrains his impulses, questioning her. She pardons his affront due to services rendered, reveals she is not yet nineteen, says they can never speak again, and departs into another room. Amtorian language lesson regarding \\"sofal\\" and \\"sovang\\" (killer and defender). Kamlot explains majority for Vepajan females (age 20) and penalties of death in particular to royal daughters. Carson reveals his intent to marry Duare, Kamlot responds with sword, then cannot kill his friend. Napier remarks on the differences between both worlds. Kamlot becomes a confused party regarding the possible love between Napier and Duare. Days later Vilor requests audience with Napier to offer his service as guard to the janjong‚Äîdenied. \\"Voo notar!\\" (a ship!). The Sofal pursues the Thorian vessel to take her prize. An ongyan's pennant is displayed (exempt from search) and as the Sofal nears‚Äîthen presents her guns‚ÄîMoosko, the ongyan commands his soldiers to repel any boarders. =Chapter 13= Catastrophe Moosko sends the Yan racing away. Carson pursues in the Sofal. After much T-ray fire, and many casualties on the Yan, Carson catches and boards Moosko's ship. Carson is relieved that those under his command obey him rather than turn to personal looting. After destroying the Yan's guns, Carson allows her captain his freedom with the admonition to tell all he meets that the Sofal is to be obeyed. Moosko is kept hostage, housed in the cabin of Vilor, at Vilor's request. Chasing the Yan has led them near the coast of Noobol. A gale rises. Carson finds an angan with Vilor and Moosko and orders the birdman back to his quarters. Carson then visits Duare who hesitates, then allows him entrance. Carson tells her again that he loves her and Duare tells him she cannot listen. He kisses her by force and she draws her dagger. Carson apologizes and leaves. In the early morning, awakened by storm, Carson discovers Duare missing and fears she may have killed herself because of his assault. Then he finds Vilor and Moosko also missing. The lookout has been murdered. A Vepajan woman, Byea, informs Carson that Vilor was a Thoran spy. =Chapter 14= Storm A search reveals five klangan also missing. Kamlot, Gamfor, Kiron and Zog meet with Carson and reconstruct the scheme wherein Vilor abducted Duare and Moosko regained his freedom with the help of trusted klangan. Carson orders the Sofal to remain offshore until the gale abates, then launch a rescue party. Leaving the cabin, Carson is swept out to sea. He swims with the waves toward shore. The rough surf betokens death as does eternal swimming. But, Carson concludes, \\"in the midst of death there is life.\\" Fate washes him past the rocks to a sandy beach. He climbs the inlet wall and sets out across the tableland. Later, hearing fighting, he finds Duare and some klangan beset by manlike creatures. Carson charges, scattering the creatures. One angan remains alive. Duare thanks Carson perfunctorily for saving her from the kloonobargan, a word Burroughs explains. Carson offers pardon to the angan in return for faithful service. They return to the coast. Duare confesses as they travel that the rules forbidding conversation may be relaxed in their present circumstances. Speechless at first, Carson tells her about Earth. At the coast, they build a signal fire. Men on land, led by Vilor and Moosko, come to investigate as does the Sofal. Carson orders the angan to carry Duare to the Sofal; she refuses to leave. Carson grabs her, kisses her, and hands her to the angan. She protests, telling Carson that she loves him as they fly away. Carson is taken captive with that knowledge. Reception Wonder Stories in 1934 recommended the novel, saying that \\"the plot of the story is nothing new, [but] a master of fantasy, such as Burroughs, can . . . keep the story absorbing from the first page to the last\\".\\"Book Review\\", Wonder Stories, June 1934, p.114 Floyd C.

It is both a B[e] star and shell star. VV Cephei is an eclipsing binary with the second longest known period. A red supergiant fills its Roche lobe when closest to a companion blue star, the latter appearing to be on the main sequence. Matter flows from the red supergiant onto the blue companion for at least part of the orbit and the hot star is obscured by a large disk of material. The supergiant primary, known as VV Cephei A, is currently recognised as one of the largest stars in the galaxy although its size is not certain. The best estimate is , which is nearly as large as the orbit of Jupiter. Variability The fact that VV Cephei is an eclipsing binary system was discovered by American astronomer Dean McLaughlin in 1936. VV Cephei experiences both primary and secondary eclipses during a 20.3 year orbit. The primary eclipses totally obscure the hot secondary star and last for nearly 18 months. Secondary eclipses are so shallow that they have not been detected photometrically since the secondary obscures such a small proportion of the large cool primary star. The timing and duration of the eclipses is variable, although the exact onset is difficult to measure because it is gradual. Only Epsilon Aurigae has a longer period among eclipsing binaries. VV Cephei also shows semiregular variations of a few tenths of a magnitude. Visual and infrared variations appear unrelated to variations at ultraviolet wavelengths. A period of 58 days has been reported in UV, while the dominant period for longer wavelengths is 118.5 days. The short wavelength variations are thought to be caused by the disc around the hot secondary, while pulsation of the red supergiant primary caused the other variations. It has been predicted that the disc surrounding the secondary would produce such brightness variability. Spectrum The spectrum of VV Cep can be resolved into two main components, originating from a cool supergiant and a hot small star surrounded by a disk. The material surrounding the hot secondary produces emission lines, including [FeII] forbidden lines, the B[e] phenomenon known from other stars surrounded by circumstellar disks. The hydrogen emission lines are double-peaked, caused by a narrow central absorption component. This is caused by seeing the disk almost edge on where it intercepts continuum radiation from the star. This is characteristic of shell stars. Forbidden lines, mainly of FeII but also of CuII and NiII, are mostly constant in radial velocity and during eclipses, so they are thought to originate in distant circumbinary material. The spectrum varies dramatically during the primary eclipses, particularly at the ultraviolet wavelengths produced most strongly by the hot companion and its disc. The typical B spectrum with some emission is replaced by a spectrum dominated by thousands of emission lines as portions of the disc are seen with the continuum from the star blocked. During ingress and egress, the emission line profiles change as one side or the other of the disc close to the star becomes visible while the other is still eclipsed. The colour of the system as a whole is also changed during eclipse, with much of the blue light from the companion blocked. Out of eclipses, certain spectral lines vary strongly and erratically in both strength and shape, as well as the continuum. Rapid random variations in the short wavelength (i.e. hot) continuum appear to arise from the disc around the B component. Shell absorption lines show variable radial velocities, possibly due to variations in accretion from the disk. Emission from FeII and MgII strengthens around periastron or secondary eclipses, which occur at about the same time, but the emission lines also vary randomly throughout the orbit. In the optical spectrum, the HŒ± is the only clear emission feature. Its strength varies randomly and rapidly out of eclipse, but it becomes much weaker and relatively constant during the primary eclipses. Distance The distance has been estimated by a variety of techniques to be around , which places it within the Cepheus OB2 association. Some older studies found a larger distance and consequently very high luminosity and radius, but it now seems that the distance is more likely to be around , although both the Hipparcos and Gaia Data Release 2 parallax measurements imply a distance considerably below . Properties leftthumb300x300px(July 2008, outdated). Relative sizes of the planets in the Solar System and several stars, including VV Cephei A: 1\\\\. Mercury < Mars < Venus < Earth 2\\\\. Earth < Neptune < Uranus < Saturn < Jupiter 3\\\\. Jupiter < Proxima Centauri < Sun < Sirius 4\\\\. Sirius < Pollux < Arcturus < Aldebaran 5\\\\. Aldebaran < Rigel < Antares < Betelgeuse 6\\\\. Betelgeuse < Mu Cephei < VV Cephei A < VY Canis Majoris. It should be possible to calculate the masses of eclipsing binary stars with some accuracy, but in this case mass loss, changes in the orbital parameters, a disk obscuring the hot secondary, and doubt about the distance of the system have led to wildly varying estimates. The traditional model, from the spectroscopically derived orbit, has the masses of both stars around , which is typical for a luminous red supergiant and an early A main sequence star. An alternative model has been proposed based on the unexpected timing of the 1997 eclipse. Assuming that the change is due to mass transfer altering the orbit, dramatically lower mass values are required. In this model, the primary is a AGB star and the secondary is an B star. The spectroscopic radial velocities showing the secondary with equal mass to the primary is explained as being of a portion of the disc rather than the star itself. The angular diameter of VV Cephei A can be estimated using photometric methods and has been calculated at 0.00638 arcseconds. This allows a direct calculation of the actual diameter, which is in good agreement with the derived from a complete orbital solution and eclipse timings. Analysis of earlier eclipses had given radius values between and and an upper limit of .Table 4 in The diagrams of the roche lobe of VV Cephei A are contradictory, for example, the roche lobe is calculated to be about , thus the radius cannot be larger than this, although in another diagram, the roche lobe is calculated to be much larger at . The size of the secondary is even more uncertain, since it is physically and photometrically obscured by a much larger disc across. The secondary is certainly much smaller than either the primary or the disc, and has been calculated at to from the orbital solution. VV Cep A as it appears on Celestia, with Mu Cephei (The Garnet Star) also visible in the picture The temperature of the VV Cephei stars is again uncertain, partly because there simply isn't a single temperature that can be assigned to a significantly non-spherical diffuse star orbiting a hot companion. The effective temperature generally quoted for stars is the temperature of a spherical blackbody that approximates the electromagnetic radiation output of the actual star, accounting for emission and absorption in the spectrum. VV Cephei A is fairly clearly identified as an M2 supergiant, and as such, it is given a temperature around 3,800 K. The secondary star is heavily obscured by a disk of material from the primary, and its spectrum is almost undetectable against the disc emission. Detection of some ultraviolet absorption lines narrow down the spectral type to early B and it is apparently a main-sequence star, but likely to be abnormal in several respects due to mass transfer from the supergiant. Although VV Cephei A is an extremely large star showing high mass loss and having some emissions lines, it is not generally considered to be a hypergiant. The emission lines are produced from the accretion disc around the hot secondary and the absolute magnitude is typical for a red supergiant.

Shaw\\") (28 April 1928, in Stalybridge, Cheshire ‚Äì 27 November 2006, in Grantchester) was a biologist and leading British expert on academic dress. He designed the academic robes for the University of Bath UK, Trent University, Ontario and Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Venezuela. Shaw was also a patron of the Burgon Society, who are responsible for publishing a third, posthumous, edition of Shaw's Academical Dress. Biography After studying at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, George Shaw worked for a chemical company for two years, during which time he studied part-time at UMIST. In 1946, his interests having shifted from chemistry to biology, he began full-time undergraduate studies at the University of Wales, initially at Swansea before transferring to Bangor. Upon graduation, in 1950, he took up a teaching post at Deacon's School, Peterborough, and over the next three years he pursued research in cytogenetics in his spare time with assistance from colleagues at Cambridge. He submitted a dissertation based on this work to the University of Wales in 1953, and was awarded the degree of MSc by research. In 1956 he entered Wadham College, Oxford as a postgraduate research student in the Department of Botany, obtaining the degree of DPhil in 1958. After leaving Oxford he took a teaching post at Lancing College, where he remained for the rest of his career. He and his wife Mary, who had been a fellow postgraduate researcher at Oxford, married in 1958 and subsequently had two sons and two daughters. He had become interested in academic dress while at school, and began to study the subject during the course of his teaching career. He submitted an unsuccessful design for the academic dress of the newly founded University of Sussex in 1961, but was later commissioned to design gowns and hoods for several other institutions, including Trent University, the University of Bath (which in return conferred on him an honorary MA) and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var University (which also offered him an honorary degree, but he never travelled to Venezuela to collect it); also the University of Strathclyde adopted some of his suggested revisions to its scheme of academic dress in the early 1960s. In 1966 the first edition of his authoritative work on British academic dress was published, and received a positive review in The Guardian from Peter Preston, as well as a four-page vitriolic diatribe in The Oxford Magazine from his colleague and occasional collaborator Charles Franklyn. A second, much expanded edition was published in 1995, including details of all of the universities founded since the original publication, including those former polytechnics which had been accorded university status. In 1969 he was appointed a Fellow of the Institute of Biology, which adopted his suggested fellowship hood in 1979. In 1970, the University of Hong Kong invited him to submit a portfolio of his published research for consideration, and awarded him the degree of DSc. Towards the end of his teaching career, in 1980, he was awarded a Schoolmaster's Fellowship to Girton College, Cambridge, which subsequently appointed him a Fellow Commoner. When the Burgon Society was founded in 2000, he became an active founding member and one of its first fellows honoris causa, and in 2005 became one of the Society's patrons. He died of heart failure in November 2006.

She entered service during the Second World War, and had a short but eventful career, serving in Home waters and the Mediterranean. She was sunk in an air attack on Malta in 1942. The ship had been adopted by the British civil community of the Municipal Borough of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in November 1941. Construction and commissioning Legion was ordered on 31 March 1938 from the yards of Hawthorn Leslie and Company, Newcastle upon Tyne under the 1937 Naval Estimates. She was laid down on 1 November 1938 and launched just over a year later on 26 November 1939. During 1940 her main armament along with three others of the L class was changed. Twin 4 inch HA mountings were fitted and these four ships were re-classified as anti-aircraft destroyers. She was commissioned on 19 December 1940 at a total cost of ¬£445,684, which excluded items such as weapons and communications equipment supplied by the Admiralty. During trials, a number of defects were revealed, resulting in the ship being under repair at Greenock in Scotland until January 1941. Her commanding officer was, from commissioning until she was sunk in 1942, Captain Richard (Dick) Jessel. Career =Home waters= Thick clouds of black smoke as seen from Legion, during the expedition to the Lofoten islands, Norway, where troops were landed to blow up the oil tanks On completion of repairs, Legion was assigned to the Western Approaches Command at Greenock as part of the 11th Escort Group. She was deployed on convoy defence duties, and also successfully trialled a modified Radar Type 286M using a rotating instead of fixed aerial array. In February she escorted military convoys through the North Western Approaches. She set sail in support of Operation Claymore, a commando raid on the Lofoten Islands, on 1 March. Following the successful completion of these duties, she joined the 14th Escort Group. On 13 April she rescued survivors from the armed merchant cruiser which had been torpedoed in the North Western Approaches by the German submarine . Legion rescued 177 men, although another 40 went down with Rajputana. The rest of April was spent escorting convoys. In May she screened capital ships of the Home Fleet, searching for the German battleship ; but she had to refuel at Iceland, and so was not present at the sinking of the German battleship. Legion then returned to convoy escort duties. On 22 June Legion and her sister , escorted the aircraft carrier to Gibraltar, on an operation to deliver aircraft to Malta. A few days later, (on 26 June), she and other destroyers screened the aircraft carrier , the battlecruiser and the cruiser as they delivered aircraft from Gibraltar to Malta. This operation was repeated later in the month with Furious. In July Legion returned to Greenock to resume escort duties through the Western Approaches. On 20 August she was deployed to reinforce the escort of Convoy OG-71 which was on passage to the UK and had come under attack from the U-boats , and . The escorts were eventually successful in driving off the attackers; the convoy arrived at Liverpool on 25 August. =Malta convoys= In September she and her flotilla returned to Gibraltar and resumed escorting capital ships supplying aircraft to Malta. She provided cover on 24 September for the convoys of Operation Halberd. During the operation, the ships came under heavy air attack but continued onward. On her return to Gibraltar after Halberd, Legion and attacked and sank the Italian submarine with depth charges. October was spent escorting convoys to Malta. She made an unsuccessful attack on on 23 October and then rescued survivors from which had been torpedoed by west of Cape Spartel. =The sinking of HMS Ark Royal= Legion moves alongside the damaged and listing Ark Royal in order to take off survivors In November Legion was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla and escorted more convoys to Malta. On 13 November she was attacked by U-205 and carried out an unsuccessful counterattack. Meanwhile, Ark Royal was torpedoed by and disabled. Legion and her sister, stood by the stricken ship, embarking 1,560 survivors.HMS Legion's career Legion later returned to Ark Royal to transfer key personnel for damage control efforts. =Action in the Mediterranean= After Ark Royal sank under tow, Legion returned to Gibraltar, arriving on 24 November. In December she was transferred to Alexandria to serve as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. On 13 December she was part of the fleet when it intercepted the Italian cruisers and . Both were sunk in the ensuing engagement, known as the Battle of Cape Bon. The torpedo boat was able to escape. After this success the ship was deployed with Force K, to carry out attacks on Axis convoys on passage in the central Mediterranean in support of military operations. During her service with the Force she came under air attack in an engagement on 17 December that developed into the First Battle of Sirte. She then returned to Alexandria on 19 December with Force C. When the anti-submarine boom was raised to allow the ships to enter the harbour, the Italian submarine and three human torpedoes were able to penetrate into the secure anchorage. They laid explosive charges, severely damaging the battleships and , and the tanker Savona. On 28 December Legion and sank off Mersa Matruh after a two and half hour hunt following the sinking of the merchant vessel . Legion continued to escort convoys throughout January 1942. She was attacked on 17 January by north of Bardia. Although she escaped damage, Gurkha was sunk. On 27 January she had her ASDIC (sonar) equipment repaired at Malta. This work lasted until mid-February, when she was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla. Further escorts of convoys followed. When one of her convoys was attacked by ships of the Italian Fleet, the Second Battle of Sirte developed, in which Legion carried out a torpedo attack. The Italians subsequently disengaged rather than risk further torpedo attacks. Sinking and scrapping On 23 March Legion was detached to join in escorting the merchantman . During this operation, the vessels came under air attack and Legion was damaged by a near miss. The ship proceeded on one engine after successful damage control prevented her from sinking and she was beached at Malta. She was then towed to the docks on 25 March and tied up alongside the Boiler Wharf the next day. Whilst awaiting repair, the docks were the target of an air raid. Legion was hit by two bombs and sustained further serious damage when her forward magazine exploded. She rolled over and sank in the harbour, with her bridge and funnel lying on the jetty. She was cut in two during 1943 and attempts were made to refloat her. They were unsuccessful. After the end of the war, she was broken up in situ. This was not completed until 1946.

Each one is the beach-worn apex of a cone snail shell, a kind of seashell from a sea snail. Puka is the Hawaiian word for \\"hole\\" and refers to the naturally occurring hole in the middle of these rounded and worn shell fragments. These natural beads are made into necklaces. Numerous inexpensive imitations are now widely sold as puka shell necklaces. The majority of contemporary \\"puka shell necklaces\\" are not made from cone shells, but from other shells, or even from plastic. In addition, some strings of beads are currently sold that are made from cone shells, but the beads in these necklaces were not formed by natural processes. They were instead worked by hand from whole shells using pliers to break the shell down to the needed part, and then subjecting the rough results to tumble finishing, in order to give each bead more or less smooth edges in imitation of the natural wear-and- tear a shell receives when tumbled in the surf over long periods of time. The original all-natural puka shells were very easily made into necklaces, bracelets and anklets because they were naturally pierced, which enabled them to be strung like beads. Puka shell jewellery first became a popular item in Hawaii during the 1960s, as an attractive and inexpensive lei which could be made and sold on the beach where it was made. In the 1970s, this type of shell jewelry became highly sought after, and prices skyrocketed. The craftsmanship also became more refined and the lei p≈´p≈´ puka, puka shell leis were strung in graduated or matching styles, rather than the original random patterns. Many \\"legends\\" about the puka shell were created during this time, and these stories also helped sales. Natural puka shell formation textile cone snail from Australia The terminal helix of the shell of a cone snail is cone- shaped, and closed at the apex. When the empty shell is rolled over a long time by the waves in the breaking surf and coral rubble, the terminal helix of the shell breaks off or is gradually ground off, leaving the solid top of the shell intact. Given enough time, the tip of the spire of the shell usually also wears down, and thus a natural hole is formed from one side to the other. This shell fragment can be viewed as a sort of a natural bead, and is known in Hawaii as a \\"puka\\". Real puka shells are not flat: one side of the bead is slightly convex; the other is concave. The concave side of the bead clearly shows the spiral form of the interior of the spire of the cone shell. Modern substitutes Naturally-formed rounded cone shell fragments suitable to be used as beads are hard to find in large quantities, so true puka jewelry, formed entirely naturally, is now uncommon. Shell jewellery made from naturally occurring puka shells is also now more expensive because of the labor and time involved in locating and hand-picking these rather uncommon shell fragments from the beach drift. In modern times, beads cut from other types of shell, or even beads of plastic, are used to make imitation puka jewellery. Cone snail shells are sometimes harvested so that they can be chipped and ground down to make more authentic-looking puka jewellery, which is however still not genuine by the standards of the originals. A very glossy patina indicates that the shells in a necklace have been tumble polished. If the edges of the shell beads are chipped, the shells were harvested and manually broken into shape. If the \\"puka\\" or central hole is perfectly circular and parallel-sided, then the hole was drilled by humans.

They toured US and Europe with Bolt Thrower the following year. Believer disbanded in 1994; however, in March 2005, Daub announced that he and Bachman reformed the band. On November 18, 2008, Blabbermouth.net announced Believer's signing with Metal Blade Records. The fourth album titled Gabriel was released on March 17, 2009.

The band was joined by Howe Kraft (bass) and David Baddorf (guitar). They began playing melodic metal and released the cassette The Return in 1987. Later, Believer changed its style to thrash metal, as the band said: ‚ÄùWe realized that we could write thrash better than we could write anything else‚Äù. In high school, the band leader Kurt Bachman met Scott Laird, who was studying his first year as a music instructor. When Believer was recording the title track for its first studio album, the band asked Laird to compose an orchestral intro for the song. In 1989, Believer was signed to R.E.X. Records which published Believer's first album, Extraction from Mortality. The album was mostly distributed to Christian bookstores but quickly gained popularity for Believer who soon became recognized as one of Christian metal's leading groups. The song \\"Not Even One\\" appeared on Roadrunner Records' compilation At Death's Door in 1990 which was composed mostly of death metal bands. Writer Jeff Wagner noted that Believer's thrash-leaning sound was intense enough to hang amidst the heavier, more brutal and decidedly non-Christian metal bands on the compilation.

Sanity Obscure also features an anti-pollution song titled ‚ÄùNonpoint‚Äù (which the band nonpoint named themselves after) and an anti-drug song called ‚ÄùStop the Madness‚Äù, which was released as a single with the U2 cover ‚ÄùLike a Song.‚Äù Sanity Obscure was first released by R.E.X. Records to Christian market and a year later by Roadrunner Records to wider audience. The album became more popular than Believer's first album, and after the release Believer toured with the English deathgrind band Bolt Thrower and the Canadian thrash metal band Sacrifice. Joined by bands Cynic and Pestilence on the label's roster, Roadrunner Records pushed a progressive metal/thrash campaign with the three bands called \\"The Breed Beyond\\".Metal Blade Records. Believer biography Wyatt Robertson and David Baddorf left Believer before the band began recording its third album. Jim Winters joined as bassist and also played some guitar parts during the recording sessions. In 1993, Believer released its most technical, progressive, and ambitious album titled Dimensions. Kurt Bachman had been a guitar player in an industrial metal group called Under Midnight, which possibly influenced some industrial sound effects on Dimensions. The lyrics deal with the philosophical paradoxes and the ponderings of Sigmund Freud, Thomas J. J. Altizer, Ludwig Feuerbach and Jean-Paul Sartre about the existence of God. The symphonic metal suite, ‚ÄùTrilogy of Knowledge‚Äù, divided into three chapters and an intro, is a 20 minute+ epic written around the biblical story of the life of Christ and the knowledge of good and evil. ‚ÄùTrilogy of Knowledge‚Äù once again featured the orchestral compositions of Scott Laird and soprano vocals by Julianne Laird Hoge. During the Dimensions tour, Scott laird played violin and viola. After Dimensions the band went on a hiatus. In 1994, Believer agreed to mutually disband. After disbanding, Bachman went to get his degree, Daub became a Semi-Professional BMX biker, who endorses in Deluxx Bikes, while Winters joined acts such as Starkweather and Earth Crisis. = Return and Gabriel (2005‚Äì2009) = During the following years both Bachman and Daub worked in sound production at their Trauma Studios in Pennsylvania for groups such as Turmoil and Living Sacrifice. Later, Bachman continued in his medical studies, while Daub kept working in the music industry. Later in the 1990s, Daub began playing drums in a female-fronted progressive metal band called Fountain of Tears. In 2005, Joey Daub informed on his website joeydaub.com that he had begun writing new Believer material with Bachman. This announcement was reported widely, most notably through Blabbermouth.net,New BELIEVER Album In The Works? - Apr. 15, 2005, Blabbermouth .

Daub was working on mixing Fountain of Tears' new album and invited Bachman to help: \\"We just got together and started playing and having fun,\\" Bachman stated, \\"nothing serious, but the chemistry was still there and stuff started clicking. We wrote some tunes, played them for some people and then some of our friends in the industry said 'you guys should put this out, maybe there‚Äôs one or two Believer fans still out there that wouldn‚Äôt mind hearing it.'\\" The band started working on an album and completed pre-production of new songs during November 2007. On October 21, 2007 Believer launched an official MySpace page. The band's catalogue was rereleased by the Polish label Metal Mind Productions. Blabbermouth.net reported the album's recording process which began on November 24, drum tracking was completed on December 30, bass was laid down on January 28, 2008, rhythm guitar tracks were completed on February 18, and on April 7 the band announced that the album would feature \\"some very talented guests.\\" Ten days later on April 17, Deron Miller of CKY announced that he will be \\"laying down some guest solos and/or vocals\\" for the forthcoming Believer album. He commented that \\"Believer have been one of my favorite bands for 20 years so this is really exciting for me. Check out the three records they did in the '90s... All three are works of genius.\\" On August 13, it was announced that the album would also feature guest performances by Joe Rico of the band Sacrifice, with whom Believer toured in the early 1990s, and Rocky Gray of Living Sacrifice. On November 18, 2008, Blabbermouth.net announced Believer's signing with Cesspool Recordings, an imprint of Metal Blade Records owned by Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage. In an interview with Metalsucks.net, Bachman commented that the announcement about the band's re-activation had spread to the industry, and a staff member from Blabbermouth/Roadrunner Records suggested that they should contact Howard: \\"We got in touch with him and it turns out he is a big Believer fan. He knows more about the history of Believer than we do! It was really cool. So we flew him in to the studio, we worked with him over two days. Then he mentioned that he was starting this imprint with Brian Slagel from Metal Blade and he asked us if we wanted to be the first band on it.\\" Jones forwarded the band to Slagel whom reportedly replied: \\"Believer? Absolutely, lets do this.'\\" \\"It was sort of an easy process for us as far as the business end of it was concerned,\\" Bachman stated. They signed a 3-album deal with Metal Blade.DBR. Exclusive interview with Believer's Kurt Bachman. Metalsucks.net. March 26, 2009.

Bachman stated that \\"once again, the tunes are quite different.\\" Recording was completed on December 8, 2010. It was commented that \\"We decided to bring back some of the orchestral feel of 'Dimensions' by utilizing more layered guitars, keys and melody with different vocal arrangements. There is still the 'Believer' sound, but the musical progression continues for us.\\" The album, Transhuman, was released in April 2011. It was recognized as more genre-defying and experimental than the band's previous efforts. In more recent days, Guitarist Kevin Leaman did an interview on the As The Story Grows Podcast. When the interviewer asked if the upcoming new release will be put out on Metal Blade Records, Leaman said their deal with them was done and they are thinking of releasing it independently.  Music and legacy  Believer's music includes raw distortion, time changes, technical riffs and Bachman's raspy vocals. Some ambience is created with industrial elements and occasional classical music strings. The song structures are complicated and progressive. The debut is based more on straightforward thrash while Sanity Obscure took a more technical and progressive approach. Dimensions is experimental and avant-garde by its nature. The fourth album Gabriel has been described \\"a natural progression from Dimensions.\\"Believer: new music preview; behind-the-scenes footage available February 5, 2009. Blabbermouth.net The album features more processed voices and sound effects yet less symphonic elements than Dimensions. Bachman's vocals are notably higher than they had been previously. The band is noted for \\"employing female vocals, violins, cellos, and choirs, before it was ever conceived as commonplace [in metal].\\" Jeff Wagner noted that the song Dies Irae \\"can be considered a creative watershed in metal‚Äîother than Mekong Delta who regularly delivered classical-entrenched compositions, no extreme metal band had merged the genre so seamlessly and convincingly,\\" \\"and foreshadowed the operatic approach of future metal bands such as Therion and Nightwish. Believer's music has influenced several acts in the metal scene, for example the Norwegian group Extol, and American groups Living Sacrifice and Killswitch Engage cites Believer as an influence. Christianity When asked whether the members consider Believer a \\"Christian band\\" Daub replies in an interview with Metal Covenant in 2009: \\"Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves.\\" Daub comments about the lyrics that \\"We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but we did not want to preach.\\"MettleAngel. Interview Believer. Metal Covenant. 18. maaliskuuta 2009 \\"Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [laughs]. It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like ‚ÄúHey, here‚Äôs a slant. Something different. Something new and unique. Let‚Äôs go for that‚Äù. I‚Äôve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it‚Äôs a band, it‚Äôs entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don‚Äôt think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don‚Äôt want it to be one of those things where someone‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh I hate thrash music, so I won‚Äôt like Believer‚Äù. You get labeled and we‚Äôre going to have to go through labels but we‚Äôre not really comfortable with any.\\" says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.

His previous bands include The Refreshments and the Mortals. Clyne and the Peacemakers (also known as RCPM) released their eighth full-length studio album, \\"Native Heart\\", on June 30, 2017. His musical career has spanned over two decades, including several hits with The Refreshments and penning the theme song for the animated television series King of the Hill. He wrote and recorded the victory song for his hometown Major League Baseball club, the Arizona Diamondbacks, entitled The D-Backs Swing. Much of Clyne's music throughout his career revolves around life in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. He was born in Tucson and grew up in Tempe where he balanced life as a suburban kid while visiting his grandparents' ranch in southern Arizona, where, he rode horses, herded cattle and fixed fences. As a youth and young adult, his frequent trips south of the border to Mexico have influenced his music. Clyne attended college at Arizona State University, where he played with several bands. While at ASU, he did a Spanish immersion class and lived with a family in Ense√±ada, Mexico. During that same stay, he also did an ethnography for Anthropology credit of his choice of subject, Mariachis. This meant Clyne would follow them around town and interview them while buying them beers and gaining their trust. Every album since then that Clyne has written for both The Refreshments and RCPM have had mariachi horns on them. His love of a beach town on the Sea of Cortez in Sonora, Mexico called Puerto Pe√±asco (Rocky Point) came through when he decided to have his band play there for a concert in 2000. What started as a one night, one band concert there, grew into what is now a 4 day annual music festival named, Circus Mexicus. The event brings over 5,000 people and two events, the Hot Dog & a Smile and the Rock & Beach Soccer tournament both raise money for charities based in Rocky Point. Clyne owns his own tour bus and tours all over the United States every year. His other interests include his own brand of ultra premium tequila, named Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine Tequila. He also is part owner of a bar in Puerto Pe√±asco called Banditos. Clyne and his wife, Alisa Nicole Clyne, live in Tempe; they have three children.

It is located eight miles (13 km) north of Hastings and four miles (6 km) west of Rye. Features The River Brede, which flows to the south of the settlement, takes its name from the village. The name is derived from the word for breadth in Old English, and refers to the wide valley which it overlooks. The ecclesiastical parish is teamed with Udimore, Beckley and Peasmarsh; the four parish churches are St George, Brede, St Mary Udimore, All Saints, Beckley and St. Peter and St. Paul, Peasmarsh. The church of St George is a Grade I listed structure. The nave and north aisle date from the thirteenth century, while the chancel and south aisle are built in perpendicular style. It has a tower at the western end, and internally there are two monuments to the Oxenbridge family, dating from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. At the Western boundary of St George's Churchyard is the Grave of Damaris Richardson which is marked by a simple wooden cross. Nearby is Church House, an L-shaped building with one wing dating from the seventeenth century. It has two storeys and an attic, with a tiled roof. A second wing was added in the early nineteenth century, which has two storeys with a slate roof. To the north of the church building is Church Cottage and the Old Post Office, which together form another L-shaped building. Church Cottage is a weatherboarded, timber-framed building dating from the fifteenth century, while the Old Post Office probably dates from the eighteenth century. To the south of the church is a new Rectory, next to the newer portion of graveyard. The Village has a primary school, Methodist church and recreation ground. There are also two pubs; The Red Lion opposite St. George‚Äôs Church and The Broad Oak, which reopened in March 2019 after two years of closure, and threats to demolish the building for housing. It was previously known as The Rainbow Trout. A bus service connects the village to Northiam, Hastings and Rye. The parish contains a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) ‚Äì Brede Pit and Cutting. A cutting into the landscape has revealed a sequence of all known geological layers in the area. Fossilised remains in these sections provide key information for the study of palaeogeography, sedimentology and palaeoecology. Avant-garde singer-songwriter Patrick Wolf recorded parts of his 2009 album The Bachelor using the church organ at St George's, Brede. Florence Aylward (1862‚Äì1950), a composer known for her ballads, was the daughter of a Rector at Brede and was born at the Rectory. Governance Brede is part of the electoral ward called Brede Valley. This ward stretches south to Westfield with a population taken at the 2011 census of 4,715. Brede Waterworks To meet the growing demands for a drinking water supply to Hastings, trial boreholes were sunk in 1892, initially close to Brede Bridge, but then further to the west on the south side of the river. A continuous pumping test was conducted in 1896, and the boreholes were able to supply per day for six months, and so parliamentary approval was obtained for the scheme. However, landowners demanded high prices for their land, and extraction royalties for the water. Church Farm was located on the north bank of the river, and when it was offered for sale, Hastings Council bought it, assuming that water would be available beneath it. Work commenced in 1899, to sink two wells on the farm, numbered 1 and 3, while well number 2 was to the south of the river, on land sold to them by Miss Brisco. The ground conditions were treacherous, but after 4 years, the two north bank wells had reached while the south bank well had reached . Some of headings and adits to connect the wells together were also constructed. Unexpectedly, the soft ground meant that the wells had to be lined with concrete blocks, and the work cost ¬£38,412, against the original estimate of ¬£14,630. Once the underground work was completed, buildings could be constructed. As there was no road access to the site, a tramway was constructed from the site to Brede Bridge. It was of gauge, and was worked by an 0-4-0 saddle tank manufactured by W. G. Bagnall together with four 4-ton waggons. A wharf was built just upstream from Brede Bridge, and a steam crane was used to unload materials from barges into the waggons. In addition to the main pumping house, while held two triple expansion steam engines, manufactured by Tangye Ltd, and the boiler house, mechanical filters, an aerator, an underground storage tank for treated water, and four cottages for employees were constructed on the site. Treated water was pumped to Fairlight, where the service reservoir was higher than the pumping station. By 1922, the supply from the wells was inadequate, and was supplemented by water taken from the river. The situation was eased in 1928, when Hastings Council bought the Great Sanders Estate at Sedlescombe, and built a dam across the Powdermill Stream to create Powdermill Reservoir. Water from there flowed downhill to Brede Waterworks, and distance of about , from where it was pumped onwards to Fairlight. By 1928, navigation on the Brede was difficult, and could only be attempted on 2 days per fortnight. Use of barges ceased, and coal for the pumping engines was delivered by road to the tramway near Brede Bridge. By 1935, the locomotive was worn out, and was scrapped. A road was built so that coal lorries could deliver coal to the works. With demand for water still rising, work on the construction of Darwell Reservoir began in 1938, although it was not finished until 1951, due to delays caused by the Second World War. This supplied water to Brede pumps through a gravity aqueduct. Worthington- Simpson supplied a third triple-expansion pump in 1939/40, and the boilers for the engines were upgraded. The engines were used until 1964, when electric pumps replaced them. They were held in reserve, but one of the Tangye engines was scrapped in 1969, as its steam receiver had cracked.

Oregon Festival of American Music is an eclectic, thematically-based summer music festival that has been held annually in Eugene, Oregon since 1992. Produced by The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts, OFAM (as it is referred to locally) has, throughout its history, explored American music in all of its forms, but in recent years has focused its attention specifically on the Great American Songbook and related genres. Organization History Oregon Festival of American Music was founded in 1991 as a two-day summer orchestral pops festival dedicated to the championship of American classical music with American conductor Marin Alsop serving as music director and conductor. In 1993 the Festival was designated as a Resident Company of the Hult Center for the Performing Arts. By 1995 the organization had significantly expanded its vision of cultural service beyond orchestral repertoire, which led to a significant re-orientation of the festival towards a more eclectic program of American music, including jazz, historic popular, and diverse folk traditions alongside of a continued commitment to the American art music tradition. Under the principal supervision of longtime executive director James Ralph, the festival has been under the artistic leadership of a diverse group of music directors, including Cajun fiddle master Michael Doucet, American conductor James Paul and jazz pianist & composer Dick Hyman. Under the dual leadership of Hyman and Paul from 1998 to 2006, OFAM undertook a series of highly diverse and innovative programs that was established by Doucet and Paul in 1997 and continued with Paul and Hyman through 2001. In 2002 the festival introduced musical theater to its production mix and shifted its principal focus to the exploration and celebration of the American Songbook, leaving its art music initiative in the hands of its other annual concert programs. From 2007 to 2014 jazz clarinetist Ken Peplowski served at the Festival's music director, jazz saxophonist Jesse Cloninger served in that role from 2015 to 2017 and remains an active guest director along with trumpeter Byron Stripling, pianist Ted Rosenthal and vibraphonist Chuck Redd, who is the music director for the 2019 Festival. In 1996 Oregon Festival of American Music expanded its cultural service mix to include a year-round community music school and year-round concert programming in diverse musical genres packaged in several concert series and festivals. In 2002 the company moved into Eugene's original First Baptist Church building, adding cultural/educational venue management to its services. In 2004 it officially changed its name to The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts, reserving \\"Oregon Festival of American Music\\" for its flagship August festival. Programming History Oregon Festival of American Music's thematically-based programming model falls into 3 distinct periods: Under the music direction of Alsop from 1992-96 the festival was largely a summer symphony orchestra pops festival. From 1997-2001 Paul, Hyman and Ralph headed a creative effort that included a balance of orchestral, jazz, historic popular and traditional musical genres with regular commissions that often included ballet. Since 2002 the festival has focused specifically on a systematic annual treatment of the Great American Songbook, with a de-emphasis of art music in favor of musical theater and concerts that focus on various treatments of the Songbook, ranging from musical theatre and straight vocal interpretations to standards-based jazz. Themes run the range of the American musical landscape: * 1992 The Real American Folksong: George Gershwin & American Classic Tradition * 1993 Harlem Rhapsody: James P.

Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional greeting cards.  Pop-up types  A geometric diagram of the basic principle of a pop-up book: the parallelogram. Design and creation of such books in arts is sometimes called \\"paper engineering\\". This usage should not be confused with traditional paper engineering, the engineering of systems to mass-produce paper products. The artistic aspect of paper engineering is related to origami in that the two arts both employ folded paper. However, origami in its simplest form doesn't use scissors or glue and tends to be made with very foldable paper; by contrast, pop-ups rely more on glue, cutting, and stiff card stock. What they have in common is folding. = Animated books= Animated books combine three elements: story, colored illustrations which include text, and \\"two or more animated illustrations with their movement mechanisms working between a doubled page.\\". In 1938, Julian Wehr's animations for children's books were patented as \\"moving illustrations\\" that move the picture up and down and horizontally at the same time with a single movement. = Transformations= Transformations show a scene made up of vertical slats. When a reader pulls a tab on the side, the slats slide under and over one another to \\"transform\\" into a totally different scene. Ernest Nister, one of the early English children's book authors, often produced books solely of transformations. Many of these have been reproduced by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. =Volvelles= Volvelles are paper constructions with rotating parts. An early example is the Astronomicum Caesareum, by Petrus Apianus, which was made for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles in 1540. The book is full of nested circular pieces revolving on grommets. =Tunnel books= Tunnel book Tunnel books (also called peepshow books) consist of a set of pages bound with two folded concertina strips on each side and viewed through a hole in the cover. Openings in each page allow the viewer to see through the entire book to the back, and images on each page work together to create a dimensional scene inside. This type of book dates from the mid-18th century and was inspired by theatrical stage sets. Traditionally, these books were often created to commemorate special events or sold as souvenirs of tourist attractions. (The term \\"tunnel book\\" derives from the fact that many of these books were made to commemorate the building of the tunnel under the Thames River in London in the mid-19th century.) In the United States, tunnel books were made for such attractions as World's Fairs and the New York Botanical Gardens. Recently the tunnel book format has been resurrected by book artist Carol Barton and others as a sculptural book form. Artists are interested not only in the book's interior views, but also in treating the side accordions and covers as informational and visual surfaces. A selection of tunnel books by Carol Barton is archived in the special collections of Virginia Commonwealth University's James Branch Cabell Library.  History  The audience for early movable books were adults, not children. The first known movable in a book was created by Benedictine monk Matthew Paris in his Chronica Majora, which covers a period beginning in 1240. Paris attached volvelles onto some of the pages which were used by the monks to help calculate holy days. It is speculated that the Catalan mystic and poet Ramon Llull, of Majorca, also used volvelles to illustrate his theories in the early 14th century,Allie Townsend, Pop-Up Book, in \\"All-TIME 100 Greatest Toys,\\" Time, February 16, 2011. but no physical example of a paper volvelle created by him has ever been documented. Throughout the centuries volvelles have been used for such diverse purposes as teaching anatomy, making astronomical predictions, creating secret code, and telling fortunes. By 1564 another movable astrological book titled Cosmographia Petri Apiani had been published. In the following years, the medical profession made use of this format, illustrating anatomical books with layers and flaps showing the human body. The English landscape designer Capability Brown made use of flaps to illustrate \\"before and after\\" views of his designs. Page with pop-up part in Thomas Malton the Elder's book Treatise on Perspective (1775) While it can be documented that books with movable parts had been used for centuries, they were almost always used in scholarly works. In 1775 Thomas Malton, the elder published A Compleat Treatise on Perspective in Theory and Practice, on the Principles of Dr. Brook Taylor. A Compleat Treatise on Perspective is the earliest known commercially produced pop-up book since it contains three-dimensional paper mechanisms. The pop-ups are activated by pulling string and form geometric shapes used to aid the reader in understanding the concept of perspective. It was not until the very late 18th century that these techniques were applied to books designed for entertainment, particularly for children. Some of the first three-dimensional and tab activated books were produced by Ernest Nister and Lothar Meggendorfer. These books were popular in Germany and Britain during the 19th century. The great leap forward in the field of pop-up books came in 1929 with the publication of the Daily Express Children's Annual Number 1 \\"with pictures that spring up in model form\\". This was produced by Louis Giraud and Theodore Brown. Four more Daily Express Annuals followed and then Giraud setup his own publishing house, Strand Publications, this produced the groundbreaking series of Bookano books. The Bookano books are considered the first, true pop-up books for children because the pop-ups can be viewed from a full 360 degrees, not just the front side facing the viewer. There were seventeen Bookanos before the series came to an end with the death of Giraud in 1949. In the United States, in the 1930s, Harold Lentz followed Giraud's lead with the production of the Blue Ribbon books in New York. He was the first publisher to use the term \\"pop-up\\" to describe their movable illustrations.Steven Miller, Waldo Hunt, 1920-2009; The 'King of the Pop-Ups' Made Books Spring to Life, The Wall Street Journal, November 24, 2009.Ann Montanaro, \\"A Concise History of Pop-up and Movable Books\\", The Pop-up World of Ann Montanaro (exhibition), Rutgers University Libraries. The next advance in the field was made by the astoundingly prolific Vojtƒõch Kuba≈°ta working in Prague in the 1960s. His lead was followed by Waldo Hunt in the US with his founding of Graphics International. He and two companies he established, Graphics International and Intervisual Books, produced hundreds of pop-up books for children between the 1960s and 1990s. Although intended for US audiences, these books were assembled in areas with lower labor costs: initially in Japan and later in Singapore and Latin American countries such as Colombia and Mexico. Hunt's first pop-up book was Bennett Cerf's Pop-Up Riddle Book, published by Random House as a promotion for Maxwell House Coffee and showcasing the work of humorist Bennett Cerf, who was then president of Random House. The team of Waldo Hunt and Christopher Cerf created a total of 30 more children's pop-up books for publication by Random House, including books that featured Sesame Street characters. According to Bennett Cerf (in his book At Random), pop-up books were profitable for Random House. In addition to his collaborations with Christopher Cerf at Random House, Hunt produced pop-up books for Walt Disney, a series of pop-up books based on Babar, and titles such as Haunted House by Jan Pienkowski and The Human Body by David Pelham.Valerie J. Nelson, \\"Waldo Hunt dies at 88; entrepreneur revived the pop-up book as art form\\", Los Angeles Times, November 22, 2009. An exhibition of pop-up books curated by Carol Barton was shown at the Smithsonian Institution's Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York. Her pop-up books, movable books, and tunnel books are in the collections of The Getty Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum in London, The Smithsonian Institution, and the Museum of Modern Art. Notable works Some pop-up books receive attention as literary works for the degree of artistry or sophistication which they entail. One example is Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy, by Matthew Reinhart. This book received literary attention for its elaborate pop-ups, and the skill of its imagery, with The New York Times saying that \\"calling this sophisticated piece of engineering a 'pop-up book' is like calling the Great Wall of China a partition\\".\\"A Galaxy in Your Face\\", The New York Times Book Review, November 11, 2007, children's book section. The 1967 Random House publication Andy Warhol's Index, was produced by Andy Warhol, Chris Cerf and Alan Rinzler, and included photos of celebrities together with pop-up versions of Warholesque images such as a cardboard can of tomato paste, as well as a plastic tear-out recording, an inflatable silver balloon, and other novelties. Pop-up book artist Colette Fu designed China's largest pop-up book. In 2008, she was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to create pop-up books of the 25 ethnic minorities residing in Yunnan Province, China. Her work can be found in the Library of Congress, Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Museum of Women in the Arts.  Associations  Since 1993, the Movable Book Society has provided a forum for artists, book sellers, book producers, collectors, curators, and others to share enthusiasm and exchange information about pop-up and movable books. The organization also awards industry prizes for best paper engineer (trade and artists‚Äô book) and excellence in paper engineering by an undergraduate or graduate student.

It is located six miles (9.7 km) north of Bexhill, and three miles (5 km) southwest of Battle. The village was first documented in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it was recorded \\"there is a little church serving the hall\\". It is one of the oldest settlements in the area, with Romano British period archaeological remains. The village once consisted of two manors: Catsfield and Catsfield Levett. Thomas Lyvet (Levett) held the lordship of the manor of Catsfield in 1445 but forfeited it, along with the lordship of Firle, for his debts. But the manor of Catsfield Levett remained in the Levett family for centuries, and in the seventeenth century a Levett heiress carried it into the Eversfield family. (Richard Lyvet of Firle was lord of the manor of Catsfield in 1431.) With a fortune built on ancestral landholdings and later on iron making, the Levetts held land across Sussex. The parish church is dedicated to St Laurence.Photos of the church Catsfield is located in the Sussex Weald within the designated landscape the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Governance At a local level, Catsfield is governed by a parish council which is responsible for street lighting, allotments and recreational areas. They provide a local voice to the district and county councils. The parish council consists of seven councillors. In the May 2007 election, the seven councillors were uncontested. Rother District council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Catsfield is within the Crowhurst ward, along with the parishes of Ashburnham and Penhurst, Crowhurst, and part of Battle. In the May 2007 election Crowhurst ward was won by the Conservative candidate. East Sussex county council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Catsfield falls within the Battle and Crowhurst ward. Kathryn Margaret Field, Liberal Democrat, was elected in the May 2005 election with 48.8% of the vote. The UK Parliament constituency for Catsfield is Bexhill and Battle. Huw Merriman was elected in the May 2015 election. At a European level, before the United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020, Catsfield was represented by the South-East region, which held ten seats in the European Parliament. The June 2004 election resulted in four Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two UK Independence, one Labour and one Green being elected, none of whom lived in East Sussex.

While excavating for a rain-water drain about 6 feet from the house and at a depth of 10‚Äì12 inches, a workman James Hodgkin found a pottery vessel of about one gallon capacity. It was of earthen colour and rather soft paste. It was full of earth and in the bottom there was chalk-like material. About a yard away he found another vessel, smaller and of thinner material which contained the remains of fine bones. The British Museum assessed the smaller vessel as the remains of a small Roman vase commonly found with cremated burials.Sussex Archaeological Society Sussex Notes and Queries H.Blackman ‚Äì Pages 92‚Äì3 ‚Äì 1 1926 Monument No. 414623 is located at Watermill Stream.National Monuments Record Monument No. 414623 NMR No. TQ 71 SW 4 The site of a forge having a large bay with cinder below it.

The medieval church bells are hung in the tower. The first and smallest bell is inscribed \\"Sum Rosa Pulsata Mundi Katerina Vocata\\" (When I am struck I am the Rose of the World and am called Katerina); the second bell is inscribed \\"Dulcis Sisto Melis Campana Vocor Gabrielis\\" (I am the honey voiced bell called Gabriel). Both bells were cast probably in the vicinity of the church during the late 14th or early 15th century by William Wodewarde of London. The third and largest bell is said to have been the greatest ever cast by William Hull of Hailsham and has the inscription \\"William Hull of Hailsham made me in 1685. John Maynard, John Blaskit, Churchwardens\\". The church clock was made and installed during the late 19th century by J. W. Benson of Ludgate Hill, London. The most venerable oak of Sussex was once to be found in the churchyard dating from the time before the Conquest. It was lost in the 1960s. The Methodist church was in existence from 1912 to 2000.Catsfield Methodist Church; GenUKI Etymology Many suggestions have been made about the origin of the name Catsfield but it is unlikely its true derivation will ever be known as the early Britons, Romans and Saxons left few written records. One theory advanced is the village takes its name from a North Saxon or Belgic tribe called the Catti, who were known to have settled in Sussex in Roman times, and another based on a tradition that a church was built in Catsfield by St. Chad of Lichfield, or his brother St.Cedd who was active in the South East, hence Caedsfeld or Chaddesfield. The earliest written record of Catsfield (as Cedesfille) is contained in the Domesday Book of 1086.The Church of Saint Laurence and Parish of Catsfield, nd, anon Phenology William Markwick, an inhabitant of Catsfield and a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, made pioneering observations in phenology, the times at which natural events such as when the first call of the cuckoo is heard or when the first primrose blooms.

The band is considered to be one of the cornerstones of the \\"Denver Sound\\" - music which includes elements of country blues, gospel and folk. The 'Auto Club' is sometimes labeled as Americana and as Southern Gothic as well, due to the juxtaposition of apocalyptic and religious imagery with stories concerning alcohol abuse, violence, and relationships gone awry. History =Formation= Original lineup The constant in the band has been Slim Cessna, formerly a member of The Denver Gentlemen along with David Eugene Edwards and Jeffery-Paul of 16 Horsepower. Naming of the band The name \\"Slim Cessna's Auto Club\\" originally came about as a tribute to Cessna's friend who had a car collection: '' =Early years= The band has gone through somewhat of a genre \\"identity crisis\\" - starting out as a traditional country music band, then evolving their sound into something more nebulous and less easily classified. In a 2009 interview, Cessna described the music as more \\"folk\\" than \\"alt country\\" and simply \\"American.\\" John Rumley likened it to 1970's rock music, while Munly was unsure whether SCAC could be considered a \\"rock band.\\" Career =Early works= Slim Cessna's Auto Club is the debut studio album of the band.

The label is home to all recordings by SCAC, Denver Broncos UK, and Munly's side projects. Slim Cessna said that the reason for creating this label was because he wanted to \\"take control\\" of the band's musical catalog. Releases All of the band's albums, except for their self-titled album, were given a re-release in March 2015. The first official release by the label, also in March 2015, was a re-issue (this time for the US) of \\"SCAC 102 An Introduction For Young And Old Europe.\\" The label's second release, in October 2015, was the debut album by DBUK (Denver Broncos UK), Songs One Through Eight.

They have toured with Nathaniel Rateliff & Night Sweats and Kid Congo & the Pink Monkey Birds. Their Spring and Summer 2020 tours with The Legendary Shack Shakers and The BellRays were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are re-scheduled for 2021. Other endeavors =Side projects= Denver Broncos UK The Denver Broncos UK is an experimental folk quartet that first recorded together in 2006. The band originally formed with just Munly, Lord Dwight Pentacost, and Slim Cessna as members. The current members are: Munly (vocals, guitar), Dwight (vocals, autoharp, melodica, banjo, percussion), Slim (vocals, percussion, washtub drum), and Rebecca Vera (vocals, cello, keys, percussion). The band is now more commonly referred to as DBUK to dispel any notion that they are connected to the Denver Broncos football team or the Bronco's fanbase in the United Kingdom. They have released two albums: Songs One Through Eight (2015) and Songs Nine Through Sixteen (2019). A double-album titled Songs One Through Sixteen was released in November 2018 through European record label Glitterhouse Records. They also recorded a cover of \\"Top Yourself\\" by The Raconteurs for the album Rockin' Legends Pay Tribute to Jack White, released in November 2013. Munly and The Lupercalians 'Munly and the Lupercalians' was founded by Munly around 2006‚Äì2007. The original lineup of the band included many, if not all, members of his first side project, The Lee Lewis Harlots. The current lineup contains most of the current members of Slim Cessna's Auto Club: Munly, Slim Cessna, Lord Dwight Pentacost, Rebecca Vera, and Andrew Warner. On stage, each band member, except for Munly, wears a costume that identifies them as a potential member of the fictional town of 'Lupercalia.' The goal is to produce a multi- album set tentatively titled The Kinnery Of Lupercalia, which is all about the town and its colorful residents. Its residents have been described as \\"families who interact with each other\\" and Lupercalia as an \\"imagined community of Legions & clans where we are not sure who is a deity and who is not.\\" Although an unauthorized demo album was released in 2009, the first official album by the band, Petr & the Wulf, was released in October 2010 through Alternative Tentacles. It was re-released through their own independent record label, SCAC Unincorporated, around 2015. The work is loosely based on the Peter and the Wolf composition by Sergei Prokofiev, and is said to be a prequel to the stories of Lupercalia told over a span of four albums. =Other appearances= In 1996, SCAC appeared twice on More Than Mountains: A Benefit For Colorado Conservation, a compilation album released by W.A.R Records. \\"Champagne Like A Lady\\" and \\"Blindman\\" were included. The song \\"Earthquake\\" was featured on the Smooch Records compilation album Radio 1190: Local Shakedown, Vol. 1 in 2000. Many of the songs on Buried Behind the Barn were also featured on Crossbreeding Begins at Home, another Smooch Records compilation album, which received a limited release of 200 copies in January 2004. \\"Angel\\" was featured on Radio 1190: Local Shakedown, Vol. 2 in 2004. Munly and Slim Cessna were featured in a segment of \\"Seven Signs: Music, Myth, and the American South\\" (2008), a film by JD Wilkes of Th' Legendary Shack Shakers. Munly recited the original story titled \\"D√∂der Made Me Do It\\" and joined Slim in performing an acoustic version of \\"Children of the Lord\\". The band performed a cover of \\"Ain't My Problem Baby\\" for Axels & Sockets, the third and final installment of The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project, released by Glitterhouse Records on May 2, 2014. They recorded in-studio performances for Daytrotter/Paste Magazine in 2012 and 2017 in Rock Island, Illinois.

He contested in the 2019 Indian general election as an independent candidate for the Bengalore Central Lok Sabha constituency, but lost. Prakash Raj barely secured 2.5% of votes in the election. Controversies Prakash has been involved in several controversies. He was banned by Telugu film producers six times in the past. Prakash reacted to it by saying: > \\"If people who work with me say that I play hide and seek, why do they > repeat me? Why am I in Mahesh's nine films out of his ten. Why don't you > judge me with my work? How I go about it is not important. I don't go by the > rules. I put my foot down, I don't take mediocrity. There are certain > locations where I can come only at 12 in the morning. I don't go by the > rules.\\" It was the first time that an actor was banned by the Telugu industry. Telugu film industry insiders interpret the ban as a conspiracy by several big heroes and producers. Problems started during the shooting of films such as Pawan Kalyan's Jalsa, NTR Jr's Kantri, and Allu Arjun's Parugu. There was controversy for his naked appearance in a sequence in his latest Telugu release Ongole Githa. The film got an \\"A Certificate\\" from the Censor Board. Prakash reacted by saying: \\"I did not shed my clothes for creating sensation, I had no plans to star in that sequence. The script demanded it; as an actor, I have to abide by the script. Director Bhaskar told me that it would be an 'important' sequence in the context of the film and I just carried out his instructions.\\" Several Kannada organisations staged protests in front of theatres since they felt that some of the dialogue in a scene in the Hindi film Singham, starring Ajay Devgan and Prakash were derogatory against the Kannadigas. The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) had demanded the deletion of all \\"objectionable\\" dialogue from the movie. The screening was stopped in major centres of Karnataka. The controversial scene starts off with Prakash threatening Ajay that he would bring 1,000 people from the Karnataka border to thrash him. Ajay (who plays Bajirao Singham, a Maratha), retorts that one lion would suffice to shoo away a thousand dogs. The controversy assumes significance in the backdrop of the decades-old border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra. Kannada protesters also felt that Prakash, being a Kannadiga should have told the team that it is not right. Prakash reacted to it to the Kannada and the Telugu media by saying: \\"I am a Kannadiga myself and I love my mother tongue Kannada. I'm very proud of my community and would never deliberately do anything to hurt my people. How would I allow conversations that provide pain to people of Karnataka in any movie in which I am cast? There is nothing controversial about the dialogue. I am a Maratha in the movie, the controversy has started just because I am a Kannadiga and I used the word 'Karnataka border' in the film because the villain in the film stays in Goa, the Karnataka border.\\" Finally the dialogue was removed, and the whole team of Singham including the director, Rohit Shetty, the production house \\"Reliance Big Entertainment\\" and Prakash apologised to all the Kannadigas; the issue was resolved.

Howe (2003). Design Principles for Kinematic Architecture. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Construction in the 21st Century (CITC-II). 10‚Äì12 December 2003, Hong Kong. Construction Kit-of-parts construction is a special subset of pre- fabrication that not only attempts to achieve flexibility in assembly and efficiency in manufacture, but also by definition requires a capacity for demountability, disassembly, and reuse. Kit-of-parts structures can be assembled and taken apart in a variety of ways like a construction toy. Architecture Kit-of-parts architecture involves organizing the individual parts and raw material in a building into assemblies of standard easy-to- manufacture components, sized for convenient handling or according to shipping constraints. The construction of the building is carried out on the assembly level as opposed to the raw material level. The architect defines a parts library describing every major assembly in the building. The assemblies are conceived in a systematic way, based on certain rules such as increment, size, or by shape grammar. Standard, simple connections between the assemblies are carefully defined, so the number of possible shapes and appearance the parts can take is limitless. Philosophy Kit-of-parts philosophy goes hand in hand with advanced manufacturing, automation, and computer and information technologies. Handling multiple identical components as instances of a master element is an efficient use of the computer in the planning stage, and use of standard components can take advantage of mass-production and mass- customization manufacturing technologies.A.S. Howe; I. Ishii; T. Yoshida (1999). Kit-of-parts: A review of object-oriented construction techniques. Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC16). 22‚Äì24 September 1999, Madrid, Spain. London: International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction (IAARC). MESR Some engineering fields refer to kit-of-parts using the acronym MESR, which stands for the following: ‚Ä¢ Modular ‚Äì Systems and subsystems are designed such that discrete unit processes can be replaced with upgraded / enhanced technology as it becomes available. ‚Ä¢ Extensible ‚Äì Initial components and subsystems delivered with a structure or vehicle are not discarded or replaced as additional unit processes are added during subsequent stages of development. ‚Ä¢ Scalable ‚Äì Components and subsystems can be coupled / decoupled as required to accommodate specific design loads. ‚Ä¢ Reconfigurable ‚Äì Components and subsystems can be moved between locations and / or subsystems to perform a similar or identical function.

Their songs, with such titles as \\"A Power Tool Is Not A Toy\\", \\"Do The Heimlich\\" and \\"Christmas In Japan In July\\", were often satirical. They were regular performers at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel in Providence and had a rather large following. In 1979 they released the single \\"Complex World/Beer\\" on Genius Records. \\"Complex World\\" became a local hit getting airplay on local radio. They broke up shortly thereafter due to conflicts over band direction. David Hansen moved to New York and formed the no wave band Cool It Reba in 1981. In 1987, Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel was in danger of closing so owner Rich Lupo came up with an idea. Lupo's bartender Jim Wolpaw was nominated for an Oscar for a short film he had done, so they threw a benefit concert and filmed it and wrote a sub-plot about a club closing. In the process they got The Young Adults to reform to play a few shows at Lupo's in July 1987. The results were released as the film (It's A) Complex World (named after the Young Adults song) and The Young Adults' Helping Others album.

Planetary surface construction can be divided into three phases or classes, coinciding with a phased schedule for habitation:Kennedy 2002Smith 1993 ‚Ä¢ Class I: Pre-integrated hard shell modules ready to use immediately upon delivery. ‚Ä¢ Class II: Prefabricated kit-of-parts that is surface assembled after delivery. ‚Ä¢ Class III: in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) derived structure with integrated Earth components. Class I structures are prepared and tested on Earth, and are designed to be fully self-contained habitats that can be delivered to the surface of other planets. In an initial mission to put human explorers on Mars, a Class I habitat would provide the bare minimum habitable facilities when continued support from Earth is not possible. The Class II structures call for a pre-manufactured kit-of-parts system that has flexible capacity for demountability and reuse. Class II structures can be used to expand the facilities established by the initial Class I habitat, and can allow for the assembly of additional structures either before the crew arrives, or after their occupancy of the pre-integrated habitat. The purpose of Class III structures is to allow for the construction of additional facilities that would support a larger population, and to develop the capacity for the local production of building materials and structures without the need for resupply from Earth. To facilitate the development of technology required to implement the three phases, Cohen and Kennedy (1997) stress the need to explore robust robotic system concepts that can be used to assist in the construction process, or perform the tasks autonomously. Among other things, they suggest a roadmap that stresses the need for adapting structural components for robotic assembly, and determining appropriate levels of modularity, assembly, and component packaging. The roadmap also sets the development of experimental construction systems in parallel with components as an important milestone.

They are currently members of the and play at Mayesbrook Park in Dagenham. History The origins of the modern club are unclear, with several potential claims; Barking Institute was either formed around 1896 as Barking Working Lads' Institute (or possibly earlier as Barking Working Men's Institute) or was a renamed Barking Rovers, who had been established in 1880 and later renamed by the Church Institute when they took over running it.Club history Barking FC They won the Essex Senior Cup in 1893‚Äì94 and 1895‚Äì96, before becoming champions of Division One of the South Essex League in 1898‚Äì99, the Leyton & District League in 1899‚Äì1900, Division Two of the South Essex League in 1900‚Äì02 and Division Two A in 1901‚Äì01, before changing its name to Barking in 1902. They also played in the London League, winning Division One A in 1909‚Äì10, before winning the South Essex League again in 1911‚Äì12, a season in which they also won the London Senior Cup for the first time. In 1912 Barking became founder members of the Athenian League, but withdrew after only two matches and their record was expunged. In 1919 the club changed its name to Barking Town, going on to win the Essex Senior Cup in the 1919‚Äì20 season. The following season they won the Premier Division of the London League and the London Senior Cup, before rejoining the Athenian League in 1923. The 1926‚Äì27 season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup, eventually losing to Gillingham in a replay. They also reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup, where they lost 3‚Äì1 to Leyton, but did win the London Senior Cup for a third time. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 1928‚Äì29, but lost 6‚Äì0 at Exeter City. In 1932 they reverted to the name Barking, and in 1934‚Äì35 won the Athenian League title. Following World War II, Barking won the 1945‚Äì46 Essex Senior Cup. In 1952 they switched to the Isthmian League, but had to wait until 1978‚Äì79 before winning the league again; during that period they won further Essex Senior Cup titles in 1962‚Äì63 and 1969‚Äì70. The 1978‚Äì79 season also saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup, defeating Yeovil Town in the first round, before losing 2‚Äì1 at home to Aldershot, as well as winning the London Senior Cup for a fourth time. The following season they reached the second round again, defeating Third Division Oxford United before losing 3‚Äì1 to Reading. In 1981‚Äì82 they took Gillingham to a replay in the second round, losing 3‚Äì1. Their last appearance in the second round came in 1983‚Äì84, when they lost 2‚Äì1 at Plymouth Argyle. A seventh Essex Senior Cup final win was achieved in 1989‚Äì90. They remained in the Isthmian League Premier Division until relegation to Division One at the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season. After finishing bottom in 1995‚Äì96 the club was relegated to Division Two. In 2001 Barking ceased to exist when they merged with East Ham United to form Barking & East Ham United. However, when the new club folded in 2006, Barking were re-established and joined the Essex Senior League. In 2016‚Äì17 the club won the Essex Senior League, earning promotion to the North Division of the Isthmian League. At the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season they were transferred to the South Central Division. Ground Barking Institute originally played at the Recreation Ground in Barking Park, before moving to Vicarage Field, which had been in use by Barking Rovers since 1884. Floodlights were installed in 1958 and they were the first Isthmian League club to play a league match under lights. In 1973 the club were forced to leave the ground by the council and moved to Mayesbrook Park. The club brought the floodlights from Vicarage Field and installed a temporary trailer stand on the northern side of the pitch.Jon Weaver (2006) The Football Grounds of Essex Metropolitan, pp7‚Äì8 This was later replaced by a permanent stand with 210 seats and standing for 450. An uncovered terrace was installed behind the western end of the pitch, which had a roof added in 2001 when Barking merged with East Ham United.

It is native to eastern Australia. It occurs from southeast Queensland to the south coast of New South Wales. It is generally a coastal species and is not found inland. Etymology The specific name tyleri honours Michael J. Tyler, an Australian herpetologist.  Description  A pair of Tyler's tree frogs in amplexus: the male is in typical breeding yellow colouration. This frog is grey-brown to fawn (of various shades) on its dorsal surface, and a whitish-yellow on its ventral surface. Females are larger than males and reach a maximum size of about 50 mm. It has green flecks on the back. The iris is golden in colour and it has cross-shaped pupils. This species is very similar to the Peron's tree frog, (Litoria peronii). The easiest way to tell them apart is by call, but L. peronii has strong black and yellow marbling in the thighs, armpits, hands and feet. L. tyleri has only faint yellow and brown marbling in the legs and armpits, lacking marbling in the hands and feet. This species lacks a strong black line above the tympanum, this line is present in L. peronii. As it is an arboreal frog, the toe pads are larger than its toes and fingers, allowing it to grip well on branches. Its hands are partially webbed, its toes are completely webbed, and the tympanum is visible. During breeding, males can turn a very strong yellow colour.  Ecology and behaviour  This species inhabits coastal forest and cleared land. It is normally found around permanent dams, swamps, and ponds. Males call from vegetation around the water body during spring and summer, often after rain. The call of this species resembles a short laughing noise, similar to that of the Peron's tree frog, but without a downward inflection.  As a pet  It is kept as a pet; in Australia, this animal may be kept in captivity with the appropriate permit. References * Stephen Richards, Richard Zweifel. 2004.

The A28 road to Canterbury and Hastings passes through it. Governance The lowest level of government is the Northiam parish council, which is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. They also provide a voice into the district council meetings. The parish council comprises nine councillors with elections being held every four years. Rother District council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Northiam lies within the Rother Levels ward, which provides two councillors. East Sussex county council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Northiam falls within the Northern Rother ward. The UK Parliament constituency for Northiam is Bexhill and Battle. At European level, Northiam is represented by the South-East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. Landmarks There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the parish. Officially designated as Northiam, it refers to a disused and partially flooded quarry on the outskirts of Northiam village. It is of geological, palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographic interest. The historic house Great Dixter is found within the village. Many parts of the village are listed including Frewen College (formally Brickwall House School), which is a day and boarding school for dyslexic children. It is believed to have been the first such school in the country, set up by Admiral Frewen. Centred on a Grade 1 listed Jacobean mansion named Brickwall after the extensive boundary walls, many period features have been retained in both the house and gardens. Brickwall is where Elizabeth I's slippers could for many years be found, given as a memento after she rested under the oak on Church Road. The slippers were retained by the Frewen family when the rest of the property was given to The Frewen Educational Trust in 1972. Frewen College, Grade I  St. Mary's Church and war memorial  The parish church is dedicated to St Mary which is home to six bells and over the years was funded and supported by the Frewens (which is now the private school).

UK's first green village Northiam was in contention to be the UK's first green village, with plans for a biomass power station providing power to the whole village. The first application for planning permission was refused in 2009. Following significant local objection, particularly around concerns over increased lorry traffic, there was no biomass plant constructed. St Francis Fields The Blue Cross animal charity which ran a rescue centre within the village closed down around 2015. It had originally opened in the 1960s. The Blue Cross chief executive, Kim Hamilton had published this proposal via a press release on 26 January 2010. Following the vacation of the site there were several attempts by the charity to obtain planning permission for a large number of houses on the site. All of these proposals were refused by Rother District Council. As of January 2020 the land has been owned by the Parish Council. It has been renamed St Francis Fields. It will now be used by the community as public open space, a stables and possibly craft areas. The site includes extensive fields and woodlands running through the heart of the village. Public Houses Northiam once had at least 5 public houses. The original Railway Hotel by Northiam Station is now an Indian Restaurant. The only existing Public House is the Rose and Thistle (renamed The Muddy Duck) a Grade II* listed building but it is currently unoccupied and in a neglected state. The site is located at the entrance of St Francis Fields and would have been of strategic planning importance had that land been redeveloped. Public transport The nearest mainline train station is Rye. However the closest station is Doleham being 6.5 miles, but this station is not served by regular stopping trains. Hourly bus services (except Sunday) operate to Tenterden, Rye, and Hastings. The bus services are operated by Stagecoach in Hastings. The bus route 344 runs from Northiam (Coppards Lane) and Hastings, via Rye. Route 340/341 runs from Tenterden to Hastings via the Westfield and the Conquest Hospital. Similarly the bus route 2 runs between Hastings and Ashford International, passing through Westfield, Brede, Broad Oak, Northiam and Tenterden. The Kent and East Sussex Railway manages Northiam station which operates steam trains for tourists between Bodiam and Tenterden. Road in London A residential street in Woodside Park Garden Suburb, North London is named Northiam--this follows the nomenclature of Woodside Park whereby nearly all streets in the suburb are named after villages, rivers and places in East Sussex.  Northiam Parish Council  Northiam has nine parish councillors elected by the village parishioners. The council usually meet once a month for a general meeting and sometimes twice a month if there are planning applications to be looked at. The Parish Council have an office located at the Village Club in the centre of the village.  Schools  There are two main schools in Northiam. Northiam Primary school is located at the southern end of the village. The school has had a new community sports hall built which is used by the school during the day and for community sporting clubs in the evenings and school holidays. The second school is Frewen College which specialises in supporting young people aged from 7 to 19 whose education has been adversely affected by dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, dyscalculia, or speech and language difficulties. Founded in 1910 we it is believed that Frewen College is the oldest such school in the country.  Footpaths  Northiam is fortunate enough to be located along the route of the Sussex Border Path. Northiam also has public footpath walks to Beckley, Newenden, Ewhurst Green and Staplecross. The local walking group Northiam Footpath Group set up in 1994 provides organised walks for local people while aiming to promote and encourage walking as a healthy, sociable and enjoyable form of exercise, while exploring the surrounding countryside in a safe manner, to keep footpaths open; maintaining the network of local and adjoining Public Rights Of Way.

Between 1976 and 1997, a rebadged version of the Caravan sold as the Nissan Homy, which was introduced as an independent model in 1965. Outside Japan, the Caravan was also sold as either the Nissan Urvan or Nissan King Van, or earlier with Datsun badging. All generations use a cabover approach due to Japanese Government dimension regulations that annually tax larger vehicles, and the cabover approach maximizes interior space while remaining within defined exterior dimensions. Prior to 1973, the Caravan's twin, the Homy had been offered as a standalone generation from 1965 until 1976. The Homy was built and sold by the Prince Motor Company before the merger of Nissan in 1965 and the Homy was the first vehicle to be acquired by Nissan. After the merger in August 1966, because Nissan didn't have a large passenger platform, the Prince Homy was \\"badge engineered\\" as the Caravan, and the brand name was changed from Prince to Nissan. The merger was complete by 1970. It shared a chassis with the Prince Homer, a medium-duty cabover pickup truck. The second generation Homy of 1976, was marketed as a twin to the 1973-era Nissan Caravan, sold at the Nissan Prince Store dealerships, while the Caravan was exclusive to Nissan Bluebird Store locations. The first generation series B640 which was changed to Nissan series T20 was built from 1965 to 1976, the second generation E20 was built from 1976 to 1980, and the third generation E23 was built from 1980 to 1986. The final generation E24 was built from 1986 to 1999, and replaced by the Nissan Elgrand. Mechanically, the Nissan Caravan and the Nissan Homy were identical. Its traditional competitor from Toyota is the HiAce. Nissan's largest passenger van is the Nissan Civilian, introduced in 1959, and their smaller platform was the Nissan Vanette.  First generation (B640); (1965-1973)  The Prince Homy (B640) was the passenger van version of the Prince Homer light duty truck, and had a seating capacity of up to 15 people. In 1966 as the Prince-Nissan merger began, it was initially called the Nissan Homy Prince, sharing load carrying duties with the Prince Skyway, and Prince Gloria station wagons; the Prince name became a dealership network within the Nissan organization in 1970. The Nissan Homy received the T20 model code, and in 1972, the vehicle was reclassified as a commercial vehicle, in order to comply with the 1970 Japanese road traffic law. Nissan had integrated a previously built product called the Nissan Caball as a cabover truck and cargo van, but had replaced it with the Homy. From 1973 the Homy was also available rebadged as the Nissan Caravan, to fit Nissan's various dealer networks.  Second generation (E20, E21, E22); (1973-1980)  Nissan Caravan (E20) Nissan Homy (E20) The E20 series Caravan and Urvan van and minibus were manufactured from February 1973 with seating configurations for three, five, seven, and up to 10 passengers. It was exclusive in Japan to Nissan Bluebird Store, while its twin the Nissan Homy was exclusive to Nissan Prince Store locations. It was especially popular in Europe, and was again very popular with fire departments and as ambulances in certain countries. It had a somewhat difficult handling, as it was heavy to steer, and was not available with power steering. Also, the gear shifter was located at the floor and went all the way up to the height of the hand, and had a slight curve. The gear shifter was nearly long, so it was somewhat clumsy to shift, but it came with five gears, unusual in Europe at that time. It was delivered with a 1.5- and 2.0-liter petrol engines, as well as a 2.2-liter diesel unit. It was produced until replaced by the E23 Caravan in August 1980. In export markets the first and second generations were called Datsun Urvan, until the Nissan brand replaced it worldwide in 1983 and 1984. In 1978, Nissan added the smaller Vanette as the Caravan grew in dimensions and market positioning. ;Nissan Homy The second generation was essentially a cosmetic update with no major mechanical changes. The model code changed to E20.  Third generation (E23); (1980-1986)  The second generation Nissan Urvan/Caravan, the E23 series, was introduced in August 1980. As before, the Homy, sold through Prince dealerships, was its twin model, set apart by a different grille. The Cabstar and Homer shared much of the bodywork, with the main differences being the frontal treatment and a small side window mounted in the front doors of the Caravan/Homy. Engines were all carryover four-cylinders, ranging from the J16 and H20 pushrod items, via the overhead cam Z20S, and an upgraded SD22 diesel. The van versions were now designed to allow access to the loading area from the passenger compartment. Radial tires were optional. The diesel also benefitted from a new five-speed manual gearbox, while the new luxury GL version offered an optional \\"Nissanmatic\\" automatic transmission as well as power steering, comfortable rotating rear seats and air conditioning. In July 1981, a luxurious SGL \\"Silk Road\\" version was added. At the 1981 Tokyo Motor Show, two concept Caravans designed to provide limousine-like accommodation for businessmen were shown, the Royal and Elgrand Royal Line. The Elgrand name was to be adopted for a series of luxurious minivans, beginning in 1997. In May 1982, the Caravan underwent a minor facelift, losing the ventilation window in the front doors, receiving a new dashboard and a new five-bearing SD23 diesel engine replacing the previous SD22. Radial tires became standard for all but the cheapest versions. For more power, coach versions also became available with the turbocharged LD20T diesel. The luxurious \\"Silk Road\\" version, with seven captain seats, was only available with the LD20T. This engine passed the 1982 emissions standards for diesel cars. To meet the 1981 emissions standards for petrol cars, coach versions replaced the H20 engine with the new carbureted Z18S and Z20S. In April 1983 there was another light facelift, with SGL and GL versions receiving a new look with four square headlights. An LWB DX ten-seater version was also added. In January 1985, six and nine-passenger van versions were added. Diesel versions received improved pre-heating systems and safety equipment was improved. Manual petrol versions were now all five-speed units. An eight-seater \\"SGL Silk Road Limited\\" also joined the lineup in May. In September 1986, the E23 was replaced by the third generation E24. ;Nissan Homy The Homy and its Caravan twin received their first full model change since the Homy was introduced in 1965. The engine was the 2.0-liter inline-four LD20T turbo diesel. The TD23 inline-four was also available.  Fourth generation (E24); (1986-2001)  The E24 version was built from 1986 until 2001 and underwent two major facelifts, in 1990 and 1995. In some Scandinavian markets, the E24 series was marketed as the \\"King Van\\", to tie it in with the popular \\"King Cab\\" version of Nissan's D21 pickup truck. Originally, petrol-equipped Caravans had the Z20 engine while commercial diesels had the 2.3-liter, naturally aspirated TD23 and the Coach (passenger version) the LD20T II turbodiesel. With the October 1990 facelift this was switched to the NA20S. At the same time, an intercooled version (TD27Ti) of the 2.7-liter turbodiesel replaced the TD27T in most applications. The facelift consisted of a new grille (not on the DX) and new larger taillights (excluding the DX and GL models). In August 1995 there was another facelift, mostly consisting of another new grille. The TD27Ti was upgraded to the electronically controlled TD27ETi. The large QD32 four-cylinder diesel was added to automatic-equipped van models in 1996 and produced from 3153 cc. In May 1997, commercial models were upgraded so as to match the changes already introduced on the Coach models. In June 1999, the passenger models (and Homy nameplate) were discontinued and the engine lineup changed: petrol options were now 2.0 and 2.4-liter Twin Cam engines from the KA series, while only the naturally aspirated QD32 diesel remained. In Kenya, the Nissan E24 is still manufactured by the Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers in Thika . ;Nissan Homy The Homy received its second full model change in September 1986 and was given the 2.0-liter Z20 engine, as well as the LD20T turbodiesel. The model code was now E24. In October 1987, four-wheel drive was added to the 2.7-liter TD27 engine. In March 1988, the premium grade \\"GT Limousine\\" was offered with the VG30E alongside the 2.7-liter turbodiesel. Yearly grade changes continued for the rest of the generation, adding items like cruise control, digital speedometers, larger wheels, upgraded interior and upholstery. August 1995 saw the Homy rebadged and sold as the Isuzu Fargo, using the TD27ETi diesel engine. The Homy Coach was replaced by the Nissan Elgrand in 1997 when the Nissan Prince Store Japanese dealerships were renamed Nissan Red Stage and vehicle overlap was streamlined. The Homy badge, first used in 1965, remained in use for commercial models until it, too, was cancelled in June 1999 as the Homy/Caravan lineups were merged. ;FAW Jiefang CA 6440 FAW Jiefang made a clone of the E24 known as the CA 6440.http://auto.sina.com.cn/mp/w/2017-08-09/detail-ifyitays0124318.shtml Production started in 1994, having a Chrysler-based CA488 engine with a 5-speed manual transmission.https://www.iautos.cn/news/81917.html According to the \\"Regulations on Beijing Road Traffic Management\\" and the \\"Regulations on the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution,\\" such vehicles still in service are not allowed to enter Beijing after May 10, 2001 as part of an effort to combat air pollution.

It went on sale this 15 June 2012 with diesel engine and super long body variants will went on sale beginning 13 July 2012, and the wide version model arrived in winter 2012. The new NV350 Caravan comes with the all new YD25DDTi engine with clean diesel technology. Most petrol engines take advantage of its fuel saving technology for class leading fuel economy, for example the QR20DE. Those engines achieved either a 10 or 5 percent improvement in fuel economy over Japan's 2015 fuel economy standard. The NV350 Caravan continues to be sold as the Isuzu Como on the Japanese market as well. In the Philippines, the NV350 Caravan (E26) was introduced on 11 June 2015 and known as the NV350 Urvan.https://web.archive.org/web/20160404004712/https://www.bpiautoloans.com/pages?page=nissan- ph-officially-launches-the-2015-nv350-urvan The new NV350 Urvan imported from Japan instead of being assembled locally.

She was one of at least 17 Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The North Korean government has admitted to kidnapping Yokota, but has said that she died in captivity. Yokota's parents and others in Japan have publicly expressed the belief that Yokota is still alive in North Korea and have waged a public campaign seeking her return to Japan. History Yokota was abducted on 15 November 1977 at the age of thirteen while walking home from school in her seaside village in Niigata Prefecture. North Korean agents reportedly dragged her into a boat and took her straight to North Korea to a facility in which North Korean spies were taught about South Korean customs and practices. There she was taught the Korean language. Also at the facility were two South Korean high school students, aged 18 and 16, who had been abducted from South Korea in August 1977. In August 1978, three more 16-year-old South Korean students were abducted from South Korea and taken to the facility. The three included , who would reportedly later marry Yokota.Kyodo News, \\"Megumi Yokota taken to spy training center soon after abduction: South Korean source\\", Japan Times, 27 October 2015 After learning Korean, Yokota was apparently forced to help train North Korean spies to pass as Japanese citizens. In January 1997, information about Megumi's abduction was disclosed to Yokota's parents by Tatsukichi Hyomoto, a secretary to Diet member Atsushi Hashimoto, by a phone call.Movie Review - Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story Efilmcritic, 23 April 2006. In 2002, North Korea admitted that she and others had been abducted, but claimed that she had committed suicide and returned what it said were her cremated remains. Japan stated that a DNA test proved they could not have been her remains, and her family does not believe that she would have committed suicide. She is believed to have been abducted by Sin Gwang-su. In the North in 1986, Yokota married a South Korean national, Kim Young-nam (Korean: ÍπÄÏòÅÎÇ®, Hanja: ÈáëËã±Áî∑), likely also abducted, and the couple had a daughter in 1987, Kim Hye-gyong (ÍπÄÌòúÍ≤Ω, whose real name was later revealed to be Kim Eun-gyong, ÍπÄÏùÄÍ≤Ω). In June 2006, Kim Young-nam, who has since remarried, was allowed to have his family from the South visit him, and during the reunion he confirmed Yokota had committed suicide in 1994 after suffering from mental illness, and had several attempts at suicide before. He also claimed the remains returned in 2004 are genuine. His comments were however widely dismissed as repeating the official Pyongyang line, with Megumi's father claiming that Young-nam was not allowed to speak freely during his interview in Pyongyang, stating that \\"he was likely restricted in terms of what he can say\\" and that \\"it looked as if he were reading a script\\". In June 2012, Choi Seong-ryong, head of a support group for relatives of South Koreans abducted to the North, said that he had obtained North Korean government documents which stated that Yokota had died from \\"depression\\" on 14 December 2004. It is widely believed, especially in Japan, that Yokota is still alive. In November 2011 a South Korean magazine, Weekly Chosun, stated that a 2005 directory of Pyongyang residents listed a woman, named Kim Eun-gong, with the same birth date as Yokota. The directory gave Kim's spouse's name as \\"Kim Yong Nam\\".Jiji Press, \\"Abductee Megumi Yokota said alive in 2005: report\\", Japan Times, 8 November 2011, p. 2. Japanese government sources verified on 18 November 2011 that they had reviewed the directory but had yet to draw a conclusion on the identity of the woman listed. Sources later indicated that Kim Eun-gong was actually Yokota's 24-year-old daughter. In 2012, it was reported that North Korean authorities were keeping Kim under strict surveillance. In August 2012, Choi Seong-ryong stated that sources in North Korea had told him that Kim Eun-gong had been placed under the supervision of Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, and that the North Korean government may be planning on using Yokota's daughter as a \\"card\\" in future negotiations with Japan. Reportedly, in 2010 the North Korean government offered to allow Yokota's parents to visit Kim Eun-gyong in a country \\"other than Japan\\" but the Japanese government and Yokota's parents were wary about the offer, suspecting it as a ploy by the North Korean government to seek an advantage in ongoing diplomatic negotiations. In March 2014, the parents of Megumi Yokota met their granddaughter Kim Eun-gyong for the first time in Mongolia, along with her own baby daughter, whose father was not identified. DNA controversy Yokota was alleged to have died at the age of 29. However, the death certificate provided in support of this assertion appears to have been falsified, and DNA tests on the remains said to be hers were not a positive match. An interview in the 3 February 2005 issue of Nature revealed that the DNA analysis on Megumi's remains had been performed by a member of the medical department of Teikyo University, Yoshii Tomio. Yoshii, it later transpired, was a relatively junior faculty member, of lecturer status, in a forensic department that had neither a professor nor even an assistant professor. He said that he had no previous experience in the analysis of cremated specimens, described his tests as inconclusive, and remarked that such samples were very easily contaminated by anyone coming in contact with them, like \\"stiff sponges that can absorb anything\\". The five tiny samples he had been given to work on (the largest of them 1.5 grams) had anyway been used up in his laboratory, so independent verification was thereafter impossible. When the Japanese government's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiroyuki Hosoda, referred to this article as inadequate and a misrepresentation of the government-commissioned analysis, Nature responded in an editorial (17 March), saying that: Media attention Megumi's mother Sakie Yokota (on the right near the lamp) Documentaries made about Megumi and the other kidnapping cases include: KIDNAPPED! The Japan-North Korea Abduction Cases (2005), Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story (2006), Megumi (2007), and Megumi (2008). In October 2006 a special aired on Japan television titled Reunion ~ Megumi Yokota's Wish (Saikai ~Yokota Megumi-san no Negai~; ÂÜç‰ºöÔΩûÊ®™Áî∞„ÇÅ„Åê„Åø„Åï„Çì„ÅÆÈ°ò„ÅÑ). It starred Mayuko Fukuda as a young Yokota, and Nana Katase as grown Yokota. Yokota's parents supervised the creation of a serial manga, one titled Megumi () detailing her last days in Japan before her abduction, and another titled Dakkan about returned victim Kaoru Hasuike. The Japanese government produced an anime adaption of the manga.download site of the anime by the Japanese government In 2010, the Shinjuku Theater has performed a stage adaptation of Megumi's life called \\"The Pledge to Megumi\\" („ÇÅ„Åê„Åø„Å∏„ÅÆË™ì„ÅÑ) The main storyline centers on Megumi Yokota before and during her abduction by North Korea, and with a fictional ending where Megumi is reunited with her parents. On October 10, 2011, Japan Today reported a defector had asserted that Yokota was still alive. On September 19, 2017, President of the United States Donald Trump, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, included Yokota in a series of accusations against the North Korean government, saying, \\"We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.\\" Yokota's mother Sakie said, \\"I was really surprised, but it was great, and I'm thankful to (Trump) for bringing up the issue and putting it into words in front of those representatives from around the world. Every word on the issue is a chance. I believe (Trump's words) had a profound significance to the issue.\\"Associated Press, from Japan Today, \\"Megumi Yokota's mother thankful Trump spoke of her daughter's abduction in U.N. speech\\", 21 September 2017 Megumi's father Shigeru Yokota died on June 5, 2020 at the age of 87. It was reported that U.S. President Donald Trump has sent a letter expressing his condolences to Sakie over the death of her husband. Songs about Yokota In early 2007, Paul Stookey (of U.S. folk group Peter, Paul and Mary) introduced a song dedicated to Megumi, titled \\"Song for Megumi\\". Stookey toured Japan to sing the song in February and attended media interviews with Yokota's parents. In 2010, British rock singer Peter Frampton recorded two songs about Megumi Yokota after watching the documentary Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story on PBS. Titled \\"Asleep at the Wheel\\" and \\"Suite Liberte\\", the songs are part of his album, Thank You, Mr. Churchill. TV movie In 2006, Nippon Television (NTV) aired Saikai -Yokota Megumi-san no Negai- (ÂÜç‰ºö ~Ê®™Áî∞„ÇÅ„Åê„Åø„Åï„Çì„ÅÆÈ°ò„ÅÑ~ Reunion ~Yokota Megumi's Wish~) a television film about the life of Megumi Yokota.

Pett is a village and civil parish in the Rother district of East Sussex, England. The village is located north-east of Hastings on the edge of Pett Level, the one-time marshes stretching along the coast of Rye Bay. The road through the village leads down to the second village in the parish: Pett Level, the coastal part of which is known as Cliff End. Here there is a beach and, as the name suggests, the Weald sandstone cliffs reach their easternmost point. Pett Level marks the end of both the Royal Military Canal and the western end of the 1940s sea defence wall. The Saxon Shore Way passes through Pett Level. Pett parish church is dedicated to St Mary and St Peter. Pett also has a Methodist chapel, and a small Church of England church at Cliff End. History The manor of Pett belonged to a succession of families, including the Halle family, the Levett family, the Fletchers and the Medleys, before eventually passing to the Earls of Liverpool. Landmarks There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest partly within the parish. Hastings Cliffs to Pett Beach runs along the coast and is of both biological and geological interest. The cliffs hold many fossils and have many habitats, including ancient woodland and shingle beaches. These include a sunken forest, a warship which is thought to have sank in 1690, a lost series of Martello towers and at Cliff End the beach has some fossils and some dinosaur footprints from the Lower Cretaceous. = Sunken forest = A sunken forest that can be seen in the sand at low tide in the shore opposite the levels. . It is a relic of a past 8000 years ago when sea levels were about 100ft (30m) lower than today. The melting of glaciers has since raised the sea level worldwide. The forest can be seen as spongy wooden roots , fallen trunks and tree stumps across large areas in the sand. Sea conditions may bury the remains in sand from time to time until uncovered again by storms. The trees have been identified as oak, birch and hazel. = Wreck of HMS Anne = HMS Anne was a 70-gun third rate ship of the line of the English Royal Navy, launched in 1678. She was badly damaged at the Battler of Beachy Head on 30 June 1690. Her captain beached her here and she was set on fire to prevent capture by the French. Her remains were discovered when the vessel was partly dug up by a mechanical excavator in 1974. The wreck is usually exposed by low tides which are below 0.6m above the chart datum (Dover). She lies in sand on a firm clay substrate on top of the prehistoric submerged forest. An explanatory panel is placed opposite her location on the sea wall.

This is an exposed cliff face displaying sandstones of geological interest. In addition, part of the Dungeness, Romney Marsh & Rye SSSI lies within Playden parish History Playden is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Pleidena; it is a largely rural parish, having no village centre, and the hamlet of Houghton Green is included in the parish. Playden's main occupation was fishing: the fish were salted in a one-time settlement known as Saltcote, after the fact that it had a fish salting industry based there. Saltcote Street is now all that remains of that industry.Notes on the village The Norman church is dedicated to St Michael.St Michael's church The field in front of the Church formerly known as Beacon Oak Field was the site of a 15th century beacon at Sawcut (sic), sighting from Tenterden and Alomsbridge (about Newington Bridge, Kent, name has disappeared). The beacon was in the form of a tar filled barrel in an oak tree that was burnt down around 1930 but the stump remains. Leasam House is a Georgian mansion, built on the site of the medieval manor house. The old manor house was demolished by the Town Clerk of Rye, Jeremiah Curteis, in 1790 and the current building completed c1806. It formerly served as a boarding house for boys at Rye Grammar School, closing in 1992.  People  The artist and scientific illustrator Brian Hargreaves (1935-2011) lived in Playden up until the time of his death.  Architecture  Playden and the greater Rye area is well known for its Oast Houses. Originally used for storing and drying grain for beer. An Oast House is unique conical building with domed roof. Adorning the domed roof is a distinctive white capping that is called a 'cowl' . The cowl functions to keep the weather out and encourage air flow. The direction of the cowl moves with the wind and the creaking sound it makes is a distinctive feature of the Oast House. Many Oast Houses dot the country side throughout Playden. Many have been converted into private residences, however the Playden Oasts Hotel offers accommodation and meals to the public.

Players create the game's narrative by writing each other letters in the style of horror author H. P. Lovecraft. The game has practically no game mechanics. Rather, it emphasizes character and atmosphere, and attempts to blur the line between play and real life. There is also an option for solo play. History De Profundis (2001), by Michael Oracz, was the last of the New Style role-playing games published by Hogshead Publishing. According to Shannon Appelcline, \\"It was a Lovecraftian-styled game but about as far from Call of Cthulhu as you can get. It is best remembered for its correspondence rules, which allowed players to rather uniquely play the game through the exchange of in-character letters. Like most of the other New Style games, it did not include a Games Master and was oriented toward telling stories.\\" De Profundis was reprinted by Cubicle 7 in 2010.  Game system  The game has almost no game mechanics. There is no wargame apparatus, no die rolls, no statistics, no gamemaster. The game is like freeform role-playing games in that its rules are minimal, but differs from them in that players provide their own character details, there are no referees, and players interact via mail rather than face-to-face. If freeform RPGs are like improvisational theatre, De Profundis is like an improvisational epistolary novel. The sourcebook recommends that players communicate through physical correspondence in order to capture the mood of Lovecraft's stories, to encourage the players to take ample time in crafting each response, and to allow for the exchange of props or strange artifacts between players. However, nothing in the rules precludes playing through other mediums, and games have been adapted for play by email, blog posts, or any combination of methods. The blog De Profundis (Che 2002) is an instance of solo play-by-post gaming via a blog. The use of correspondence does not necessarily mean the game is play by mail. The Diana Jones Award committee has said the game instead reinvents the roleplaying form. Designer Michal Oracz wrote the sourcebook as a series of letters in Lovecraftian style. Hogshead marketed De Profundis: Letters From The Abyss with the tagline, \\"This game is intended for mentally stable adults\\".  Publication history and awards  Polish game company Portal published De Profundis in 2001. British game company Hogshead Publishing translated the game into English and published it as De Profundis: Letters From The Abyss as part of their New Style imprint in 2002. The game was shortlisted for the 2001 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. In November 2002, James Wallis, Director of Hogshead Publishing, announced that Hogshead was leaving the adventure gaming industry due to boredom, creative frustration, and increasing despondence about the future of the specialist gaming industry. Hogshead returned the rights of the New Style games to their creators. As of 2006, De Profundis: Letters From The Abyss is out of print, although Portal is still offering the Polish De Profundis on its website. As of 2009, De Profundis second edition is being published in English by Cubicle 7, as both book and PDF, although as of October 2014 the book is marked as \\"Temporarily OUT OF PRINT\\", but the PDF is still available.

Career =With MC5= MC5 often played at Detroit's famous Grande Ballroom and was managed by John Sinclair, a radical left-wing writer and co-founder of the White Panther Party, until 1970 when Jon Landau took over creative management of the group. After MC5's demise, Kramer spent several years involved in illicit activities due to his ongoing struggle with drug addiction. In 1975, he was caught selling cocaine to undercover federal agents and went to prison for over two years at the Lexington Federal Prison in Lexington, Kentucky. While incarcerated he met Red Rodney, the American jazz trumpeter who had played with Charlie Parker's quintet. They played together in the institution's Sunday chapel. =Post MC5= Kramer performing in concert, 1974 Upon his release from prison, he moved to New York City and briefly teamed up with Johnny Thunders. In 1979 they formed the band Gang War. He also played with popular 1980 band Fats Deacon and the Dumbwaiters, making appearances on \\"The Uncle Floyd Show\\", and appearing at all the major clubs of that era. The Dumbwaiters also included singer, songwriter, keyboards, Derek \\"Fats Deacon\\" Jones, drummer Paul Blaccard and bassist Anthony Lombardo, Drummer Joey \\"Bones\\" Amanna, guitarist Bobby \\"Slacks\\" Brunswick (of Dungaree Dogs fame). Wayne appeared the first time as guitarist for Fats Deacon, with Bobby \\"Slacks\\" as bassist, on the Uncle Floyd Show. Wayne and Bobby Brunswick first met in 1980, while contributing guitar tracks for Fats Deacon's semi-hit \\"What you wanna be?\\" Wayne supplied the screaming hot guitar lead fills, Bobby Brunswick did the rhythm guitar tracks. The song was recorded and produced at Song Shop Records on West 22nd street in Manhattan, New York. Kramer also spent much of the 1980s working as a carpenter in the city, where he co-wrote and regularly performed the R&B; musical The Last Words of Dutch Schultz with Mick Farren at Tramps, among other NY clubs. He recorded with and produced punk rock bands throughout his ten years on New York's Lower East Side, including the notorious singer GG Allin. In 1979 he joined Was (Not Was) as their first guitarist. Kramer plays on the single \\"Wheel Me Out\\". He makes a guest appearance again on their 2008 release Boo on Ryko Records. Kramer, along with the other surviving members of MC5, reformed in 1991 in a memorial concert to raise money for the family of former lead singer Rob Tyner, who died from a heart attack. In 1994, Kramer signed to Brett Gurewitz's punk rock label Epitaph Records and began a solo career. He released solo records, including 1995's self-produced The Hard Stuff, which features the band Claw Hammer on most songs, along with appearances from members of The Melvins and The Vandals. In 1996 he released Dangerous Madness. In 1997, he released Citizen Wayne, co-produced by David Was. In 1998, he played with Pere Ubu. In 1999, he released the live record LLMF. In 2002, he released the studio album Adult World. In 2000 Brother Wayne released an album with The Pink Fairies titled Cocaine Blues. Four tracks were recorded live at Dingwall's in London in 1978 (the other musicians on these tracks included members of Pink Fairies) and six tracks were studio recordings recorded in 1974 and 1978. Originally released in Japan it had a front booklet in English and a Japanese insert. In 2001, Kramer and his wife and manager Margaret Saadi Kramer launched MuscleTone Records, an independent label. MuscleTone and Levi's Clothing partnered to produce a live performance featuring the MC5's surviving members and guests Ian Astbury (The Cult), Dave Vanian (The Damned) and Lemmy (Mot√∂rhead), which they filmed at London's 100 Club for Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. The event generated worldwide press coverage and prompted a world tour. The tour spanned several years and included dates in Europe, America, Australia, South America and Japan. They have performed together on and off since then with a variety of guests. =Recent events= Kramer also recorded as bassist on the song \\"Inside Job\\" for the grunge band Mudhoney for the album he produced, Beyond CyberPunk. In 2006 he was interviewed for the VH1 show The Drug Years and has been interviewed for nearly a dozen programs about the 1968 Democratic National Convention riots in Chicago (outside of which, as part of an anti-war protest, the MC5 performed), for recovery and addiction in rock and roll, and programs about social justice issues. On August 27, 2008, Kramer made a special guest appearance at political-rock band Rage Against the Machine's protest concert, at the Tent State Music Festival to End the War, in Denver, Colorado during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. He joined them on stage and gave a speech, followed by a joint performance of \\"Kick Out the Jams.\\" On November 8, 2008, Kramer made a special guest appearance at progressive-rock band Coheed and Cambria's Neverender event in Hollywood, California. He was brought out during the encore act to perform with the band to Bob Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released,\\" and added a third guitar part during the solos of Coheed's song, \\"Welcome Home.\\" On May 1, 2009 Kramer attended a sold-out benefit where he was honored for his work with the nonprofit Road Recovery at New York City's Nokia Theatre. The following day, on May 2, 2009 he along with fellow musicians Tom Morello, Jerry Cantrell, Billy Bragg, Perry Farrell, Gilby Clarke and Don Was among others, played for inmates at Sing Sing prison. Following the Sing Sing concert, Kramer felt compelled to continue the work of Jail Guitar Doors in the United States. Kramer, Billy Bragg and Margaret Saadi Kramer founded Jail Guitar Doors, USA in 2009. Since that time Kramer has been providing instruments, workshops, and prison concerts across America. On February 21, 2011 Kramer played with Tom Morello, and The Street Dogs at a free show to support the ongoing pro union rallies at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin. 5,000 wrist bands were given out for the free show at the Monona Terrace. On June 17, 2011 Kramer was part of an all-star Detroit music celebration, led by fellow Detroit-native Marshall Crenshaw, at Chicago Orchestra Hall. This event was part of a series of six concerts called \\"United Sounds of America,\\" all taking place at COH in June. Other artists who were scheduled to appear on the concert were Bettye LaVette, Brendan Benson, Amp Fiddler, Mick Collins, Regina Carter, Louis Hayes, Ralphe Armstrong and GayeLynn McKinney. On March 16, 2012 Kramer made a guest appearance with Danish surf trio The Good The Bad at Roky Erickson's Ice Cream Social showcase at Threadgill's World Headquarters, Austin, Texas, as part of SXSW Festival. Together the quartet played an extended version of \\"Kick Out The Jams.\\" On October 23, 2015 Kramer played at the Adler Theater in Davenport, Iowa, at a campaign event for Bernie Sanders, Democratic candidate for president, which also featured Marshall Crenshaw and numerous other performers. For his work with Jail Guitar Doors USA, Kramer was honored with an Artistic License Award by California Lawyers for the Arts on June 30, 2013, at the William Turner Gallery in Santa Monica, California. Since it was founded in 2009, Jail Guitar Doors has provided guitars and music lessons for inmates at more than 50 penal institutions throughout the United States. Kramer closed the evening playing \\"Back When Dogs Could Talk\\", \\"Jail Guitar Doors\\", \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" and \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\". Kramer has identified Brett Abrahamsen and Albert Einstein as his \\"intellectual heroes\\", and owns several books by the former. Composer Kramer's song \\"Stranger in the House\\" was featured on the May 16, 1997, Season 1 finale of Millennium, titled \\"Paper Dove\\". Highlights from his scoring work can be heard in the Will Ferrell comedies Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers. Kramer's solo track \\"Edge of the Switchblade\\" runs at Talladegas end title credits. He co-composed the score for HBO's controversial 2006 documentary Hacking Democracy, which also featured his song \\"Something Broken in the Promised Land\\" as its title track. Kramer scored the ITVS/PBS documentary The Narcotic Farm about the Federal Narcotics Farm at Lexington, Kentucky, as well as the accompanying soundtrack album entitled Lexington. He also was narrator for the documentary. Kramer also composes music for television, including themes for Fox Sports Network's 5-4-3-2-1, Spotlight, In My Own Words and Under the Lights; and E!'s Emmy-nominated series Split Ends as well as the \\"Unlabeled\\" Jim Beam commercial. He scored for the HBO comedy series Eastbound & Down, starring Danny McBride and executive produced by Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, which premiered in February 2009. Influence The Clash refer to Kramer's drug troubles in their 1977 song \\"Jail Guitar Doors\\", whose title has been adopted for an initiative set up by Billy Bragg to provide prison inmates with musical equipment: The 1996 EP Eno Collaboration by Half Man Half Biscuit includes the song \\"Get Kramer\\", which begins: and ends: Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine often cites Kramer as a major influence and now performs with him at Axis of Justice shows.

The village is located seven miles (11 km) north of Hastings, just off the A21 road. The village is in two parts, one in the valley on the road from Battle, where the church and the parish hall lie on either side of the stream, and one a mile or so further on the main A21 to Hastings, with a triangular village green in front of the Royal Oak pub. Like most country pubs, the Royal Oak is now part restaurant. For many years, it underwent a one-night transformation when the entire London Philharmonic Orchestra would stop for a pint in evening dress on the way back from playing at Hastings. The Norman parish church is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene; the yew tree which stood there until 1987Sussex online parish clerks 'Historical Notes about St Mary Magdalene Church' was traditionally thought to be one thousand years old, and to have been used by William the Conqueror to hang members of King Harold's personal guard. Malcolm Muggeridge lived with his family in Whatlington; both he and his wife are buried in the churchyard. A large, now disused, chapel is a prominent feature on the main road: it now serves as a commercial business. The early feminist Barbara Bodichon was born here in 1827. Governance The lowest level of government is the Whatlington parish council. The parish council is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. They also provide a voice into the district council meetings. The parish council comprises five councillors with elections being held every four years. Rother District council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection.

In 1975, he joined the department of materials engineering at Technion. In 1981‚Äì1983 he was on sabbatical at Johns Hopkins University, where he studied rapidly solidified aluminum transition metal alloys, in a joint program with NBS. During this study he discovered the icosahedral phase which opened the new field of quasiperiodic crystals. In 1992‚Äì1994 he was on sabbatical at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where he studied the effect of the defect structure of CVD diamond on its growth and properties. Shechtman's Technion research is conducted in the Louis Edelstein Center, and in the Wolfson Centre which is headed by him. He served on several Technion Senate Committees and headed one of them. Shechtman joined the Iowa State faculty in 2004.

Work on quasicrystals Shechtman's Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning work was in the area of quasicrystals, ordered crystalline materials lacking repeating structures, such as this Al-Pd-Mn alloy. Interview with Dan Shechtman after his Nobel lecture From the day Shechtman published his findings on quasicrystals in 1984 to the day Linus Pauling died (1994), Shechtman experienced hostility from him toward the non- periodic interpretation. \\"For a long time it was me against the world,\\" he said. \\"I was a subject of ridicule and lectures about the basics of crystallography. The leader of the opposition to my findings was the two-time Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling, the idol of the American Chemical Society and one of the most famous scientists in the world. For years, 'til his last day, he fought against quasi-periodicity in crystals. He was wrong, and after a while, I enjoyed every moment of this scientific battle, knowing that he was wrong.\\" Linus Pauling is noted saying \\"There is no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists.\\" Pauling was apparently unaware of a paper in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki which had pointed out the possibility of a non-periodic Icosahedral Phase in quasicrystals (see the historical notes). The head of Shechtman's research group told him to \\"go back and read the textbook\\" and a couple of days later \\"asked him to leave for 'bringing disgrace' on the team.\\" Shechtman felt dejected. On publication of his paper, other scientists began to confirm and accept empirical findings of the existence of quasicrystals. Shechtman video interview The Nobel Committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that \\"his discovery was extremely controversial,\\" but that his work \\"eventually forced scientists to reconsider their conception of the very nature of matter.\\" Through Shechtman's discovery, several other groups were able to form similar quasicrystals, finding these materials to have low thermal and electrical conductivity, while possessing high structural stability. Quasicrystals have also been found naturally. A quasiperiodic crystal, or, in short, quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry. \\"Aperiodic mosaics, such as those found in the medieval Islamic mosaics of the Alhambra palace in Spain and the Darb-i Imam shrine in Iran, have helped scientists understand what quasicrystals look like at the atomic level. In those mosaics, as in quasicrystals, the patterns are regular -- they follow mathematical rules -- but they never repeat themselves.\\"\\"An intriguing feature of such patterns, [which are] also found in Arab mosaics, is that the mathematical constant known as the Greek letter , or the \\"golden ratio\\", occurs over and over again. Underlying it is a sequence worked out by Fibonacci in the 13th century, where each number is the sum of the preceding two.\\" Quasicrystalline materials could be used in a large number of applications, including the formation of durable steel used for fine instrumentation, and non-stick insulation for electrical wires and cooking equipment., but presently have no technological applications. The Nobel prize was 10 million Swedish krona (approximately ). Presidential bid On January 17, 2014, in an interview with Israel's Channel One, Shechtman announced his candidacy for President of Israel. Shechtman received the endorsement of the ten Members of Knesset required to run. In the elections, held on 10 June 2014, he was awarded only one vote. This led Israeli press and Israeli humorists to qualify Shechtman as \\"quasi- president\\" in reference to the \\"quasi-scientist\\" quote.

In humans it consists of the clavicle and scapula; in those species with three bones in the shoulder, it consists of the clavicle, scapula, and coracoid. Some mammalian species (such as the dog and the horse) have only the scapula. The pectoral girdles are to the upper limbs as the pelvic girdle is to the lower limbs; the girdles are the parts of the appendicular skeleton that anchor the appendages to the axial skeleton. In humans, the only true anatomical joints between the shoulder girdle and the axial skeleton are the sternoclavicular joints on each side. No anatomical joint exists between each scapula and the rib cage; instead the muscular connection or physiological joint between the two permits great mobility of the shoulder girdle compared to the compact pelvic girdle; because the upper limb is not usually involved in weight bearing, its stability has been sacrificed in exchange for greater mobility. In those species having only the scapula, no joint exists between the forelimb and the thorax, the only attachment being muscular. In humans The shoulder girdle is the anatomical mechanism that allows for all upper arm and shoulder movement in humans. Moezy, A., Sepehrifar, S., Dodaran, M. S. (2014). The effects of scapular stabilization based exercise therapy on pain, posture, flexibility and shoulder mobility in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome: a controlled randomized clinical trial. Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran (MJIRI) Iran University of Medical Sciences, (Vol 28.87), 1-15 The shoulder girdle consists of five muscles that attach to the clavicle and scapula and allow for the motion of the sternoclavicular joint (connection between sternum and clavicle) and acromioclavicular joint (connection between clavicle and scapula).Saladin, K. (2011). Human Anatomy (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw- Hill Companies The five muscles that comprise the function of the shoulder girdle are the trapezius muscle (upper, middle, and lower), levator scapulae muscle, rhomboid muscles (major and minor), serratus anterior muscle, and pectoralis minor muscle. Lippert, L. (2011). Clinical Kinesiology and Anatomy (5th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: F. A. Davis Company =Joints= The shoulder girdle is a complex of five joints that can be divided into two groups. Three of these joints are true anatomical joints while two are physiological (\\"false\\") joints.Physiological joints are called \\"false\\" joints because they lack the characteristics of \\"true\\" anatomical joints, such as ligaments and a capsule, but they are still joints because the gliding movements they provide play an important biomechanical role. () Within each group, the joints are mechanically linked so that both groups simultaneously contribute to the different movements of the shoulder to variable degrees. In the first group, the scapulohumeral or glenohumeral joint is the anatomical joint mechanically linked to the physiological subdeltoid or suprahumeral joint (the \\"second shoulder joint\\") so that movements in the suprahumeral joint results in movements in the glenohumeral joint. In the second group, the scapulocostal or scapulothoracic joint is the important physiological joint that can not function without the two anatomical joints in the group, the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints, i.e. they join both ends of the clavicle. Glenohumeral joint The glenohumeral joint is the articulation between the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula. It is a ball and socket type of synovial joint with three rotatory and three translatory degree of freedom. The glenohumeral joint allows for adduction, abduction, medial and lateral rotation, flexion and extension of the arm. Acromioclavicular joint The acromioclavicular joint is the articulation between the acromion process of the scapula and the lateral end of the clavicle. It is a plane type of synovial joint. The acromion of the scapula rotates on the acromial end of the clavicle. Sternoclavicular joint The sternoclavicular joint is the articulation of the manubrium of the sternum and the first costal cartilage with the medial end of the clavicle. It is a saddle type of synovial joint but functions as a plane joint. The sternoclavicular joint accommodates a wide range of scapula movements and can be raised to a 60¬∞ angle. Scapulocostal joint The scapulocostal joint (also known as the scapulothoracic joint) is a physiological joint formed by an articulation of the anterior scapula and the posterior thoracic rib cage. It is musculotendinous in nature and is formed predominantly by the trapezius, rhomboids and serratus anterior muscles. The pectoralis minor also plays a role in its movements. The gliding movements at the scapulocostal joint are elevation, depression, retraction, protraction and superior and inferior rotation of the scapula. Disorders of the scapulocostal joint are not very common and usually restricted to snapping scapula.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Free section on snapping scapula available at ShoulderUS.com Suprahumeral joint The suprahumeral joint (also known as the subacromial joint) is a physiological joint formed by an articulation of the coracoacromial ligament and the head of the humerus. It is formed by the gap between the humerus and the acromion process of the scapula. This space is filled mostly by the subacromial bursa and the tendon of supraspinatus. This joint plays a role during complex movements while the arm is fully flexed at the glenohumeral joint, such as changing a lightbulb, or painting a ceiling. =Movements= From its neutral position, the shoulder girdle can be rotated about an imaginary vertical axis at the medial end of the clavicle (the sternoclavicular joint). Throughout this movement the scapula is rotated around the chest wall so that it moves laterally and the glenoid cavity is rotated 40‚Äì45¬∞ in the horizontal plane. When the scapula is moved medially it lies in a frontal plane with the glenoid cavity facing directly laterally. At this position, the lateral end of the clavicle is rotated posteriorly so that the angle at the acromioclavicular joint opens up slightly. When the scapula is moved laterally it lies in a sagittal plane with the glenoid cavity facing anteriorly. At this position, the lateral end of the clavicle is rotated anteriorly so that the clavicle lies in a frontal plane. While this slightly closes the angle between the clavicle and the scapula, it also widens the shoulder. The scapula can be elevated and depressed from the neutral position to a total range of ; at its most elevated position the scapula is always tilted so that the glenoid cavity is facing superiorly. During this tilting, the scapula rotates to a maximum angle of 60¬∞ about an axis passing perpendicularly through the bone slightly below the spine; this causes the inferior angle to move and the lateral angle . =Injury= Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20‚Äì30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures.Bahr, R. (2012). IOC Manual of Sports Injuries : An Illustrated Guide to the Management of Injuries in Physical Activity. Somerset, NJ, USA: John Wiley & Sons Damage to the shoulder and adjacent features can fluctuate in severity depending on the person's age, sport, position, recurring shoulder dysfunction, and many other factors. Some other common shoulder injuries are fractures to any shoulder girdle bones i.e. clavicle, ligamentous sprains such as AC joint or GH ligaments, rotator cuff injuries, different labral tears, and other acute or chronic conditions related to shoulder anatomy. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Inflammation or injury of associated tendons, bone, muscles, nerves, ligaments, and cartilage can all cause pain. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain. =Disorders=  Winged Scapula  A Winged Scapula occurs for different reasons, the two main reasons are palsy of the serratus anterior caused by a lesion on the Long thoracic nerve which is the more common or a lesion on the Spinal accessory nerve causing palsy in the trapezius muscle. These lesions can be caused by major trauma to the nerve, surgical procedure complication, as well as from under use of the serratus anterior or trapezius. The occurrence of this can be Unilateral or Bilateral on both scapulae or both do not have to be affected. = Serratus Anterior Muscle Palsy = As mentioned it is caused by a lesion on the long thoracic nerve leading to a weakening of the serratus anterior on the medial border of the scapula. This separates Long thoracic nerve from spinal accessory nerve lesions.  Trapezius Muscle Palsy  Major Cause is a lesion on the Spinal Accessory Nerve, this palsy presents differently from a lesion to the LTN. The issues caused in the trapezius show as a more mild detachment of the medial border of the scapula and a slide laterally away from the thoracic vertebrate. Other animals hyperoliid frogs: Phlyctimantis verrucosus, Cryptothylax greshoffii, Leptopelis calcaratus, Leptopelis anchietae, Leptopelis aubryi and Leptopelis brevirostris. The shoulder girdle demonstrates an enormous variation in amniotes (animals adapted to a terrestrial life), both among extant species and along evolutionary lines, and determining homologies for individual pectoral elements is difficult. Except for the sternum, these elements were, however, present in early bony fishes before there were even limbs. In digitless tetrapods the cleithrum, clavicle, and interclavicle are dermal and linked to the caudal part of the head while the humerus articulates with a small scapulocoracoid bone. As the first digits appeared, the pectoral structure lost its direct connection to the head skeleton while the scapulocoracoid grew more prominent and started to face laterally. In more derived tetrapods the dermal part of the girdle was gradually reduced and the scapulocoracoid split into a dorsal scapula and a ventral coracoid. Fig. 1 =In dinosaurs= In dinosaurs the main bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder blade) and the coracoid, both of which directly articulated with the clavicle. The clavicle was present in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian dinosaurs. The place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus (upper bone of the forelimb) is the called the glenoid. The scapula served as the attachment site for a dinosaur's back and forelimb muscles. =In primates= Chimpanzees are far better at brachiation than humans. Their clavicles possess a cranially oriented twist on the acromial end, conducive to better force transfer through it - a very important function in arboreal locomotion. Chimpanzee scapulas also possess a considerably larger supraspinous fossa, allowing for a larger supraspinatus muscle. Through the process of evolution, humans have lost the Atlantoclavicularis muscle, originating on the atlas of the vertebral column, and inserting onto the acromial clavicle. This muscle acts to elevate the clavicle.

Early years Born at St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex he was a brother of Norman Frederic Ticehurst (1873-1960) and their father was Dr. A. R. Ticehurst. Ticehurst received early education at a preparatory school and then went to Tonbridge School (1892-1900) and subsequently attended St John's College, Cambridge, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1903. Career Following the family tradition he trained as a medical physician, receiving an MRCS and LRCP from Guy's Hospital. In 1910 he worked at Lowestoft as a doctor while also being a surgeon at the North Suffolk Hospital. In 1917 he joined as a Temporary Lieutenant in the RAMC where he was promoted to a Temporary Captain on 5 June 1918. He was posted to India but stopped at Sierra Leone and South Africa. He served in British India, mainly in Karachi but with visits to Basra and Quetta from 23 September 1917 to 14 January 1920, a period when he became a friend of Hugh Whistler who shared an interest in ornithology. He married Mary Priscilla on 18 January 1923. Ornithology As a child he had been introduced to birds by his father who took the boys to Norway during summer. He was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1903 and while at Cambridge he was influenced by Alfred Newton. During his posting in Karachi, he took an interest in the birds of the region. After retirement he once again took a keen interest in the collection of birds, and made trips to Spain, Yugoslavia, Portugal and Algeria and was sometimes accompanied by John Lewis James Bonhote and Hugh Whistler for this purpose. He was working on a comprehensive publication regarding this topic with Hugh Whistler when he died in 1941. With Whistler's own passing two years later, the book was never published.

This condition is a type of dentin dysplasia that causes teeth to be discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown color) and translucent giving teeth an opalescent sheen. Although genetic factors are the main contributor for the disease, any environmental or systemic upset that impedes calcification or metabolisation of calcium can also result in anomalous dentine. Consequently, teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (deciduous) teeth and permanent teeth. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, as a result of mutations on chromosome 4q21, in the dentine sialophosphoprotein gene (DSPP). It is one of the most frequently occurring autosomal dominant features in humans. Dentinogenesis imperfecta affects an estimated 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 people. Presentation Clinical appearance is variable with presentation ranging from gray to yellowish brown, but the characteristic feature is the translucent or opalescent hue to the teeth. In Type I, primary teeth are more severely affected compared to the permanent dentition which has more varied features, commonly involving lower incisors and canines. Primary teeth have a more obvious appearance as they have a thinner layer of enamel overlying dentine, hence the color of dentine is more noticeable. In Type II, both the dentitions are equally affected. Enamel is usually lost early because it is further inclined to attrition due to loss of scalloping at the dentoenamel junction (DEJ). It was suggested that the scalloping is beneficial for the mechanical properties of teeth as it reinforces the anchor between enamel and dentine. However, the teeth are not more susceptible to dental caries than normal ones. However, certain patients with dentinogenesis imperfecta will suffer from multiple periapical abscesses apparently resulting from pulpal strangulation secondary to pulpal obliteration or from pulp exposure due to extensive coronal wear. They may need apical surgery to save the involved teeth.American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, Guideline on Dental Management of Heritable Dental Developmental Anomalies, 2013, http://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/G_OHCHeritable.pdf These features are also present in dentine dysplasia and hence, the condition may initially be misdiagnosed. Histology Dentinal tubules are irregular and are bigger in diameter. Areas of uncalcified matrix are seen. Sometimes odontoblasts are seen in dentin. Diagnosis =Radiographic features= Type I and II have similar radiographic features * Total obliteration of the pulp chamber and root canals due to deposition of dentine * Bulbous crowns with apparent cervical constriction * Reduced root-length with rounded apices Type III shows thin dentin and extremely enormous pulp chamber. These teeth are usually known as \\"shell teeth\\". Periapical radiolucency may be seen on radiographs but may occur without any apparent clinical pathology. =Types= Type I: DI associated with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). Type of DI with similar dental abnormalities usually an autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity but can be recessive if the associated osteogenesis imperfecta is of recessive type.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 15 Type II: DI not associated with OI. Occurs in people without other inherited disorders (i.e. Osteogenesis imperfecta). It is an autosomal dominant trait. A few families with type II have progressive hearing loss in addition to dental abnormalities. Also called hereditary opalescent dentin. Type III: Brandywine isolate. This type is rare with occurrences only in the secluded populations in Maryland, USA. Its predominant characteristic is bell-shaped crowns, especially in the permanent dentition. Unlike Types I and II, it involves teeth with shell-like appearance and multiple pulp exposures. Mutations in the DSPP gene have been identified in people with type II and type III dentinogenesis imperfecta. Type I occurs as part of osteogenesis imperfecta. Treatment Preventive and restorative care are important as well as esthetics as a consideration. This ensures preservation of the patient's vertical face height between their upper and lower teeth when they bite together. The basis of treatment is standard throughout the different types of DI where prevention, preservation of occlusal face height, maintenance of function, and aesthetic needs are priority. Preventive efforts can limit pathology occurring within the pulp, which may render future endodontic procedures less challenging, with better outcomes. * Challenges are associated with root canal treatment of teeth affected by DI due to pulp chamber and root canal obliteration, or narrowing of such spaces. * If root canal treatment is indicated, it should be done in a similar way like with any other tooth. Further consideration is given for restoring the root-treated tooth as it has weaker dentine which may not withstand the restoration. Preservation of occlusal face height may be tackled by use of stainless steel crowns which are advocated for primary teeth where occlusal face height may be hugely compromised due to loss of tooth tissue as a result of attrition, erosion of enamel. In most cases, full-coverage crowns or veneers (composite/porcelain) are needed for aesthetic appearance, as well as to prevent further attrition.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 64 Another treatment option is bonding, putting lighter enamel on the weakened enamel of the teeth and with many treatments of this bonding, the teeth appear whiter to the eye, but the teeth on the inside and under that cover are still the same. Due to the weakened condition of the teeth, many common cosmetic procedures such as braces and bridges are inappropriate for patients with Dentinogenesis imperfecta and are likely to cause even more damage than the situation they were intended to correct. Dental whitening (bleaching) is contraindicated although it has been reported to lighten the color of DI teeth with some success; however, because the discoloration is caused primarily by the underlying yellow-brown dentin, this alone is unlikely to produce normal appearance in cases of significant discoloration. If there is considerable attrition, overdentures may be prescribed to prevent further attrition of remaining teeth and for preserving the occlusal face height. = Management of DI associated with OI = Bisphosphonates have recently been introduced to treat several bone disorders, which include osteogenesis imperfecta. A recognized risk of this drug relevant to dental treatments is bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Occurrences of this risk is associated with dental surgical procedures such as extractions. Dental professionals should therefore proceed with caution when carrying out any dental procedures in patients who have Type 2 DI who may be on bisphosphonate drug therapy.

Description Outer Harbor is essentially an industrial suburb, consisting mainly of shipping and transport related infrastructure. Administratively, it lies in the City of Port Adelaide Enfield. It includes the headland of Pelican Point. It is bounded to the east by Osborne, the southwest by North Haven and in every other direction by the Port River. Light Passage, named after founder of Adelaide Colonel William Light, lies in the Port River between Pelican Point and Torrens Island. Population In the 12 people were recorded as residing in Outer Harbor and the adjoining part of the suburb of Osborne. Transport The primary form of public transport in Outer Harbor is the Outer Harbor railway line which connects the area to the centre of the City of Adelaide. The terminus of this line is the Outer Harbor station, situated next to the North Haven Golf Course and Overseas Passenger Terminal. Until the 1970s Outer Harbor was a relatively isolated locality, separated from Largs Bay and Taperoo by several kilometres of sparsely occupied sand dunes and scrub. Apart from the railway, only a single loop road gave access to the port. Sections of that road presently bear four different names: Lady Gowrie Drive, Lady Ruthven Drive, Oliver Rodgers Road, and Victoria Road. Since the 1930s a singular feature of this road has been that it is bordered by an impressive avenue of Norfolk Pines. One bus route services the area, the 330, a loop service connecting with other bus services in neighbouring North Haven. Services are provided by Adelaide Metro. History Outer Harbor was established at the beginning of the 20th century, due to the increasing size of ships and the length of time it took to sail up the Port River to the inner harbour of Port Adelaide. The first ship to dock there was the RMS Oruba. on 16 January 1908.Historic berth. Portside Messenger, 16 January 2008.

History Tesqopa is not mentioned in Thomas of Marga's Book of Governors (c. 840) or any of the other early monastic histories of the Church of the East, and may well have been founded as late as the Seljuq period, perhaps in the eleventh century. It is first mentioned as a Christian village in a thirteenth-century poem by the Assyrian writer Giwargis Warda. This poem describes its sack by a raiding band of Mongols in November 1235 and the destruction of its church of Mar Yaqob the Recluse.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 202 and 234 Tesqopa was subject to many attacks by the Mongols, the worst among them was the massacre of 1436 when they attacked the town, killing thousands of its Assyrian inhabitants and burning its crops and churches, ultimately forcing the rest of the inhabitants to flee to the mountains. In 1508 Tesqopa was attacked again by the Mongols, just as they attacked Tel Keppe, Alqosh and the Monastery of Rabban Hormizd. Tesqopa was also attacked by the army of Nader Shah in 1743 during his march on Mosul. =Modern Day Tesqopa= The town received many Assyrian refugees from Baghdad and Mosul in the wake of the sectarian violence in the 2000s. On 23 April 2007 a car bomb that targeted the village resulted in more than 25 deaths. In early August 2014, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or Islamic State(IS), entered Tesqopa. But on 17 August 2014 the Kurdish Peshmerga retook Tesqopa.Asharq al-Awsat, Peshmerga retake Mosul Dam: spokesmen, 18 August 2014 After this, the local Christian Assyrians were then able to restore the crosses atop their vandalized churches.

A grandson of Axayacatl, Nephew of tlatoani Moctezuma II. He was initially the tlatoani (ruler) of Ecatepec before becoming tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, as well as its first governor under the colonial Spanish system of government. Biography =Early positions= He was initially the tlatoani (ruler) of Ecatepec before becoming tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, as well as its first governor under the colonial Spanish system of government. He had been designated governor (tlatoani) of Ecat√©pec by Moctezuma, in the year 2 T√©cpatl after the death of Chimalpilli the former tlatoani. Moctezuma was already prisoner of Cort√©s in Tenochtitlan, the people of Ecatepec accepted him as their ruler and hid him along with his mother. =Captivity and baptism= After the fall of Tenochtitlan, he was one of the five Aztec lords held captive by Cort√©s along with Cuauhtemoc, the cihuacohuatl Tlacotzin, Oquiztzin, and Motelchiuhtzin. Along them he was also tortured, with his feet burned, because of the gold lost by the Spaniards when they had to flee Tenochtitlan. Huanitzin was baptized with the Spanish Christian name Diego, and took the surname de Alvarado from his baptismal sponsor ‚Äî probably Pedro de Alvarado or one of his brothers,Lockhart (1992), p.123. whose uncle with whom they came to America was named Diego de Alvarado. =Governor of Tenochtitlan = Cort√©s took Huanitzin along with many other indigenous rulers in his travel to Honduras. He was spared from execution when Cuauhtemoc was hanged by Cort√©s along with Tetlepanquetzatzin, tlatoani of Tlacopan and don Pedro Cohuanacochtzin. After the return of Cort√©s, Huanitzin was released and returned as Tlatoani of Ecatepec, where he ruled 14 years. As grandson of a former Tlatoani, in the year 7 Tochtli (1538), he was chosen as the first governor of Tenochtitlan (Mexico), by the don Antonio de Mendoza, first viceroy of M√©xico. Tenochtitlan had been without official ruler for almost a year. Personal life and death Don Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin died in 1541. Among his children were Do√±a Juana de Alvarado, who married Huehue Totoquihuaztli, ruler of Tlacopan; Don Crist√≥bal de Guzm√°n Cecetzin, who later became governor of Tenochtitlan; Don Hernando de Alvarado Tezozomoc, an interpreter known today for the Cr√≥nica mexicayotl; and Do√±a Isabel, who married Antonio Valeriano, who would also become governor of Tenochtitlan.Chimalpahin (1997), vol. 1, pp.172‚Äì173.

Early life and education William North Rice was born November 21, 1845 in Marblehead, Massachusetts to the Rev. William Rice and Caroline Laura (North) Rice. He prepared for college at Springfield High School in Springfield, Massachusetts, and graduated in 1865 with a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, serving as class valedictorian. His interest in religious ministry began early with an invitation to preach at Grace Church in Boston shortly after his graduation in 1865. In 1867 after studies at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College, he earned the first PhD in the United States to be awarded in the field of Geology. Upon graduation from Yale, he was offered a faculty position at Wesleyan University, but he opted to undertake post-doctoral studies in Germany for a year at the renowned Institute of Natural History established by Alexander von Humboldt (1769‚Äì1859) at the University of Berlin. Later in 1886, he earned a doctor of laws (LL.D.) degree at Syracuse University. Academic career Rice served as professor of geology and natural history at Wesleyan beginning in 1868. Early in his career he was ordained as a minister, joining the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. During the early 1870s, Rice undertook zoological research work with Spencer Baird at the newly established laboratory of the United States Fish Commission at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Later in the winter 1876 to 1877, he was part of a major geological and zoological expedition to Bermuda, one of the first expeditions of its type undertaken by American scientists. In the early 1880s, Rice took an interest in the geology of Europe, traveling for research activities there in 1881 and 1884. He continued further work with European colleagues in an extended trip to Germany from 1892 to 1893, and in later to France in 1900. Beginning in 1891, Rice took an active interest in the geology of the American West, traveling to Yellowstone National Park and other Rocky Mountain locations as part of an international geological expedition. Later in 1904, he conducted research in the Grand Canyon and Mexico, and later in that decade he traveled to Alaska to study the glaciers of Yakutat Bay. Rice served as an assistant geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, mapping the geological features of Connecticut. Later from 1903 to 1918, he served as Superintendent of the State Geological and Natural History Survey of Connecticut. In addition to his scientific studies, Rice took a keen interest in issues of science and religion. He was a lecturer on the relations of religion and science at the Hamilton Theological Seminary at Colgate University between 1897 and 1900. Throughout his career he wrote a number of landmark articles and books on the reconciliation of science with religious faith. Rice was active as an officer within scientific societies. In 1891, he served as the president of the American Society of Naturalists. Later, from 1905 to 1906, he served as the vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, while concurrently serving as the chairman of the Geological Sciences division of that organization. Rice was also active in his local community by serving as a member of the Middletown Board of Education from 1884 to 1891; presiding over the board from 1885 to 1891. Later, from 1902 to 1905, he served as the president of the statewide Connecticut Council of Education. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. Rice served as acting president of Wesleyan University on three occasions in 1907, from 1908 to 1909, and again in 1918.Wesleyan University, 1831‚Äì1910: collegiate enterprise in New England By David Bronson Potts Shortly after his last stint as acting president in 1918, he retired from teaching, but continued much of his research and academic work as an emeritus professor.

The success of the Outward Bound outdoor education program in the 1940s inspired the approach taken by many current-day wilderness therapy programs, though some adopted a survivalist methodology. Young individuals aged 12‚Äì17 are the most frequent clients. Overview Wilderness therapy has had many definitions, typically involving the use of traditional therapy techniques mixed with group therapy out in a wilderness setting, approached with therapeutic intent. Wilderness therapy has been described as \\"challenge courses\\", \\"adventure-based therapy\\", and \\"wilderness experience programs\\". A variety of theoretical orientations are used in wilderness therapy, including mindfulness-based therapy and cognitive behavior therapy. According to Russell 2003, Wilderness Therapy is a program for individuals who have not had success in psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation programs, and out-patient treatment. These programs typically consist of 8-12 members that run on a 7-8-week schedule where licensed mental health professionals take clients out into the wilderness. Interventions may consist of individual, group, or family therapy sessions, and can also include individualized treatment plans, medication management, and milieu-based care. Participants are encouraged to create reflections that make them in tune with themselves and nature. The price of a wilderness therapy program is expensive, sometimes averaging $325 dollars per day with only 40 percent of clients receiving financial assistance from medical insurance. More clients may receive co-pay assistance in the future if Wilderness Therapy programs receive accreditation from national agencies and then receive recognition from insurance companies.  History  Madolyn M. Liebing, Ph.D. (of Aspen Achievement then, and currently of Journey Wilderness) was the first clinical psychologist to integrate clinical therapy with wilderness programming. The New York Asylum and the San Francisco Agnew Asylum played an early role in the development of wilderness therapy. Controversy Independent researchers have called into question the wilderness therapy industry's claims, expressing ethical concerns and criticizing its use of 'bad science' due to methodological flaws in the research. Given the proliferation of such programs, lax regulation, and absence of research setting uniform standards of care across programs, advocates have called for increased accountability to ensure programs are capable of providing care that is consistent with their marketing claims. Some programs which advertise as \\"wilderness therapy\\" are actually boot camps similar in style to military recruit training in a wilderness environment. These can sometimes be distinguished from other wilderness therapy by such programs promising behavior modification for troubled teens, but it is hard to tell just from the ads. One of the major differences between military style boot camps and wilderness therapy is the underlying philosophical assumptions (wilderness therapy being driven by the philosophy of experiential education and theories of psychology, and boot camps being informed by a military model). Incidents of alleged and confirmed abuse and deaths of youths have been widely reported across many wilderness programs, despite claims that these programs provide a less coercive environment than that of boot camps. Abusive situations have been reported and accidental deaths have taken place in some of these programs. The industry reports that deaths are extremely rare compared with similar outdoor adventure activities. These assertions cannot be independently verified due to inadequate regulation, poor monitoring, and a pattern of unreported deaths and state failure to prosecute offenders. There is also controversy over whether parents should be allowed to make their child attend a wilderness therapy program by force, as is often the case. Apart from the thousands spent on the actual program (around $500/day), some parents pay a teen escort company thousands to ensure their child gets to the program by any means necessary, without the child's consent or foreknowledge. Generally the \\"transfer\\" occurs at night, when children are disoriented. Due to the trauma and alleged harm reported by former wilderness program residents who have been forcibly escorted into placement, psychologists have heavily criticized this approach as inappropriate, and grossly inconsistent with establishing the necessary trust required for building a therapeutic relationship between youth and providers. Accountability In October 2007 and April 2008, the United States Government Accountability Office convened hearings to address reports of widespread and systemic abuse. In connection to the hearing, they issued a report about the wilderness therapy industry. The Federal Trade Commission has published a list of questions for parents to ask when considering a wilderness program. Programs seeking additional accreditation and certification often pursue partnerships and memberships with associations such as: * Therapeutic Consultant Association * The Association for Experiential Education * The Better Business Bureau * Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth * Independent Educational Consultant Association * Leave No Trace Center for Backcountry Ethics * National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers * The Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare Council After the program After a wilderness therapy program, clients may return home or may be transferred to a therapeutic boarding school, young adult program, or intensive residential treatment center. Some estimate that 40% of children enrolled in wilderness programs are later sent to long-term residential behavioral care facilities.

It was the home and studio of Georgia O'Keeffe, as well as the subject of many of her paintings. Ghost Ranch is also known for a remarkable concentration of fossils, most notably that of the theropod dinosaur Coelophysis, of which it has been estimated that nearly a thousand individuals have been preserved in a quarry at Ghost Ranch. History Ghost Ranch is part of Piedra Lumbre (Spanish, \\"Shining Rock\\"), a 1766 land grant to Pedro Martin Serrano from Charles III of Spain. The Rito del Yeso is a stream that meanders through the canyons and gorge, providing a drought-resistant source of water for life to thrive. In 1976, Ghost Ranch was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. The canyon was first inhabited by the Archuleta brothers, cattle rustlers who enjoyed the coverage and invisibility that the canyon provided as well as their ability to see for miles down the valley. They created two jacal homes and would move stolen cattle throughout the night to Box Canyon. By transporting the cattle through streams, footprints would be lost and they could not be tracked. Stories of people staying with the Archuleta brothers who had gone missing (and their clothing on the men) circulated around the area. One day one of the brothers made a transaction without the other, and claimed he had buried the gold for safety. The second brother killed him, and kept his wife and daughter hostage until they admitted to knowing where the gold was hidden. Although the mother and daughter feared the rumored spirits of the canyon, they mustered up the courage to sneak away at night through the Chama Valley.Poling-Kempes, Lesley. Ghost Ranch. Tucson: The University of Arizona Press, 2005. Print. A group of local men then came to the ranch, fighting through their fear, and hanged the remaining brother and his gang from a cottonwood tree that still stands next to one of the casitas on the property. Other visitors who stayed in the casita later on noted that they could hear voices of a man and a woman fighting. =Arthur Pack= Roy Pfaffle won the deed to the ranch in a poker game sometime early in 1928. His wife, Carol Stanley, recorded the deed in her name, decided to name the place Ghost Ranch, and moved there two years later, after divorcing Pfaffle.Poling-Kempes, Lesley, Ladies of the Canyon, University of Arizona Press, 2015, p. 287-291 Stanley constructed guest quarters and created an exclusive dude ranch that was visited by many of the wealthy and creative people of the time. Eventually many of her friends moved to New Mexico for its peaceful atmosphere. One of the most influential people to visit Ghost Ranch was Arthur Newton Pack, writer and editor of Nature Magazine. Arthur's daughter suffered from bouts of pneumonia, so he and his family had to move to an area with a drier climate, and he came to Stanley's ranch. Although her clientele were wealthy, Stanley was having trouble breaking even; she sold the ranch to Arthur Pack in 1935. As Arthur Pack aged, he began to take concern in how the ranch would be passed on. He spoke with the YMCA, the Boy Scouts of America, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe, and the United Brethren Church about having and maintaining the ranch. But none of these organizations were in a position to accept the offer. Then, the Presbyterians accepted the offer of using the space as an educational facility, though it would be difficult for them to develop. Now, the ranch is used as an educational and retreat center, where over 300 classes are offered each year. =Georgia O'Keeffe= Georgia O'Keeffe, intrigued by Arthur Pack's statement that the Piedra Lumbre was \\"the best place in the world\\",Poling-Kempes, Lesley. Ghost Ranch. Tuscan: The University of Arizona Press, 2005. Print. p. 106. visited the ranch and fell in love with the geography. Soon thereafter, she split her time between New York and New Mexico. She enjoyed having alone time, and was often very demanding of the Packs. Cerro Pedernal was a key geographical feature that could be often found in her paintings. =2015 flash flood= On July 7, 2015, a flash flood occurred in Ghost Ranch due to severe weather that destroyed several buildings at the ranch. No injuries or deaths were caused by the flood. Geology and palaeontology 200 million years ago Ghost Ranch and the American Southwest were located close to the equator, and had a warm, monsoon- like climate with heavy seasonal precipitation. Ghost Ranch includes a famous palaeontological site preserving Triassic dinosaurs. Fossil bones were found here as early as 1885. In 1947 the palaeontologist Edwin H. Colbert documented the discovery of over a thousand well-preserved fossilized skeletons of a small Triassic dinosaur called Coelophysis in a quarry here.O'Connor, Anahad. - \\"E. H. Colbert, 96, Dies; Wrote Dinosaur Books \\". - New York Times. - November 25, 2001. In 2007, fossil remains of Dromomeron romeri, one of the archaic group of animals recognized as basal dinosauromorphs, were found in the Hayden Quarry.Herrmann, Andrew. - \\"Grad student finds 'pre-dinosaur' - Part of team to discover 210 million-year-old species in N.M.\\". - Chicago Sun- Times. - July 20, 2007. ‚Äî Mullen, William. - \\"Fossil prompts new dinosaur theory - Discovery is changing conventional wisdom on how quickly beasts came to rule Earth\\". - Chicago Tribune. - July 20, 2007. ‚Äî Gerber, Marty. - \\"Fossils Show Dinosaurs Coexisted with ancestors\\". - Santa Fe New Mexican. - July 20, 2007. In April 2010, a team of scientists led by Hans-Dieter Sues of the Smithsonian Institution reported the discovery of Daemonosaurus chauliodus, a basal theropod species, at Ghost Ranch. Daemonosaurus lived approximately 205 million years ago, during a transitional period between the oldest known dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus, which existed during the Late Triassic period in what is now known as Argentina and Brazil, and the more advanced theropod dinosaurs.

He attended Amherst College from 1845 through 1848, but left without graduating after three years due to financial hardship. Amherst, though, nonetheless later awarded him an honorary degree. Between 1852 and 1868, he served as headmaster of high schools at Dorchester, Lawrence, Salem, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Early in his career, he edited selections from Ovid and Virgil and (in collaboration) the Cambridge Course of Physics (six volumes, 1867‚Äì68). Rolfe's Shakespearean work began with an American edition of George Lillie Craik's English of Shakespeare (3rd revised ed., 1864, ), which Crosby and Ainsworth published in 1867 (). This led to his preparation for Harper & Brothers of a complete edition of Shakespeare ‚Äì the Friendly Edition (forty volumes, 1870‚Äì83; new edition, 1903‚Äì07). Rolfe's editions proved to be the best-selling versions in America (during a time of increased use of Shakespeare in high school classrooms) due both to his credentials as a high school administrator and to his use of Bowdlerization of the text in order to remove much of Shakespeare's lewd content. Rolfe also edited a complete edition of Tennyson (twelve volumes, 1898) and verse by many of the other great English poets.

(July 18, 1847 - December 20, 1923) was an American chemist,and the first President of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1908. Life Sadtler was born at Pine Grove, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, the son of a Lutheran minister, and educated at Pennsylvania College (class of 1867), at Lehigh University (one year), at Lawrence Scientific School (BSc 1870), and in Europe at the University of G√∂ttingen (PhD 1871). As well as his professional activities, he was active in the Lutheran church. Samuel Schmucker Sadtler His son, Samuel Schmucker Sadtler, also became a chemist. In 1901 they founded Samuel P. Sadtler & Son, a chemical consulting firm in Philadelphia. It was later managed by his grandson, also named Samuel Philip Sadtler. Samuel Philip Sadtler died December 20, 1923, in Philadelphia. Career Samuel Philip Sadtler was first a professor at Pennsylvania College (1871‚Äì74) and then the University of Pennsylvania (1874‚Äì91). He then moved to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he was professor of chemistry until 1916 when he retired (and Emeritus professor afterwards). He was author of: Hand-Book of Chemical Experimentation (1877); Industrial Organic Chemistry (1901; fourth edition, 1912); and Pharmaceutical Chemistry (1895; fourth edition, 1912), with Virgil Coblentz. In 1907 to 1908 Samuel Philip Sadtler was part of a discussion as to the formation of a society separate from the American Chemical Society for the newly recognized profession of chemical engineering. He was initially opposed to the proliferation of societies but said he would join a chemical engineering one if it was formed. On June 22, 1908, he welcomed interested people to a meeting at the Engineers Club, Philadelphia. The forty men present became Charter Members of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, electing Sadtler as the President, a post he held till the end of 1909. He made his Presidential address at the first Annual Meeting on December 28, 1908, and also established the Transactions of the AIChE in the same year.

They currently play in the and are based at the War Memorial Sports Ground. History =Early years= Carshalton Athletic traces its roots to two separate teams playing in the area of Wrythe Green in Carshalton in the early twentieth century. Whilst the club's history is dated to the formation of Mill Lane Mission in 1905 it also recognises the importance of officials, players and supporters of Carshalton St Andrews in its history. Mill Lane Mission was organised by the Mill Lane Mission recreational facility for teenage boys and began playing friendlies in 1903. They were formally registered with the Surrey County FA in September 1905 and continued to play only friendly matches until 1906 when they joined the Croydon & District League Division 2A. During 1905 and 1906 discussions were held with Carshalton St Andrews over amalgamation. Carshalton St Andrews was formed in 1897 by the vicar of St Andrews, Revd. C.W. Cleaver and began playing in the Surrey County Herald League. In 1902 they were promoted into the Southern Suburban League Division 2 West. They agreed to fold and amalgamate with Mill Lane Mission in 1906 but did not formally do so until they had honoured their remaining obligations at the end of the 1907‚Äì08 season. Meanwhile, Mill Lane Mission registered their name change with the Surrey F.A. and began playing under the name Carshalton Athletic F.C. in 1907. The first ever match under this name was on 7 September 1907 at home on the Wrythe Green recreation ground in a friendly against Westbrook (Thornton Heath). Carshalton Athletic's original colours were those inherited from St Andrews who played in Red with white stripes. After the name change the club went on to win successive promotions in 1908, 1909 and 1910 which were rewarded with election to the Junior Division of the Southern Suburban League. During this time the club put out a reserve side and a midweek Carshalton Wednesday side (many different clubs set up these sides to play after the shops had shut 'early' on Wednesdays) and these two sides both performed well ‚Äì the reserves winning the Croydon and District League Division 2A in 1909 and Carshalton Wednesday were runners up in the inaugural Surrey County Midweek Cup. Before the outbreak of the First World War further success in both league and junior cup competitions was achieved. In 1913 the club won the Suburban League Division 1 West and the following season added the Suburban League Division 1 East title to this. In the same period they also won the Surrey Junior Cup, Surrey Junior Charity Cup and the Croydon Charity Cup and were runners up in the London Junior Cup. The outbreak of the war curtailed this period of success and the club went into a period of suspended animation during the war as its home ground was given over to agricultural use. Following the reformation of the club on 31 March 1919, and after playing on a number of different grounds, Carshalton Athletic finally moved into their new (and current) home in Colston Avenue during the 1920‚Äì21 season. This was built as a memorial to those members of the club who lost their lives in the War. The interwar years were otherwise relatively uneventful. The only silverware the club won was the Surrey Intermediate Cup, in 1922 and 1932. In the league, the club remained in the Southern Suburban League, finishing as runners up in 1922 before becoming founding members of the Surrey Senior League in the 1922‚Äì23 season. At the same time the club gained Football Association senior club status and this allowed Carshalton Athletic to enter FA national competitions and county senior cups for the first time. =Post-war and the Corinthian League= With the upheavals of the Second World War in Europe over, preparations for the resumption in football at Colston Avenue began 1945 with applications made to join the London League (senior side) Surrey Intermediate League (reserve side) and to enter the London Senior and Surrey Senior cups. The club did not apply to enter the FA Challenge Cup or FA Amateur Cup because facilities at the ground were not up to standard for these competitions. The club did make it a priority to improve the standard of the ground and facilities to make them suitable for the higher reaches of the amateur game but all this work had to be funded and carried out by volunteers as the local District Council were unwilling to help support these improvements. Fortunately it proved possible to find volunteers and donors to enable this work to be carried out. The work on the ground proved to be needed the following season as Carshalton Athletic were elected into the Corinthian League, which had been set up in the previous year, for the 1946‚Äì47 season. Several years of indifferent league form followed with only minor highlights in cup competitions, although the club continued to grow as evidenced by a record attendance of over 8000 for an FA Challenge Cup 3rd round qualifying tie against local rivals Tooting and Mitcham United. Behind the scenes the club was taking steps to improve the club's chances on the pitch including hiring a coach for all sides for the first time but the club committee ensured that they retained the final say in selection decisions. A far better period began with the first match Carshalton Athletic played against a team from overseas at the start of the 1952‚Äì53 season. Hengelo from the Netherlands were the opponents in what was to become a regular friendly fixture over following years. Carshalton went on to win the Corinthian League title by 3 points from Hounslow Town at the end of the season and the reserve team finished second in their league, 2 points behind Uxbridge. The 1953‚Äì54 season brought further success as Carshalton Athletic retain the league title, finishing 2 points ahead of Edgware Town, although cup success was still proving elusive. This was rectified somewhat in the 1954‚Äì55 season as the club reached the final of the Surrey Senior Shield and the quarter finals of the FA Amateur Cup for the first time in their history (this was also the first year in which two Corinthian League teams reached the quarter finals). The 1955‚Äì56 season was unremarkable on the pitch but did see further advances around the ground as Carshalton Athletic's success of recent season was reflected in the size of the supporters club with over 2000 members. It was also the club's last appearance in the Corinthian League as the summer of 1956 saw election to the Athenian League. =Athenian League= For the next 17 years the club competed in the Athenian League with very little success never really threatening to win the league, and finishing at the bottom of the table twice (1959‚Äì60 and 1960‚Äì61 seasons). Their best performance coming in the 1963‚Äì64 season when the club managed to finish the season in third place. Around the ground floodlights were finally erected on six pylons in 1967. Limited cup success was achieved. A first appearance in the Surrey Senior Cup final came in the 1957‚Äì58 season, although Dulwich Hamlet won the final 1‚Äì0 and it would be another 31 years before Carshalton Athletic appeared in the final again. There was also success in the FA Amateur Cup as the club reached the quarter finals for the second time in 1959‚Äì60. In the same season the club won the Southern Combination Cup for the first time, after losing in the final the previous season. =Isthmian League 1973‚Äì2004= In the summer of 1973 Carshalton Athletic finally achieved a promotion of sorts when they were elected as founder members of the newly created Isthmian League Division 2. The first two seasons proved to be a struggle and in their third they just missed out on promotion finishing third in the league. Three years of struggle paid off in the 1976‚Äì77 season when promotion to the Isthmian Premier Division after finishing as runners up in the league in a year in which they also won the Surrey Senior Shield. After promotion in the league the club entered another period of struggling, not finishing in the top half until the 1987‚Äì88 season. This coincided with the start of years of upheaval in the organisation of the ownership and running of the club both on and off the field. The best that could be offered to supporters in this period was a solitary cup run as the club reached the second round proper of the FA Challenge Cup for the first time before losing 4‚Äì1 to Fourth Division Torquay United. Over this period Carshalton Athletic had 8 different managers and it was only the final appointment of Billy Smith in August 1986 that began to turn the club's fortunes around. The first Billy Smith era lasted for nearly 9 years and was the most successful period in the club's history. During his time in charge of the club twice reaching the 1st Round Proper of the FA Challenge Cup, winning the Surrey Senior Cup three times in four years and reaching the final 5 times in 7 years, recording its highest ever placing in the league at the end of the 1988‚Äì89 season and winning the London Challenge Cup in 1991. This period came to an end when Billy Smith left to take charge of Kingstonian, and was followed by a rapid turnover of managers. Under John Rains, the club reached the third round of the FA Trophy. Gary Kilby led them to the first round proper of the 1997‚Äì98 FA Cup, in which they lost to Stevenage Borough after a replay, and former player Gary Bowyer twice led a successful fight against relegation. In 2000, with the club in severe financial difficulties, the ownership changed hands twice, Bowyer was dismissed, the clubhouse was destroyed in an arson attack, and the ground's landlords, Sutton Council, threatened the club with eviction for breaching their lease. At the end of that season, Carshalton were relegated to Division One. Two years later, Graham Roberts led them to the Division One South title, to gain promotion to the Premier Division. The following season, they finished seventh, thus qualifying for the new Conference South. =Conference South= After a ¬£12 million plan to rebuild the ground fell through, chairman Steve Friend resigned, followed by manager Billy Smith. Under Jimmy Bolton, Carshalton retained their place in the Conference South in 2004‚Äì05, but in 2005‚Äì06, the club's centenary season, they were relegated back to the Isthmian League. =Isthmian League 2006‚Äìpresent= Carshalton finished mid table in 2006‚Äì07 but the following season 2007‚Äì08 saw disappointing early results and as a result the manager Dave Garland left the club in October 2007. First team coach Hayden Bird was then appointed to take the helm. Hayden made some high- profile signings and there was a noticeable commitment to playing attractive, passing football but the Robins still faced another nail-biting fight for survival in the Isthmian League Premier Division. With just 7 games to go the club was purchased by Paul Dipre who injected sufficient funds to strengthen the squad in an effort to avoid relegation. It went right to the wire and, miraculously, last day results elsewhere fell perfectly and Carshalton's home win over Tonbridge Angels was enough to secure their status. The season 2008‚Äì09 was the first full season under new ownership. The reserves and junior sections were axed in favour of a new academy and junior section, buildings and facilities were upgraded, staff and personnel were changed and at the end of this season the club also changed its badge and its playing colours from maroon, to red. On the pitch, aided with 31 goals from Richard Jolly, The Robins finished in 4th place, setting up a play-off semi-final with Tonbridge Angels. Athletic claimed a thrilling 3-2 win to meet Staines Town in the final. Held at Staines's Wheatsheaf Park Ground, Carshalton more than held their own against Staines, who had finished 2nd in the regular season. Sadly for The Robins, an 85th-minute penalty was saved by Staines 'keeper Louis Wells, and Scott Taylor scored an extra-time winner for Staines. On 1 September 2009, manager Hayden Bird resigned as the club's first team manager; Ian Hazel was placed in caretaker charge. On 10 September the club announced the appointment of former Carshalton player Francis Vines as Bird's permanent replacement. Shortly before the 2010‚Äì11 season Mark Butler was placed in charge of the club. After a promising first half of the season, Butler's results went from bad to worse until he was sacked and the owner Paul Dipre took the reins. The team finished 13th. The 2011‚Äì12 season was a rollercoaster for the first team. Dipre was tipped to win the league in his first season, but a rocky league performance ended in a lowly 16th position. Despite the poor league form there was much to celebrate in the FA Trophy with one of the most historic results in the club's history when they beat Lincoln City 3‚Äì1 at Colston Avenue, Paul Vines scoring a hat-trick. Dipre's squad also reach the semi-finals of the Surrey Senior Cup for the first time in 20 years. 2011‚Äì12 was a mixed year for the club overall. Carshalton Athletic were awarded the Community Club of the year award and became one of the largest community clubs in the UK with over 40 junior/youth teams including 7 girls/ladies teams. The club also built on its financial base by growing turnover to ¬£430,000 ‚Äì a 300% increase over three years. Dipre made a gift of shares to some of the supporters. In 2012‚Äì13 Dipre removed himself from the manager's position after only one win in the club's opening six league games. Coach Tommy Williams, also a former player of the club, took the reins and officially took the job in October 2012. Carshalton Athletic was bestowed with three community club awards throughout 2012 ‚Äì the South East Regional Community Club of the Year, the Surrey FA Community Club of the Year and the FA National Community Club of the Year, the latter awarded to chairman Frank Williams and youth development officer Paul Williams by ex-professional footballers Chris Kamara and Martin Keown, plus TV presenter Ben Shepherd. Carshalton finished 21st in the 2012‚Äì13 Isthmian League Premier Division, which ordinarily would have seen them relegated. However, a points deduction and consequent relegation for Thurrock gave them a reprieve, keeping them in the Isthmian Premier for the 2013‚Äì2014 Season. Despite the reprieve, the Club finished 23rd in the 2013‚Äì14 Isthmian League Premier Division and were relegated. After several season's in Isthmian League South, the club finally won promotion in style, sealing the 2017‚Äì18 Isthmian League South Division title with a 7‚Äì0 win on the final day of the season; ending the season with 102 Points Rivals Carshalton Athletic's main rivals include Sutton United, AFC Wimbledon (although since AFC Wimbledon are now four leagues higher in the pyramid the rivalry is not reciprocated by their fans), Kingstonian, and Tooting & Mitcham. Carshalton have a fierce rivalry with their nearest neighbours Sutton United as they are both based in the London Borough of Sutton. Throughout the two clubs' histories the 'Derby' matches have been contested in both the Isthmian League and the Conference South, and always draw crowds of over 1,000. Stadium Carshalton Athletic play their home games at the War Memorial Sports Ground located at Colston Ave, Carshalton, Sutton. From the formation of Mill Lane Mission until 1906 the club played on a pitch hired in Carshalton Park moving to a pitch in the Wrythe Recreation Ground (and using the Cricketers pub opposite as a 'clubhouse') when they joined the Croydon & District League. Here they remained until the outbreak of war in 1914. During the war many open spaces and parks were used for agricultural purposes which meant that when football finally resumed in 1919 the old pitch needed to be levelled and resown with grass and so was unavailable for use. A temporary ground was loaned to the club by a market gardener named G. Mizen, in what was known as Culvers Park (now covered by housing as Culvers Avenue) and it was here that the club resumed playing in the Southern Suburban League. Knowing that the Culvers Park ground could only ever be a temporary measure, the Secretary and committee of the club continued to investigate alternative arrangements. Eventually a local area of land, known as Shorts Farm, was discovered to be for sale. Whilst the club certainly did not have the funds to purchase all of land, it was hoped that they could negotiate a separate sale of to be set aside as a War Memorial and dedicated to sports. After several convoluted sales and purchases the local District Council acquired the land and the club were able to lease the land they needed and to build the facilities they desired on the land. The opening match on the ground took place on 1 January 1921 against Thornville in the Sutton Hospital Charity Cup. Colston Avenue photographed in 2007 Gradually improvements were made to the ground. In 1926 a grandstand was acquired from Epsom Downs Racecourse, dismantled, moved and rebuilt on the ground to provide much needed seating. This survived until it was finally blown down by gales in March 1968. Slowly each side was converted from grass banking to terracing (this work finally being completed in 1991) and various offices, dressing rooms, coverings for terraces and a clubhouse and function room were added to the site. Floodlights were added in 1967 and a new grandstand was built in 1972 and extended in 1996. A great many of these structures were destroyed in an arson attack in 2000 which gutted the clubhouse, a new 'temporary' clubhouse has been in place since 2000. In August 2003 the club submitted plans for a ¬£12 million rebuild of the current stadium to include additional community facilities. The intention was to increase the level of usage of the site to allow the club to become self-financing. Local residents objected to the proposed increase in use and in light of the number of local residents opposed to the expansion the club withdrew their application for planning permission. In 2015, Carshalton Athletic replaced their grass pitch with an artificial, 3G pitch,https://www.therobins.club/ground after winning planning permission beforehand. In 2018, Carshalton Athletic hosted a number of games in the 2018 CONIFA World Football Cup. Carshalton Athletic Ladies Carshalton Athletic Ladies was formed in 2011 and has since expanded to now include a reserve team, plus several girls‚Äô teams ranging from under 10s to under 16s. The long-term aims include bringing players through the Girls set- up into the Ladies section, utilising the Carshalton Athletic FC Girls Football Academy in place at Stanley Park High School, Carshalton. The Ladies' first team play their home matches at Colston Avenue sharing the same pitch as the men's first team. They are managed by Harrison Williams, with Paul Williams and Joanna Goodwin, appointed Assistant Manager and Coach respectively for the 2017/18 season. The First Team play in the London and South East Regional Women's League, Premier Division. Recent triumphs include the First Team winning the John Greenacre Memorial Trophy in the 2012/13 season, having won the Ladies' first trophy within two-years of its existence. In the same season the First Team finished runners-up in the London and South East Regional Women's League, Division One (London). Carshalton Athletic Pan Disability Squad Carshalton Athletic Pan Disability Squad was formed as a joint venture between the club and the Surrey FA in 2013. Free 1hr coaching sessions were held in Brookfield park by Lee Atkinson (the club's Development & Disability coach) for a 10-week period offering football to Adults (16+) with Learning Disabilities. The number of attendees grew each week and at the end of the 10-week period training continued with what was now a 'squad' of players. The squad is still managed by Lee and currently has 18 players fielding 2 teams that both play in the Surrey Football For All Premier League with teams such as Chelsea, Fulham and Hampton & Richmond. Two players have trialled for the England u19s LD Squad and, one went on to play at the Chelsea Cerebral Palsy CoE. The team have experienced both league and cup success coming 3rd in the Premier League in their very first season despite entering halfway through the season. And, then winning the Premier League in both 2014/15 & 2015/16 seasons. Their cup success saw them make it to the semi- final of the Ryman Disability Cup and won a 3rd-place winners medal in the Regional Disability Cup both in the 2014/15 season. The teams currently sit 2nd and 3rd in the 2016/17 Premier League.

Nathaniel Schmidt (May 22, 1862 ‚Äì June 29, 1939) of Ithaca, New York, was a Swedish American Baptist minister, Christian Hebraist, orientalist, professor, theologian and progressive Democrat. Background Schmidt was born at Hudiksvall Municipality, in the historical province of H√§lsingland, G√§vleborg County, Sweden. His parents were Lars Peter Anderson and Fredericka Wilhelmina Schmidt. Taking his mother's name when he became an adult, Schmidt married Miss Ellen Alfv√©n, of Stockholm, Sweden on September 26, 1887. She was the daughter of Anders Alfv√©n and Charlotta Christina Axelson Puke. Their daughter, Dagmar A. Schmidt, Cornell Class of 1918, (Mrs. Oliver S. Wright, b. 1896), lived in Rockville Center, New York, at the time of the Schmidt's death (1939). He was an avid rower, swimmer and hiker. He lived on Ithaca's Six Mile Creek. He received his primary and secondary education at the Hudiksvall Gymnasium, graduating in 1882. He studied scientific and linguistic studies at the University of Stockholm from 1882 to 1884. In the summer of 1884 he emigrated to the United States and entered Hamilton Theological Seminary (Colgate University), from which he took his master of arts in 1887. In 1887 Schmidt received his master of arts from Colgate University, the same year he took a degree from Hamilton Theological Seminary. During 1896, Schmidt studied Ethiopic and Arabic literature, history and theology, at the University of Berlin,Schmidt, Nathaniel (Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 24. Ryssl√§der - Sekret√§r / ) Swedish studying under scholars such as August Dillmann, Eberhard Schrader, Friedrich Dieterici, Otto Pfleiderer, and Adolf von Harnack. The Jewish Institute of Religion conferred a doctorate of Hebrew letters upon him in 1931. Benjamin N. Cardozo was the commencement speaker.\\"Cardozo Advocates Pursuit of an Ideal,\\" The New York Times (May 25, 1931). Theology A few years prior to his death and reflecting on his life's work, Schmidt used a speech before the Society for Ethical Culture to note that theology, as an area of study, could survive and maintain its influence as a science dealing with religious phenomena only if it increased its level of scrutiny and found new ways of practical application.Asserts Theology is at the Crossroads; Prof. Nathaniel Schmidt Says It Must Change as Alchemy Once Did, N.Y. Times (March 2, 1931). Schmidt reserved some of his more caustic critique for Christian denominations holding to practices which no longer served the purposes upon adoption.\\"Legacy of the Quakers,\\" The New York Times (Feb. 9, 1903). Schmidt's theology was literal and non-traditional. He found no evidence in Scriptures for the miraculous birth of the Christ, nor did the traditional love songs of David prophesy the coming of the Messiah.\\"Free Religion Association; Various Conceptions of Jesus Expounded at a Meeting in Boston,\\" The New York Times (June 1, 1901, reporting on a meeting of the Free Religious Association of America). In 1930, Albert Einstein prompted a theological discussion through the New York Times Magazine. Eight renown theologians responded to the physicist's views on religion. The Reverend John Haynes Holmes of the Community Church endorsed Einstein's view and noted that it answered one half of two essential questions in human existence. The first question, what is this world? The answer to that question is provided by \\"Science.\\" The second question, what can be done with the world? The answer to that question is provided by \\"Religion.\\" In laying out this analysis, Reverend Holmes noted, \\"[t]his is surely what Professor Nathaniel Schmidt means when he says in this recent book, \\"The Coming Religion,\\" that religion is \\"man's consciousness of some power in nature determining man's destiny, and the ordering of his life in harmony with its demands.\\"Professor Einstein's \\"Cosmic Religion\\": A Symposium; Eight Ministers Define Religion in Light of the Scientist's Statement (Nov. 16, 1930). The commenter then continued by noting that Schmidt's work in The Coming Religion established the theological framework for theology half of Einstein's two-question dichotomy. There is a sense in Schmidt's work of the late 1920s and early 1930s that the First World War changed the nature of people's religious beliefs. In particular, he observed that traditional manifestations of religious expression were in decline, but that the boundaries of religious expression were expanding, and \\"the essence of religion gaining in clarity, purity and depth.\\"Negro Plight Held Worse Under NRA, N.Y. Times (Dec. 11, 1933). With respect to the study of the Hebraic roots of Western culture, Schmidt's final position was that the expansion of historical knowledge, a widening of the historians subject-matter reach, had lessened the importance of Hebrew heritage.Prof. Schmidt, 77, of Cornell, Dead, N.Y. Times (July 1, 1939). Career For two years (1887‚Äì1888) Schmidt was pastor of the First Swedish Baptist Church in New York City. He resigned in fall 1887 to take a position as professor of Semitic languages and literatures at Colgate University (1888‚Äì1896). Schmidt was also full professor of Semitic Languages and Literature in Hamilton Theological Seminary. Schmidt later held the same position at Cornell University (1896‚Äì1932) for thirty-six years. He was the founder of Colgate University's Assyriology program. A year after taking his masters from Colgate, he was appointed professor of Semitic Languages and Literature. Though the teaching of Hebrew was his primary tasking at Colgate, he developed a two-hour course in the history of Babylonia and Assyria. Following his departure for Cornell, Schmidt's work was taken up by Colgate's George Ricker Berry (1865‚Äì1945).G. Wade Meade, Road to Babylon (1974) at 38. = Oriental studies at Cornell = Nathaniel Schmidt's Cornell work was part of a larger early university effort to focus studies on the Near East. In March 1868, Cornell's President-elect Andrew Dickson White sailed to Europe to inspect leading institutions of agricultural and industrial education, recruit faculty, purchase laboratory apparatus, equipment, and books. Cornell Faculty appointees provided White with booklists and the Cornell Board of Trustees allocated $11,000 in February 1868 to make what became \\"large purchases of books at Paris, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Berlin and London.\\" While visiting the University of Berlin, White obtained the first of several private book collections which formed the beginning of the Cornell Library. The 2,500 volume personal library of University of Berlin philologist Franz Bopp was offered for sale by the scholar's estate. The collection was rich in Near Eastern studies sources. After White returned to Ithaca, the Cornell Board of Trustees authorized the purchase Charles Anton's 7,000 volume library. The Anton library added materials on classical languages, literatures and ancient history. Nathaniel Schmidt took up the teaching of Hebrew at Cornell in 1896, thirty years after the University committed to the teaching of subjects related to the Near East. The first Hebrew instruction offered in Cornell's \\"College of Languages\\" was in AY 1868-69. The Reverend William D. Wilson instructed. Wilson was \\"in charge of Philosophy, the Registrar's office, and any miscellaneous subject that happened to be demanded. Most people agreed that he was a dear old white- bearded saint; but he represented the clerical amateurism of earlier times, when godliness redeemed every lack of intellectual rigor.\\"Morris Bishop, A History of Cornell (1963). During AY 1870-1871, Hebrew course taught by Wilson was augmented by a Persian-language course taught by Willard Fiske. The course mustered six students. It met in the evening in Fiske's study. With AY 1874-75, Cornell sought to expand its Near Eastern (then called \\"Oriental\\") studies. Instruction was to be given in Persian, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and the other Semitic languages as there may be classes of students requiring them. The Department of Hebrew and Oriental Literature and History used the lecture system of teaching. It taught the ancient Hebrew literature and history. The notion of \\"Near Eastern studies\\" was explicitly centered around \\"Hebrew\\". Other peoples were included only in so far as the \\"national idea of this people cannot be studied to advantage, in its growth and development, without some knowledge of the relations it bears to those eastern nations by which Palestine is surrounded.\\"Cornell University, Middle East & Islamic Studies Collection, History and Development of the Cornell University Library Collections on the Middle East ( 2010). The goal of teaching Hebrew and its associated subjects as area studies was realized temporarily in March 1874 when a group headed by the New York financier Joseph Seligman provided a three-year endowment for a Chair of Hebrew and Oriental Literature and History. Seligman insisted that he chose the incumbent. He chose Dr. Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture). Adler took his bachelor's degree at Columbia College and his doctorate at the University of Heidelberg. He was \\"... young, handsome, and popular with the students. His lectures attracted large audiences and many visitors, especially among the ladies of Ithaca.\\" His views on contemporary religious, philosophical and ethical matters made him a continual target of those who wished to attack the University. Although these attackers found it difficult to define exactly the heretical nature of Adler's lectures, in Acting President Russel's words \\"people talk about 'the tendency, the tendency!'\\"Cornell University, Middle East & Islamic Studies Collection, History and Development of the Cornell University Library Collections on the Middle East ((2010)). The Acting President found himself trying to defend Adler's right to express his views, rather than his teaching of Hebrew. After two years it was determined that systematic instruction in Semitics was not being realized. In 1876 the University dropped Adler. This insulted Seligman and relieved Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Henry W. Sage. It also induced Cornell alumnus John Frankenheimer, grandfather of Hollywood producer of the same name, to run for an open seat on the Cornell Board of Trustees, alleging anti-Semitism. Adler later founded the Society of Ethical Culture, of which Nathaniel Schmidt was a fellow and lecturer. Adler's termination left Cornell's Oriental studies program in the portfolio of Professor Wilson, who added instruction in Chaldee and Ancient Syriac. Otto Roehrig Both the Reverend Wilson and Adler taught Hebrew from a particular social and religious perspective. Wilson was an evangelical Protestant and Adler was a Zionist. Working with them at Cornell during the same period was another professor whose approach was not dictated primarily by either perspective: Frederick Louis Otto Roehrig. Of the German states by birth, Professor Roehrig took both his degrees at the University of Halle. He then served in diplomatic, medical and language-teaching capacities within the Turkish Empire, Greece, France, and the frontier American Northwest. The Sultan of the Turkish Empire decorated him for authoring his treatise on Turkish grammar. He also aided the Smithsonian Institution with contributions on several Native American languages. Arriving at Cornell in 1869 as an assistant professor of French, he expanded the University's offerings to as vast array of Oriental languages by AY 1879-80: the living Asiatic Languages, Sanskrit, Old Persian, and Arabic; elementary Chinese, Japanese grammar (including practical exercises in the Hiragana character, etc.); Mantchoos, Turkish, the Tartar languages, and Turanian Philology, among others. By the happenstance of Roehrig's passion for Near Eastern linguistics, Cornell University developed a niche speciality within the American education market. The demand for these subjects was weak among Cornell's students. In AY 1878-79, Roehrig's course in Ancient Arabic mustered a mere six students, while Modern Arabic mustered only three; in AY 1879-80 only one Arabic student enrolled; but in AY1880-81 a full ten students enrolled. As for the rationale these students offered for wanting to take Arabic, some students studying Arabic had studied Hebrew and view Arabic mainly as a comparative study of the two Semitic tongues, some Jewish students were well acquainted with Hebrew and took Arabic to gain a broader foundation to their knowledge. Some came to acquire the language practically, contemplating travel or business in the Mashriq and Maghreb. When Roehrig departed Cornell, so too did much of the university's Near Eastern expertise. = The Schmidt years at Cornell = In September 1896, Cornell's president Jacob Gould Schurman prevailed upon the Board of Trustees to extend an offer to Schmidt.\\"Professor Schmidt Goes to Cornell,\\" The New York Times (Sept. 5, 1896). The situation at Colgate's Divinity School had deteriorated. Schmidt's unorthodox theology generated discomfort within that college. From 1886 to his arrival in 1896, Cornell's Library maintained its support for the acquisition of Near Eastern materials. Taking over as Cornell President, Jacob Gould Schurman decided Cornell needed a chair of Hebrew language. In 1896, Schurman persuaded Henry W. Sage to finance a professorship of Semitic Languages and Literatures for AY1896-97 and AY 1897-98. He knew the University could secure Schmidt at a bargain. Schmidt's unorthodox theological views made his stay at Colgate Divinity School untenable. Schmidt gained the respect of the Cornell community. Noted for his personal and scholarly integrity, he was soon shielded by sympathetic administrators. Schmidt served Cornell for thirty-six years, carrying a high teaching load in addition to this extensive research. He taught an elementary course in Hebrew each year. Advanced Hebrew covered the leading writers of the Old Testament and some parts of the Mishnaic and other Talmudic literature in three years. General linguistics students were advised to begin their study of Semitic languages with Arabic, also offered each year. Aramaic and Egyptian alternated with Assyrian and Ethiopic. The Semitic Seminary, given one term each year, was dedicated to epigraphical studies. Schmidt used the lecture format extensively. His lectures on Semitic literature were devoted to discourse on authorship, dating, literary composition and historical value. The lectures also focused on translation and elucidation of Semitic texts. The Old Testament was central to his syllabus, allowing familiarization with scientific Bible-study. Also integrated into the syllabus were the Hebrew apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Quran, the Arabic poets, the Babylonian Gilgamish epic and the Book of the Dead. He also lectured on Semitic history, divided into treatments of Babylonia, Assyria, Persia, India, Armenia, Syria, Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the Spanish Caliphate. Schmidt's linguistic ability was prodigious. Courses followed in Hebrew (including composition, as well as a focus on Genesis, Ruth and Esther); Arabic (including selections from prose writers, poets, and the Qur√¢n); Advanced Arabic (featuring early suras in the Quran, and the Prolegomena (al-Muqaddimah) of Ibn Khaldun); Ethiopic (focused on the Liber Baruch in Dillmann's Chrestomathia Aethiopica, the Book of Enoch and a study of Ethiopian manuscripts); Assyrian (using selections from Meissner's Chrestomathie, Delitzsch's Leestuecke, and Rawlinson's Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia); Aramaic (focusing on the Gospel of Matthew in the Sinaitic Syriac, the Curetonian Fragments, the Peshitta, and the Evangeliarium Hierosolymitanum, inscriptions in the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, and the Elephantine Papyri); Egyptian (reading the Hieroglyphic texts and squeezes of the Eisenlohr collection); Coptic (using selections from the Gospels and from Pistis Sophia); Semitic Literature (a general introduction to the Bible, including the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha; the course was a brief compass on the results of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, date, composition, and character of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures); Semitic Seminary (study of the Syriac Odes of Soloman, and of the Hebrew text coming from the Ciovenanters of Damascus); Comparative Semitic Philology (a study of morphological and syntactical peculiarities of the Aramaic dialects, including interpretation for purposes of comparison, of texts in Mandaic, Babylonian Talmudic, ancient and modern Syriac, Galilaean, Samaritan and Judean Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Nabataean); Oriental History (Schmidt's introduction to the history of Asia, designed to acquaint the student with the civilizations of the Orient; sources, methods of study, and contemporary problems; the epochs, leading figures, and chief institutions. The history of Asia Minor, Syria, Arabia, Iraq, Iran, India, China, Japan, Central Asia, and Asiatic Russia was presented in outline); Oriental History II (This course was an introduction to the history of Africa, including the histories of Ancient Egypt, Libya and the Cyrenaica, Carthage, Mauritania, Nubia, Ethiopia, and the various Egyptian and Maghrebite Caliphates will be presented in outline; the growth of European influence in Modern Africa was also traced). Schmidt's efforts reached a large general audience within the Cornell student body. Subsequent accomplishments of his Cornell students gained the university recognition as an Orientalist center. In 1900, Schmidt placed Cornell University as one of the twenty-one charter members of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. Schmidt's year (AY1904‚Äì05) in Jerusalem found him doing pioneer archaeology survey and mapping and archaeological expeditions in the Negev Desert and Dead Sea regions. His academic knowledge of the region, its topography and its languages allowed the expedition to gain access to remote regions. The party was, at one point, attacked by a Bedouin war party, and held captive. During the 1902 summer recess, Schmidt was informed that the Egyptological and Assyriological collection of the University of Heidelberg's August Eisenlohr was for sale through Leipzig bookseller Gustav Fock. Schmidt canvassed University leadership and built enough consensus that they devoted the entire balance of $617 from the 1901-02 book budget to this purpose. The $2000 remainder was to come from the AY1902‚Äì03 budget. Thus Cornell acquired the most important Egyptological collection marketed since the death of Karl Richard Lepsius. The Eisenlohr collection contained about 900 volumes on Egypt and Assyria. Cornell's collection of Egyptian papyri was started in March 1889 with a gift by former President Andrew Dickson White. Donated the year before the founding of Cornell's Sphinx Head Society, the magnificent scroll contains a vignette from the Book of the Dead and was written in a combination of hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts. Long thought to be a spell from the Book of the Dead, the text is actually a Ptolemaic funerary scroll, dating from around 330-30 BCE.Cornell website The long roll, mounted and framed, hung for many years over the main entrance of Uris Library. White purchased it for the equivalent of about $125 from the Cairo dealer in furniture and antiquities L. Philip, during the trip to Egypt that White made in the winter of 1888-89 in company with Willard Fiske. White was careful to collect documentation on the papyrus, including information on when it had been discovered, and a photograph of the tomb and the mummy with which the papyrus roll had been found. Before the purchase White had the piece taken to the Egyptologist Emil Brugsch-Bey of the Egyptian Museum for examination and authentication. Based on this report White was able to describe his purchase in a letter of March 15, 188, to University President Charles Kendall Adams: > Most prominent among the illustrations is that of the 125th chapter, > representing the dead man standing before Osirus while the god Arubus weighs > his heart in one scale of the great balance against the image of the Goddess > of Truth in the other. Above sit the 42 avenging deities or Jurors, and > below the four funereal genii, etc. etc. ... It is really a fine specimen-- > complete in itself--and the only such a present on the market--the one at > Luxor having been bought, it is supposed by Krupp of Essen. Cornell adding many more documents to this collection over the course of the next seventy-five years. But after the downturn in the university's finances following overspending in the 1960s, the collection was donated to an institution with the funds necessary to conserve the collection. In January 1972, Cornell gave away all but the Andrew Dickson White Papyrus, the Ptolemaic funerary text. Schmidt worked closely with J. R. S. Sterrett, who was elected head of Cornell's Department of Greek in 1901. Sterrett was an archaeologist, notably active in Asia Minor. He discovered and translated ancient inscriptions fixed the topography of cities, rivers and states. Sterrett was \\"a man of very conservative views, of extremely rigorous, even stoical ideal of duty.\\" He planned and organized the 1907-08 Cornell Expedition to Asia Minor and the Assyro-Babylonian Orient. Aiding him was one of Nathaniel Schmidt's most promising students, Albert T. Olmstead. Olmstead \\"led an ascetic little group through wide ranges of the Turkish Empire--almost literally on foot.\\" Sterrett announced their discovery of a new corpus of Hittite inscriptions. Schmidt took a sabbatical leave of absence during AY 1904-1905 to serve as the director, American School of Archeology at Jerusalem. During his time in Jerusalem, Schmidt conducted archaeological sites examinations at Qudeirat and determined that it was not the Old Testament's Kadesh. He thought the ruins of Petra were a closer fit with the descriptions of Kadesh. On the trip, Schmidt considered Weibeh, Kades and Qudeirah. He rejected them all and concluded that Kadesh was at Petra: \\"It seems to me even more probable that Petra was the original scene of these stories.\\"Kadesh Barnea, Nathan Schmidt, Kadesh Barnea, Journal 29 of Biblical Literature (1910) at 75-76; see also Ein El-Qudeirat, Fortress of Solomon 950 BC But Cannot Be Kadesh Barnea. Schmidt's archaeological interests continued back in Ithaca. During AY 1928‚Äì29 and 1929‚Äì30, he secured for Cornell's Babylonian collection cuneiform tablets from Henry Patten of Chicago, and in the second year, an assortment of some twenty-six artifacts dating to 4000 BC. from John Randolph of Rhode Island.\\"Cornell Gets Collection; Earliest Glass Said to Be Included Among Babylonian Relics,\\" The New York Times (June 1, 1930). The cuneiform tablets were little used for many years and are now decaying. In AY1974‚Äì75, Professor D. I. Owen reintroduced Akkadian to the syllabus and that sparked some new interest in the collection. Otherwise, they may join the Cornell papyri now at the University of Michigan. Cornell University Professor Nathaniel Schmidt, foreground, illustrated in a fanciful drawing by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as destroying some of the \\"cherished ideals\\" of their time (1911), including, from left to right, \\"Mother Love,\\" \\"Dependent Wife,\\" the man as \\"Head of the Family,\\" and the \\"Independent Old Maid.\\" Cracks have already begun to appear in some of the columns, and the one on the left is collapsing. During the summer recesses, Schmidt taught and gave lectures across the country. In June 1899, he lectured for the Brotherhood of the Kingdom at their seventh annual conference in Marlborough, New York. The University of Wisconsin invited him to teach Oriental History and Hellenistic Philosophy in June 1909, as one of their summer school faculty. From 1925 to 1935 he taught at Columbia University's summer school. Beginning in 1910, Schmidt was Chairman, Department of Oriental Languages and Literature, Cornell University and the next year (1911), he joined the effort to save Egyptian antiquities from scheduled flooding by the completion of the Aswan dam.\\"Archaeologists in Need; Join in Appeal for Money to Hasten Excavations in Assouan Dam Region,\\" The New York Times (March 18, 1911). In 1914 he served as president of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis.The Leading Citizens of Madison County (Madison County, NY and Ingalls Family) at link. He spent significant periods working overseas, notably as Director, American School of Archaeology, Jerusalem (1904‚Äì05) and Director of the Archaeology Institute of Jerusalem (1923). Schmidt also served as Editor, Ecclesiasticus; President, American Oriental Society and Trustee, American Schools of Oriental Research in Jerusalem and Baghdad. = Decline of orientalism = In retirement, Schmidt and his wife spent winters in Florida. Schmidt continued to write and served as a visiting lecturer, Princeton University, during the summer of 1938.Shepard, Schmidt Die, Cornell Alumni News (July 1939) at 446‚Äì47. For many years he was also an associate lecturer for the Society for Ethical Culture.Who's Who in New York City and New York State (John W. Leonard, ed.)(1909) at 1150. As Schmidt approached retirement age in the late 1920s, Robert M. Ogden, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, evinced concern over the future of the Semitics Department. These were years of decline in Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences. When Schmidt retired in 1932, no plan existed to preserve this university scholarly tradition. Even after the end of the Second World War, a further decade passed without the restoration of courses in Semitic studies. In the mid-1950s, Professor Milton R. Konvitz revived the study of Semitics through the Danforth Foundation's support for a professorship of Biblical and Hebrew Studies. Isaac Rabinowitz, an authority on Biblical literature and particularly the Dead Sea Scrolls, was appointed professor in 1957.The New York Times In 1965, the Department of Semitic Languages and Literature was created. Rabinowitz was its first Chairman. A succession of Arabists was appointed, starting with Professor A. L. Udovitch. This development coincided with a return to the field. In 1958, Cornell and Harvard teamed up to form the Cornell-Harvard Expedition to Sardis, under the aegis of the American Schools of Oriental Research. The project continues a half century later, with a number of Cornell faculty members being involved. Cornell's participation was the result of the interest of Professor A. Henry Detweiler, College of Art and Architecture and associate director of the Expedition from 1958 to 1970. Before joining the Cornell faculty in 1939, Detweiler spent the previous decade working at Gerasa, Samaria, Dura, Seleucia, Isfahan, and other ancient sites in Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Iran, etc. = Legacy = After the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1968‚Äì1973, the shape of Cornell Semitic studies began to evolve into area studies with the areas defined in new ways. These were exciting years. In 1971, Benzion Netanyahu and brothers Yonathan and Iddo moved to Ithaca to be the new professor of Judaic Studies and chairman of the revived Department of Semitic Languages and Literatures. The department established a new Jewish Studies major in the years following the curtailment of discrimination against Jews by the University between Felix Adler dismissal and the mid-1960s.Ellen Tumposky, \\"Jewish Studies Major Initiated,\\" Cornell Daily Sun (88:103)(March 8, 1972) at 2. Netanyahu offered courses in Jewish history and modern Hebrew literature. AY1972 saw two new professors join the department, one specializing in Hebrew language and another in modern Hebrew literature. Netanyahu taught the year-long survey of Jewish history from 614 BC. until the Six- Day War of 1968. Like Schmidt, Netanyahu thought knowledge of a people's history was essential to understanding of its literature. Courses were once again taught in classical and modern Hebrew, Aramaic, the Bible, Jewish religious and philosophical thought, and Hebrew literature from the postbiblical period to the present. Like Schmidt, Netanyahu thought Judaic civilization, no less than Greek and Roman, merits comprehensive and thorough treatment. Cornell saw a rise in Semitic studies during the early 1970s, the number of students enrolled rising from 127 to 313. Netanyahu taught in the department through the Yom Kippur War, even as this three sons returned to carry arms in defense of the State of Israel. The family made many friends during those brief four years, Cornellians heartbroken with the eldest brother, Yonathan, died freeing hostages abducted by terrorists in 1977. The Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu Memorial Fund for Jewish Studies still supports the enrichment of Cornell's Jewish Studies Program. Colonel Netanyahu, son of Benzion and brother to Benjamin and Iddo, was thirty years' old when he fell in command of the Entebbe raid on July 3, 1977. Netanyahu's team of commandos freed 103 hostages.\\"Fund Commemorates Israeli Army Hero,\\" Cornell Chronicle (Sept. 30, 1976) at 3. Politics Nathaniel Schmidt was a progressive Democrat, noted for his anti-imperialist and pacifist public positions. At this death, he was most remembered for his position on the need to democratize the League of Nations and the need to forgive war debts accumulated by European powers during the First World War. In the 1924 Presidential campaign, Schmidt broke from the Democratic Party and joined future New Dealers Rexford Tugwell and Felix Frankfurter in the political endorsement of Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette's attempt to create a national third party. The endorsement specific sought to advance the \\"neglected needs of farmers and city workers by hand and brain and others dependent up their earnings.\\"\\"3rd Party Endorsed by 300 Educators; Time is Ripe for Political Realignment Based on Economic Issues, They Say,\\" The New York Times (Oct. 22, 1924). With respect to foreign policy ‚Äì the field of great interest to Schmidt ‚Äì the La Follette-Wheeler platform sought to \\"diminish the danger of war by dealing resolutely with the economic causes leading to war, by reducing armaments, by working for the outlawry of war by international agreement and by placing responsibility for making war directly on the conscience of the people. In 1900, he delivered an address before the State Conference on Religion at All Soul's Church in Manhattan. On the issue of war and imperialism, Schmidt noted, \\"[w]hether the State seeks to expand by conquest, maintain its independence in single combat with its rivals,or guard its interests through offensive and defensive alliances, there must be war and preparations for war. But war is such a clumsy expression of tribal justice and such a fruitful source of corruption that in spite of its apparent necessity the marked individualism and the deep moral sense of the prophets of Israel could not allow it a permanent place in their political ideal.\\"\\"Conference of Religion; A Crowded Evening Session in All Soul's Church,\\" The New York Times (Nov. 22, 1900). His philosophy tended towards Christian socialism, as described in his 1903 address at the Cooper Union entitled \\"The Republic of Man\\". The ideas in \\"The Republic of Man\\" were in circulation as early as November 1899. Schmidt gave a lecture on the \\"Political Ideas of the Bible, Old Testament\\" at the New York State Conference of Religion. The Conference followed from the National Congress of Religions and the Parliament of Religions held at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. The goal was to bridge differences between Jewish and Christian beliefs.\\"Conference on Religion,\\" The New York Times (Nov. 21, 1900). In the 1903 lecture, Professor Schmidt noted that man as a species began in a state of cannibalism, developed into an enslaver, then reasoned itself into understanding slavery to be a wrong, and would soon see armaments escalation in the same manner. In the global initiative occurring then at The Hague, he saw ‚Äì like Alfred Hayes, Jr. ‚Äì the emergence of a \\"Parliament of mankind.\\" That parliament would settle, once and for all, the question of warfare. Schmidt also saw the new world institution as a means of redistributing wealth and compensation of offset the inclinations of the free market.\\"Hewitt in Cooper Union; Prof. Schmidt of Cornell Talks of International Disarmament and Predicts the 'Parliament of Man,'\\" The New York Times (Feb. 2, 1903). This remained his position for the next three decades. As late as 1928, he was a support of the Institute of World Unity and its annual summer school at Eliot, Maine.\\"To Discuss World Unity; Summer School of Institute Opens Tomorrow at Eliot, Me.,\\" The New York Times (July 29, 1928). After the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Schmidt's pacifism and anti-imperialism was less well received by the American public. His speech before the Political Equality League of Chicago brought hisses after he turned to a critique of British imperial conscription policy. Schmidt found the policy of drafting disenfranchised peoples repugnant, and all the more problematic when justified upon matters of race. In the Chicago speech, he went as far as denying the existence of race. The crowd was partially receptive to the egalitarian aspects of the message. The hissing became more pronounced during the pacifist themes.\\"Hiss Attack on England; Chicago Audience Hostile to Talk by Professor Schmidt of Cornell,\\" The New York Timess (March 3, 1918). When Theodore Roosevelt's growing authoritarianism prompted him to advise British Imperial officials in Cairo, Egypt to curtail the free speech rights of the Egyptian nationalists, Schmidt denounced Roosevelt's actions as counterproductive to world peace. Before the Chicago Association, Schmidt noted there were ways to deal \\"... more tactfully with those numerous questions which go to make peace between nations than did an ex-President of the United States who spoke in Cairo the other day. The speech was rather uncalled for, I think. Now, a German would say that Mr. Roosevelt was just right. It is the German policy to lay down the law, and if necessary to lay on the lash. They would think it wholly proper that he should tell the Egyptians how to manage their affairs ... I think the truth is that the English policy of pouring money into the country and developing it commercially, and at the same time allowing extreme freedom of speech, is the best one in the long run.\\"Roosevelt is Criticised; Prof. Schmidt Says His Cairo Speech Was Uncalled For,\\" The New York Times (March 31, 1910). On the eve of the First World War and at a time when Ottoman imperial control over its Syria provinces was weakening (see also Ottoman Syria and Partition of the Ottoman Empire), Schmidt was an early proponent of an independent, secular Syrian republic. Addressing the Eastern Council of Reformed Rabbis at the Temple Emanu-El on the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, he appealed to Reformed Jews to lead the West in establishing such a secular State centered on Damascus. He cautioned that the significant Muslim and Christian Syrian populations would probably prevent the creation of a Jewish state based on a Syrian option, but a democratic multi-interest republic could succeed through the Chinese model of 1912. Critical to the success of the endeavor, said Schmidt, was the establishment of a secular education system for all.\\"Republic in Syria Urged Upon Rabbis,\\" The New York Times (May 5, 1913).

Times (Jan. 8, 1923). (see Armenian Genocide). In a speech sponsored by the Brooklyn Ethical Culture Society, he advocated self-rule by the Turks and free international trade through the Dardanelles. Ottoman/Turkish abuses of ethnic and religious minorities were thought to be correctable through greater education of its peoples and elites. In October 1935, Schmidt spoke out against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Joining Bishop William T. Manning at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and a call for the United States to 'decide whether it will join with other nations 'in police action for the preservation of peace.'\\" Schmidt's subsequent address at the Society for Ethical Culture note that \\"... whatever the outcome of the situation may be, there will follow a period of moral deterioration. Whether Ethiopia is conquered in a short or in a long drawn-out war, whether by the grace of the great military powers Ethiopia is preserved at the cost of her economic integrity, or whether by her courage and strength Ethiopia maintains her independence, moral deterioration of the peoples involved is unavoidable.\\"\\"Italy Denounced in Pulpits Here; Bishop Manning Says Nation Forgets Law of God and Her Own Honor,\\" The New York Times (Oct. 7, 1935). Three years later, Schmidt offered an assessment of the Japanese aggression against the Republic of China in terms which connected the capacity to wage an unjust war to the disconnectedness between a people and its government.\\"Hopes Japan Will 'Repent'; Prof. Schmidt Urges Good Will Toward Both Nations,\\" The New York Times (Jan. 3, 1938).

Life According to The Transmission of the Lamp Little independent information about the life of Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ exists outside of The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp, a hagiographic account of the lives of early Indian and Chinese masters in the Chan tradition. Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ was from a Brahmin family in eastern India and was orphaned at a young age. Without a family name, Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ was called 'Precious Necklace' or 'Keyura' before ordination. When the 26th Patriarch, Punyamitra, came to visit the king of Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ's region, Punyamitra stopped the king's carriage on seeing Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ bowing. Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ was identified as having been Punyamitra's student in a previous incarnation, and Punyamitra identified Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ as an incarnation of the Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta. Punyamitra confirmed Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ as his Dharma-successor and then passed away. After receiving the Dharma, Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ traveled to southern India and encountered Bodhidharma, then living as the youngest son of a king called Excelling in Fragrance. Before passing away at the age of sixty-seven, Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ instructed Bodhidharma to travel to China to spread the Dharma. At death, Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ ascended into the sky and burst into flame, raining down relics on devotees below. The Denkoroku by Keizan Jokin Zenji relates the following k≈çan, a legendary exchange between Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ and Bodhidharma. The Transmission of the Lamp records several prophecies attributed to Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ by later Chinese patriarchs. Among them were the prediction of a great calamity during the time of Bodhidharma's heirs Huike and Sengcan that supposedly motivated them to take refuge in the mountains in order to avoid persecutions of Buddhism carried out by the emperor between 574‚Äì77. Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ supposedly also predicted the emergence of Mazu Daoyi and the spread of Chan Buddhism throughout China. Gender While Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ has generally been assumed to be male and is listed among the Chan Patriarchs (all of whom are male), 20th Century Buddhist practitioners have suggested that Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ might have been a woman.Who Was Prajnatara? The ordination name Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ combines the names of two female Buddhist deities or Bodhisattva, Prajnaparamita and Tara. In 2008, Rev. Koten Benson suggested that Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ might have been a woman and was the head of the Sarvastivadin order. He claims that oral traditions in Kerala and the Korean Seon tradition identify Praj√±ƒÅtƒÅrƒÅ as female, and that archaeological evidence from southern India confirms the existence of famous female teachers. Reactions to this theory by mainstream Buddhist scholars have ranged from outright dismissal to an acknowledgement that it could be possible. Classical Chinese texts do not always denote gender, and in the absence of explicit gender designations an entry in the list of Dharma successors might be presumed to be male. While less information regarding female teachers has generally been retained by the tradition, the equality of women in spiritual matters was affirmed by the Buddha, and the Chan tradition has a history of female teachers.

The film won critical acclaim, but failed to become a commercially successful venture. Soon afterwards, he made Devathai (1997), stating he remembered a story he had first heard as a child, which became the \\"creative seed for this film\\" about reincarnation. He stated that his immediate busy schedule had subsequently cost him a role in Aamir Khan's Lagaan (2001). He subsequently continued to work in films in the late 1990s, portraying a blind musician in Rajiv Menon's Minsara Kanavu (1997), a political leader in Mani Ratnam's Iruvar (1997) and as the father of a pair of separated twins in S.

Bruckman collaborated with such comedians as Buster Keaton, W. C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, and Harold Lloyd. Early life Clyde Adolf Bruckman was born on June 30, 1894 in San Bernardino, California. In 1911, Bruckman's father Rudolph was in a car accident that left him with headaches and brain damage. Rudolph shot himself in 1912. Bruckman began writing for the sports pages of the San Bernardino Sun in the spring of 1912. In 1914, he moved to Los Angeles and got a job as a sportswriter for the Los Angeles Times. He later worked for the Los Angeles Examiner and the Saturday Evening Post. On July 29, 1916, Bruckman married Lola Margaret Hamilton. Career Joe Mitchell, Clyde Bruckman, Buster Keaton, Jean Havez and Eddie Cline (1923) Bruckman first worked in film in 1919, writing intertitles for Universal Pictures. In 1921, he moved to Warner Brothers and began writing gags for Buster Keaton. Bruckman (pronounced \\"Brook-man\\") may be best known for his collaborations with Buster Keaton, as Bruckman co-wrote several of Keaton's most popular films, including Our Hospitality, Sherlock Jr., The Navigator, Seven Chances, The Cameraman, and The General, which Bruckman also co-directed. He also directed four Laurel and Hardy comedies in the early stages of their established partnership at the Hal Roach Studios in 1927‚Äì1928, most notably The Battle of the Century with its celebrated custard pie fight. Bruckman continued directing comedies during the sound era, his most famous credit being The Fatal Glass of Beer, W. C. Fields' esoteric satire of Yukon melodramas. Unfortunately for his career path, Bruckman's fondness for alcohol caused production delays that cost him directorial assignments. From 1935 forward, Bruckman would be limited to writing scripts.  Recycling gags  Bruckman's wealth of silent-comedy experience earned him a steady position in Columbia Pictures' short-subject department (Bruckman was instrumental in Columbia's hiring his old boss Buster Keaton in 1939). Bruckman continued to write new material for The Three Stooges and other comics, but as time went by, he resorted to borrowing gags from Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton's silent films. After Bruckman lifted the magician's-coat sequence from Lloyd's Movie Crazy for The Three Stooges' Loco Boy Makes Good, and the \\"loosely basted tuxedo\\" routine from Lloyd's The Freshman for the Stooges' Three Smart Saps, Lloyd sued Columbia and won. \\"Never mind that Bruckman had co-written and co-directed Movie Crazy, giving him a pretty strong claim to intellectual ownership of the routine, or that Bruckman and Lloyd may very well have borrowed their ideas from a vaudeville act in the first place\\", wrote Ethan Gates in The New Republic, reviewing Matthew Dessem's 2015 biography of Bruckman, The Gag Man. One example of Bruckman's constant recycling is a routine involving the comedian thinking he is boxed-in while trying to leave a parallel parking space. The routine was used at least four times by Bruckman: with Lloyd Hamilton in Too Many Highballs (1933); W. C. Fields in Man on the Flying Trapeze (1935); Buster Keaton in Nothing But Pleasure (1940); and an episode of The Abbott and Costello Show called Car Trouble (1954). Bruckman was hired by Universal Pictures to write comedy scenes for the studio's \\"B\\" musical features. This was a lucrative assignment that paid better than short subjects. He continued recycling gags but on a larger scale, now lifting entire sequences from older films. He inserted the tuxedo routine into Universal's \\"B\\" musical-comedy feature Her Lucky Night. Bruckman adapted material from Lloyd's Welcome Danger into Universal's Joan Davis‚ÄìLeon Errol comedy She Gets Her Man, and again consulted Movie Crazy for Universal's \\"B\\" comedy So's Your Uncle. Lloyd, outraged by three \\"wholesale infringements\\" within months, filed suit for US$1,700,000;\\"Lloyd Film Firm Sues For $1,815,000: Charges Universal Co. With Infringement of Copyrights on Three Pictures\\". The New York Times 5 Apr 1945: 26. the court ruled for Lloyd but granted damages of $40,000. Bruckman was fired, and never worked on a feature film again. Demoralized, he returned to Columbia, where his work was now so slipshod that he would simply hand in an old script, without any attempt at updating or revising it.  The 1950s  The advent of television, and its constant need for broadcast material, gave Bruckman a new start. Abbott and Costello launched a filmed television series in 1951. Having used up most of their own familiar routines during the show's first season, the comedians hired Clyde Bruckman, and his mental storehouse of gags saw them through a second season. Although Bruckman received credit for several scripts, these turned out to contain reworkings of old Keaton and Lloyd gags. Again, Lloyd filed suit, naming Abbott & Costello's production company as a party to the suit. As a result, other producers were unwilling to hire Bruckman. Bruckman's only safe haven was Columbia, but producer Jules White had already filled his quota of scripts for that season, and had no immediate need for Bruckman's services. Death With nowhere else to turn, the desolate Bruckman borrowed a .45-caliber pistol from Buster Keaton, claiming to need it for a hunting trip. On the afternoon of January 4, 1955, Bruckman, a resident of Santa Monica, California, parked his car outside a local restaurant, entered a restroom and shot himself in the head.Variety, January 6, 1955, Clyde Bruckman Obituary Some reports claim the location was Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, but according to his January 5 obituary, it was in the city of Santa Monica, and Bruckman left a typewritten note for the \\"gentlemen of the Santa Monica Police Department.\\" Neither Jules White nor Buster Keaton had any inkling of Bruckman's intentions. Personal life Bruckman married first wife Lola in 1916. She died after complications from emergency surgery on October 8, 1931. He was married to his second wife, Gladys, from March 1932 until his death.Thedissolve.com They had no children.  Cultural references  The X-Files Season 3 episode \\"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\\" features a character, played by Peter Boyle, who foresees how other people die. Two detective characters on that episode are named Havez and Cline, after Jean Havez and Eddie Cline, two other writers who also worked with Buster Keaton. As with his real-life namesake, Boyle's Bruckman character kills himself.

Many of Havalina's releases were regional concept albums. According to the band's website, the band's name was inspired by the song \\"Havalina\\" by the Pixies. Havalina was active from 1992 through 2005. Havalina played their last show on March 17, 2005 at The Gypsy Lounge. Former members of Havalina are now involved in Matt Death and the New Intellectuals, Os and the Oculist, Starmob and Wargirl. History The group was founded in Long Beach, California in 1992. Havalina Rail Co. released their self-titled debut album through Tooth & Nail Records in 1994. The album contains 19 tracks of rockabilly, folk, swing and zydeco. This was the only album released by the band that wasn't a concept album. In an interview for KPSU, Wignall commented that the first album was \\"this sort of finding our path and gravitating towards American sounds.\\" Their second album, The Diamond in the Fish, released in 1996, was a concept album telling the story of a retired secret agent. The album was filled with Rat Pack-style jazz, filtered through folk and blues. About Diamond in the Fish, Wignall said, \\"We were experimenting with idea of like playing jazz, which incidentally, we kinda sucked at. And found out why most of the time all good jazz players are over fifty, 'cause it takes that long to get good at it.\\" The band independently released Russian Lullabies through Wignall's Jackson/Rubio label. This was the band's attempt to produce Eastern European music without actually listening to Eastern European music, then making a pop music sound from that. The album is long out of print, however, Wignall uploaded the album to the band's website for free download. Wignall described America as \\"a musical road trip around America with the idea being to show our influences and what we like about American music while kinda re-defining the ideas if we had been there and done it our own way\\".

Known as Purfleet until 2003, the club played at Ship Lane. History Originally being founded as Essex Sports in 1984, the club was renamed to Purfleet in April 1985, in order to play senior football, and entered the Reserve Division of the Essex Senior League in 1985 and spent one season in that division before joining the first-team league. After finishing third and winning the league cup in their first season, they won the league and cup double in 1987‚Äì88, earning promotion to Division Two North of the Isthmian League. They finished as runners-up in their first season and were promoted to Division One. However, the following season they were relegated back to Division Two North after finishing second from bottom. In 1991‚Äì92 the club won the division, and were promoted to Division One. Two seasons later they finished second, and were promoted to the Premier Division. In 2003 the club changed its name to Thurrock, and after finishing third in the league at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, in which they also won the league cup and the Essex Senior Cup, became founder members of the Conference South. In the club's first season in the new league, they qualified for the promotion play- offs but were knocked out by Eastbourne Borough. However, they did win the Essex Senior Cup for a second successive season. In 2008‚Äì09 the club finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Team Bath resigned from the league. In 2010‚Äì11 the club again finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Rushden & Diamonds were expelled from the Conference National league hence Southport were not relegated from the Conference National. Thurrock announced manager Robbie Garvey resigned following the club's defeat against fellow Conference strugglers Staines Town on 5 December 2011. Lee Goodwin and Grant Gordon took charge of the team on a match by match basis until a new manager was appointed. Thurrock were relegated at the end of the season, finishing bottom of the Conference South. In 2012‚Äì13, they initially finished 19th in the Isthmian Premier, two spots above relegation, but then had three points controversially deducted for fielding an ineligible player, dropping them to last place and thus relegating them to Division One North of the Isthmian League. The three points were deducted after the season ended despite the offence taking place in August leading to a protracted legal dispute. 2013‚Äì14 saw Thurrock fall short of the play-offs on the very last game of the season. A 2‚Äì1 defeat to Tilbury combined with Needham Market beating Chatham Town 7‚Äì1 saw Needham Market take the last play-off place on goal difference. Thurrock went one better in 2014‚Äì15 finishing in fifth place. They went on to beat Harlow Town 4‚Äì3 after extra time in the play-off semi final but were beaten 5‚Äì0 by Brentwood Town in the final. In 2015-2016 Thurrock once more made the play-offs taking league runners-up position but were beaten 2‚Äì0 by AFC Hornchurch in the play-off semi final. 2016-2017 saw Thurrock make it three play-offs in a row as they finished 3rd gaining promotion to the Isthmian League Premier division by beating both AFC Hornchurch and Maldon & Tiptree 1‚Äì0. On 27 August 2017, chairman Tommy South announced that due to health reasons he would be selling Thurrock and stepping down at the end of the 2017/18 season. With no buyer forthcoming Thurrock formally resigned from the Isthmian League on 31 March 2018. Thurrock won their last home game at Ship Lane on 21 April 2018 against Kingstonian F.C. and lost their final competitive fixture away to Staines Town on 28 April 2018. They finished 15th in the 2017‚Äì18 Isthmian League. Stadium The club played at Ship Lane since their establishment in April 1985 until the end in 2018. At first the ground was a part of the Thurrock Hotel complex, and initially consisted of two pitches and dressing rooms in the main hotel building. Due to this set-up the club could only compete at Junior level. The playing area was turned around 90¬∞ to make one full pitch and dressing rooms were built so the club could become a separate entity. Floodlights were erected in January 1988 after planning permission was accepted from Thurrock Council to add these features as well as a grandstand.

Together with pacifism, it is born from the Western tradition or attitude that calls for peace. The former involves the unconditional refusal to support war or absolute pacifism, while pacificism views the prevention of war as its duty but recognizes the controlled use of armed force to achieve such objective. According to Martin Caedel, pacificism or a pacificist conduct is driven by a certain political position or ideology such as liberalism, socialism or feminism.  Development  Pacifism ranges between total pacifism, which usually states that killing, violence or war is unconditionally wrong in all cases, and defensivism, which accepts all defensive wars and acts of deterrence as morally just.Western Herald - Pacifism cannot hold up under scrutiny Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm \\"last resort\\", condemning both aggression and militarism. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form. The term pacificism was first used in 1910 by William James. The distinct theory was later developed by A. J. P. Taylor in The Trouble-Makers (1957)‚ÄòBy ‚Äòpacificism‚Äô I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by ‚Äòpacifism‚Äô (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrine of non-resistance.

Formed in 1987 after the Army took over responsibility for operating helicopters from the Royal Australian Air Force, the regiment is based at RAAF Base Townsville, in Queensland. It currently forms part of the 16th (Aviation) Brigade and it operates the majority of the Army's transport helicopters. Throughout its existence, the regiment has been deployed overseas numerous times, supporting both peacekeeping and warlike operations. Since its formation elements of the regiment have made operational deployments to Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, Iraq, Indonesia and Pakistan. History The 5th Aviation Regiment was formed at Townsville, Queensland, on 20 November 1987 to operate the S-70A-9 Black Hawk and UH-1 Iroquois helicopters which had previously been operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) following the decision to transfer these assets to the Australian Army. In 1989, No. 9 Squadron RAAF (S-70A) became the regiment's 'A' Squadron and No. 35 Squadron RAAF (UH-1) became 'B' Squadron. 'B' Squadron was later re-equipped with Black Hawks. The regiment was subsequently expanded in 1995 when 'C' Squadron was formed to operate CH-47 Chinook and UH-1 Iroquois helicopters (the later in the aerial fire support role). In May 1993 six Black Hawks and 109 personnel from 'B' Squadron were deployed to Battambang airport in north-west Cambodia, forming the Army Aviation Group deployed in support of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in that country. The aircraft were painted in UN white and fitted with armour plating and door mounted machine- guns for the operation due to the threat of ground fire. They were subsequently used to resupply UN positions along the Thai-Laos border, as well as the transportation of electoral officials and ballot boxes, and for aeromedical evacuation. The helicopters were fired on at least three times, with one receiving minor damage from small arms fire. They returned to Townsville in July 1993. On the evening of 12 June 1996 two Black Hawk helicopters from the regiment carrying soldiers from the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) collided during an exercise at the High Range Training Area near Townsville. The activity took place sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use night vision goggles. Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the landing zone, one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the tail rotor of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames. Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Meanwhile, the Iroquois helicopters were transferred to the 1st Aviation Regiment in 1998. In September 1999, the regiment deployed 12 Black Hawks as part of the Australian-led International Force East Timor (INTERFET), flying directly into Dili from Darwin on the second day of the operation to provide airlift and limited aerial fire support to the force on the ground. The detachment was initially based at the Dili Heliport, but was redeployed to Balibo in July 2000 following the transition to the UN mission. In April 2002 it moved again, this time to Moleana. By 2004 the regiment provided a 24-hour aeromedical evacuation capability in support of the Australian infantry battalion deployed along the East Timor-Indonesian border, as well as the insertion and extraction of reaction forces. Between March and May 2003, a detachment from 'C' Squadron of three CH-47 Chinooks supported the Special Forces Task Group provided airlift to other coalition forces as part of the Australian force deployed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In late 2003, 'A' Squadron and the UH-1 equipped 171st Squadron swapped designations, with the former 'A' Squadron becoming an independent squadron supporting Special Operations Command. The 'new' (UH-1 equipped) 'A' Squadron was subsequently re-equipped with 12 MRH-90 medium helicopters, while it was planned that 'B' Squadron would also be equipped with these aircraft by 2015. Following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, a detachment of Black Hawks were sent to Pakistan to assist the ADF medical team deployed there and provide humanitarian assistance to remote villages. Later, a detachment of two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the regiment was deployed to Afghanistan between late March 2006 and April 2007. In early 2008, two Chinooks were deployed with Rotary Wing Group 1 (RWG 1) and then again with Rotary Wing Group 2 (RWG 2) in June 2008 as part of Operation Slipper where they took part in combat operations. These operations continued in 2009 and 2010. Two years after being withdrawn, eight Black Hawks were deployed to East Timor in May 2006 as part of Operation Astute as a result of the deteriorating situation in the country. Three Black Hawks helped distribute aid to victims of flooding in Oro Province, Papua New Guinea in late 2007 as part of Operation Papua New Guinea Assist. On 30 May 2011, a Chinook from C Squadron crashed while operating in Afghanistan. The aircraft was conducting a re-supply mission in company with a US Army Chinook in Zabul Province when it crashed, injuring six personnel on board. The most seriously wounded, passenger Lieutenant Marcus Case, was evacuated by the accompanying US Army helicopter but later died of his injuries. He was an Australian Army pilot deployed with No. 5 Flight RAAF at Kandahar. The other five injured survived the crash and were evacuated to Kandahar. The helicopter, a CH-47D (ADF serial A15-102) attached to the US Army 159th Combat Aviation Brigade at Kandahar, was assessed as being unrecoverable and was subsequently destroyed at the site of the crash. There was no insurgent activity at the time of the crash, and enemy fire was ruled out as a contributing cause. The eleventh, and final, deployment of Chinooks to Afghanistan was completed on 14 September 2013. In June 2014, all six of the regiment's Chinooks flew together for the first time in 19 years. In August 2014, the regiment transferred the last of its Black Hawk helicopters to the 6th Aviation Regiment based at Holsworthy in Sydney. 'B' Squadron is replacing the type with MRH-90s, joining 'A' Squadron which has already re- equipped with the new helicopters. The regiment's six CH-47Ds were subsequently replaced by seven CH-47F models, with the last of the airframes being delivered in 2015. A further three CH-47F Chinooks were acquired in 2016.

Similar to the crissal and Le Conte's thrashers in habit, the California thrasher is the only species of Toxostoma throughout most of its limited range. Like most thrashers, it rarely flies in the open, preferring to keep hidden in dense brush. Therefore, while it is common throughout much of its range, it is rarely seen. At about and nearly , the California thrasher is the largest species of mimid. It has a distinctive long, decurved beak, and is generally brown, with buffy underparts and undertail (unlike the crissal). It has a dark cheek pattern and eye-line, and unlike most thrashers, has dark eyes. The California thrasher eats insects and small invertebrates, which it uncovers by tossing its beak in ground litter. References * Further reading =Books= * Cody, M. L. 1998.

Biography A Formal Sigh formed around the kernel of Mark Peters (bass guitar) and Flo Sullivan (vocals and keyboards). Robin Surtees (guitar) joined the pair within days. He was followed, after several auditions and temporary drummers, by Roger Sinek (drums) and Greg Milton (guitar and bass). Mark Peters had previously played with The Names (aka The Famous Names). The band recorded a session for John Peel on 5 September 1981, in the BBC Maida Vale 4 studio. Altered Images had been in the studio the day before. The Peel session was produced by Dale Griffin, ex- drummer of Mott the Hoople, and engineered by Mike Robinson. Peel was, in his own words, ‚Äòrather partial‚Äô to the tape and played it several times, beginning on 10 September 1981. The session was also broadcast several times on Radio Merseyside. A Formal Sigh were for a while the darlings of Merseysound, a high-quality Liverpool New Wave fanzine, and were featured twice on its cover. Apart from the Peel session, only two other sessions were recorded, 14‚Äì15 February 1981 and 6‚Äì7 March 1982, both engineered by Peter Coleman at Session One Studios in Liverpool. Merseysound released tracks from the first SOS session on its Tapezine. The track \\"Looking at Walls\\" appears to have been bootlegged a few times over the intervening years. More recently, the band has made all recordings available on CD: A Far Cry by A Formal Sigh. A Formal Sigh gigged regularly in Merseyside and the Northwest. In April 1982 a couple of record companies were just getting interested in signing the band when Flo Sullivan and Robin Surtees decided to leave. They went on to form Shiny Two Shiny. Flo later went solo as Gayna Rose Madder, and Robin joined members of The Room to form Benny Profane. Roger Sinek and Greg Milton reverted to their old band name, Barbel, and continued to play intermittently. Mark Peters emigrated to Australia. The band took its name from a quotation of Ned Rorem: ‚ÄòAn artist doesn't necessarily have deeper feelings than other people, but he can express these feelings. He is like everyone else-only more so! He speaks with a Formal Sigh.‚Äô Musical style A Formal Sigh was always hard to categorise. The female vocal format led some to make questionable comparisons with Siouxsie and the Banshees. Several tracks were redolent of U2. Material ranged from caustic observations of contemporary political situations (in tracks like \\"Bleak Intrusion\\" and \\"Ev Rev\\") to poignantly worded expos√©s of troubled relationships and anomie (\\"There is no Hell\\" and \\"Launderette\\") External links * The band's 13-track retrospective CD * Several images of the band Category:English rock music groups Category:Musical groups from Liverpool ","title":"A Formal Sigh"},{"id":"3674631","text":"SAP All-in-One is SAP's business software brand for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The most recent circa 1050 BC from a cone emerging from the northwest flank of the mountain at . The earlier eruption is dated from circa 3550 BC.  Etymology  Mount Y≈çtei is also known as Ezo Fuji because of its almost perfectly conical shape resembling Mt Fuji, making it one of the ‚Äúlocal Fujis‚Äù found in different regions of Japan. Through Japan's Meiji, Taish≈ç and Sh≈çwa eras it was known by multiple names: ‚ÄúShiribeshi-yama/K≈çh≈ç-Y≈çtei-zan\\", \\"Makkarinupuri\\" and \\"Ezo Fuji\\".

In the 50,000:1 scale topographical map of the ‚ÄúRusutsu‚Äù area published in 1920 by Japan‚Äôs Land Surveying Department, the mountain is recorded as \\"Shiribeshi-Y≈çtei-zan (Ezo-Fuji)\\". However, since the name was difficult to read, the town of Kutchan asked for it to be changed to Y≈çtei-zan. The change took place in the November 1969 topographical map published by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan. Since then, the current name of Y≈çtei-zan has become established. The mountain‚Äôs former title of ‚ÄúShiribeshi-Y≈çtei-zan‚Äù originates in the place-name of \\"Shiribeshi-Y≈çtei\\", which was recorded in the Nihon Shoki as the place where Abe no Hirafu established a domain in the article of May 17th in the year 659AD (Year 5 of the reign of Empress K≈çgyoku).

After spending much of their existence in the lower reaches of Non- League football, heavy financial investment by millionaire chairman-manager, Graham White, saw the club rise rapidly through the leagues in the late 1980s. However, upon winning the Northern Premier League championship in 1989‚Äì90, the club were refused promotion to the Football Conference having failed to meet ground grading conditions and were dissolved by White in the summer of 1990. History The club was formed by White in 1963 as team for former students of Primet High School. They initially played in the Nelson and Colne League and were based on a pitch at Holt House. After promotion through the local leagues the team moved from the old pitch to a spot on the current Holt House site. It was originally used for cricket, but after the council granted planning permission (which caused controversy with cricket enthusiasts) the club developed a stadium on the site. They joined the Lancashire Combination in 1975 and saw a sustained period of success, with seven consecutive top- seven finishes, including being runners-up three years in a row between 1980 and 1982. The club were founder members of the North West Counties League in 1982 and were placed in the Third Division. They won the division at the first attempt, and were promoted to the Division Two. By the mid-1980s White had become a millionaire through his property and timber business interests, and he began to invest money into the club. Following 12 clubs leaving the North West Counties League to form the Northern Premier League's new First Division, Colne were elevated to the First Division for the start of the 1987‚Äì88 despite only finishing 8th in the Second Division in the previous season. In the following season the club won the First Division championship on goal difference from Rossendale United, only losing three games and conceding 14 goals all season. They also won the FA Vase, beating Emley 1‚Äì0 in the Wembley final. As North West Counties League champions, the club were promoted to the First Division of the Northern Premier League. With more investment in the playing squad, including the signing of former Liverpool player Alan Kennedy, 1988‚Äì89 saw the club win the First Division with only a single defeat, and subsequent promotion to the Premier Division. In the summer of 1989 the club turned full-time, with some players earning more than those at Football League clubs.The Colne Dynamoes Debacle When Saturday Comes, May 2008, Issue 255 They won the Premier Division by a margin of 26 points with crowds averaging over 1,300,England ‚Äì Northern Premier League RSSSF and reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy where they lost to Conference side Barrow. Despite winning the NPL, the club was refused promotion to the Conference as their Holt House ground did not meet the required grading. White attempted to arrange a groundshare with Burnley (a club he had attempted to buy in 1989), reportedly offering them ¬£500,000 to play at Turf Moor, but was turned down. Following the rejection, plans were unveiled for a new stadium on the edge of neighbouring Nelson. However, following a pre-season friendly against Newcastle Blue Star in the summer of 1990, White told the players that the club was to fold. Following the Colne fiasco he quit football amidst allegations of death threats and that the money had run out. North West Counties League football returned to the town when Colne F.C. were founded and elected straight into the league in 1996, with the new club taking over the Holt House ground.

Egyptian raids and settlement They were raiders associated with the Eastern Mediterranean Dark Ages who attacked Egypt in 1207 BC in alliance with the Libyans and other Sea Peoples, as well as during the reign of Rameses III. The 20th Egyptian Dynasty allowed them to settle in Canaan, which was largely controlled by the Sea Peoples into the 11th century BC.

It was speculated that the Denyen had been taken to Egypt, and subsequently settled between the Caphtorite Philistines and the Tjekker, along the Mediterranean coast with the Tribe of Dan subsequently deriving from them.Mark W. Bartusch, Understanding Dan: an exegetical study of a biblical city, tribe and ancestor Volume 379 of Journal for the study of the Old Testament: Supplement series, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003 The most famous Danite was Samson, whom some suggest is derived from Denyen tribal legends.\\"Samson: the hero and the man : the story of Samson\\", Peter Lang, 2006. , . p. 278-282 References Category:Ancient peoples Category:History of Adana Category:Iron Age Greece Category:Mycenaean Greece Category:Sea Peoples ","title":"Denyen"},{"id":"3674729","text":"Bladnoch may refer to: * Bladnoch, Wigtownshire * Bladnoch Distillery, and Bladnoch whisky * River Bladnoch ","title":"Bladnoch"},{"id":"3674745","text":"ISOC Luxembourg logo The Luxembourg Chapter of the Internet Society is a part of the global Internet Society (ISOC) and is a not-for-profit organization.

Born and raised in Taiwan, she rose to fame in the early 2000s as a member of Taiwanese girl group S.H.E. The release of her debut album, To Hebe (2010), established her as a solo artist. Tien's song \\"A Little Happiness\\", the theme song of the 2015 Taiwanese film Our Times, was a major hit in most Mandarin-speaking parts of Asia.  Career  = S.H.E = On 8 August 2000, HIM International Music held a \\"Universal 2000 Talent and Beauty Girl Contest\\" in search of new artists to be signed onto their label. The staff of the TV show \\"Cruel Stage\\" encouraged Tien to participate in this televised competition. The contest had about 1,000 contestants, and after several rounds of competition, seven contestants remained for the final round. In the first round, Tien's voice began to crack while singing \\"Return Home\\". As a result, she decided to sing in a lower key in the final round, choosing Singaporean singer Kit Chan's \\"Loving You\\". However, because she was unfamiliar with the song, about ten seconds of the final lyrics went unsung. Following the competition, the Taiwanese record company gave all seven contestants an audition. The show's manager appreciated her straightforward personality and powerful vocals. As a result, Tien was invited to become a member of S.H.E, with Selina Jen‰ªªÂÆ∂Ëê± and Ella ChenÈôàÂòâÊ°¶, and was signed under the Taiwanese record label HIM International Music. = 2010‚Äì2012 = Following a very successful career with S.H.E, Tien debuted as a solo music artist in 2010 to similar success and critical acclaim for her music albums.

History The band formed in late 1969 upon the disbandment of Blind Faith. The original lineup consisted of Ginger Baker on drums, Steve Winwood on organ and vocals, Ric Grech on violin and bass, Jeanette Jacobs on vocals, Denny Laine on guitar and vocals, Phil Seamen on drums, Alan White on drums, Chris Wood on tenor sax and flute, Graham Bond on alto sax, Harold McNair on tenor sax and flute, and Remi Kabaka on percussion. Their first live shows, at Birmingham Town Hall in 1969 and the Royal Albert Hall, in 1970, also included Eleanor Barooshian (both Jacobs and Barooshian were former members of girl group The Cake). The band released two albums, both in 1970: Ginger Baker's Air Force and Ginger Baker's Air Force 2. The second album involved substantially different personnel from the first, with Ginger Baker and Graham Bond being the primary constants between albums. Ginger Baker's Air Force also played a set at Wembley Stadium on 19 April 1970, during the start of the World Cup Rally, which went from London to Mexico City. In late 2015 Baker announced he would be touring in 2016 with a new version of Ginger Baker's Air Force. The band booked a world tour under the name Ginger Baker's Air Force 3. Baker's blog said the band would be \\"showcasing new talent and collaborating with old friends.\\" The band played one show in London on 26 January 2015; the performance was shortened and Baker had to take many breaks due to an injury he had previously sustained. In late February 2016 the entire tour was cancelled due to doctors having diagnosed Baker with \\"serious heart problems\\". Baker died in October 2019.

In this approach, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum bring together a range of ideas that were previously excluded from (or inadequately formulated in) traditional approaches to the economics of welfare. The core focus of the capability approach is on what individuals are able to do (i.e., capable of).  Assessing capability  Initially, Sen argued for five components in assessing capability: # The importance of real freedoms in the assessment of a person's advantage # Individual differences in the ability to transform resources into valuable activities # The multi-variate nature of activities giving rise to happiness # A balance of materialistic and nonmaterialistic factors in evaluating human welfare # Concern for the distribution of opportunities within society Subsequently, and in collaboration particularly with political philosopher Martha Nussbaum, development economist Sudhir Anand and economic theorist James Foster, Sen has helped to make the capabilities approach predominant as a paradigm for policy debate in human development where it inspired the creation of the UN's Human Development Index (a popular measure of human development, capturing capabilities in health, education, and income). In addition, the approach has been operationalised with a high income country focus by Paul Anand and colleagues. Furthermore, since the creation of the Human Development and Capability Association in the early 2000s, the approach has been much discussed by political theorists, philosophers, and a range of social scientists, including those with a particular interest in human health. The approach emphasizes functional capabilities (\\"substantive freedoms\\", such as the ability to live to old age, engage in economic transactions, or participate in political activities); these are construed in terms of the substantive freedoms people have reason to value, instead of utility (happiness, desire-fulfillment or choice) or access to resources (income, commodities, assets). Poverty is understood as capability- deprivation. It is noteworthy that the emphasis is not only on how humans actually function but also on their having the capability, which is a practical choice, \\"to achieve outcomes that they value and have reason to value\\". Everyone could be deprived of such capabilities in many ways, e.g. by ignorance, government oppression, lack of financial resources, or false consciousness. This approach to human well-being emphasizes the importance of freedom of choice, individual heterogeneity and the multi-dimensional nature of welfare. In significant respects, the approach is consistent with the handling of choice within conventional microeconomics consumer theory, although its conceptual foundations enable it to acknowledge the existence of claims, like rights, which normatively dominate utility-based claims (see ).  Key terms  = Functionings = In the most basic sense, functionings consist of \\"beings and doings\\". As a result, living may be seen as a set of interrelated functionings. Essentially, functionings are the states and activities constitutive of a person's being. Examples of functionings can vary from elementary things, such as being healthy, having a good job, and being safe, to more complex states, such as being happy, having self-respect, and being calm. Moreover, Amartya Sen contends that functionings are crucial to an adequate understanding of the capability approach; capability is conceptualized as a reflection of the freedom to achieve valuable functionings. In other words, functionings are the subjects of the capabilities referred to in the approach: what we are capable, want to be capable, or should be capable to be and/or do. Therefore, a person's chosen combination of functionings, what they are and do, is part of their overall capability set ‚Äî the functionings they were able to do. Yet, functionings can also be conceptualized in a way that signifies an individual's capabilities. Eating, starving, and fasting would all be considered functionings, but the functioning of fasting differs significantly from that of starving because fasting, unlike starving, involves a choice and is understood as choosing to starve despite the presence of other options. Consequently, an understanding of what constitutes functionings is inherently tied together with an understanding of capabilities, as defined by this approach. = Capabilities = Capabilities are the alternative combinations of functionings that are feasible for a person to achieve. Formulations of capability have two parts: functionings and opportunity freedom ‚Äî the substantive freedom to pursue different functioning combinations. Ultimately, capabilities denote a person's opportunity and ability to generate valuable outcomes, taking into account relevant personal characteristics and external factors. The important part of this definition is the \\"freedom to achieve\\", because if freedom had only instrumental value (valuable as a means to achieve an end) and no intrinsic value (valuable in and of itself) to a person's well-being, then the value of the capability set as a whole would simply be defined by the value of a person's actual combination of functionings. Such a definition would not acknowledge the entirety of what a person is capable of doing and their resulting current state due to the nature of the options available to them. Consequently, the capability set outlined by this approach is not merely concerned with achievements; rather, freedom of choice, in and of itself, is of direct importance to a person's quality of life. For example, the difference between fasting and starving, on person's well-being, is whether the person is choosing not to eat. In this example, the functioning is starving but the capability to obtain an adequate amount of food is the key element in evaluating well-being between individuals in the two states. In sum, having a lifestyle is not the same as choosing it; well-being depends on how that lifestyle came to be. More formally, while the combination of a person's functionings represents their actual achievements, their capability set represents their opportunity freedom ‚Äî their freedom to choose between alternative combinations of functionings. In addition to being the result of capabilities, some functionings are also a prerequisite for capabilities, i.e., there is a dual role of some functionings as both ends and instruments. Examples of functionings that are a direct requirement for capabilities are good nourishment, mental and physical health, and education. An extension of the capabilities approach was published in 2013 in Freedom, Responsibility and Economics of the Person. This book explores the interconnected concepts of person, responsibility and freedom in economics, moral philosophy and politics. It tries to reconcile the rationality and morality of individuals. It presents a methodological reflection (phenomenology versus Kantian thought) with the aim to re-humanise the person, through actions, and through the values and norms that lead to corresponding rights and obligations that must be ordered. The book extends the capabilities approach in a critical form. In particular, it considers freedom in relation to responsibility, that is, the capacity of people to apply moral constraints to themselves. By contrast, Sen's capability approach considers freedom as a purely functional rationality of choice. = Agency = Amartya Sen defines an agent as someone who acts and brings about change, whose achievement can be evaluated in terms of his or her own values and goals. This differs from a common use of the term \\"agent\\" sometimes used in economics and game theory to mean a person acting on someone else's behalf. Agency depends on the ability to personally choose the functionings one values, a choice that may not correlate with personal well- being. For example, when a person chooses to engage in fasting, they are exercising their ability to pursue a goal they value, though such a choice may not positively affect physical well-being. Sen explains that a person as an agent need not be guided by a pursuit of well-being; agency achievement considers a person's success in terms of their pursuit of the whole of their goals. For the purposes of the capability approach, agency primarily refers to a person's role as a member of society, with the ability to participate in economic, social, and political actions. Therefore, agency is crucial in assessing one's capabilities and any economic, social, or political barriers to one's achieving substantive freedoms. Concern for agency stresses that participation, public debate, democratic practice, and empowerment, should be fostered alongside well-being. Alkire and Deneulin pointed out that agency goes together with the expansion of valuable freedoms. That is, in order to be agents of their lives, people need the freedom to be educated, speak in public without fear, express themselves, associate, etc.; conversely, people can establish such an environment by being agents. In summary, the agency aspect is important in assessing what a person can do in line with his or her conception of the good.  Nussbaum's central capabilities  Nussbaum (2000) frames these basic principles in terms of 10 capabilities, i.e. real opportunities based on personal and social circumstance. She claims that a political order can only be considered as being decent if this order secures at least a threshold level of these 10 capabilities to all inhabitants. Nussbaum's capabilities approach is centered around the notion of individual human dignity. Given Nussbaum's contention that the goal of the capabilities approach is to produce capabilities for each and every person, the capabilities below belong to individual persons, rather than to groups. The capabilities approach has been very influential in development policy where it has shaped the evolution of the human development index (HDI), has been much discussed in philosophy, and is increasingly influential in a range of social sciences. More recently, the approach has been criticized for being grounded in the liberal notion of freedom: The core capabilities Nussbaum argues should be supported by all democracies are: # Life. Being able to live to the end of a human life of normal length; not dying prematurely, or before one's life is so reduced as to be not worth living. # Bodily Health. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health; to be adequately nourished; to have adequate shelter. # Bodily Integrity. Being able to move freely from place to place; to be secure against violent assault, including sexual assault and domestic violence; having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction. # Senses, Imagination, and Thought. Being able to use the senses, to imagine, think, and reason‚Äîand to do these things in a \\"truly human\\" way, a way informed and cultivated by an adequate education, including, but by no means limited to, literacy and basic mathematical and scientific training. Being able to use imagination and thought in connection with experiencing and producing works and events of one's own choice, religious, literary, musical, and so forth. Being able to use one's mind in ways protected by guarantees of freedom of expression with respect to both political and artistic speech, and freedom of religious exercise. Being able to have pleasurable experiences and to avoid non-beneficial pain. # Emotions. Being able to have attachments to things and people outside ourselves; to love those who love and care for us, to grieve at their absence; in general, to love, to grieve, to experience longing, gratitude, and justified anger. Not having one's emotional development blighted by fear and anxiety. (Supporting this capability means supporting forms of human association that can be shown to be crucial in their development.) # Practical Reason. Being able to form a conception of the good and to engage in critical reflection about the planning of one's life. (This entails protection for the liberty of conscience and religious observance.) # Affiliation. ## Being able to live with and toward others, to recognize and show concern for other humans, to engage in various forms of social interaction; to be able to imagine the situation of another. (Protecting this capability means protecting institutions that constitute and nourish such forms of affiliation, and also protecting the freedom of assembly and political speech.) ## Having the social bases of self-respect and non- humiliation; being able to be treated as a dignified being whose worth is equal to that of others. This entails provisions of non-discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, caste, religion, national origin and species. # Other Species. Being able to live with concern for and in relation to animals, plants, and the world of nature. # Play. Being able to laugh, to play, to enjoy recreational activities. # Control over one's Environment. ## Political. Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one's life; having the right of political participation, protections of free speech and association. ## Material. Being able to hold property (both land and movable goods), and having property rights on an equal basis with others; having the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others; having the freedom from unwarranted search and seizure. In work, being able to work as a human, exercising practical reason and entering into meaningful relationships of mutual recognition with other workers. Although Nussbaum did not claim her list as definite and unchanging, she strongly advocated for outlining a list of central human capabilities. On the other hand, Sen refuses to supply a specific list of capabilities. Sen argues that an exact list and weights would be too difficult to define. For one, it requires specifying the context of use of capabilities, which could vary. Also, Sen argues that part of the richness of the capabilities approach is its insistence on the need for open valuational scrutiny for making social judgments. He is disinclined to in any way devalue the domain of reasoning in the public sphere. Instead, Sen argues that the task of weighing various capabilities should be left to the ethical and political considerations of each society based on public reasoning. Pdf version Along with concerns raised about Nussbaum's list, Alkire and Black also argue that Nussbaum's methodology \\"runs counter to an essential thrust of the capabilities approach which has been the attempt to redirect development theory away from a reductive focus on a minimally decent life towards a more holistic account of human well-being for all people.\\" That said, applications to development are discussed in Sen (1999), Nussbaum (2000), and Clark (2002, 2005), and are now numerous to the point where the capabilities approach is widely accepted as a paradigm in development. The programme of work operationalising the capability approach by Anand and colleagues draws heavily on Nussbaum's list as a relatively comprehensive, high-level account of the space in which human well-being or life quality is experienced. This work argues that the subitems on Nussbaum's list are too distinct to be monitored by single question and that a dashboard of some 40-50 indicators is required to inform the development of empirical work.  Measurement of capabilities  The measurement of capabilities was, in the early days, thought to be a particular barrier to the implementation and use of the approach. However, two particular lines of work, in research and policy have sought to show that meaningful indicators of what individuals (and in some cases governments) are able to do can be developed and used to generate a range of insights. In 1990, the UN Human Development report published the first such exercise which focused on health, education and income which were equally weighted to generate the Human Development Index. At the same time, and subsequently, researchers recognizing that these three areas covered only certain elements of life quality have sought to develop more comprehensive measures. A major project in this area has been the 'capabilities measurement project' in which Anand has led teams of philosophers, economists and social scientists to generate that gives a full and direct implement of the approach drawing particular on the key relations and concepts developed in Sen (1985) but also on work to do with the content of the approach. The earliest work in this project developed a set of around 50 capability indicators which were used to develop a picture of quality of life and deprivation in the UK. Subsequently, Anand and colleagues have developed datasets for the US, UK and Italy in which all the elements of Sen's framework are reflected in data which permits all three key equations, for functionings, experience and capabilities, to be estimated. In a series of papers, they have shown that both their primary data and some secondary datasets can be used to shed light on the production and distribution of life quality for working age adults, those in retirement, very young children, those vulnerable to domestic violence, migrants, excluded traveler communities and the disabled. They use these applications to argue that the capability framework is a particularly good fit for understanding quality of life across the life course and that it provides a relatively universal grammar for understanding the elements of human well-being. =Monetary vs. non-monetary measures of well-being= Monetary and non-monetary measures of well-being are ideal when used to complement each other. Understanding the various aspects of economic development process not only helps address issues of inequality and lags in human development, but also helps to pinpoint where countries lag, which once addressed can further promote well-being and advancement. As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2006) notes: > Well-being has several dimensions of which monetary factors are only one. > They are nevertheless an important one, since richer economies are better > placed to create and maintain other well-being-enhancing conditions, such as > a clean environment, the likelihood that the average person will have a > right to 10 years or more of education, and lead a comparatively long and > healthy life. Well-being will also be increased by institutions that enable > citizens to feel that they control their own lives, and that investment of > their time and resources will be rewarded. In turn, this will lead to higher > incomes in a virtuous circle. Simon Kuznets, the developer of GNP, cautioned against using the measure as an indicator of overall welfare, which speaks to the unintended use of output- based measures as indicators of human welfare. Critique of output-based measures The use of GDP and GNP as an approximation of well-being and development have been critiqued widely, because they are often misused as indicators of well-being and human development when in fact they are only telling about the economic capacity of a country or an average income level when expressed on a per person basis. In particular, feminist economics and environmental economics offer a number of critiques. Critics in these fields typically discuss gender inequalities, insufficient representation of environmental costs of productions and general issues of misusing an output- based measure for unintended purposes. In sum, the conclusion of Capabilities Approach is that people do not just value monetary income, and that development is linked to various indicators of life satisfaction and hence are important in measuring well-being. Development policies strive to create an environment for people to live long, healthy creative lives. Feminist critiques Nussbaum highlights some of the problematic assumptions and conclusions of output-based approaches to development. First, she notes that GNP and GDP do not consider special requirements to help the most vulnerable, such as women. Specifically, Nussbaum mentions that output-based approaches ignore the distribution of needs for the varying circumstances of people, for example a pregnant woman needs more resources than a non-pregnant woman or a single man. Also, output-based measures ignore unpaid work, which includes child rearing and the societal advantages that result from a mother's work. Marilyn Waring, a political economist and activist for women's rights, elaborates on the example of a mother engaged in child care, domestic care and producing few goods for the informal market, all of which are usually done simultaneously. These activities provide economic benefits, but are not valued in national accounting systems; this suggests that the definition of unemployment used in output-based measures is inappropriate. (See the article on Feminist economics, section \\"Well-being\\"). Environmental critiques Another critique by Waring is that the output-based measures ignore negative effects of economic growth See Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics. and so commodities that lower social welfare, such as nuclear weapons, and oil extraction which causes spills, are considered a good input. The \\"anti-bads\\" or the defensive expenditures to fight \\"bads\\" are not counted as a deduction in accounting systems (p. 11). Furthermore, natural resources are treated as limitless and negative outputs such as pollution and associated health risks, are not deducted from the measures. Technical and misinterpretation critiques When GNP and GDP were developed, their intended use was not for measuring human well-being; the intended use was as an indicator of economic growth, and that does not necessarily translate into human well-being. Kuznets has often made this point, in his words, \\"distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what\\" (p. 9). Nussbaum also points out that GNP and GDP omit income distribution and the opportunity or ability to turn resources into activities (this critique stems directly from Capabilities Approach). Kuznets terms this as a problem of \\"obtaining an unduplicated total of all output\\", (p. 15) this suggests that people are only seen as consumers and not as potential producers, hence any products purchased by an individual are not seen as \\"being consumed in the productive process of turning out other goods\\" (p. 15) These accounting measures also fail to capture all forms of work and only focus on \\"engagement in work 'for pay or profit, (p. 133) leaving out contributions to a society and economy, like volunteer work and subsistence farming. Kuznets provides the example of the process by which farmers devote time and energy to bringing virgin land into cultivation. Furthermore, GNP and GDP only account for monetary exchanges, and place no value on some important intangibles such as leisure time. =Shift to alternative measures= Capabilities Approach has been highly influential thus far in human development theories and valuational methods of capturing capabilities, the theory has led to the creation of the HDI, IHDI and GII and their uses among international organizations such as the United Nations and others. In companies, capabilities are included in Key Development Indicators, or KDIs as measures of development, including employee development. In 1990 in the Human Development Report (HDR)commissioned by the UNDP set out to create a distribution-sensitive development measure. This measure was created to rival the more traditional metrics of GDP and GNP, which had previously been used to measure level of development in a given country, but which did not contain provisions for terms of distribution. The resulting measure was entitled the Human Development Index, created by Mahbub ul Haq in collaboration with Sen and others. The purpose was to create an indicator of human development, especially one that would provide a general assessment and critique of global human development to shed light on persistent inequality, poverty and other capability deprivations despite high levels of GDP growth. Currently the HDI continues to be used in the Human Development Report in addition to many other measures (based on theoretical perspectives of Capabilities) that have been developed and used by the United Nations. Among these indices are the Gender- related Development Index (GDI), the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), introduced in 1995, and the more recent Gender Inequality Index (GII) and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), both adopted in 2010. =Capabilities-based indices= The following are a few of the major indices that were created based on the theoretical grounds of Capabilities Approach. Human development index The Human Development Index takes into consideration a number of development and well-being factors that are not taken into account in the calculation of GDP and GNP. The Human Development Index is calculated using the indicators of life expectancy, adult literacy, school enrollment, and logarithmic transformations of per-capita income. Moreover, it is noted that the HDI \\"is a weighted average of income adjusted for distributions and purchasing power, life expectancy, literacy and health\\" (p. 16) The HDI is calculated for individual countries with a value between 0 and 1 and is \\"interpreted...as the ultimate development that has been attained by that nation\\" (p. 17). Currently, the 2011 Human Development Report also includes the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index which accounts for exactly the same things that the HDI considers however the IHDI has all three dimensions (long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living) adjusted for inequalities in the distribution of each dimension across the population. Gender-related development index The Gender-related Development Index is defined as a \\"distribution-sensitive measure that accounts for the human development impact of existing gender gaps in the three components of the HDI\\" (p. 243). In this way, the GDI accounts for shortcomings in the HDI in terms of gender, because it re-evaluates a country's score in the three areas of the HDI based on perceived gender gaps, and penalizes the score of the country if, indeed, large gender disparities in those areas exist. This index is used in unison with the HDI and therefore also captures the elements of capabilities that the HDI holds. In addition, it considers women's capabilities which has been a focus in much of Sen's and Nussbaum's work (to list a few: Nussbaum, 2004a; Nussbaum, 2004b; Sen, 2001; Sen, 1990.) Gender empowerment measure The Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) is considerably more specialized than the GDI. The GEM focuses particularly on the relative empowerment of women in a given country. The empowerment of women is measured by evaluating women's employment in high- ranking economic positions, seats in parliament, and share of household income. Notably this measurement captures more of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities, such as, Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment. Gender inequality index In the 2013 Human Development Report the Gender Inequality Index, which was introduced in 2011, continues to adjust the GDI and the GEM. This composite measurement uses three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor force participation. When constructing the index the following criteria were key: conceptual relevance to definitions of human development and theory; Non- ambiguity so that the index is easily interpreted; Reliability of data that is standardized and collected/processed by a trustworthy organization; No redundancy found in other indicators; and lastly Power of discrimination, where distribution is well distinguished among countries and there is no \\"bunching\\" among top and bottom countries (p. 10). This index also captures some of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities (Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment). Other measures In 1997, the UNDP introduced the Human Poverty Index (HPI), which is aimed at measuring poverty in both industrialized and developing countries. The HPI is a \\"nonincome-based\\" measure of poverty (p. 100) which focuses on \\"human outcomes in terms of choices and opportunities that a person faces\\" (p. 99). In support of this index, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr‚Äîa development economist and past Director of The Human Development Report Office‚Äîdifferentiates between income poverty and human poverty. Human poverty can be interpreted as deprivations to lead a long healthy and creative life with a decent standard of living. = Economic evaluation in health care = The capability approach is being developed and increasingly applied in health economics, for use in cost- effectiveness analysis. It is seen as an alternative to existing preference- based measures of health-related quality of life (for example the EQ-5D) that focus on functioning, and can be applied within the framework of quality- adjusted life years (QALYs). A number of measures have been created for use in particular contexts such as older people, public health and mental health, as well as more generic capability-based outcome measures. Caution remains when measures do not explicitly rule out people's adaption to their circumstances, for example to physical health problems. =Alternative measures of well- being= As noted above, to a great extent, Nussbaum's Central Human Capabilities address issues of equality, political freedom, creativity and the right to the self, as do the various indices that are based on capabilities. It is evident that these measures are very subjective, but this fact is in the essence of defining quality of life according to Nussbaum and Sen. Nussbaum refers to Sen in saying that, although measures of well-being may be problematic in comparative, quantifiable models due to their subjective matter, the protection of and commitment to human development are too important of matters to be left on the sidelines of economic progress. Well- being and quality of life are too important to be left without intentional focus towards political change. Measures such as the HDI, GDI, GEM, GII, IHDI and the like are crucial in targeting issues of well-being and indicators of quality of life. Anand, et al. (2009) can be summarized as demonstrating that it is possible to measure capabilities within the conventions applied to standard household survey design, contrary to earlier doubts about the ability to operationalise the capabilities approach.  Contrast with other approaches  =Utility-based or subjective approaches = Much of conventional welfare economics today is grounded in a utilitarian approach according to the classical Benthamite form of utilitarianism, in which the most desirable action is the one that best increases peoples' psychological happiness or satisfaction. The \\"utility\\" of a person stands for some measure of his or her pleasure or happiness. Some merits associated with this approach to measuring well-being are that it recognizes the importance of taking account of the results of social arrangements in judging them and the need to pay attention to the well-being of the people involved when judging social arrangements and their results. Amartya Sen, however, argues this view has three main deficiencies: distributional indifference, neglect of rights, freedoms and other non-utility concerns, and adaptation and mental conditioning. Distributional indifference refers to a utilitarian indifference between different the distributions of utility, so long as the sum total is the same (note that the utilitarian is indifferent to the distribution of happiness, not income or wealth - the utilitarian approach would generally prefer, all else being equal, more materially equal societies assuming diminishing marginal utility). Sen argues that we may \\"want to pay attention not just to \\"aggregate\\" magnitudes, but also to extents of inequalities in happiness\\". Sen also argues that while the utilitarian approach attaches no intrinsic value (ethics) to claims of rights and freedoms, some people value these things independently of their contribution to utility. Lastly, Amartya Sen makes the argument that the utilitarian view of individual well-being can be easily swayed by mental conditioning and peoples' happiness adapting to oppressive situations. The utility calculus can essentially be unfair to those who have come to terms with their deprivation as a means for survival, adjusting their desires and expectations. The capability approach, on the other hand, doesn't fall victim to these same criticisms because it acknowledges inequalities by focusing on equalizing people's capabilities, not happiness, it stresses the intrinsic importance of rights and freedoms when evaluating well-being, and it avoids overlooking deprivation by focusing on capabilities and opportunities, not state of mind. = Resource-based approaches = Another common approach in conventional economics, in economic policy and judging development, has traditionally been to focus on income and resources. These sorts of approaches to development focus on increasing resources, such as assets, property rights, or basic needs. However, measuring resources is fundamentally different from measuring functionings, such as the case in which people don't have the capability to use their resources in the means they see fit. Arguably, the main difficulty in a resource- or income-based approach to well-being lies in personal heterogeneities, namely the diversity of human beings. Different amounts of income are needed for different individuals to enjoy similar capabilities, such as an individual with severe disabilities whose treatment to ensure the fulfillment of basic capabilities may require dramatically more income compared to an able-bodied person. All sorts of differences, such as differences in age, gender, talents, etc. can make two people have extremely divergent opportunities of quality of life, even when equipped with exactly the same commodities. Additionally, other contingent circumstances which affect what an individual can make of a given set of resources include environmental diversities (in geographic sense), variations in social climate, differences in relational perspectives, and distribution within the family. The capability approach, however, seeks to consider all such circumstances when evaluating people's actual capabilities. Furthermore, there are things people value other than increased resources. In some cases, maximizing resources may even be objectionable. As was recognized in the 1990 Human Development Report, the basic objective of development is to create an enabling environment for people to live long, healthy, and creative lives. This end is often lost in the immediate concern with the accumulation of commodities and financial wealth that are only a means to expansion of capabilities. Overall, though resources and income have a profound effect on what we can or cannot do, the capability approach recognizes that they are not the only things to be considered when judging well-being, switching the focus from a means to a good life to the freedom to achieve actual improvements in lives, which one has reason to value.

The one agreed datum is that Antiochus is referenced by Porphyry (234-c. 305 AD),Porphyry, Introduction to Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, chapter 38; Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum 5 part 4, p.210, line 6. and so Antiochus must have lived before the death of Porphyry. All the writings of Antiochus are now lost, but substantial fragments and extracts remain. The works ascribed to him are a Thesaurus (Treasuries), an Introduction (Eisagogika) to astrology, and also an astrological calendar, On the risings and settings of the stars in the 12 months of the year. Antiochus is extensively quoted or paraphrased by later writers, particularly the Neoplatonist Porphyry, and Rhetorius of Egypt. There is also a later Byzantine epitome, or summary, of his work. A parapegma or calendar of star risings and settings and weather changes is also extant. Antiochus was influential upon later astrologers. Parts of his text were used as the basis for Porphyry's third-century Introduction to the Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy, as well as being quoted by Hephaistio of Thebes (380 AD), Anonymous of 379 AD (Treatise on Fixed Stars) and Julius Firmicus Maternus (c. 336 AD). Porphyry relies heavily on Antiochus for definitions of technical terms used by Ptolemy in Tetrabiblos. Antiochus made one of the earliest references to astrological reception, and discussed the twelves houses (topoi) of the astrological chart, heliacal risings and settings, and the Lots.

Although he was not holding a high or powerful position, Zhao She carried out his duties according to the law. At this time there was a very powerful aristocrat by the name of Zhao Sheng, who refused to pay any land tax. In order to avoid punishing Zhao Sheng personally, Zhao She arrested the nine administrators who kept accounts for Zhao Sheng's family. Zhao Sheng became very angry and wanted to kill Zhao She. However, Zhao She scolded Zhao Sheng for not upholding the law of the state. Zhao She also reminded Zhao Sheng that as an aristocrat he should be an example in abiding by the law and not infringing on it lest the state would perish. Zhao Sheng realised that he was wrong and he not only apologised to Zhao She, but also recommended him to the ruler for promotion. Zhao She subsequently was promoted as the land tax collector of the whole state. In 271 BC the State of Qin sent a large army to attack Han, but would have to attack the Zhao territory in the way. The Zhao army was no match for the Qin, who captured a large part of the Zhao territory. The Qin forces were approaching E Yu (ÈñºËàá, in present-day Heshun county (ÂíåÈ†ÜÁ∏£), Shanxi province), which was very far from the Zhao capital of Handan. At that time the commander-in-chief of the Zhao forces, Lian Po recommended abandoning E Yu as it was too far away to reinforce. Also, the road to E Yu was narrow and winding. Zhao She told the ruler and the commander-in-chief that when two armies were fighting in a narrow and winding road it was like two rats fighting in a little hold with not much room to manoeuvre. The braver and stronger one would win. Zhao He, the ruler of Zhao, then appointed Zhao She to lead a reinforcing army to rescue E Yu. Zhao He equipped his troops with light armour for mobility and reached Qin forces' rear. Qin forces, in fear of being trapped, lifted the siege and turn its full strength against the approaching Zhao forces. Zhao He hid most of his troops on a mountain, which he estimated the Qin troops would approach by dusk. Sure enough, the Qin forces approached, and Zhao He ambushed them in the dark. With determination and bravery Zhao She defeated the Qin forces. The ruler of Zhao rewarded Zhao She by making him the administrator of a district called Ma Fu (È¶¨Êúç in present-day north of Handan city in Hebei province). Unfortunately for the state of Zhao, Zhao She died just years after this victory. He was succeeded by his son Zhao Kuo, who was the commander of the catastrophic Battle of Changping. Eventually in 228 BC the state of Zhao was subjugated by the State of Qin. The offspring of Zhao She adopted \\"Ma\\" (È¶¨), the first word of the district Ma Fu, as their surname.The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland Popular Culture In Manga and Anime Kingdom, he was identified in the manga, but died before the story began.

When first settled by MƒÅori almost a millennium ago, there was much land and resources, but war began to break out as the country's carrying capacity was approached. Initially being fought with close range weapons of wood and stone, this continued on and off until Europeans arrived, bringing with them new weapons such as muskets. Colonisation by Britain led to the New Zealand Wars in the 19th century in which settler and imperial troops and their MƒÅori allies fought against other MƒÅori and a handful of PƒÅkehƒÅ. In the first half of the 20th century, New Zealanders of all races fought alongside Britain in the Boer War and both World Wars. In the second half of the century and into this century the New Zealand Defence Force has provided token assistance to the United States in several conflicts. New Zealand has also contributed troops extensively to multilateral peacekeeping operations. MƒÅori tribal warfare before 1806 A drawing by Isaack Gilsemans, depicting a skirmish in Golden Bay, between his expedition and the MƒÅori in 1642. The level of intertribal warfare amongst pre-European MƒÅori is unknown. Oral histories, legends and whakapapa include many stories of battles and wars but little research has been carried out into how often wars actually happened. In Making Peoples James Belich argues that they were probably uncommon in the few centuries immediately after the arrival of MƒÅori in New Zealand in about 1280 CE, as there was ample land and resources to go around. Archaeological evidence suggests that following population growth and the extinction of the moa (a large flightless bird), warfare increased as tribes and hap≈´ (subtribes) competed over scarce resources. At some point, perhaps before this cultural change, one group migrated to the Chatham Islands, where they developed the largely pacifist Moriori culture. Their pacifism left the Moriori unable to defend themselves when the islands were invaded by mainland MƒÅori in the 1830s. In the 'classic' MƒÅori culture of 1550 CE onward,\\"Te Puawaitanga: 1500‚Äì1800\\", Te Papa warriors were held in high esteem, and fought with a range of weapons including stone and wooden clubs (patu) fighting staffs (taiaha) and spears (tao). MƒÅori were unusual in having no distance weapons such as bows or slings, so all fighting took place at close range. Defence was based on hill forts (pƒÅ), the remains of which can be seen all over New Zealand, especially the North Island. The largest battle recorded was that of Hingakaka with several thousand combatants. Musket Wars (1806‚Äì1845) The Musket Wars were a series of battles in the early 19th century, fought between various MƒÅori tribal groups, mainly on the North Island. Northern tribes, such as the rival NgƒÅ Puhi and NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua, were the first to obtain muskets and inflicted heavy casualties upon each other and on neighbouring tribes, some of whom had never seen firearms. In time, all the tribes traded to obtain muskets and the conflict ultimately reached an uneasy stalemate. The wars gave MƒÅori experience in fighting with and defending against guns ‚Äì experience which would be vital in the New Zealand Wars. In the Harriet Affair of 1834, a group of British soldiers of the 50th Regiment from Australia landed in Taranaki to rescue the wife and children of John (Jacky) Guard and punish the kidnappers, the first clash between MƒÅori and British troops. The expedition was sent by Governor Bourke from Sydney, but was subsequently criticised for use of excessive force by a British House of Commons report in 1835. New Zealand Wars (1843‚Äì1872) H≈çne Heke cutting down the flagpole on Flagstaff Hill. Heke's challenge to British authority served as the impetus for the Flagstaff War. The New Zealand Wars were a series of wars fought between MƒÅori on one side and a mixture of settler troops, imperial troops and MƒÅori on the other. What the wars were fought over has been debated by historians, with Keith Sinclair arguing that they were about land, while James Belich has argued that although land was a major factor, the wars were essentially a contest over sovereignty. This debate is reflected in the naming of the wars: there is no real consensus over whether they should be called the 'New Zealand Wars' or the 'Land Wars', although Belich's books and television series about the conflict popularised the former term, as did a book by historian James Cowan published in the 1920s. The name 'MƒÅori Wars' has fallen into disuse. MƒÅori names for the armed conflicts are Te Riri PƒÅkehƒÅ (\\"white man's anger\\") or NgƒÅ pakanga o Aotearoa (\\"the great New Zealand wars\\"). While the fighting began in 1843 and the last shots were arguably fired in the early 20th century, the bulk of fighting took place in the 1860s. The first skirmish of the New Zealand Wars was the 1843 Wairau Affray at the north end of the South Island. It was an isolated incident caused by the Nelson settlers trying to seize land they did not own, an extra-legal vigilante action that resulted in twenty-two of them being killed. The Flagstaff or Northern War took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the Bay of Islands, in March 1845 and January 1846. This was about mana‚Äîtribal prestige‚Äîand customs duties. It was really a war between rival MƒÅori chiefs with the British fighting on one side for the prestige of the British Empire. This was followed almost immediately by the Hutt Valley Campaign, March to August 1846, and the Wanganui Campaign, April to July 1847, in the south-west of the North Island. Both these conflicts were about the encroachment of the European settlers onto MƒÅori land. In the first three wars, MƒÅori fought the British to a standstill each time. From the engagements emerged an understanding: English law prevailed in the townships and settlements, and MƒÅori law and customs elsewhere. There followed a period of relative peace and economic cooperation from 1848 to 1860. During this time European settlement accelerated and in about 1859 the number of PƒÅkehƒÅ came to equal the number of MƒÅori, at around 60,000 each. By now PƒÅkehƒÅ had largely forgotten the painful lessons of the earlier conflicts. They tried to use military might to push through a very dubious land sale that the courts later repudiated. The result was the First Taranaki War. Once again the local British forces were more than evenly matched by MƒÅori, and after twelve months both sides were happy to settle for a draw. The death of Gustavus von Tempsky by Tƒ´tokowaru's forces in 1868. Tƒ´tokowaru's War was one of the last major conflicts of the New Zealand wars. However, this was clearly just a preliminary. The British settlers were not prepared to countenance MƒÅori controlling and ruling most of the land in the North Island. War broke out again in 1863 with the Invasion of the Waikato. To assist in this war, a temporary navy was established. This was the Waikato Flotilla, New Zealand's first de facto navy, comprising eight riverboats, four armoured barges, five coastal boats and a naval dockyard. The Waikato War, including the Tauranga Campaign, was the biggest of all the New Zealand Wars. The outcome of this war was the major confiscation of land owned by MƒÅori, which quickly provoked the Second Taranaki War. By the mid-1860s the conflict had forced the closing of all the native schools. The period from the second half of 1864 until early 1868 was relatively quiet. Possibly the most notorious incident during this time was the murder of the missionary Carl Volkner. There were also two serious intra-tribal conflicts, civil wars in MƒÅori tribes, between adherents and non-adherents of the Pai Marire or Hau Hau sect‚Äîa vehemently anti-PƒÅkehƒÅ religious group which was intent upon balancing the developing unbalanced cooperation between the MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ. These are sometimes known as the East Cape War, but that label oversimplifies a complicated series of conflicts. The last major conflicts were Te Kooti's War and Titokowaru's War. These were fought at the same time but were not related to each other and should be considered as separate conflicts. This ended the major, violent conflicts between the new colonial government and the original occupants of the land. There were subsequently other conflicts and incidents that were a part of the overall conflict, but are not usually seen in the context of the New Zealand Wars. The invasion of Parihaka in 1881 was certainly one of these. There was an incident in the 1890s that became known as the Dog Tax War. Another was the arrest of Rua Kenana in 1916. It is even possible that events at Bastion Point in the 1970s should be considered as part of the same scenario. Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) 1st New Zealand Contingent in Karori, 1899 The Second Boer War, fought from 11 October 1899 until 31 May 1902 and between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic), resulted from the history of British encroachment into or involvement in areas already settled by Afrikaners ‚Äì who were known colloquially as Boers (farmers) ‚Äì the descendants of the original Dutch settlers. This was exacerbated by the discovery of gold and diamonds in the South African Republic, after which many miners from British Empire countries migrated there. Sixth New Zealand Contingent marching in Auckland in 1901 before sailing to South Africa for the Second Boer War. New Zealand decided to help fight for the Empire and sent 6,500 mounted troops to assist the British efforts, making the war New Zealand's first overseas military campaign. Virtually every man in New Zealand was desperately keen to get to war, so the first soldiers to go were selected on the basis of who could afford to go. If a man could provide his own horse, rifle and equipment, costing about ¬£25 in total, he could go to war. The first two of the 10 contingents paid their own way. The proposal to send the first contingent ‚Äì 200 mounted riflemen ‚Äì was approved by Parliament prior to the outbreak of war on 28 September 1899. Prime Minister Richard Seddon's proposition to do so was overwhelmingly supported, meeting opposition from only five members of parliament. The volunteers of the first two contingents were mainly members of New Zealand's existing permanent or voluntary forces and were expected to supply their own equipment and horses. The Third and Fourth Contingents were organised by regional politicians and businesspeople: the Third organised mainly from Canterbury, and the Fourth from Otago. These two Contingents were also largely paid for through local fundraising rather than central government, and together they became known as the Rough Riders. The remaining contingents were funded by the British Government. The Boer War was the first overseas conflict to involve New Zealand troops, and was the first conflict the nation was involved in since the New Zealand Wars had ceased in the early 1870s. The New Zealand soldiers in South Africa suffered 230 casualties ‚Äì most of those from either accident or disease. The women of New Zealand were also supportive of the war. Girls' and Ladies' Khaki Corps (or 'Contingents') were organised throughout the country during 1900 to raise funds as part of New Zealand's South African War effort (1899‚Äì1902). Denied entry into active war service, women threw themselves into patriotic work on the home front. The contingents were quickly established throughout New Zealand in cities and small towns. Young society women dressed in khaki uniforms with skirts and hats (modelled on men's uniforms). The Khaki Corps had a full range of military titles and local volunteer officers coached members in military exercises. Members participated in influential fundraising events such as the Patriotic Carnival at Government House in 1900 organised by Lady Douglas in aid of the Wellington More Men Fund. In total, New Zealand provided ten contingents to the British, numbering 6,500 men. New Zealand losses were seventy-one men killed in action, twenty-five killed in accidents and 133 of disease. Figures for New Zealanders serving with units outside of the New Zealand contingents are unknown. First World War (1914‚Äì1918) disembark at Anzac Cove in 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign. When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the dominion of New Zealand automatically entered the war also. The total number of New Zealand troops and nurses to serve overseas in 1914‚Äì1918, excluding those in British and other Dominion forces, was 103,000, from a population of just over a million.Mary Edmond-Paul (2008). Lighted windows: critical essays on Robin Hyde . Otago University Press. p. 77. Forty-two percent of men of military age served in the NZEF. 16,697 New Zealanders were killed and 41,317 were wounded during the war ‚Äì a 58 percent casualty rate. Approximately a further thousand men died within five years of the war's end, as a result of injuries sustained, and 507 died whilst training in New Zealand between 1914 and 1918. The First World War saw MƒÅori soldiers officially serve for the first time in a major conflict with the New Zealand Army. 2688 MƒÅori and 346 Pacific islanders served with New Zealand forces in total. New Zealand's first act of the war was to seize and occupy German Samoa. Although Germany refused to officially surrender the islands, no resistance was offered and the occupation took place without any fighting ‚Äì the second German territory to be occupied in the name of King George V. After Major General Alexander Godley departed with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in October 1914, Major General Alfred William Robin commanded New Zealand Military Forces at home throughout the War as commandant, and was pivotal in ensuring the ongoing provision of reinforcements and support to the New Zealand military forces within New Zealand. Members of the New Zealand Division in the switch line near Flers, in September 1916, shortly after the Battle of Flers- Courcelette. The first major battle fought by New Zealand troops was Gallipoli. A navigational error led to the ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) being landed at the wrong place. 2701 New Zealanders were killed and 4852 wounded during a bitter struggle which failed to achieve any military objectives. Despite this, the significance of the battle of Gallipoli was strongly felt in New Zealand (and Australia) where it was the first great conflict experienced by the fledgling nations. The landing is commemorated in New Zealand and Australia each year, on Anzac Day. New Zealanders fought elsewhere in the Middle East, where they took a minor part in the Senussi Campaign and, more importantly, in the ultimately successful Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Turkish. New Zealanders fought in most of the battles leading up to the fall of Jerusalem and the defeat of the Ottoman Army, and were praised for their fighting alongside their Australian and British comrades. A total of 17,723 New Zealanders served in this campaign and New Zealand casualties were 640 killed in action and 1,146 wounded. In France, the New Zealand Division participated in the Battle of the Somme, where they advanced three kilometres and captured eight kilometres of enemy front line. 7,048 had become casualties, of whom 1,560 were killed. In June 1917, the New Zealand Division further distinguished itself in the storming of Messines ridge and the capture of the village of Messines. During the fighting at Passchendaele in the following October, however, it was bloodily repulsed in its second attack, with 850 dead in exchange for no more than of ground gained. This was the first time the division had failed in a major operation and remains the worst disaster in New Zealand's history in terms of lives lost in a single day. New Zealand soldiers and civilians in London at the end of World War I, in 1918. The division also fought against the German Spring Offensive of 1918. Later they captured the town of Le Quesnoy in a daring assault led by Lieutenant Leslie Cecil Lloyd Averill on 4 November 1918. The day proved to be Division's most successful of their whole time on the Western Front as they pushed east and advanced ten kilometres, capturing 2000 German soldiers and sixty field guns. New Zealand also contributed to the war at sea. The cruiser HMS Philomel patrolled the Gulf of Alexandretta in the Eastern Mediterranean, supporting several landings and sustaining three fatal casualties, one being the first New Zealander killed in action in the war. She also took part in the defence of the Suez Canal, operations in the Gulf of Aden and patrols in the Persian Gulf. In June 1917, a German raider laid minefields in New Zealand waters, causing the loss of a merchant ship off Farewell Spit and another off Three Kings Islands. New Zealand had no air force of her own during the First World War but several hundred New Zealanders served with the Royal Flying Corps, the Royal Naval Air Service, the Royal Air Force and Australian Flying Corps. The main base for New Zealanders while in Europe was Sling Camp on the Salisbury Plains in England, the camp is now gone but the high chalk Bulford Kiwi that the troops carved into hillside while awaiting repatriation remains to this day.  Fiji Expeditionary Force (1920)  In the first peacetime deployment of New Zealand Forces overseas (other than commemorative contingents), New Zealand deployed a fifty six strong force of regular soldiers to Fiji to support the civilian authorities during a period of civil unrest. Under the command of Major Edward Puttick, the small force deployed to Fiji on the government steamer Tutanekai on 5 February 1920 and would remain in Fiji until 18 April 1920. Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) 2nd NZEF, 20th Battalion, marching in Baggush, Egypt, 1941. New Zealand entered World War II by declaring war on Germany as of 9.30 pm, on 3 September 1939 (NZT). Politically, New Zealand had been a vocal opponent of European fascism and also the appeasement of those dictatorships, national sentiment for a strong show of force was generally supported. Economic and defensive considerations also motivated the New Zealand involvement; reliance on Britain meant that if she were threatened, New Zealand would be too in terms of economic and defensive ties. There was also a strong sentimental link between the former British colony and the United Kingdom, with many seeing Britain as the \\"mother country\\" or \\"Home\\". The Prime Minister of the time, Michael J. Savage, summed this up at the outbreak of war with a quote that would become a popular cry in New Zealand during the war;:\\"Where Britain goes, we go! Where she stands, we stand!\\" New Zealand provided personnel for service in the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and British Royal Navy, the Royal New Zealand Navy was placed at the Admiralty's disposal and new medium bombers waiting in the United Kingdom to be shipped to New Zealand were made available to the RAF. The New Zealand Army contributed the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). In total, around 140,000 New Zealand personnel served overseas for the Allied war effort, and an additional 100,000 men were armed for Home Guard duty. At its peak in July 1942, New Zealand had 154,549 men and women under arms (excluding the Home Guard) and by the war's end a total of 194,000 men and 10,000 women had served in the armed forces at home and overseas. The costs for the country were high ‚Äì 11,625 killed, a ratio of 6,684 dead per million in the population which was the highest rate in the Commonwealth (Britain suffered 5,123 and Australia 3,232 per million population). =Middle East and Europe= The 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) was formed under Major-General Bernard C. Freyberg and would see active service in the Mediterranean and Middle East throughout the war, fighting in Greece, Crete, North Africa, Italy, and Yugoslavia. The main fighting unit of the expeditionary force was the 2nd New Zealand Division, also commanded by Freyberg. New Zealand soldiers recapture a Matilda II tank, and its German crew, during Operation Crusader, 3 December 1941. The 2NZEF participated in the Battle of Greece, in April 1941, along with British and other Commonwealth troops, and Greek defenders. After Germany invaded Greece the Allies were forced to retreat, and the New Zealanders lost 291 men killed, 1,826 captured and 387 seriously wounded. Most of the remaining New Zealand troops were evacuated to Crete, where Freyberg became commander of the Allied forces on the island. The Germans subsequently invaded Crete, and after several days of heavy fighting in the Battle of Crete, took the island. Ultimately 17,000 troops were evacuated to Alexandria by the British surrender on 1 June. Most of the New Zealanders made it, but 2,180 were captured. Additional New Zealand casualties for the Battle of Crete were 671 dead and 967 wounded. New Zealand Second Lieutenant Charles Upham, the only person to receive two Victoria Crosses during World War II and the only combat soldier to receive the award twice, gained his first award during the battle. From November 1941, the 2NZEF was heavily involved in the North African Campaign. As part of Operation Crusader, New Zealand troops took part in the relief of Tobruk after the city had been besieged by the German Afrika Korps, under Erwin Rommel. Subsequently, the New Zealand government insisted that the division be withdrawn to Syria to recover ‚Äì 879 men were killed and 1,700 wounded in Operation Crusader, the most costly battle the division fought in the Second World War. In June 1942, the Afrika Korps captured Tobruk, and the 2NZEF was recalled from Syria. The Korps' advance was halted by the Allies in the First Battle of El Alamein, where New Zealand troops captured Ruweisat Ridge in a successful night attack. Heavy casualties were suffered by the two New Zealand brigades involved as they were attacked by German tanks, with several thousand men taken prisoner. Charles Upham earned a bar for his Victoria Cross in this battle. Subsequent fighting, including the Second Battle of El Alamein, resulted in German retreat from the area, into Tunisia. On 13 May 1943, the North African campaign ended, with the surrender of the last 275,000 Axis troops in Tunisia. On the 15th the division began the withdrawal back to Egypt, and by 1 June the division was back in Maadi and Helwan, on standby for use in Europe. Total New Zealand losses since November 1941, were 2,989 killed, 7,000 wounded and 4,041 taken prisoner. New Zealand troops were transferred to the Italian Front later in the year and participated in the Battle of Monte Cassino and the advance through northern Italy through to the German surrender and the 2nd Division's occupation of Trieste. from Germany. Battle of Vella Lavella, 1943. =Pacific= When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the New Zealand government raised another expeditionary force known as the 2nd NZEF in the Pacific, or 2nd NZEF (I.P.), for service with the Allied Pacific Ocean Areas command. This force supplemented existing garrison troops in the South Pacific. The main fighting formation of the 2nd NZEF (I.P.) was the 3rd New Zealand Division. However the 3rd Division never fought as a formation; its component brigades being involved in semi-independent actions as part of the Allied forces in the Solomons, in Vella Lavella, Treasury Islands and Green Islands. The New Zealand Army units were eventually replaced by American formations, which released personnel for service with the 2nd Division in Italy, or to cover civilian labour shortages. Air force squadrons and Navy units contributed to the Allied island hopping campaign. German and Japanese surface raiders and submarines operated in New Zealand waters on several occasions in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1945 sinking a total of four ships. =Naval war= At the outbreak of war, New Zealand still contributed to the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. Many New Zealanders served alongside other Commonwealth sailors in vessels of the Royal Navy and would continue to do so throughout the war. Not until 1941 was the Royal New Zealand Navy formed. Before then New Zealand men and ships had already been in action. On 13 December 1939 took part in The Battle of the River Plate as part of small British force against the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee. The action resulted in the German ship retiring to neutral Uruguay and being scuttled a few days later. Other cruisers and HMNZS Leander took the RNZN to all theatres ‚Äì Leander destroyed Italian \\"auxiliary cruiser\\" Ramb I and helped destroy the Japanese cruiser Jintsu. Gambia was present at the Japanese surrender. A morale boosting episode was the encounter between two small and out gunned minesweepers ‚Äì HMNZS Kiwi and Moa ‚Äì and the much larger Japanese submarine I-1, which was destroyed by ramming. =Air war= Mosquitos during a jailbreak raid, known as Operation Jericho, in 1944. The role of the Royal New Zealand Air Force was initially seen as a purely training organisation which supplied pilots to the Royal Air Force. New Zealand's only modern aircraft ‚Äì 30 Vickers Wellington bombers ‚Äì had been loaned to the United Kingdom, along with their aircrew, in August 1938. Over ten thousand New Zealanders served as aircrew with the Royal Air Force, 3,290 of them lost their lives, and 580 were made prisoners of war. Three won Victoria crosses. While the majority served with squadrons composed of airmen from all parts of the Commonwealth, 7 squadrons of the Royal Air Force were designated New Zealand units, one of these, No. 75 Squadron RNZAF flew the most missions and suffered the highest casualties of any allied bomber squadron. Several New Zealanders rose to high rank in the Royal Air Force, of whom Air Vice Marshal Sir Keith Park, who commanded No 11 Group, Fighter Command which bore the brunt of the Battle of Britain, is probably the best known. When Japan entered the war the RNZAF was immediately in the front line. The undertrained and equipped No. 488 Squadron RNZAF fought a futile defence of Singapore, while obsolete giant biplane Short Singapores and Vickers Vincents were operating from Fiji. The RNZAF had already undertaken some fruitless searches for German commerce raiders. However, in December 1941, it was still essentially a training organisation for the RAF. Over the next 12 months the RNZAF undertook rapid transition into a combat force ‚Äì initially arming all available machines, including airliners, against possible Japanese attack, then, re- equipping with more modern lendlease machines, before moving forward to take the war to Japan. Including training establishments, more New Zealanders ended up serving with the RNZAF than RAF, (although fewer aircrew). Ultimately the RNZAF sent 13 squadrons of fighter aircraft, 6 bomber squadrons, two torpedo bomber squadrons, two flying boat squadrons and three transport squadrons against the Japanese, and this force achieved considerable success in 1943‚Äì1944. The highest scoring commonwealth ace in the Pacific was a New Zealander, Geoff Fisken. =Aftermath= Troops of the 2NZEF and RNZAF 14 Squadron contributed to the Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan after the end of the war, remaining there until 1948.Subritzky, Mike (1995).

The RNZAF was also involved in the airlift of supplies to West Berlin during the Berlin Blockade by the Soviet Union in the late 1940s. This was New Zealand's first involvement in what was to become the Cold War. Compulsory Military Training (1949‚Äì1959, 1962‚Äì1972) From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, compulsory military training (CMT) was twice established by a National Party government and then abolished by a Labour Party government. On 3 August 1949 a national referendum was held in regards to instituting CMT, and conscription into the Territorial Force of the New Zealand Army. The vote was 553,016 in favour of conscription and 152,443 against. More than 60,000 young New Zealanders completed the 18 weeks of training. The second Labour government abolished the programme in 1958, but it was reinstated in revised form after Labour lost power. About 3,000 18-year-olds were selected annually by a ballot of birthdates. The scheme was abolished by the third Labour government on 31 December 1972. Since that date, all service in the New Zealand Armed Forces has been voluntary. Conscripts were never sent to battle zones in this period, although many opted to continue their military careers and fight in Malaysia, Vietnam and other theatres of conflict. Malaysia (1949‚Äì1966) =Malayan Emergency (1949‚Äì1964)= The Malayan Emergency was declared by the British government on 18 June 1948 after guerrillas of the Malayan Races Liberation Army, the militant arm of the Malayan Communist Party killed three British rubber planters. Initially New Zealand made a small contribution of planes, officers and frigates. New Zealand became more directly involved in the Emergency from 1955, following its decision to contribute forces to the British Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve, the primary role of which was to deter communist aggression in South-East Asia, and to provide a capacity for the immediate implementation of defence plans in the event that deterrence failed. As a secondary role, the forces committed to the Reserve were permitted to take part in actions against the guerrillas. The Special Air Service (SAS) and the RNZAF were deployed, with the RNZAF carrying out its first operational strike mission since the Second World War and its first with jet aircraft. In 1958 the New Zealand Regiment replaced the SAS. By the time the 2nd Battalion of the New Zealand Regiment arrived in late 1959 as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, to replace the 1st Battalion, most of the Communist guerrillas had retreated across the border into southern Thailand and the Malayan government saw the security situation to be stable enough to declare the Emergency over on 31 July 1960. New Zealand soldiers would be periodically deployed to Border Security Area as part of counter-insurgency measures over the next four years. About 1300 New Zealanders served in the Emergency, of whom 15 died, three as a result of enemy action. =Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation (1963‚Äì66)= The withdrawal parade in Labuan of the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy at the end of the confrontation, in 1966. As a part of its withdrawal from its Southeast Asian colonies, the United Kingdom moved to combine its colonies on Borneo, Sarawak and British North Borneo, with those on peninsular Malaya, to form the Federation of Malaysia. This move was opposed by the government of Indonesia. The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation began on 20 January 1963 when Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio announced that Indonesia would pursue a policy of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) with the Malaysia. From late 1963 the British requested New Zealand military aid in the area. The second National government initially refused, not wishing to be involved in a war with Indonesia. However, when Indonesian paratroopers landed in Johore in September 1964, the New Zealand Infantry Regiment was one of the few Commonwealth units in the region and with the New Zealand government's permission hunted down the infiltrators. The following month, 52 soldiers landed in Pontian on the Johore-Malacca border and were also captured by New Zealand soldiers. A change in New Zealand policy came as Sukarno increased the flow of Indonesian insurgents into Borneo and British military resources were stretched to almost breaking point. The New Zealand government could no longer deny the genuine appeals for assistance and the first New Zealand deployment was made to fight the insurgency ‚Äì a Special Air Service detachment and the 1st Battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, along with several Navy ships. New Zealand forces were involved in some fighting, but in late 1965 General Suharto came to power in Indonesia, following a coup d'√©tat. Due to this domestic conflict, Indonesian interest in pursuing the war with Malaysia declined, and the conflict officially ended in May 1966. Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) 25 pounder guns of the New Zealand Field Battery during the Korean War, 1951. New Zealand contributed six frigates, several smaller craft and a 1044 strong volunteer force (known as KAYFORCE) to the Korean War. The ships were under the command of a British flag officer and formed part of the US Navy screening force during the Battle of Inchon, and performed shore raids and inland bombardments. KAYFORCE was formed around an artillery regiment, 16th Field Regiment, and distinguished itself at the Battle of Kapyong. New Zealand troops remained in Korea in significant numbers for four years after the 1953 armistice, the last New Zealand soldiers leaving in 1957, and a single liaison officer remained until 1971. A total of 3,794 New Zealand soldiers served in KAYFORCE and 1300 in the Navy deployment. 33 were killed in action, 79 wounded and 1 soldier was taken prisoner. That prisoner was held in North Korea for eighteen months and repatriated after the armistices. A New Zealander flying with the Royal Air Force was also captured when he was shot down near P'yongyang, and was repatriated at around the same time. One RNZN sailor was killed during the conflict. Vietnam War (1964‚Äì1972) As for other countries, the Vietnam War would prove to be a highly controversial conflict for New Zealand, sparking widespread protest at home from anti- Vietnam War movements modelled on their American counterparts. This conflict was also the first in which New Zealand did not fight alongside the United Kingdom, instead following the loyalties of the ANZUS Pact. New Zealand's contribution commenced in 1964 with an initial deployment of non-combatant engineers followed by an artillery battery (161 Battery RNZA) from 1965; 2 infantry companies (V and W Companies) drawn from the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment in Malaysia from 1967; and the New Zealand SAS from 1968. New Zealand combat forces served alongside Australian forces until 1971. Two NZDF training teams followed, contributing to the allied effort to teach South Vietnamese forces to defend themselves before leaving in 1972. Over 5 years the RNZIR companies did 9 tours between them, and along with the NZSAS saw consistent action with few losses (37 KIA and 187 wounded), a testament to their skills in jungle warfare. Almost 4000 New Zealanders served in Vietnam. Afghanistan (2001‚Äì2019) A New Zealand soldier with Afghan civilians during a patrol in 2011. New Zealand forces fought in Afghanistan following the United States-led invasion of that country after the 11 September attacks. SAS personnel were dispatched in late 2001, and in March 2002 they took part in Operation Anaconda against about 500 to 1000 al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the Shahi-Kot Valley and Arma Mountains southeast of Zorma, Afghanistan. New Zealand has also supplied two transport aircraft and the 122-strong tri- service New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team (NZPRT), which had been located in Bamyan Province since April 2003. A further deployment in 2004 resulted in members of a further SAS contingent receiving gallantry decorations that were gazetted in 2007, including a Victoria Cross for Corporal Willie Apiata. Lieutenant Tim O'Donnell 2/1 RNZIR part of the NZPRT was killed in combat on 4 August 2010. Two other New Zealanders were injured in the incident. This was the first combat death of a New Zealand soldier since Leonard Manning was killed in East Timor in July 2000. A second member of the SAS was killed in Afghanistan on 18 August 2011, while responding to an attack on the British Council building. Three more soldiers were killed by an IED in August 2012. The NZPRT withdrew from Bamyan in April 2013 with a small New Zealand contingent remaining in Afghanistan in Kabul. This contingent contributes personnel to the Afghan National Army Officer Academy and, in June 2019, the New Zealand Government decided to continue the involvement of NZ troops until June 2020. As of April 2013, New Zealand's contribution to the war in Afghanistan has cost $300 million. By September 2018, NZDF troops had suffered eight combat deaths.  Operations against ISIL  On 8 August 2014, US-led coalition military operations against ISIS commenced in Iraq following an urgent request for international assistance from the Iraqi Government. This operation was formalised in September 2014 under the US designator Operation Inherent Resolve. New Zealand noted that the reason they joined the operation was due to ISIS's unprecedented success, brutal tactics and harm to civilians, and ability to recruit, fund and carry out sophisticated combat, terrorist and information operations. Peacekeeping and Observer Missions The New Zealand military has been involved in a number of peacekeeping and observer missions. These have included military observation in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 2004, humanitarian action in Somalia from 1992 to 1994, military observation in Haiti from 1994 to 1995, and military liaison in Kosovo from 1999 to the present. Operations in which a significant number of New Zealanders participated include: =Kashmir (1952‚Äì76)= In 1952, three New Zealand officers were seconded as military observers for the United Nations Military Observer Group in the Kashmir, to supervise a ceasefire between Pakistan and India. Many New Zealand officers, including Territorial Force officers, saw service with the force until 1976. =Lebanon/Syria/Israel: UNTSO= For many years, New Zealand has contributed Military Observers (currently eight NZDF personnel) to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in the Middle East. These personnel work as military observers and are based in Syria, Israel and Southern Lebanon. The observers ensure that peace agreements or cease fires are observed and any violations to peace or security in the region are reported. In the aftermath of Israeli operations against Hezbollah in 2006, a joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal team was deployed to assist in clearing a large quantity of unexploded munitions in Southern Lebanon. =Rhodesia: Operation Agila (1979‚Äì1980)= ZIPRA assembly in Rhodesia, 1980. In 1979, New Zealand contributed a force of seventy-five officers and men to the Commonwealth Monitoring Force which was established to oversee the implementation of the agreement which had ended the Rhodesian War. Troops supervised the concentration of the guerrilla forces into sixteen Assembly Places during the period in which the cease fire was implemented and national elections held. Following the election the Commonwealth Monitoring Force began withdrawing from the newly independent and renamed Zimbabwe on 2 March 1980 with the final members of the force leaving on 16 March. =Multi- National Force and Observers (1982‚Äìpresent)= On ANZAC Day 1982, a small group of twenty six New Zealand soldiers arrived in the Sinai as New Zealand's commitment to the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO). This was to be the beginning of an ongoing commitment of New Zealand Peacekeepers to the Sinai region. The task of the MFO was initially to supervise the withdrawal of Israeli military units from Egyptian territory. A rotary wing of the Royal New Zealand Air Force also served until 1986. New Zealand increased its commitment to this Mission, which is now tri-service in nature, with a group of about two platoons of specialist servicemen and women serving a six-month Tour of Duty with the MFO. =Iran-Iraq War (1988)= During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War two New Zealand frigates joined the Royal Navy in monitoring merchant shipping in the Persian Gulf. A team of 10 deployed to the Persian Gulf in August 1988 as part of the United Nations Iran‚ÄìIraq Military Observer Group to monitor compliance with the ceasefire. =Iraq (1990-1998)= In September 1990, the tanker HMNZS Endeavour was deployed alongside the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) task force to assist with transportation. On the 17 December 1990, New Zealand two C-130 Hercules transport aircraft of No.40 Squadron arrived at King Khalid airport. These aircraft delivered troops and freight such as ammunition, mail, and equipment. They conducted 157 sorties and were withdrawn on the 4 April 1991. On the 16 January 1991, 32 of the 1st New Zealand Army Medical Team were integrated with the 6th Naval Fleet in Bahrain. They were later joined on the 21 January with a 20 strong tri-service medical team. From February 1991, Six Skyhawks and 60 personnel of No.2 Squadron assisted RAN anti-aircraft exercises. 119 NZ personnel were deployed in the Persian Gulf war consisting of maintenance and admin staff, pilots, air-movements, guards, and medics. After the war, New Zealand contributed UNSCOM staff to verify Iraqi weapon facilities. In October 1995 and May 1996, HMNZS Wellington and Canterbury were deployed to the Persian Gulf to enforce sanctions. In 1998, during operation Desert Thunder, two Orion aircraft and two NZSAS teams in addition to a naval team were deployed to Diego Garcia and Kuwait respectively. =Cambodia (1991-2005) = In 1992, New Zealand contributed 30 non-combatant engineers to the Mine Clearing Training Unit (MCTU) and 40 communications specialists. In late 1992, the RNZN tasked a 30 strong team with coastal patrols and aided Vietnamese refugees. =Somalia (1992‚Äì1995) = New Zealand contributed to the International and United Nations Operation in Somalia efforts in Somalia with: *New Zealand Army **Supply Detachment, Dec 1992 to June 1993 **Supply Platoon x 2 rotations, July 1993 to July 1994 **Senior officers and admin pers with UNOSOM headquarters, 1992 to 1995 *Royal New Zealand Air Force **42 Squadron (Andover C Mk1) x 2 rotations,1992‚Äì1993 =Former Yugoslavia (1992‚Äì2007)= New Zealand's commitment to the Balkan states commenced in 1992 with the deployment of five soldiers as UN Military Observers serving with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). In 1994 New Zealand committed the first of two Company Groups of mechanised infantry serving as part of British battalions. These were termed OP RADIAN. When this commitment was withdrawn New Zealand continued to commit 12 to 15 artillery and armoured soldiers to the British contingent, as well as three Staff Officers to the NATO Stabilisation Force (SFOR). As the mission evolved, the New Zealand contingent changed to a Liaison and Observation Team in the Bosnian town of Preijedor. The contribution was maintained through the handover of the NATO SFOR mission to the European Union EUFOR Althea on 2 December 2004. The LOT was withdrawn on 5 April 2007 but the three staff officers, the last in a continuous 15-year contribution to the peacekeeping effort in the former Yugoslavia, departed on 29 June 2007. One member was seriously wounded during this period. =East Timor (1999‚Äì2003, 2006)= New Zealand Special Air Service escorting a port survey team in East Timor, 1999. Following East Timor's vote for independence in 1999, the Australian-led INTERFET (International Force East Timor) was deployed with the permission of the Indonesian Government in response to a complete breakdown in order. INTERFET was composed of contributions from 17 nations, about 9,900 in total. New Zealand's contribution in East Timor included SAS special forces, infantry battalion and helicopters, backed by RNZN warships and RNZAF transport. INTERFET was replaced by a United Nations mission (UNTAET ‚Äì United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor) which sought to move East Timor toward elections and self-government and the troops came under the command of UNTAET in late 2000, which was in turn replaced by UNMISET in 2002. At its peak, the New Zealand Defence Force had 1,100 personnel in East Timor ‚Äì New Zealand's largest overseas military deployment since the Korean War. Overall New Zealand's contribution saw just short of 4,000 New Zealanders serve in East Timor. In addition to their operations against militia, the New Zealand troops were also involved in construction of roads and schools, water supplies, training the nascent Timor Leste Defence Force (F-FDTL) and other infrastructural assistance. English lessons and medical aid were also provided. New Zealand Defence Force personnel were withdrawn in November 2002 leaving only a small training team for the F-FDTL. However, in May 2006 widespread fighting broke out in the Timorese capital of Dili as a result of a mass resignation of 591 soldiers and increasing tension between the F-FDTL and the East Timorese police (PNTL). A contingent of 120 troops were dispatched and provided security in Dili alongside soldiers and police from Australia, Malaysia and Portugal. Four New Zealand peacekeepers have been killed on operations in East Timor. =Solomon Islands (2003‚Äì2013)= New Zealanders a part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands on patrol, 2009. New Zealand participated in the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which aimed to restore peace following the Solomon Islands civil war. RAMSI acted as an interim police force and has been successful in improving the country's overall security conditions, including brokering the surrender of a notorious warlord, Harold Keke. New Zealand contributed four helicopters and about 230 personnel consisting of infantry, engineers, medical and support staff. RAMSI was scaled down in July 2004, as stability had gradually been restored to the country. It was now primarily a police force. In 2007, New Zealand forces provided support relief in the aftermath of the 2 April 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake. The Mission ended in August 2013. =Iraq, (2003‚Äìpresent)= The New Zealand government opposed and officially condemned the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite this, the frigate HMNZS Te Kaha (F77) and an RNZAF P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft were deployed to the Gulf, under US command.Helen Clark talks peace while aiding US war, Socialist Worker Monthly Review Supplement, March 2003 Royal New Zealand Engineers in Iraq, in 2004, after the US-led invasion in 2003. Following the invasion, later in 2003 New Zealand supplied a number of engineers and armed troops to the coalition effort. Task Group Rake, a Royal New Zealand Engineers group, joined Multi-National Division South East for one year under British Army command.Nicky Hager, Other People's Wars: New Zealand in Afghanistan, Iraq and the War on Terror, Craig Potton Publishing, Nelson, NZ; ; 2011 Cables leaked by WikiLeaks in 2010 suggested New Zealand had only done so in order to keep valuable Oil for Food contracts. In accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 New Zealand also contributed a small engineering and support force to assist in post-war reconstruction and provision of humanitarian aid. The engineers returned home in October 2004, but liaison and staff officers remained in Iraq working with coalition forces. As of 2012, one military observer from New Zealand was serving as part of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq. On the 10th anniversary of the invasion, New Zealand journalist Jon Stephenson ‚Äì who was in Baghdad when the war began ‚Äì said New Zealand's contribution to the recovery effort had been \\"grossly overstated\\". =Tonga (2006)= On 18 November 2006, a contingent of seventy-two New Zealand Defence Force personnel and additional New Zealand Police officers was deployed to Tonga at the Tongan Government's request to assist in the restoration of calm after an outbreak of violence in the nation's capital, Nukualofa. They were joined by Australian soldiers and Australian Federal Police officers. Their main objective is to assist the Tongan forces in protecting Tonga's international airport in Nukualofa. The personnel returned on 2 December. Antarctica RNZAF Boeing at Pegasus Field on the Ross Ice Shelf in 2009. New Zealand's armed forces have been involved in Antarctic research and exploration since the 1950s. The Air Force operated two Auster T7 and a Beaver in Antarctica in the late 1950s, the Austers somewhat unsuccessfully. The navy has escorted supply ships and conducted its own supply missions, provided weather monitoring and support for U.S. activities in the 'frozen continent', conducted scientific research, and helped build Scott Base. In 1964, 40 Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force, was re-equipped with the C-130H Hercules and, the following year, commenced regular flights to and from the Antarctic. The army, and later the other two services, have provided cargo handlers. No. 5 Squadron has operated in the airspace over and near Scott Base to provide search and rescue standby and to drop mail and medical supplies to the people wintering over.

Films  * First Cousin Once Removed, (2013), an intimate yet unsettling portrait of distinguished poet and translator, Edwin Honig‚ÄîBerliner's friend, cousin, and former mentor‚Äîhad its world premiere at the 2012 New York Film Festival. The film, which chronicles Honig's journey through memory loss and Alzheimer's disease, then went on to screen in Europe at IDFA (International Film Festival Amsterdam), where it won the Grand Prize For Feature Length Documentary Film. In announcing the award, the IDFA documentary jury wrote, ‚ÄúAlan Berliner employs intelligence, inventiveness, and a poetic sensibility to create a film that uses the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs to make a beautiful, moving, and artistic statement about the intersection of personal history and memory.‚ÄùFirst Cousin Once Removed was broadcast on HBO in September of 2013, and was nominated for a Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Documentary of the year. It was also nominated for Cinema Eye Honors Awards in Outstanding Achievement in Direction and Outstanding Achievement in Editing, and was short-listed for a 2014 Documentary Oscar Nomination. Berliner‚Äôs earlier short film about Edwin Honig, Translating Edwin Honig: A Poet‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs, premiered at the 2010 New York Film Festival, and won the prize for ‚ÄúBest Documentary Short‚Äù at the 2011 Punto de Vista Film Festival in Pamplona, Spain. * Wide Awake, which received its world premiere at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and its international premiere at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival, is Berliner's most personal film. An idiosyncratic and cinematically innovative essay exploring Berliner's lifelong obsession with insomnia, Wide Awake ultimately reveals‚Äîin ways both hilarious and deeply personal‚Äîhow sleeplessness has profoundly impacted the delicate relationship between his creative life and family responsibility. ‚ÄúBerliner‚Ä¶ has the gift of addressing intimate subjects and making them universal.‚Äù wrote Variety, ‚ÄúNowhere has he done this better than with ‚ÄúWide Awake.‚Äù Wide Awake received its American television premiere on HBO in May 2007. * The Sweetest Sound, which premiered to sold-out audiences at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, is a serio-comic essay film exploring the power, meaning and mystery of people's names. TimeOut, London called it \\"... an excellent film... a classic example of what eccentric, heavily authored documentary making is all about.\\" The Austin Chronicle described it as \\"charming and brilliant... a beautifully constructed work in which every element is carefully considered and gracefully executed... funny and wise and provocative.\\" HybridMagazine.com noted that, \\"...Berliner is on his way to becoming the film world's leading documentarian on the intricacies of ordinary life and family.\\" The Sweetest Sound received its American television premiere on \\"P.O.V.,\\" in June, 2001, making Berliner the first filmmaker ever to present four films on that highly acclaimed documentary series. * Nobody's Business is an unflinchingly honest portrait of Berliner's reclusive (and stubbornly resistant) father Oscar; a film that finds humor and pathos in the swirl of conflicts and affections that bind father and son. Since its premiere at the New York Film Festival in 1996, the film has won twelve international awards and prizes, including both the \\"Caligari Film Prize\\" and the \\"International Film Critics Association Prize\\" at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival, the Grand Prize at the 1997 Visions Du Reel Documentary Film Festival in Nyon, Switzerland, and an award for \\"Innovation in Cinema\\" from the 1997 Festival dei Popoli in Florence, Italy. In the summer of 1997, Nobody's Business was selected to launch the 10th anniversary broadcast season of \\"P.O.V.,\\" for which it later received an Emmy Award. Nobody's Business has been shown at more than 80 festivals, museums, conferences and universities. It has been the subject of feature articles in The New York Times, New York Magazine, The Independent, and The Austin Chronicle, and has been critically acclaimed in publications ranging from The Atlanta Constitution to The Denver Post, from The Nation, to USA Today. In the December, 1996 edition of Film Comment, author Phillip Lopate wrote, \\"I know of no one working in personal films today who can do so well what Alan Berliner does: bring dramatically alive the intense agon and ambivalence and love within families. His dazzling technical mastery of the relation between sound and image is always kept in the service of deep psychological truths.\\" * Intimate Stranger (1991) explores the extraordinary life story of Berliner's maternal grandfather Joseph Cassuto, a Palestinian Jew raised in Egypt whose lifelong passion for Japan created confusion and conflict in his post-World War II Brooklyn home. Following its premiere at the 1991 New York Film Festival, it was invited to many film festivals, museums, universities and film showcases all over the world, winning several awards and prizes, including an Emmy nomination by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and a 1993 Distinguished Achievement Award from the International Documentary Association. The Washington Post called Intimate Stranger \\"a brilliant, one of a kind film... funny, probing... so wholly original in both style and substance as to seem completely without precedent... intoxicating to watch... a spectacular high wire feat by a master.\\" * Berliner first achieved recognition with a group of innovative avant-garde films made between 1975 and 1985. But it was his first hour-long experimental documentary film, The Family Album (1986), winner of awards and prizes at film festivals around the world, which placed him at the forefront of experimental documentary filmmaking. In THE FAMILY ALBUM, which was included as part of the 1987 Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibition, Berliner used a vast collection of anonymous 16mm home movies (belonging to more than 75 different families) from the 1920s to the 1950s to create a universal yet intimate composite portrait of the American family. Hailed as \\"the most intriguing film\\" of the 1987 Edinburgh International Film Festival by critic Roger Ebert, the film was shown on PBS as part of the P.O.V. series, as well as on The BRAVO Network and The Learning Channel.  Artwork  In addition to his work in film, Berliner has also produced a substantial body of photographic, audio and video installation works. His early \\"para-cinematic\\" photographs, scrolls and collages were exhibited at the Hunter College Art Gallery, The Collective for Living Cinema, and The Munson Williams Proctor Institute in the early eighties. Cine-Matrix (1977) part of an exhibition titled, Franes: Two Dimensional Work by Film Artists, held at the Hunter College Art Gallery in 1980 was reviewed in Art Forum.

His video sculpture, Late City Edition (1993) was shown as part of a curated exhibition titled, The Concrete Signal: Video as Sculpture at Gallery 148 in October, 1993, and at the Fine Arts Gallery at Wake Forest University in February, 1995. A selection of his audio/video installation work was included as part of the curated exhibition, Body & Technology: International Technology Art in June 1995, held at the Dong Ah Gallery in Seoul, Korea. Audiofile (1993) and Aviary (1993), both ground- breaking interactive audio installations were exhibited at the Walter Reade Theater Gallery at Lincoln Center and at Anthology Film Archives (Seoul/Nymax) in 1994. His first one-person exhibition, Found Sound: Audio & Video Installation Works featuring the premieres of Critical Mass (1996) and The Red Thread (1996), was held at Sculpture Center Gallery in New York City in March 1996. Berliner's interactive video installation, Gathering Stones (1999), based on the tradition of placing rocks on tombstones when visiting Jewish cemeteries, was commissioned for the exhibition, To The Rescue, Eight Artists in an Archive, which premiered at the International Center of Photography Midtown in New York City in February, 1999, and will travel to art museums in Miami, Houston and San Francisco. His second one-person exhibition, The Art of War, held at The Stephen Gang Gallery in March, 1999, featured an innovative interactive sound/image interface using images projected from the ceiling onto a \\"screen\\" composed of 150 small white audio speakers arranged in a grid on the gallery floor. In 2002, Berliner was an artist in residence at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, where his interactive multi-media installation, The Language of Names opened in February 2002 and ran through October 2002. He was also commissioned to create a large-scale interactive sculpture based on Gathering Stones for Holocaust Museum Houston which was on exhibition from March through August 2002.

On a personal level, he struggled with insomnia most of his life leading to a domino effect of painful challenges associated with always feeling tired and zombie-like. His relationship with late evening hours is conflicting because on one hand, it‚Äôs the time of day he‚Äôs most tortured struggling to fall asleep tossing and turning in turmoil, however, on the other hand, it‚Äôs the time he feels most invigorated and creative allowing him to create all of his films. As a result of this, Alan created all his films in the night.

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Peers completed an undergraduate degree in languages at the University of British Columbia in 1956 and a diploma in translation at the University of Heidelberg in 1957. He had intended to embark on a career in diplomacy. In the meantime, an interest in religion which had begun in his youth after a non-religious upbringing, increased and he decided to seek ordination. He entered Trinity College at the University of Toronto where he obtained a licentiate in theology. He was ordained as an Anglican priest and served in the following positions: *Curate of Holy Trinity, Ottawa, in 1963 *Rector of St. Bede's, Winnipeg, 1965 *Archdeacon of Winnipeg, River North Anglican Parishes, Winnipeg, 1971 *Dean of Qu'Appelle (Regina, Saskatchewan) and rector of St. Paul's Cathedral, Regina, 1976 - 1978 *Bishop of Qu'Appelle (Regina, Saskatchewan), 1976 - 1986 *Archbishop of Qu'Appelle and Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert's Land, 1981-1986 *Primate of Canada, 1986 - 2004 Peers speaks English, French, Spanish, German and Russian. He is married with three children and four grandchildren. He currently resides in Toronto, Ontario where he is Ecumenist-in-Residence at the Toronto School of Theology. In 2006 his Grace Notes: Journeying With the Primate, 1995-2004 (), a collection of his monthly columns in the Anglican Journal, was published, and in 2007 his The Anglican Episcopate in Canada: Volume IV, 1977-2007. Peers is now confessor to the monastery of the Society of St. John the Evangelist in Boston. He is also Ecumenist in Residence at the Toronto School of Theology. Ministry on the prairies Having come from a background that might have suggested to prairie folk that he was an \\"eastern\\" √©litist, Peers quickly established himself as keen sympathiser with the ideals of prairie populism. Rural Saskatchewanians quickly perceived that Peers was their ardent supporter‚Äîthat the ideals of prairie populism were his own ideals‚Äîand that his obvious membership in the Canadian √©lite was entirely to their advantage. The life of a prairie bishop is one of endless travel along the highways and byways of the prairie hinterland: in the course of such travels Peers made long and lasting friendships with many members of the Saskatchewan leadership, as with many grassroots Saskatchewanians, and these friendships amply informed the national and worldwide ministry of his primacy. Major events of his primacy Major events include: *the introduction of the Book of Alternative Services (to supplement ‚Äî but in effect replace ‚Äî the Book of Common Prayer, and over the objections of the Prayer Book Society of Canada, which unsuccessfully litigated the matter in an ecclesiastical court over which Archbishop Peers presided); *the achieving of full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (in which he played a pivotal role); *the formal apology to native peoples for the abuses which occurred in the Residential Schools; *financial settlement with the federal government over aboriginal claims against native residential schools operated on the government's behalf principally by Anglican and Roman Catholic churches; *en route to the 1978 Lambeth Conference touched down in the newly independent Solomon Islands and the then-North Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea though it was Roman Catholic and United Church, to the former of which he and Mrs. Peers returned, having established friendly relations and later as Primate sending a bishop; *the stand taken by the Anglican Church in 1986 in support of Canada's northern people, who depended on the seal hunt, against the international animal rights lobby; towards the end of his tenure, *the emergence of the issue of the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy (which he supported); and *his presidency of the Metropolitan Council of Cuba (a council that oversees the episcopal work of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Cuba, once a part of the Episcopal Church in the United States which is because of US government policy no longer able to take any role there); *his cultivation of a much closer relationship between the Anglican Church of Canada and the Episcopal Church of the United States.

Throughout an 'industrial' early period, Geoffroy tended to write a fusion of martial music and dark ambient. Choosing to focus on atmosphere, militaristic rhythms, and historical samples, he left little emphasis to be placed on vocals and melody. However, with the release of his 2003 effort, Les Blessures de l'Ombre, Geoffroy took a new direction, applying his martial style to verse-chorus song structures and pop melodies. In 2008, Geoffroy started an electronic side-project called Position Parall√®le which fused together EBM with minimal wave style sounds. This led to a more distinctly synthpop sound being carried over into his work as Derni√®re Volont√© as well. His 2016 album, Prie Pour Moi, shifted his sound toward more neofolk instrumentation with less emphasis on synthesizers. A new Position Parall√®le album, titled En Garde √† Vue, was released in 2017. Geoffroy is featured as a guest artist on the Der Blutharsch albums, with Nov√Ω Svƒõt and Die Krupps. The band still plays occasional live shows.

The series lasted for two series between 2001 and 2002 and was created by comedian Tim Ferguson. Ferguson starred along with Matthew Dyktynski, Michael Veitch, Tom Budge, Rod Mullinar, Sancia Robinson, Fiona Todd and Cassandra Magrath, with many well-known Australian actors and comedians in guest roles. Tiriel Mora joined the second season. It focused on an Australian talkback radio station, CHAT-AM, in the 1980s. The introduction of FM radio in the early 1980s was leading to the slow demise of the AM band. CHAT-AM discovered shock jock Barry Gold (Matthew Dyktynski) and its fortunes were reversed as the station transformed into a popular tabloid show. Shock Jock was the first original series produced for TV1. The series was produced by Mockingbird and Mondayitis Productions and was distributed by Foster Gracie TV.

It contains both covers and previously unreleased originals.  Track listing  = B-sides =  About the songs  # \\"Jimmy Neutron Theme\\" from Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures' Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius film, released in 2001. # \\"(Ready or Not) Omaha, Nebraska\\" from ESPN's College World Series. Jaret Reddick of Bowling for Soup admits to writing this in 5 minutes, and says \\"Everyone at ESPN is crazy!!!\\" # \\"Greatest Day\\" Originally written for an EA Sports video game (but rejected), the song has been featured in Fox's Malcolm in the Middle, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, Max Keeble's Big Move, Re- Animated, the Disney Channel original film Go Figure, the Nickelodeon TV film The Last Day of Summer, and the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen film Getting There. # \\"...Baby One More Time\\" This song was written into the movie Freaky Friday after much of the actual movie had already been written. Because the song is written into the dialogue, Bowling for Soup was asked to cover the song at a given tempo. Reddick says, \\"We couldn't do our usual 'speed it up and add harmonies and it will sound like BFS' approach.\\" # \\"Here We Go\\" from Scooby- Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed; this song was originally written by Tim Armstrong of The Transplants, Operation Ivy, and Rancid. # \\"Undertow\\" While the band decided to pass up adding this song to their A Hangover You Don't Deserve album, it was featured on the Summerland soundtrack. Reddick says, \\"I don't have a copy of that [Summerland] soundtrack, but I am guessing this is one of the strongest tracks on it.\\" # \\"Spanish Harlem\\" This is the one of only three tracks (excluding the two new tracks), which was not featured on any television show or movie, as a series starring Luis Guzm√°n passed on the song. # \\"Li'l Red Riding Hood\\" The movie Cursed opened with this song. # \\"Live It Up\\" This song is a demo, written with Diiorio using a hook from an unreleased track from Diiorio's band Valve, and is not in any television shows or movies. It was submitted to be on the soundtrack for Shrek 2 but ultimately lost to Counting Crows' \\"Accidentally in Love\\". # \\"Star Song\\" While this song is not in any television shows or movies, it is one of the band's favorite songs and it appears on the re-issue of Drunk Enough to Dance, and as a B-side on the \\"Punk Rock 101\\" single release in the UK. # \\"I Melt with You\\" Featured in the movie Sky High, the song has now been released as the single from the album. Bowling for Soup was asked to cover it by Music Supervisor Lisa Brown, who also asked the band to cover \\"...Baby One More Time\\". Though they were a little apprehensive about covering a song that not only has been covered so many times before, but is also a \\"classic\\" to the band, they eventually agreed. Bowling for Soup's version has also changed the second line of the song to be more appropriate for children. # \\"Five O'Clock World\\" The theme of several episodes of Drew Carey Show from 2002 to 2004.

Swan was a brand of soap introduced by the Lever Brothers Company in 1941 to compete with Ivory. Swan was advertised as a soap that could be used in the kitchen as a hand soap or in the bathroom to bathe the baby. Swan, like Ivory, was a floating soap, but Lever had developed and patented a new manufacturing method that both streamlined the process and resulted in a finer product more like milled soap. A typical advertisement boasted that Swan was \\"the white floating soap that's purer than the finest castiles\\". Lever and Procter & Gamble became embroiled in litigation over the process and products of it. Lever sued Procter & Gamble for patent infringement after the format of Ivory changed; the Appellate Court found that the patent had been infringed and Procter & Gamble were required to pay $5.675 million to Lever. Lever Brothers used the Swan brand name to sponsor several radio programs, notably The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (1941‚Äì1945), Joanie's Tea Room (1945‚Äì1947), The Bob Hope Show (1948‚Äì1949), and My Friend Irma (1947‚Äì1951). Swan's print ads were colorful works of art, and often featured children, babies, soapsuds and, of course, a swan. Some people had the Swan soap ad prints displayed on their wall at home. The art prints were made available to the public as promotional items by the company. Swan Soap is no longer marketed. Lawsuits In 1972, Gladys Young sued the manufacturer of Swan liquid dishwashing detergent, Lever Brothers, and the manufacturer's insurer for damages because of skin irritation allegedly caused by her use of the product between 1968-70. She testified that a week or two after she started using Swan, The detergent dried out her fingers and they began to itch around the nails. When her nails began to recede within two or three months, Mrs. Young reflected upon the cause and theorized that the change to Swan could have been responsible for the condition. The district court dismissed her suit after a trial on the merits on September 26, 1973. However, publicity from the trial hurt sales and Swan Detergent was discontinued by 1974.

Ethnomycology is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi and can be considered a subfield of ethnobotany or ethnobiology. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as tinder, medicine (medicinal mushrooms) and food (including yeast), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as psilocybin mushrooms, the Amanita muscaria mushroom, and the ergot fungus. American banker Robert Gordon Wasson pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom velada, held by the Mazatec curandera Mar√≠a Sabina. The biologist Richard Evans Schultes is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer. Later researchers in the field include Terence McKenna, Albert Hofmann, Ralph Metzner, Carl Ruck, Blaise Daniel Staples, Giorgio Samorini, Keewaydinoquay Peschel, John Marco Allegro, Clark Heinrich, Jonathan Ott, Paul Stamets, and Juan Camilo Rodr√≠guez Mart√≠nez. Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on anthropology and philology. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda of the Indo-Aryans was the Amanita muscaria mushroom. Following his example similar attempts have been made to identify psychoactive mushroom usage in many other (mostly) ancient cultures, with varying degrees of credibility. Another much written about topic is the content of the Kykeon, the sacrament used during the Eleusinian mysteries in ancient Greece between approximately 1500 BCE and 396 CE. Although not an ethnomycologist as such, philologist John Allegro has made an important contribution suggesting, in a book controversial enough to have his academic career destroyed, that Amanita muscaria was not only consumed as a sacrament but was the main focus of worship in the more esoteric sects of Sumerian religion, Judaism and early Christianity. Clark Heinrich claims that Amanita muscaria use in Europe was not completely wiped out by Orthodox Christianity but continued to be used (either consumed or merely symbolically) by individuals and small groups such as medieval Holy Grail myth makers, alchemists and Renaissance artists. While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the shamanic or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying psychedelic mushrooms as the original \\"Tree of Knowledge\\". There is indeed some research supporting the theory that psilocybin ingestion temporarily increases neurochemical activity in the language centers of the brain, indicating a need for more research into the uses of psychoactive plants and fungi in human history. The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of psilocybin mushrooms due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the rave culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the Internet. This \\"mushrooming of mushroom use\\" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in Christmas and fairy tale symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far- reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

Born in San Sebasti√°n (Guip√∫zcoa, Spain), later on he was a naturalized US citizen. After conducting in Madrid, Cape Town and Antwerp, he was music director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1954 to 1963. He made several stereophonic recordings in San Francisco for RCA Victor in 1957 and 1958. He made several highly acclaimed recordings for Decca in the late 1940s and early 1950s of Spanish music with the London Symphony Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra and Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, including two recordings of Nights in The Gardens of Spain with Clifford Curzon as soloist. Several of these have been reissued on the Dutton label. During his tenure in San Francisco he gave the world premiere of Joaquin Rodrigo's Fantasia para un Gentilhombre with Andr√©s Segovia as the soloist. Mr. Jorda made recordings with both the San Francisco Symphony and the Symphony of the Air, several of which have recently been reissued on CD. His third recording of Nights in the Garden of Spain was made with the San Francisco Orchestra with Arthur Rubinstein as soloist. His final recordings with the orchestra were for CRI in 1962. After he left San Francisco, he was a guest conductor in Europe, South America and Australia. He published a book on conducting, \\"El Director de Orquesta Ante la Partitura,\\" in 1969, and from 1970 to 1976 was the music director of the Antwerp Philharmonic Orchestra (now: Antwerp Symphony Orchestra). During the San Francisco Symphony's 1973 European tour, the musicians were reunited with Jord√° for the final time. Jord√° died at 84 in Brussels, Belgium following a two-month illness related to a blood transfusion. His daughter Tessa, who married Sir David Brewer, has been awarded the OBE.

King subsequently published a number of best-selling works. King's spiritual orientation increased later in his life. His The Abolishing of Death (1919) described the transmission of messages from a deceased chemist. The Conquest of Fear (1921) portrayed his own struggle with ill health and eventual spiritual growth, and lays out his somewhat mystical approach to religious understanding. Critics often faulted King's fiction for its sentimentality and didacticism. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 22, 1928. Quotes \\"Go at it boldly, and you'll find unexpected forces closing round you and coming to your aid.\\"Basil King, 1921, The Conquest of Fear, Garden City Publishing, p. 29 sometimes cited as \\"Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.\\"See for example, the Cameron Crowe film, Almost Famous, which misattributes the phrase to Goethe.

Between 2007 and 2010, she was the member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Bennelong, New South Wales. Until 2007, the seat was held by the then Prime Minister John Howard, who had been the member for 33 years. She was only the second person to unseat a sitting Australian prime minister since Jack Holloway defeated Stanley Bruce in 1929; and the third person to unseat the leader of a major party, after Neville Newell defeated Charles Blunt, leader of the National Party, in 1990. At the 2010 Federal election she lost her seat to the Liberal Party candidate, John Alexander. Before entering politics, McKew was an award- winning broadcast journalist. She hosted a number of programmes on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television and radio, most recently Lateline and The 7.30 Report. Personal McKew was born and grew up in Brisbane, Queensland where her father, Bryan McKew, was a boilermaker. When McKew was five, her mother Elaine died, and McKew was sent to live with her grandparents for three years. McKew and her sister Margo moved to Moorooka to live with their father after he remarried; later attending All Hallows' School in Brisbane. McKew currently lives in the Sydney suburb of Epping with her partner, former ALP National Secretary Bob Hogg. McKew is Roman Catholic and Hogg is divorced; consequently, they have chosen not to marry. McKew had previously indicated active plans to move into the electorate of Bennelong, before doing so in March 2007. On 3 March 2007, allegations of death threats against McKew were widely reported. There has been speculation that attempts to tamper with her car were by car thieves looking for spare parts rather than by politically motivated individuals. Media career After graduating from high school, she briefly attended university before dropping out and living in London for two years. She supported herself with a variety of temporary jobs, including relief typing at a London BBC office. A letter requesting a job‚Äîwritten by McKew on BBC letterhead paper‚Äîwas rewarded with a cadetship at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in Brisbane in 1974 following a brief stint as a news analyst at the investment bank Goldman Sachs. In 1976 she moved on to host This Day Tonight, a local current affairs program. McKew appeared as herself in the eighth episode of the first series, and in the sixth episode of the second series of the Australia television series The Games. In over 30 years working at the ABC, McKew worked as a presenter on the 7:30 Report and Lateline, and also worked on The Carleton-Walsh Report, AM, PM, and The Bottom Line. McKew was honoured for her broadcasting work with a Logie award, and for her journalism by a Walkley Award. In October 2006 she announced that she was leaving the ABC saying \\"This is more than likely the end of my broadcasting career\\". From 1999 to 2004 she wrote Lunch with Maxine McKew, a column for The Bulletin, a weekly magazine, based on her interviews with prominent Australians. McKew frequently elicited newsworthy revelations from her subjects, and was named by The Australian Financial Review as \\"one of the top ten exercisers of covert power in Australia\\". Following her election as the member for Bennelong in 2007, the Canberra Times had a photo of McKew in a Basic Instinct moment, referring to the scene where Sharon Stone was allegedly not wearing underwear. =Honours= * 1998 Walkley Award for Broadcast Interviewing for her work on Lateline * 1999 Logie Award for Most Outstanding News-Public Affairs Broadcaster * Named as \\"Columnist of the Year\\" by the Magazine Publishers Association in 2003. Politics Bennelong at the 2007 federal election. A polling booth in Epping at the 2007 federal election in Bennelong. McKew was reported to have been a possible Labor candidate for the safe federal seat of Fowler at both the 2001 and 2004 elections. In 2004, it was the Labor leader Mark Latham who attempted to lure McKew with preselection to the western Sydney seat. Latham recorded in his diary that his efforts failed because the broadcaster would not move from her home in Mosman to Labor's outer-suburban heartland, an area which he represented as the Member for Werriwa, while McKew told ABC Radio that a big factor in her 2003 decision was that she regarded the party as being without direction at the time. McKew had also been approached by John Hewson in the past to join the Liberal Party. After resigning from the ABC in December 2006, McKew joined the Australian Labor Party in January 2007 as a special adviser on strategy to Labor leader Kevin Rudd. The Australian reported in early February that McKew was again in contention to gain preselection for the Division of Fowler, a safe Labor seat held by Julia Irwin who had supported Kim Beazley in the December leadership ballot. However the article also stated that a Labor source had suggested that a different seat was possible. =Contest for the seat of Bennelong= On 25 February Rudd's office confirmed that McKew would run against Prime Minister John Howard in the Division of Bennelong at the election, and McKew announced that she and Hogg were selling their Mosman home. The seat had once been a Liberal stronghold (it had been in Liberal hands since its creation in 1949), but it had shifted increasingly to Labor in recent years. Howard had held the seat since 1974, but in two out of the three elections he had fought since becoming prime minister, he'd needed to go to preferences to win another term in his own seat. McKew outlined her position on issues such as the environment, education and women in The Bulletin in mid-2007. Following a redistribution in 2006, the already marginal Liberal seat had become slightly more so, with Labor needing a swing of 4 percent to win it. This placed Bennelong just barely on the edge of seats that would likely fall to Labor in the event it won government. However, much of the area was already represented by Labor at the state level. A previous week's Morgan poll conducted for the website Crikey put Labor's two-party preferred vote in the seat at 55%. The state of play in the battle for the electorate, as it was on 12 October 2007, had leaked polls showing McKew with an edge over the incumbent. On 24 November 2007, it was obvious when the first returns came in that the contest would be very tight. The ABC and several other sources projected Bennelong as a Labor gain,Bennelong ‚Äì Federal Election 2007 ‚Äì ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) and Howard himself said in conceding the election to Rudd that it was \\"very likely\\" he had been unseated. However, McKew hesitated to claim victory, saying that the seat was on a \\"knife edge.\\" In a press conference held on 26 November, McKew declared Bennelong \\"a Labor seat for the first time\\", but stopped short of formally claiming victory. Earlier Antony Green said there was \\"no doubt\\" McKew had won. On 1 December 2007, while counting was still under way, McKew formally claimed victory in Bennelong, saying that she was \\"comfortably ahead\\" on the two-party vote. In her victory speech, McKew thanked Howard for his 30 years of service and could understand why he hadn't formally conceded, saying that \\"Mr. Howard and his family clearly had a huge amount to do this week.\\" She said that her polling numbers indicated a uniform swing to Labor, with many people who had never voted Labor before crossing over to her. However, she said that many voters felt neglected by him in recent years. By most estimates Howard would have needed an improbable majority of the outstanding mail-in and absentee ballots to retain his seat. It was not until 12 December that Howard formally conceded defeat, with the Electoral Commission formally declaring McKew the winner by 44,685 votes (51.4 percent) to Howard's 42,251 (48.6 percent). The final tally indicated that McKew had won victory on the 14th count due to a large flow of Green preferences to her; 3,793 (78.84 percent) of Green voters listed McKew as their second preference.Two Candidate Preferred Preference Flow This was enough for her to defeat Howard by 2.8 percentage points on the two-party vote.Division Distribution of Preferences =Appointment as a Parliamentary Secretary= A few days earlier, on 29 November, Rudd announced that McKew would be one of his Parliamentary Secretaries when his ministryThe 42nd Parliament ‚Äì the ministry list was sworn in on 3 December. In this role she had responsibility for early childhood education and child care. Less than a week after the official declaration of her victory, McKew launched a book and described the Howard era of government as one characterised by \\"brutish\\" politics. Maxine McKew delivered her first speech in the House of Representatives on 14 February 2008.Votes and Proceedings Hansard 14Feb2008 On 6 June 2009, in a ministerial reshuffle brought on as a result of the resignations of the Defence Minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Senator Jan McLucas, Maxine McKew became Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. =Electoral defeat= McKew was defeated at the 2010 federal election, losing the seat of Bennelong to John Alexander, her opponent from the Liberal Party. She suffered a swing against her of more than 5 per cent, remarking as she conceded defeat that Labor's national campaign 'left a lot to be desired'. Post-political career McKew works for Social Ventures Australia, advising on education issues, and is a Vice Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Melbourne. In 2012, she wrote a political memoir entitled Tales from the Political Trenches. McKew's account of her life in politics is highly critical of the leadership decisions and internal culture of the Federal ALP. =Other interests= McKew is a long-term participant in the Australian-American Leadership Dialogue, a bipartisan bilateral civil diplomatic initiative founded by Melbourne businessman Phil Scanlan. She also serves as a Distinguished Fellow of the Australia India Institute. Her other activities include membership of the Women's Advisory Group to the National Breast Cancer Centre, and membership of the University of Sydney's Research Institute for Asia Pacific. She is a member of the Sydney Symphony Council, and was the Patron of Osteoporosis Australia.

Currently WNMT is owned by Midwest Communications. Midwest also owns five radio stations on the Iron Range; WMFG, WMFG-FM, WNMT, WTBX, and WUSZ. All five stations share the same studio location at 807 W. 37th Street, Hibbing. WNMT broadcasts a typical AM station pattern during the day which gives it good coverage over most of Northeastern Minnesota. However at nighttime, the station broadcasts a directional pattern from five towers which makes it difficult to receive south of the immediate Iron Range. This is done to protect signals to the south broadcasting on the same frequency; particularly clear-channel station WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. History The initial broadcast over WNMT is thought to have been that of the assassination of Presidential contender Robert F. Kennedy the previous night, June 5, 1968. The former WNMT station broadcast from dawn to dusk nearly every day, and broadcast a variety of family-oriented programming. The owner and operator was an elderly (now deceased) gentleman, surname Watkins, (date of birth contested). Before changing its callsign to WNMT, 650 AM Hibbing was WKKQ. WKKQ signed on the air on June 1, 1975 at 1060 AM with a clear channel daytime-only signal. The station was variously known as \\"The Super Q\\" and \\"Clear Channel Country\\". The first song played was John Denver's \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\\". The station signed off at sunset with a special arrangement of \\"Happy Trails to You\\" ending with \\"Happy trails to you from WKKQ\\". WKKQ was affiliated with the United Press Radio news and provided strong local news and community calendars to compete with Hibbing's pioneer station WMFG. The station moved to 650 AM in the mid-1980s and was allowed to broadcast on reduced power from sunset to sunrise. At one point in time, the station also broadcast in AM Stereo. The move to 650 kHz coincided with a switch to ABC Radio and WKKQ took Paul Harvey from WMFG. In early 1998, the call letters were changed to the current WNMT, followed by a format change in April 1998.

The title is placed before the Christian name, as in Mar Aprem/Mor Afrem (Ephrem the Syrian) and Marth/Morth Maryam (Mary, mother of Jesus). The variant Maran or Moran (, '), meaning \\"Our Lord\\", is a particular title given to Jesus, either alone or in combination with other names and titles. Likewise, Martan or Mortan (, ', \\"Our Lady\\") is a title of Mary, mother of Jesus. Occasionally, the term Maran or Moran has been used of various Eastern Christian patriarchs and catholicoi, who started using it in the recent centuries. The Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, the Malankara Orthodox Catholicos use the title Moran Mor. Sometimes the Indian bearers of this title are called Moran Mar, using a hybrid style from both Syriac dialects that reflects somewhat the history of Syrian Christians in Kerala. The Pope of Rome is referred to as Mar Papa by the Saint Thomas Christians of India. The obscure variant Marya or Moryo (, ') is used in the Peshitta Old Testament to render the Tetragrammaton. Although this word is clearly a derived form of the above, there is a fanciful derivation found in early Syriac lexica, that the word is an initialism as follows: * ‚Äî , ', 'lordship' * ‚Äî , ', 'majesty' * ‚Äî , ', 'self-existence' In Mishnaic Hebrew through to date this Aramaic word is pronounced [mar] (), and it is used as a formal way of addressing or referring to a male person. In the Gemara, Tabyomi is sometimes referred to as Mar.Bacher, Wilhelm. \\"Tabyomi.\\" JewishEncyclopedia.com. 1906. 30 July 2018. \\"Mar\\" was also the title of the Exilarch (leader of the Jewish diaspora community in Babylon), with the Aramaic-speaking Jews sharing many cultural attributes with the Syriac Christians. In the Modern Hebrew of contemporary Israel, \\"Mar\\" is used without distinction for any male person, like \\"Mr.\\" in English. However, in Rabbanical circles of Jews from the Middle East, the Aramaic variant form ◊û÷∏◊®÷∏◊ü (Maran, Aramaic: our lord) is still a title to used for highly appreciated Rabbis, such as Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the Shas party.\\"The life of Maran Ovadia Yosef, of Blessed and Holy Memory\\" - Hebrew-language obituary and biography on \\"Kooker\\", an Israeli religious news website See also *Syriac Christianity *Syriac language References * Category:Aramaic words and phrases Category:Syriac Christianity Category:Ecclesiastical styles Category:Syriac language ","title":"Mar"},{"id":"3674969","text":"WSGA may refer to: * WSGA (FM), a radio station (92.3 FM) licensed to Hinesville, Georgia, United States * WSEG, a radio station (1400 AM) in Savannah, Georgia, United States, which held the call sign WSGA from 1956 to 1999 * WTHG, a radio station (104.7 FM) in Hinesville, Georgia, United States, which held the call sign WSGA from 2002 to 2006 * WXYY, a radio station (100.1 FM) in Rincon, Georgia, United States, which briefly held the call sign WSGA in 2006 * Washington State Golf Association * Wyoming Stock Growers Association ","title":"WSGA"},{"id":"3674972","text":"Gargando is a small town located in the Tombouctou Region of Mali.

Its estimated 2008 population is 7000. The town lies due north of the regional capital of Koulikoro, and is connected by a 40 km all-weather road via the town of Sirakorola, about halfway between the two. It is the location of the Lyc√©e Franco-Arabe de Banamba. Physical layout It takes about twenty minutes to walk from one end to the other. There are old neighborhoods with narrow, winding alleys, and newer neighborhoods (particularly the NE) with a grid of wider streets. The market, the great mosque, the pharmacy, the post office, the Cercle building, the library, and the schools are all close together. Roads approach the town from all directions; the roads from Koulikoro (to the South) and from Kiban (to the East) are laterite. A line of ponds, dry before the rainy season, lies to the West of the market. Ethnic groups, customs Fulani women at the Monday market in Banamba The main ethnic groups found in Banamba are the Bambara, the Soninke, and the Fulani. The original settlers, whose family names are Simpara and Makaji, are related to the Soninke. Everyone speaks Bambara except some of the bush people, particularly Fulani, who come in to market on Mondays, though other languages can be heard, including Moor. On holidays (Muhammad's birthday and baptism, Ramadan, Tabaski) women dance to drums in various little corners around town. Sometimes on moonlit nights children dance to xylophone. Banamba has a day reserved for weddings in June each year, and on that day dozens of marriages take place. A day in March or April is marked for seining the fish out of the ponds. Until that day the fish are untouched. Then dozens of men and boys wade in with their homemade nets. Social life, sports There are several soccer teams that play regularly. People play basketball and volleyball and ping pong at the lyc√©e. Day to day social life consists mainly of walks around town chatting with passersby or making tea with family and friends. There are movies every night, including an occasional drama amid the karate spectacles. Dances are held at the school as often as once a month. Surrounding area Touba is within cycling distance. It is the home of a famous (so say the locals) Arabic school and a beautiful mosque on a hill. The town is divided by two Muslim sects (one of the Wahhabite) who do not get along well enough to share water. Kiban is also nearby and sports a pretty little mosque. Sirakola (Koulikoro Cercle) has a large market on Thursdays, on which days there is plenty of public transportation. There is a big hill to the West, visible from town, and a couple smaller ones about five kilometers to the North on the road to Nara. The hills to the North are piles of bare boulders, hosts to hardy baobabs, good for watching sunsets. Administrative structure Banamba town is the administrative center of Banamba Cercle, which contains nine Communes, including Banamba.

The commune has an area of approximately 491 square kilometers and includes the town and 20 of the surrounding villages.. In the 2009 census it had a population of 91,554. The town is the capital of the Niono Cercle, one of seven subdivisions (cercles) of the S√©gou Region. It lies on the northwest edge of the Inner Niger Delta, near the main channel of the Niger River. Office du Niger Niono is an important town of the Office du Niger irrigation scheme which was established during the last decades of French colonial rule and continued after independence by the Malian state.. Water from the Niger River is diverted into a system of canals at the Markala dam 35 km downstream of S√©gou. The water flows north for 65 km in the Canal du Sahel and is then used to irrigate the flat alluvial plains around Niono that form part of the 'Delta Mort' (Dead Delta). Although the French colonial administration constructed the system to produce cotton for the textile industry, the main agricultural product is now rice. Each year around 2.7 km3 of water are diverted from the Niger corresponding to 8.3 percent of the total flow. The water is used to irrigate about 750 square kilometers of farmland which in 1999/2000 produced 320,000 tonnes of rice representing 40 percent of the total Malian production. Architecture The Great Mosque of Niono is perhaps the most internationally recognized site in the town having received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1983.Great Mosque of Nonio , ArchNet Digital Library A mosque on the site was constructed in 1945 and then subsequently enlarged. The present building dates from 1973. The mosques of Djenn√© and Mopti served as models.. Development projects At least two major humanitarian projects have attempted to ameliorate the lives of people in Niono and the outlying areas. Led by American and Malian Rotary Clubs and Engineers Without Borders (USA) Chapters, the groups surveyed in February 2008 a rainwater drainage channel. The drainage channel, known as a \\"collecteur de pluies\\" in French, runs 2 kilometers through the city center. During the rainy season, flooding causes havoc, and during the rest of the year, the drainage channel becomes a breeding ground for disease. The intent of the project is to minimize both the flooding and the unsanitary stagnant water in the drainage channel. A new paved road of is under construction between Niono and Timbuktu running to the north of the Inland Niger Delta. The 565 km road will pass through Nampala, Niafunk√©, Tonka, Dir√© and Goundam. The completed 81 km section between Niono and the small village of Goma Coura in the commune of Dogofry. The village of Goma Coura is on the left bank of the Fala de Molodo at was financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation. This new section will service the Alatona irrigation system development of the 'Office du Niger'. The 484 km section between Goma Coura and Timbuktu is being financed by the European Development Fund. Climate The climate is influenced by the West African Monsoon. The average annual rainfall in the 35-year period between 1961 and 1995 was 504 mm, but there were large year-to-year fluctuations. In 1983, the driest year, only 291 mm fell, while in 1965, the wettest year, 820 mm was recorded. The rainfall normally only occurs between June and October.

History The club was established as Beaconsfield SYCOB in 1994 by a merger of Beaconsfield United of the Spartan League and Slough Youth Club Old Boys of the Chiltonian League, with the new club taking Beaconsfield United's place in the Premier Division of the Spartan League; Beaconsfield United had played in the Spartan League since 1979 and won the Senior Division in 1982‚Äì83, earning promotion to the Premier Division, whilst Slough Youth Club Old Boys had been members of the Chiltonian League since 1990. When the league merged with the South Midlands League to form the Spartan South Midlands League in 1997, Beaconsfield were placed in the Premier South Division, finishing as runners-up in the league's first season and earning a place in the Premier Division for the following season. In 2000‚Äì01 Beaconsfield won the Premier Division. After repeating this in 2003‚Äì04 they were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League. They were transferred to Division One West for the following season, which became Division One South & West for the 2006‚Äì07 season. However, after finishing bottom of the division that season, they were relegated back to the Spartan South Midlands League. The club won the league at the first attempt, and were promoted back to Division One South & West of the Southern League. The following season, 2008‚Äì09, saw them finish fourth, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 2‚Äì1 to AFC Totton in the semi-finals. In 2009 Beaconsfield were transferred to Division One Midlands, which became Division One Central the following season.

A Dhoni without lateen sails. A dhoni with lateen sails. Dhoni (also written as Thoni or Dhoney) is a traditional multi-purpose sailvessel with a motor or lateen sails that is used in the Maldives, South India and Sri Lanka. Varying in size and shape, they are used as fishing vessel, ferry, trading- and cargo ship.  Origin  = Etymology = The term dhoni has a Dravidian (Tamil-Malayalam) origin, derived from the root word tull meaning \\"to dig\\" because the early traditional dhonis were made from a scooped or dug out single log. = History = The traditional dhoni is one of the oldest known sea vessels in the Maldives. Many of these traditional sailing vessels were, of necessity, built using coconut palm timber. The sailing dhoni was used in earlier days by Maldivian fishermen. During the industrial revolution many fisherman changed to a mechanised dhoni. The Tamil, Kannada and Konkani word for a small boat is doni and the Malayalam word for a small boat is tuoni, perhaps due to the tradelinks between Arabs and the Konkani people in Goa and other port cities in Konkan and Coastal South West India.  Construction  Dhonis used to be built without plans. The master carpenter took measurements and gave instructions to the carpenters. Contemporary dhonis are often built using fibreglass. Dhonis fitted with diesel engines are extensively used on resort islands for scuba diving purposes, their low freeboard being ideal for this activity. The islands of the Maldives have an extensive fishing fleet of vessels built domestically, each of which carries eight to twelve persons. Nearly all of these are variants of the dhoni, a plank-built craft traditionally built with coconut timber, although imported wood from Southeast Asia is increasingly used. Originally sailing craft, nowadays these boats are usually fitted with motors. The main site for building dhonis is in Alifushi in Raa Atoll. Dhoni building is a traditional craft in the Maldives, and young apprentices are trained by skilled craftsmen. Boats crafted from timber take 60 days to complete.  Upgrades  Using a US$3.2 million loan from the International Development Association (IDA), most of the boats were mechanised during the 1980s. Although the addition of motors added fuel costs to operating expenses, it resulted in a doubling of the fishing catch between 1982 and 1985. Moreover, the 1992 catch of 82,000 tons set a record; for example, in 1987 the catch was 56,900 tons.  Usage  In 1995 there were 1674 registered fishing vessels in the Maldives. Of these, 1407 were motorised pole and line craft (masdhoni) for tuna fishing in coastal waters, five were sailing masdhoni, 48 were mechanised vadhudhoni, 209 were sailing vadhudhoni and 5 were rowboats used for trawling in reef waters.

Situated on the Newcastle railway line, it was serviced by Central Coast & Newcastle Line and Hunter Line services until its closure. Wickham, along with Civic station, succeeded Honeysuckle station, which was closed in 1872, following its own replacement by Newcastle station. Following urban growth in the Newcastle region, both Wickham and Civic were opened to meet the growing demand for public transport in the region. The station's signal box, located at the station's western end at Stewart Avenue, was replaced in the 1960s with a building recognised as Australia's first television-equipped level crossing. Plans to truncate the Newcastle railway line put the future of the station in doubt in the early 21st century, and despite upgrades to the station in 2007, a newly elected government in 2011 committed to the redevelopment of Newcastle's urban developments and public transport network, including the truncation of the Newcastle line past Stewart Avenue. The station was closed as a result, in December 2014, to make way for a redeveloped Wickham station and transport interchange, along with a new light rail network. The station structure was demolished in May 2017 to make way for the new light rail depot to be situated on the site. History =Background= Prior to Wickham and Civic stations, Honeysuckle railway station, which was located opposite Steel Street in Newcastle West (at ), originally serviced areas west of the central business district. It was first built as the passenger service terminus of the Newcastle railway line, and opened as Newcastle railway station in March 1857. While the new railway line was originally built with the express purpose of assisting the sea ports in the city, the original Newcastle railway station proved to be not close enough to adequately serve the ports, and thus the railway was extended further east, with a brand new Newcastle station opening in March 1858 as the line's new passenger terminus, and the former Newcastle station being renamed Honeysuckle station. The station was later renamed Honeysuckle Point station, before it was ultimately closed in 1872 and another station, , was opened two kilometers down the line towards the Main North railway line junction. While the station lay dormant for many years after its closure to passenger services, Honeysuckle was finally demolished in 1936, prior to the opening of Wickham and a year after the opening of station, though the sandstone foundations of the platforms remained in place through to their rediscovery during excavations for the Newcastle Light Rail project in July 2016. =Opening and operations= Extended 8-car platform at Wickham under construction in May 2007. In the years after Honeysuckle station's closure, Newcastle's population and urban development grew. As a response, two new stations on the Newcastle railway line were built, as Honeysuckle was demolished, to address the growing demand for transport ‚Äì Civic, which was built around 600 meters to the east, and Wickham, which was built 400 meters to the west. Wickham station was opened on 9 February 1936, two months after Civic station was opened. The station housed an important signal box, located at the station's eastern end, which controlled the entire length of the Newcastle railway line from Newcastle to Hamilton, where the signal box at Hamilton Junction takes over. The original signal box was built in 1928, and replaced in 1965 with a two-storey fibro signal box that was recognised as Australia's first television-equipped level crossing, being equipped with a closed-circuit television link between the box and the level crossing at Stewart Avenue, located at the station's western end. The station's structure remained largely the same for the rest of the 20th century. In 1992, a footbridge connecting the two platforms across the tracks, also located at the station's eastern end, was built, allowing access between the platforms. In 2007, a number of changes were made as part of the New South Wales Government's Newcastle Rail Corridor Project, a refurbishment campaign across the railway line designed to extend the life of the Newcastle railway line, described by contemporary media as a \\"backflip\\" for the Iemma Government, whom originally planned to close the line altogether. The changes included an extension of the station's southern platform to fit eight-car trains bound for Newcastle, new entrances to the station via the level crossing at Stewart Avenue, and an upgrade of the CCTV system at the crossing assisting the signal box. =Closure and redevelopment= The Newcastle railway line past Hamilton was closed on 25 December 2014, along with Wickham, Civic, and Newcastle stations. The decision by Transport for New South Wales under the O'Farrell Government, followed a decades-long public campaign to remove the rail line to allow open access to the Hunter River foreshore and to allow urban renewal projects to take place in the region. The cause, however, was not without controversy and opposition, with numerous efforts seeking to prevent the line's closure and removal. The station was demolished in May 2017 to make way for the light rail depot.Light rail depot on way as end arrives for Wickham station Newcastle Herald 10 May 2017Wickham station demolition underway ahead of light rail depot Newcastle Herald 26 May 2017 A new Newcastle Interchange opened to the west of Wickham station on 15 October 2017 as a terminus for the shortened Newcastle railway line and the Newcastle Light Rail.Last train leaves Newcastle station Newcastle Herald 26 December 2014Wickham Transport Interchange Transport for NSW July 2014Revitalisation of Newcastle CBD continues as Wickham interchange gets the green light Transport for NSW 14 November 2014Timetable changes Central Coast & Newcastle Line and Hunter Line Transport for New South Wales 1 October 2017 Design The signal box at Wickham during the 20th century; date taken unknown. The original Wickham railway station, opened in 1936, featured two side brick faced and asphalt- surface platforms, each able to fit four cars of a modern electric multiple unit train. Platform 1, the southern platform, serviced trains heading inbound to Newcastle, while Platform 2, the northern platform, serviced trains heading outbound from the city. In 2007, Platform 1 was extended eastward to accommodate a full eight-car set for Central Coast & Newcastle Line services. The station buildings, located at the center of each platform, have been described by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage as ones of a \\"Federation character\\", unique to Wickham and Civic stations, which were built much later than most other stations in the Hunter region. Inspectors from the Office of Environment and Heritage, evaluating the station in 2009, described the buildings as such The station's original signal box, described as a \\"Type EO\\", was replaced with a \\"Type O\\" design signal box in 1966. Accessible from Station Street to the station's north, and through a metal staircase at the eastern end of Platform 2, the signal box was a two-storey high brick building, with a \\"terracotta tiled hipped roof and aluminium framed windows\\". The lower floor was primarily used for surveillance of the level crossing at Stewart Avenue, using a closed-circuit television link between the box and the level crossing. A precast reinforced concrete footbridge crossed the tracks at the station's eastern end, allowing easy access for commuters between the platforms. The footbridge is relatively modern, having been built in 1992, with access between the platforms in the 56 years previous only existing through the station's entrances on Beresford Street and Station Street, respectively. Services The former Wickham railway station serviced CityRail, and later NSW TrainLink, Central Coast & Newcastle Line services to on Platform 1 and to on Platform 2. Hunter Line services to Newcastle also departed from Platform 1, while services to and departed from Platform 2.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. On 5 January 2015, Hamilton became the interim terminus for NSW TrainLink's Central Coast & Newcastle and Hunter line services following the partial closure of the Newcastle line. It fulfilled this role until Newcastle Interchange opened on 15 October 2017.Wickham Transport Interchange Transport for NSW July 2014Revitalisation of Newcastle CBD continues as Wickham interchange gets the green light Transport for NSW 14 November 2014Tender awarded to design and construct new Wickham interchange Transport for NSW 18 December 2014Revitalising Newcastle: Hamilton Station re-opens today Transport for NSW 5 January 2015Newcastle Interchange Transport for New South Wales History View looking west in 1906 The Main Northern line between Sydney and Newcastle was constructed in two distinct stages and in the earliest years, was worked as two separate railway systems. The line between Sydney (actually the junction at Strathfield) and the Hawkesbury River was opened on 5 April 1887, with the terminus being on the southern bank of the Hawkesbury River. The line between Newcastle and the northern bank of the Hawkesbury River (near present day Wondabyne) was opened in January 1888. The line was completed through between Sydney and Newcastle with the opening of the massive rail bridge over the Hawkesbury River in 1889. Hamilton is located on the Northern line, between Broadmeadow and Newcastle. In 1857, the railway was opened in the Newcastle area when a line was opened from Honeysuckle Point (near present-day Civic Station) to East Maitland. Unfortunately, neither of these locations were near sea ports, one of the main reasons for the establishment of rail transport in the Newcastle area. By 1858, the Newcastle- end had been extended to the sea port and the East Maitland-end had been extended into the town of Maitland. By the 1870s, the Great Northern Railway (GNR) had been extended further up the Hunter Valley and into Murrurundi. Initially, single lines were laid in the area, but by the 1860s, most lines had been duplicated. Hamilton Railway Station was opened in 1872, between Newcastle and Waratah. In January 1888, a line had been constructed from Hamilton, south to the Hawkesbury River. The railway junction between the GNR and the new main line toward the Hawkesbury River was named Hamilton Junction. A signal box was built at Hamilton Junction in 1888, later being replaced by a new elevated brick, standard style signal box in 1898. In 1892, a locomotive depot was built in the triangular area of land formed by the line from Newcastle toward Maitland, the line from Hamilton toward the Hawkesbury River and the line between Waratah and Broadmeadow, which in effect joined the GNR to the line to Sydney. The locomotive depot replaced the first depot in the Newcastle area - Honeysuckle Point. Hamilton locomotive depot was itself replaced by the much larger Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot in 1924. At Hamilton, two side platforms were built, one for the Up main line and one for the Down main line. A goods yard was laid in behind the Down (northern side) platforms. A number of station buildings (in brick) were constructed on each platform. At the Sydney-end of the platforms, Beaumont Street crossed the main lines and part of the goods yard, and a footbridge (parallel to Beaumont Street) spanned the main lines allowing access to the platforms. Pedestrians normally crossed the railway tracks using the Beaumont Street level crossing, but when a train was due in either direction, and the level crossing gates were closed, the same pedestrians could use the station footbridge to cross the tracks. Hamilton Junction signal box (also at the Sydney-end of the platforms and adjacent to the level crossing) controlled the main lines, the level crossing gates and access to the nearby Substation / Electrical and Mechanical depot sidings. Up until 1924, Hamilton Junction signal box also controlled the entry and departure (by locomotives) to Hamilton locomotive depot, situated in the triangle. Between 1890 and the 1970s railway gardens proliferated, with competitions and prizes for the best ones. A Railway Nursery was set up at HOmebush station in Sydney in 1923 and another lsmaller one at Hamilton Station although most plants were sourced from staff's home gardens or donations by residents.Longworth, 2012, 4 Electrification of the main line between Gosford and Newcastle was opened in May 1984, an extension of the Sydney-Gosford electrification which had been completed in 1960. The new electrification project involved new or rebuilt platforms, station buildings, footbridges, overbridges and underbridges, line side buildings, sidings and myriad structures in that section in order to permit the operation of the wider electric passenger rollingstock and electric locomotives. Accordingly, some upgrading was undertaken at Hamilton, and that included total replacement of the original footbridge. Some station buildings on each platform have been upgraded, but the original brick main station buildings on each platform are extant, albeit with some modern features. The goods sidings behind the down main line platform have been removed. The existing Hamilton Junction signal box retains control of the main lines and Beaumont Street level crossing. In 2007, Platform 1 was extended eastwards to accommodate eight carriages and allow Beaumont Street level crossing to remain open while trains are at the station.Newcastle Rail Corridor Upgrade Projects NSW Premier's Office In January 2015, Platform 2 was extended eastwards to accommodate eight carriages. As part of the works to relocate the line's terminus to Newcastle Interchange, stabling sidings are to be laid behind Platform 2 on the site of the former goods yard. Services Hamilton has two side platforms. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Central Coast & Newcastle Line services to and from Sydney Central and Hunter railway line services to and from Maitland, Muswellbrook, Scone, Telarah and Dungog. Hamilton Station is served by a number of bus routes operated by Newcastle Transport.Hamilton station Transport for New South Wales  Description  The heritage-listed station complex includes the station buildings on Platform 1 ( 1875, altered 1898) and Platform 2 (1898), toilet block, store room ( 1898), signal box (1898), platforms ( 1984), level crossing, footbridge (1976) and the station landscaping. ;Context The station is located immediately east of the Beaumont Street level crossing and comprises two platforms (each with a platform building) and modern footbridge. All station buildings have been painted cream in colour. The southern side of the station contains a small garden and commuter carpark, whilst the northern side contains several buildings amongst a large amount of cleared area following the removal of a goods yard. Immediately to the west of the level crossing is the Hamilton Junction Signal Box and Hamilton Depot (see separate listing). Two early twentieth century pubs, one either side of the Beaumont Street crossing, reflect the importance of the Junction as a major working hub. ;Station Building - Platform 1 ( 1875, altered 1898) The station building on Platform 1 is a single storey face brickwork building with gabled corrugated iron roof. The building is thought to be the original 1875 third-class station building, modified in 1898 to its current configuration. The awning is supported on curved cast iron brackets and has been extended to the east where it forms a large sheltered seating area adjacent to the ticket office. The roof form of this enclosed seating area follows the form of the station building. Three brick chimney stacks with corbelled string courses are located at the northern end of the station building. Both ends of the station have retained their original timber scrolled bargeboards and finials which add greatly to the otherwise utilitarian structure. The easternmost wall of the station building (seating area) features a corrugated iron wall. The building is typical of the suburban and regional railway stations constructed during the last decades of the late nineteenth century. As per these buildings all windows are timber framed double hung sash windows. Doors are four panelled generally with glazing in the upper panels. Internally, the walls are painted plaster, and original joinery is generally extant. Floor finishes are generally modern (either tiled or linoleum). Ceilings are modern plasterboard with cornices, although some original boarded ceilings remain. The station masters office features a timber mantelpiece and a blocked fireplace. ;Station Building and Toilet Block - Platform 2 (1898) External: The station building on Platform 2 (Down Platform) is very similar to the building on Platform 1, being of brick construction with a corrugated iron gabled roof, and replaced an earlier building on Platform 2. The roof features bargeboards (not scrolled) and timber finials. There is a central double breasted chimney stack with corbelled brick string course. A small awning (not the whole length of the building) is supported on arching cast iron brackets and features timber valances. All external original joinery is still extant, including double hung sash windows. The eastern end of the building features an attached brick toilet block with gabled roof (slightly lower than the station building), also with bargeboards and finial. The toilet block wall presents three recessed lower bays and six sets of air vents to the platform side, and is entered by an arched brick opening. ;Toilet Block A small brick toilet block exists at the eastern end of Platform 1. The building has a tiled floor and corrugated iron gabled roof, and is likely to be the most recent building to have been constructed on the platforms at Hamilton railway station. ;Store Room ( 1898) A small store room is located at the Newcastle (eastern) end of the Platform 1 building. It is unsure when the structure was built, but it features in a c.1900 photograph of the station. The building is square in plan and is of brick construction with a corrugated iron hipped roof. Access is by a door in the eastern wall, while the northern wall features a small window. A storage box for a wheelchair ramp is attached to the northern wall. ;Signal Box (1898) Hamilton Junction signal box is located adjacent to the main Sydney to Newcastle railway line and Beaumont Street at the Sydney-end of Hamilton railway station. The signal box is a two- storey Type E2 structure. The ground floor is of brick construction and features four six pane arched windows on the northern (railway line) elevation. The southern (Esplanade) elevation is of brick construction to roof height with two timber framed sash windows, while the northern wall is brick to sill height, above which sliding timber-framed six pane glazed windows extend around the perimeter. The gabled roof is corrugated fibre cement sheeting with gables of tongue-and-groove timber horizontal boarding. Original timber barge boards and finials have been removed, as has the original stair and balcony on the eastern (Beaumont Street) elevation which has been replaced with a utilitarian steel structure. A corbelled brick chimney has been removed from the centre of the rear elevation. The building has been painted cream in colour. Internally, Hamilton Junction was built to contain a large mechanical- type lever frame. The ground floor contains interlocking levers and rodding, a separate relay room and signal control wiring. The upper floor (operating level) contains a large mechanical lever frame with 56 large-type signal / point levers, track / signal diagrams, telephones and other equipment necessary for the functioning of an important signal box. Control equipment for the adjacent level crossing gates and warning lights are located at the Newcastle-end of the signal box. Sliding, timber-framed 6 pane glass windows are located in the front (northern) wall and both end walls to assist with natural lighting, although the windows at the north-east corner have been replaced with aluminium framed single panes. A fireplace has been infilled in the centre of the southern wall. The upper floor has a timber floor and timber tongue-and-groove panelling on the walls. The ceiling (originally tongue-and- groove but since covered over) is of plasterboard. ;Platforms ( 1984) Platforms have modern precast concrete faces and asphalt surfaces. The eastern ends of the platforms feature well maintained garden beds with small shrubbery. All furniture, lights and bins are standard late 20th century standard SRA spec. ;Level Crossing The Beaumont Street level crossing is a key feature of the Hamilton Railway Station precinct, and features early twentieth century boom gates imported from the United States in operational condition. The level crossing is operated by the adjacent Signal Box. ;Footbridge (1976) The original steel framed footbridge was replaced in 1976 by a steel beam structure over the main line at the level crossing. The footbridge spans over the land formerly occupied by sidings on the northern side of the Platform 2 building. ;4 Fern Street and Former Sidings and Goods Yard The Newcastle Field Depot for the Transport Asset Holding Entity's Communications & Control Systems is located at No.4 Fern Street, on the northern side of Hamilton railway station (excluded from listing). This large, hip-roofed, brick building is of modern construction and stands on the site formerly occupied by sidings. It was not inspected in early 2009. The area surrounding 4 Fern Street was a former goods yard and siding. Some tracks remain, but mostly this area is unused. There are a number of mature trees in this area and adjacent to 4 Fern Street. ;Moveable Heritage The signal box contains a large number of significant moveable items associated with the operation of the signal box, the majority of which are still in use. Significant items include: a timber- framed telephone with exterior brass bells; a wall clock with State Rail logo; timber wall-mounted box with alarm bell; a row of ten alarm bells above the southern window; a framed signalling diagram of Hamilton Junction dating from Dec 1940; an illuminated signal indicator board; a cantilevered shelf along the northern window above the signalling frame with attached alarm; and a timber framed control for the operation of the level crossing boom gate in the NE corner of the room. ;Landscaping In addition to the landscaping on the platforms, a large number of mature trees are located on the southern side of the eastern end of Platform 1, extending through to Donald Street. The trees include Camphor Laurels, palms and eucalypts, and form a picturesque background to the curving station platforms. Most of this landscaping is not contained within railway land but provides an attractive setting for the station. Hamilton Junction Signal Box Hamilton Junction signal box in November 2011 Hamilton Junction Signal Box is separated from Hamilton station by Beaumont Street level crossing. The Victorian signal box was built in 1897 by McKenzie & Holland, making it one of the oldest surviving mechanical signal boxes in Australia, and also one of the busiest. Originally fitted with a McKenzie & Holland mechanical lever frame, it now has a 56 lever tappet frame designed by Cyril Byles, the British born New South Wales Government Railways signal engineer and manufactured in Sydney in the former NSWGR Interlocking Workshops. Formerly a much busier location, this signal box once had control of multiple lines, sidings and a short branch for the Vacuum Oil Company. After rationalisation in the 1980s and 1990s, the signal box now controls Hamilton Junction, Beaumont Street level crossing and entry to and exit from sidings used for storing track maintenance vehicles.  Heritage listing  Hamilton Railway Station Group has significance at a state level as part of the wider Hamilton and Woodville Junction railway precinct, formerly one of the most important railway junctions in the State. It was established in 1873 before the construction of the Short North and as such has direct associations with operation of the Great Northern Railway, which was one of the first railway lines in Australia. While there was some limited settlement in the area prior to this date, the construction of the railway encouraged the rapid subdivision and development of the township. Hamilton Railway Station is significant as the junction station between the Great Northern Railway and the Short North, and for its association with the former Hamilton locomotive depot between 1892 and 1924. The platform buildings are good examples of highly intact Victorian railway buildings in their original setting which form part of an excellent example of a late 19th century suburban railway junction, with a range of items still intact including signal box, level crossing, sidings, depot and surrounding hotels and shops. The signal box is considered to be historically rare as an excellent example of a historic signalling installation and retains much original fabric, including the signal lever frame, and has been in constant use for over 110 years. Hamilton railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Hamilton Railway Station has historical significance at a state level. Hamilton Railway Station forms a major part of the wider Hamilton railway precinct, formerly one of the most important railway junctions in NSW. It was established in 1873 before the construction of the Short North and as such has direct associations with operation of the Great Northern Railway, which was one of the first railway lines in Australia. While there was some limited settlement in the area prior to this date, the construction of the railway station encouraged rapid subdivision and development of the township. Hamilton railway station has historical significance as the junction station between the Great Northern Railway and the Short North and for its association with the former Hamilton locomotive depot between 1892 and 1924. Hamilton Junction signal box forms an important element of the greater Hamilton railway precinct, controlling the main lines, level crossing gates, and (until 1924) access to the Hamilton locomotive depot. The Hamilton Junction signal box retains much original fabric, including the signal lever frame, and has been in constant use for over 110 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Hamilton Railway Station has aesthetic significance at a state level. The platform buildings are good examples of late nineteenth century railway station buildings. Although the original Platform 1 building underwent early alterations and additions, the two platform buildings remain largely intact with relatively minor exterior alterations and in their original 1898 setting. Hamilton Railway Station forms an important component of a wider railway precinct and the level crossing in particular has a direct relationship with the signal box and adjacent hotels on Beaumont Street. Hamilton Junction signal box has aesthetic significance at a state level. The signal box is a good example of a Type E2 signal box, or what was later to become known as a \\"Standard Signal Box\\". The building has undergone relatively few alterations since its construction and remains in original condition. The building occupies a prominent position not only within the Hamilton railway junction, but also within the wider railway precinct along Beaumont Street that includes the two adjacent railway hotels. The signal box has landmark status within the town, adjacent to the level crossing at the \\"gateway\\" to Hamilton. The signal box has technical significance at a state level as a fully operational example of a late nineteenth century mechanical lever frame signal box, one of very few such signal boxes still in operation in the state. Hamilton Junction signal box contains a relatively large mechanical lever frame (56 levers) and over the past 100 years has exercised control over one of the busiest railway junctions in the state. In the past, Hamilton Junction signal box controlled train operations at the station, the nearby road level crossing, the goods yard, a number of nearby industrial sidings, and between 1892 and 1924, also controlled access to and from Hamilton locomotive depot. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Hamilton Junction signal box has research significance at a local level. The signal box and its frame remains in close to original condition and is a fully operational example of late nineteenth century signalling and railway technology. It is an important reference site for its type. The archaeological research potential of the site is low. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Hamilton Railway Station is considered to be rare within the metropolitan north region as a relatively intact example of a late nineteenth century railway junction. Hamilton Junction signal box, in particular, is considered to be historically rare at a State level. Signal boxes are (or were) exceptionally important installations as far as railway operations are concerned. Safe and reliable handling of passenger and goods trains was paramount and the signal box and its operators were a major part of that task. Over recent years many installations, including railway signal boxes, have been removed and/or replaced by modern technology. Hamilton Junction signal box is an excellent example of a historic signalling installation. The signal box was constructed in 1898 and is a good representative of a style which the New South Wales railways termed as a \\"Standard Signal Box\\". More than 80 of this style were built, but demolitions and removal of many examples means that few examples of this style remain. Hamilton signal box is rare as a fully operational signal box in a prominent suburban context still using the original mechanical lever signal frame. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Hamilton Railway Station, together with the Hamilton signal box and depot, is an excellent representative example of a late nineteenth century suburban railway junction, because it has a high degree of integrity with a range of buildings still intact from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries including station building, level crossings, signal box, sidings, and surrounding hotels and shops. The remnants of the Hamilton depot are also close by. Hamilton Junction signal box is an excellent representative example of a \\"standard\\" type signal box. The signal box is a good example of both late nineteenth century railway architecture and technology, and represents over 100 years of continuous signalling operation at Hamilton Junction.

It is a streptogramin group antibiotic, similar to virginiamycin, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces pristinaespiralis. It is marketed in Europe by Sanofi-Aventis under the trade name Pyostacine. Pristinamycin is a mixture of two components that have a synergistic antibacterial action. Pristinamycin IA is a macrolide, and results in pristinamycin's having a similar spectrum of action to erythromycin. Pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A) is a depsipeptide. PI and PII are coproduced by S. pristinaespiralis in a ratio of 30:70. Each compound binds to the bacterial 50 S ribosomal subunit and inhibits the elongation process of the protein synthesis, thereby exhibiting only a moderate bacteriostatic activity. However, the combination of both substances acts synergistically and leads to a potent bactericidal activity that can reach up to 100 times that of the separate components. The pristinamycin biosynthetic gene cluster is the largest antibiotic supercluster known so far, with a size of ~210 kb, wherein the PI and PII biosynthetic genes are not clustered individually but are scattered across the complete sequence region.Mast Y, Weber T, G√∂lz M, Ort- Winklbauer R, Gondran A, Wohlleben W, Schinko E (2010) Characterization of the ‚Äòpristinamycin supercluster‚Äô of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis. Microbial Biotechnology. Furthermore, this biosynthetic gene region is interrupted by a cryptic type II PKS gene cluster. Clinical use Despite the macrolide component, it is effective against erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and strepcococci. It is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Its usefulness for severe infections, however, may be limited by the lack of an intravenous formulation owing to its poor solubility. Nevertheless, it is sometimes used as an alternative to rifampicin+fusidic acid or linezolid for the treatment of MRSA. The lack of an intravenous formulation led to the development of the pristinamycin-derivative quinupristin/dalfopristin (i.e., Synercid), which may be administered intravenously for more severe MRSA infections.

Nuthatch was laid down at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan on 22 May 1942. She was launched on 16 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Charles D. Swain, and commissioned on 19 November 1942, with Commander D. D. Humphreys in command. Service history =Atlantic Fleet, 1942-1944= Nuthatch crossed the Great Lakes and steamed down the St. Lawrence River into the Atlantic, and proceeded along the east coast for shakedown. Between January 1943 and April 1944, Nuthatch served in the Atlantic Fleet Convoy Escort Group, operating on the \\"Sugar\\" runs. Homeported at Norfolk, Virginia, she operated to and from Santiago, Cuba; Cura√ßao, Netherlands West Indies; Bermuda; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Galveston, Texas; and Port Arthur, Texas; and other small ports in the Caribbean and Gulf area. Convoy organization on these runs consisted of one to three Naval or Merchant Marine cargo vessels and tankers escorted by two or three minesweepers. =Europe, 1944-1945= Nuthatch departed the United States with her division MinDiv 21, on 7 April 1944 and headed east to Falmouth, in Cornwall. There she staged for the much awaited invasion of France, scheduled for early June. The division sailed from Torquay on 5 June 1944, and before it began sweeping operations lost one of its units, . Early on 6 June, the division started sweeping the coast of France in assault and check sweeps to assure safe passage channels for the landing craft. Sweeping continued after D-Day, and on 15 June, in the Baie de la Seine, a mine exploded close aboard Nuthatch on the port side forward. While no personnel injuries were incurred, the force of the explosion damaged the hull, stopped the engines, and made all electric gear inoperative. However, within two hours, she was underway again, and soon pulled out of range of German shore batteries. Repairs completed in England, Nuthatch was soon back on the French side of the Channel. On 25 June as a unit of TF 129, she participated in sweeping operations for the bombardment of Cherbourg. Sweep operations in the area continued until 1 August when, with her entire squadron, COMINRON SEVEN, she headed for Gibraltar and duty with the 8th Fleet. Until 31 May 1945, Nuthatch, with MinDiv 21, swept mines and escorted ships in the western Mediterranean; Marseille, Oran, Naples, Bizerte, Valletta, Palermo, and La Maddalena being only a few of her stops. On 31 May, Nuthatch hoisted her homeward bound pennant and got underway for the United States. =Pacific, 1945-1946= Arriving at Hampton Roads on 15 June, Nuthatch underwent repairs, and on 18 September, sailed for Panama and duty with the Pacific Fleet. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 November only to receive orders to return to the United States for inactivation. Arriving at San Diego, on 31 December, she decommissioned on 3 June 1946, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Nuthatch was redesignated MSF-60 on 7 February 1955 and remained in the Reserve Fleet at San Diego until struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1966. She was sunk as a target for the Pacific Fleet. Nuthatch earned two battle stars during World War II.

Odom, Sr. was an American civil rights leader. He was born in Biscoe, Arkansas, on June 9, 1921 to Dr. Elijah and Ada Odom. His father was born into slavery in 1859 and later became a physician. In 1949, he graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. Thereafter he earned a master's degree in social work from Atlanta University. Odom was best recognized for his 43 years of work for civil rights causes in Akron, Ohio, as well as his positions as the executive director of the Akron Community Service Center and the Urban League. Odom, who was married to Sadie Harvey Odom, had two children, one being Philadelphia journalist Vernon Odom. He died on May 22, 1996. Today, he is best remembered by the Vern Odom Allotment, a suburban- style housing development located off Wooster Avenue (Vernon Odom Boulevard) in Akron. In the early 2000s (decade), an effort was made to commemorate Odom's memory by renaming Wooster Avenue (a main thoroughfare through one of Akron's predominantly African-American neighborhoods) Vernon Odom Boulevard. After this was passed, many local signs were renamed to read \\"V Odom Boulevard,\\" reaping much public conversation and amusement. (see below) From Bob Dyer's column \\"Dyer Streets\\" in the Akron Beacon Journal... \\"Victory for Vern\\" We have lost our Vodom. Unlike losing your mojo, losing your Vodom is a good thing. For those of you just joining us, Akron City Council voted in 2002 to rename Wooster Avenue to honor a legendary local civil rights leader named Vernon Odom. But the bill's sponsor, Marco Sommerville ‚Äî operating on the assumption that everyone who worked for the city was familiar with the man ‚Äî scrawled out a quick Post-It Note to the street department requesting signs for the new V Odom Boulevard. The street department took him literally and created V Odom street signs, then passed along his request, verbatim, to the Ohio Department of Transportation, which is responsible for the big signs on the interstates. Thus, we were Vodomized. The word Vodom entered the local lexicon, turning the honor into a joke. Fortunately, Odom's first name wasn't Sam, Stu or Stan. But still ‚Äî this certainly wasn't what his friends and colleagues had in mind. Now, finally, freeway drivers have been fully introduced to Vernon Odom. Unfortunately, a few signs here and there have retained their Vodomism ‚Äî including one marking the boulevard's exit off of another boulevard named for one of Odom's college classmates ‚Äî Martin Luther King Jr. But perhaps in another six years we can fix those, too.

Biography The son of a chazzan, he began the study of the Talmud at an early age, though not to the neglect of secular studies. On completing the course of the cathedral school at Copenhagen, he took up philosophy, Oriental languages, and theology at the university there, at the same time continuing his studies in Talmud and Jewish science. When the Jews of Denmark were emancipated in 1814, confirmation was made obligatory, and the office of catechist was instituted by the state, Mannheimer being the first incumbent (1816). The first confirmation took place May 1817. In 1821 Mannheimer went to Vienna, where there was then no congregation, the community being divided into two opposing parties. Mannheimer, who was welcomed by both factions, soon succeeded in organizing a congregation, drafting a program and ritual on the traditional basis and harmonizing the views of the two parties. He returned to Copenhagen in December of the same year. Failing in his attempt to secure a new synagogue for Reform services, he accepted a call to the pulpit left vacant by Zunz in Berlin. German services, however, were interdicted in that city; the temple formerly under the ministry of B. Beer was closed, and the royal cabinet order of 26 December 1823, obtained by the Orthodox party, frustrated the attempt to adapt the old ritual to new forms by delivering German sermons in the chief synagogue. Mannheimer therefore left Berlin and took temporary charge of the pulpit of Hamburg, preaching also at Leipzig during the fairs. In 1824 he married Liseke Damier, and in November of the same year he was called to the new synagogue of Vienna. As he could not receive the title of preacher or rabbi, he was inducted, in June, 1825, as \\"Direktor der Wiener K. K. Genehmigten Oeffentlichen Israelitischen Religionsschule\\"; he dedicated the new temple in April, 1826, and officiated there until 1829. Mannheimer's success was due in great measure to his oratorical gifts. His sermons were, for their time, models (Geiger, Einleitung in das Studium der J√ºdischen Theologie, in Nachgelassene Schriften, ii. 31). His German translation of the prayerbook and of the fast-day prayers, and his arrangement of the fast-day liturgy, are of permanent importance for the ritual, the conservative spirit in which this work was undertaken leading to its adoption by many communities. In 1848 Mannheimer was returned by Brody to the Austrian Reichstag, where he delivered two memorable speeches, one on the Jewish tax (5 October 1848) and the other on the abolition of capital punishment (29 January 1849). On his seventieth birthday the city of Vienna conferred honorary citizenship upon him. He devoted the gifts bestowed by the community upon him on that occasion to a foundation for the aid of rabbis, preachers, and teachers, which still bears his name. In 1863, Mannheimer, along with Lazar Horowitz, defended Heinrich Graetz, in Viennese court when Graetz was accused of heresy for an article published by Leopold Kompert in a local journal. Graetz had written that the chapters in Isaiah referring to the Messiah were meant to be interpreted non-literally, and that they referred to a national Messiah instead of a personal one. Isaac Hirsch Weiss published a pamphlet entitled Ne·∫ìa·∏• Yisrael in support of the testimony. See Heinrich Graetz #The Kompert Affair. Works Mannheimer published the following works: Pr√¶dikener Holdte ved det Mosaiske Troes-Samfund's Andagts-√ñvelser i Modersmaalet i Sommerhalvaaret 1819 (Copenhagen, 1819); Gottesdienstliche Vortr√§ge Gehalten im Israelitischen Bethause zu Wien im Monate Tischri 5594 (Vienna, 1834); Gottesdienstliche Vortr√§ge f√ºr die Wochenabschnitte des Jahres, vol. i, Genesis and Exodus (ib. 1835; partly translated into Hebrew by E Kuttner, ib. 1865); a translation of the prayer-book and of the fast-day prayers according to the ritual of the Vienna Temple (1840; frequently reprinted). His polemics and responsa include: Gutachten f√ºr das Gebetbuch des Hamburger Tempels (1841); Gutachten Gegen die Reformpartei in Frankfurt-am- Main in Angelegenheit der Beschneidungsfrage (1843); Einige Worte √ºber Juden und Judenthum (supplement to the Oesterreichische Medicinische Wochenschrift, 1842, No. 34), directed against Professor Rosa's statements in reference to the Jewish Question (1848). Two numbers of his Gottesdienstliche Vortr√§ge appeared posthumously, edited by S. Hammerschlag (Vienna, 1876).

First raised in 1912 as a Militia formation to provide training under the compulsory training scheme, the brigade was later re-raised as part of the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Its existence was short lived, as it was disbanded after about six months, before it could be committed to the fighting on the Western Front. Raised again in 1939 for service during World War II, the brigade was deployed to the Middle East in early 1940 and subsequently saw action in the Western Desert and in Greece in 1941. In 1942, it returned to Australia in response to Japan's entry into the war, and later the brigade played a prominent role in the Kokoda Track campaign and at Buna‚ÄìGona in Papua. Withdrawn to Australia in early 1943, the 16th Brigade was re-organised and received many replacements from disbanding formations, but it was not recommitted to combat operations until late in the war. In 1944‚Äì1945, the brigade was committed to the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign in New Guinea. After the war, the brigade was disbanded in 1946. Today, its name is perpetuated by the 16th Aviation Brigade which was raised on 2 April 2002. History =Pre-war years= In 1912, when Australian introduced the compulsory training scheme, a total of 23 Militia brigades, mostly of four battalions, were planned for. These were assigned to six military districts around Australia. At this time, the 16th Brigade formed part of the 3rd Military District. The brigade's constituent units had training depots in various locations around southern Victoria, including Newmarket, North Melbourne, South Carlton, Collingwood, Fitzroy, East Melbourne and Footscray. The brigade's constituent battalions were sequentially numbered: 61st, 62nd, 63rd and 64th. =World War I= During World War I, the brigade was briefly re- formed as part of the all volunteer First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Following a request from the British to raise another division to complement the five already deployed on the Western Front, the 16th Infantry Brigade was formed in England, on the Salisbury Plain, as part of the 6th Division on 17 March 1917. The brigade was formed mainly from convalescents who were in Britain recovering. The unit did not see any action and was disbanded in September following the Battle of Bullecourt and Battle of Messines due to manpower shortages in the AIF. After this, the brigade's personnel were transferred to the AIF's Overseas Training Brigade with the last elements departing on 19 October 1917. The brigade's machine gun company was later re- designated as the 23rd Machine Gun Company and eventually allocated to the 3rd Machine Gun Battalion, going to serve as part of the 3rd Division. Only 15 infantry brigades were raised as part of the Militia during the interwar years, so the 16th Brigade was not re-raised during this time. =World War II= The 16th Infantry Brigade was reformed on 13 October 1939, again as part of the 6th Division. After its headquarters was opened at Victoria Barracks, in Paddington, New South Wales, the brigade moved to Ingleburn the following month. Consisting of four infantry battalions ‚Äì the 2/1st, 2/2nd, 2/3rd and 2/4th ‚Äì the brigade was the first raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). After rudimentary training, the brigade embarked for the Middle East in January 1940, reaching Julis, in Palestine, the following month. The brigade was reduced to three battalions in May, as the Australian Army was reorganised to replicate the British Army's brigade structure. This saw the 2/4th Battalion being transferred to the 19th Brigade. Training continued during this time until the 16th Brigade moved to Helwan in Egypt, where they received the remainder of their equipment. Divisional exercises took place in October and November, after which the 6th Division was deployed to Libya. Troops from the 2/2nd Battalion attacking Bardia, January 1941 In January 1941, the brigade was committed to the Western Desert Campaign, going into action for the first time around Bardia, which was captured from the Italians over several days. This was followed later in the month by the capture of Tobruk, where the 16th Brigade remained while the 6th Division's other two brigades, the 17th and 19th, took part in other actions around Derna and Benghazi. In March, the division concentrated around Amiriya as they prepared to deploy to Greece, in response to an expected German invasion. During the Battle of Greece, the 16th Brigade occupied Seria before establishing itself in the Veria Pass. As the German attack began, the 2/1st Battalion provided rearguard cover while the brigade withdrew alongside the New Zealand 4th Brigade. A German breakthrough at Tempe Gorge resulted in a further withdrawal during which the 2/2nd and 2/3rd Battalions provided rearguard security as Anzac Corps withdrew through Larissa. After this, the brigade was ordered to evacuate, and elements were withdrawn by sea at Kalamata. The majority of the brigade was evacuated back to Egypt and subsequently re-formed in Palestine; however, elements of the brigade landed on Crete. The 2/1st was landed as a whole and deployed to defend the airfield at Retimo, while elements of the 2/2nd and 2/3rd were formed into a 16th Brigade Composite Battalion. During the fighting, the 2/1st was largely destroyed during the brief Battle of Crete, with the majority being taken prisoner. The 2/1st Battalion was re-raised in June 1941, in Palestine; meanwhile, the 2/3rd Battalion was detached from the brigade to take part in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign, serving with the 17th Brigade. During this time, the 2/6th and 2/7th Battalions briefly came under the brigade's command. Throughout the latter part of 1941, the 16th Brigade undertook garrison duty in Egypt and then later in Syria. In early 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, the Australian government requested that the 6th Division be returned to Australia and in February the brigade moved to Beit Jirja, in Palestine, prior to embarkation. En route, the 16th and 17th Brigades were diverted to Ceylon where they were landed to defend against a possible Japanese invasion. The 16th Brigade defended an area around Horana until July 1942, when they completed the voyage back to Australia, which was completed by August. Troops from the 2/1st Battalion at Wondecla, Queensland, April 1944 A period of leave followed, after which the brigade concentrated at Wallgrove, New South Wales. The following month, as the Japanese continued their advance towards Port Moresby, the 16th Brigade was hastily committed to defend the town. The Japanese advance was subsequently held at Imita Ridge, and as the strategic situation turned against them, they began to withdraw. In October, the 16th Brigade joined the 25th in a pursuit towards Kokoda. Their first action came around Eora Creek, after which the brigade bypassed Kokoda, which was captured by the 25th Brigade, as the Australians turned their advance north towards Wairopi. The brigade's next action came around Oivi‚ÄìGorari. As the majority of the brigade attacked the Japanese around Oivi, the 2/1st Battalion was detached and carried out a flanking manoeuvre with the 25th Brigade to assault the Japanese rear around Gorari. The brigade continued its advance towards the Japanese northern beachheads, coming up against strongly entrenched positions around Sanananda. Heavily depleted by disease and casualties, by December 1942, the 16th Brigade was withdrawn by air back to Port Moresby before returning to Australia in January 1943. The brigade's personnel were granted a period of leave before they reconstituted at Wondecla on the Atherton Tablelands, in Queensland. A long period of training in Australia followed during which time a large batch of reinforcements was received from the 30th Brigade, which was disbanded. During this time, the role of Australian troops in the Pacific declined, as the US took over the main Allied effort. As a result, it was not until the final stages of the war that the 16th Brigade returned to combat operations. In December 1944, the brigade was committed to the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign in New Guinea, when the Australians took over from US forces, which had established a base at Aitape, where they joined the rest of the 6th Division in an advance towards Wewak and then into the Torricelli Range. A series of patrol and small-scale actions followed as the Australians secured the area throughout 1944 and into 1945. Following the conclusion of hostilities in August 1945, the 16th Brigade concentrated around Dallman Harbour. Here, the demobilisation process began shortly afterwards, with drafts of personnel being returned based on priority. Meanwhile, personnel undertook parades and occupation duties, overseeing the surrender of Japanese personnel. In October, elements of the 2/2nd Battalion were sent to Merauke, amidst concerns of an Indonesian uprising. Other activities included vocational education and training, and sports, to keep the troops occupied as they awaited repatriation to Australia.

The tunnel constitutes the easternmost section of the Drammen Line and runs below the central business district of Oslo. It features the four-track Nationaltheatret Station, Norway's second-busiest railway station, where the Oslo Tunnels lies directly beneath the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro. At Frogner, the Elisenberg Station was built, but has never been used. The tunnel is the busiest section of railway line in Norway and serves all west-bound trains from Oslo, including many services of the Oslo Commuter Rail and the Airport Express Train. Traditionally, Oslo had two stations, the larger Oslo East Station (or Oslo √ò, located at the spot of the current Oslo S) and Oslo West Station (Oslo V), which served the Drammen Line. This caused a physical barrier between the two parts of the railway network, only connected by the Oslo Port Line which ran partly in city streets. Formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the Drammen Line to Oslo √ò started in 1938, and the final plans were approved in 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 1 June 1980, and made it possible to close Oslo V in 1989. Nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in 1999, when it was expanded to four tracks, and from 2008 to 2010, the tunnel saw a major technical upgrade. There are plans to build a second tunnel to increase train capacity west of Oslo. Route Class 71 train at Nationaltheatret Station The tunnel constitutes the easternmost of the Drammen Line, and runs between Oslo S and Sk√∏yen. At Oslo S, 12 of the 19 tracks (platforms 1 through 12) connect to the tunnel, which is shaped as a funnel, eventually merging the twelve tracks into two. The tunnel runs below some important heritage buildings in Oslo, including Basarhallene, the Parliament of Norway Building and Oslo Cathedral.Hol√∏s (1990): 182 Nationaltheatret Station is the second-busiest railway station in the country, and is located below the Oslo Metro station with the same name. The station has four tracks and two island platforms, serving the central business district of Oslo.Hol√∏s (1990): 178 Through this section, the line runs below the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro for . At this point, the line is below the surface. Elisenberg Station, located in Frogner, is partially built, including a island platform and one of the entrances. The line follows Bygd√∏y all√© and surfaces just west of Olav Kyrres plass. Immediately afterwards, the Sk√∏yen‚ÄìFilipstad Line merges into the Drammen Line. The next station along the line is Sk√∏yen Station.Hol√∏s (1990): 177 Service The Oslo Tunnel is the most heavily trafficked section of mainline railway in Norway. It has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour in each direction, and an applied capacity of 24 trains per hour in each direction. In rush hour, there are up to 20 trains operating through the tunnel, with a capacity of 8,000 passengers per hour. All eight lines of the Oslo Commuter Rail have some or all of their services operate through the tunnel, although many of these terminate at Sk√∏yen. The Airport Express Train operates four hourly services through the tunnel and the Norwegian State Railways operate regional trains along the Vestfold Line and intercity trains along the S√∏rland Line and Bergen Line through the tunnel. Freight trains along the S√∏rland Line operate through the tunnel, although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen Line do not, instead using the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line. History By the 1930s, Oslo had two main railway stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. The Drammen Line, consisting of commuter trains, and regional and intercity trains from the S√∏rland Line and the Vestfold Line, terminated at Oslo V. The √òstfold, Trunk and Gj√∏vik Lines terminated at Oslo √ò. Between the two stations ran the Oslo Port Line, which in part ran in the city streets and was only used for a limited number of freight trains. Several plans had been launched to connect the two stations, with the most prominent being a line running west of Oslo and merging with the Gj√∏vik Line at Grefsen, and an elevated line from Oslo V to Tordensskiolds plass, in a tunnel under Akershus Fortress and again as an elevated line past Oslo Stock Exchange to Oslo √ò.Hol√∏s (1990): 102‚Äì103 Entrance to Nationaltheatret from Rusel√∏kkveien In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was established to look into a possible connection of the Drammen Line to Oslo √ò and extension of the railway station.Hol√∏s (1990): 103 Led by Axel Grenholm,Hol√∏s (1990): 102 the committee recommended one of two alternatives: either establish a branch from the Drammen Line and built a tunnel under the city center, in which all trains would terminate at Oslo √ò. The tunnel was proposed run from Lassons gate west of Oslo V to Fred. Olsens gate, with an intermediate station close to the location of Oslo V.Hol√∏s (1990): 107 The proposed tunnel would be long and largely run through clay, making construction more difficult and expensive.Hol√∏s (1990): 108 Alternatively, a branch of Drammen Line should be built around the city and connect with the Gj√∏vik Line at Grefsen. Commuter trains would continue to run to Oslo V, while regional and intercity trains would run to Oslo √ò. The committee stated that it preferred the former suggestion. In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, led by Fin Hvoslef, was established by the government.Hol√∏s (1990): 117 In 1950, they presented a new report, which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered to ease construction and increase safety.Hol√∏s (1990): 121 This was in part based on an engineering report from 1949, which had made the first detailed plans for the line. It was a compromise between the Norwegian State Railways' need for a line as straight as possible, and Oslo Municipality's demands that the construction should not be a risk to buildings in the area.Hol√∏s (1990): 123 The ground in Oslo consists of clay-filled grooves up to deep. The area also contains alum shale, which expands when it comes into contact with air and water and can attack concrete,Hol√∏s (1990): 124 argillaceous schist, cracks with clay and water, and hard volcanic rocks.Hol√∏s (1990): 160 Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was established in 1960 to look at the matter again.Hol√∏s (1990): 128 Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station.Hol√∏s (1990): 130 However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Sk√∏yen, and build a second station at Frogner.Hol√∏s (1990): 133 The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments.Hol√∏s (1990): 135 Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.Hol√∏s (1990): 139 Eastbound platform at Nationaltheatret Another planning office was established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle.Hol√∏s (1990): 143 The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968,Hol√∏s (1990): 157 and construction started in 1971.Hol√∏s (1990): 171 The main contractors were Ingeni√∏r Thor Furuholmen, Dipl.ing. Kaare Backer, NSB, Jernbaneanlegget Oslo Sentralstasjon and Ingeni√∏rbygg. Consultants included Ingeni√∏rene Bonde & Co., Peer Qvam's arkitektkontor and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. The tunnel was officially opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications, Ronald Bye,Hol√∏s (1990): 153 and officially taken into use on 1 June.Bjerke (1994): 12 When it opened, it was the eighth-longest railway tunnel in Norway, although since 2005 it has been the thirteenth-longest. The tunnel cost 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK 170 million. At first, the tunnel was used by commuter trains from Lillestr√∏m to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and √Örnes used the tunnel and turned at Sk√∏yen. Oslo Central Station was taken into use on 26 November 1986. On 27 May 1989, Oslo West Station was closed and all traffic transferred to Oslo S.Hol√∏s (1990): 156 In October 1997, construction of an upgraded Nationaltheatret Station started and was taken into use on 16 December 1999. The work expanded the station from two to four platforms, thus increasing the applied capacity for the whole tunnel from 16 to 24 trains per direction per hour. The expansion cost NOK 920 million, which included blasting of rock and pouring of concrete. The work resulted in of new tunnel, a new entrance hall and art. The station was designed for 40,000 passengers daily. In 2008, the old section of Nationaltheatret Station was renovated. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators, a more powerful fire safety system, improved emergency exits and replacement of cables. The upgrade made the old section lighter, as it was previously painted in dark red, and visually similar to the new section. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration is performing a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the Oslo Tunnel. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches, switch heaters at the tunnel openings and new tracks. Future An Airport Express Train leaving the Oslo Tunnel's west end The Oslo Tunnel is the largest bottle-neck in the railway system in Norway, and delays caused around the tunnel can spread throughout the whole network. The local rail lines have only one or two departures per hour, but more are desired in order to attract people who want to find departure times matching work hours. The now defunct National Rail Administration had stated that until 2040 at the earliest, it is unnecessary with more capacity through the West Corridor, i.e. running west of Oslo. This includes possible upgrades to the railway lines around Oslo, such as high-speed lines along the √òstfold and Vestfold Lines, and to Lillehammer. In 2012, after the completion of the Asker Line, a new schedule plan has been proposed. NSB, the Airport Express Train and CargoNet have all asked for more slots through the tunnel than is available. One possible solution is to decrease the reserve capacity, thus increasing the capacity from 24 to 30 trains per hour per direction. However, the tunnel is already characterized as \\"critically overloaded\\". Potential second Oslo Tunnel route Should a new tunnel be built, it would not necessarily run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground, at the location of Oslo Bus Terminal, within walking distance of Oslo S. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane have called for a line to run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where there is a major metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state that it is necessary to build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.

They compete in the and play their home matches at their Wordsworth Drive ground which they moved into during the 1953 season. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. After being formed in 1947, they were admitted into the Western League in 1954. They struggled over the next ten years, and it was not until the 1970s that the club started to prosper. Having won the Western League in 1968‚Äì69, the club then finished as runners-up in the same league in four successive seasons from 1973. They gained promotion to the Southern League in 1977 and purchased their ground from the local council. In the early 1980s they dropped back down into the Western League for financial reasons, but did not enjoy further success until 1989‚Äì90. The following twelve seasons saw the club win the title on four more occasions (1995‚Äì96, 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì01) and finish as runners-up four times (1993‚Äì94, 1996‚Äì97, 1997‚Äì98 and 2001‚Äì02). In 2001 the club won the FA Vase, which it had narrowly missed out on seven years earlier. Following their string of good results, Taunton rejoined the Southern League for the 2002‚Äì03 season. After the latest re-organisation of the English football league system, the club are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South. History In December 1947 a group of businessmen founded Taunton Football Club, and the club played its first match in Easter the following year. The club joined the Somerset Senior League, in which they played until 1953. During this year the club gained admission to the Western League for the first time. In the same year, the club also moved into their present ground on Wordsworth Drive, which they leased from Taunton Borough Council. During these early years of the club they battled financial problems and relied upon their Supporters Club. In 1968‚Äì69, the club enjoyed success for the first time, winning the Western League under the management of Doug Hillard. Over the following years Taunton Town continued to prosper on the pitch, finishing as Western League runners-up in four consecutive seasons from 1973 until 1976. During this time the club bought their Wordsworth Drive ground from the local council and installed floodlights. In 1977 they were promoted into the Southern League (Southern Section). Two years later, following the opening of the M5 motorway, they moved into the Midlands Section of the league. In 1981, the club became a limited company, and the club's board decided that competing in the Southern League was too much of a financial burden; resulting in a drop back into the Western League for the 1983‚Äì84 season. The club finished as league champions for the second time in 1989‚Äì90 and followed this win up with further success, winning the league again in 1995‚Äì96, 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì01. They also finished as runners-up on four occasions; in 1993‚Äì94, 1996‚Äì97, 1997‚Äì98 and 2001‚Äì02. Following their runners-up position in 2001‚Äì02, and the improved financial position of the club compared to twenty years earlier, the club was successful in its application to re-enter the Southern League. The club have remained in this league ever since, and after the restructuring of the English football league system, the club were placed in the Southern Football League Division One South & West. The club reached the final of the FA Vase in 1994, where they lost in extra time to Diss Town. A second FA Vase finals appearance in 2001 resulted in greater success, Taunton Town beating Berkhamsted Town 2‚Äì1. In 2016‚Äì17 they reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for only the second time in their history, where they faced Barrow and held them to a 2‚Äì2 draw but were beaten away in the replay 2‚Äì1. In 2017‚Äì18, Taunton celebrated promotion from the Southern League South & West for the first time in their history, clinching the title after a home 3‚Äì2 win over Kidlington. In 2018-19 Taunton narrowly missed out on promotion to the National League South after losing to Poole Town on penalties at the Viridor Stadium during their Southern League Premier playoff game. <https://tauntontown.com/event/taunton-v-poole/ On 20 November 2019, Taunton Town equaled the record for the longest penalty shoot out in English footballing history beating Truro City 12-11 after 34 penalties in the Southern League challenge cup. Goalkeeper Lloyd Irish scored one and missed another whilst also saving three penalties with Truro missing the target another 3 times before Jack Rice finally scored the winning penalty after 34 minutes of drama.

When they came back to the US, they were often asked why some people from around the world disagreed with American values. These students set up AID to bring the world home to Americans, and to launch student dialogue and action about what the US role in the world should look like.http://www.utne.com/2008-11-01/Politics/Utne- Reader-Visionaries-Special-Project-An-Interview-with-Lawrence-Lessig.aspx Work AIDemocracy's strategy has three pillars: *Education: AIDemocracy helps students understand key issues in environment, development, peace and security, and health, as well as the global system that frames these issues. Specific tactics include: creating an annual Network Platform and Report Card, issue training (issue briefs, coaching, webinars, toolkits, videoconferences, film screenings, speaker tours, etc.), and issue monitoring (blogs, new media and student Issue Analysts). *Cultivation: AIDemocracy builds student leaders and organizers who understand not only the issues, but also their own power, how to organize others, and how to access decision-makers. Specific tactics include: advocacy, organizing and leadership trainings, and building a community of student leaders (regional and annual summits, participation in meetings and parallel events, network ‚Äúweaving‚Äù). *Mobilization: AIDemocracy creates and connects students to opportunities to take action, from the campus to the national level. In addition to promoting opportunities to take action through AIDemocracy and partner campaigns, they also support student campaigns on these issues. Tactics include: policymaker education and lobby visits, using the media (op-eds, LTEs, etc.), blogs, new media (Facebook, video, etc.), days of action, strategic coaching, etc. The organization has worked hard to engage diverse constituencies in its mission and programming, including students from the Citadel to UC Berkeley and celebrities from Seinfeld actor Jason Alexander to Pakistani rock star Salman Ahmad. AID's work has been mentioned in more than 500 media outlets from sources that cover politics and global affairs such as The New York Times, C-SPAN, CNN, and The Washington Post to more unexpected sources such as Marie Claire and the Montel Williams Show.

History Willenhall Town was formed in 1953 by the amalgamation of two local sides, Aston Road Villa and R.A.F. Association. The club played in the Wolverhampton League from their formation until 1968, when they joined the Staffordshire County League (South). In 1975 they joined the West Midlands (Regional) League. They quickly won promotion to the Premier Division and then claimed the Premier Division title in 1979, pipping Lye Town to the title on goal difference. In 1981 they reached the FA Vase final at Wembley Stadium but lost to Whickham, and a year later gained promotion into the Southern Football League Midland Division. In the 1983‚Äì84 season the Reds won the title, scoring 100 goals in the process, and gained promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. Although they finished 4th in the Premier Division in their first season, after that their performances declined until they were relegated back to the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1991. In 1994, however, the club became founder members of the new Midland Football Alliance where they were consistent mid-table finishers until the 2003‚Äì04 season when an impressive late season run saw them finish second and gain promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One. The club's former home ground, Noose Lane In their very first season in the Northern Premier League the Reds made it into the promotion play-offs but were defeated. At the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, Willenhall were switched to the Southern League Division One West, and in 2006 they were moved once again to the newly re-organised Division One Midlands. In 2006 manager Rob Smith and assistant manager Larry Chambers left the club for the position of managing AFC Telford United. Mel Eves was appointed as the new manager of Willenhall shortly afterwards. At the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season Willenhall went to the play-off final to face Bromsgrove Rovers. While the game ended 1‚Äì1 after ninety minutes, extra time saw Bromsgrove score an extra goal and gain promotion. In November 2007, Eves left the club and the first team managing duties fell to Dean Edwards for the remainder of the season. With two games remaining in the 2007‚Äì08 season, however, Edwards also parted company with the Lockmen and chairman Paul Garner and Tony Smith took charge for the last two games, winning both, against Barton Rovers and Woodford United. In May 2008 Garner announced the appointment of Shaun Cunnington as manager. Cunnington previously managed Alvechurch in the Midland Football Alliance and when he moved to the Lockmen he was joined by his assistant manager Paul Tomlinson and later by former Coventry City goalkeeper Tim Clarke as goalkeeping coach. In May 2009 the club underwent a period of financial unrest when it was announced the club was selling its ground to Sporting Khalsa. However later that month the club announced that chairman Paul Garner was leaving the club. In November 2009, Shaun Cunnington and assistant manager, Paul Tomlinson left the club. The committee then appointed Steve Pomroy and Micky Rawlings as their replacements. During an uncertain period at the club, relegation to the Midland Football Alliance was confirmed for the 2010‚Äì11 season.Managerial Change at Willenhall After finishing bottom of the Midland Football Alliance in the 2011‚Äì12 season, Willenhall Town became fan-run and were relegated to the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division. They finished in 20th place for 2012‚Äì13 season and played their last match at Noose Lane against Bromyard Town on 7 May 2013, moving to Long Lane Park, Long Lane, Essington for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Willenhall appointed Joe Ball as player-manager for the start of the 2017‚Äì18 season and after a 15 game winning streak and 17 league goals to his name, was subsequently replaced by Mark Cox.

The I Ching (Y√¨ Jƒ´ng), or Classic of Changes, which dates from over 3,000 years ago, is believed to be one of the world's oldest books. The two major branches of Chinese philosophy, Confucianism and Taoism have common roots in the I Ching. A diagram of I Ching hexagrams sent to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz from Joachim Bouvet. The Hindu numerals were added by Leibniz.Perkins, Franklin. Leibniz and China: A Commerce of Light. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p 117. Print. Significance for Chinese culture From its mythological origins in prehistory (see Fu Xi) and the earliest dates of recorded history in China, the I Ching has been added to by a succession of philosophers, scholars and rulers. Thus, it reflects a thread of thinking and a common cosmology that have been passed through successive generations. In addition to the I Ching's broadly recognized influence on Confucianism and Taoism, it has been shown to have influenced Chinese Buddhism. Fazang, patriarch of the Huayan school, is believed to have drawn on a mode of thought derived from the I Ching. One of the earliest versions of the I Ching (called, Zhou I, or Changes of Zhou) was the oracle of the Zhou. It played a role in their overthrow of the Shang dynasty by Zhou King Wu in 1070 BCE. An account of Wu's conquest tells of a solar eclipse believed by the King to be an omen from Heaven to march against the Shang. This account has been matched with a solar eclipse that occurred on June 20, 1070 BCE. Thus, the earliest layer of the I Ching has been shown to preserve a hidden history that went undetected for three millennia. The Zhou Yi has been called one of the most important sources of Chinese culture. It has influenced fields as varied as mathematics, science, medicine, martial arts, philosophy, history, literature, art, ethics, military affairs and religion. Joseph Campbell describes the I Ching as \\"an encyclopedia of oracles, based on a mythic view of the universe that is fundamental to all Chinese thought.\\" =Confucius= Confucius was fascinated by the I Ching and kept a copy in the form of \\"a set of bamboo tablets fastened by a leather thong, [which] was consulted so often that the binding had to be replaced three times. [Confucius] said that if he had fifty years to spare, he would devote them to the I Ching.\\" The ten commentaries of Confucius, (or Ten Wings), transformed the I Ching from a divination text into a \\"philosophical masterpiece\\". It has influenced Confucians and other philosophers and scientists ever since. Influence on Japan Prior to the Tokugawa period (1603‚Äì1868 CE) in Japan, the Book of Changes was little known and used mostly for divination until Buddhist monks popularized the Chinese classic for its philosophical, cultural and political merits in other literate groups such as the samurai. The Hagakure, a collection of commentaries on the Way of the Warrior, cautions against mistaking it for a work of divination. Influence on Western culture Michael Nylan notes the considerable influence of the I Ching on intellectuals in Europe and America. It is the most familiar of the five Chinese classics, and without doubt, the best-known Chinese book. * German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was keenly interested in the I Ching, and translated I-Ching binary system into modern binary system. * Author Douglas Adams's The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul features an I Ching pocket calculator that represents anything greater than four as \\"A Suffusion of Yellow\\". * British poet Alan Baker based his prose- poem sequence \\"The Book of Random Access\\" (pub. 2011) on the 64 Hexagrams of the I Ching. * When Danish Physicist Niels Bohr was awarded Denmark's highest honor and the opportunity to create a family coat of arms, he chose the yin- yang symbol, and Latin motto contraria sunt complementa, \\"opposites are complementary\\", a nod to his Principle of Complementarity. * The philosopher and novelist Will Buckingham has used the I Ching extensively, describing it as an 'uncertainty machine'. * Musician and composer John Cage used the I Ching to decide the arrangements of many of his compositions. * Composer Andrew Culver and choreographer Merce Cunningham use the I Ching. * The ABC soap opera Dark Shadows featured yarrow sticks and a copy of the I Ching that allowed characters meditating on the hexagrams to astral travel. * The hip-hop music group Dead Prez refer to the I Ching in several of their songs and in their logo. * The D&B-metal; music group Marshall Ar.ts use the I Ching hexagram 36 in their logo and refers to it in several songs. * Author Philip K. Dick used the I Ching when writing The Man in the High Castle and including it in the story as a theme. * In a 1965 interview, Bob Dylan stated that the book is \\"the only thing that is amazingly true, period‚Ä¶besides being a great book to believe in, it‚Äôs also very fantastic poetry\\" and in a mid-1970s rendition of his song Idiot Wind he sang \\"I threw the I-Ching yesterday, it said there might be some thunder at the well.\\" * The film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra uses a red hexagram tattoo on the right forearm for the Storm Shadow ninja clan. * The poet Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem called Consulting I Ching Smoking Pot Listening to the Fugs Sing Blak in 1966. * Musician George Harrison, who composed the Beatles song While My Guitar Gently Weeps, recalls he \\"picked up a book at random, [the I Ching] opened it, saw \\"gently weeps\\", then laid the book down again and started the song\\". * Author Hermann Hesse's 1943 novel The Glass Bead Game is mainly concerned with the principles of the I Ching. * Psychologist Carl Jung wrote a foreword to the Wilhelm‚ÄìBaynes translation of the I Ching. * The TV series Lost featured the ba gua as in the logo for The Dharma Initiative. * Author Terence McKenna's Novelty Theory and Timewave Zero, were inspired by analysis of the King Wen sequence. * In director Michael Mann's film Collateral, Vincent (Tom Cruise) refers to I Ching as he tries to teach Max (Jamie Foxx) the importance of improvisation. * Photek released a song called Book of Changes in 1994. * The song Chapter 24 from Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, written by Syd Barrett, features lyrics adapted from the I Ching. * British author Philip Pullman's book The Amber Spyglass features the I Ching amongst the divination methods used by Dr. Mary Malone to communicate with Dust. * The writer Raymond Queneau had a long-standing fascination with the I Ching. * I Ching is mentioned in the Monty Python song I Like Chinese, written by Eric Idle. * Francophone author Ezechiel Saad and his book Yi King, mythe et histoire delves into the shamanic roots of oracular Chinese thought, and examines the real or legendary bestiary, searching for meaning from psychoanalysis and Western culture. * Author Neal Stephenson's novel Quicksilver, uses hexagrams for encryption keys that allow Eliza to send messages to \\"Leibniz\\" from the court of King Louis XIV. * In the late 1960s, the comic book Wonder Woman temporarily changed the title character from a superhero to a secret agent, and placed her under the guidance of an elderly mentor known as \\"I Ching\\". * The I Ching is mentioned in Charmed S5E22 'Oh My Goddess (Part 1)'.

Biscocho is most strongly associated with the versions from the province of Iloilo, although it actually exists nationwide in various forms. It is also known as biscocho duro, machacao, or matsakaw. History Biscocho principe The term biscocho is derived from Spanish bizcocho. However, they are not the same pastries. The original Spanish bizcocho refers to a type of sponge cake known as broas in the Philippines. The crunchy twice-baked and sugar-coated Philippine biscocho (more properly biscocho duro), does not exist in Spanish cuisine. There are multiple claims of people who \\"invented\\" the biscocho in the Philippines, usually varying depending on the region. Variants There are several types of biscochos from various parts of the Philippines. All of them are usually referred to as \\"biscocho\\" colloquially, which can be confusing. A common characteristic of biscocho is that they are typically stale bread that are baked a second time. They include: =Biscocho de ca√±a= Biscocho de ca√±a is the most well-known variant of biscocho. It is a specialty of the Western Visayas islands, particularly the province of Iloilo. They are pieces of stale bread with a small amount of sugar (and no butter) that is then baked to achieve a crunchy texture. The breads used can range from flat sliced breads to sliced pieces of pan de monja (monay). =Biscocho de Manila= Biscocho de Manila Biscocho de Manila originates from Manila. It is characteristically small and round and dusted with white sugar. =Biscocho de rosca= Biscocho de rosca, more commonly known as rosca, is technically a cookie, and not a type of biscocho. It is from the towns of Barugo and Carigara of the island of Leyte. It is made with lard, anise, flour, sugar, butter, and eggs. =Biscocho de sebo= Biscocho de sebo, also known as corbata de sebo, is a bow tie-shaped biscocho from Malolos, Bulacan. It is characteristically made with lard and thus has an oily texture. It is only minimally sweetened. =Biscocho principe= Biscocho principe Biscocho principe, also spelled biscocho prinsipe, is another type of biscocho from Iloilo. It is similar to biscocho de ca√±a but uses butter and more sugar. It can use any type of bread, but usually uses slices of stale ensaymada, as it is already slathered in butter. =Garlic biscocho= Garlic biscocho is a variant of biscocho principe that is topped with butter and garlic (instead of sugar). =Kinihad= Kinihad literally means \\"sliced\\", from Hiligaynon (\\"to slice\\"). It refers to plain thinly sliced bread (without butter or sugar) that is baked to a crunchy texture. It originates from the Ilonggo regions of the Western Visayas. =Pasuquin biscocho= Pasuiquin biscocho is named after the town of Pasuquin in Ilocos Norte from where it originates. Pasuiquin biscocho is shaped like small rolls. It comes in soft and crunchy versions. It does not use butter or sugar, instead it is flavored with anise or anise liqueur, giving it a tangy and slightly salty taste.

Kimba was born in 1926 in Katanga Province, Belgian Congo. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the Essor du Congo. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring Kasa√Ø region founded the Conf√©d√©ration des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter Moise Tshombe declared the secession of the State of Katanga. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga. Tshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the Association G√©n√©rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a government of national unity and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve rapprochement between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a vote of confidence from Parliament, though Kasa- Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief Joseph- D√©sir√© Mobutu launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason. Early life √âvariste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, Bukama Territory, Katanga Province, Belgian Congo. Ethnically, he was a member of Luba tribe. His father was a railway worker. He spent much of his youth in √âlisabethville, where he attended Roman Catholic schools. After receiving a basic primary and middle education Kimba, like his father, worked on the railroad, but continued his studies, taking night classes at St. Boniface Institute in sociology, law, and political economy. He also played on the school's football team. Kimba took up journalism in 1954 when he began writing for the Essor du Congo in √âlisabethville, a conservative, pro-colonial newspaper which covered Katangese affairs. Later that year he became the publication's editor-in-chief, and held the position until 1960. In 1960 he acted as vice president of the Association of the Congolese Press. He married a woman, Bernadette, and had four children with her. In 1958 Kimba attended Expo 58 in Belgium. The following year he traveled abroad, visiting West Germany, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Senegal, the United States, Canada, France, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Ivory Coast, French Cameroon, French Congo, Chad, and French Madagascar. Political career = Early activities = In February 1957 Kimba and a group of other young Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring Kasa√Ø region met to discuss the political future of Katanga. In 1958 they founded the Conf√©d√©ration des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In the spring of 1960 Walter Ganshof van der Meersch was appointed the Belgian Minister of African Affairs and sent to the Congo to oversee its transition to independence. Ganshof made Kimba his assistant chief of staff. On 12 June the Provincial Assembly of Katanga elected him to the Senate on a non-customary CONAKAT list. On 16 June the Katangese provincial government was formed and Kimba was appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry. The Republic of the Congo became independent on 30 June. =Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Katanga= On 11 July 1960 Katangese Provincial President Moise Tshombe declared the secession of the \\"State of Katanga\\". This was opposed by the regional Luba-dominated party, the Association G√©n√©rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT), but Kimba allied himself with Tshombe and maintained that the Katangese Baluba belonged to the Katangese \\"nation\\". Tshombe made Kimba Katanga's Minister of Foreign Affairs. In December he accompanied Tshombe to a conference with leaders of the national Congolese government in Brazzaville to discuss political reconciliation. The talks dissolved without any tangible progress being achieved. Though the role of the full Katangese government diminished over time under Tshombe's leadership, Kimba still actively met with Tshombe and held press conferences. In April 1961 Kimba and Tshombe went to Coquilhatville for further talks with the central government on political reconciliation and revising the Congolese constitution. Unhappy with the conference, Tshombe attempted to leave on 26 April, but he and Kimba were arrested and imprisoned for six weeks. They were released on 22 June and allowed to return to Katanga. In exchange for their liberation, the two men signed an agreement with the Congolese government declaring that representatives from Katangese constituencies would appear in the next session of Parliament. They later repudiated the agreement. In March and May 1962 the Katangese government held further talks with the central government in L√©opoldville, the Congolese capital. While Tshombe was gone, Kimba went on a tour of Luba areas in Katanga to rally their favour in support of the secession. On 18 May the last round of the L√©opoldville negotiations was due to take place, but Tshombe, stalling for time, stayed in Katanga and sent Kimba in his place. Under military pressure from the United Nations Operation in the Congo, Tshombe declared the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963; on 19 January he received UN officials at his residence and, in the presence of Kimba and some of his other ministers, declared that he would accept the UN's terms for Katanga's reintegration into the Congo. = Break from Tshombe = In the aftermath of the secession, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe; Kimba preferred reconciliation with the central government, but Tshombe did not wish it at the time. Tshombe went to Paris, while in February 1963 Kimba became Minister of Education of the new province of South Katanga. From April until August he served as the province's Minister of Economic Affairs and Minister of Information. In June he went to L√©opoldville, to reach an understanding with the central government. In September he attended a conference of moderate political parties in Luluabourg as an observer. On 18 September Kimba went to Europe for \\"health reasons\\". He returned to the Congo in January 1964. On 13 December he was elected president of the central committee of the Entente Muluba, an √âlisabethville-based organisation. That year Tshombe was welcomed back into the country and made Prime Minister at the helm of a transitional government tasked with suppressing a leftist insurrection in the eastern Congo. After this was largely accomplished, general elections took place in 1965 and Tshombe's new coalition organisation, the Convention Nationale Congolaise (CONACO) won a majority of the seats in Parliament. Kimba also contested in the election for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, and won on a BALUBAKAT list. Afterwards he took a brief trip to Paris. Shortly before Parliament was due to reopen, the strength of CONACO faltered, and an anti-Tshombe coalition, the Front Democratique Congolais (FDC), was formed. Kimba joined it in October. = Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo = Kimba was overthrown in a coup launched by Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu (pictured) in November 1965 In the months following the elections, the political rivalry between Tshombe and the President of the Congo, Joseph Kasa-Vubu, grew increasingly tense. At the first session of the new Parliament on 13 October 1965, Kasa-Vubu unexpectedly announced that Tshombe's transitional government had fulfilled its purpose. He named Kimba the new Prime Minister and tasked him with forming a government of national unity. Kimba had little personal following or national reputation and thus was considered inoffensive to members of Parliament and of little threat to Kasa- Vubu's ambitions. Kasa-Vubu also hoped that by appointing another Katangese to the post, he would avoid aggravating persisting secessionist sentiment in Katanga. Kimba's government was installed on 18 October, representing 16 of the 39 political parties with members in Parliament. Kimba's government was more nationalistic than Tshombe's administration and aimed to curb Western influence in Congolese affairs; it was markedly less amicable towards Belgian interests. The new cabinet sought to improve the Congo's relations with active countries in the Organisation of African Unity including Ethiopia and Ghana, and to distance itself from the members of the African and Malagasy Common Organisation. The government opened negotiations with Congo-Brazzaville, and on 5 November Kimba announced that in its first step towards rehabilitating the Congo's ties with African states his government was renewing ferry traffic across the Congo river between Brazzaville and L√©opoldville, which had been suspended for two years. The following day he formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Congo-Brazzaville. He also reopened the Congo-Uganda border, which had been closed since February. Kimba revised the composition of his government on 8 November. Tshombe's removal from power angered his supporters, and in the following weeks they competed with anti-Tshombe partisans for dominance in Parliament. On 14 November the Kimba Government was presented to the legislature for a formal vote of confidence. It was defeated, 72 to 76 in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 to 58 in the Senate. The next day Kasa-Vubu renominated Kimba as Prime Minister, resulting in a political deadlock. On 25 November, Army Commander-in-Chief Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu, who had previously supported Kimba, launched a coup removing both him and Kasa- Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. Colonel L√©onard Mulamba was appointed to replace Kimba. Arrest and death In May 1966 Kimba and former government ministers J√©r√¥me Anany, Emmanuel Bamba, and Alexandre Mahamba were arrested by Mobutu's security forces while attending a meeting with military officials. They were taken to a military camp and tortured. Mobutu's regime accused them of plotting to assassinate Mobutu and Prime Minister Mulamba and overthrow the government. On 30 May the four men were tried before a military tribunal. The trial lasted an hour and a half and the accused were allowed no legal counsel. They pleaded innocence, claiming that they had been working at the behest of officers in the army. After deliberating for seven minutes, the three military judges found the four men guilty of treason and sentenced them to death. This was in violation of standing Congolese law, which did not consider plotting a coup to be a capital crime. On 2 June 1966, Kimba and the other men were publicly hanged in L√©opoldville before a large crowd. Kimba was the first of the four to be executed. His family never received his body. Kimba was the second former Prime Minister of the Congo to be killed after Patrice Lumumba. Some time after Kimba's death, the Avenue des Chutes in Lubumbashi (formerly √âlisabethville) was officially renamed in his honour, though the street is still usually referred to by its original name. In 2011 a congress of the \\"Luba People\\" declared that Kimba was among \\"our valiant martyrs\\".

Definition Let (X, Œ£, Œº) be a measure space and B a Banach space. The Bochner integral is defined in much the same way as the Lebesgue integral. First, a simple function is any finite sum of the form :s(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\chi_{E_i}(x) b_i where the Ei are disjoint members of the œÉ-algebra Œ£, the bi are distinct elements of B, and œáE is the characteristic function of E. If Œº(Ei) is finite whenever bi ‚â† 0, then the simple function is integrable, and the integral is then defined by :\\\\int_X \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\chi_{E_i}(x) b_i\\\\right]\\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mu(E_i) b_i exactly as it is for the ordinary Lebesgue integral. A measurable function ∆í : X ‚Üí B is Bochner integrable if there exists a sequence of integrable simple functions sn such that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_X \\\\f-s_n\\\\_B\\\\,d\\\\mu = 0, where the integral on the left-hand side is an ordinary Lebesgue integral. In this case, the Bochner integral is defined by :\\\\int_X f\\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_X s_n\\\\, d\\\\mu. It can be shown that a function is Bochner integrable if and only if it lies in the Bochner space L^1. Properties Many of the familiar properties of the Lebesgue integral continue to hold for the Bochner integral. Particularly useful is Bochner's criterion for integrability, which states that if (X, Œ£, Œº) is a measure space, then a Bochner-measurable function ∆í : X ‚Üí B is Bochner integrable if and only if :\\\\int_X \\\\f\\\\_B\\\\, d\\\\mu < \\\\infty. A function ∆í : X ‚Üí B is called Bochner- measurable if it is equal Œº-almost everywhere to a function g taking values in a separable subspace B0 of B, and such that the inverse image g‚àí1(U) of every open set U in B belongs to Œ£. Equivalently, ∆í is limit Œº-almost everywhere of a sequence of simple functions. If T is a continuous linear operator, and f is Bochner-integrable, then T f is Bochner-integrable and integration and T may be interchanged: : \\\\int_X T f d\\\\mu = T \\\\int_X f d\\\\mu. This also holds for closed operators, given that T f be itself integrable (which, via the criterion mentioned above is trivially true for bounded T). A version of the dominated convergence theorem also holds for the Bochner integral. Specifically, if ∆ín : X ‚Üí B is a sequence of measurable functions on a complete measure space tending almost everywhere to a limit function ∆í, and if :\\\\f_n(x)\\\\_B\\\\le g(x) for almost every x ‚àà X, and g ‚àà L1(Œº), then :\\\\int_X \\\\f-f_n\\\\_B\\\\,d\\\\mu \\\\to 0 as n ‚Üí ‚àû and :\\\\int_E f_n\\\\,d\\\\mu \\\\to \\\\int_E f\\\\,d\\\\mu for all E ‚àà Œ£. If ∆í is Bochner integrable, then the inequality :\\\\left\\\\\\\\int_Ef\\\\,d\\\\mu\\\\right\\\\_B \\\\le \\\\int_E \\\\f\\\\_B\\\\,d\\\\mu holds for all E ‚àà Œ£. In particular, the set function :E\\\\mapsto \\\\int_E f\\\\, d\\\\mu defines a countably- additive B-valued vector measure on X which is absolutely continuous with respect to Œº. Radon‚ÄìNikodym property An important fact about the Bochner integral is that the Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem fails to hold in general. This results in an important property of Banach spaces known as the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property. Specifically, if Œº is a measure on (X, Œ£), then B has the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property with respect to Œº if, for every countably-additive vector measure \\\\gamma on (X, Œ£) with values in B which has bounded variation and is absolutely continuous with respect to Œº, there is a Œº-integrable function g : X ‚Üí B such that :\\\\gamma(E) = \\\\int_E g\\\\, d\\\\mu for every measurable set E ‚àà Œ£. The Banach space B has the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property if B has the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property with respect to every finite measure. It is known that the space l_1 has the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property, but c_0 and the spaces L^{\\\\infty}(\\\\Omega), L^{1}(\\\\Omega), for \\\\Omega an open bounded subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and C(K), for K an infinite compact space, do not. Spaces with Radon‚ÄìNikodym property include separable dual spaces (this is the Dunford‚ÄìPettis theorem) and reflexive spaces, which include, in particular, Hilbert spaces.

In terms of the standard unit vectors i, j, k of Cartesian 3-space, these specific types of vector-valued functions are given by expressions such as *\\\\mathbf{r}(t)=f(t)\\\\mathbf{i}+g(t)\\\\mathbf{j}+h(t)\\\\mathbf{k} where f(t), g(t) and h(t) are the coordinate functions of the parameter t, and the domain of this vector-valued function is the intersection of the domain of the functions f, g, and h. It can also be referred to in a different notation: *\\\\mathbf{r}(t)=\\\\langle f(t), g(t), h(t)\\\\rangle The vector r(t) has its tail at the origin and its head at the coordinates evaluated by the function. The vector shown in the graph to the right is the evaluation of the function \\\\langle 2\\\\cos t,\\\\, 4\\\\sin t,\\\\, t\\\\rangle near t=19.5 (between 6œÄ and 6.5œÄ; i.e., somewhat more than 3 rotations). The helix is the path traced by the tip of the vector as t increases from zero through 8œÄ. In 2D, We can analogously speak about vector-valued functions as *\\\\mathbf{r}(t)=f(t)\\\\mathbf{i}+g(t)\\\\mathbf{j} or *\\\\mathbf{r}(t)=\\\\langle f(t), g(t)\\\\rangle Linear case In the linear case the function can be expressed in terms of matrices: :y=Ax+b, where y is an n √ó 1 output vector (n > 1), x is a k √ó 1 vector of inputs (k ‚â• 1), A is an n √ó k matrix of parameters, and b is an n √ó 1 vector of parameters. The linear case arises often, for example in multiple regression, where for instance the n √ó 1 vector \\\\hat{y} of predicted values of a dependent variable is expressed linearly in terms of a k √ó 1 vector \\\\hat{\\\\beta} (k < n) of estimated values of model parameters: :\\\\hat{y}=X\\\\hat{\\\\beta}, in which X (playing the role of A in the previous generic form) is an n √ó k matrix of fixed (empirically based) numbers. Parametric representation of a surface A surface is a 2-dimensional set of points embedded in 3-dimensional space. One way to represent a surface is with parametric equations, in which two parameters s and t determine the three Cartesian coordinates of any point on the surface: :(x,y,z)=(f(s,t),g(s,t),h(s,t)) \\\\equiv F(s,t). Here F is a vector-valued function. Derivative of a three-dimensional vector function Many vector- valued functions, like scalar-valued functions, can be differentiated by simply differentiating the components in the Cartesian coordinate system. Thus, if :\\\\mathbf{r}(t) = f(t)\\\\mathbf{i} + g(t)\\\\mathbf{j} + h(t)\\\\mathbf{k} is a vector-valued function, then :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{r}(t)}{dt} = f'(t)\\\\mathbf{i} + g'(t)\\\\mathbf{j} + h'(t)\\\\mathbf{k}. The vector derivative admits the following physical interpretation: if r(t) represents the position of a particle, then the derivative is the velocity of the particle :\\\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{r}(t)}{dt} . Likewise, the derivative of the velocity is the acceleration :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{v}(t)}{d t}=\\\\mathbf{a}(t). =Partial derivative= The partial derivative of a vector function a with respect to a scalar variable q is defined as :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{a}}{\\\\partial q} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\frac{\\\\partial a_i}{\\\\partial q}\\\\mathbf{e}_i where ai is the scalar component of a in the direction of ei. It is also called the direction cosine of a and ei or their dot product. The vectors e1,e2,e3 form an orthonormal basis fixed in the reference frame in which the derivative is being taken. =Ordinary derivative= If a is regarded as a vector function of a single scalar variable, such as time t, then the equation above reduces to the first ordinary time derivative of a with respect to t, :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{a}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\frac{da_i}{dt}\\\\mathbf{e}_i. =Total derivative= If the vector a is a function of a number n of scalar variables qr (r = 1,...,n), and each qr is only a function of time t, then the ordinary derivative of a with respect to t can be expressed, in a form known as the total derivative, as :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf a}{dt} = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{n}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf a}{\\\\partial q_r} \\\\frac{dq_r}{dt} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf a}{\\\\partial t}. Some authors prefer to use capital D to indicate the total derivative operator, as in D/Dt. The total derivative differs from the partial time derivative in that the total derivative accounts for changes in a due to the time variance of the variables qr. =Reference frames= Whereas for scalar- valued functions there is only a single possible reference frame, to take the derivative of a vector-valued function requires the choice of a reference frame (at least when a fixed Cartesian coordinate system is not implied as such). Once a reference frame has been chosen, the derivative of a vector- valued function can be computed using techniques similar to those for computing derivatives of scalar-valued functions. A different choice of reference frame will, in general, produce a different derivative function. The derivative functions in different reference frames have a specific kinematical relationship. =Derivative of a vector function with nonfixed bases= The above formulas for the derivative of a vector function rely on the assumption that the basis vectors e1,e2,e3 are constant, that is, fixed in the reference frame in which the derivative of a is being taken, and therefore the e1,e2,e3 each has a derivative of identically zero. This often holds true for problems dealing with vector fields in a fixed coordinate system, or for simple problems in physics. However, many complex problems involve the derivative of a vector function in multiple moving reference frames, which means that the basis vectors will not necessarily be constant. In such a case where the basis vectors e1,e2,e3 are fixed in reference frame E, but not in reference frame N, the more general formula for the ordinary time derivative of a vector in reference frame N is :\\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm{N}d\\\\mathbf{a}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\\\frac{da_i}{dt}\\\\mathbf{e}_i + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{3}a_i\\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm{N}d\\\\mathbf{e}_i}{dt} where the superscript N to the left of the derivative operator indicates the reference frame in which the derivative is taken. As shown previously, the first term on the right hand side is equal to the derivative of a in the reference frame where e1,e2,e3 are constant, reference frame E. It also can be shown that the second term on the right hand side is equal to the relative angular velocity of the two reference frames cross multiplied with the vector a itself. Thus, after substitution, the formula relating the derivative of a vector function in two reference frames is :\\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm Nd\\\\mathbf a}{dt} = \\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm Ed\\\\mathbf a }{dt} + {}^\\\\mathrm N \\\\mathbf \\\\omega^\\\\mathrm E \\\\times \\\\mathbf a where NœâE is the angular velocity of the reference frame E relative to the reference frame N. One common example where this formula is used is to find the velocity of a space-borne object, such as a rocket, in the inertial reference frame using measurements of the rocket's velocity relative to the ground. The velocity NvR in inertial reference frame N of a rocket R located at position rR can be found using the formula : \\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm Nd}{dt}(\\\\mathbf r^\\\\mathrm R) = \\\\frac{{}^\\\\mathrm Ed}{dt}(\\\\mathbf r^\\\\mathrm R) + {}^\\\\mathrm N \\\\mathbf \\\\omega^\\\\mathrm E \\\\times \\\\mathbf r^\\\\mathrm R. where NœâE is the angular velocity of the Earth relative to the inertial frame N. Since velocity is the derivative of position, NvR and EvR are the derivatives of rR in reference frames N and E, respectively. By substitution, :{}^\\\\mathrm N \\\\mathbf v^\\\\mathrm R = {}^\\\\mathrm E \\\\mathbf v^\\\\mathrm R + {}^\\\\mathrm N \\\\mathbf \\\\omega^\\\\mathrm E \\\\times \\\\mathbf r^\\\\mathrm R where EvR is the velocity vector of the rocket as measured from a reference frame E that is fixed to the Earth. =Derivative and vector multiplication= The derivative of the products of vector functions behaves similarly to the derivative of the products of scalar functions.In fact, these relations are derived applying the product rule componentwise. Specifically, in the case of scalar multiplication of a vector, if p is a scalar variable function of q, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q}(p\\\\mathbf a) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial q}\\\\mathbf a + p\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf a}{\\\\partial q}. In the case of dot multiplication, for two vectors a and b that are both functions of q, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q}(\\\\mathbf a \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf b) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf a }{\\\\partial q} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf b + \\\\mathbf a \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf b}{\\\\partial q}. Similarly, the derivative of the cross product of two vector functions is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q}(\\\\mathbf a \\\\times \\\\mathbf b) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf a }{\\\\partial q} \\\\times \\\\mathbf b + \\\\mathbf a \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf b}{\\\\partial q}. Derivative of an n-dimensional vector function A function f of a real number t with values in the space \\\\R^n can be written as f(t)=(f_1(t),f_2(t),\\\\ldots,f_n(t)). Its derivative equals :f'(t)=(f_1'(t),f_2'(t),\\\\ldots,f_n'(t)). If f is a function of several variables, say of t\\\\in\\\\R^m, then the partial derivatives of the components of f form a n\\\\times m matrix called the Jacobian matrix of f. Infinite- dimensional vector functions If the values of a function f lie in an infinite-dimensional vector space X, such as a Hilbert space, then f may be called an infinite-dimensional vector function. =Functions with values in a Hilbert space= If the argument of f is a real number and X is a Hilbert space, then the derivative of f at a point t can be defined as in the finite- dimensional case: :f'(t)=\\\\lim_{h\\\\rightarrow0}\\\\frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}. Most results of the finite-dimensional case also hold in the infinite-dimensional case too, mutatis mutandis. Differentiation can also be defined to functions of several variables (e.g., t\\\\in\\\\R^n or even t\\\\in Y, where Y is an infinite- dimensional vector space). N.B. If X is a Hilbert space, then one can easily show that any derivative (and any other limit) can be computed componentwise: if :f=(f_1,f_2,f_3,\\\\ldots) (i.e., f=f_1 e_1+f_2 e_2+f_3 e_3+\\\\cdots, where e_1,e_2,e_3,\\\\ldots is an orthonormal basis of the space X), and f'(t) exists, then :f'(t)=(f_1'(t),f_2'(t),f_3'(t),\\\\ldots). However, the existence of a componentwise derivative does not guarantee the existence of a derivative, as componentwise convergence in a Hilbert space does not guarantee convergence with respect to the actual topology of the Hilbert space. =Other infinite- dimensional vector spaces= Most of the above hold for other topological vector spaces X too. However, not as many classical results hold in the Banach space setting, e.g., an absolutely continuous function with values in a suitable Banach space need not have a derivative anywhere. Moreover, in most Banach spaces setting there are no orthonormal bases.

F. & T. M. Flett The Swedish King John III History of the Scottish sword dance  As a part of the traditional Scottish intangible heritage, the performance of the Sword Dance has been recorded as early as the 15th century. It is normally recognised as the war dance with some ceremonial sense in the Scottish Royal court during that period. The old kings and clan chiefs organised the Highland Games as a method to choose their best men at arms, and the discipline required to perform the Highland dances allowed men to demonstrate their strength, stamina, and agility. The earliest reference also mentioned that the dance is often accompanied with the music of bagpipes. The basic rule requires the dancer to cross two swords on the ground in an \\"X\\" or \\"+\\" shape and to dance around and within the 4 quarters of it. The earliest reference to these dances in Scotland is mentioned in the Scotichronicon, compiled in Scotland by Walter Bower in the 1440s. The passage regards Alexander III and his second marriage to the French lady Yolande de Dreux at Jedburgh in Roxburghshire on 14 October 1285. > At the head of this procession were the skilled musicians with many sorts of > pipe music including the wailing music of bagpipes, and behind them others > splendidly performing a war-dance with intricate weaving in and out. > Bringing up the rear was a figure regarding whom it was difficult to decide > whether it was a man or an apparition. It seemed to glide like a ghost > rather than walk on feet. When it looked as if he would disappear from > everyone's sight, the whole frenzied procession halted, the song died away, > the music faded, and the dancing contingent froze suddenly and unexpectedly. In 1573, Scottish mercenaries are said to have performed a Scottish Sword dance before the Swedish King, John III, at a banquet held in Stockholm Castle. The dance, \\"a natural feature of the festivities,\\" was used as part of a plot to assassinate the King (the Mornay Plot), where the conspirators were able to bare their weapons without arousing suspicion. Fortunately for the King, at the decisive moment the agreed signal was never given. \\"Sword dance and Highland Dances\\" were included at a reception for Anne of Denmark at Edinburgh in 1589 and a mixture of sword dance and acrobatics were performed before James VI in 1617 (New Statistical Account of Scotland Edinb. 1845 x, pp. 44-45) and again for Charles I in 1633, by the Incorporation of Skinners and Glovers of Perth: > His Majesty‚Äôs chair being set upon the wall next to the Water of Tay > whereupon was a floating stage of timber clad about with birks, upon the > which for His Majesty‚Äôs welcome and entry thirteen of our brethren of this > calling of Glovers with green caps, silver strings, red ribbons, white shoes > and bells upon their legs, shearing rapiers in their hands and all other > abulzements, danced our sword dance with many difficult knots and > allapallajesse, five being under and five above upon their shoulders, three > of them dancing through their feet and about them, drinking wine and > breaking glasses. Which (God be praised) was acted and done without hurt or > skaith to any.  Types of sword dance  A performer of the Scottish sword dance, the \\"Gillie Callum\\", in Inverness, c. 1900 Many of the Highland dances now lost were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, a combination of targe and dirk, and the flail. The old Skye dancing song, Bualidh mi u an sa chean (Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann \\"I will break your head\\"), may indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, \\"for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop.\\" C.N. McIntyre North describes a clockwise-moving Sword Dance in his 1880 \\"Book of the Club of True Highlanders\\".\\"Book of the Club of True Highlanders\\" http://www.electricscotland.com/history/club/index.htm McIntyre North describes nine steps. The first step beats the rhythm in time with the tune \\"Gillie Calliun\\" [sic]. A combative sword dance called the Highland Dirk Dance still exists and is often linked to the sword dance or dances called \\"Macinorsair\\" (Mac an Fh√≤rsair), the \\"Broad Sword Exercise\\" or the \\"Bruicheath\\" (Battle Dance). These dances are mentioned in a number of sources, and may have been performed in a variety of different forms, by two performers in a duelling form and as a solo routine. Dance with Highland Regiments The Malagasy Envoys at Cape Town‚ÄîEntertainment at the Officers‚Äô Mess of the 1st Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders =Regimental Tradition= This tradition was gradually kept in the Highlander Regiments with some changing rules. To prepare for the Sword Dance, a soldier should lay two swords on the ground in the form of an X, he would then proceed to dance a complex series of steps and movements between and around the swords to the sound of the bagpipes. The dance itself can be performed with more than one individual. This tradition of exhibition and competitive dancing carried on into the 21st century. It was performed at a Regimental Highland Games C1930s. Four swords are laid on the dance floor in a cross shape. The dancer then performs a number of intricate dance steps across and around the sword blades, keeping their backs straight, arms raised, and hands in a particular shape. Throughout the decades, this style of dance became an integral part of the performance of the pipes and drums band when it went on tour to various countries around the world. Highland country dancing (often a less formal style of dance) was also encouraged within the Regiment. The Sword Dance, 93rd were camped at Chobham in England, 1853 Actually, the weapon in the traditional sword dance is not only the basket-hilted broadsword. In the book ‚ÄúHighland and Traditional Scottish Dances‚Äù, Mr. MacLellan has mentioned when his father was living on Loch Fyneside in Argyll, designed the Foursome Dance over swords as a counter to the Lochaber Dance, which was initially danced over Lochaber axes. The Broadsword indicated the basket-hilted sword worn by officers of Highland Regiments and sometimes miscalled the Claymore, which is a large two-handed weapon. The original version of the Broadswords Dance is described in Mr. MacLellan‚Äôs book, and the steps, four strathspey and one quick‚Äìtime, and drill for marching on and off a dancing stage are simpler and less elaborate than those seen in some present day forms of the dance. It is not an ‚ÄúOld Thyme‚Äù dance and it is not Regimental in origin. =The influence of the Dance in Highland Regiments= rightthumbalt=Highland danceRIT, P and Ds and D Coy with local children who put on a Highland Dancing display in Topermory, Isle of Mull Due to the popularity, it encouraged the recovery of traditional prestige on influence in Highland Dancing culture and competition. It increased more training and intensive preparation, or students amongst students attending the Piping Course in Edinburgh, or schoolboys from Queen Victoria School performing at the Royal Tournament in London and the Festival Tattoo in Edinburgh, due to the Highland Dancing interest. To inspire schoolboys to join the events, the school provided special instruction of Highland Dancing. In the south of England, highland and Scottish country dancing caused a wave of enthusiasm to sweep over the Service Establishments. Many officers of Highland Brigade supported the dancing, and it was taught at the Joint Service Staff College, the Army Staff College, the Royal Navy College, and the Royal Military Academy. The only ‚Äúfortress‚Äù holding out against this Scottish ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù is the R.A.F. Staff College. Pipers of the 1st Battalion perform the Sword Dance The Highland dancers of Regimental Headquarter---Sgt.Oliver, Cpls,Yule and Eliott and Pte. Ferguson---gained notable successes at the Games at Oban on 15 September . The Regimental Foursome won the Alasdair Maclean Challenge Cup for Regimental Reel Dancing, beating the Gordon Highlanders‚Äô and the Highlander Light Infantry Foursomes. Cpl.Yule won the Poltalloch Cup, presented by Colonel George Malcolm, for the non-professional dancer serving in the Armed Forces who obtained the highest aggregate of marks in the four individual dancing competitions. This was the first year of competition for the Cup. The Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing has published its Manual on the technique and performance of the traditional Highland dances, individual and foursome. This is a comprehensive guide, with illustrations of basic positions, movements, and steps. The organisation and conduct of competitions in Highland dancing are also dealt with within the book. =The Regimental Piping and Dancing Society= A Society has been formed to stimulate interest in the playing of the Highland Bagpipe, to create enthusiasm for Highland Dancing, and so raise the level of performance of both these arts in the units of the Regiment. The aims of the Society are:-- A. To assist in the training of pipers and Highland dancers generally in the Regiment, and to watch their progress throughout their Regimental career. B. To standardise settings for pipe music throughout the Regiment. C. To assist pipe presidents in all ways possible in their duties, both technical and administrative, in order to maintain the highest standard of piping and dancing in the Regiment. D. To train judges in piping and dancing for the benefit of Regimental and National competition. A Regimental Committee, representative of all the Battalions of the Regiment, is required to develop the policy of the Society.

Biography Lee was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England. Was a founding member of his first band, The Falcons. He was also a drummer for Ricky Storm and The Mansfields, which he was persuaded to leave in August 1965. Soon he took over drumming duties for The Jaybirds, with guitarist Alvin Lee, and bassist Leo Lyons. In 1966 they arrived in London, where a keyboardist, Chick Churchill also joined the band. In 1968, the band auditioned at the Marquee Club in London under the name The Blues Yard, but quickly became the successful outfit, Ten Years After. With this group, Lee played at rock festivals including Woodstock in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival on 29 August 1970 as well as appearances at The Newport Jazz Festival, The Miami, Atlanta and Texas Pop Festivals. When Ten Years After disbanded in 1976, Lee formed March Music/Fast Western Productions undertaking music publishing, management and record production and signed acts such as the Incredible Kidda Band. In 1994, Lee formed The Breakers with an old friend, Ian Ellis (ex-Clouds) and together they wrote and produced their first studio album \\"MILAN\\", which was released in July 1995. Along with tours of the UK and Europe, The Breakers were guests with Bryan Adams and Bonnie Raitt, on NBC Super Channel's \\"Talking Blues\\" programme that aired in Europe in March 1996. In 2011, Lee formed the 'Ric Lee Blues Project' which was later renamed 'Ric Lee's Natural Born Swingers' for their 2012 album release Put a Record On. The band featured Bob Hall of Savoy Brown, Danny Handley from The Animals and British session bassist Scott Whitley who has worked with many major acts from around the world. The album received substantial airplay on European and internet radio. Handley and Whitely have left the band. John Idan, known for his work with the reformed Yardbirds, joined the band on guitar and vocals. Ten Years After continued touring after Alvin Lee's death (on 6 March 2013) with a lineup featuring originals Chick Churchill and Ric Lee plus two new members: guitarist/vocalist Marcus Bonfanti (British Blues Awards winner) and bassist Colin Hodgkinson. This incarnation released its first studio album, A Sting in the Tale, in 2017. Lee's autobiography From Headstocks To Woodstock was published by Grafika in May 2019. He has two children and lives in the Derbyshire Dales.

He was reviled in Massachusetts and much of the North for his ordering the return of fugitive slaves Thomas Sims and Anthony Burns to slavery in compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. His action would result in his being removed as Judge of Probate. Education and career Born on January 28, 1802,Robert Manson Myers, ed., The Children of Pride (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972), p. 1598. in Boston, Massachusetts, Loring received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1821 from Harvard University and read law with Charles Greely Loring in Boston in 1824. He entered private practice and concurrently served as a master in chancery in Suffolk County, Massachusetts starting in 1824. He was a United States Commissioner for the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1840 to 1855. He was a Judge of Probate for Suffolk County from 1847 to 1858. He was a lecturer for Dane Law School (now Harvard Law School) at Harvard University from 1852 to 1855. =Fugitive slave ruling and aftermath= As United States Commissioner of the United States District Court, Loring was responsible for issuing warrants for arrest and ruling in cases under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which was widely opposed in Boston and the North. In 1851, an escaped slave named Thomas Sims was captured in Boston; Loring ordered his return to slavery in the South, as required by the new law. Boston abolitionists were outraged. In 1854, Loring ordered another escaped slave, Anthony Burns, returned to slavery in Virginia. During the prosecution of this case there was an attack on the courthouse in which James Batchelder, a 24-year-old police officer temporarily employed by the United States Marshal, was stabbed to death.Robert Manson Myers, ed., The Children of Pride (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972), p. 1462. Widespread protests marked the trial and its aftermath. President Franklin Pierce felt obliged to send United States troops to ensure that the ruling be carried out. Following the Burns decision, abolitionists led by William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips agitated for Loring to be removed from his office as probate judge.

Though he had assisted Burns in his court case, attorney Richard Henry Dana Jr. defended Loring before the legislature. Under pressure from an increasingly antislavery public, the legislature made two unsuccessful attempts to remove Loring from office by passing a Bill of Address in 1855 and 1856. Governor Henry J. Gardner, elected as a candidate of the Know-Nothing Party, declined to remove him. In 1857, after the Republican Nathaniel Prentice Banks was elected Governor of Massachusetts, the legislature passed another Bill of Address against Loring. The new governor complied and removed Loring from office.\\"History of the Bill of Address\\", Article 8 Alliance.

Life Farina was born at Mantua. He presumably received his first lessons from his father, who was sonatore di viola at the court of the Gonzaga in that city. Later he got further education probably by Salomone Rossi and Giovanni Battista Buonamente. From 1626 to 1629, he worked as concertmaster in Dresden. In Dresden he worked with Heinrich Sch√ºtz, who interested him in composing. From 1629 to 1631, he was a prominent member of the electoral court orchestra in Bonn, until he returned to Italy, where he worked in Parma and later in Lucca until 1635. In 1635 he held position at the court of Carlo I Cybo-Malaspina, Prince of Massa, and between 1636 and 1637 in Gda≈Ñsk. From 1638 he lived in Vienna, where he died of the plague probably a year later. He is considered to be one of the earliest violin virtuosos and he made many contributions to violin technique. For example, in his work Capriccio Stravagante (1627) he used the violin to imitate animal sounds like dogs barking or cats fighting.

It makes use of hardware features such as the NX bit (no- execute bit), or in some cases software emulation of those features. However technologies that somehow emulate or supply an NX bit will usually impose a measurable overhead; while using a hardware-supplied NX bit imposes no measurable overhead. The Burroughs 5000 offered hardware support for executable-space protection on its introduction in 1961; that capability remained in its successors until at least 2006. In its implementation of tagged architecture, each word of memory had an associated, hidden tag bit designating it code or data. Thus user programs cannot write or even read a program word, and data words cannot be executed. If an operating system can mark some or all writable regions of memory as non-executable, it may be able to prevent the stack and heap memory areas from being executable. This helps to prevent certain buffer-overflow exploits from succeeding, particularly those that inject and execute code, such as the Sasser and Blaster worms. These attacks rely on some part of memory, usually the stack, being both writeable and executable; if it is not, the attack fails. OS implementations Many operating systems implement or have an available executable space protection policy. Here is a list of such systems in alphabetical order, each with technologies ordered from newest to oldest. For some technologies, there is a summary which gives the major features each technology supports. The summary is structured as below. * Hardware Supported Processors: (Comma separated list of CPU architectures) * Emulation: (No) or (Architecture Independent) or (Comma separated list of CPU architectures) * Other Supported: (None) or (Comma separated list of CPU architectures) * Standard Distribution: (No) or (Yes) or (Comma separated list of distributions or versions which support the technology) * Release Date: (Date of first release) A technology supplying Architecture Independent emulation will be functional on all processors which aren't hardware supported. The \\"Other Supported\\" line is for processors which allow some grey-area method, where an explicit NX bit doesn't exist yet hardware allows one to be emulated in some way. =Android= As of Android 2.3 and later, architectures which support it have non-executable pages by default, including non-executable stack and heap. \\"Memory Management Security Enhancements\\", Android Security Overview, retrieved 2012/07/29. =FreeBSD= Initial support for the NX bit, on x86-64 and IA-32 processors that support it, first appeared in FreeBSD -CURRENT on June 8, 2004. It has been in FreeBSD releases since the 5.3 release. =Linux= The Linux kernel supports the NX bit on x86-64 and IA-32 processors that support it, such as modern 64-bit processors made by AMD, Intel, Transmeta and VIA. The support for this feature in the 64-bit mode on x86-64 CPUs was added in 2004 by Andi Kleen, and later the same year, Ingo Molnar added support for it in 32-bit mode on 64-bit CPUs. These features have been part of the Linux kernel mainline since the release of kernel version 2.6.8 in August 2004. The availability of the NX bit on 32-bit x86 kernels, which may run on both 32-bit x86 CPUs and 64-bit IA-32-compatible CPUs, is significant because a 32-bit x86 kernel would not normally expect the NX bit that an AMD64 or IA-64 supplies; the NX enabler patch assures that these kernels will attempt to use the NX bit if present. Some desktop Linux distributions, such as Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE, do not enable the HIGHMEM64 option by default in their default kernels, which is required to gain access to the NX bit in 32-bit mode, because the PAE mode that is required to use the NX bit causes boot failures on pre-Pentium Pro (including Pentium MMX) and Celeron M and Pentium M processors without NX support. Other processors that do not support PAE are AMD K6 and earlier, Transmeta Crusoe, VIA C3 and earlier, and Geode GX and LX. VMware Workstation versions older than 4.0, Parallels Workstation versions older than 4.0, and Microsoft Virtual PC and Virtual Server do not support PAE on the guest. Fedora Core 6 and Ubuntu 9.10 and later provide a kernel-PAE package which supports PAE and NX. NX memory protection has always been available in Ubuntu for any systems that had the hardware to support it and ran the 64-bit kernel or the 32-bit server kernel. The 32-bit PAE desktop kernel (linux-image-generic-pae) in Ubuntu 9.10 and later, also provides the PAE mode needed for hardware with the NX CPU feature. For systems that lack NX hardware, the 32-bit kernels now provide an approximation of the NX CPU feature via software emulation that can help block many exploits an attacker might run from stack or heap memory. Non-execute functionality has also been present for other non-x86 processors supporting this functionality for many releases. Exec Shield Red Hat kernel developer Ingo Molnar released a Linux kernel patch named Exec Shield to approximate and utilize NX functionality on 32-bit x86 CPUs. The Exec Shield patch was released to the Linux kernel mailing list on May 2, 2003, but was rejected for merging with the base kernel because it involved some intrusive changes to core code in order to handle the complex parts of the emulation. Exec Shield's legacy CPU support approximates NX emulation by tracking the upper code segment limit. This imposes only a few cycles of overhead during context switches, which is for all intents and purposes immeasurable. For legacy CPUs without an NX bit, Exec Shield fails to protect pages below the code segment limit; an mprotect() call to mark higher memory, such as the stack, executable will mark all memory below that limit executable as well. Thus, in these situations, Exec Shield's schemes fails. This is the cost of Exec Shield's low overhead. Exec Shield checks for two ELF header markings, which dictate whether the stack or heap needs to be executable. These are called PT_GNU_STACK and PT_GNU_HEAP respectively. Exec Shield allows these controls to be set for both binary executables and for libraries; if an executable loads a library requiring a given restriction relaxed, the executable will inherit that marking and have that restriction relaxed. * Hardware Supported Processors: All that Linux supports NX on * Emulation: NX approximation using the code segment limit on IA-32 (x86) and compatible * Other Supported: None * Standard Distribution: Fedora Core and Red Hat Enterprise Linux * Release Date: May 2, 2003 PaX The PaX NX technology can emulate NX functionality, or use a hardware NX bit. PaX works on x86 CPUs that do not have the NX bit, such as 32-bit x86. The Linux kernel still does not ship with PaX (as of May, 2007); the patch must be merged manually. PaX provides two methods of NX bit emulation, called SEGMEXEC and PAGEEXEC. The SEGMEXEC method imposes a measurable but low overhead, typically less than 1%, which is a constant scalar incurred due to the virtual memory mirroring used for the separation between execution and data accesses. SEGMEXEC also has the effect of halving the task's virtual address space, allowing the task to access less memory than it normally could. This is not a problem until the task requires access to more than half the normal address space, which is rare. SEGMEXEC does not cause programs to use more system memory (i.e. RAM), it only restricts how much they can access. On 32-bit CPUs, this becomes 1.5 GB rather than 3 GB. PaX supplies a method similar to Exec Shield's approximation in the PAGEEXEC as a speedup; however, when higher memory is marked executable, this method loses its protections. In these cases, PaX falls back to the older, variable-overhead method used by PAGEEXEC to protect pages below the CS limit, which may become quite a high-overhead operation in certain memory access patterns. When the PAGEEXEC method is used on a CPU supplying a hardware NX bit, the hardware NX bit is used, thus no significant overhead is incurred. PaX supplies mprotect() restrictions to prevent programs from marking memory in ways that produce memory useful for a potential exploit. This policy causes certain applications to cease to function, but it can be disabled for affected programs. PaX allows individual control over the following functions of the technology for each binary executable: *PAGEEXEC *SEGMEXEC * mprotect() restrictions * Trampoline emulation * Randomized executable base * Randomized mmap() base PaX ignores both PT_GNU_STACK and PT_GNU_HEAP. In the past, PaX had a configuration option to honor these settings but that option has been removed for security reasons, as it was deemed not useful. The same results of PT_GNU_STACK can normally be attained by disabling mprotect() restrictions, as the program will normally mprotect() the stack on load. This may not always be true; for situations where this fails, simply disabling both PAGEEXEC and SEGMEXEC will effectively remove all executable space restrictions, giving the task the same protections on its executable space as a non-PaX system. * Hardware Supported Processors: Alpha, AMD64, IA-64, MIPS (32 and 64 bit), PA-RISC, PowerPC, SPARC * Emulation: IA-32 (x86) * Other Supported: PowerPC (32 and 64 bit), SPARC (32 and 64 bit) * Standard Distribution: Alpine Linux * Release Date: October 1, 2000 =macOS = macOS for Intel supports the NX bit on all CPUs supported by Apple (from Mac OS X 10.4.4 ‚Äì the first Intel release ‚Äì onwards). Mac OS X 10.4 only supported NX stack protection. In Mac OS X 10.5, all 64-bit executables have NX stack and heap; W^X protection. This includes x86-64 (Core 2 or later) and 64-bit PowerPC on the G5 Macs. =NetBSD= As of NetBSD 2.0 and later (December 9, 2004), architectures which support it have non-executable stack and heap. NetBSD, Non-executable stack and heap, retrieved 2011/07/14. Architectures that have per-page granularity consist of: alpha, amd64, hppa, i386 (with PAE), powerpc (ibm4xx), sh5, sparc (sun4m, sun4d), sparc64. Architectures that can only support these with region granularity are: i386 (without PAE), other powerpc (such as macppc). Other architectures do not benefit from non-executable stack or heap; NetBSD does not by default use any software emulation to offer these features on those architectures. =OpenBSD= A technology in the OpenBSD operating system, known as W^X, marks writable pages by default as non-executable on processors that support that. On 32-bit x86 processors, the code segment is set to include only part of the address space, to provide some level of executable space protection. OpenBSD 3.3 shipped May 1, 2003, and was the first to include W^X. * Hardware Supported Processors: Alpha, AMD64, HPPA, SPARC * Emulation: IA-32 (x86) * Other Supported: None * Standard Distribution: Yes * Release Date: May 1, 2003 =Solaris= Solaris has supported globally disabling stack execution on SPARC processors since Solaris 2.6 (1997); in Solaris 9 (2002), support for disabling stack execution on a per-executable basis was added. =Windows= Starting with Windows XP Service Pack 2 (2004) and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (2005), the NX features were implemented for the first time on the x86 architecture. Executable space protection on Windows is called \\"Data Execution Prevention\\" (DEP). Under Windows XP or Server 2003 NX protection was used on critical Windows services exclusively by default. If the x86 processor supported this feature in hardware, then the NX features were turned on automatically in Windows XP/Server 2003 by default. If the feature was not supported by the x86 processor, then no protection was given. Early implementations of DEP provided no address space layout randomization (ASLR), which allowed potential return-to-libc attacks that could have been feasibly used to disable DEP during an attack. The PaX documentation elaborates on why ASLR is necessary;http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt a proof-of-concept was produced detailing a method by which DEP could be circumvented in the absence of ASLR. It may be possible to develop a successful attack if the address of prepared data such as corrupted images or MP3s can be known by the attacker. Microsoft added ASLR functionality in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. On this platform, DEP is implemented through the automatic use of PAE kernel in 32-bit Windows and the native support on 64-bit kernels. Windows Vista DEP works by marking certain parts of memory as being intended to hold only data, which the NX or XD bit enabled processor then understands as non- executable. In Windows, from version Vista, whether DEP is enabled or disabled for a particular process can be viewed on the Processes/Details tab in the Windows Task Manager. Windows implements software DEP (without the use of the NX bit) through Microsoft's \\"Safe Structured Exception Handling\\" (SafeSEH). For properly compiled applications, SafeSEH checks that, when an exception is raised during program execution, the exception's handler is one defined by the application as it was originally compiled. The effect of this protection is that an attacker is not able to add his own exception handler which he has stored in a data page through unchecked program input. When NX is supported, it is enabled by default. Windows allows programs to control which pages disallow execution through its API as well as through the section headers in a PE file. In the API, runtime access to the NX bit is exposed through the Win32 API calls VirtualAlloc[Ex] and VirtualProtect[Ex]. Each page may be individually flagged as executable or non-executable. Despite the lack of previous x86 hardware support, both executable and non-executable page settings have been provided since the beginning. On pre-NX CPUs, the presence of the 'executable' attribute has no effect. It was documented as if it did function, and, as a result, most programmers used it properly. In the PE file format, each section can specify its executability. The execution flag has existed since the beginning of the format and standard linkers have always used this flag correctly, even long before the NX bit. Because of this, Windows is able to enforce the NX bit on old programs. Assuming the programmer complied with \\"best practices\\", applications should work correctly now that NX is actually enforced. Only in a few cases have there been problems; Microsoft's own .NET Runtime had problems with the NX bit and was updated. * Hardware Supported Processors: x86-64 (AMD64 and Intel 64), IA-64, Efficeon, Pentium M (later revisions), AMD Sempron (later revisions) * Emulation: Yes * Other Supported: None * Standard Distribution: Post Windows XP * Release Date: August 6, 2004 =Xbox= In Microsoft's Xbox, although the CPU does not have the NX bit, newer versions of the XDK set the code segment limit to the beginning of the kernel's .data section (no code should be after this point in normal circumstances). Starting with version 51xx, this change was also implemented into the kernel of new Xboxes. This broke the techniques old exploits used to become a TSR. However, new versions were quickly released supporting this new version because the fundamental exploit was unaffected.  Limitations  Where code is written and executed at runtime‚Äîa JIT compiler is a prominent example‚Äîthe compiler can potentially be used to produce exploit code (e.g. using JIT Spray) that has been flagged for execution and therefore would not be trapped. Return-oriented programming can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code even when executable space protection is enforced.

Concept The \\"benkan\\" of Emperor Komei The term was coined early in the 20th century by Nichiren Buddhist activist and nationalist Tanaka Chigaku, who cobbled it from parts of a statement attributed in the chronicle Nihon Shoki to legendary first Emperor Jimmu at the time of his ascension.As early as 1928, the Japanese editorials were already preaching the theme of the hakko ichiu without using the specific term. Michio Nakajima, Tenn≈ç no daigawari to kokumin, Aoki Shoten 1990, pp. 129‚Äì30. The Emperor's full statement reads: \\"Hakk≈ç wo ooute ie to nasan\\" (, or in the original kanbun: ), and means: \\"I shall cover the eight directions and make them my abode\\". The term hakk≈ç (), meaning \\"eight crown cords\\" (\\"crown cords\\" being the hanging decorations of the benkan (ÂÜïÂÜ†), a traditional Chinese-styled crown), was a metaphor for happ≈ç () or \\"eight directions\\".Jit≈ç ,Shirakawa Shizuka, Heibonsha, 1994, p. 302, entry. The kun-reading ie for on-reading u is now defunct, but at the time of the Nihon Shoki, readings were not yet fixed in the way that was later to become the case. Rather, any meaning associated with a Chinese character as used in Chinese was, in theory, available as a reading as evidenced by the sometimes extreme variation in the writing of even common words in the Nihon Shoki. Ambiguous in its original context, Tanaka interpreted the statement attributed to Jinmu, as meaning that imperial rule had been divinely ordained to expand until it united the entire world. While Tanaka saw this outcome as resulting from the emperor's moral leadership, many of his followers were less pacifist in their outlook, despite some intellectuals' awareness of the inherent nationalist implications and reactions to this term. Koyama Iwao (1905‚Äì93), disciple of Nishida, and drawing off the Flower Adornment Sutra, proposed the interpretation \\"to be included or to find a place\\". This understanding was rejected by the military circles of the nationalist right.See also Kosei Ishii Racial equality and growing expansionism Founding Ceremony of the Hakko-Ichiu Monument on April 3, 1940. It had Prince Chichibu's calligraphy of Hakk≈ç ichiu, carved on its front side.David C. Earhart, Certain Victory, 2008, p. 63.

Their proposal received the support of a majority but was vetoed by Woodrow Wilson, in violation of the rules of the Conference on majority vote. In 1924, the U.S. Congress enacted the Asian Exclusion Act, outlawing immigration from Asia. On December 6, 1938, the Five ministers council (Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, Army Minister Seishir≈ç Itagaki, Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai, Foreign Minister Hachir≈ç Arita and Finance Minister Shigeaki Ikeda), which was the highest decision making council at the time, took the decision to prohibit the expulsion of the Jews from Japan, Manchuria, and China in accordance with the spirit of racial equality. Thereafter, the Japanese received Jewish refugees despite their ally Nazi Germany's opposition. With the economic impact of the Sh≈çwa financial crisis and the Great Depression, this led in the 1930s to a resurgence of nationalist, militarist and expansionist movements. Emperor Sh≈çwa (known more commonly as Hirohito outside of Japan) and his reign became associated with the rediscovery of Hakk≈ç ichiu as an expansionist element of Japanese nationalistic beliefs.Bix, Herbert. (2001). Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, p. 201. The naval limitations treaties of 1921, and especially 1930, were seen as a mistake in their unanticipated effect on internal political struggles in Japan; and the treaties provided an external motivating catalyst which provoked reactionary, militarist elements to desperate actions which eventually overwhelmed civilian and liberal elements in society.Morison, Samuel Eliot. (1948). History of United States Naval Operations in World War II: The Battle of the Atlantic, September 1939 ‚Äì May 1943, pp. 3‚Äì10. The evolution of Hakk≈ç ichiu serves as a changing litmus test of these factional relationships during the next decade.John Pike, (2011). \\"Kodo (Way of the Emperor)\\". GlobalSecurity.org The term Hakk≈ç ichiu did not enter general circulation until 1940, when the second Konoe administration issued a white paper titled \\"Fundamental National Policy\\" ( Kihon Kokusaku Y≈çk≈ç), which opened with these words, and in which Prime Minister Konoe proclaimed that the basic aim of Japan's national policy was \\"the establishment of world peace in conformity with the very spirit in which our nation was founded\\"Edwards, p. 309. In the original text, and that the first step was the proclamation of a \\"new order in East Asia\\" ( T≈ça Shin Chitsujo), which later took the form of the \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\".James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 470 In the most magnanimous form, the term was used to indicate the making of a universal brotherhood implemented by the uniquely virtuous Yamato.Piers Brendon, The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s, p43 Because this would bring people under the emperor's fatherly benevolence, force was justified against those who resisted.Herbert P. Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan p 11 1940 was declared the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan in part in celebration of hakk≈ç ichiu.Edwin P. Hoyt, Japan's War, p 196 As part of the celebrations, the government officially opened the Hakko- ichiu Monument (now Heiwadai Tower) at what is now Miyazaki Peace Park in the city of Miyazaki. World War II As the Second Sino-Japanese War dragged on without conclusion, the Japanese government turned increasingly to the nation's spiritual capital to maintain fighting spirit. Characterization of the fighting as a , similarly grounding the current conflict in the nation's sacred beginnings, became increasingly evident in the Japanese press at this time. In 1940, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was launched to provide political support to Japan's war in China. The general spread of the term Hakk≈ç ichiu, neatly encapsulating this view of expansion as mandated in Japan's divine origin, was further propelled by preparations for celebrating the 2600th anniversary of Jimmu's ascension, which fell in the year 1940 according to the traditional chronology. Stories recounted that Jimmu, finding five races in Japan, had made them all as \\"brothers of one family\\".John W. Dower, War Without Mercy: Race & Power in the Pacific War p223 =Propaganda purposes= After Japan declared war on the Allies in December 1941, Allied governments produced several propaganda films citing the Hakk≈ç ichiu as evidence that the Japanese intended to conquer the entire world. The official translation offered by contemporary leaders was \\"universal brotherhood\\", but it was widely acknowledged that that expression meant that the Japanese were \\"equal to the Caucasians but, to the peoples of Asia, we act as their leader\\".Stephen S. Large. Sh≈çwa Japan. New York: Taylor & Francis, 1998. p. 202. Hence Hakk≈ç ichiu meant to signify racial harmony and equality. In general, however, the subsequent brutality and racism of the Japanese led to people of the occupied areas regarding the new Japanese imperialists as equal to or sometimes worse than Western imperialists. The Japanese government directed that local economies be managed strictly for the production of raw war materials for the Japanese.James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 495 As part of its war effort, Japanese propaganda included phrases such as \\"Asia for the Asians!\\" and emphasized about the perceived need to liberate Asian countries from imperialist powers.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion: World War II, p248 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York The failure to win the war in China was blamed on British and American exploitation of Southeast Asian colonies, even though the Chinese received far more assistance from the Soviet Union.James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 471 In some cases local populations welcomed Japanese troops when they invaded, driving out British, French and other colonial powers. =Allied judgment= Hakk≈ç Ichiu meant the bringing together of the corners of the world under one ruler, or the making of the world one family. This was the alleged ideal of the foundation of the Empire; and in its traditional context meant no more than a universal principle of humanity, which was destined ultimately to pervade the whole universe. The way to the realisation of Hakk≈ç Ichiu was through the benign rule of the Emperor; and therefore the \\"way of the Emperor\\"‚Äîthe \\"Imperial\\" or the \\"Kingly way\\"‚Äîwas a concept of virtue, and a maxim of conduct. Hakk≈ç Ichiu was the moral goal; and loyalty to the Emperor was the road which led to it. Throughout the years that followed measures of military aggression were advocated in the names of Hakk≈ç ichiu eventually became symbols for world domination through military force. Aftermath Hakk≈ç ichiu monument (renamed Tower of Peace) in 2010 Since the end of the Pacific War, some have highlighted the Hakk≈ç ichiu slogan as part of a context of historical revisionism.Goodman, David G. \\"Visas and Virtue by Chris Tashima\\" [review], Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Winter, 2000), pp. 266‚Äì269; excerpt, \\"Japanese historical revisionists, however, assert that Sugihara was not in fact a renegade but an exemplary diplomat who ... dutifully carrying out the high-minded Japanese policy of racial harmony under the aegis of the emperor (hakko ichiu)\\" The Hakk≈ç ichiu monument was renamed in 1958 and still stands today. The writing \\"Hakk≈ç ichiu\\" was removed from it after the Japanese defeat at the insistence of the U.S. military. The tower was the inception point for the torch relay of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Subsequent to the Olympics, which coincided with worldwide interest in the Japanese Imperial family, the local tourism association successfully petitioned the Miyazaki Prefecture to re-install the \\"Hakk≈ç ichiu\\" characters.

She attended Girls' High School in Bedstuy and subsequently enrolled in Hunter College, City University of New York, with plans of becoming a social worker. She took ill during college and took a year off, during which time she decided to major in English Literature, eventually earning her Bachelor of Arts degree at Brooklyn College in 1953 and her master's degree at Hunter College in 1955.Cardwel,Candace, \\"Marshall, Paule\\", in Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present, Oxford University Press, USA, 2009, p. 263.

Early in her career, she wrote poetry, but later returned to prose, her debut novel being published in 1959. Brown Girl, Brownstones tells the story of Selina Boyce, a girl growing up in a small black immigrant community. Selina is caught between her mother, who wants to conform to the ideals of her new home and make the American dream come true, and her father, who longs to go back to Barbados.

It is near the estuary of the River Alde on the North Sea coast and is located south east of Snape and due north of Orford. To its west is Tunstall Forest, created since the 1920's by the Forestry Commission and now part of the Sandlings Forest. Iken was part of Sudbourne Hall Estate. It was comprised largely of tenant farms and cottages for farm workers. The owners of the estate valued the area more for shooting than farming, and a decoy pond was built at Iken in the eighteenth century. Since the break up of the Estate Iken has remained a \\"close\\" village: only a handful of new houses have been built and no council houses have ever been built. In the pre-railway era Iken Cliff was a commercial area used for transporting coal and wheat, and there was a public house near the shore. Flat barges used to sit on the mud at low tide and goods were moved in wheelbarrows. The last heathland around Iken Cliff was ploughed up after the second world war. The population reached a peak of 380 in 1840, steadily declining to around 100. During World War 2 most of Iken and the neighbouring village of Sudbourne were used as a battle training area in advance of the D-Day landings in June 1944. The inhabitants were relocated returning sometime after the war finished. Benjamin Britten set his opera The Little Sweep in Iken Hall, then the home of Margery Spring Rice, who was one of the founders of the Aldeburgh Festival. Britten, who then lived at Snape, was involved in an unsuccessful campaign to keep open a footpath along the Alde to Iken Church. St Botolph‚Äôs Church , formerly an island in what was a marsh at the edge of the estuary, is the most likely site of Saint Botolph's Abbey, Ikenhoe. During excavations in 1977 Dr Stanley West discovered part of a large stone Saxon cross incorporated into the wall of St Botolph's Church tower. The Cross was carved with the heads of dogs and wolves, symbols which were traditionally recognised as St Botolph's emblems during the Middle Ages and therefore it is thought that the cross may originally have been a memorial to him. The Church is Grade II listed; it is the only listed building in the village. At the time of the most recent amendment to the listing (1984), the church was still burnt out. The nave is the oldest part, dating from before 1200. The chancel fell into disuse after the Reformation, and was in ruins by the 18th century. It was rebuilt in 1853. The tower is 15th century. The church suffered a devastating fire in 1968, caused by sparks from a bonfire. It is one of 18 churches in the Wilford Benefice Group of Churches. Features inside the church include a war memorial in the Church to the ten men of the village who died in WWI, an Orthodox icon to St Botolph, and a 15th century octagonal font. Julian Tennyson, (1915-1945), writer and historian, most famous for his writings on his home county of Suffolk, is commemorated by a headstone in the churchyard of St Botolph's. The former rectory next door, now the Anchorage, was sold to a private individual after the second world war, and as a result of a conveyancing mistake, access to the church was greatly restricted by the new owner. Governance There is a parish council. Iken was brought to national attention, in the aftermath of the fire, by the decision of the renowned judge, Sir Robert Megarry, to conduct a hearing in person at Iken, partly to take evidence from a witness who was unable to travel to London and partly to conduct a mock funeral in order to test a disputed right of way.St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Diocesan Board of Finance v Clark [1973] 3 All ER 902 and St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Diocesan Board of Finance v Clark (No. 2) [1975] 1 All ER 772. The result of that litigation had the effect of requiring the materials for the rebuilding of the church in by foot.

According to the 2019 national population census, as reported by the Daily Nation, Ruiru is the 6th largest urban center in Kenya. Location Ruiru is located about , by road, northeast of the central business district of Nairobi, the nation's capital city. The town measures and is connected to Nairobi by both road and rail. The geographical coordinates of Ruiru are: 1¬∞10'04.0\\"S, 36¬∞58'24.0\\"E (Latitude:-1.167778; Longitude:36.973333). The town sits at an average elevation of , above sea level. History This area was a sisal and coffee growing district with sisal on either side of the river to the right of the main road to Thika. As can be seen it is now a housing area. There used to be four main manager houses on the estate on the South side of the river. The area was given over to an African consortium to be developed into small holdings in the 1970s. Population In 2009, Ruiru's population was enumerated at 238,858 residents. Ten years later, the 2019 national census enumerated the population of the town at 490,120. The rapid population growth is attributable to several factors. One factor, is the shortage of affordable residential housing in Nairobi. Another factor being the infrastructure development especially Thika Road and Nairobi Eastern Bypass Highway. as well as the associated commercial and residential development that followed the new highways. A third factor is the presence of university campuses in or near Ruiru. Education Two universities maintain their main campuses in Ruiru. One is Kenyatta University and the other in Zetech University. The University of Nairobi and other institutions of higher education maintain campuses in or near Ruiru. Economy East African Power & Lighting building in Ruiru on the Nairobi-Thika highway, taken in about 1960 Ruiru is also an industrial town with several major factories, including Devki Steel Mills, Super Foam Limited, Spinners & Spinners Garment Factory and Ruiru Feeds Limited. The town is well served by banks and shopping malls and currently is enjoying a housing boom, as many coffee estates are converted into residential areas, including an upcoming multi-billion Tatu Estate. Information and Communication Technology businesses are also emerging, including SmartEdge PASHA Center, a digital village where the community can buy computers and get free computer training.

He numbered among his close friends George Eastman, Ian Fleming and Winston Churchill. Early years Frederick Sidney Cotton was born on 17 June 1894 on a cattle station at Goorganga, near Proserpine, Queensland.Cotton 1969, p. 17. He was the third child of Alfred and Annie Cotton, who were involved in pastoralism. Cotton was educated at The Southport School in Queensland and later in 1910, he and his family went to England where he attended Cheltenham College; however the family returned to Australia in 1912. Cotton worked as a jackeroo, training to work with livestock at stations in New South Wales up until the outbreak of war. First World War Cotton went back to England to join the Royal Naval Air Service in November 1915. After only five hours solo flying, he qualified as a combat pilot, and initially flew Channel patrols. Cotton went on to participate in night bombing sorties over France and Germany with Nos 3 and 5 Wings. His experience with high level and low-temperature flying led Cotton in 1917 to develop the revolutionary new \\"Sidcot\\" suit, a flying suit which solved the problem pilots had in keeping warm in the cockpit. This flying suit was widely used by the RAF until the 1950s. Cotton continued with No. 8 Squadron RNAS in 1917 where he was promoted to Flight Sub-Lieutenant in June 1917. Soon after, he came into conflict with senior officers, and resigned his commission in October 1917.Cotton 1969 Between the wars After leaving military service, Cotton married in London a 17-year-old actress, Regmor Agnes Maclean, in October 1917, with whom he had a son. After the war he spent time in Tasmania, then returned to England where he continued his passion for flying. In 1920, he embarked on an unsuccessful attempt to fly from England to South Africa, and also made a lucky escape from a crash at the Aerial Derby. Cotton then spent three years working in Newfoundland flying various assignments. Following the divorce from his first wife the previous year, in 1926, Cotton married 18-year-old Millicent Joan Henry whom he had met in Canada. From this time up until the outbreak of the Second World War, Cotton led a colourful and eventful life; he took part in various business activities, including an airborne seal-spotting service as well as aerial search and rescue operations for lost explorers in Newfoundland and Greenland. Spy missions Shortly before the Second World War, Cotton was recruited by Fred Winterbotham (then of MI6) to take clandestine aerial photographs of the German military buildup. Using his status as a wealthy and prominent private aviator currently promoting his film business (and using a series of other subterfuges including taking on the guise of an archaeologist or a film producer looking for locations), a series of flights provided valuable information about German naval activity and troop buildups. He equipped the civilian Lockheed 12A business aircraft, G-AFTL, with three F24 cameras concealed behind panels which could be slid aside and operated by pressing a button under the pilot's seat, and a Leica behind a similar panel in the wings. Warm cabin air was diverted to prevent condensation on optical surfaces. Cotton took his secretary Patricia Martin along, and she too took photographs in flight. Although his flight plans were dictated by the German government, he consistently managed to get away with flying off-track over military installations. Cotton had a very persuasive manner, and exploited any advantage he could. In 1939, Cotton took aerial photos during a flight over parts of the Middle East and North Africa. On the eve of war, he even managed to engineer a \\"joy-ride\\" over German military airfields on one occasion, accompanied by senior Luftwaffe officer Albert Kesselring. With Kesselring at the controls, Cotton reached under his seat, operated the cameras, and captured the airfield on film. Cotton later offered to fly Hermann G√∂ring to London for talks a week before outbreak of hostilities, and claimed that his was the last civilian aircraft to leave Berlin before the outbreak of hostilities. One biography is titled Sidney Cotton: The Last Plane Out of Berlin commemorating this escapade. Second World War Appointed as a Squadron Leader and honorary Wing Commander on 22 September 1939, in the same period, Cotton was recruited to head up the fledgling RAF 1 Photographic Development Unit (PDU) at Heston Aerodrome. This unit provided important intelligence leading to successful air raids on key enemy installations.Cotton 1969, p. 156. With his experience and knowledge gained over Germany and other overflights, Cotton greatly improved the RAF's photo reconnaissance capabilities. The PDU was originally equipped with Bristol Blenheims, but Cotton considered these quite unsuitable, being far too slow, and he consequently \\"wheedled\\" a couple of Supermarine Spitfires. These Spitfires, later augmented by de Havilland Mosquitos, were steadily adapted to fly higher and faster, with a highly polished surface, a special blue ‚Äì \\"PRU Blue\\" ‚Äì camouflage scheme developed by Cotton himself, and a series of modifications to the engines to produce more power at high altitudes. In 1940, Cotton also personally made another important reconnaissance flight with his Lockheed 12A over Azerbaijan via Iraq as part of Operation Pike. Under his leadership, the 1 PDU acquired the nicknames, \\"Cotton's Club\\" or the less flattering \\"Cotton's Crooks\\" (mainly due to Cotton's propensity to flout regulations). Cotton revelled in his reputation as unorthodox, and even had a special badge struck bearing the initials \\"CC-11\\" that signified the 11th commandment ‚Äì \\"Thou shalt not be found out.\\"Watson, Jeff. \\"Picture-Perfect Spy.\\" defence.gov.au. Retrieved: 5 November 2009. Cotton's aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of the 1 PDU, he pioneered the techniques of high-altitude, high-speed stereoscopic photography that were instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. R.V. Jones recounts in his memoirs how these photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. By mid-1940 however, Cotton had clashed with senior officials in the Air Ministry over his participation in the evacuation of British agents from France under the cover name of \\"Special Survey Flights.\\" After his return from France couriering Marcel Boussac, the head of the Christian Dior garment and perfume empire, for a fee, he was removed from his post and banned from any involvement with air operations. Following several efforts to be reinstated, even involving Churchill himself, Cotton resigned his commission; he was nevertheless appointed an OBE.Cotton 1969, pp. 164‚Äì167. For the remainder of the war, Cotton acted as an unofficial consultant to the Admiralty. Under the new designation, 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), based at RAF Benson, 1 PRU went on to a distinguished wartime record, eventually operating five squadrons out of a number of bases. Succeeding commanding officers would emulate the spirit and innovative techniques pioneered by Cotton. Sidney Cotton's postwar Lockheed 12A In September 1940, Cotton's modified Lockheed 12A (G-AFTL), was severely damaged in an air raid at Heston Aerodrome. It was rebuilt by Lockheed, sold in British Honduras, and in 1948 registered in the US as N12EJ; the aircraft resided in Florida in 1992.\\"History and image of G-AFTL.\\" orpheusweb.co. Retrieved: 3 August 2011. His postwar Lockheed 12A (G-AGTL) also survives in France in 2005. In September 1940, Cotton pursued the idea of an airborne searchlight for night- fighters, that he termed \\"Aerial Target Illumination\\" (ATI). He enlisted the help of William Helmore, and they jointly took out patents on the techniques (GB574970 and GB575093). Helmore, a serving RAF officer, then sponsored the development of what became known as Turbinlite.Cotton 1969, pp. 205‚Äì211.Cotton, Frederick Sidney and William Helmore. \\"An improved method and means for intercepting night flying hostile aircraft.\\" GB Patent 574970, 29 January 1946. Post-World War II Like many such \\"larger-than-life\\" wartime figures, Cotton did not thrive in post-war civilian life. He was reluctant to profit from his wartime innovations and even waived his patent rights on the Sidcot suit. While he was sometimes very rich in later life, Cotton was also dogged by bad luck in private business. Around the time of the Partition of India in 1947, Cotton was hired by the independent princely state of Hyderabad to assist it in resisting integration into the Dominion of India. At the request of Prince Mohammed Bakhtawar Khan and his son Prince Mumtaz Ali Khan ‚Äì representatives of Osman Ali Khan (Nizam of Hyderabad) ‚Äì Cotton transported gold reserves for the Dominion of Pakistan,Cotton 1969, pp. 223‚Äì248. which was an ally of the Nizam. During the first India-Pakistan War, Cotton undertook airlifts of weapons, supplies and medicines from Hyderabad to Pakistan, using unarmed Avro Lancastrian transport aircraft. Hyderabadi forces were defeated in September 1948 and the Nizam surrendered. Cotton later faced charges of gun running under the UK Air Navigation Act, was convicted and fined ¬£200.\\"AWM Guide to the papers of Frederick Sidney Cotton.\\" awm.gov.au.

Almost nothing is known about his early years, but he seems to have arrived in Vienna during the 1630s, and remained composer and musician at the Habsburg court for the rest of his life. He enjoyed a close relationship with Emperor Leopold I, was ennobled by him, and rose to the rank of Kapellmeister in 1679. He died during a plague epidemic only months after getting the position. Schmelzer was one of the most important violinists of the period, and an important influence on later German and Austrian composers for violin. He made substantial contributions to the development of violin technique and promoted the use and development of sonata and suite forms in Austria and South Germany. He was the leading Austrian composer of his generation, and an influence on Heinrich Ignaz Biber. Biography Vienna in 1609, drawn in 1609 by Jacob Hoefnagel and recolored in 1640 by Claes Jansz Visscher Schmelzer was born in Scheibbs, Lower Austria. Nothing is known about his early years, and most of the surviving information about his background was recounted by the composer himself in his petition for ennoblement of 1673. He described his father as a soldier, but in another document, the 1645 marriage certificate of Schmelzer's sister Eva Rosina, he is listed as a baker. Schmelzer does not mention his father's name, but Eva Rosina's marriage certificate does: Daniel Schmelzer. At any rate, it remains unclear where and from whom Schmelzer received primary music education. His activities before 1643 are similarly unknown‚Äìthe composer is first mentioned in a document dated 28 June 1643, relating to his first marriage. He is referred to as a cornettist at St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansdom), Vienna. The date of his arrival to Vienna is unknown, but he probably worked at the court chapel in the late 1630s, in the employ of Ferdinand II and, after 1637, Ferdinand III. Schmelzer's colleagues at the chapel included such distinguished composers as Johann Jakob Froberger, Giovanni Valentini, and Antonio Bertali. Schmelzer was officially appointed court violinist in 1649. Our knowledge of his position, duties, and activities is incomplete. He apparently rose to prominence as a violin virtuoso, as well as a composer, and enjoyed a close relationship with Emperor Leopold I, who was a well-known patron of the arts and a composer himself. Schmelzer started publishing his music in 1659. He was appointed vice-Kapellmeister on 13 April 1671. On 14 June 1673, after the composer petitioned for ennoblement, the Emperor raised Schmelzer to the ranks of nobility; Schmelzer now added von Ehrenruef to his name. Eventually, after his predecessor Giovanni Felice Sances had died, Schmelzer became Kapellmeister, on 1 October 1679. Unfortunately, he fell victim of the plague early in 1680, and died in Prague, where the Viennese court moved in an attempt to evade the epidemic. Four of his children are known: (26 November 1653 ‚Äì 13 October 1701), a composer; Peter Clemens Schmelzer (28 June 1672 ‚Äì 20 September 1746), a lesser composer; Franz Heinrich Schmelzer (born 27 June 1678), a Jesuit priest; and George Joseph Schmelzer (dates unknown). Music Schmelzer attained a high reputation in a field (violin playing and violin composition) which at the time was dominated by Italians; indeed, one traveler referred to him in 1660 as \\"the famous and nearly most distinguished violinist in all Europe\\".J.J. M√ºller, Reise Diarium, 1660: \\"der ber√ºhmte und wohl ausgezeichnetste Violinist in ganz Europa\\" Schmelzer's Sonatae unarum fidium of 1664 was the first collection of sonatas for violin and basso continuo to be published by a German-speaking composer. It contains the brilliant virtuosity, sectional structure, and lengthy ground- bass variations typical of the mid-Baroque violin sonata. Schmelzer was the foremost Austrian composer of instrumental music of his day, and had an important influence on the Austrian violinist and composer Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber (1644‚Äì1704), who is believed to have been one of Schmelzer's students.

He began to participate in sporting contests in the territory of Varese (the first documented occasion was at Gorla) and later at national and international contests where he outdid his major rival of the time, Louis Ort√®gue of Marseilles. In 1892 he won in the Lecco-Milano; followed by a victory in the Milano-Torino. He became famous very quickly and was one of the foremost marathon runners of his time. His biggest success was the victory in the Milano-Barcellona (September 1895), a competition in 12 legs over a total of 1050 km. This victory brought him 2000 pesetas. The Olympics Airoldi sought to participate in the Athens Olympics of 1896 and he had a good chance of victory. He needed money, however, to get to the Greek capital. He sought money from the director of a well known magazine of the time - \\"La Bicicletta\\", and Airoldi proposed to travel cheaply. He would go on foot through Austria, Turkey and Greece - an adventurous journey that forced him to cover 70 km per day in order to arrive in Athens on time. The magazine was to document all the stages of his journey and help supply him with the necessary information. The magazine accepted and his journey began. The stage from Milan to Split, passing through Trieste and Fiume, met with no problems. Airoldi had intended to pass along the Croatian coast then through Kotor and Corfu. Unfortunately, before arriving at Dubrovnik he fell and hurt his hand and was forced to spend two days in a tent. He was advised against crossing Albania on foot so he boarded an Austrian boat that took him to Patras from where he continued to Athens on foot following the railway lines as there were no roads. After his 28-day journey Airoldi was unfortunately not able to compete in the marathon. He went to the royal palace to sign up for the games where he was questioned by the head of the Olympic Committee. He decided that the money received for winning the Milano-Barcellona competition meant that Airoldi was considered a professional athlete and thus not eligible to compete. Telegrams were sent from Italy but nothing worked: Airoldi was not allowed to participate. There was a strong feeling in Italy that the organizers were not allowing a strong competitor to take part in a race that the Greeks wanted to win. Airoldi never accepted the decision and issued a challenge to Spiridon Louis - the winner of the marathon - that was never taken up. His later years On his return home, Airoldi attempted many times to beat the record of Spiridon Louis without ever succeeding. He continued to race mainly in Lombardy and Switzerland, where he was married and worked (he worked in Berne and Zurich). Finally he moved to South America to seek his fortune.

Biography Leo Lyons, born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire in November 1943, became a professional musician at the age of 16. In 1962, along with band mate Alvin Lee his band The Jaybirds performed at The Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, where Lyons was also hired to play in the club's house band, along with Tony Sheridan. During that time, he also found time to play at the Top Ten Club with featured guitar player Albert Lee. (not to be confused with Alvin Lee) The Jaybirds returned home to England, securing their first recording contract with legendary record producer Joe Meek. From 1963 to 1966, Lyons both played in and managed The Jaybirds. Lyons also found work as a session musician, toured as a sideman with pop acts of the day, appeared in a play in London's West End and played a residency in an exclusive London nightclub with British Jazz Guitarist Denny Wright. In 1967, the Jaybirds changed their name to Ten Years After. The band was given a residency at London's famous Marquee Club and published a debut album on Deram Records. The band soon built up a large following in Europe. After Fillmore West founder Bill Graham heard a copy of the band's first album, he immediately sent a letter offering to book Ten Years After on tour in the United States. As part of Ten Years After, Lyons was one of the first rock performers at the Newport Jazz Festival. In August 1969, the band's encore performance, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going Home‚Äù was captured on film at The Woodstock Music and Arts Festival, exposing their jazz, blues, and rock amalgam to even larger audiences of moviegoers who viewed the concert film. The group toured consistently between 1969 and 1975. Lyons estimates that the band performed for more than 75,000 new fans each week. Lyons subsequently began working in record production, being hired by Chrysalis Records in 1975 as a studio manager for the Wessex Studios in London. Lyons later built two commercial studios of his own. As a producer, Lyons has worked with a number of musical acts, including UFO, Waysted, Mot√∂rhead, Richard and Linda Thompson, and many others. In the 1990s, Lyons released two CDs with his band, Kick. Lyons has also worked as a staff writer for Nashville publishers Hayes Street Music, moving to Nashville from the United Kingdom in 1998. In 2003, Ten Years After reformed and Lyons toured with the group for ten years. In 2010, he formed a side project with TYA guitarist/singer Joe Gooch, called ‚ÄòHundred Seventy Split‚Äô. At the end of 2013, Lyons and Gooch resigned from Years After. Lyons continued releasing albums as part of Hundred Seventy Split. The group is actively touring, and it performs TYA songs along with original material. Lyons is married and has two adult sons. Lyons, as 2019, resides in Cardiff, Wales.

It is arguably the third at a global level. A 2008 survey of 774 catchment areas at the request of the Ministry of Economy and Finance shows that \\"for sporting goods, Decathlon is dominant in 92.8% of zones\\".Distribution : l'enqu√™te secr√®te de Lagarde, Le Nouvel Observateur no. 2275, 12 June 2008 This dominant position has the effect of marginalizing its commercial competitors, including independent retailers.¬´ La d√©ferlante des MDD fa√ßon Decathlon d√©stabilise √©videmment les marques traditionnelles. ¬ª, Gilles Tanguy : Decathlon, le colosse qui √©crase tous ses rivaux, Capital, 3 July 2009 ; ¬´ Cinq cents personnes rassembl√©es jeudi √† Saint-Denis (Seine-Saint-Denis) √† l'appel de la f√©d√©ration textile - habillement - cuir CGT, ont envahi un magasin Decathlon pr√®s du Stade de France pour protester contre les plans de licenciements et les d√©localisations dans le secteur textile, a-t-on appris de sources polici√®re et syndicale. ¬ª, Nouvelobs.com, 06.03.2003.

Otherwise, the company does not have significant competition due to their specific target audience in mass-market retail. Intersport is also a major competitor mainly in European market.

Most wine glasses are stemware, that is they are goblets composed of three parts: the bowl, stem, and foot. Shapes The effect of glass shape on the taste of wine has not been demonstrated decisively by any scientific study and remains a matter of debate. One study suggests that the shape of the glass is important, as it concentrates the flavour and aroma (or bouquet) to emphasize the varietal's characteristic. One common belief is that the shape of the glass directs the wine itself into the best area of the mouth for the varietal despite flavour being perceived by olfaction in the upper nasal cavity, not the mouth. The importance of wine glass shape could also be based on false ideas about the arrangement of different taste buds on the tongue, such as the thoroughly discredited tongue map. Most wine glasses are stemware, that is they are goblets composed of three parts: the bowl, stem, and foot. In some designs, the opening of the glass is narrower than the widest part of the bowl (to concentrate the aroma), others are more conical. In addition, \\"stemless\\" wine glasses (tumblers) are available in a variety of sizes and shapes. The latter are typically used more casually than their traditional counterparts, as they negate the benefits of using stemmed wine glasses. Some common types of wine glasses are described below. =Red wine glasses= right Glasses for red wine are characterized by their rounder, wider bowl, which increases the rate of oxidation. As oxygen from the air chemically interacts with the wine, flavor and aroma are believed to be subtly altered. This process of oxidation is generally considered more compatible with red wines, whose complex flavours are said to be smoothed out after being exposed to air. Red wine glasses can have particular styles of their own, such as * Bordeaux glass: tall with a broad bowl, and is designed for full bodied red wines like Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah as it directs wine to the back of the mouth. * Burgundy glass: broader than the Bordeaux glass, it has a bigger bowl to accumulate aromas of more delicate red wines such as Pinot noir. This style of glass directs wine to the tip of the tongue. =White wine glasses= right White wine glasses vary enormously in size and shape, from the delicately tapered Champagne flute, to the wide and shallow glasses used to drink Chardonnay. Different shaped glasses are used to accentuate the unique characteristics of different styles of wine. Wide- mouthed glasses function similarly to red wine glasses discussed above, promoting rapid oxidation which alters the flavor of the wine. White wines which are best served slightly oxidized are generally full-flavored wines, such as oaked chardonnay. For lighter, fresher styles of white wine, oxidation is less desirable as it is seen to mask the delicate nuances of the wine. To preserve a crisp, clean flavor, many white wine glasses will have a smaller mouth, which reduces surface area and in turn, the rate of oxidization. In the case of sparkling wine, such as Champagne or Asti, an even smaller mouth is used to keep the wine sparkling longer in the glass. =Champagne flutes= Champagne flutes are characterised by a long stem with a tall, narrow bowl on top. The shape is designed to keep sparkling wine desirable during its consumption. Just as with wine glasses, the flute is designed to be held by the stem to help prevent the heat from the hand from warming the liquid inside. The bowl itself is designed in a manner to help retain the signature carbonation in the beverage. This is achieved by reducing the surface area at the opening of the bowl. Additionally, the flute design adds to the aesthetic appeal of champagne, allowing the bubbles to travel further due to the narrow design, giving a more pleasant visual appeal. =Sherry glass= A sherry copita A sherry glass A sherry glass or schooner is drinkware generally used for serving aromatic alcoholic beverages, such as sherry, port, aperitifs, and liqueurs, and layered shooters. The copita, with its aroma-enhancing narrow taper, is a type of sherry glass. =Boccalino= Five Boccalini A boccalino is a mug used in Ticino, Switzerland, to drink local wine (Merlot or similar). It has a volume of approximately 200 ml. Use Some authors recommend one holds the glass by the stem, to avoid warming the wine and smudging the bowl. Materials High quality wine glasses once were made of lead glass, which has a higher index of refraction and is heavier than ordinary glass, but health concerns regarding the ingestion of lead resulted in their being replaced by lead-free glass.Questions and Answers About Lead in Tableware . California Department of Public Health Wine glasses, with the exception of the hock glass, are generally not coloured or frosted as doing so would diminish appreciation of the wine's colour. There used to be an ISO standard (ISO/PAS IWA 8:2009) for glass clarity and freedom from lead and other heavy metals, but it was withdrawn. Some producers of high-end wine glasses such as Schott Zwiesel have pioneered methods of infusing titanium into the glass to increase its durability and reduce the likelihood of the glass breaking. Decoration In the 18th Century, glass makers would draw spiral patterns in the stem as they made the glass. If they used air bubbles it was called an airtwist; if they used threads, either white or coloured, it would be called opaque twist.Clarke, Michael. (2001). The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms. Oxford University Press. ISO wine tasting glass The International Organization for Standardization has a specification (ISO 3591:1977) for a wine-tasting glass. It consists of a cup (an \\"elongated egg\\") supported on a stem resting on a base. INAO official wine tasting glass. The glass of reference is the INAO wine glass, a tool defined by specifications of the French Association for Standardization (AFNOR), which was adopted by INAO as the official glass in 1970, received its standard AFNOR in June 1971 and its ISO 3591 standard in 1972.. The INAO has not submitted a file at the National Institute of Industrial Property, it is therefore copied en masse and has gradually replaced other tasting glasses in the world.Le verre et le vin de la cave √† la table du XVII √† nos jours (Glass and Wine from the Cellar to the Table from the 17th century to the Present) Christophe Bouneau, Michel Figeac, 2007. Centre d'√©tudes des mondes moderne et contemporain. In French. The glass must be lead crystal (9% lead). Its dimensions give it a total volume between 210 mL and 225 mL, they are defined as follows: *Diameter of the rim: 46 mm *Calyx height: 100 mm *Height of the foot: 55 mm *Shoulder diameter: 65 mm *Foot diameter: 9 mm *Diameter of the base: 65 mm The opening is narrower than the convex part so as to concentrate the bouquet. The capacity is approximately 215 ml, but it is intended to take a 50 ml pour. (payment required) Some glasses of a similar shape, but with different capacities, may be loosely referred to as ISO glasses, but they form no part of the ISO specification. Measures in licensed premises In the UK there has been a steady trend away from serving wine in the standard size of 125 ml, towards the larger size of 250 ml, even though, since 1 October 2010, alcohol retailers have been obliged by law to offer customers the choice of a smaller measure. A code of practice, introduced in April 2010 as an extension to the Licensing Act 2003, contains five mandatory conditions for the sale of alcohol, including an obligation for the licensee to make the customer aware that small measures are available. Capacity measure As a supplemental unit of apothecary measure, the wineglass (also known as wineglassful, pl. wineglassesful, or cyathus vinarius in pharmaceutical Latin) was defined as of a pint, or 2 fluid ounces (2 fluid ounces in the imperial system). An older version (before c. 1800) was 1 fluid ounces. These units bear little relation to the capacity of most contemporary wineglasses, or to the ancient Roman cyathus.

It is now part of the Indian Army and specialises in mountain warfare. The 8th was formed as an infantry division in Meerut on 25 October 1940 under Major-General Charles Harvey, a British Indian Army officer, as part of the Indian Army during World War II. It served in the Middle East in the garrisoning of Iraq and then the invasion of Persia to secure the oil fields of the area for the Allies. A brigade was detached to the Western Desert to reinforce the British Eighth Army as it withdrew before the Axis forces. Following training in the Near East, the division entered the Italian Campaign landing at Taranto on mainland Italy. The division was disbanded at the end of World War II but re-formed again in 1962 as a specialist mountain division of the Indian Army. History Despite its relatively late introduction into the mainstream of battle its members won nearly 600 awards and honours including 4 Victoria Crosses, 26 DSOs and 149 MCs.Condon (1962), p.336 During the war the 8th Indian Division sustained casualties totalling 2,012 dead, 8,189 wounded and 749 missing.One More River: The Story of The Eighth Indian Division, pp. 44‚Äì45 =Iraq Syria and Iran= When originally formed the division's main fighting formations were 17th, 18th and 19th Indian Infantry Brigades. On 9 June 1941 17th Brigade arrived in Basra and joined Iraqforce, which had fought the Anglo-Iraqi War to secure the British-owned oilfields during May. These oilfields were perceived to be threatened when a coup d'√©tat brought into power Rashid Ali al-Kaylani who was sympathetic to the Axis powers.Compton Mackenzie, Eastern Epic, p. 83 By the second half of June the brigade had moved to Mosul to defend British-owned oilfields from an anticipated thrust by Axis forces south through the Caucasus. At the end of 1 June 1/12th Frontier Force Regiment and 5/13th Frontier Force Rifles were detached from 17th Brigade to join two battalions from 20th Indian Infantry Brigade (part of 10th Indian Infantry Division) to take part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign and capture the Duck's Bill area in north east Syria and secure the Mosul to Aleppo railway.Compton Mackenzie, Eastern Epic, p. 124 This was achieved without a shot being fired as the Vichy French forces retired westwards. On 17 July Major-General Charles Harvey and the divisional HQ arrived in Basra and had 24th Indian Infantry Brigade (which had arrived on 16 June) assigned to the division. 18th Indian Infantry Brigade arrived in Iraq on 26 July.Compton Mackenzie, pp. 125‚Äì6 The British, having secured first the Iraqi oilfields and then Syria, now focused their concern on Persia (now Iran) where it had been estimated there were some 3,000 German nationals working as technicians, commercial agents and advisors.Compton Mackenzie, Eastern Epic, p. 129 The division first saw shots fired in anger during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in August 1941 when 24th Brigade made a night-time amphibious assault across the Shatt al Arab to capture the oil refinery at Abadan in South Persia. Meanwhile, 18th Brigade had crossed into Persia between Basra and Abadan to take Khorramshahr and became part of a three brigade advance (with Hazelforce) towards Ahwaz, 75 miles north east of Basra. The fighting ended on 28 August when the Shah ordered his forces to cease hostilities.Compton Mackenzie, pp. 130‚Äì139 The 19th Indian Infantry Brigade arrived in Iraq in August, replacing 24th Brigade (which transferred to 6th Indian Infantry Division), and by 17 October, 18th and 19th Brigades had concentrated at Kirkuk in northern Iraq and moved north of the oilfields where they were joined by the 6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers (Watson's Horse) (6th DCO Lancers), the division's reconnaissance regiment. =North Africa= In June 1942 the 18th Brigade, having been rushed over to North Africa from Mosul, and with only two days to prepare defensive positions, was overrun by Erwin Rommel's tanks at Deir el Shein in front of the Ruweisat Ridge. In the process, however, they gained valuable time for the British Eighth Army to organise the defences for what was to be the First Battle of El Alamein, halting Rommel's advance towards Egypt. The brigade was never re- formed. =Iraq and Syria= From August 1942 the division, still a brigade short, became part of Paiforce when Persia and Iraq became a separate command under General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson in Baghdad, (Lieutenant-General Edward Quinan's Tenth Army in Iraq and Persia having previously come under Middle East Command in Cairo). As the threat from the north faded following the Axis defeats at Alamein and Stalingrad the division withdrew in October 1942 to Kifri near Baghdad where it was joined by 21st Indian Infantry Brigade and the 3rd, 52nd and 53rd Field regiments of the Royal Artillery. It spent the winter in intensive training. In January 1943 command of the 8th Indian Division passed to Major-General Dudley Russell (The Pasha), promoted after 15 months commanding the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the excellent \\"Red Eagles\\" 4th Indian Infantry Division. The 8th Indian Division moved in March 1943 to Damascus and continued to spend much of its time training, notably in mountain warfare and combined operations. In June 1943 the division was selected to participate in the anticipated Dodecanese Campaign (\\"Operation Accolade\\"), and seize the Italian-occupied island of Rhodes, the chief Axis stronghold in the Dodecanese Islands. After frantic preparation and having loaded the first wave of ships, the division's participation was canceled when the Italian government surrendered and it was redirected to Italy which the German Army had continued to occupy. =Italy= On 24 September 1943 the 8th Indian Division landed in Taranto, to take its part in the Italian Campaign. The division landed 21 days after the initial invasion, as part of V Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey, serving alongside British 4th Armoured Brigade and the British 78th Infantry Division. For 19 months the division was almost continuously in action, advancing through mountainous country, crossing river after river. The formation later adopted the motto \\"One more river\\". Universal Carrier and mortar team of the 6th Battalion, 13th Frontier Force Rifles, between Lanciano and Osogna on the central sector of the Eighth Army's front, 13 December 1943. From October 1943 to April 1944 the 8th Indian Division was part of the Allied thrust by the British Eighth Army, under General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, up the Adriatic front on the Eastern side of Italy. This involved opposed river crossings of the Biferno, Trigno (October 1943), Sangro (November 1943) and Moro (December 1943). The following three months proved almost as arduous for, although there was no formal offensive, the period was characterised by patrolling and vicious skirmishes in very difficult terrain and abominable winter weather, which proved to be extremely demanding, both physically and mentally, and very stressful. Cassino Men of 'A' Company of the 5th Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment advance along a road past an abandoned German 75mm anti- tank gun in the Rapido bridgehead, Italy, 16 May 1944. When the spring came the 8th Indian Division was switched in great secrecy (along with the bulk of the British Eighth Army, now commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese) 60 miles west across the Apennine Mountains to concentrate as part of Lieutenant-General Sidney C. Kirkmans British XIII Corps, serving alongside the British 4th and 78th Infantry Division, 6th Armoured Divisions, as well as the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, along the River Garigliano at a part of the river better known as the Gari. Their heavily opposed night crossing of the Gari in May 1944, supported by Canadian tanks (1st Canadian Armoured Brigade) with which the division had formed a particularly close fighting relationship over the previous six months, was critical to the Allies' success in this, the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino. Following this, the division advanced some 240 miles in June across mountainous country, fighting many actions against rearguards and defended strongpoints. In late June they had reached Assisi and the division was rested. It was during the fighting on the Gari that Kamal Ram of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Punjab Regiment was awarded his Victoria Cross. At 19 years of age, he was one of the youngest recipients of the VC during the Second World War. Florence and the Gothic Line King George VI is driven past cheering Indian troops on his way to a ceremony to invest Sepoy Kamal Ram with the Victoria Cross, Italy, 26 July 1944. By the end of July 1944, after a few weeks out of the line, the 8th Indian Division was back in the line with 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade in front of Florence pushing towards the River Arno. Florence was occupied by the 21st Indian Infantry Brigade on 12 August where they had the unusual task to recover some of the world's greatest art treasures and arrange safe custody. By mid- September the division was in the mountains again, breaking through the Gothic Line and then spending two months of grim (and ultimately unsuccessful) battling in foul weather towards the plains of Northern Italy, together with the British 1st Infantry, 78th Infantry and 6th Armoured Divisions, alongside the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, forming British XIII Corps. XIII Corps had now become the right wing of the U.S. Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. It was during this time that Thaman Gurung of the 1st Battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles was awarded the Victoria Cross. In December 1944 the 2nd New Zealand Division, advancing from the Adriatic on the division's right along the Romagna plain, took Faenza and the resistance on the 8th Indian Division's front weakened as the Germans withdrew to shorten their front. In late December 1944, 19th and 21st Brigades were rapidly switched across the Apennines to reinforce the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division on the Fifth Army's left flank in front of Lucca. By the time they had arrived the Germans had broken through but decisive action by Major-General Russell halted their advance and the situation was stabilised by the New Year. The 8th Indian Division then moved to Pisa for a period of rest. Spring offensive 1945 In mid-February 1945 the division was back in the line on the Adriatic front, this time as part of British Eighth Army's V Corps, in front of the River Senio. The main assault on the Senio started on 9 April. In desperate fighting two members of the division, Namdeo Jadav and Ali Haidar, were awarded the Victoria Cross. By 11 April the division reached and crossed the River Santerno breaking open a hole in the German line for the British 78th Division and elements of British 56th Division to engage the enemy and defeat them in the Argenta Gap. This opened the way to Ferrara and the Po River and for the British 6th Armoured Division to pass through, veer left and race westward across country to link with the advancing U.S. Fifth Army, now commanded by Lucian Truscott, and complete the encirclement of the divisions of the German 10th and 14th Armies defending Bologna. In the aftermath of the Argenta fighting, the 8th Indian Division drove on rapidly through to Ferrara and across the Po and shortly thereafter to their last river crossing of the war, the Adige. The campaign ended on 2 May 1945. The 6th DCO Lancers marked the occasion with a special mission, sending an officer and nine men far up the road towards Austria and arranged the surrender of 11,000 men of their old enemy, the German 1st Parachute Division. =Post World War II= Re-raised in 1962, the division differs from more conventional infantry divisions in the emphasis that is placed on infantry tactics and the limited role that armour can be expected to take in operations in mountainous terrain. The armour that is used may differ from that used by other infantry divisions, for example, specialised mountain guns are required in many areas where the division might be expected to operate. The division has been constantly involved in operations since its creation. It was initially created for operations against insurgents fighting for a separate state of Nagaland. In the mid-1990s, the formation was moved to the Kashmir valley in response to conflict there. During the early summer of 1999, the division was moved north to the Kargil District to augment the beleaguered 3rd Infantry Division, which was based in Leh, during Operation Vijay II. It is now permanently based in that sector as part of XIV Corps. The 8th was shifted 1 June 1999 to XV Corps for the Kargil conflict, taking over vacant positions formerly held by 28th Mountain Division.Renaldi and Rikhye, 2011, 41 It controlled the 50th Parachute Brigade; its own 56th, 79th and 192nd Mountain Brigades; and the 121st (Independent) Infantry Brigade. The shift to Kashmir became permanent after 1999, with the division placed under the new XIV Corps. It now includes 56th Mountain Brigade, which itself during the Kargil War of 1999 included 1st Battalion, the Naga Regiment.Renaldi and Rikhye, 2011, 107  Formation During World War II  General Officer Commanding: *Major-General Charles Harvey (Oct 1940 ‚Äì Dec 1942) *Major-General Dudley Russell (Jan 1943 ‚Äì Aug 1945) *Brigadier T.

During the period of the British Raj, the city was the capital of Dhrangadhra State, one of the eight first-class princely states (13-gun salute) of the Kathiawar Agency in the Bombay Presidency. Etymology In Sanskrit dhrang means a stone, and dhara means the earth. It is believed that because of the strong and widespread yellow stone bedrock found immediately under the soil of the place, the town is thus named. History Coat of Arms of Dhrangadhra state Portrait of H.H. Man Singh, Raja of Dhrangadhra (1837-1900) Dhrangadhra has a long history starting from Lower Paleolithic Period. The River named Falku is passing from Dhrangadhra town. The evidence come from the river bed of the Bhadar river which flows along with the Dhragadhra taluka. Moreover, there are many Harappan-period sites. Recent studies in the area suggests that the Dhragadhra and Halvad taluka was the frontier of the so-called sorat Harappans which bifurcates the Sidhi Harrapans of Kutch &andSindh.; These are recent studies made by Arun Malik, a PhD scholar of The M.S. University of Baroda and now he is with Archaeological Survey of India. =Modern history= Dhrangadhra grew from Jhalawad Princely State, which was founded about AD 1090. This state was ruled by the Jhala Rajputs. In 1735, Dhrangadhra was founded as its capital. The state was then renamed Dhrangadhra-Halvad state from the initial name of Kuwa, Halwad. In 1941 the princely state of Dhrangadhra had a population of 94,417 living in an area of 1,167 square miles.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer. p. 511 In 1925, India's first soda ash factory was founded in Dhrangadhra. It was taken over by Shreyans Prasad Jain, who established the Dhrangadhra Chemical Works (now known as DCW) in 1939. Now, DCW is the largest industry there, and is the main source of employment. In 1948, the state of Dhrangadhra was made part of the Jhalawad district in Saurashtra. In 1956 it became part of Gujarat.

It is endemic to southern peninsular India. They are found on scrub habitats on steep, rocky hills many of which are threatened by granite quarrying. It is confusable only with the white- browed bulbul with which its range overlaps but is distinctively yellow on the head and throat apart from the yellow vent. The calls of this species are very similar to that of the white-browed bulbul. Taxonomy and systematics The yellow-throated bulbul was originally described by Thomas Jerdon in the genus Brachypus (a synonym for Pycnonotus), and later re-classified it in the genus Ixos. It has since been re-classified to the genus Pycnonotus. The alternate name yellow-eared bulbul should not be confused with the species of that name, Pycnonotus penicillatus. The name 'yellow-throated bulbul' is also used as an alternate name for Falkenstein's greenbul. Description This uncrested species of bulbul is olive grey above with a yellow throat, undertail coverts and tail tips. The head is plain while the breast and belly have a grey wash. The closest resembling species is the white-browed bulbul but this has a supercilium and lacks the yellow throat. Males and females are similar in plumage. Distribution and habitat The habitat of the species is rocky, scrub covered hills mostly in the Eastern Ghats and central peninsular India but also in some places in the Western Ghats. The distribution is highly fragmented and populations are very local, making hilly habitats a very special conservation concern. Many of these hill forests are threatened by granite quarrying, forest fires and grazing. It has vanished from many sites where it was earlier known. Some well known locations include the Nandi Hills, Horsley Hills, Gingee, Yercaud and the Biligirirangans. The species is also seen in some parts of the Western Ghats including the Anamalais. The northern limit is believed to be in the Nallamala range but it is suspected that the species may extend in range into the northern Eastern Ghats of Orissa. Behaviour and ecology This bird is usually shy and hidden within scrub and is usually detected by its sudden cackling outbursts of calls which are similar to those of the white-browed bulbul. They feed on insects and the berries of various scrub plant species including Lantana camara, Flueggea leucopyrus, Toddalia asiatica, Erythroxylon monogynum, Solanum indicum, Santalum album, Ziziphus, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus nervosa, Ficus montana, Canthium dicoccum and Phyllanthus reticulata. 1847 illustration During hot afternoons and in the dry-season they visit pools of water both to drink and bathe. The breeding season is June to August. The nest is built in the fork of small tree. Two eggs are laid which hatch in 20 days with the chicks fledging 13 days later.

His challenge was to build a nation out of a vast and diverse territory that had poor communications, few known resources, a tiny market, and a collection of impoverished people with sharply differing political traditions, ethnic and regional loyalties, and sociocultural patterns. The French colonial powers that had created the country's boundaries had done little to promote economic interdependence, political cooperation, or crosscultural understanding. Chadians who had hoped that the country's first president might turn out to be a state builder like the 13th century's Dabbalemi or the 16th century's Aluma were soon disappointed. During its first fifteen years, Chad under Tombalbaye experienced worsening economic conditions, eventual alienation of the most patient of foreign allies, exacerbation of ethnic and regional conflict, and grave weakening of the state as an instrument of governance. Tombalbaye's Governance At the outset, Tombalbaye demonstrated an autocratic style along with a distrust of the institutions of democracy. One week before the country gained independence, Tombalbaye purged Gabriel Lisette from his own party, the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), declared Lisette a noncitizen while he was traveling abroad, and barred him from returning to Chad. This \\"coup by telegram\\" was the first in an extensive series of Tombalbaye's increasingly authoritarian actions to eliminate or neutralize his opponents. To increase his power and freedom of action, Tombalbaye declared a ban on all political parties except the PPT in January 1962, and, in April, he established a presidential form of government. When serious rioting occurred in 1963 in N'Djamena and Am Timan, the government declared a state of emergency and dissolved the National Assembly. And, as part of a major campaign against real and imagined political opponents, Tombalbaye created a special criminal court. By the end of the year, the country's prisons contained a virtual \\"who's who\\" of Chadian politicians. In June 1964, a new National Assembly granted Tombalbaye complete control over all appointments to the Political Bureau of the PPT, which by then was the sole source of political authority. With the PPT, government, and upper echelons of the civil service stocked with loyalists, and with opposition leaders in prison, exile, or completely co-opted, Tombalbaye was in full command of the country. An effort to Africanize the civil service and security forces as rapidly as possible complemented Tombalbaye's drive for personal power. Between 1960 and 1963, the number of French officials in the central government administration declined from ninety-five to thirty (although the total number of French personnel increased as technical advisers were hired for development programs), and by the end of 1962 the entire territorial administrative structure was in Chadian hands. In addition, units of the Chad's national army replaced French military forces in Borkou-Ennedi- Tibesti Prefecture and in Ab√©ch√©, a process formally completed on January 23, 1965. Africanization was not entirely popular among Chad's farmers and herders, despite their deep resentment of French colonial rule. A decline in the quality of government service was immediately apparent, in part because of the usual difficulties of transition, but also because many of the newly hired and promoted Chadians were less experienced and less adequately trained than their departing French counterparts. Increasing the discontent, Tombalbaye imposed an additional tax in 1964, under the euphemism of a \\"national loan.\\" On top of that action, some government administrators were allegedly forcing citizens in rural areas to make payments at three times the official taxation rates. Reports of corruption and other abuses of authority grew as Chad's new officials became aware of both the increased pressures and the decreased constraints on public servants. Because the great majority of the country's Western-educated and French-speaking citizens were southerners, the policy of Africanization often represented a \\"southernization\\" of the Chadian government. What appeared to some Western observers to be progress in African self-government was perceived by those from the northern and central areas to be an increasingly blatant seizure of power by southerners. To many in northern and central Chad, the southern Chadians were simply another set of foreigners, almost as alien and arrogant as the departing French. Tombalbaye's failure to establish hiring and training policies geared to achieving greater ethnic and regional balance in public administration was one of his most serious shortcomings. Another was his lack of success - or lack of interest - in reaching power-sharing agreements with key leaders in the Saharan and sahelian regions. Dissatisfaction with these failures was expressed violently, and the government response was just as violent. When young Muslims rioted in N'Djamena on 16 September 1963 following the arbitrary arrests of three Muslim leaders, the government reacted swiftly and repressively, using the army for the repression; as a result, more than 300 people were killed. A little more than a year later, an altercation at a public dance in the northern town of Barda√Ø prompted a Sara deputy prefect to order the inhabitants of an entire village to march to prison, where many were stripped and all were insulted. Many were arbitrarily fined for such offenses as wearing beards or turbans. Included among the targets of abuse was Oueddei Kichidemi, the derde, or spiritual head, of the Teda people, a Toubou group. Explosive confrontations such as this occurred repeatedly as the inexperienced southerners, who understood little and cared less for the customs of the peoples they governed, replaced experienced French administrators. By this time, just five years after independence, the possibility of armed conflict was growing. Politicians throughout Chad increasingly used traditional loyalties and enmities to decry opposition and solidify popular support for their positions. In view of Chad's historical legacy of conflict, some historians have argued that even the most competent leader with the most enlightened set of policies would have eventually faced secessionist movements or armed opposition. Tombalbaye, however, hastened the onset of civil conflict by quickly squandering his legitimacy through repressive tactics and regional favoritism. Rebellion in Chad On November 1, 1965, frustration with what was perceived as government mismanagement and tax collection abuses erupted in riots in the town of Mangalm√© in Gu√©ra Prefecture. Five hundred persons died, including the local deputy to the National Assembly and nine other government officials. From Mangalm√© and nearby Batha Prefecture, the rebellion spread to Ouadda√Ø and Salamat prefectures, where in February 1967 the prefect and deputy prefect were killed. In August 1968, a major mutiny in Aozou among the Toubou units of the Nomad and National Guard highlighted the continuing unrest in the north. In the same year, antigovernment activities and tracts began to appear in Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture, only about 100 kilometers from N'Djamena. Travel became unsafe in much of central Chad, and governmental authority in the north was reduced by 1969 to the garrison towns of Faya-Largeau, Fada, Barda√Ø, and Ounianga K√©bir. In addition to historical causes and what Tombalbaye himself was later to call \\"maladministration\\", the country's Arabic speaking neighbors abetted rebellion in the northern and central regions of Chad. In Sudan and Libya, numerous self-styled \\"liberation fronts\\" appeared in the mid-1960s, printing manifestos and claiming leadership over rebellious groups inside Chad. The most prominent of these fronts, the National Liberation Front of Chad (Front de Lib√©ration Nationale du Tchad or FROLINAT), was formed in June 1966 in Nyala in southwestern Sudan. Personality, philosophical, and ethnic differences soon led to the front's fragmentation, with one group moving to Khartoum and another, which retained the FROLINAT designation, establishing offices in Algiers and Tripoli. The influence of external assistance to the rebels during this period was minimal. Prior to 1976, Chad's uprisings were disorganized and uncoordinated among dissident groups. Most observers attribute the rebels' success more to the ineptitude of Chad's government and national army than to outside assistance. After FROLINAT's eastern region field commander, Ibrahim Abatcha, died in combat in February 1968, four contenders for leadership emerged. Within two years, two of them reportedly had been assassinated and one had fled to Sudan; the fourth, Abba Siddick, became FROLINAT's new secretary general in 1970. But in 1971, when Siddick called for greater cooperation among various groups under the FROLINAT banner, he encountered vigorous opposition in the north from Goukouni Oueddei, son of Oueddei Kichidemi, and Hiss√®ne Habr√©, leaders of the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (Conseil de Commandement de Forces Arme√©s du Nord or CCFAN). Goukouni and Habr√© broke with Siddick, who managed to retain only nominal control over FROLINAT's First Liberation Army in east-central Chad. Tombalbaye's initial response to the increasing antigovernment activities was to attempt to crush them. When the government's forces proved woefully inadequate for the task, Tombalbaye swallowed his pride and called in the French under provisions of military treaties signed in 1960. Confronted by the unpopularity of such a step, the French government joined many Chadian intellectuals in calling for a broad range of economic and political reforms by Chad's government. Desperate for French assistance, Tombalbaye reluctantly accepted the thirty-three member Administrative Reform Mission (Mission de R√©forme Administrative or MRA), which arrived in 1969 with authority to retrain the army, reorganize the civil service, and recommend the abolition of unpopular laws and taxes. The most significant political reform was the full restoration to Chad's major sultans of their previous judicial authority. The government also allowed them to resume their function as tax collectors in exchange for 10% of the revenue. This action, which Tombalbaye implemented grudgingly, temporarily undermined rebel activities across central Chad. Liberalization continued in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Following the 1969 presidential elections, in which Tombalbaye ran unopposed, some 600 political prisoners were released, including a number of prominent Muslims. In April 1971, Tombalbaye, addressing the Seventh Congress of the PPT, admitted for the first time that he had made mistakes and that there were some shortcomings associated with his policies. He promised a campaign of national reconciliation, and a few weeks later he formed a government that included a greater proportion of Muslims and northerners. In June Tombalbaye freed another 1,500 political prisoners and toured rebel regions in the north, where he promised, among other things, government-subsidized salt and sugar for the nomads of Zouar and Barda√Ø. These reforms and French assistance contributed to the relative calm of 1970 and 1971. French military forces provided extensive and effective assistance in containing rebellious activities in central Chad. By June 1971, overt rebellion had been reduced for the most part to isolated pockets in the Tibesti region. The French government, under domestic pressure, began to withdraw its forces from Chad. Fall of the regime Tombalbaye's reform efforts ceased abruptly in August 1971. In that month, he claimed to have quashed a coup involving some recently amnestied Chadians who allegedly received support from Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. Tomabalbaye severed relations with Libya and invited anti-Qaddafi elements to establish bases in Chad. In retaliation, Qaddafi recognized FROLINAT, offered (for the first time formally) an operational base in Tripoli to Siddick, and increased the flow of supplies to the Chadian rebels. Domestic calm deteriorated further when students conducted a strike in N'Djamena in November 1971. Although easily contained, the strike demonstrated the growing politicization and disaffection of young members of the southern elite and reflected their increased awareness of the army's political potential. Tombalbaye then replaced the chief of staff, General Jacques Doumro, who was a favorite of the students, with Colonel F√©lix Malloum. In June 1972, a band of Libyan-trained saboteurs was captured while attempting to smuggle guns and explosives into the capital. These arrests coincided with a serious financial crisis, a worsening drought, bitter government infighting, and civil unrest in the capital. These events convinced Tombalbaye to abandon his policy of national reconciliation. He incarcerated more than 1,000 real or suspected \\"enemies of the state\\". In an indication of his growing distrust of the previously secure south, Tombalbaye detained hundreds of southerners and removed two key southern cabinet ministers. He also effected a dramatic diplomatic aboutface designed to obtain economic assistance from the Arab world while undermining FROLINAT. To enhance ties to the Arab world, Tombalbaye broke Chad's relations with Israel in September 1972. A few months later, Tombalbaye secured an initial pledge of 23 billion CFA Francs from Libya. In 1973 other Arab capitals promised aid. In addition, Chad withdrew from the Afro-Malagasy and Mauritian Common Organization (Organisation Commune Africaine, Malgache, et Mauricienne or OCAMM), a moderate alliance of French-speaking African states. Tombalbaye's strategy to create difficulties for FROLINAT was successful. When Qaddafi began restricting deliveries of military supplies and food to the rebels, fighting for the limited supplies erupted between FROLINAT's First Liberation Army and FAN (at that time also called the Second Liberation Army). The Second Liberation Army lost control of Ennedi and retreated into northern Borkou and Tibesti. In April 1974, however, it struck back by seizing three European hostages, including a French archaeologist at Barda√Ø. By this time, the Tombalbaye presidency was rapidly unraveling, as greater attention focused on the real and suspected threats from within the government. In June 1973, Tombalbaye arrested Malloum, the head of the women's wing of the PPT, and a score of other party officials, mostly from the south. These individuals were held on charges of \\"political sorcery\\" in what came to be known as the \\"Black Sheep Plot\\" because of their alleged involvement in animal sacrifices. Moreover, when Outel Bono, a widely admired liberal politician, was assassinated in Paris while organizing a new political party in August, many believed that Tombalbaye's government was behind the murder. Also that month, Tombalbaye decided to replace the PPT with a new party, the National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution (Mouvement National pour la R√©volution Culturelle et Sociale or MNRCS). To deflect domestic criticism, Tombalbaye embarked on a campaign to promote authenticit√©, or \\"Chaditude.\\" This effort was aimed at expunging foreign practices and influences. To shore up his support from Chad's expanding urban elite, Tombalbaye Africanized the names of several places (Fort-Lamy and Fort Archambault became N'Djamena and Sarh, respectively) and ordered civil servants to use indigenous names in place of their European ones; he changed his first name to Ngarta. In addition, his policies induced many foreign missionaries to repatriate. His strident attacks on the French government were also popular. Tombalbaye lashed out specifically at Jacques Foccart, the powerful secretary general to the French Presidency for African Affairs, who was labeled an \\"evil genius\\" and formally condemned in a National Assembly resolution as the source of some \\"fourteen plots\\" against the government of Chad. To restore his sagging support among Sara traditionalists in the rural south, Tombalbaye came out in favor of the harsh physical and psychological yondo initiation rites for all southern males between sixteen and fifty, making them compulsory for any non-Muslim seeking admission to the civil service, government, and higher ranks of the military. From mid-1973 to April 1974, an estimated 3,000 southern civil servants, including two cabinet ministers and one colonel, went through the yondo ordeal. Because the rites were perceived as anti-Christian and essentially borrowed from one Sara subgroup, resistance to the process exacerbated antagonisms along clan and religious lines. Therefore, rather than encouraging greater southern support, Tombalbaye's action created disaffection among civil servants, army officers, and students. The worsening drought in the early 1970s also affected Chad's degenerating political situation. Throughout 1974 international criticism of Chad's handling of drought-relief efforts reached a new peak, as government insensitivity and overt profiteering became obvious. In response to its economic crisis, the government launched Operation Agriculture, which involved a massive volunteer cotton planting effort on virgin lands. The project increased production somewhat, but at the expense of major economic dislocations and greater southern resentment, particularly from people in cities and towns who were rounded up by the military to \\"volunteer\\" for agricultural labor. By early 1975, many observers believed that Tombalbaye had eroded his two main bases of support - the south and the armed forces. Only intra-Sara divisions and concern over the possible loss of southern influence in government had prevented any well-organized anti-Tombalbaye movement. In addition, throughout the early 1970s Tombalbaye's criticism of the army's mediocre performance in the field had angered the officer corps and dissipated its loyalty. Other military grievances included frequent purges and reshufflings of the top ranks. In March 1975, Tombalbaye ordered the arrest of several senior military officers, as suspects in yet another plot. On April 13, 1975, several units of N'Djamena's gendarmerie, acting under the initial direction of junior military officers, killed Tombalbaye during a coup.

The 1889 Declaration of Utrecht is one of three founding documents together called the Convention of Utrecht. The is in full communion with the Anglican Communion through the 1931 Bonn Agreement; and, with the Philippine Independent Church, the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church, and the Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church through a 1965 extension of the Bonn Agreement. the includes six member churches: the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (OKKN), the Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany, the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, the Old Catholic Church of Austria, the Old Catholic Church of the Czech Republic, and the Polish Catholic Church in Poland. Theology and practices The Old Catholic churches reject the universal jurisdiction of the pope, as well as the Roman Catholic dogma of papal infallibility (1870), which was used to proclaim the Roman Catholic dogmas of the Assumption of Mary (1950). While Old Catholics affirm the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, they do not emphasize transubstantiation as the sole dogmatic explanation for this presence. Old Catholics generally refrain from using the ' and ' clauses in the Nicene Creed and also reject a dogmatic understanding of Purgatory; however, they generally do recognize a purification by Christ's grace after death and include prayers for the dead in their liturgy and devotions. They maintain such basic western Catholic practices as baptism by affusion (pouring of water) and the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist. Additionally, they have many aspects in common with the Orthodox and Anglican churches, such as optional clerical celibacy. Leadership Individual member churches maintain a degree of autonomy, similar to the practice of the Anglican Communion. Each diocese of member churches has a diocesan bishop, and countries with more than one diocese have a bishop who is appointed as \\"bishop in charge\\" or a similar title. The primate (' leader) of the is the Archbishop of Utrecht (not to be confused with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht). The current primate , is Joris Vercammen, a former Roman Catholic who serves on the central committee of the World Council of Churches.. In 2020, Joris Vercammen was succeeded by Bernd Wallet. History The mother church, the , was established in the 18th century as a result of tensions between the local Catholic hierarchy and the Roman Curia. The other churches, such as the Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany, and the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, followed suit after the First Vatican Council, which defined the dogma of papal infallibility. Former member churches In former Yugoslavia, had three organized old-catholic episcopal jurisdictions: Old Catholic Church of Croatia (created in 1922-1923, first bishop Marko Kalojera consecrated in 1924 in Utrecht),Hrvatska starokatoliƒçka crkva: Na≈°a povijest Old Catholic Church of Slovenia (with bishops Radovan Jo≈°t and Anton Kovaƒçeviƒç), and Old Catholic Church of Serbia (with bishop Milan Dobrovoljac (1954-1966). Three churches formed \\"Union of Old-Catholic Churches in Yugoslavia\\" (1954). The Union eventually ceased to exist with break-up of Yugoslavia (1991-1992) and even before that, old-catholic bishopric in Serbia was extinguished, and same happened with bishoprics in Slovenia and Croatia. Finally, remaining old- catholic parishes in Croatia and other parts of former Yugoslavia were placed under jurisdiction of the Old Catholic Church of Austria.The Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches: Member Churches The stated in 1997 that the Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC) was not full communion with other member churches because the did not accept the ordination of women.

Biography Freddy Monnickendam came into contact with comics when he negotiated the rights to The Smurfs for Father Abraham. Afterwards, he became the head of SEPP International S.A. (SEPP stands for \\"La Soci√©t√© d'Edition, de Presse et de Publicit√©\\"), the company branch of Dupuis (the editor of The Smurfs) that was responsible for the merchandising of the comic heroes. He negotiated the contract between Dupuis, Peyo, NBC and Hanna- Barbera, for the creation of a series of Smurf cartoons, and became the first executive producer of the series. Peyo wanted the Smurf cartoons to be as faithful as possible to the world he had created in his comics, but Monnickendam preferred to make the cartoons more accessible, and more mainstream. This led to the fast deterioration of relations between the two men, ending in court cases about the division of the rights and the money involved. Annoyed by these discussions and problems, he decided to start a new series of cartoons called Snorks, which were created and designed by Nicolas Broca. Monnickendam later acquired all the rights, hoping to equal the success of The Smurfs, but the success of the Snorks was limited and the series soon ended production. Having bypassed Dupuis, the collaboration between the publisher and Monnickendam ended, and as a result, SEPP International S.A. was disbanded. Monnickendam continued to work with Hanna-Barbera on such shows as Foofur (created by Phil Mendez), The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley (based on the Martin Short character), and other shows (including Tom and Jerry Kids), but he was never able to replicate the success he had with The Smurfs.

He had a start in many local singing shows and showcase forums in and about Trinidad. During his career, he travelled around the world giving lectures and shows at many music institutions and universities, and was one of the first artists to bring the music of Trinidad and Tobago to the rest of the world. Layne took many trips to Africa, after studying African history. A 1998 United Nations Radio programme described the links between calypso and highlife music, focusing on an exchange of visits between Layne and high life musician Koo Nimo of Ghana. In later years, Layne joined the Orisa faith. He had twin daughters, Niasha and Anuska, who are accomplished pannists. He is often described as being the founder of rapso; his 1970 song \\"Blow Away\\" was the first rapso recording, although the term was not coined until 1980. Many of his most remembered songs were not recorded, including the song \\"Strike Squad\\", which he composed for his local football team. \\"Get Off The Radio\\" was a protest song about the imbalance of radio airplay between local and foreign works.

It features a great variety of characters from a myriad parallel universes (including \\"our\\" Earth universe). All universes spiral out on a continuum, which are more closely related to one end, Amber (and its history and functions), or slides on a scale closer and closer to Amber's opposite, the Courts of Chaos, at the other. Amberites Characters from Amber are referred to as Amberites. =The Amber royal family= Much information about the royal family is compiled only in the authorized companion book Roger Zelazny's Visual Guide to Castle Amber. Some personal colors and offspring are identified only there. The founder of the family is Dworkin Barimen, who first appears as a mad sorcerer. He is the creator of the Primal Pattern and father of Oberon. The surname Barimen is an anagram of \\"in Amber\\" and may or may not have been intended as the name of a House of Chaos; it also suspiciously similar to the name ‚ÄúShambarimen‚Äù, the maker of a major artifact in Philip Jose Farmer's World of Tiers series and is likely a voluntary tip of the hat to him. Dworkin‚Äôs children and grandchildren are: * Oberon, liege lord of Amber and only known child of Dworkin (by the Unicorn?). His children are: * by Cymnea: ** Benedict (orange, yellow, brown), The master tactician of the family as well as the unmatched master of all martial weapons, and a man who seldom smiles. He chose to remove himself from the struggle for the crown, leaving Eric and Corwin as the eldest surviving heirs. Moreover, Oberon declared his marriage with Cymnea null and void, rendering all his children by her retroactively illegitimate. Benedict has had an affair with Lintra the Hellmaid of Chaos, during a brief interlude in hostilities between them, and is unaware that she bore a child as a result of this. Benedict and Lintra subsequently came to blows again, and Benedict slew Lintra but lost his arm. He still fights better with one arm than anybody else with two. *** Dara, great-granddaughter of Benedict after his affair with Lintra. Because of the differing speed of time-flow in different Shadows and between Amber and Chaos, she is first met as a fairly young woman: But within only a couple of weeks of Amber time, she has grown considerably older and embittered in Chaos, to herself be a mother of at least three fully adult children. ** Osric (silver & red) and Finndo (green & gold), long-dead brothers of whom we learn little. It is suggested that they conspired to take the throne from their father, after which they were sent to the front lines of a war from which they did not return. * by Faiella: ** Eric (black & red), Corwin's elder full-brother (illegitimate because Oberon & Faiella were not married at the time of his birth). An arrogant yet competent would-be king of Amber; he commands the loyalty of Julian, Caine, and G√©rard. Corwin and Eric's rivalry for the throne drives much of the plot of the first two books. After Benedict, Eric was reputedly the greatest swordsman in the Universe of Amber and Shadow. A few centuries before the events of the first novels, he and Corwin decided to settle their rivalry in a duel to the death. In the event, Eric, fearing Oberon's wrath, left Corwin, gravely injured, on Earth in the 17th century. Corwin recovered physically but his memory was gone. Eric maintained that Corwin had left Amber of his own volition, but Oberon would often hint that he suspected Eric of killing Corwin. When Oberon disappeared, he was lured into Shadow in order to find a tool to fix the Pattern after Brand damaged it. Eric soon allied with Caine and Julian to hold the throne. ** Corwin of Amber (silver & black), the narrator of the first five books. He is the first legitimate living child of Oberon who desires the throne. His years on Earth seem to have softened him somewhat from his earlier arrogant beliefs, particularly with respect to the rest of the family, and to the residents of Shadow, who are regarded by some in the family as creations of their own minds, to be used and abused as they see fit. He also improved his political skills and his swordsmanship to the point where he fights Eric to a draw in Nine Princes in Amber. *** Merlin of Amber (purple and grey), son of Corwin and Dara following a brief mid-afternoon fling. The narrator of the second set of five books. He was raised in the Courts of Chaos, and Corwin is unaware of his son's existence until he is informed by Dara late in the series. Adopting Earth, home to Flora and to his father, as his own home, he becomes a software developer in San Francisco. He finds himself subject to attempts on his life, which turn out to be instigated by his friend Luke, who is really Brand's son Rinaldo. He also has two younger half-brothers, Despil and Jurt, on his mother's side (from her second husband, Lord Gramble Sawall of Chaos), and an older step-halfbrother, Mandor, from Gramble's own prior marriage. ** Deirdre (silver & black), Corwin's sister. Corwin's feelings for Deirdre are decidedly un-brotherly, and she appears to return his affection. She is a minor character in the Corwin cycle, but the Visual Guide to Amber says that she was the best-loved of the royals, due to her beauty and compassion. She dresses in black plate armor and used an axe in battle. Her mother was Faiella, who died while bearing Deirdre. * by Clarissa, known as \\"the redheads\\": ** Fiona (green, lavender, purple), a deft mind and stunning beauty. Sorceress of the family. With Bleys, she was one of the original co- conspirators with Brand to unseat Oberon and take the throne. Corwin initially does not like her, but they become closer during the events of the series. Later she befriends her nephew Merlin and helps him solve his own mysteries. ** Bleys (red & orange), a dashing and charming extrovert who partners with Corwin in the effort to retake Amber from Eric. He is also a sorcerer, though of lesser skill than his two full siblings, and favors the sword. ** Brand (green), a manic depressive megalomaniac sorcerer. He makes Faustian bargains with the forces of Chaos in order to gain power, apparently becoming a \\"living Trump\\" who can move anywhere in Shadow by willing it. By the time of the final conflict at the Courts of Chaos, he is no longer quite human, even by Amberite standards, and is quite insane. *** Rinaldo, also known as Luke, son of Brand and Jasra. He and Merlin both studied at Berkeley and then worked with a computer company Grand Design. Luke does not tell much about himself, but shows he is strong, intelligent and has a salesman's ability to convince people and make them do things he wants. Luke plots revenge against the Royal Family, especially Merlin and Caine, for his father's death. After Caine's death, he is persuaded to give up the vendetta. He appears to prefer his own chosen alias of Luke to his given name of Rinaldo, even to people who know his birth name. * by Lady Moins of Rebma: ** Llewella (green, lavender, gray), was born of an affair Oberon had with Moins. She is older than Brand and younger than Bleys: Technically illegitimate, she was legally adopted to spite Clarissa after their final divorce. Llewella removed herself from the presence of her family, and lives in Rebma, an underwater city that is a reflection of Amber. Hers is something of a sad existence. She stands with her half-siblings in the final confrontation at the Courts of Chaos. * by Harla: ** None known * by Rilga: ** Caine (black & green), a calculating, realistic manipulator with naval talents and lifestyle. He and G√©rard command both the Amber Navy and the merchant fleets which ply a thousand different Shadow oceans in their trade. Caine seemed to give Corwin the sea passage to Amber on his first assault, but then ambushed him with help from Eric, who was controlling the weather. After Eric's death and Corwin's assumption of power, Caine faked his own death in order to \\"go underground\\" in finding the author of the threat to Amber among the Royal Family. He arranged for Corwin to discover his \\"body\\", actually that of one of his shadows, and later stabbed Corwin after it appeared to him that Corwin, by bringing back Brand, was attempting to revive the plot against Oberon. Caine reappeared in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos, his silver arrows killing Brand. In the second set of novels, he himself is killed by Luke/Rinaldo as revenge for Brand's death. This results in Julian and G√©rard declaring a vendetta against Luke. ** Julian (white & black), a cold, sinister hunter with a calm manner and biting tongue. He is usually found guarding the Forest of Arden in Amber, with his hell-hounds - beasts out of Shadow who are quite capable of ripping bodies, and metal, with their teeth. He has incestuous feelings for Fiona. Eventually he admits to Corwin that he recommended that Corwin be blinded in captivity, to render him useless to Brand's cabal (and thus in a way saving his life). With Eric and Caine, Julian formed the counter-cabal to hold the throne. ** G√©rard (blue & gray), a trusted brother, the strongest man in the multiverse and called \\"the best of all of us\\" by Brand. His loyalty is not, however, backed up with intelligence. He resents being manipulated by his siblings, preferring the face-to-face confrontation and the contest of strength, not of guile. When the family contacts Brand in his shadow prison, G√©rard is the first to grab an axe, teleport into Brand's cell, and free him. Later he loyally guards Brand after he is mysteriously stabbed after returning to Amber. * by Dybele ** Florimel (green & gray), known as Flora, is regarded as shallow or a dumb blonde by her siblings, yet she often is on the winning side. Her beauty is legendary in many Shadows and also in Amber itself. She was placed on Earth to keep an eye on Corwin while he was in the hospital. She likes nothing better than to live a pampered existence in her luxurious house in Westchester, New York and entertain her many lovers. Her solution to not using her powers on Earth is to always have a hand grenade on her person. * by Kinta, introduced in the Merlin Cycle: ** Coral, a princess from a nearby shadow called Begma, a result of Oberon's secret short liaison with the wife of a Begman diplomat. Although Coral is Merlin's willing lover, she is actually married to Rinaldo as part of a treaty between royal families. Coral is half-sister to Nayda. * by Paulette ** Random (orange, red, brown), a sneaky rascal, often irritating and called a 'punk' by his older siblings. Random helps Corwin regain his memory, and supports Corwin in his quest for the throne of Amber. After the final battle at the Courts of Chaos, the Unicorn chooses Random himself to succeed Oberon. Random's passions before this were gliding and drumming. It was after a \\"hot set\\" in his favorite Shadow that Brand contacted him through a card in a hand of poker he was playing, setting into motion the events that led him to contact Corwin at Flora's house in Westchester, New York. *** Martin, son of Random by Moire's daughter Morganthe. After walking the Pattern in Rebma, he wandered in Shadow until he encountered Benedict, who became a mentor. Brand later created a Trump for Martin, using it to summon him to the Primal Pattern, where he stabbed Martin, using the blood he shed to damage the Primal Pattern and allow the forces of Chaos to threaten Amber. ** Mirelle (red & yellow) * by Lora, introduced in the Merlin Cycle - or possibly by Harla (see above): ** Delwin (brown & black) and Sand (pale tan & dark brown), twin brother and sister. They only lived a short time in Amber, preferring to live in the Shadow worlds and keep themselves removed from the affairs of their siblings. (In the novel Blood of Amber, Merlin names Harla as the mother of Delwin and Sand and further states that Oberon was married to Harla while still married to Rilga, making this a bigamous marriage and calling the legitimacy of Delwin and Sand into question. It is known that neither has any interest in dynastic struggles.) * by Deela, an enemy of Amber, introduced in the Merlin Cycle: ** Dalt (black & green), Oberon's illegitimate son, a mercenary who possesses a keen hatred of Amber - his symbol is a lion rending a unicorn. He was conceived while Deela was Oberon's prisoner. (Or so he claims, probably having been told by his mother that Deela was raped. That may well be true, or it may be that she seduced Oberon as a way of working her way out of imprisonment and lied about it afterwards, when hostilities between Amber and Chaos resumed.) He is known to hang around the kingdom of Kashfa although he is outlawed there, and was Luke's childhood friend. Dalt is very strong, and recovered from being impaled on a sword by Benedict. The names of Florimel's and Random's mothers are not given in the novels; the names here are taken from the Visual Guide to Amber and the Complete Amber Sourcebook. The Visual Guide adds a younger daughter of Paulette, Mirelle, but she does not appear in any of the novels. Caine's parentage varies from book to book: Corwin places him above Bleys in the succession and Random also alludes to this but Merlin says he is a full brother of Julian and G√©rard. (Both statements could be true if Caine is, in fact, older than any of Clarissa's children, and the result of an illegitimate affair with Rilga but legally adopted into the line before Clarissa's children, just as Llewella was born illegitimate but legally adopted. Although Oberon did not actually marry Rilga till after finally divorcing Clarissa after the birth of Brand.) The Visual Guide to Amber and the Complete Amber Sourcebook, though both are authorised works, contradict each other.For more details on Caine's parentage, see section A7 of the Amber FAQ. Corwin also ignores his sisters in the succession. It is also mentioned that, although Llewella definitely (and possibly Caine, as mentioned above) was legally adopted into the family after being born illegitimate, this did not happen to Eric, because Oberon needed to remain on good terms with Cymnea's family, and Eric was perpetually bitter about this. In Nine Princes in Amber Corwin mentions his fondness for Random as related to being full brothers instead of half-brothers. However, he is still suffering from brain damage at the time. Given that only two books later, it is Corwin himself who mentions that his mother Faiella died giving birth to Deirdre, and Random was only born much later after many more children to other women, this can be put down to either an official authorial change and retcon (in book 3), or to Corwin's still-damaged memory (in book 1). In the Merlin Cycle, a Pattern-created ghost of Oberon claims that there were a total of 47 children, though only 20 are mentioned in the books. Corwin reliably states (while walking the pattern) there were once 15 brothers and 8 sisters, going on to say 6 brothers are dead as are 2 sisters (or possibly 4). Having no knowledge of Dalt at the time, this makes a total of 24 known children of Oberon, of which only 21 are ever named. One daughter and 3 sons are never named in any of the books or accompanying materials. =Other Amberites= *Lord Rein, a minstrel who was once knighted by Corwin *Roger, a guard in Castle Amber, and amateur author. Likely this is Zelazny writing himself into his novel. Corwin describes Roger as lean, cadaverous, pipe- smoking, and grinning, a description that would fit the author. Roger says that he is writing a \\"philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity,\\" and that he composes the \\"horror\\" portions while on duty in the dungeon. *Droppa MaPantz, the court jester in the Merlin Cycle. From time to time King Random takes him to Las Vegas to gather new material. Merlin and Corwin's friend Bill from Earth recognizes some of his jokes as being taken from George Carlin's act. *Bloody Bill, Bloody Andy, Bloody Eddie, restaurateurs in Amber. They successively run the same establishment with a reputation for good food and random violence. The restaurant is traditionally known by the name of the previous, deceased, owner, be it Bill, Andy etc. Proper table manners at \\"Bloody Bill's\\" (later \\"Bloody Andy's\\") include making sure your sword is partly unsheathed and visible to all. The Fish Fry is to- die-for (literally). *Vinta Bayle, Caine's mistress and daughter to Baron Bayle, Amber's vintner. For a time she is possessed by the ty'iga spirit which Dara has set to watch over Merlin. The ty'iga likes to seduce Merlin when in human form. *Jopin, keeper of the lighthouse at Cabra. A former sea captain who enjoys the simplicity and solitude of his job. The Courts of Chaos Perhaps fittingly, in all but the last novel there isn‚Äôt a specific name for characters from the Courts of Chaos. Both Chaosites and Chaosians are popular choices by fans; through the first series, they are referred to only as ‚Äúthe Courts‚Äù, or as ‚Äúthe forces of Chaos‚Äù. In the final book, those of the Courts of Chaos are referred to as Chaosites by Merlin. *Borel, a duke and master of arms of house Hendrake. Dara's fencing instructor. *Dara, great-granddaughter of Benedict, Corwin's lover, mother of Merlin of Amber, and wife of the Chaos nobleman Gramble Sawall *Gilva, a warrior-maiden of house Hendrake. *Gramble Sawall, Dara's husband, an ally of King Swayvil. *Jurt and Despil, Merlin's half brothers - sons of Dara (Merlin's mother) and Gramble Sawall. Jurt hates Merlin, while Despil tries to avoid conflicts. *Merlin of Amber, son of Dara and Corwin, great-great-grandson of Benedict, and narrator of the second cycle of books. *Mandor, Merlin's stepbrother, a son of Gramble Sawall from a previous marriage. He is a machiavellian manipulator, but Merlin likes him. His name may be derived from the Latin mandare, and is an anagram of \\"Random\\". *Suhuy (called Uncle Suhuy by Merlin), keeper of the Logrus and friendly adversary of Dworkin. *Swayvil, King of Chaos during the Merlin Cycle. Shadow dwellers *Ganelon, an exile from Avalon, killed and impersonated by Oberon. Based on the character of the same name from The Song of Roland. *Ghostwheel, a sentient computer created by Merlin of Amber, capable of generating Trump connections at a rate of thousands per second, apparently regarded by the Pattern and Logrus as a minor upstart in the ranks of cosmic powers. *Hugi, a fatalist talking raven. Based on Hugin, one of the two ravens who perched on Odin's shoulders in Norse mythology. *Jasra, a powerful sorceress, mother of Luke, tutor of Julia, former handmaid to Dara and deposed ruler of the Keep of Four Worlds. She has venomous lips and a thirst for power. *Julia Barnes, Merlin's ex-girlfriend, whom he finds murdered in her San Francisco apartment by a doglike monster from another world. This is later revealed to be a deception; Julia is alive under the alias of Mask and has become a sorceress, taking over the Keep of Four Worlds from Jasra. Merlin had taken her with him on a shadow walk, which led to their breakup and to her pursuing an interest in occult magic. * Lancelot, one of Ganelon's knights who was rescued by Corwin. Based on Sir Lancelot from Arthurian legend. *Lorraine, a camp follower with second sight in a shadow of the same name. *Victor Melman, occultist from Earth, associate and possible teacher of Julia Barnes, student of Jasra. Killed by Merlin using primal chaos. *Moire, queen of Rebma, maternal grandmother of Random's son Martin through her daughter Morganthe, who committed suicide after being abandoned by Random. *Rhanda, a vampire-like being called a shroudling. She and Merlin were childhood playmates. *Bill Roth, a lawyer from Earth, who aids Corwin and ends up being something of a confidant for Merlin, as well as legal counsel to the court of Amber. In Sign of the Unicorn, Bill, frustrated by Corwin's evasiveness, complains, \\"I've a peculiar feeling that I may never see you again. It is as if I were one of those minor characters in a melodrama who gets shuffled offstage without ever learning how things turn out.\\" *Sharu Garrul, Jasra's former tutor and a previous ruler of the Keep of the Four Worlds. * The Sphinx, a monster that devours those who cannot answer its riddles. Based on the riddling Sphinx of Thebes in the Greek myth of Oedipus. *The Ty'iga, a bodyless demon who inhabits the bodies of others. She is female, or at least feminine, though she is able to possess male bodies as well. When she leaves one's body the possessed person feels like waking up from a sleep and has no memory of the intervening time. She appears as Dan Martinez, George Hansen, Meg Devlin, Vinta Bayle and it is revealed that she was also Gail Lampron, a former girlfriend of Luke. She is finally bound in the body of Nayda, Coral's sister, since Nayda actually died from an illness just as she was possessed. She was originally set to watch and protect Merlin by his mother Dara, unless she caught sight of the Jewel. *Vialle, a blind noblewoman from Rebma whom Random is forced to marry. This was intended as a punishment for Random's affair with Moire's late daughter. Random would be bound to stay in Rebma for a year, and Vialle would gain status as a noble of Amber. To everyone's surprise, the marriage worked out well. She is artistic, creating sculptures by touch, specializing in busts of the Amberites. Vialle gives Luke/Rinaldo her protection in the form of her ring, ensuring that the vendetta against him by Caine's supporters will not be allowed to proceed. *Ygg, a talking tree planted by Oberon to mark the border between Order and Chaos. Based on Yggdrasil, the tree that holds up the sky in northern Germanic and Icelandic myths. The Powers The two main beings who control and create the Amber multiverse are The Pattern and The Logrus, who are immensely competitive and often cause collateral damage and casualties in the course of their struggles against each other. * The Pattern, sentient embodiment of Order. It is capable of manifesting as a unicorn, which according to Dworkin is the mother of Oberon, and of creating pattern-ghosts of any who have walked its path. In the Merlin cycle, the Pattern's spirit is implied to be older than the Primal Pattern, since it refers to events in its competition with the Logrus that predate Dworkin's creation of that Pattern. It appears to wish to impose unending, unmoving, static pure order over the universe. * The Logrus, embodiment of Chaos, also sentient and capable of manifesting as a giant serpent, and of creating semi-solid projections similar to pattern-ghosts. It claims that the Jewel of Judgement was its eye, stolen by the Unicorn; it appears to desire to return all existence to the primal chaos from which it came. * Corwin's Pattern, created by Corwin in The Courts of Chaos, it is also sentient and attempts to remain neutral in the conflict between the higher powers. It is also able to produce pattern-ghosts, and allies itself with Merlin, who along with Corwin is the only other being to walk its path. * The Ghostwheel, a computer-based, pattern-manipulating artificial intelligence created by Merlin in a secret location in the shadows, near Chaos. Like the trump cards, it is able to transport objects between shadow worlds, and to view goings-on in remote locations. It is not a cosmic-power like the patterns, but is able to act in defiance of them. The Ghostwheel is loyal to Merlin, and refers to him as \\"dad\\". * The Unicorn, a mysterious figure who only appears rarely, in the shape of a unicorn, at crucial points in some of the Amber stories. It always arrives to act as a protector of the family of Dworkin, but never speaks, and its image was adopted as an emblem of the realm of Amber. Dworkin reports that it provided him with the Jewel of Judgement, formerly one of the eyes of the snake apparition of the Logrus, so the Unicorn must have been an inhabitant or denizen of the Courts of Chaos, before Dworkin created the Primal Pattern. It also is reputed to have mated with Dworkin to produce his (only?) child, Oberon, and so is apparently the family's grandmother.

He was a son of siblings Manco Inca Yupanqui and Cura Ocllo.Titu Cusi Yupanqui, 2005, An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru, Boulder: University Press of Colorado, After the murder of his mother in 1539 and his father in 1544, both by the Spaniard conquerors, he became the ruler of the Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba. He ruled until 1560. Sayri Tupac's father Manco, the last ruling Inca emperor, had attempted to reach an accommodation with the Spanish conquistadors. He was crowned emperor in 1534 by Francisco Pizarro. However, his cooperation was severely tested by mistreatment at the hands of Francisco's brothers Gonzalo, Juan and Hernando, whom Francisco had temporarily left in charge in Cuzco. Manco escaped from the city and raised a large army of Inca warriors. During the civil war between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, Manco fought with the latter, besieging Cuzco for ten months but failed to take the city. After the defeat of Almagro, Manco retreated to Vilcabamba, inviting some of Almagro's supporters to take refuge with him. They did so, but then killed him, in front of Sayri T√∫pac and another of Manco's sons. Sayri T√∫pac was five years old at the time. He became Inca in Vilcabamba, reigning for ten years with the aid of regents. This was a time of peace with the Spanish. Viceroy Pedro de la Gasca offered to provide Sayri T√∫pac with lands and houses in Cuzco if he would emerge from the isolated Vilcabamba. Sayri T√∫pac accepted, but during the preparations his relative Paullu Inca suddenly died. This was taken as a bad omen (or a sign of Spanish treachery), and Sayri Tupac remained in Vilcabamba. thumb In 1556 a new Spanish viceroy, Andr√©s Hurtado de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Ca√±ete, arrived in the colony. Although the Inca in Vilcabamba was no longer ruler of an Indigenous empire, he was still ruler of an independent native state. Like Viceroy Gasca before him, Hurtado believed it would be safer for the Spanish if Sayri Tupac could be enticed to live in the area of Spanish settlement, where the conquistadors could control him. The negotiations took time, but Sayri T√∫pac did agree to leave Vilcabamba. He traveled in a rich litter with 300 attendants. On January 5, 1558, he was received amicably by Viceroy Hurtado in Lima. Sayri T√∫pac renounced his claim to the Inca Empire and accepted baptism, as Diego. In return he received a full pardon, the title of Prince of Yucay, and great estates with rich revenues. He became resident in Yucay, a day's journey northeast of Cuzco. Significantly, he left behind the royal red fringe, symbol of his authority. In Cuzco, he married his sister Cusi Huarcay after receiving a special dispensation from Pope Julius III. They had a daughter. Sayri T√∫pac never returned to Vilcabamba. He died suddenly in 1561. His half-brother Titu Cusi Yupanqui took control of Vilcabamba and the Inca resistance to the Spanish. Titu Cusi suspected that Sayri T√∫pac had been poisoned by the Spanish.

Background Formed by Simon Stone and Nicholas Broten in 1995, Fonda 500 have been releasing albums since 2000. Their songs appeared on the soundtrack to the British comedy television programme, Teachers on Channel Four, Colin Farrel film Intermission and E4's Skins (2010). They have built up a cult following since 2000, chiefly through their explosive live performances and their unique musical style, which draws elements from 60's pop music (Beach Boys harmonies) bedroom pop (usage of novelty instruments) and indie rock (electric guitars). Their first two albums were released on Village Records (Hull), followed by a signing to Truck Records (Oxford) for No. 1 Hifi Hair. Gentle Electric (Nottingham) released Spectrumatronicalogical Sounds and the ABCDELP. Their sixth album, Je m'appelle Stereo, was released on their own label Record mountain on 30 June 2008. After a recording hiatus during which the band continued to play live, 2014 saw the release of 8-Bit Sound System, a limited edition cassette which painstakingly rendered the entire of Eight Track Sound System into 8 bit. After a hiatus in recordingn, in November 2015 the band released 4 new singles to be accompanied by a limited edition Christmasette in December.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1947 Pacific hurricane season. At the time, tropical storms that formed within this region of the western Pacific were identified and named by the United States Armed Services, and these names are taken from the list that USAS publicly adopted before the 1945 season started. Storms =Tropical Storm Anna= Anna originated from a vigorous tropical wave that moved west along the ITCZ during the days of March 16 and 17. On March 18 an approaching cold front caused the wave to congeal into a tropical low pressure system while about 415 miles (670 km) to the east of Davao. The system rapidly organized into a tropical storm and continued west. Anna made landfall on Mindanao on March 20 as a tropical depression and weakened quickly thereafter. Little data is available for this system, however, the U.S. Air Weather Service noted that the storm was of little significance. =Unnamed Storm= The IBTrACSBest Tracks website lists an unnamed system of unknown strength forming near 11.4N 111.0E.

The resulting floods killed 1,077 people and left 853 people missing. =Typhoon Laura= =Typhoon Mildred= =Typhoon Nanette= =Typhoon Olive= =Typhoon Pauline= =Super Typhoon Rosalind= The origins of Rosalind can be track on a tropical storm that intensified into a category 2 on October 6 and named Rosalind. Therefore, Rosalind continued to rapidly intensify from 964 to 918 mbar, reaching its peak intensity. After Rosalind reaches its peak intensity, slight wind shear causes Rosalind to weaken on a category 2 on October 10. It intensified into a category 3 before it moved slowly. It weakened to a category 1 and tropical storm. Rosalind dissipated on October 14. Rosalind was the first super typhoon ever recorded in the Pacific Ocean. =Typhoon Alice= =Tropical Storm Beatrice= =Typhoon Cathy= =Typhoon Dora= =Tropical Storm Elnora= =Typhoon Flora= =Typhoon Gladys= =Typhoon Hannah= =Tropical Storm Irene= Tropical Storm Irene formed on November 30 between the Philippine Islands. It strengthened to a tropical storm with 50 mph winds before it made landfall on one of the islands. It curved northeast and weakened to a tropical depression. But after exiting land, it restrengthened to a moderate tropical storm. But shortly thereafter, it became extratropical on December 3. The Japan Meteorological Agency analyzed it as a tropical depression, though it was actually a moderate tropical storm. =Typhoon Jean= Typhoon Jean struck Manila during Christmas after forming in the Philippine sea moving West-northwest and accelerating as it makes landfall in the border area of Albay and Camarines sur. The storm continued its fast movement and track towards southern Manila. After passing Manila the storm emerges from the coast of Zambales towards the south china sea starting to shift more towards the northwest and eventually north and northeast. All the way moving parallel to the coast of Luzon. The typhoon weakened into a tropical storm and recurved west of Batanes island and passed through the Bashi channel south of Taiwan and continued north-eastward towards Miyakojima and the southern Japanese islands and eventually dissipating on the 29th of December. No data is available on what happened to the system after turning post-tropical. The curved track of Typhoon Jean is somewhat similar to that of Typhoon Flora the month before. Because Typhoon Jean battered Manila during Christmas there were reports of Christmas decorations being strewn around the city. There were also reports of wind damage in Para√±aque city.

The school story is a fiction genre centring on older pre-adolescent and adolescent school life, at its most popular in the first half of the twentieth century. While examples do exist in other countries, it is most commonly set in English boarding schools and mostly written in girls' and boys' subgenres, reflecting the single-sex education typical until the 1950s. It focuses largely on friendship, honour and loyalty between pupils. Plots involving sports events, bullies, secrets, rivalry and bravery are often used to shape the school story. The popularity of the traditional school story declined after the Second World War, but school stories have remained popular in other forms, with a focus on state run coeducational schools, and themes involving more modern concerns such as racial issues, family life, sexuality and drugs (see Grange Hill). More recently it has seen a revival with the success of the Harry Potter series, which uses many plot motifs commonly found in the traditional school story. History =Early works= The Governess, or The Little Female Academy by Sarah Fielding, published in 1749, is generally seen as the first boarding school story. Fielding's novel was a moralistic tale with tangents offering instruction on behavior, and each of the nine girls in the novel relates her story individually. However, it did establish aspects of the boarding school story which were repeated in later works. The school is self-contained with little connection to local life, the girls are encouraged to live together with a sense of community and collective responsibility. Fielding's approach was imitated and used as a formula by both her contemporaries and other writers into the 19th century. =Emergence of school stories in nineteenth century= School stories were a somewhat late arrival as a popular literature. Children as a market were generally not targeted until well into the nineteenth century. There was concern about the moral effect of novels on young minds, and those that were published tended to lean towards giving moral instruction. Thomas Hughes and successors Jane Eyre (1847) by Charlotte Bront√´, and Dombey and Son (1848) and David Copperfield (1850) by Charles Dickens had school story elements, which generated considerable public interest and close to 100 school stories had been published between 1749 and 1857, the year that Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes appeared. It is perhaps the most famous of all such tales, and its popularity helped firmly establish the genre, which rapidly expanded in the decades to follow across thousands of novels. Hughes never wrote another school story: the sequel Tom Brown at Oxford focused on university life. However, more school stories followed such as F.W. Farrar's Eric, or, Little by Little: A Tale of Roslyn School (1858), Revd H.C. Adams' Schoolboy Honour; A Tale of Halminster College (1861) and A.R. Hope's Stories of Whitminster (1873). In 1870 the Education Act paved the way for universal education for children, and so gave the market for school stories a considerable boost, which led to some publishers advertising novels specifically as school stories. Boys' magazines also began to be published which featured school stories, the best known being Boy's Own Paper, with its first issues appearing 1879. Talbot Baines Reed Talbot Baines Reed wrote a number of school stories in the 1880s, and contributed considerably to shaping the genre, taking inspiration from Thomas Hughes. His most famous work was The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's (1887) (serialised 1881‚Äì82). It was reprinted on a number of occasions, selling 750,000 copies in a 1907 edition. While seated in Baines Reed's Christian values, The Fifth Form at St Dominic's showed a definite leaning from the school story as instructional moral literature for children and with greater focus on the pupils and a defined plot. Gender difference in school stories As schools were segregated by gender in the nineteenth century, school stories naturally formed two separate but related genres of girls' school stories and boys' school stories. There had been an increase in female schooling from the 1850s, augmented by the 1870 Education Act. L. T. Meade, who also wrote historical novels and was a magazine editor, become the most popular writer of girls' school stories in the final decade of the nineteenth century. Her stories focused on upper class pupils at boarding schools who learned to earn trust by making mistakes, they had little focus on sports and were primarily interested in friendships and loyalty. They remained largely rooted in Victorian values and preparing girls to be proper wives and mothers. =Twentieth century= Most literature for girls at the turn of the twentieth century focused on the value of self-sacrifice, moral virtues, dignity and aspiring to finding a proper position in societal order. This was to a large extent changed by the publication of Angela Brazil's girls school stories in the early twentieth century, which featured energetic characters who challenged authority, played pranks, and lived in their own youthful world in which adult concerns were sidelined. Twentieth-century boys' school stories were often comical in nature ‚Äì examples being the Billy Bunter stories and the Jennings series. Coeducation remained rare in boarding school stories. Enid Blyton's Naughtiest Girl series was unusually set in a progressive coeducational school. J. K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series represents a more recent example of a mixed-sex boarding school. =Decline of the school story genre= The peak period for school stories was between the 1880s and the end of the Second World War. Comics featuring school stories also became popular in the 1930s. After World War II boarding school stories waned in popularity. Coeducational schools for all British schoolchildren were being funded by the public purse; critics, librarians and educational specialists became interested in creating a more modern curriculum and tended to see stories of this type as outdated and irrelevant. School stories have remained popular, however, with a focus shifting towards state-funded day schools with both girls and boys, and dealing with more contemporary issues such as sexuality, racism, drugs and family difficulties. The Bannerdale series of five novels (1949‚Äì56) by Geoffrey Trease, starting with No Boats on Bannermere, involved two male and two female pupils of day schools in the Lake District, and a widowed mother. Trease was inspired to set the series in a day school following a letter from a young reader complaining that, despite being the setting for many school stories, boarding schools were in fact no more exciting environments than day schools. This is something remarked upon by the narrator. The Harry Potter series of novels has in some respects revived the genre, despite having a strong leaning towards fantasy conventions. Elements of the school story prominent in Harry Potter including the action being described almost exclusively from the point of view of pupils. Elsewhere While school stories originated in Britain with Tom Brown's Schooldays, school stories were also published in other countries. 'Schulromane' were popular in Germany in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and school stories were also published in Soviet Russia. Some American classic children's novels also relate to the genre, including What Katy Did at School (1873) by Susan Coolidge, Little Men (1871) by Louisa May Alcott and Little Town on the Prairie (1941) by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The 1980s and 1990s Sweet Valley High series by Francine Pascal and others are set in California. However, the core school story theme of the school as a sort of character in itself, actively formed by the pupils and their enjoyment of being there, is primarily a British and American phenomenon. In France, M√©moires d'Un Coll√©gien (1907) by Andr√© Laurie (Jean-Fran√ßois Paschal Grousset), set in a boarding-school context similar to Talbot Baines Reed's St. Dominic's in England and Arthur Stanwood Pier's St. Timothy's in America,\\"Arthur Stanwood Pier\\" by William C. Dowling would have a considerable influence on French stories in the genre. German school stories tended to be written for adults, in the tradition of the earlier Bildungsroman, and explored the disruption the school environment made to a character's sense of individuality. Soviet stories tended to focus on how individualistic behaviour could be corrected and brought into line with collective goals by the school environment. See also manga such as School Rumble and US dramas Beverly Hills 90210, Glee and Pretty Little Liars. Themes The vast majority of school stories involve the culture of boarding schools in general. Common themes include honour, decency, sportsmanship and loyalty. Competitive team sports often feature and an annual sports event between rival school houses is frequently a part of the plot. Friendships between pupils are a common focus and also relationships with particular teachers, and the difficulty of new pupils fitting into the school culture is a central theme. Bullies often feature in school stories, particularly boys' school stories. Identical twins appear with some frequency and are often the subject of comedy. School principals are usually even handed and wise and provide guidance to characters and will often bend the rules to get them out of trouble. Earlier in the development of the genre, school stories avoided dealing with adolescence or puberty directly.George Brown's Schooldays (1946) by Bruce Marshall is a novel dealing with boarding school education; it is much more sensitive to the misery and sexuality of all-male boarding, disqualifying itself from the genre. Eric, or, Little by Little by Dean Farrar was a classic moral tract set in a boarding school. Its Victorian tone was never adopted as generic convention. Writers Commercially successful authors of school novels include writers for boys, such as P. G. Wodehouse, Anthony Buckeridge, and prolific writer Charles Hamilton, better known as Frank Richards, who wrote the Greyfriars School series, St. Jim's and Rookwood, and others for the Amalgamated Press between 1906 and 1940, his most famous character being Billy Bunter. Writers for girls include Angela Brazil, Enid Blyton, Elinor Brent-Dyer, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Mary Gervaise and Elsie Oxenham.

It is a brick building dating to the first decade of the 20th century. Its tall clock tower, built by the Seth Thomas Company, is the city's most prominent landmark. Designed by the New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, it handled 66 passenger trains a day at its peak. Later in the 20th century, when the city's rail service had declined to its current level of one commuter route, the building's interior was closed. Today it is in use again as the offices of the Republican-American, Waterbury's daily newspaper. Building The station building is located just west of downtown Waterbury, where Meadow and Grand streets intersect. To its north and south are other industrial buildings; southwest is the current platform station used by Metro-North and its parking facilities. On the west are 12 tracks, most of which are rarely used; beyond them are industrial buildings, the Naugatuck River and the Connecticut Route 8 freeway. A short distance down Meadow Street are the on-ramps to the Interstate 84 viaduct carrying it over the river, tracks and Route 8. =Exterior= There are four sections to the building, counting the clock tower. The two-story main block has a low hip roof with the clock tower rising from the southeast corner. Two wings with a tiled hip roof project from either side of the main block. All are of brick laid in common bond on a granite foundation; at the roofline is a roll molding of terra cotta. alt=The upper section of the station's clock tower, with the features described in the text On the east (front) facade of the main block are three two-story round-arched window openings, filled in near the top where a new floor was later added. They are outlined in terra cotta in a stylized vine pattern, bordered by pearl, egg-and-dart and anthemion molding. Spacing them are four round medallions made of two rings of raised radial brick and a raised ring of fasces molding. Above is a course of terra cotta round-arched corbel table topped by egg-and-dart, a frieze with cherubs and projecting leaf molding. The level above has a series of small rectangular windows, three above each arch and one above each medallion. At the roofline is a cornice similar to the one below but more intricate, with carved modillions, a fluted frieze and wide carved cyma molding. The west facade is similar, although smaller windows and awnings have been added. The lower two stages of the square tower have one narrow opening and the same cornices as the rest of the main block. Above its roofline the tower is plain for most of its height, except for some rows of small openings. The station clock faces on each side, marked in Roman numerals, are three-quarters of the way to the top. They and the clock hands are in cast aluminum. Above long tapered corbels support a balcony with heraldric shields on its stone rail. Gargoyles project from each corner. The last stage, the belfry, has tall round-arched windows, another set of gargoyles and a tiled hip roof. Both wings are similar. They are narrower than the main building, with east and west facades decorated with an arcade of seven rounded arches. Each is slightly recessed, with a rectangular window. On the north wing's east facade, windows have been added to the previously blind arch portion to provide illumination for the second story. A simpler version of the main block cornice, with dentils and cyma molding at the arches' springline, give a capital-like appearance to the piers between the arches. alt=A brick building with snow-covered ground and a bare tree at the lower left. The portion of the building nearer the camera, on the right, has large rounded indentations in it and a metal roof hung from its side by cables over a bare concrete surface. The portion on the left, farther away, has been fenced off. It is taller, with a large square section rising to the top of the image in the center. A printing press was added to the north wing to support the newspaper. It is small and architecturally sympathetic, lessening the impact of its disruption of the building's overall symmetry. On the west of the south wing is a gabled remnant of the original platform shelter, supported by iron trusses on center posts and cables from the building. A shed roof on large iron brackets at the south end, formerly the baggage handling area, is now a default waiting area for Metro-North passengers in inclement weather. =Interior= Inside, the Republican-American has made changes to accommodate its purposes. Most prominently, the main block and north wing have had a second story added. In the offices on the new second floor some of the original vaulted ceiling, with large light-colored Guastavino tile in a herringbone pattern. These tiles are the same used at the Boston Public Library, Ellis Island, Grant's Tomb, the Biltmore Estate and other architecturally significant buildings. The window surrounds have similarly lavish decorations as the exterior, with two bands of terra cotta separated by dentils done in leaves and pearl molding. The buff brick walls likewise has a dentilled cornice with an engaged baluster-and-ring turning and a wide cyma molding done in a stylized floral pattern. The south wing's interior, originally a restaurant, remained in use as a waiting room. Inside it has some original decor suggesting that purpose. They include brass ticket windows, a long Mission style wooden bench, iron radiator grill and marble baseboards and sills. Its vaulted ceiling and walls are done in plaster. History The previous station shortly before it was replaced In the early years of the 20th century, the city of Waterbury, then prosperous and growing, began working with the New Haven and other railroads serving it on an urban renewal program to clear the way for a newer, larger station they all needed. Streets were straightened and buildings demolished in the neighborhood to the east. A small park replaced some of them. McKim, Mead & White's design, extravagant in size and decoration, was meant to symbolize the city's prosperity and the railroads' importance to it. As many as 66 passenger trains served Waterbury at the peak of its traffic. The firm's design is different from its typically academic style in its efforts to unite the interior and exterior through similar materials and decorative themes, as well as the vaulted ceiling echoing the arches of the windows. The light reflecting off the warm interior colors through the large arched windows of the main facade made the building particularly welcoming at night. I-84 as it approaches the city from the westalt=At bottom, one roadway of an expressway divides as it approaches a city skyline above it in the distance with the clock tower dominant on the left. Behind the city is a wooded hillside with development interspersed. Traffic on the road is heading away from the camera, following a left off ramp with a sign above it directing traffic to a place called Torrington via a highway with the number 8 in black on a white square; while the two main lanes veer right following a highway numbered \\"84\\" to the east in white on a semicircular red and blue background with white trim. A year after construction began, the president of one of the railroads asked for a clock tower, given Waterbury's proximity to the Seth Thomas plant. McKim obliged with one based on the 14th-century Torre del Mangia in Siena, Italy. Architectural historian Carroll Meeks, in The Railroad Station: An Architectural History, believes that model was chosen as a deliberate rebuke to architectural amateurs such as the rail executive. The clock tower dominated the city's skyline then and continues to do so today, when most travelers arrive in the city via interstate highway instead of the train. In summer 1909, the completed station was opened. As intended, it catalyzed development in the neighborhood. A few years later, the American Brass Company, representing another industry identified with the city and region, built new headquarters across Meadow Street from the station. Its architecture closely harmonized in size and material with the station. The station continued to be used for intercity rail service to the city. The New Haven's Nutmeg and several unnamed trains operated east to Hartford and Boston until 1955.New Haven April 1955 timetable, Table 18 The company also operated trains northeast from New York City, through Waterbury, to New Britain and Hartford.'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1949, New Haven section, Table 5 The Naugatuck and other NH trains went north to Winsted and south toward New York City.'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1949, New Haven section, Table 30 Service declined and then stopped in the later decades of the 20th century. The last commercial service out the station was by the Penn Central railroad company. In the 1970s one of the two newspapers that later became the Republican-American moved into the building, modifying it on the inside and out for that purpose. At that time the south wing was still being used by Metro-North commuter rail passengers as a waiting area; since then that portion of the interior has been closed off and a new platform built. In 1973, Republican-American Publisher William J. Pape assigned company machinist John A. Correia to restore the original mechanisms of the station clock tower, which had been replaced by an electrical tower clock in 1963. The original mechanism is still functioning, on display in the lobby of the station.

In a way to stop the protest, the administration through the Lagos state police commissioner Fatai Owoseni, released a statement that the protest was ban in the state, stating that hoodlums would hijack it and use the protest to cause havoc, the statement was rebuffed and ignored publicly why publicity of the protest continued on social media. On 4 February 2017, Tuface released a video that he was cancelling the protest due to security reasons but rumors circulating around the digital space have it that the administration through the DSS picked him up earlier that day and pressured him to cancel the much- hyped protest, though he later made a series of tweets from his official Twitter account to deny the claim.

Kunekune are hairy with a rotund build, and may bear wattles hanging from their lower jaws. Their colour ranges from black and white, to ginger, cream, gold-tip, black, brown and tricoloured. They have a docile, friendly nature, and are now often kept as pets. History The breed is believed to have descended from an Asian domestic breed introduced to New Zealand in the early 19th century by whalers or traders. They differ markedly from the feral pig of European origin known in New Zealand as a \\"Captain Cooker\\".\\"Captain Cooker\\" , Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand The native MƒÅori people of New Zealand adopted kunekune; kunekune is a MƒÅori-language word meaning \\"fat and round\\". By the 1980s, only an estimated 50 purebred kunekune remained. Michael Willis and John Simister, wildlife-park owners, started a breeding recovery programme, which encouraged other recovery efforts. , the breed no longer faces extinction, with breed societies in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In 1993, two were imported into the United States from the UK.[1] Appearance The kunekune is covered in hair which can be long or short, and straight or curly. Hair colours include black, brown, ginger, gold, cream, and spotted combinations. It has a medium to short slightly upturned snout that is black and either semilopped or pricked ears. It has a short, round body with short legs and may have two wattles (called piri piri) under its chin. The kunekune stands about 60 cm (24 in) tall. An adult kunekune can weigh between 60 and 200 kg. Habitat The natural habitat for kunekune is woodland and pasture. They thrive in the outdoors. Diet Kunekune are very easy to manage, as they have the ability to live on little more than grass. They are the only true grazing pig, and can be maintained with mostly grass with a little supplementary feeding. One acre of grass can sustain as many as six kunekune. Breeding Kunekune boars become fertile at six to seven months, while the gilts can become pregnant at five months. However, gilts are not normally mated to the boar until they are a year old. The sows are good mothers, and the litters vary in size averaging around seven piglets.

The Briggs' Plan was a military plan devised by British General Sir Harold Briggs shortly after his appointment in 1950 as Director of Operations during the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960). The plan aimed to defeat the Malayan communist guerrillas by cutting them off from their sources of support amongst the rural population. To achieve this a large programme of forced resettlement of Malayan peasantry was undertaken, under which about 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya's population) were forcefully removed from their land and imprisoned in internment camps called \\"New Villages\\". During the Emergency there were over 400 of these guarded camps. Furthermore, 10,000 Malaysian Chinese people suspected of being communist sympathisers were deported to mainland China by 1949 where many were then executed. The Malayan aboriginals, the Orang Asli, were also targeted for forced relocation by the Briggs' Plan because the British believing that they were supporting the communists. Many of the practices necessary for the Briggs' Plan were prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and customary international law which stated that the destruction of property must not happen unless rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.  History  British authority in Malaya's rural areas had only been tenuously reestablished following the withdrawal of Japan at the end of World War II. The British regarded a group of about 500,000 \\"squatters\\", largely of Chinese descent, who practiced small-scale agriculture, generally lacked legal title to their land, and were largely outside the reach of the colonial administration, as particularly problematic. Many of these Chinese people had been forced to live in isolated communities to avoid slaughter by the occupying Japanese. In order to force rural workers off their land, the British military burned down rural villages, destroyed crops and killed livestock. Some villagers would later receive compensation but most would not. These communities formed the backbone of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), their armed wing the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), and their civilian supplies and intelligence network the 'Min Yuen'. Many rural workers were sympathetic to communism due to their role of the MCP as leaders of the WWII Anti-Japanese resistance movement. Other factors which led to support for the communists include; the desire for Malayan independence from Britain, the communist victory in China, the communist role in leading the Malayan trade union movement, economic inequality and poverty post-WWII and resentment towards the racism of British rule. Other rural workers who did not want to support the communist guerrillas did so anyway due to fear of backlash by their neighbours and the communist guerrillas. By isolating this population in the \\"new villages\\", the British were able to stem the critical flow of food, information, and recruits from peasants to guerillas. The new settlements were guarded around-the-clock by police and many were partially fortified with barbed wire and sentry towers. This served the twofold purpose of preventing those who were so inclined from getting out and voluntarily aiding the guerrilla, and of preventing the guerrilla from getting in and extracting help via persuasion or intimidation. 450 new settlements were created in this process and it is estimated that 470,509 people, 400,000 of them Chinese, were involved in the program. The Malaysian Chinese Association, (known then as the Malayan Chinese Association), played a crucial role in implementing the programme. The British also tried to win the support of some of the internees by providing them with education and health services. Some New Villages were equipped with amenities such as electricity and piped water and surrounded with perimeter fencing and armed guards to keep the civilians from escaping‚Äì many of whom had formerly been in the MCP or had been forced to provide assistance. It was hoped that by providing the largely ethnic Chinese communities with such facilities, they would be converted from \\"reservoirs of resentment into bastions of loyal Malayan citizenry\\". However, critics argue that the homogenous nature of New Villages -- with the few multiracial ones eventually failing or turning into ghettoes -- worked against this goal, instead accentuating communalist fervour and causing racial polarisation, especially in politics, as electoral constituencies would now be delineated more along racial lines. Previously, the Chinese rural workers and peasants had been spread out geographically, but the Briggs' Plan would now bring together rural Chinese from all over the country and concentrate them in the New Villages. There was significant resentment towards the programme both among the Chinese and Malays. The Chinese frequently suffered from collective punishment, preventive detention and summary deportation aimed at weeding out communist supporters, while the Malays were incensed at the infrastructure provided for the New Villages as their own settlements remained undeveloped.Ongkili, pp. 85-88. One example of this collective punishment comes from Tanjung Malim where the British put the civilian population on rice rations in order to stop them from supporting the communist guerrillas. When this did not work, Gerald Templer halved the rice rations for civilians within the area and imposed a 22 hour curfew.  Similar examples  Forcibly removing a population that might be sympathetic to guerrillas was a counter- insurgency (COIN) technique which the British had used before, notably initiated by Kitchener against the Boer Commandos in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). The Briggs' Plan and the New Village system became a model for British counterinsurgency efforts in Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising. Upon completion of the programme, the British initiated the Hunger Drive in an effort to flush out the communists from the jungle. ‚ÄúFour cuts‚Äù strategy against villages and insurgents of Communist Party of Burma insurgents in Pegu Range.

They belong to the typical fly suborder Brachycera as can be seen by their short antennae, and more precisely they are members of the section Schizophora. There are over 1,300 species and about 125 genera accepted as valid today, but new taxa are still being described. Unlike the large \\"corpse flies\\" or blow-flies of the family Calliphoridae and the large dung flies of the family Scathophagidae, the small dung flies are members of the schizophoran subsection Acalyptratae. Among their superfamily Sphaeroceroidea, they seem to be particularly close relatives of the family Heleomyzidae. Sphaeroceridae morphological details Description and ecology Housefly (left) vs. small dung fly (right) For terms see Morphology of Diptera Dung flies are small to minute, usually dull-colored flies with characteristically thickened first tarsomere of the posterior leg. The first tarsal segment is less than times as long as the second tarsal segment and dilated. The crossvein separating the second basal and discal cells is missing. Veins four and five often fade apically. They occur all over the world except in regions with permanent ice-cover. Despite their ubiquity and abundance, little is known about their economic or ecological impact. Some species are known to be parthenogenetic. Larval stages are poorly known, but those described are slender, narrowed anteriorly, with groups of ventral spicules on creeping welts. The larva is amphipneustic (having only the anterior and posterior pairs of spiracles). The mandibles are simple, hooked, and without additional teeth. The parastomal bars are long, thin structures, fused to the tentoropharyngeal sclerite. The hypopharyngeal sclerites are long separate or connected by a sclerotized bridge; the anterior spiracle (prothoracic spiracle) is a rosette or branched. The posterior spiracles (on the anal segment) are usually on two cylindrical lobes. Each spiracle has three slit or oval openings and three or five groups of interspiracular hairs that are branched in some species. The larvae are microbial grazers found in abundance in many microenvironments with decomposing organic material. Most species appear to be associated with decaying plants or fungi and they are a part of the nutrient cycle. Some species, especially cave species, are polysaprophagous. Many species are associated with various kinds of faeces including human faeces; there are a few carrion-feeding species. These, however, are extremely abundant and are important components of the carrion- insect community. Sphaerocerids that abound in economically important decomposer communities such as compost and manure, and some decay cycles such as the wrack (seaweed) cycle are mediated by sphaerocerid-dominated insect communities. As their microbe-associated habits suggest, sphaerocerids may carry many pathogenic microorganisms.Greenberg, B., 1971. Flies and Disease, volume I: Ecology, Classification,and Biotic Association. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. Although their reclusive habits preclude a major role in disease transmission; some can present a public health hazard on occasion or act as a warning of one. For instance Leptocera caenosa and other sphaerocerids are associated with blocked sewage drains. Some species occasionally reach high population levels in food-processing plants and other buildings where they may indicate blocked drains, waste accumulation and inadequate hygiene. One species, Poecilosomella angulata, has been implicated in human intestinal myiasis They have been implicated as the major means by which nematodes are disseminated among mushroom houses. Sphaeoceridae often coexist with muscoids especially Fannia canicularis and Musca domestica in the complex manure ecosystem of poultry houses, and other confined-animal facilities. Here the sphaeocerids are prey for mites and beetles, which themselves also feed on the immatures of muscoid flies reducing the population of the more problematic muscoids.Axtell, R. C. (1985). Chapter 16: \\"Poultry Pests\\". In: Livestock Entomology (Williams et al., editors), Wiley & Sons, New York. pp. 269‚Äì293.

The apparatus takes the exhaust steam that would normally be used to produce a draft for the firebox, and routes it through a heat exchanger, into the boiler water tanks. Installations vary depending on the purpose, design and the type of locomotive to which it is fitted. It differs from the usual closed cycle condensing steam engine, in that the function of the condenser is primarily either to recover water, or to avoid excessive emissions to the atmosphere, rather than maintaining a vacuum to improve both efficiency and power. Thermodynamics Unlike the surface condenser often used on a steam turbine or marine steam engine, the condensing apparatus on a steam locomotive does not normally increase the power output, rather it decreases due to a reduction of airflow to the firebox that heats the steam boiler. In fact it may reduce it considerably. Condensing the steam from a high volume gas to a low volume liquid causes a significant pressure drop at the exhaust, which usually would add additional power in most steam engines. Whilst more power is potentially available by expanding down to a vacuum, the power output is actually greatly reduced compared to a conventional steam locomotive on account of the lower air flow through the firebox, as there is now no waste steam to eject into the firebox exhaust in order to pull more air into the firebox air intake. In order to produce similar power, air to the firebox must be provided by a steam driven or mechanically driven fan. This often cancels out any improvement in efficiency. The temperature of the exhaust steam is greater than typical stationary or ship-based steam plant of similar power due to having fewer waste recovery stages, as ships often have an additional low pressure stage or even a low speed turbine. Waste heat on modern steam plants is often recovered using heat exchangers. However, condensing locomotives do not have this benefit due to the waste heat being expelled to the surrounding air and not being recovered, and therefore none of the energy in the waste steam is recovered to do mechanical work. In many conditions the temperature gradient is often much worse due to using air instead of having an abundant source of cooling water, which is usually the case with naval or stationary steam power plants. The Anderson condensing system significantly reduces these losses by only partially cooling the waste steam before compressing it into condensate, then pumping the high temperature condensate back into the boiler in order to recover the unused waste heat. This greatly reduces energy waste. Because of the relatively high temperature in a locomotive condenser and the rejection of the heat to the air, the potential improvement in thermal efficiency expected from including the condenser in the cycle is not usually realised within the space constraints of a typical locomotive. Indeed, losses due to viscous friction in the condenser piping, and having to pump the condensate back into the boiler is likely to reduce the power output over what was achievable from simply venting to atmosphere. These restrictions do not apply to marine or stationary steam engines due to not having size or weight restrictions. Ships often had massive waste steam recovery systems, such as the 400 ton waste steam turbine used to recover very low 6psi waste steam on the Titanic and its sister ships.Titanic: Building the World's Most Famous Ship By Anton Gill, P121 This is several times the weight of an entire locomotive, and so is clearly not feasible as a form of waste steam recovery for locomotives.  Exhaust draught  A drawback of condensing the exhaust steam is that it is no longer available to draw the fire, by use of the blastpipe. The draught must thus be generated instead by a steam-driven fan. Where possible, this has been arranged to use exhaust steam, although in some cases live steam was required, with extra steam and thus fuel consumption. Types of condenser Steam locomotive condensers may be water-cooled or air- cooled. =Water tank condenser= Here, the exhaust steam is blown into cold water in the locomotive's water tanks. A non-return system must be fitted, to prevent water from the tanks being drawn into the cylinders when the steam is shut off. This system was mainly used for locomotives working in tunnels. =Air condenser= Here, the exhaust steam is blown into an air-cooled radiator, similar to that used for the cooling system of an internal combustion engine. This system was used on small tram engines (where the condenser was mounted on the roof) and on large tender engines (where the condenser was mounted in the tender). =Anderson system= The Anderson condensing system uses an air-cooled condenser but the steam is only partially condensed to form an aerosol of water droplets in steam. This aerosol is then liquified by pressure, using a specially-designed boiler feed pump. A fuel saving of nearly 30% (compared with exhausting to the atmosphere) was claimed for the Anderson system but this seems paradoxical. One would expect a higher fuel consumption because of the power required to compress the aerosol. The reason this is possible is due to Carnot's theorem, which states that pumping heat requires less energy than producing the heat itself. A similar effect known as Vapor-compression desalination was later used for desalination of water. Instead of returning the condensate water to the boiler, the hot compressed condensate is passed through a heat exchanger to return heat to the boiler, then released as clean drinking water. It is one of the most efficient processes used to desalinate water.*AN ADVANCED MECHANICAL VAPOR COMPRESSION DESALINATION with VVC SYSTEM in desalination and purfying water industry  Purpose  There are two usual reasons for fitting condensing equipment - reducing exhaust emissions and increasing range. = Reduced exhaust emissions = Underground railways Metropolitan Railway A Class Note the large valves in the steam return pipes, switching between condensing and non-condensing modes. Originally developed for the Metropolitan Railway to allow their locomotives to work the tunnels of the London Underground. This system was devised by Daniel Gooch and developed by Beyer Peacock. Steam is diverted from the exhaust steam pipes into the water tanks via condensing pipes within the same tanks. The water in the tanks could quickly heat up near boiling point, reducing the condensing effect on the exhaust steam. It was not unknown for the tanks to be emptied and refilled with cold water on a regular basis. Ordinary injectors will not work with hot water (until hot-water injectors were developed) so condensing locomotives were usually fitted with axle-driven boiler feedwater pumps. When not working in tunnels, the steam was directed to the blast pipe and up the chimney in the usual way. Roadside tramways In Britain, locomotives working on roadside steam tramways were required by law to have condensers. Water tank condensers (as above) were sometimes used but air-condensers were more common. A steam tram engine usually had a full-length roof and this was surmounted by a nest of air-cooled copper tubes in which the exhaust steam was condensed. Kitson & Co. made many engines of this type. The system was satisfactory for tram engines (which were very low-powered) but would not have worked for larger railway locomotives. = Increased range = Generally this was a more sophisticated installation that used forced air cooling to condense the exhaust steam. The system was intended to reduce the problems of getting enough water to steam locomotives running through desert and very arid areas, eg. South Africa.

It was directed by William K. Howard and written by Clemence Dane from the novel Fire Over England by AEW Mason. Leigh's performance in the film helped to convince David O. Selznick to cast her as Scarlett O'Hara in his production of Gone with the Wind. The film is a historical drama set during the reign of Elizabeth I focusing on England's victory over the Spanish Armada.Vermilye 1978, pp. 36‚Äì38. Plot During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, England is concerned by the impending arrival of the Spanish Armada. In 1588, relations between Spain and England are at breaking point. With the support of Queen Elizabeth I (Flora Robson), English privateers such as Sir Francis Drake regularly capture Spanish merchantmen bringing gold from the New World. Elizabeth's chief advisers are the Lord Treasurer, Lord Burleigh (Morton Selten), and her longtime admirer, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Leslie Banks). Burleigh's 18-year-old granddaughter Cynthia (Vivien Leigh) is one of Elizabeth's ladies-in-waiting, and the ageing queen is plagued by jealousy of the girl's beauty and vivacity. In a sea battle between the Spanish, led by Don Miguel (Robert Rendel), and the English, led by his old friend Sir Richard Ingolby (Lyn Harding) the English are captured. Miguel allows Richard's son Michael (Laurence Olivier) to escape. Michael swims ashore on Miguel's estate, and his wounds are tended to by Miguel's daughter Elena (Tamara Desni), who quickly becomes enamoured of the handsome Englishman, despite her being engaged to marry. As the months pass, Michael recovers and laments being apart from Cynthia, his sweetheart, but is nonetheless impressed by Elena's charms. Miguel brings Michael the sad news that Sir Richard, his father, has been executed as a heretic. The grieving Michael denounces his rescuers and flees to England in a small fishing boat. When he is granted an audience with the Queen he urges her to fight the Spanish menace by whatever means necessary, and swears undying loyalty to her. Elizabeth is flattered by the young man's fervent devotion and later has an opportunity to take advantage of his offer of service when Hillary Vane (James Mason), an Englishman spying for Spain, is killed before the names of his English co-conspirators can be uncovered. Michael, disguised as Vane, goes to the court of King Philip II of Spain (Raymond Massey) to get the letters that will set into motion a plan to assassinate Elizabeth. At the palace Michael meets Elena. Her father has been killed by the English and she is now married to Don Pedro (Robert Newton), the palace governor. Elena keeps Michael's identity a secret as long as she can, but finally must tell her husband out of loyalty to him. Philip sees through Michael's disguise and orders his arrest. Pedro helps him escape so that it will not be discovered that his wife aided a heretic. While Michael is returning home, the Spanish Armada sails against England and Elizabeth addresses her army at Tilbury. Michael meets her there and reveals the names of the traitors. Elizabeth knights Michael before confronting the six traitors, inviting them to fulfill their plot and kill her. Overwhelmed with shame, they agree to accompany Michael on a mission to deploy fire ships in a night attack on the Armada, massed off the coast of England. The tactic succeeds, and Elizabeth allows Michael and Cynthia to be wed.

The Lion Has Wings A portion of the film, including the beacons being lit on the English coast, and an armour-clad Queen Elizabeth giving her speech to the surrounding soldiers at Tilbury before the Battle of Gravelines, was used in the 1939 World War II propaganda documentary The Lion Has Wings. It is used to compare the Spanish invasion attempt to a Nazi invasion, demonstrating how Great Britain had survived against great odds in the past, and would again. The central theme of the film alludes to a perceived Nazi invasion, even though at the time of the film's release the Battle of Britain was still three years away. Reception Fire Over England was the first British film to have its US premiere at Los Angeles. Overall, the picture garnered positive reviews. In the review in Variety, the comment was \\"This is a handsomely mounted and forcefully dramatic glorification of Queen Bess.

The screenplay was written by John Monk Saunders and Leon Gordon. The film was produced by MGM-British at Denham Studios. A Yank at Oxford marks Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor's first film appearance together; they would later appear as the romantic lead couple in the remake of Waterloo Bridge (1940). Before this film, Taylor was seen as the \\"romantic love interest\\" and thus as a 1930s equivalent to Rudolph Valentino, with men therefore starting to doubt Taylor's masculinity. His casting in this film (by Mayer) was a successful attempt to put paid to such doubts, and dramatically boosted his reputation with both men and women.Wayne 1973, p. 79. Plot A cocky American athlete named Lee Sheridan (Robert Taylor) receives a scholarship to attend Cardinal College, University of Oxford in 1937. At first, Lee is reluctant to go to the college owing to his father, Dan's, (Lionel Barrymore) limited income, but he finally does attend. Once in England, Lee brags about his athletic triumphs to Paul Beaumont (Griffith Jones), Wavertree (Robert Coote), and Ramsey (Peter Croft) on the train to Oxford. Annoyed, they trick Lee into getting off the train at the wrong stop. Lee, however, does make his way to Oxford where the students attempt to trick him again, this time into thinking that he is getting a grand reception. Seeing through the deception, he follows the prankster impersonating the Dean and after chasing him is thrown off and ends up kicking the real Dean of Cardinal (Edmund Gwenn) before retreating. This begins a contentious relationship between them when Lee reports to apologize. Lee considers leaving Oxford but stays on after being convinced by Scatters (Edward Rigby), his personal servant. Lee meets Elsa Craddock (Vivien Leigh), a married woman who \\"helps\\" the new campus students, and starts a relationship with Paul Beaumont's sister Molly (Maureen O'Sullivan). Lee makes the track team by outpacing other runners while wearing a cap and gown. Just when he begins to fit in, he is hazed for refusing to rest during a crucial relay race at a track meet and pushing his replacement Paul out of the way in his zeal to win. In a fit of anger, Lee goes to a pub, which students are forbidden to frequent, to confront Paul, finding him in a private booth with Elsa. He starts a fight with Paul but Wavertree warns them of the arrival of the Oxford University police, the \\"Bullers\\". Lee and Paul run and when they are almost caught by one of the Bullers, Lee punches him. Paul is called before the Dean and fined and warned for hitting the Buller. He is scorned for revealing it was Lee who did it and Lee is soon the favorite of Paul's old friends. Molly begins to see Lee again, but he still feels regretful for what has happened between him and Paul. Lee begins rowing for Oxford University Boat Club and in the bumps race for Cardinal's boat club, tries to make amends to Paul after winning a race, but Paul rejects the offer of friendship. Despite this, Lee still helps Paul by hiding Elsa in his own room when Elsa is looking for Paul. The Dean catches the two of them together and expels Lee from Oxford. Lee's father, Dan, comes for the races having not heard of Lee's expulsion from Oxford University. When Lee tells him that he had been having an affair with Elsa, Dan believes he is lying. Judging from Lee's effusive letters about Molly, he feels that Lee could not possibly have had an affair with Elsa. Dan meets with Molly and the two devise a plan to get Lee back into college. Dan meets with Elsa at the bookstore and convinces her to talk to the Dean. After flirting with the Dean and telling him that Lee was only hiding her from Wavertree, Lee is allowed back into Oxford and Wavertree, who has spent the entire story trying to be expelled so he can come into an inheritance, receives to his disappointment only a minor punishment. Lee and Paul make amends and win the boat race.

Retrieved: 27 January 2015. During the filming of A Yank at Oxford, Leigh gained a reputation for being \\"difficult\\" to work with. According to her biographer Alexander Walker, Leigh felt judged by Maureen O'Sullivan, whom she had befriended years earlier at school, because O'Sullivan was happily married and Leigh was in the midst of an affair with Laurence Olivier and awaiting word of a divorce from her first husband, Leigh Holman. Therefore, the relationship was \\"strained.\\" Also Leigh had developed a foot problem whereupon she asked to go to London to seek treatment. As Leigh was preparing to leave, the wardrobe department cut a hole in her shoes so that her toe would be at ease.Walker 1987, p. 94. According to Leigh, she was forced to pay for her own shoes and demanded that MGM help her make some of the payments. On the other hand, MGM said that they bought all of Leigh's shoes and she didn't have to pay a penny on the film. Due to the dispute, her manager, Alexander Korda, sent Leigh a message stating that if her behaviour did not improve, he would not renew her contract. Leigh's behaviour did shape up and her contract was renewed.Walker 1987, p. 95. Some film historians believe A Yank at Oxford was instrumental in getting Vivien Leigh noticed by David O. Selznick for Gone with the Wind.Capua 2003, p. 43. Regardless of her prior behavior, Leigh managed to make her way through the filming of A Yank at Oxford without much additional acrimony and made an impression on her costar, Robert Taylor.Vickers 1988, p. 87. Taylor returned to Hollywood talking about the great English actress he had worked with and suggested to Selznick, who was still searching for his Scarlett O'Hara, that they ought to look at her.Walker 1987, p. 96. Reception A Yank at Oxford was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in The New York Times as a \\"pleasant spoof.\\" He wrote that the film \\"turns out to be an uncommonly diverting show. It can't be the story, for we've read the one about the old college spirit before. ... It must be the accents, the caps and gown, the cycles and the remarkably credible chaps Metro hired to play dean and tutor, scout and students. When the camera turns upon them you can jolly well smell the fog, you know.\\" The film review in Variety concentrated on Taylor's appeal. \\"Robert Taylor brings back from Oxford an entertaining rah-rah film which is full of breathless quarter-mile dashes, heartbreaking boat race finishes and surefire sentiment‚ÄîMetro's first British-made film under Hollywood supervision and with Hollywood principals and director.\\" A Yank at Oxford and A Yank at Eton (1942), portrayed the British in a mainly positive light, and set the scene for other films that were popular in both the United States and the United Kingdom during the war years.Glancy 1999, p. 59. The film was later parodied in the Laurel and Hardy film A Chump at Oxford (1940) and remade as Oxford Blues (1984) . =Box office= According to MGM records the film earned $1,291,000 in the US and Canada and $1,445,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $513,000.

It was composed of ordinary Malayan citizens of which the overwhelming majority were ethnically Chinese. The Min Yuen was under the direct control of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and actively supported the communist terrorists (CTs) with food, information, and medical supplies. Members of the Min Yuen were primarily located on jungle fringes and in villages and towns. Since the beginning of the Emergency, the British Government recognized the Min Yuen to be especially problematic. As the Min Yuen was made up of ordinary civilians, its members were indistinguishable from the rest of the population, making it impossible for security forces to instantly recognize and arrest communist them. Hence, the British Government found it imperative to isolate the Min Yuen as far as possible from the communist terrorists based in the jungle. This was achieved under the Briggs Plan with the implementation of New Villages starting in 1950.  Names  The term Min Yuen began appearing following the declaration of the Emergency in June 1948. It is the Romanization of the two-character abbreviated form of the Chinese term Minzhong Yuendong (Chinese: Ê∞ëÁúæÈÅãÂãï; pinyin: M√≠n zh√≤ng y√πn d√≤ng) which literally translates into ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Movement‚Äù.  History  = Membership Figures = In May 1948, at a security conference in Kuala Lumpur, Lieutenant Colonel John Dalley estimated that there were 5,000 members of the MNLA who had already taken up arms against the British government and 250,000 members of the Min Yuen and other MCP-affiliated organizations. In the early years of the Emergency from 1948 to 1951, the MNLA frequently attracted recruits from the Min Yuen to join their guerilla army. Many opposed colonial British rule and were inspired by the success of the Chinese Communist Party in defeating the Kuomintang in 1949. During the peak of the Emergency from late 1951 to early 1952, there were roughly 50,000 members of the Min Yuen. However, with the mass resettlement of nearly 500,000 Chinese squatters into New Villages by 1952, the Min Yuen were greatly hampered in their ability to meet with communist terrorists. The New Villages were located away from the jungle, had perimeter fencing, and guarded by Special Constables (and later the Home Guard). This made it difficult for communist sympathizers to freely meet and supply communist terrorists with food and information as well as for communist terrorists to terrorize and pressure the local community into providing them with support. By 1953, the full effects of Briggs‚Äô resettlement program had begun to be felt and the overall situation had improved drastically, and several mass arrests of Min Yuen members occurred. = Nature of Min Yuen Membership = Throughout the Emergency, the MCP failed to gain widespread support. Their only popular base was Malaya‚Äôs large yet unassimilated Chinese minority who accounted for 38% of the total population in 1947. Within the Chinese minority, Min Yuen membership can be categorized into two types: those who supported the MCP voluntarily and those who did so out of fear. Those who supported the MCP of their own volition tended to be members of the rural Chinese community. As a result of World War 2, there was severe economic dislocation in Malaya and many rural Chinese had lost their jobs. Many of them moved to fringes of the jungle, became squatters, and engaged in subsistence farming, while others took up jobs as tin miners or rubber tappers. Additionally, the MCP also enjoyed support from supporters of the MPAJA whom the MCP fought alongside with during the Japanese occupation of Malaya. Those who supported the MCP out of fear were the greater population-at-large, but especially the general Malayan Chinese community. For example, between June 1950 and April 1951 in a town where the MCP was heavily active, the Special Branch reported that many Chinese traders, lorry owners, bus company owners, and rubber estate owners had been extorted into paying protection money to the MCP, many times in fear of their own personal safety. Many members of the Min Yuen who were forced into supporting the MCP felt guilty for their actions. However, they reported that it was necessary and the lesser of two evils: if they were found out by authorities, the worst thing that could happen would be detainment. However, should they refuse to pay protection money to the communists, they risked the lives of themselves and their loved ones. The MCP also had a negative reputation for violence and terrorism. Between October 1945 and December 1947, communist terrorists performed 191 murders and abductions, and in the first six months of 1948 alone, there were 107. In the first week of June 1948, the month in which the Emergency was declared, there were 17 casualties in a riot involving 200 people. Perhaps the most notable act of communist terror would be the murder of British High Commissioner Sir Henry Gurney on October 6, 1951 where he was killed by chance in a routine ambush by communist terrorists. In doing so, the MCP created a sense of fear and aversion among the greater populace, greatly reducing their chances of recruiting new sympathizers to join the Min Yuen and achieving the popular revolution they had hoped for. = The Infiltration of Min Yuen by the Special Branch = Under the Briggs‚Äô Plan, the Special Branch was tasked with penetrating the Min Yuen and destroying the MCP from within. While the Special Branch did not manage to penetrate the upper ranks of the MNLA and MCP leadership hierarchy, they were successful in inserting undercover agents in the Min Yuen. In some scenarios, once the Special Branch had gathered sufficient information on known Min Yuen members, they would threaten to arrest and punish them under Emergency Regulations unless they agreed to cooperate. In other situations, the Special Branch would plant misinformation in the Min Yuen knowing that it would be passed on to communist terrorists as genuine, thereby destroying the credibility of the Min Yuen as a reliable source of intelligence.

Biography William Blaxton was born in Horncastle, Lincolnshire,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Reverend_William_Blaxton_plaque,_Boston,_MA_- _DSC00183.JPG England, the son of a minister. He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge as a sizar in 1614 and received an MA in 1621. He was ordained as a priest of the Church of England in May 1619 by Thomas Dove, Bishop of Peterborough. Blaxton joined the failed Ferdinando Gorges expedition to America in 1623, and he arrived in Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1623 on the ship Katherine as a chaplain in the subsequent expedition of Robert Gorges. Most of his fellow travelers returned to England in 1625, and he became the first colonist to settle in Boston, living alone there. The Puritans landed in nearby Charlestown in 1629 but they had problems finding potable water, so Blaxton invited them to settle on his land in Boston in 1630. They then granted him , but he sold it back to them in 1634, and this land now makes up Boston Common, a central public park in downtown Boston. William Blaxton plaque on Beacon Street across from Boston Common, his original farmland Plaque at Boston Common Blaxton purportedly did not get along with the leaders of the Boston church, so he moved about south of Boston to what the Indians called the Pawtucket River, today known as the Blackstone River in Cumberland, Rhode Island. He was the first settler in Rhode Island in 1635, one year before Roger Williams established Providence Plantations. The area that Blaxton settled was part of the Plymouth Colony until 1691, when it came under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts Bay Colony until 1741; it finally became part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He tended cattle, planted gardens, and cultivated an apple orchard, and he cultivated the first variety of American apples, the Yellow Sweeting. He called his home \\"Study Hill\\" and was said to have the largest library in the colonies at the time, but his library and house were burned during King Philip's War around 1675. Blaxton's friends included Narragansetts Miantonomi and Canonchet, and Wampanoags Massasoit and Metacomet. Metacomet is notoriously known today as King Philip, whose followers burned Blaxton's home to the ground. Roger Williams and Blaxton disagreed on many theological matters, but they remained lifelong friends. Williams frequently invited him to preach in Providence, and he also preached at other churches throughout Rhode Island. According to one modern journalist, he \\"is considered to be the pioneer clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States.\\" He married widow Sarah Fisher Stevenson in Boston on 4 July 1659 at the age of 64,Ancestry.com.

The ship was built by the State Dockyard between 1967 and 1969 for service with the Australian National Line, under the name MV Australian Trader. Initially operating on the Melbourne to Devonport run, Australian Trader was reassigned to the Sydney to Tasmania run in 1972. Passenger service on that run ended in 1976, and at the start of 1977, the vessel was purchased by the RAN for use as a training vessel and troop transport, and was renamed HMAS Jervis Bay. After decommissioning in 1994, the vessel was sold to Voyager Marine, and renamed MS Agios Andreas. After modifications to increase her passenger and vehicle capacity, Agios Andreas commenced ferry services between Greece and Turkey in 1995. In 2003, she was sold to Marwan Shipping and Trading, renamed MS Amjan Leader, and began operations in the Persian Gulf. The ship was renamed MS Amjan City in 2004, but was sold for scrapping later that year. Design and construction The vessel was built as Australian Trader for the Australian National Line by the State Dockyard in Newcastle.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 110 The vessel had a displacement of at standard load and at full load, a value and a value. The vessel was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Australian Trader was propelled by two 16PC2 Atlantique 2V400 Pielstick diesels, which supplied to the vessel's two propeller shafts, and allowed her to reach . The ship was also fitted with a Voith-Schneider bow thruster.Plowman, Ferry to Tasmania, p. 120 In her initial configuration, the ship could carry 190 passengers: 140 in single- or double-berth cabins, the rest in aircraft-style reclining chairs. 110 cars could be carried in covered parking, with room for an additional 15 in peak conditions, split between the cargo hold and the orlop deck. Larger vehicles (such as semi-trailers) or specially designed shipping containers could be stored on the open aft deck. A stern door allowed for the embarking and disembarking of vehicles. Public amenities onboard included an observation lounge, smoke room and bar, tavern, and a cafeteria (which initially sold only breakfast). Australian Trader was laid down on 18 August 1967, launched on 17 February 1969, and completed on 17 June 1969.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 111Sharped (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships 1992‚Äì93, p. 30 Operational history =Australian National Line= On entering service, Australian Trader was assigned to Bass Strait crossings between Melbourne and Devonport; the ship departed from Melbourne on her maiden voyage on 24 June 1969, then commenced paid services on 29 June.Latest ANL ferry joins Bass Strait services Freight & Container Transportation August 1969 page 17 In April 1972, the ferry was returned to the dockyard for modifications, prior to entering service on the Sydney to Tasmania route. Because of the longer run, more crew needed to be accommodated; this was achieved by extending the superstructure and converting some of the passenger cabins to crew use, in turn reducing the passenger complement to 172. Australian Trader fared poorly on the run: the service was dogged by bad reviews of the ship's design and amenities, while maritime union strikes disrupted service.Plowman, Ferry to Tasmania, pp. 125‚Äì6 In June 1976, Australian National Line announced plans to cease passenger service between Sydney and Tasmania, with replacement by a cargo-only service aboard Bass Trader.Plowman, Ferry to Tasmania, p. 126 Although due to cease operations on 3 July, delays in the completion of the new vessel kept Australian Trader in operation until the end of July, when she was laid up. =Royal Australian Navy= Starting on 6 October 1976, the RAN began to show interest in acquiring Australian Trader for use as a training ship and troop transport. The ship was sold to the RAN on 28 January 1977 for $5.7 million, and began $720,000 worth of modifications for naval service, which included the installation of a new navigation bridge and the refitting of some passenger cabins into classrooms. The vessel was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Jervis Bay on 25 August. Modification was not completed until January 1978. Jervis Bay replaced the destroyer in the training role, with Duchess decommissioning in October 1977.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 109 Jervis Bays primary role was to facilitate the seamanship and navigation training of officer cadets, with logistic transport of Australian Army soldiers and equipment seen as a back-up capability. In RAN service, the ship's company consisted of 14 officers and 163 sailors, with up to 76 trainees embarked at any time. The ship did not carry any fitted weapons, and relied on small arms for defence. The vessel's first training cruise occurred in February 1978. In December 1980, trials to mate Jervis Bay with the landing craft were successfully performed in Sydney Harbour. In 1987, the deckhouse was removed, and the ship's aft deck was strengthened to allow a single Sea King or similar helicopter; more extensive plans to allow the embarkation of a flight of six helicopters were shelved. In December 1992, Jervis Bay was deployed via Townsville to Mogadishu in support of 1RAR and the US-led Operation Restore Hope. Jervis Bay paid off on 18 April 1994.Straczek, The Royal Australian Navy =Post-military service= The ship was put up for sale in October 1994.Plowman, Ferry to Tasmania, p. 128 On 23 December, she was sold to Liberian company Voyager Marine, renamed to MS Agios Andreas, and registered to Kingstown, Saint Vincent. The ship sailed from Sydney on 14 January 1995; the voyage to Greece was made using the port engine only, as the starboard engine had been disassembled with the ship was to receive new engines in Greece. Once in Greece, Agios Andreas underwent major modifications including the installation of new engines from the ships to be scrapped, fire damaged Ionian Express, extension of the superstructure along the length of the hull; this and other modifications resulted in a passenger capacity increase to 1,120 (316 in cabins), vehicle capacity to grow to 300 cars, and the ship's gross tonnage to become . On completion, the ship began ferry services between Greece and Turkey, under the operation of Greek company Med Link Lines. In November 2003, the ship was sold to Marwan Shipping and Trading of Comoros, renamed MS Ajman Leader, and began operations in the Persian Gulf out of Dubai. In February 2004, ownership was transferred to Marwan Shipping and Trading of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, and the vessel was renamed MS Ajman City. In September 2004, Ajam City was sold to shipbreakers, and was taken to Alang, India, for scrapping.

Pascal was the first film producer to successfully bring the plays of George Bernard Shaw to the screen. His most successful production was Pygmalion (1938), for which Pascal received an Academy Award nomination as its producer. Later adaptations of Shaw plays included Major Barbara (1941), Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) and Androcles and the Lion (1952). Early life Pascal was born G√°bor LehelDukore, Bernard F., editor. Selected Correspondence of Bernard Shaw: Bernard Shaw and Gabriel Pascal. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996. p. xv. on June 4, 1894 in Arad, Transylvania, Austria- Hungary (now Romania). His wife wrote in her book on Pascal's relationship with Shaw that her husband's \\"origin was shrouded in a mystery which, I often suspected, he enjoyed thickening with contradictory remarks. When people tried to probe into his past, he had a tailor-made answer for each inquirer.\\" Pascal, Valerie, The Disciple and His Devil. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970. p. 59. He claimed to have been an orphan taken from a burning building as a child and raised first by Gypsies before being put into an orphanage. He also claimed that the Gypsies taught him to beg, steal, and do acrobatic tricks.Pascal, Valerie, The Disciple and His Devil. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970. p. 60 It is unclear what parts of his account of his childhood are true as there are no formal records of him before the age of 17 when he was enlisted in military school in Holics, Hungary (now Hol√≠ƒç, Slovakia), by a mysterious Jesuit priest. Pascal, who decidedly was unfit for military life, became interested in theatre and studied at the Academy of the Hofburgtheater in Vienna. Later, his interest expanded into the newly burgeoning cinema, and he made films in Germany and Italy with sporadic success. Becoming a teetotaler at an early age, he smoked cigars prodigiously, later provoking admonishments from George Bernard Shaw that he would ruin his voice. Pascal had one son, Peter, conceived in Germany with his landlady's sister Elsie, during the delirium of a fever. Unable to care even for himself, Pascal fled to the Netherlands. After World War II ended, Pascal returned to Germany to search for his son Peter, but he was listed among the missing Hitler-Jugend. Elsie had been killed by a bomb. Early career As a young man, Pascal found a job tending horses in Hungary. Leading the horses through the forest to a stream each day, Pascal developed the habit of riding naked and bareback through the Hungarian countryside. One day he accidentally rode stark naked through the outdoor set of a silent movie in production and was \\"discovered\\".Pascal, Valerie, The Disciple and His Devil. New York: McGraw- Hill, 1970. p. 64 The film's director asked him to repeat the ride for the cameras, and he joined the group. Soon he was making his own movies. Pascal had another auspicious encounter when he was young while walking along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. A much older man, George Bernard Shaw, was swimming naked holding onto a buoy. A conversation ensued, and Shaw dared the young Pascal on the shore to take off his clothes and join him in the water. He was impressed when Pascal immediately did so, and this began their friendship. Shaw enjoyed Pascal's youthful enthusiasm for art and his bravado, and invited him to visit him one day when he was broke.Pascal, Valerie, The Disciple and His Devil. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970. p. 67 This chance meeting was to play a major role in Pascal's later career. Pascal began his producing career making silent movies in Italy for German distribution through UFA Studios in Berlin. His directorial debut was Populi Morituri, in which he also starred. He later produced comedies in Germany. Meher Baba and India In 1934, during a trip to Hollywood, Pascal was contacted by Princess Norina Matchabelli (wife of the perfume manufacturer) about a film project based on the teachings of Meher Baba. Pascal became very interested in this project, bringing writers Hy KraftPascal (1970), The Disciple ... p. 70 and Karl Vollm√∂ller into helping him work up treatments and even making a trip to India to discuss the project further with Meher Baba. By the time Pascal arrived in India, however, Meher Baba did not seem in any hurry to complete the film, saying it could wait. He invited Pascal to travel with him in India. Most ordinary men would have been discouraged, but Pascal took energetically to the austere life of an eastern ascetic, even shedding his western garb for eastern clothing.Pascal (1970), The Disciple ..., p. 69‚Äì70 He took a liking to Meher Baba and maintained a correspondence with him for the rest of his life. Meher Baba nicknamed Pascal as his \\"Phoenix\\" and alternately his \\"Black Panther.\\"Pascal (1970), The Disciple..., p. 70Kalchuri, Bhau. Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba. Manifestation, 1986. p. 1890Awaken Magazine, Volume 18 Number 1, 1978 Pascal remained in close correspondence with his master Meher Baba until the end of his life; he met with him for the last time in 1952 in Scarsdale, New York.Kalchuri (1986) Meher Prabhu, p. 3877 Even in this final meeting, they discussed films which Pascal planned to produce for Meher Baba. Thirty years before Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi, Pascal had a written agreement with Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of India, to produce a movie of Gandhi's life.See Page 219 states that \\"Nehru had given his consent, which he confirmed later in a letter to Gabriel: 'I feel... that you are the man who can produce something worthwhile. I was greatly interested in what you told me about this subject [the Gandhi film] and your whole approach to it.\\" Collaborations with Shaw Pascal took a ship back from India to the United States, penniless but undaunted. He landed in San Francisco where he spent some time deciding what to do next. He decided to approach playwright George Bernard Shaw, whom he had met many years earlier. During that earlier meeting Shaw, who had been impressed with the young Pascal's passion for art and cinema, had told him to pay him a visit when he was entirely penniless. Pascal sought out Shaw, first by going to New York City hidden in the toilet of a railroad train, then convincing a sea captain to give him a lift to England. Somehow he convinced Shaw to give him the rights to his plays, beginning with Pygmalion (1938), which he released as a film. It was an enormous international hit, both critically and financially. Pascal tried to convince Shaw to let Pygmalion be turned into a musical, but the outraged Shaw explicitly forbade it, having had a bad experience with the operetta The Chocolate Soldier (based on Shaw's Arms and the Man). Pascal was the only person to convince Shaw to adjust his scripts to the new medium of cinema, gaining concessions from Shaw that no one else could. Pascal created the line for Pygmalion (later used by Lerner and Loewe in their musical version My Fair Lady) \\"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.\\" Shaw, who publicly was referring to Pascal as a genius, added the line into the script.Pascal (1970) The Disciple..., p. 83 In 1938, Pascal was named as one of the world's more famous men by Time magazine, along with Adolf Hitler and the pope. He followed the film Pygmalion with Major Barbara (1941), which he directed as well as produced. Major Barbara was filmed in London during aerial bombing by the Nazis. During air raids, the crew and cast had to dodge into bomb shelters. Pascal never stopped the production, and the film was completed on schedule. Pascal became more and more extravagant: Caesar and Cleopatra (1945), the next Pascal film of a Shaw play, was the most expensive British movie ever made at that time. It was a major financial and critical flop. Pascal insisted on importing sand from Egypt to achieve the right cinematic colors for the film. In this period, Shaw had become more difficult to work with. After the success of Pygmalion, which was shortened in its transition from stage to screen, the playwright increasingly refused to let his plays be cut. Shaw heightened his praise of Pascal during this period. He wrote in 1946: Pascal produced Androcles and the Lion (1952), but by this time he was suffering from cancer. Death Pascal died of cancer in July 1954.

Plot summary Following the Hellmouth's closure, hundreds of potential slayers have been awakened. Buffy Summers hoped that overturning the Slayer's self-sacrifice would result in her earning some relaxation following seven years of fighting. However, the victory is short- lived. Dark forces are arising to fill the gap left by the First. Willow's magical spell which sent slayer essence across the world has resulted in girls everywhere discovering a new power. The Scoobies travel to Europe. In London, Giles races to reorganize the remnants of the Watchers Council, hoping to overcome the shortcomings of its previous incarnation. Buffy, Xander, Willow, Dawn, and Dawn's new best friend, a young slayer named Belle travel to Rome to train new Slayers that are drawn to the infamous Immortal, Buffy is attracted to the Immortal, an ambiguous yet charismatic character, who she does not fully trust during the whole novel. They soon hear of an unknown \\"Queen of the Slayers\\" who is getting a number of the fresh slayers to form a mystical army. This likely evil seems determined to claim the slayer essence for herself, and viciously and cruelly murders any Slayers that don't cooperate with her and betray Buffy. Faith and Robin Wood take a group of Slayers to the Hellmouth in Cleveland, which has gone supernova with evil, to stabilize the hell there. They face many casualties, and experience strange projections of The Legion of Three, three deadly Hellgods. There are three factions of evils, two of them just want to defeat Buffy after she closed the Hellmouth, who want to kill Buffy, The so-called Queen of the Slayers who wants to destroy Buffy, along with her lover, Antonia Borgia (a sorcerer under the employ of The Immortal) and convinces newbie slayers that Buffy is just using them to gain power, and Two Vampire Sorcerers who live in the Borgia Hell Dimension, and The Legion of Three. Xander goes to Africa hoping to find more about the origins of the slayer essence. He discovers instead that the good in the world is not enough to fight the bad, and that the deciding confrontation is drawing far too near. It will be slayer against slayer, as an ultimate battle of champions approaches. Dawn goes into a coma, because she was The Key, and has a link to the Earth, which is crumbling because of the supernova Hellmouth in Cleveland, and the Hellgods who are breaking through the barrier. Willow also seems to go into a coma, but is somehow woken up by a kiss from her lover, Kennedy when she, Faith and Robin are called back to Rome, because of the non-ending battle in deserted Cleveland. Buffy, Willow, Kennedy, Belle, Vi, and Rona head to Brazil (under the orders of an angelic, Tara), to get The Death Orchid which has healing abilities, and they are attacked by The Queen of the Slayers. They are saved from poison darts by one of the rogue slayers, Haley, who realizes what she has done and gives them the antidote. They then go to Tibet, to meet with the infamous sorcerer, The Golden One, and re-meet Oz who is one of the werewolves that protect The Golden One. After the Golden One is killed, Oz and his wolf-pack decide to head to Rome, to help Buffy and her Slayers against the upcoming battle. After healing Dawn, Buffy goes on patrol along with Faith who meet a rogue Slayer who they believe is leading them into a trap, and their belief comes reality when she leads the Slayer sisters right into the hands of Ornella, the Queen of the Slayers and her demons. Buffy and Faith waste the demons easily and escape back to The Immortal's castle, where he betrays them, for power, knocks them out, and ties them up. Buffy, unconscious is visited by the good demon, Whistler. The Powers that Be have sent him to The Slayer for her to see the battle going on in L.A. that has Angel, a resurrected Spike, and their team fighting against the hell that Wolfram & Hart has sent upon them. Buffy cries tears of horror as she believes that both the vampires who loved her will die again. She is then joined by both Angel and Spike's souls, and together they create an angelic daughter with all of their features, who gives Buffy the strength she needs to wake up, gather her friends, her team, her Slayers, and defeat The Legion of Three. Buffy wakes up the morning after the battle, to find her friends building her funeral pyre believing her to be dead again. She finds her friends safe and sound, though Faith was forced to kill Slayers who wouldn't surrender. Buffy has a confidential conversation with Willow who reveals that she also saw Buffy's future daughter, Buffy looks into the sunset, declares her love for all of her friends (including Andrew), healing after the battle, and vows to see Angel, and Spike again. Continuity *Intended to be set after BtVS's seventh season, it takes place over the period of around a year immediately following \\"Chosen\\". *In the novel the characters discover that the First Slayer was named Senaya. This name is partially canon, as Willow refers to her by \\"Sineya\\" during her spell in \\"Restless\\". =Canonical Issues= Buffy/Angel novels such as this one are not usually considered canon by the fans. Some consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while others think of them as taking place in an alternate reality. However, these novels are not mere fan fiction, as overviews which summarize their plots are approved early on by both FOX and Joss Whedon (or at least his office). The books are then published as official Buffy/Angel merchandise. In the case of this particular book, Joss Whedon's canonical Buffy the Vampire Slayer season eight comics series appears to directly contradict the events laid out in this novel. Therefore, the series' events which Queen of the Slayers features, such as Buffy's relationship with The Immortal, are now considered to be non-canon. In the season eight comics, the Buffy that has a relationship with the Immortal is one of three plants. Three \\"Buffy's\\" are in various places, so no one knows who is the real one and who isn't because they are being hunted by the United States government.

For example why he was on a World War II sub (\\"Why We Fight\\"), and his earlier memories of the Scooby gang whilst he spied on them in \\"Reptile Boy\\". =Canonical issues= Buffy books such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as officially Buffy/Angel merchandise.

Given the matrices A and B,where A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2  2 & 0 & 1  5 & 2 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix} , \\\\quad B = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 4  3  1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, the augmented matrix (AB) is written as (AB)= \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 3 & 2 & 4  2 & 0 & 1 & 3  5 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. This is useful when solving systems of linear equations. For a given number of unknowns, the number of solutions to a system of linear equations depends only on the rank of the matrix representing the system and the rank of the corresponding augmented matrix. Specifically, according to the Rouch√©‚ÄìCapelli theorem, any system of linear equations is inconsistent (has no solutions) if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix; if, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has k free parameters where k is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions. An augmented matrix may also be used to find the inverse of a matrix by combining it with the identity matrix. To find the inverse of a matrix Let C be the square 2√ó2 matrix : C = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3  -5 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. To find the inverse of C we create (CI) where I is the 2√ó2 identity matrix. We then reduce the part of (CI) corresponding to C to the identity matrix using only elementary row operations on (CI). : (CI) = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 3 & 1 & 0 -5 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] : (IC^{-1}) = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & -\\\\frac{1}{5}  0 & 1 & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{15} \\\\end{array}\\\\right] , the right part of which is the inverse of the original matrix. Existence and number of solutions Consider the system of equations : \\\\begin{align} x + y + 2z &= 2  x + y + z &= 3  2x + 2y + 2z &= 6. \\\\end{align} The coefficient matrix is : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2  1 & 1 & 1  2 & 2 & 2  \\\\end{bmatrix}, and the augmented matrix is : (AB) = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 1 & 1 & 1 & 3  2 & 2 & 2 & 6 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. Since both of these have the same rank, namely 2, there exists at least one solution; and since their rank is less than the number of unknowns, the latter being 3, there are an infinite number of solutions. In contrast, consider the system \\\\begin{align} x + y + 2z &= 3  x + y + z &= 1  2x + 2y + 2z &= 5. \\\\end{align} The coefficient matrix is : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2  1 & 1 & 1  2 & 2 & 2  \\\\end{bmatrix}, and the augmented matrix is : (AB) = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  2 & 2 & 2 & 5 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. In this example the coefficient matrix has rank 2 while the augmented matrix has rank 3; so this system of equations has no solution. Indeed, an increase in the number of linearly independent rows has made the system of equations inconsistent. Solution of a linear system As used in linear algebra, an augmented matrix is used to represent the coefficients and the solution vector of each equation set. For the set of equations : \\\\begin{align} x + 2y + 3z &= 0  3x + 4y + 7z &= 2  6x + 5y + 9z &= 11 \\\\end{align} the coefficients and constant terms give the matrices : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3  3 & 4 & 7  6 & 5 & 9 \\\\end{bmatrix} , \\\\quad B = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0  2  11 \\\\end{bmatrix}, and hence give the augmented matrix : (AB) = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 0  3 & 4 & 7 & 2  6 & 5 & 9 & 11 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] . Note that the rank of the coefficient matrix, which is 3, equals the rank of the augmented matrix, so at least one solution exists; and since this rank equals the number of unknowns, there is exactly one solution. To obtain the solution, row operations can be performed on the augmented matrix to obtain the identity matrix on the left side, yielding : \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 4  0 & 1 & 0 & 1  0 & 0 & 1 & -2  \\\\end{array}\\\\right], so the solution of the system is (x, y, z) = (4, 1, -2).

Built by Incat in Tasmania and launched in 1997 as Incat 045, the ship was chartered to TT-Line as Tascat to supplement cross-Bass Strait services until the company acquired new ships. The catamaran remained laid up until 1999, when she was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy as a troop and equipment transport, becoming the first large catamaran to enter naval service. Jervis Bay operated in support of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce until May 2001, when she was decommissioned and returned to the builder. In 2002, the ferry was sent to Europe, operating briefly in the Mediterranean before being chartered by Speed Ferries for a cross-English Channel ferry service as HSC SpeedOne. She is now owned by Condor Ferries and is named HSC Condor Rapide. Construction The ship was laid down as Incat 045 in 1997, at Incat's shipyards in Hobart, Tasmania. She was launched in November 1997. The catamaran had not been ordered by any company. Four Ruston 20RK270 medium-speed diesels propel the catamaran at speeds of up to . Operational history =TT-Line= The ship's first period of service was on charter to TT-Line, for service between Melbourne, Victoria and Devonport, Tasmania. Named Tascat, the ship ran in conjunction with the first Spirit of Tasmania until the new ferries and entered service, at which point she was laid up. =RAN= After an increase in instability in nations near Australia, the Australian Defence Force sought to upgrade a second brigade-size group to activation on short notice.Morrison, Rixon, & Dudley, Chartering and HMAS Jervis Bay Delays in refitting the two Kanimbla class vessels acquired from the United States Navy several years earlier meant that the RAN's sealift capability had to be supplemented in order to support two brigades. The RAN sought a large, high-speed catamaran from either Incat or Australian Ships (later named Austal): both companies had vessels available, but only Incat was able to provide a ship before June 1999. A two- year bareboat charter was signed for Incat 045 in May 1999, and the vessel was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Jervis Bay on 10 June 1999. For military service, the catamaran was modified with enlarged fuel tanks to extend her range to and additional air conditioning units to improve equipment operational reliability in tropical climates. Sections of the vehicle deck were reinforced to support up to nine tons of weight per axle, allowing the vessel to transport most Australian Army vehicles. The catamaran's vehicle ramp was modified so it could be self-deployed, instead of requiring dock facilities. After modification, Jervis Bay could transport 500 troops, plus their equipment, supplies, and vehicles. In order to maintain a high operational tempo without personnel fatigue or burnout, two ships' companies of 20 (including 5 Army personnel responsible for the embarkment, storage, and disembarkment of Army personnel and equipment) were established; a practice later used by the RAN on patrol boats and survey ships. Because Jervis Bay was designed for short-haul voyages, crew and passenger facilities were limited: little potable water was carried, cooking facilities were minimal, and there were no sleeping facilities for the crew. Later modifications included the installation of additional water tanks, and the fitting of 20 bunks. HMAS Jervis Bay in Dili in October 1999 Based in Darwin after commissioning, Jervis Bay was in a fortuitous position to respond to the 1999 East Timorese crisis, and was used to provide logistic support to the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce. The catamaran was the first RAN ship to reach Dili; deploying 3RAR to the city's damaged docks on 12 September. Jervis Bay was then used to transport soldiers and equipment between Darwin and Dili: she was capable of sailing the in around 11 hours at an average speed of approximately .Polson, Navy goes Down Under, explores future of amphib warfare The catamaran was also used to transport humanitarian aid, and relocate displaced persons. During the two years of the ship's charter by the RAN, Jervis Bay made 107 trips between Darwin and East Timor, shipping 20,000 passengers, 430 vehicles and 5,600 tonnes of freight, becoming known as the \\"Dili Express\\".Hasik, Arms and Innovation, p. 82Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 290 Running the catamaran was found to be more efficient than using air transport to move materiel to and from East Timor, with the higher sailing speed meaning she could turn around a payload faster than multiple C-130 Hercules flights for an equivalent load. In March 2010, the ship was retroactively awarded the battle honour \\"East Timor 1999‚Äì2000\\".

Description 180px The great barred frog reaches a size of 8 centimeters and has large, powerful legs. It has a dark brown dorsal surface and a white ventral surface. The thighs are yellow blotched with black and it has parallel black bars along the legs. A dark line begins at the snout, passes through the eye and over the tympanum, and bends down behind the tympanum. Its feet are fully webbed and hands completely un- webbed. Its eyes are on top of the head and the tympanum is visible. Ecology and behaviour The great barred frog is a ground-dwelling frog which inhabits rainforests, Antarctic beech forests, or wet sclerophyll forests. This frog breeds in both streams and ponds, and it calls from the surrounding land. All the other frogs of the genus Mixophyes breed only in streams. The mating call is a very loud \\"wark-wark-wark\\" which is occasionally followed by a softer, slow trill \\"bwaaark-bwaaark\\". The male and female great barred frog will enter the water for amplexus. After laying the eggs, the female will flick them onto the bank for development. The eggs will then be washed into the stream or pond after the first rain and hatch into tadpoles. The great barred frog is almost always found near running water. Its powerful legs, and webbed feet allow it to escape predation by hopping large distances into water and quickly swimming away.

The , former Major League Baseball outfielder attended Fresno State University. Career A switch hitter who threw left- handed, Fox was taken in the 22nd round (566th overall) of the 1984 Major League Baseball draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He failed to sign and re- entered the draft. In 1985, the Philadelphia Phillies took him in the 13th round, 330th overall; again, he did not sign. Finally, in the 1986 draft, the Seattle Mariners took him fifth overall in the first round, and he signed with them. Fox spent three seasons in the Mariners organization before being released on March 29, 1989. On that same day, the Oakland Athletics quickly signed him. He spent the next few years in the Athletics' minor league system before making his Major League debut on July 7, 1992, at the age of 28. Fox's career highlight may have come on July 29, 1992, when Fox hit a game-winning, three-run home run against the Minnesota Twins. That win put the A's into a first place tie with the Twins and catapulted them towards the American League West Division title that season, while the Twins finished in second place, six games back of the A's. Many Twins fans blame that game and his home run for the downfall of the franchise through the rest of the 1990s, only one year removed from winning the World Series in 1991. The minor league speedster did not live up to his 49-steal potential in the Majors. In 116 career MLB games, he stole only five bases (in 1,178 minor league games, he stole 224 bases). His final big-league game was July 5, 1995, with the Texas Rangers. Throughout his big league career, he had a .198 batting average. After his final big league game, he still played minor league baseball until 1997, in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Phillies and Baltimore Orioles organizations. He has since coached in several organizations, notably the Florida Marlins and Arizona Diamondbacks systems, and spent 2013 as a coach for the Harrisburg Senators in the Washington Nationals' farm system.

Origin of name According to the tradition, the city is named after Radhan Khan, a descendant of Fateh Khan Baloch. Fateh Khan Baloch received a freedom from the Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah III, which included the territory of the later day city of Radhanpur. History Coat of arms of Radhanpur State Muhammad Jalal ud-din Khan, Nawab of Radhanpur, (1889-1936) Radhanpur belonged to the Vaghelas and was known as Lunavada after Vaghela Lunaji of the Sardhara branch of that tribe. Subsequently, it was held as a fief under the Gujarat Sultanate, by Fateh Khan Baloch, and is said to have been named Radhanpur after Radhan Khan of that family. Babi ancestors either entered India accompanying Mughal emperor Humayun or entered the service of Sultan Muzaffar III of Gujarat Sultanate (1561 - 1572). Bahadur Khan Babi was, in the reign of Shah Jahan, appointed manager of Tharad, and his son Sher Khan Babi made manager, thanadar, of Chunval in 1663. Their descendants controlled various villages around Radhanpur from 1693 to 1730 as Mughal fief. In 1743, Babi descendant Jawan Mard Khan II took over viceroyalty of Ahmedabad and controlled several villages in North Gujarat. He was defeated by Maratha Gaekwads in 1753 at Ahmedabad and Gaekwads agreed to his demand of control of villages in North Gujarat. His descendants lost some of these villages to Gaekwads subsequently. In 1813, Sher Khan made a treaty with the Gaekwar and British and became British protectorate. His descendants ruled the state until independence of India in 1947.The last ruler of Radhanpur state was His Highness Nawab Murtuza Khan Babi Bahadur.And His Highness was entitled with Hereditary 11 Gun salute. Radhanpur State was under Palanpur Agency of Bombay Presidency, which became part of Banas Kantha Agency in 1925. Bombay Presidency was reorganised as Bombay State after independence. In 1960, Gujarat was formed from Bombay State and Radhanpur fell under its Banaskantha district. Geography and Climate Radhanpur is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Radhanpur It has an average elevation of 27 metres (88 feet). Demographics India census, Radhanpur had a population of 50001. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Radhanpur has an average literacy rate of 80%, higher than the national average of male literacy is and female literacy is 60%. In Radhanpur, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. Places of interest Carved Wooden houses from the palace of nawab of Radhanpur The town was surrounded by a part stone part brick loopholed wall fifteen feet high, eight feet broad, and about two and a half miles round, with corner towers, eight bastioned gateways, outworks and a ditch in past. There is also, surrounded by a wall, an inner fort or castle, called Rajghadi, where the Nawab used to live.
