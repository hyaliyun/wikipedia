Biography Regina Holm√©n was the daughter of Swedish born, Lutheran pastor, Johannes Algott Holm√©n (1859‚Äì1948) and his second wife, Amelia. She obtained two degrees simultaneously in 1922 at Augustana College, in Rock Island, Illinois, in music and English, and studied at Juilliard graduating in 1927 with a diploma in organ. She was a teacher in the music department at Augustana College, where she taught piano, organ, music theory, and French. She also taught piano and organ at Black Hawk College in Moline, and Knox College in Galesburg. Her work was distinguished by her research into Scandinavian and German musical sources (particularly J. S. Bach) for Lutheran hymnody and liturgy, and the success with which she incorporated these sources into a form suitable for the use of modern American congregations. She was responsible for the Setting Two of the Service Book and Hymnal of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, on which she worked between 1948 and 1958. It was called the \\"Continental Setting\\" because it reflected the Lutheran liturgy from Northern Europe, including Sweden. Fryxell also wrote the settings of the Bach Sanctus in First Setting and the Danish Amen in Setting 2. She was also commissioned to work between 1974 and 1977 on the updated Setting Three of the successor publication, the Lutheran Book of Worship; the commissioning Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship (ILCW) body however failed to honor the terms of the commission.Sucha, Lutheran Book of Worship 21 Years Later Personal life She was the wife of the geologist Fritiof Fryxell who also taught at Augustana College. The Fryxells had three sons including the geologist Roald H. Fryxell. Two of their children died at young ages.

For C.S. Forester, publishing with Michael Joseph, Biro made cover illustrations of several first editions: Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, Lieutenant Hornblower, Hornblower and the Atropos, Hornblower in the West Indies and Randall and the River of Time. In 1965 for Hamish Hamilton he illustrated the first edition of Angler's Moon by Leo Walmsley. He also illustrated covers for Radio Times. Gumdrop The real-life Gumdrop as driven by the author on 27 July 2008 Gumdrop is the name of an Austin Clifton Heavy Twelve-Four of 1926, the title character of a series of books authored by Val Biro, who owned an example. The stories revolve around the car and his owner, initially the younger Bill McArran, but for most of the series, the more senior Mr Oldcastle (later joined by a dog, Horace). The plots often involve the search for replacement parts for Gumdrop. Biro wrote the stories from the late 1960s to the 1980s. The main series of books, all fully illustrated in colour by Biro, ran to at least seventeen titles, with a further twelve (at least) \\"Gumdrop Little Books\\" also published in the 1980s. Whilst Gumdrop's adventures are fictional, the car is not. Biro and Gumdrop were frequent visitors to car shows and other events in Sussex and surrounding area.

For this reason it is sometimes described as Pre-Roman Iberian sculpture. Almost all extant works of Iberian sculpture visibly reflect Greek and Phoenician influences, and Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences from which those derived; yet they have their own unique character. Within this complex stylistic heritage, individual works can be placed within a spectrum of influences- some of more obvious Phoenician derivation, and some so similar to Greek works that they could have been directly imported from that region. Overall the degree of influence is correlated to the work's region of origin, and hence they are classified into groups on that basis. The Levantine Group The Bicha of Balazote The sculptures that comprise the Levantine group were mostly made between the 5th century B.C. and the period of Roman domination; this group is best represented in museum collections. The most famous among them is the bust known as The Lady of Elche, which displays evident Greek influence. Works in this style number over 670; though there are stylistic differences, which testify to the successive influences of conquering peoples. More visibly oriental references, possibly influenced by the Egyptian sphinx and the Assyrian Lamassu, are evident in the various stone sculptures in the form of sphinxes, bulls, or lions found in the area of Valencia, Alicante, and Albacete. They include: * The Bicha of Balazote, or the man-bull * The Sphinx of Agost, in Alicante, and that of Salobral (Albacete), which guards the Louvre Museum, though mutilated. * The Lioness of Bocairent (Valencia), in the Provincial Museum of Valencia * The Lion of Coy in Murcia * The Lions of Baena (C√≥rdoba), which are similar to the previous ones * The Deer of Caudete (Albacete) or the Lady of Caudete The The numerous statues of bronze (some of silver) found in two places of the region of Sierra Morena in the province of Ja√©n can be considered to be more indigenous derivatives of the initial, Greek and oriental- influenced, Levantine sculptural style. In the period between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD, sanctuaries like Montealegre used small bronze castings, rather than stone carvings, as votive offerings. These sculptures were cast from earthen molds in molten bronze in the technique of lost wax casting, but since the mold was rendered useless after only one casting, two identical works have yet to be found amongst these sculptures. Approximately 4,000 sculptures in this style have been excavated, depicting Iberian warriors, riders, religious celebrants, small horses, and body parts. A great deal of Greek and Punic statues and busts in Terra cotta, together with various amulets in ivory, metal or carved of thin stone, have been uncovered at the necropolis of Ibiza, La Palma, and Formentera. The oldest have been dated to the 8th century B.C., and they most likely continued to be made up to the Roman domination. These include: * The Lady of Ibiza * Praying Terracotta Figurines (3rd century BC) Pieces also considered to be of Phoenician or Punic origin but with Greek influence include the bronze heads of bulls (probably votive offerings) found in Majorca. A very early Phoenician piece from Galera depicts a seated female, perhaps Astarte, flanked by sphinxes. * The Lady of Galera The Southern Group The Lady of Baza The southern group is principally composed of sculptures found in sepulchers, and other funeral monuments, in the Andalusian region. Most of them display heavy Phoenician influence. They are as follows: * The sculptural set of Cerrillo Blanco * the sculptural set of The Pajarillo * The Punic stela of Villaricos (Almeria), of conical form and with Phoenician inscription * The Lady of Baza. * The plates and combs of ivory with reliefs of Carmona's necropolis. * The anthropomorphic sarcophagus carved in marble with the figure of the deceased, of the Greek style, found in Cadiz * The amulets with figurines of Egyptian style found in sepulchers of Cadiz and M√°laga * several other reliefs of the Phoenician or Iberian tradition but worked already with Roman influence, discovered in Osuna (such as the Bull of Osuna) The Western Group The western group is composed of granite funeral stelae from Portugal and Galicia that represent foot soldiers dressed in tunics and armed with round shields. These sculptures are relatively coarsely worked. Some of them bear Roman inscriptions, which were probably added long after the figures were carved.  The Central Group  The Bulls of Guisando In the center of the Peninsula, between the rivers Douro and Tagus there are many granite sculptures roughly carved in the form of bulls, or perhaps some other animal. Some of these also have Roman inscriptions, which again were probably added later. The most famous of these monuments are the four known as the Bulls of Guisando. Archeologists consider them to be works of the same culture that carved the sphinxes of the Levantine region. See also *South- Western Iberian Bronze *Iberian schematic art References * VV.AA.

Around 1 in every 3,500 babies in the United States contract the infection. Signs and symptoms Neonatal herpes manifests itself in three forms: skin, eyes, and mouth herpes (SEM) sometimes referred to as \\"localized\\", disseminated herpes (DIS), and central nervous system herpes(CNS). * SEM herpes is characterized by external lesions but no internal organ involvement. Lesions are likely to appear on trauma sites such as the attachment site of fetal scalp electrodes, forceps or vacuum extractors that are used during delivery, in the margin of the eyes, the nasopharynx, and in areas associated with trauma or surgery (including circumcision). * DIS herpes affects internal organs, particularly the liver. * CNS herpes is an infection of the nervous system and the brain that can lead to encephalitis. Infants with CNS herpes present with seizures, tremors, lethargy, and irritability, they feed poorly, have unstable temperatures, and their fontanelle (soft spot of the skull) may bulge. CNS herpes is associated with higher morbidity, while DIS herpes has a higher mortality rate. These categories are not mutually exclusive and there is often overlap of two or more types. SEM herpes has the best prognosis of the three, however, if left untreated it may progress to disseminated or CNS herpes with its attendant increases in mortality and morbidity. Death from neonatal HSV disease in the U.S. is currently decreasing; The current death rate is about 25%, down from as high as 85% in untreated cases just a few decades ago. Other complications from neonatal herpes include prematurity with approximately 50% of cases having a gestation of 38 weeks or less, and a concurrent sepsis in approximately one quarter of cases that further clouds speedy diagnosis. CauseRisk factors= Maternal risk factors for neonatal HSV-1 include: White non-Hispanic race, young maternal age (<25), primary infection in third trimester , first pregnancy, HSV (1&2) seronegative, discordant partner, gestation <38 weeks, receptive oral sex in third trimester. Neonatal HSV-2 maternal risk factors: Black race, young maternal age (<21), discordant partner, primary or non primary first episode infection in third trimester, four or more lifetime sexual partners, lower level of education, history of previous STD, history of pregnancy wastage, first viable pregnancy, gestation <38 weeks. =Transmission= The majority of cases (85%) occur during birth when the baby comes in contact with infected genital secretions in the birth canal, most common with mothers that have newly been exposed to the virus (mothers that had the virus before pregnancy have a lower risk of transmission), an estimated 5% are infected in utero, and approximately 10% of cases are acquired postnatally. Detection and prevention is difficult because transmission is asymptomatic in 60% - 98% of cases. Treatment Reductions in morbidity and mortality are due to the use of antiviral treatments such as vidarabine and acyclovir. However, morbidity and mortality still remain high due to diagnosis of DIS and CNS herpes coming too late for effective antiviral administration; early diagnosis is difficult in the 20-40% of infected neonates that have no visible lesions. A recent large scale retrospective study found disseminated NHSV patients least likely to get timely treatment, contributing to the high morbidity/mortality in that group. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, recommends that pregnant women with active genital herpes lesions at the time of labor be delivered by caesarean section. Women whose herpes is not active can be managed with acyclovir.Ch. 6, \\"Medical Disorders during Pregnancy,\\" in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed., 2005 The current practice is to deliver women with primary or first episode non primary infection via caesarean section, and those with recurrent infection vaginally, even in the presence of lesions because of the low risk (1-3%) of vertical transmission associated with recurrent herpes. Epidemiology Neonatal HSV rates in the U.S. are estimated to be between 1 in 3,000 and 1 in 20,000 live births. Approximately 22% of pregnant women in the U.S. have had previous exposure to HSV-2, and an additional 2% acquire the virus during pregnancy, mirroring the HSV-2 infection rate in the general population. The risk of transmission to the newborn is 30-57% in cases where the mother acquired a primary infection in the third trimester of pregnancy. Risk of transmission by a mother with existing antibodies for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 has a much lower (1-3%) transmission rate. This in part is due to the transfer of significant titer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus from about the seventh month of pregnancy. However, shedding of HSV-1 from both primary genital infection and reactivations is associated with higher transmission from mother to infant. HSV-1 neonatal herpes is extremely rare in developing countries because development of HSV-1 specific antibodies usually occurs in childhood or adolescence, precluding a later genital HSV-1 infection. HSV-2 infections are much more common in these countries. In industrialized nations, the adolescent HSV-1 seroprevalance has been dropping steadily for the last 5 decades. The resulting increase in the number of young women becoming sexually active while HSV-1 seronegative has contributed to increased HSV-1 genital herpes rates, and as a result, increased HSV-1 neonatal herpes in developed nations. Recent study in the United States from 2003‚Äì2014, using large administrative database show increasing trends in incidence of neonatal HSV from 7.9 to 10 cases per 100,000 live births and mortality of 6.5%. Decreasing gestational age, African American race had higher incidence of neonatal HSV. After this can add another study from Canada showed similar results .. incidence of 5.9 per 100,000 live births and case fatality of 15.5%. A recent three-year study in Canada (2000‚Äì2003) revealed a neonatal HSV incidence of 5.9 per 100,000 live births and a case fatality rate of 15.5%. HSV-1 was the cause of 62.5% of cases of neonatal herpes of known type, and 98.3% of transmission was asymptomatic. Asymptomatic genital HSV-1 has been shown to be more infectious to the neonate, and is more likely to produce neonatal herpes, than HSV-2, However, with prompt application of antiviral therapy, the prognosis of neonatal HSV-1 infection is better than that for HSV-2.

Retrieved 30 January 2012 is a 2010 Franco-German-British political thriller film directed by Roman Polanski. The film is an adaptation of a 2007 Robert Harris novel, The Ghost, with the screenplay written by Polanski and Harris. It stars Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Kim Cattrall, and Olivia Williams.IMDb: The Ghost Writer main details. Retrieved 30 January 2012 The film was a critical and commercial success and won numerous cinematic awards including Best Director for Polanski at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and also at the 23rd European Film Awards in 2010. Plot A ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) is hired by publishing firm Rhinehart, Inc. to complete the autobiography of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). The writer's predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where Lang and his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) are staying in a harshly modernistic mansion, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall), and staff. Amelia forbids the writer from taking McAra's manuscript outside, emphasising that it is a security risk. Shortly after the writer's arrival, former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) accuses Lang of authorising the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over to be tortured by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the United States (or one of the few other countries that do not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in Washington, D.C., the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's. During a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man (Eli Wallach) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but she later fell down the stairs and lapsed into a coma. Later, Ruth admits to the writer that Lang had never been very political and until recently always took her advice. When the writer tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to \\"clear her head\\". Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before the latter's death. The writer and Ruth have a one night stand while Adam is away. The next morning, the writer takes the BMW X5 McAra used on his last journey. Unable to cancel the pre-programmed directions on the car's sat-nav, he decides to follow them. He arrives in Belmont, Massachusetts at the home of Professor Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson). Emmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer's showing him two pictures of the pair among photographs found in McAra's possessions, as well as pointing out a more recent one on the wall of Emmett's study. When the writer tells Emmett the sat-nav proves McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive. The writer leaves and successfully eludes a car that is pursuing him. He boards the ferry back to Martha's Vineyard, but when he sees the pursuit car drive aboard, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock. With no one else to turn to, the writer redials Rycart's number and asks for help. While waiting, the writer researches Emmett, and finds links between Emmett's think tank and a military contractor. He also finds leads connecting Emmett to the CIA. When Rycart arrives, Rycart reveals McAra gave him documents linking Lang to so-called \\"torture flights\\", in which terrorist suspects were placed on private jets owned by Emmett's company to be tortured while airborne. Rycart further claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in the \\"beginnings\\" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The writer discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, while Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests. When the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on his return flight by private jet, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett. Lang derides his suggestions. Upon leaving the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British retired soldier whose son died \\"in one of Lang's illegal wars\\". The assassin is in turn shot dead by Lang's bodyguards. Nevertheless, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of Lang's death it will be a certain best-seller. Amelia invites the writer to the book's launch party in London, where she unwittingly tells him the Americans tightened access to the book, as the \\"beginnings\\" contained evidence threatening national security. She also tells him Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was a Fulbright scholar at Harvard. The writer realizes the clues were hidden in the original manuscript, in the opening words of each chapter, and discovers the message: \\"Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.\\" He concludes Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the United States under direction from the CIA. The writer passes a note to Ruth revealing his discovery. She unfolds the note and is devastated. She sees the writer raising a glass to her but is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. The writer leaves the party and attempts to hail a taxi, without success. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction, and a thud is heard. Witnesses react in horror, and the pages containing McAra's manuscript scatter in the wind. The film ends, leaving the writer's fate unconfirmed.

The character is linked to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and the special relationship with the United States. The author of the book on which the film is based has said he was inspired at least in part by anger toward Blair's policies, and calls for him to face war crimes trials. Robert Pugh, who portrayed the former British Foreign Secretary, Richard Rycart, and Mo Asumang, who played the US Secretary of State, both physically resemble their real-life counterparts, Robin Cook and Condoleezza Rice. Like the fictional Rycart, Cook had foreign policy differences with the British Prime Minister. The old man living on Martha's Vineyard is a reference to Robert McNamara. Hatherton Corporation alludes to real-life Halliburton.

Recurrences usually last a few days or a few weeks, and resolve without treatment. They may recur weekly or monthly for approximately 5 years following primary infection. Diagnosis Although DNA analysis techniques such as polymerase chain reaction can be used to look for DNA of herpesviruses in spinal fluid or blood, the results may be negative, even in cases where other definitive symptoms exist.

It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 500,000 individuals per year, and some studies suggest an incidence rate of 5.9 cases per 100,000 live births. About 90% of cases of herpes encephalitis are caused by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), the same virus that causes cold sores. 57% of American adults are infected with HSV-1, which is spread through droplets, casual contact and sometimes sexual contact, though most infected people never have cold sores. The rest of cases are due to HSV-2, which is typically spread through sexual contact and is the cause of genital herpes. Two thirds of HSE cases occur in individuals already seropositive for HSV-1, few of whom (only 10%) have history of recurrent orofacial herpes, while about one third of cases results from an initial infection by HSV-1, predominantly occurring in individuals under the age of 18. Approximately half of individuals who develop HSE are over 50 years of age. Signs and symptoms Most individuals with HSE show a decrease in their level of consciousness and an altered mental state presenting as confusion, and changes in personality. Increased numbers of white blood cells can be found in patient's cerebrospinal fluid, without the presence of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Patients typically have a fever and may have seizures. The electrical activity of the brain changes as the disease progresses, first showing abnormalities in one temporal lobe of the brain, which spread to the other temporal lobe 7‚Äì10 days later. Imaging by CT or MRI shows characteristic changes in the temporal lobes (see Figure). Definite diagnosis requires testing of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for presence of the virus. The testing takes several days to perform, and patients with suspected Herpes encephalitis should be treated with acyclovir immediately while waiting for test results. Atypical stroke-like presentation of HSV encephalitis has been described as well and the clinicians should be aware that HSV encephalitis can mimic a stroke. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332427377_An_Unusual_Stroke- Like_Presentation_of_HSV_Encephalitis = Associated conditions = Herpesviral encephalitis can serve as a trigger of Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Pathophysiology HSE is thought to be caused by the transmission of virus from a peripheral site on the face following HSV-1 reactivation, along a nerve axon, to the brain. The virus lies dormant in the ganglion of the trigeminal cranial nerve, but the reason for reactivation, and its pathway to gain access to the brain, remains unclear, though changes in the immune system caused by stress clearly play a role in animal models of the disease. The olfactory nerve may also be involved in HSE, which may explain its predilection for the temporal lobes of the brain, as the olfactory nerve sends branches there. In horses, a single-nucleotide polymorphism is sufficient to allow the virus to cause neurological disease; but no similar mechanism has been found in humans. Diagnosis Brain CT scan (with/without contrast). Complete prior to lumbar puncture to exclude significantly increased ICP, obstructive hydrocephalus, mass effect Brain MRI‚ÄîIncreased T2 signal intensity in frontotemporal region ‚Üí viral (HSV) encephalitis Treatment Herpesviral encephalitis can be treated with high-dose intravenous acyclovir, which should be infused 10 mg/kg(adult) over 1 hour to avoid kidney failure. Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in approximately 70% of cases; survivors suffer severe neurological damage. When treated, HSE is still fatal in one-third of cases, and causes serious long- term neurological damage in over half of survivors. Twenty percent of treated patients recover with minor damage. Only a small population of untreated survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function. Many amnesic cases in the scientific literature have etiologies involving HSE. Earlier treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) improves the chances of a good recovery. Rarely, treated individuals can have relapse of infection weeks to months later. There is evidence that aberrant inflammation triggered by herpes simplex can result in granulomatous inflammation in the brain, which responds to steroids. While the herpes virus can be spread, encephalitis itself is not infectious. Other viruses can cause similar symptoms of encephalitis, though usually milder (Herpesvirus 6, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, etc.).

Its pronunciation resembles the word for \\"harmony\\" (, h√©xi√©), in reference to the \\"harmonious society\\", to which the Chinese leadership professes to aspire, and which Chinese internet censors use to justify internet censorship.Wines. 11 March 2009 As a result, when a post on a microblog is deleted, the censorship notice says that the post has been \\"harmonized\\" (, h√©xi√©), which is pronounced similar to \\"river crab\\" (, h√©xi√®) in Mandarin Chinese, so the netizens say that the post has been eaten by the \\"river crab\\". The term \\"crab\\" itself is rural slang, meaning \\"a bully who uses power through force\\", and the \\"river crab\\" has become a symbol of crude censorship backed with the threat of force. The river crab is often depicted wearing three wristwatches, since Â∏¶‰∏â‰∏™Ë°® (d√†i sƒÅn ge bi«éo, \\"wears three watches\\") sounds similar to (SƒÅng√® D√†ibi«éo), the ideology of the \\"Three Represents\\", an interpretation of communism promoted by former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.University of Pompeau Fabria, Barcelona. p.2.

A cartoon about the Grass Mud Horse attracted a quarter million views, and a nature documentary on its habits received 180,000 more hits in the same amount of time. Even though some Grass Mud Horse videos were not technically blocked by Chinese censors, some had their sound blocked, with a message saying \\"This video contains an audio track that has not been authorized by WMG.\\"Xiaohe1120xu Yazhou Zhoukan () reported that Zhan Bin, a teacher at the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology,Parker created a new Chinese character by fusing the three Chinese character radicals for \\"grass\\", \\"mud\\", and \\"horse\\".

In March 2011, \\"Grass Mud Horse\\" themed merchandise, such as plush dolls, began being sold over the Internet.Daddytypes.com One Guangzhou toy manufacturer reportedly produced its first batch of 150 Grass Mud Horse cuddly toys with official birth certificates issued by Mahler Gebi Mystical Creatures Bureau. The animals come in brown and white, named \\"Male\\" () and \\"Gebi\\" () respectively, and sell for 40 yuan each. To accompany these, a user's and feeding manual have been created.Nandu Daily Whereas they were called 'Caonima' before the crackdown, Internet sellers now list them using the correct Chinese term, (Alpaca). In 2009, renowned artist Ai Weiwei published an image of himself nude with only a 'Caonima' hiding his genitals, with a caption \\"ËçâÊ≥•È©¨Êå°‰∏≠Â§Æ\\" (\\"c«éon√≠m«é d«éng zh≈çngyƒÅng\\", literally \\"a Grass Mud Horse covering the center\\". One interpretation of the caption is: \\"fuck your mother, Communist Party Central Committee\\". Political observers speculated that the photo may have contributed to Ai's arrest in 2011 by angering Chinese Communist Party hardliners.  Grass Mud Horse Day  In 2012, Chinese netizens started to designate the date 1 July as the \\"Grass Mud Horse Day\\". The date coincides with the \\"Party Day\\" in China which is to celebrate the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.  Political discourse  The China Digital Times sees Caonima as the \\"de facto mascot of netizens in China fighting for free expression, inspiring poetry, photos and videos, artwork, lines of clothing, and more.\\" It is an illustration of the \\"resistance discourse\\" of Chinese internet users with \\"increasingly dynamic and sometimes surprising presence of an alternative political discourse: images, frames, metaphors and narratives that have been generated from Internet memes [that] undermine the values and ideology that reproduce compliance with the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian regime, and, as such, force an opening for free expression and civil society in China.\\" Caonima is an expression of a broader Chinese internet culture of spoofing, mockery, punning, and parody known as e'gao, which includes video mash-ups and other types of bricolage.Christopher Rea, ‚ÄúSpoofing (e‚Äôgao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.‚Äù In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149-172. Censorship The Beijing Television Cultural Center fire led to Chinese internet users creating a number of photoshopped parodies, including one with a Caonima's outline in the smoke. On 20 March 2009, the New York Times reported that a Chinese contributor to Global Voices Online posted a message from an Internet administrator to managers of online bulletin boards warning that \\"any content related with Grass-Mud Horse should not be promoted and hyped\\" because \\"the issue has been elevated to a political level ... The overseas media has exaggerated the incident as a confrontation between netizens and the government.\\"Wines. 20 March 2009Global Voices In a press conference on 25 March, the Foreign Ministry confirmed that China's access to YouTube had been officially blocked since two days earlier. According to Reporters Without Borders, the block was an attempt to stem videos showing Chinese repression of the Tibetan population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising of 10 March 1959, and to block access to the popular Grass Mud Horse video posted in early March.Government blocks access to YouTube, Reporters Without Borders, 25 March 2009 The State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television issued a directive on 30 March 2009 to highlight 31 categories of content prohibited online, including violence, pornography, and content which may \\"incite ethnic discrimination or undermine social stability\\". Many netizens believe the instruction follows the official embarrassment over the rise of the \\"Grass Mud Horse\\" phenomenon. Industry observers believe that the move was designed to stop the spread of parodies or other comments on politically sensitive issues in the runup to the 20th anniversary of the 4 June Tiananmen Square protests. Following the government's directive, most Chinese essays and blog postings made about the Grass Mud Horse have been removed from the Internet after being discovered by government censors. Some of these citizen efforts to keep the Grass Mud Horse alive have moved offshore to the U.S. and elsewhere, including for example the creation of an independent Canadian publishing house (see Mudgrass Press) referencing the meme. The Caonima reappeared as a subject of online cartoon satire following the announcement of the Green Dam Youth Escort pornography blocking software project.  Grass Mud Horse as a Trickster  The trickster figure is a character found across the study of myth, folklore religion as a type of archetypal character across cultures. The trickster figure is characterised by intelligence and a trait for playing with social norms and taboos often enticing or deceiving others into breaking rules. Tricksters therefore might avoid stricture by authorities or figures in power even to the extent of making those authorities look foolish. For these reasons the anthropologist James Cuffe has called the Grass Mud Horse an example of an online trickster- mythic and duplicitous in nature. Rather than the Grass Mud Horse being simply subversive in the face of internet censorship Cuffe proposes the trickster as a liminal character that carries a cultural function as a heuristic device; This allows the audience to 'reevaluate their own experiential understanding against that of their communities. By framing itself against and in spite of limits the trickster offers new coordinates by which one can reassess and judge one's own experiences.' In the case of China this can be the communication of the experience of censorship to those who have not experienced censorship but can come to understand it as something that happens within their community through shared stories.

They can also be found in north-western and central regions. Bali Aga people that are referred to as Bali Pergunungan (Mountain Balinese) are those that are located at Trunyan village. For the Trunyan Bali Aga people, the term Bali Aga (Mountain Balinese) is regarded as an insult with an additional meaning of \\"the mountain people that are fools\\"; therefore, they prefer the term Bali Mula (lit Original Balinese) instead. Origin The original inhabitants of Bali are said to have come from Bedulu village long before the Hindu-Javanese immigration wave. The legend is, there lived the last king of the Pejeng (an old Balinese kingdom), Sri Aji Asura Bumibanten, who had supernatural powers. He could cut off his head without feeling pain and put it back on again. One day, though, his head accidentally fell into a river and was swept away. One of his servants panicked and decided to quickly decapitate a pig and replace the king's head with the animal's head. Embarrassed, the king hid in a tall tower, denying any visitors. A small child discovered the secret and since then, the king became known as Dalem Bedulu, or He-who-changed-head. Another explanation is that the name comes from the name Badahulu or \\"the village upstream\\". After the Pejeng kingdom, the Majapahit Empire rose to power. Culture The Bali Aga live in isolated areas in the mountains. Their relative isolation compared to the lowland Balinese had preserved some of the original Austronesian element, apparent in the Bali Aga architecture. Tourists wishing to visit certain villages must be careful due to the geography of the area. While visiting, it is also important to be respectful and quietly observe the preserved way of life the Bali Aga have. In Tenganan, where tourism is more easily embraced and the people are said to be more friendly, a three-day festival called Udaba Sambah is held during the months of June or July. Tenganan prohibits divorce and polygamy, unlike other villages. Language The Bali Aga speak their own dialect of the Balinese language. It dates back thousands of years and varies from village to village; the version spoken in the Tenganan village is different from the Trunyan village. Craftwork An important part of Bali Aga culture is the complex tie-dye technique used to make Bali's traditional geringsing double ikat. Bali's Tenganan village is the only village that today still produces geringsing. In geringsing, both the cotton warp and weft threads are carefully dyed and cross-dyed before weaving; the finished pattern only emerges as the cloth is woven. According to textile expert John Guy, \\"the ancestry of Balinese geringsing is far from clear, although some cloths display the unmistakable influence of patola\\",Guy, John, Indian Textiles in the East, Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 13 the silk double ikats produced in Gujarat during the height of the Spice Trade (16-17C). Many of these imported cloths became inspiration for later locally-made textiles, but one theory is that the Balinese-made cloths were exported to India and copied there for production to Asian markets. Many have unique Hindu motifs such as a bird's eye view of a mandala with a sacred center from which everything radiates. Others feature designs clearly inspired by patola, for example a design known as the frangipani flower (jepun).Guy, p. 96. The palette of geringsing is typically red, neutral, and black. Geringsing are regarded as sacred cloths, \\"ascribed supernatural properties, especially to assist in forms of healing, including exorcism.\\"Guy, p. 96. Gering means decease and sing means no.

The final 1967 line-up consisted of Robyn Yorke and Janet Baily on drums, Pauline Moran on bass guitar, Eileen Woodman on keyboards, Barbara Thompson on saxophone and Beryl Marsden on vocals. The final line-up was Eileen, Robyn, Pauline and a Swedish guitarist named Inger Jonnsson. The band dissolved in 1970/71. Eileen Woodman went on to play keyboards with Billy Connolly and Gerry Rafferty in the Humblebums, Pete Brown's Flying Tigers (previously The Battered Ornaments) and also did a stint as keyboard player/vocalist with Tinkerbells Fairydust (at that time known as The Rush). Pauline Moran went on to be an actress on stage and in film and television, including playing the part of Miss Lemon in Agatha Christie's Poirot with David Suchet from 1989 to 2002, and again in 2013.

A large invasion force was prepared and put to sea from Dunkirk in February 1744, only to be partly wrecked and driven back into harbour by violent storms.Longmate p.144 Deciding that circumstances were not favourable to an invasion, the French government suspended the attempt, and deployed their forces elsewhere.Rodger p.244 The failure of the 1744 invasion attempt played a major role in the planning of the next French attempt to invade Britain, in 1759, which also proved unsuccessful. Background Britain had been at war with France's ally Spain since 1739, but despite widespread expectations France had not entered the war on Spain's side. Sporadic fighting in the Americas had broken down into a stalemate. A separate war had broken out on continental Europe regarding the Austrian Succession in which Britain and Spain were also on opposite sides and in which France remained initially neutral. It was clear to many in both countries that war between them could not be far off, and the British had been particularly alarmed by extensive fortifications in the French port of Dunkirk. British and French troops had already fought in Europe at battles such as Dettingen and the two countries were in a state of de facto war by late 1743. In January 1744 the French King Louis XV formally declared war on Britain. His Ministers were convinced that a strong, immediate strike was needed against Britain and began advocating an invasion of the British Isles. British financial subsidies were essential to keeping its continental allies Austria, Hanover and the Dutch Republic afloat. France believed that by invading Britain and knocking them out of the war, they could pave the way to an easy victory over their enemies to the east. Preparations for the invasion had been ongoing for some time before the declaration of war and Minister of the Marine Maurepas had detailed his trusted and highly competent First Commissioner Joseph Pellerin to prepare for it. Many flat-bottomed troop ships were built and provisioned in the northern ports under the Pellerin's direction. The King strongly approved this plan. Preparations Marshal Saxe was given command of French land forces for the invasion. The French planned to install the Jacobite James Edward Stuart in London as James III. He would end Britain's involvement in the war, and would turn Britain into a client state of Louis XV's government. The Anglo-Austrian Alliance would be terminated, as would Britain's alliance with the Dutch. This would reverse Britain's past successful policy of forming Grand Alliances against France on the continent through military support and financial subsidies. James, who was living in exile in a French palace in Paris, was made aware of these plans. It was hoped that Jacobite supporters in the British navy and army would assist the French. In some cases this proved wildly optimistic, as the officers listed as being committed Jacobites were often not or had already deceased.Rodger p.244 France now gathered a force estimated at somewhere between 6-15,000 in size at Dunkirk under the command of Marshal Saxe.Longmate p.148 Britain had been expecting a French invasion since as far back as 1740, when there had been an invasion scare, but the country was wary of the concept of standing armies and had limited regular forces to defend Great Britain. The French planned for a landing at Maldon in Essex. A squadron under Roq would sail from Brest, checking that the Channel between Dunkirk and the English coast was clear of the British fleet. A message would then be sent to Saxe's invasion force at Dunkirk, informing them that the crossing was feasible. British agents in Rome and Paris got word of these preparations, and steps were taken to prepare. Of the 10,000 active troops in Britain, 7,000 were deployed to defend London and South East England. Invasion attempt George Wade was to have commanded British troops resisting the invasion. The covering squadron under Rocquefeuil sailed from Brest on 26 January. The French had made a mistake, believing that Norris's larger British fleet was in Portsmouth when it was in fact sitting off The Downs. When Rocquefeuil arrived off Dungeness on the 27 February he spotted Norris' fleet and hastily retreated. Norris pursued, but a violent storm suddenly descended ‚Äì saving Rocquefeuil's squadron, which managed to avoid total destruction, although it was caught in the middle of the worst of the storm.Rodger p.244 The main invasion fleet had sailed days before, made up mostly of transport ships. This expedition soon ran into a fierce storm. Twelve French transport ships were sunk, seven of which went down with all hands.Longmate p.149 The others were severely damaged and forced to limp back into Dunkirk. A week later the French fleet arrived in Brest severely battered by the storms. The British ships had been able to run swiftly into nearby harbours, and had escaped the storms' worst damages. The French government could not see any immediate prospect of a successful second attempt, and the troops were badly needed elsewhere. Saxe's force were removed from the expedition, and instead marched into Flanders to fight the Dutch and Hanoverians. Many were happy to return to what they saw as a more conventional form of soldiering, after the terrors of their seaborne voyage.Longmate p.149 Aftermath The following year a much smaller force was landed by France in northern Scotland to support the Jacobite rising which had broken out, led by Charles Edward Stuart. When Stuart reached Derby, France agreed to send a much larger invasion force to support them ‚Äì but this decision was taken too late. By the time such an expedition was ready, Stuart had withdrawn to Scotland and the rebellion was ended with the Battle of Culloden in 1746 after which the French invasion plans were shelved for the remainder of the war. In 1759 the Duc de Choiseul became captivated with the idea of a single strike to knock Britain out of the war. He revisited the plans for an invasion on the south coast of England with other landings across the British Isles. He became convinced that the 1744 invasion had failed, like the Spanish Armada, partly because of the complex attempt to combine both a large fleet of warships, with the invasion force carried in transports. His plan was to move an invasion force swiftly from Le Havre to Portsmouth, without fleet protection, and end the Seven Years' War. He rejected Dunkirk as the site of the invasion partly because of the experiences of 1744. Ultimately this attempt failed, as did further French planned invasions in 1779 and 1804.

Approach to making capital budgeting decisions involves the average accounting return (AAR). There are many different definitions of the AAR. However, in one form or another, the AAR is always defined as: Some measure of average accounting profit divided by some measure of average accounting value. The specific definition we will use is: Average net income divided by Average book value. It is kinds of decision rule to accept or reject the finance project. For decide to these projects value, it needs cutoff rate. This rate is kind of deadline whether this project produces net income or net loss. There are three steps to calculating the AAR. First, determine the average net income of each year of the project's life. Second, determine the average investment, taking depreciation into account. Third, determine the AAR by dividing the average net income by the average investment. After determine the AAR, compare with target cutoff rate. For example, if AAR determined is 20%, and given cutoff rate is 25%, then this project should be rejected. Because AAR is lower than cutoff rate so this project will not make sufficient net income to cover initial cost. Average accounting return(AAR) does have advantages and disadvantages. Advantages; It is easier to calculate than other capital budgeting decision rules. It only needs net income data and book values of the investment during its life. Another advantage is needed information will usually be available. Disadvantage; it does not take time value of money into account. When we average figures that occur at different times, we are treating the near future and the more distant future in the same way. Therefore, there is no clear indication of profitability. Also the use of an arbitrary benchmark cutoff rate is a disadvantage. The last disadvantage is it is based on accounting net income and book values, not cash flows and market values.

Symptoms typically include a burning pain followed by small blisters or sores. The first attack may also be accompanied by fever, sore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes. The rash usually heals within 10 days, but the virus remains dormant in the trigeminal ganglion. The virus may periodically reactivate to create another outbreak of sores in the mouth or lip. The cause is usually herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and occasionally herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The infection is typically spread between people by direct non-sexual contact. Attacks can be triggered by sunlight, fever, psychological stress, or a menstrual period. Direct contact with the genitals can result in genital herpes. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms but can be confirmed with specific testing. Prevention includes avoiding kissing or using the personal items of a person who is infected. A zinc oxide, anesthetic, or antiviral cream appears to decrease the duration of symptoms by a small amount. Antiviral medications may also decrease the frequency of outbreaks. About 2.5 per 1000 people are affected with outbreaks in any given year. After one episode about 33% of people develop subsequent episodes. Onset often occurring in those less than 20 years old and 80% develop antibodies for the virus by this age. In those with recurrent outbreaks, these typically happen less than three times a year. The frequency of outbreaks generally decreases over time. Terminology The term labia means \\"lip\\". Herpes labialis does not refer to the labia of the genitals, though the origin of the word is the same. When the viral infection affects both face and mouth, the broader term orofacial herpes is used, whereas herpetic stomatitis describes infection of the mouth specifically; stomatitis is derived from the Greek word stoma, which means \\"mouth\\". Signs and symptoms Herpes infections usually show no symptoms; when symptoms do appear they typically resolve within two weeks. The main symptom of oral infection is inflammation of the mucosa of the cheek and gums‚Äîknown as acute herpetic gingivostomatitis‚Äîwhich occurs within 5‚Äì10 days of infection. Other symptoms may also develop, including headache, nausea, dizziness and painful ulcers‚Äîsometimes confused with canker sores‚Äîfever, and sore throat. Primary HSV infection in adolescents frequently manifests as severe pharyngitis with lesions developing on the cheek and gums. Some individuals develop difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Primary HSV infections in adults often results in pharyngitis similar to that observed in glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis), but gingivostomatitis is less likely. Recurrent oral infection is more common with HSV-1 infections than with HSV-2. Symptoms typically progress in a series of eight stages: #Latent (weeks to months incident-free): The remission period; After initial infection, the viruses move to sensory nerve ganglia (trigeminal ganglion), where they reside as lifelong, latent viruses. Asymptomatic shedding of contagious virus particles can occur during this stage. #Prodromal (day 0‚Äì1): Symptoms often precede a recurrence. Symptoms typically begin with tingling (itching) and reddening of the skin around the infected site. This stage can last from a few days to a few hours preceding the physical manifestation of an infection and is the best time to start treatment. #Inflammation (day 1): Virus begins reproducing and infecting cells at the end of the nerve. The healthy cells react to the invasion with swelling and redness displayed as symptoms of infection. #Pre-sore (day 2‚Äì3): This stage is defined by the appearance of tiny, hard, inflamed papules and vesicles that may itch and are painfully sensitive to touch. In time, these fluid-filled blisters form a cluster on the lip (labial) tissue, the area between the lip and skin (vermilion border), and can occur on the nose, chin, and cheeks. #Open lesion (day 4): This is the most painful and contagious of the stages. All the tiny vesicles break open and merge to create one big, open, weeping ulcer. Fluids are slowly discharged from blood vessels and inflamed tissue. This watery discharge is teeming with active viral particles and is highly contagious. Depending on the severity, one may develop a fever and swollen lymph glands under the jaw. #Crusting (day 5‚Äì8): A honey/golden crust starts to form from the syrupy exudate. This yellowish or brown crust or scab is not made of active virus but from blood serum containing useful proteins such as immunoglobulins. This appears as the healing process begins. The sore is still painful at this stage, but, more painful, however, is the constant cracking of the scab as one moves or stretches their lips, as in smiling or eating. Virus-filled fluid will still ooze out of the sore through any cracks. #Healing (day 9‚Äì14): New skin begins to form underneath the scab as the virus retreats into latency. A series of scabs will form over the sore (called Meier Complex), each one smaller than the last. During this phase irritation, itching, and some pain are common. #Post-scab (12‚Äì14 days): A reddish area may linger at the site of viral infection as the destroyed cells are regenerated. Virus shedding can still occur during this stage. The recurrent infection is thus often called herpes simplex labialis. Rare reinfections occur inside the mouth (intraoral HSV stomatitis) affecting the gums, alveolar ridge, hard palate, and the back of the tongue, possibly accompanied by herpes labialis. A lesion caused by herpes simplex can occur in the corner of the mouth and be mistaken for angular cheilitis of another cause. Sometimes termed \\"angular herpes simplex\\". A cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a cold sore, with topical antiviral drugs. Causes Herpes labialis infection occurs when the herpes simplex virus comes into contact with oral mucosal tissue or abraded skin of the mouth. Infection by the type 1 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is most common; however, cases of oral infection by the type 2 strain are increasing. Specifically, type 2 has been implicated as causing 10‚Äì15% of oral infections. Cold sores are the result of the virus reactivating in the body. Once HSV-1 has entered the body, it never leaves. The virus moves from the mouth to remain latent in the central nervous system. In approximately one-third of people, the virus can \\"wake up\\" or reactivate to cause disease. When reactivation occurs, the virus travels down the nerves to the skin where it may cause blisters (cold sores) around the lips, in the mouth or, in about 10% of cases, on the nose, chin, or cheeks. Cold sore outbreaks may be influenced by stress, menstruation, sunlight, sunburn, fever, dehydration, or local skin trauma. Surgical procedures such as dental or neural surgery, lip tattooing, or dermabrasion are also common triggers. HSV-1 can in rare cases be transmitted to newborn babies by family members or hospital staff who have cold sores; this can cause a severe disease called neonatal herpes simplex. The colloquial term for this condition, \\"cold sore\\" comes from the fact that herpes labialis is often triggered by fever, for example, as may occur during an upper respiratory tract infection (i.e. a cold). People can transfer the virus from their cold sores to other areas of the body, such as the eye, skin, or fingers; this is called autoinoculation. Eye infection, in the form of conjunctivitis or keratitis, can happen when the eyes are rubbed after touching the lesion. Finger infection (herpetic whitlow) can occur when a child with cold sores or primary HSV-1 infection sucks their fingers. Blood tests for herpes may differentiate between type 1 and type 2. When a person is not experiencing any symptoms, a blood test alone does not reveal the site of infection. Genital herpes infections occurred with almost equal frequency as type 1 or 2 in younger adults when samples were taken from genital lesions. Herpes in the mouth is more likely to be caused by type 1, but (see above) also can be type 2. The only way to know for certain if a positive blood test for herpes is due to infection of the mouth, genitals, or elsewhere, is to sample from lesions. This is not possible if the afflicted individual is asymptomatic. The body's immune system typically fight the virus. Prevention The likelihood of the infection being spread can be reduced through behaviors such as avoiding touching an active outbreak site, washing hands frequently while the outbreak is occurring, not sharing items that come in contact with the mouth, and not coming into close contact with others (by avoiding kissing, oral sex, or contact sports). Because the onset of an infection is difficult to predict, lasts a short period of time and heals rapidly, it is difficult to conduct research on cold sores. Though famciclovir improves lesion healing time, it is not effective in preventing lesions; valaciclovir and a mixture of acyclovir and hydrocortisone are similarly useful in treating outbreaks but may also help prevent them. Acyclovir and valacyclovir by mouth are effective in preventing recurrent herpes labialis if taken prior to the onset of any symptoms or exposure to any triggers. Evidence does not support L-lysine. Treatment Despite no cure or vaccine for the virus, a human body's immune system and specialty antigens typically fight the virus. Docosanol, a saturated fatty alcohol, is a safe and effective topical application that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for herpes labialis in adults with properly functioning immune systems. It is comparable in effectiveness to prescription topical antiviral agents. Due to its mechanism of action, there is little risk of drug resistance. The duration of symptoms can be shortened a bit if an antiviral, anesthetic, zinc oxide or zinc sulfate cream is applied soon after it starts. Effective antiviral medications include acyclovir and penciclovir, which can speed healing by as much as 10%. Famciclovir or valacyclovir, taken in pill form, can be effective using a single day, high-dose application and is more cost effective and convenient than the traditional treatment of lower doses for 5‚Äì7 days. Epidemiology Herpes labialis is common throughout the world. A large survey of young adults on six continents reported that 33% of males and 28% of females had herpes labialis on two or more occasions during the year before the study. The lifetime prevalence in the United States of America is estimated at 20‚Äì45% of the adult population. Lifetime prevalence in France was reported by one study as 32% in males and 42% in females. In Germany, the prevalence was reported at 32% in people aged between 35 and 44 years, and 20% in those aged 65‚Äì74. In Jordan, another study reported a lifetime prevalence of 26%. Research Research has gone into vaccines for both prevention and treatment of herpes infections.

India is represented in Liberia through its embassy in Abidjan (Ivory Coast) and an active honorary consulate in Monrovia since 1984. Liberia was represented in India through its resident mission in New Delhi which subsequently closed due to budgetary constraints.  Strategic cooperation  Bilateral relations have traditionally been strong and cordial with Liberia's full-fledged support for India‚Äôs aspiration for permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council. In recent years, both nations have developed close and extensive cooperation in trade, military and strategic fields. India sent the first all-women police unit of the UNMIL peacekeeping force to Liberia in 2007, with further batches arriving in the following years. The Indian government has taken a proactive role in creating new models of community and service-oriented policing in Liberia. In particular, India's CRPF has facilitated Liberian women's involvement in the National Police Service and law enforcement.  Commercial and economic relations  There are more than fifty Indian companies operating in Liberia, from small trading firms to steel magnates. In 2006, the PIO firm ArcelorMittal was awarded the large LIMINCO iron ore mine against an investment of $930 million over a twenty-year period. Recently, the Liberian government, which in September 2008 had disqualified Tata Steel from the bidding process for the $1.6 billion-Western Cluster iron ore project, has cleared the Indian steel major for the upcoming auction. With intensive Indian lobbying, Tata Steel's bid has been rated very high and favorably on technical, financial and social terms by the international consultancy firm Deloitte & Touche, engaged by the Liberian government. Moreover, the expanding Taurian group is negotiating for iron ore, gold and chromite mining concessions. This reflects India's diplomatic strategy of focusing on raw material security, especially in the West African region. Amidst India's growing role in Liberia, the Liberian Minister of Mines and Energy, Dr. Eugene Shannon visited India in October 2005 to participate in the Confederation of Indian Industry-Africa Conclave. In 2008, the President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was invited to visit India. Major items of Indian exports include engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, two wheelers, transportation equipment, steel and plastic products. Major items of imports are gold, diamonds, timber and metal scrap. Following lifting of UN sanctions, timber concessions have been awarded to Indian firms. Overall, Indian investments in Liberia have been increased from US$450 million in 2005 to an estimated $2 billion in 2009. The Indian Ambassador Shamma Jain has stated that she is committed to building strategic partnerships at all levels of government and facilitating new strategies for bilateral cooperation. In this regard, Ambassador Jain is moving quickly to intensify India‚Äôs relations with Liberia in the agricultural sector with the implementation of model agricultural projects with the help of scientists at the Indian Center of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In February 2009, Liberia's Agriculture Minister Dr. J. Chris Toe & Ambassador Jain discussed possible areas of support including emergency assistance to the Liberian agricultural sector amidst the caterpillar infestation in the country.

The DB Classes V 160 (later 216), 215, V 162 (later 217), V 164 (later 218), V 169 (later 219) and DB Class 210 comprise the family, being supplemented by the DBAG Classes 225 and 226, formed from original rebuilt machines. They are formed the backbone of non-shunting locomotive diesel traction in Germany up to the 1990s, and continued to do so along with the Class 232 locomotives of the former Deutsche Reichsbahn in the 2000s. DB locomotives The first post-postwar diesel heavy-duty locomotives, such as the DB Class V 200, had two engines of 800/980 kW each. That concept proved very expensive in maintenance; therefore, in the mid-1950s, construction began for a medium-duty single engine locomotive. = Class 216: The first V 160 = In 1960, the first production run of ten units was manufactured, each with one 1,320 kW engine. The name comes from its engine power in horsepower‚Äì1600 hp, V standing for Verbrennungsmotor.For more details see DB locomotive classification and DRG locomotive classification Maximum speed was either (depending on the setting of the two speed hydraulic transmission). Various lightweight materials and construction methods were employed to keep the weight below 80 t. From 1963 to 1969, two-hundred and fourteen Class 216 locomotives were manufactured. They were used both for passenger and freight service. Heating for passenger coaches was made available by a steam boiler. =Class 215= From the original Class 216, the Class 215 was derived, with an increased speed of (slow gear for freight trains at 100 km/h). The other parameters were largely unchanged, but the length was increased by 400 mm in order to make a later conversion to Class 218 possible. A total of 150 units of this class were produced. Many transferred to DB Cargo, and now are numbered as DBAG Class 225. =Class V 162 (Class 217)= As the heating of passenger cars was changing from steam to electricity, another variant with an additional auxiliary engine for electrical production was produced: the Class 217. Only 15 of these units were produced, the single engined Class 218 had far fewer components and so was built in preference. Maximum speed was and the power output was 1,320 kW plus auxiliary engine. =Class V 164 (Class 218)= 218 450 in Goslar After some testing in class 215 units, a stronger engine with 1,840 kW (later increased to 2,060 kW) was approved for rail service. Power for supply of electricity by generator could be taken directly from this more powerful main engine. The result was Class 218, with some 410 units built between 1971 and 1979; these became the backbone of diesel traction at Deutsche Bahn AG. Class 218 locomotives were used for any type of train, from intercity trains to heavy freight trains. Where necessary, double or triple traction was possible. Maximum speed was 140 km/h (100 km/h in low gear) and all locomotives were equipped with a hydraulic braking system. A subclass 218.9 was formed from rebuilt Class 210s, with the auxiliary gas turbine removed. =Class V 169 (Class 219)= Derived from Class 216 was one single unit with an additional gas turbine; Class V 169 (later Class 219). The class number 219 was reused after the merger of Deutsche Bahn and the Deutsche Reichsbahn for the East German DR Class 119, no Class V 169s having survived at that point. =Class 210= A faster variation was the Class 210, with a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Similar to a class 218 and developed using the gas turbine experience from the Class V 169; eight Class 210 units were equipped with a gas turbine used as a booster. The gas turbines were not fuel efficient and after two turbine failures all were removed and the Class 210 units were renumbered as Class 218.9. DBAG locomotives The units inherited from the former Deutsche Bundesbahn continued to be essential to the railways of Germany after the merger of the two railway companies. As part of the restructuring of the Deutsche Bahn, and in response to changing requirements, several new classes and sub-classes were formed in this era. =DBAG Class 225= Units transferred to DB Cargo, formed of both rebuilt Class 215s (forming the majority of the class) and Class 218 locomotives (forming the subclass 225.8). =DBAG Class 226= These units were converted for towing and shunting operations of passenger stock by the addition of Scharfenberg couplers. Private locomotives Starting from around the early 2000s Deutsche Bahn began to withdraw some of its V 160 family from service, some locomotives were scrapped, others were bought by private rail operators, some used 'as is', others were heavily modified, such as DH 1504.  Outlook  Most class 215 and class 216 units are no longer in service, although some were reconstructed and now serve private railway companies. The Class 217 units are still used for freight trains around M√ºhldorf as of 2008. It has not been decided yet how to replace the aging class 215 and class 218 units. However, an ever increasing number of passenger trains are being changed from locomotive/passenger coach type to modern DMU units, so the class 218's role in passenger service is decreasing. In freight service, former East German Class 232 units have taken over many trains. Nevertheless, some Class 218 units are refitted and are now numbered as Class 218.8.

It is the first of a series of romance novels known as the Rutshire Chronicles, which are set in the fictional English county of Rutshire. The story focuses on the lives of a group of top show jumping stars and follows the ups and downs of both their personal and professional lives. It was turned into a television film, Riders (1993), directed by Gabrielle Beaumont for Anglia Television and broadcast on the ITV Network. On 5 November 2019 BBC News included Riders on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Plot Set against the backdrop of the English Cotswolds countryside, Riders follows the fortunes of a group of fame and money hungry show jumping stars. Jake Lovell, the gypsy-born hero of the novel, is a brilliant horseman desperately seeking revenge for years of bullying at the hands of the glamorous but brutish aristocrat Rupert Campbell- Black. With the help of his rich debutante wife, Tory Maxwell, he is able to set himself up his own yard and begins building a reputation on the show- jumping circuit. Meanwhile, Rupert is content living the jet-set lifestyle with best friend Billy Lloyd-Foxe, plus a string of beautiful women, horses and dogs. Meeting his beautiful wife, Helen Macaulay, does little to curb his promiscuity and he eventually falls back into a life of parties, alcohol, and casual sex. When Jake and Rupert meet again for the first time since school, old rivalries are reawakened as they fight it out to prove who is the greater horseman and, perhaps more importantly, the greater lover. Along the way, Cooper gives us a peek into the lives of this close-knit community of tops riders, their horses, grooms and families. We see the highs and lows of life in the equestrian world, but who will eventually come out on top in the final showdown at the Los Angeles Olympics, and will success ultimately lead to disaster for Jake? Cover When first published in 1985 the book's cover, somewhat controversially, depicted ‚Äúa man‚Äôs hand resting intimately on the seat of a woman‚Äôs jodhpurs.‚Äù The 2015 30th anniversary edition's toned-down cover artwork moved the male hand from where it was firmly gripping the female rider's bottom to a much higher position nearer to her hip, generating some backlash from fans.

However, the Japanese were arguably using guns more effectively than their European counterparts by the sixteenth century, as well as producing more accurate, durable varieties. The Battle of Nagashino, where guns tore through charging samurai cavalry, is one of the most famous and influential battles in the history of the samurai. Ashigaru thumb The ashigaru were the lowest rank of soldier in feudal Japan, were formed as militia units during times of conflict. The arrival of guns in Japan in 1543 greatly increased the capability of the ashigaru units on the battlefield. Prior to the introduction of firearms, these men would often have to wield polearms and spears like yari or learn to fight with swords and bows. The matchlock, or tanegashima (gun) by comparison was easier to use. It did not rely on physical strength or regular practice to be effective.

Early years The Daly ancestors were the O'Dalys of County Galway, Ireland. In 1814, two years before Daly's birth, his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Omagh, County Tyrone, Ireland. Daly was born in New York City, New York, USA. His father, Michael, had been a master carpenter in Ireland, but in New York City, he worked as the manager of a hotel on Broadway. His mother, Elizabeth, died when Daly was age three. Michael remarried. Daly attended private school in his early years. Upon his father's death, Daly was unwilling to rely on a widowed stepmother, leading him to leave school and earn a living. He worked first as a clerk in Savannah, Georgia, before becoming a cabin boy on a trading ship. During his three years as a sailor, he was present at the 1830 capture of Algiers. When he returned to New York in 1832, he became a mechanical trade apprentice for a quill manufacturer. He also joined The New York Literary Society where he learned how to debate. This led to him becoming a law student and he was admitted to practice law in 1839. Career In 1843, Daly was elected to the New York State Assembly, representing the Fourth Ward of New York City.Pinther 2003, p. 3 While in office, he staunchly supported the establishment of Central Park against considerable opposition. The following year, Judge William Inglis' term on the New York Court of Common Pleas expired. On a recommendation of Governor William Marcy, Governor William Bouck appointed Daly to the Court, beginning his term May 1844. When the position changed from an appointed one to an elected one in 1847, Daly ran for election and won, eventually becoming Chief Justice.Brooks 1896, p. 26 One of his most notable cases dealt with the Astor Place Riot involving William Charles Macready at the Astor Place Theatre. He served on the court for six consecutive terms, retiring December 30, 1885 because of the constitutional age limit. Ten years later, the Court of Common Pleas was abolished, the judges becoming justices of the New York Supreme Court. For fifteen years, starting in 1860, he lectured on law at Columbia Law School. In 1867, Daly was a member of the New York Constitutional Convention. After leaving the bench, he became a partner in the firm of Daly, Hoyt and Mason. InterestsAmerican Geographical Society= Called an \\"armchair explorer\\" by some, Daly was elected as an Ordinary Member to the American Geographical Society on February 16, 1855,Pinther 2003, p. 4 to the Governing Board in 1858, and to its presidency in 1864, a position he held until his death in 1899. As a member, and then president of the AGS, Daly was influential in supporting Arctic expeditions. Daly, a bibliophile, had a personal collection of more than 12,000 volumes. He donated 700 of his geographical books to the AGS on his 75th birthday and during his tenure as President, helped with the AGS's library collection expansion. =Other memberships= He was an honorary member of the Royal Geographical Society of London, England, the Berlin Geographical Society, and Russia's Imperial Geographical Society. In London in 1895, he was a speaker at the 6th International Geographical Congress. In his early career years, he was a member of the New York Literary Society, the Law Association, Democratic Republican Young Men of the City and County of New York (vice-president), and New York Workingmen's Democratic Republican Association (recording-secretary). Later, Daly was a member of the New York Historical Society, the American Philosophical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Century Association, St. Patrick's Society (president), and Committee for the Relief of Ireland (chairman). Daly became a member of the Peary Arctic Club shortly before his death; the Daly Range in Greenland was named after him by Robert Peary. Personal life Daly met Maria Lydig in 1855. Born in 1824, Maria was the daughter of Philip Mesier Lydig, Esq. (1739‚Äì1872) of New York. Philip Lydig was the last holder of the land that subsequently became the Bronx Park; the park now contains the New York Botanical Garden. Her mother, Katherine, was the eldest daughter of John Suydam, a Knickerbocker. Like Daly, Maria was a Democrat and a Unionist. They married September 27, 1856 in West Farms, Westchester County, New York. At age 37, Maria began writing a diary, published as Diary of a Union lady, 1861-1865. She was active in the Democratic Party, the Women's Central Association for the Relief for the Army, and the New York Botanical Garden. She died at their summer home in North Haven, New York (near Sag Harbor) on August 21, 1894. Like his wife, Daly died in North Haven in 1899, rather than at their home in New York City at 84 Clifton Place. His funeral service was held at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. The home in North Haven passed on to Maria's niece, Emma Hoyt. Daly's papers, military record, lectures and diaries were donated to the New York Public Library by Emma. A portrait of Daly, painted by Daniel Huntington, hangs at the courtroom of what was the New York Court of Common Pleas.

It was originally raised as the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment in 1940 and in this guise it served in North Africa and the Middle East at the beginning of the war, before it was brought back to Australia and sent to New Guinea in late 1942 to serve against the Japanese. In mid-1943 the Australian high command decided to disband the divisional cavalry regiments and use their headquarters elements to administer the independent companies that had been raised earlier in the war. In the process the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment disbanded its squadrons, gave up their vehicles and changed its name to the 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment, as it became the administrative headquarters for the 2/3rd, 2/5th and 2/6th Commando Squadrons. History The 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment was formed in April 1940 as the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Hopkins. Consisting of a headquarters squadron and three sabre squadrons designated 'A' through 'C', the regiment drew personnel from New South Wales for its headquarters squadron, while its sabre squadrons came from Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. In May, the regiment provided two squadrons ‚Äì 'A' and 'B' ‚Äì for the newly formed 8th Divisional Cavalry Regiment, and as a result raised new squadrons from personnel recruited in New South Wales and Queensland. Part of the Second Australian Imperial Force that was raised for overseas service, originally the regiment was conceived as an armoured reconnaissance regiment attached to the 7th Division and, after undertaking initial training around Cowra, New South Wales, it was sent to the Middle East theatre in December 1940. After arriving in Egypt in early 1941, the regiment conducted further training was used mainly in a defensive role. Equipped with Vickers light tanks and Bren carriers, it carried out garrison duties around the Suez Canal, before being moved to Cyprus following the fall of Greece. In August 1941, the regiment was moved to Syria where it formed part of the Allied occupation forces. In March 1942, the regiment returned to Australia, following the entry of Japan into the war. After a period of training and defensive duties in Queensland, in September 1942 the regiment was sent to New Guinea to help defend Port Moresby as the Japanese continued their advance along the Kokoda Track. Upon the 2/7th's arrival, the decision was made for the regiment to leave its Bren carriers in Port Moresby and as the campaign began to turn in the favour of the Australians the 2/7th were flown to Popondetta to reinforce the units there in December. For over a month they took part in the fighting around Huggins Roadblock along the Sananada Track serving in the dismounted role as infantry. Finally on 21 January 1943 the Australians linked up with US forces and the Sanananda village fell. Shortly afterwards the regiment was withdrawn back to Dobodura airstrip from where they were transported back to Australia. The casualties that the regiment had suffered during the fighting were very high with 54 men killed and 67 wounded. On top of this over 200 men had contracted malaria and three had died from scrub typhus. Among those that were killed was the regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Edgar Logan. During its time in the Middle East and in New Guinea, the regiment lost 59 men killed or died on active service and 67 wounded. Four members of the regiment were decorated with the Military Medal. alt=Men wearing military uniforms including jungle greens and slouch hats, display Japanese flags Following its return to Australia, the regiment began reorganising on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. At this time the Australian Army was undergoing a period of restructuring as its strategic focus shifted towards concentrating upon fighting the war against the Japanese in the Pacific. As a part of this restructuring it was decided that there was no need for divisional cavalry regiments, however, it was decided that the independent companies should be grouped together under a regimental structure, and in response the divisional cavalry regiments were broken up and their headquarters elements were used to administer the commando squadrons. Three such units were formed at this time, with the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment adopting the title of the 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment in April 1943. The regiment's subordinate squadrons were: the 2/3rd, 2/5th and 2/6th Commando Squadrons, however, in terms of tactics and training the individual squadrons retained their independence. Although the 2/6th Commando Squadron was deployed to New Guinea in late 1943 and into early 1944, the regiment as a whole did not see action again until late in the war when they landed along with the rest of the 7th Division Balikpapan, Borneo, in July 1945 in one of the final campaigns of the war. Landing on Green Beach on 1 July 1945, the regiment's three squadrons participated in the advance along the Vasey Highway, undertaking the flank protection and reconnaissance roles before contributing to the mopping up effort as the war came to a close. Following the end of hostilities, the regiment was disbanded.

This episode first aired in the United States on March 1, 2009. Plot Brett and Jemaine find a flurry of activity at the New York New Zealand Consulate over the impending arrival of the Prime Minister of New Zealand. Murray also announces that he has arranged a gig for Bret and Jemaine as Simon and Garfunkel impersonators. The pair object to playing other people's music, which Murray comments is better than theirs; they sell out for $50 each. At the nightclub, they perform an out-of-sync \\"Scarborough Fair\\", socialise with various musical impersonators, and Jemaine is picked up by an Art Garfunkel fanatic (Mary Lynn Rajskub). The following day the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Brian, arrives and Murray has Jemaine and Bret give him a cultural tour of New York City. The subsequent tour of New York only shows them at the Pawn Shop discussing what reality is as per the movie The Matrix, the movie having only just come out in New Zealand (a decade after its USA release). Both Dave and Brian believe the Matrix exists and that d√©j√† vu is evidence of a glitch in it. Jemaine goes on his dinner date with the Art Garfunkel fan, despite Mel's warnings that the other woman is deranged. The fan demands that he dress up at Art Garfunkel again for sex. The scene cuts out to the song \\"Demon Woman\\" in the music video style of Judas Priest. Murray, Bret and Brian take the White House Tour in Washington, D.C., but are denied entry to see the president. The second song entitled \\"Oh, Dance, Baby\\" is performed by Bret in a Korean karaoke style. Brian chews out Murray for his failure to set up a presidential meeting, but accepts Murray's formal apology. This leads to a party-planning discussion with the original Prime Ministerial BBQ becoming a rooftop fondue party. Murray hires a Barack Obama impersonator (Louis Ortiz) to attend, which is a success in fooling the Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister spots two Elton John impersonators sneaking off together, believes this to be a glitch in the Matrix and runs to jump off the roof of the building. Meanwhile, at his new girlfriend's house, Jemaine is shocked when the real Art Garfunkel turn ups and asks her to take him back, which she does. Whilst walking along the street Jemaine notices Mel and Doug, who is dressed in a Bret costume, making out in a parked car. He returns home to find Bret performing Paul Simon's 1980s solo work accompanied by several men wearing traditional African garb (√† la Ladysmith Black Mambazo).

She was a first cousin of Louis XIV as well of her husband. She was the shortest-serving Savoyard consort, dying at the age of fifteen, childless. Biography Arms of Fran√ßoise Madeleine d'Orl√©ans while Duchess of Savoy Orl√©ans was born at the Ch√¢teau de Saint Germain en Laye outside Paris in 1648. She was the youngest surviving daughter of Gaston d'Orl√©ans and his second wife Marguerite of Lorraine. From birth, she was styled Mademoiselle de Valois, derived from one of her father's subsidiary titles. She was the favourite sister of La Grande Mademoiselle, the famous heiress. She grew up in the company of her sisters and Mademoiselle de La Valli√®re, future mistress of Louis XIV. She resided at the Ch√¢teau de Blois. Her father died in 1660 and her mother remained unmarried. As French court etiquette dictated, she held the status of a Granddaughter of France as a male line descendant of the late king Henry IV of France. She was styled as a petite- fille de France. Under the influence of her paternal aunt Christine Marie, Dowager Duchess of Savoy, she was engaged to her first cousin Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy. Christine Marie had chosen her as she had wanted to maintain her power and influence in government having previously been regent for her son since 1637. The match was approved of by Cardinal Mazarin who had previously rejected Marie Jeanne of Savoy, another candidate for Charles Emmanuel II. Orl√©ans proved suitably docile and was chosen over Marie Jeanne. Orl√©ans married the Duke of Savoy by proxy at the Palais du Louvre on 4 March 1663. The couple met for the first time at Annecy on 3 April 1663 where they were married officially. The couple travelled to Turin, capital of Savoy, where they arrived on 15 June 1663. She was known as Francesca Maddalena d'Orl√©ans in her adopted Savoy. The duchess soon died on 14 Jan 1664 at the Royal Palace of Turin, leaving her husband without an heir. She was buried at Turin Cathedral where she rests today. Her husband, inconsolable at her death, ordered a lavish funeral. After Orl√©ans' death, Louis XIV tried to engage La Grande Mademoiselle to Charles Emmanuel II who refused the match. He later married again to Marie Jeanne of Savoy by whom he had a son.

He served as a Union Army officer during the American Civil War, in which he was noted for his many improvements and innovations concerning the artillery used by the Union forces. He is especially remembered for developing the Rodman gun, which in various sizes saw extensive use in coastal defenses, and was called the \\"strongest cast iron cannon ever made.\\" General Rodman also discovered the use of shaped gunpowder grains, in which properly compressing and shaping the gunpowder into pre-designed grain shapes allowed the control of gas production by the burning gunpowder. This resulted in increased muzzle velocities with lower maximum pressures when compared to performance with conventional ball powder. The Rodman seven perforation grain was named after Rodman, and similar propellant grain shapes are still in use today in artillery, rockets, and automotive airbag inflators. After the conflict Rodman remained with the U.S. Army in his chosen profession, and is also noted for his alleged controversies while in command of the Watertown Arsenal. Early life and career Thomas Jackson Rodman was born in 1816 on a farm near Salem in Washington County, Indiana. He was a son of James Rodman and his wife Elizabeth Burton, who was originally from Virginia. In 1837 Rodman entered the United States Military Academy in West Point, and graduated four years later, standing seventh out of 52 cadets. On July 1, 1841, he was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Ordnance Department.Eicher, p. 460. On December 13, 1843, Rodman married Martha Ann Black (1823‚Äì1908), and the couple would have seven children together. His two daughters were named Florence (born 1849) and Ella Elizabeth (born 1856), and his sons were named: John B. (1844‚Äì1909), Edmund B. (born 1846), Thomas Jackson Jr. (1852‚Äì1919), Robert S. (born 1855), and Addison B. (born 1858.) Two of Rodman's sons also attended West Point. Addison Burton Rodman was admitted on July 1, 1877, but resigned on December 18 that same year. John Black Rodman was admitted on September 1, 1863, graduated on June 15, 1868, served initially with the 20th U.S. Infantry, and rose to the rank of colonel before retiring. Rodman also saw limited military action in 1846‚Äì48 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The Rodman gun and Civil War service Starting in 1844, Rodman began running experiments to overcome the size limitations of cast iron cannon due to the way they were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were cast solid and then cooled only on their outside, resulting in uneven cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface. This process also \\"created internal strains and structural irregularities,\\" and these problems were even more prevalent in large bore castings, especially on any actual openings in the cannon that were designed. Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the cooling process, break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a hollow core and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: \\"Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the 'wet chill process', forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior.\\" Doing this forced the thickest material toward the center of the barrel, and Rodman would then patent this invention. A comparison of the Rodman 7-perf grain with an equal amount of ball powder shows even burn which results in better performance with less stress on the gun. An example of a 15-inch Rodman gun during the American Civil War. This one was part of Battery Rodgers protecting Washington, D.C. On March 3, 1847, Rodman was promoted to first lieutenant, and was promoted to the rank of captain on July 1, 1855. Rodman experimented for almost a decade at the Fort Pitt Foundry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, testing his theory and performing trial runs of his cannon barrels. After viewing the results, the U.S. War Department approved construction of a fifteen-inch smoothbore columbiad of Rodman's design in 1859. On December 23 a prototype was cast, and it test fired 509 times without incident. The following year he supervised its construction at the foundry, and once complete it was shipped for testing to Fortress Monroe at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. It tested successfully there in March 1861, but due to its size and weight it would be destined for permanent, fixed positions, and not suitable for field service nor naval use. The specifications of this gun were: overall length of fifteen feet, ten inches long; and a bore length of thirteen feet, nine inches; total weight around 50,000 pounds. This design, capable of firing either shell or shot, would be the base for most of the Rodman guns that followed. Rodman also addressed the effectiveness of the gunpowder used in cannons. During 1856 his experiments showed that using powder compressed into hexagonal-shaped grains with several holes cut lengthwise into them caused the grains to burn outside as well as in, unlike their predecessors. This resulted in a longer and more consistent burn time in the bore, increasing the muzzle velocity of the round fired, thereby increasing the range of the weapon. As a result of his work, on April 17, 1861, Rodman reported to the U.S. War Department that he could now produce reliable cannon in almost any size using the methods he had developed.Civil War Artillery site description of Rodman's artillery experiments; National Park Service article. In November 1861 the first U.S. Government order was made for Rodman's fifteen-inch cannon, \\"...the largest in the U.S. arsenal.\\" During the conflict around 130 fifteen-inch, 445 ten-inch, and 213 eight-inch Rodman guns were purchased by the U.S. Government, and an unknown number made after the conflict. The distinctive rear knob of a 15-inch Rodman gun Another innovation Rodman developed was a replacement for the rear knob of cannons (a part of the area called a cascabel) which is used for fitting the gear that lifted and lowered the gun. Older designs had a knob that was small and round, which were found to easily break on the larger barrels being cast at the Fort Pitt Foundry. Rodman gave his cannon a short knob nearly as wide as the base of the barrel, a distinctive and easily recognizable feature of Rodman's guns. He also created instruments capable of measuring the internal pressure of his cannons. Rodman's contributions and the extent his work was utilized had been described as: Throughout the American Civil War, Rodman was commander and superintendent of the Watertown Arsenal, located along the Charles River in Watertown, Massachusetts. He also served on the army's Fortification Board during the war, and on June 1, 1863, Rodman was promoted to the rank of major. He would spend about three years designing a twenty-inch cannon (the largest he would create) and the work finally began on February 11, 1864. Using several of the arsenal's furnaces, about 160,000 pounds of molten iron were cast into four separate molds, then a week of cooling followed, and the cannon was finished on a huge lathe specially built for this task. A railroad flatcar capable of holding the gun, and its large carriage weighing 36,000 pounds itself, were also made under Rodman's supervision at the arsenal. While awaiting shipment to Fort Hamilton in New York Harbor, the large cannon drew spectators. On July 23, 1864, the Pittsburgh Gazette newspaper reported \\"Juveniles, aged from ten to fifteen years, were amusing themselves today in crawling into the bore on their hands and knees. A good sized family including ma and pa, could find shelter in the gun and it would be a capital place to hide in case of a bombardment....\\" As the American Civil War ended in 1865, Rodman was rewarded for his service with three brevet promotions in the U.S. Army, all occurring on March 13, making him a brevet brigadier general.Find A Grave entry for Rodman; ...for \\"faithful, meritorious and distinguished services in the Ordnance Department\\"Eicher, p. 460. Advanced to the ranks of Brevet Lt. Col. USA, Brevet Col. USA, and Brevet Brig. Gen. USA, on March 13, 1865. Later career, controversy, and death Watertown Arsenal's Building #71, circa 1969 After the war ended, Rodman chose to remain in the U.S. Army. His actions while in command of the Watertown Arsenal drew the attention of the powerful Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War, who investigated allegations of Rodman's possible disloyalty, improper management of the facility, and misuse of government resources, among other items. In particular he was charged with the following: Almost 100 witnesses were called to testify before the Committee on this matter, however Rodman was not permitted to cross-examine any of them; instead he was only allowed to refute these charges in a letter to his own commander, Brig. Gen. Alexander B. Dyer, the army's Chief of Ordnance. To the accusations concerning his personal loyalty, Rodman answered \\"that he had given much attention to the loyalty of his men, and he showed his vigilance in pointing out that there had been no accidents at the Arsenal during his tenure there.\\" To the charge he failed to properly celebrate the Union victory and mourn Lincoln, he stated \\"that he had not fired a salute in recognition of the end of the war and of the President's death because he had never received official orders to do so.\\" The issue investigated most heavily by the Committee, however, concerned the building of the post commander's residence at the Watertown Arsenal. Speculation and rumor as to its total cost ranged up to $100,000 to $150,000 USD, and that such extravagance was only to benefit Rodman himself. To the second claim Rodman stated that he had received orders to construct the residence (along with specifications and plans for it) by his superiors in the Ordnance Department, but the first claim required further testimony. Rodman stated that \\"every economy possible was being observed in constructing the house\\" and other witnesses testified that the cost (estimated to be between $40,000 and $60,000) was reasonable for its completion; the final total would come to $63,478.65. Rock Island Arsenal's Building #1, circa 1985 The investigation itself developed its own controversy. Believing the Committee was hearing only \\"one-sided testimony\\" the civilians of Watertown wrote affidavits praising Rodman's performance, asking he remain commander of the arsenal, and demanding he receive a fair trial. The hearings were described as \\"More than 90 witnesses were examined by Honorable Mr. Gooch of the Congressional Committee, who appears to have carefully selected for testimony those persons who advocated Rodman's removal; and to have asked leading questions to any witnesses who may have been in sympathy with the commanding officer.\\" Although the investigation was completed, the results of the charges against him were never revealed, and in July 1865 Rodman was sent to Rock Island, Illinois, to supervise the construction of a new arsenal. This facility would become the Rock Island Arsenal, where Rodman would spend the rest of his life and career, as well as building an even larger commander's residence. On March 7, 1867, Rodman was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. He died on duty at Rock Island on June 7, 1871, and was buried on June 17 in the arsenal's National Cemetery. Reflecting a pattern of naming many Washington, DC streets in newly developed areas in the Capital after Civil War generals, an east-west street in the Northwest quadrant is named Rodman Street, NW.

He was regarded as one of the top confidence and bunco men in the United States during the late 19th century whose success was matched only by contemporaries such as Tom O'Brien and Charles P. Miller, sharing the title of \\"King of the Bunco Men\\" with both men at various times in his career.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 179-181) Hyde, Stephen and Geno Zanetti, ed. Players: Con Men, Hustlers, Gamblers and Scam Artists. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 2002. (pg. 128) Over a period of 30 years, Lewis amassed a huge personal fortune almost solely through targeting wealthy bankers, merchants and other prominent figures. This was most often because more of a profit could be made while they were less likely to report the crime to police. Among his more well-known victims included General John A. Logan, Judge Noah Davis, Charles Francis Adams, and most notably Irish author Oscar Wilde. An 1885 biography of Lewis attributes to him the phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\" BiographyEarly criminal career= Originally from Chicago, Illinois, Lewis had several runs-in with the law during the 1880s and early 1890s. In 1880, Lewis was arrested for the shooting of Boston thief Billy Flynn in Detroit but was acquitted by a jury who ruled he had acted in self-defense. He later made the acquaintance of Gen. John A. Logan, and one night while dining with him at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, a hotel detective informed Logan of Lewis's identity. Logan scoffed at the detective's claim and remarked \\"Why sir, that man is one of my best friends. You have made a terrible mistake here\\". Lewis excused himself after borrowing $500 from him and disappeared. He similarly befriended Charles Francis Adams and lured the elderly man into a Boston Common bunco game where he and his friends swindled him out of several thousand dollars. Later in Philadelphia, he represented himself to Samuel J. Randall as the son of banker A.J. Drexel. He was apparently so convincing that, when the actual son of Drexel called on the house by chance, Ramsden believed the young man was the impostor and threw him out of his home. He and another noted bunco man called Western Sam spent an entire summer in Long Branch, New Jersey where they conned over $100,000 from residents.\\"Hungry Joe\\" To Be Released.; Alvany, the Bunko Man, Will Soon Complete His Prison Term\\". _New York Times._ 3 May 1896 The most famous of victims was perhaps Irish author Oscar Wilde whom he met in New York City while visiting the U.S. on a lecture tour in 1882. Lewis dined with Wilde at the Hotel Brunswick for several days before managing to persuade Wilde in joining a bunco game. Wilde lost $5,000 and gave Lewis a check for the Park National Bank, but afterwards stopped payment when he learned he had been swindled. Lewis later claimed that he had taken $1,500 in cash from Wilde before he was discovered. Inspector Thomas F. Byrnes, then head of the NYPD Detective's Bureau, later commented that when Wilde had \\"reaped a harvest of American dollars with his curls, sun flowers and knee-britches\\" he was no less a swindler than Lewis \\"only not quite so sharp\\".Klein, Marcus. Easterns, Westerns, and Private Eyes: American Matters, 1870-1900. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1994. (pg. 170) =Years in New York City= Lewis became so infamous in New York City, his base of operations for many years, that he was once thrown out of the Twenty-Ninth Precinct by Captain Alexander \\"Clubber\\" Williams having recognized him as the man who attempted to con his brother while on the Pavona Ferry in 1884.\\"King Of The Bunko Men.; Hungry Joe Becomes A Vulgar Robber. Stealing 50 From A Wealthy English Manufacturer-- Likely To Make A Visit To Sing Sing\\". _New York Times._ 22 May 1885 Lewis was arrested with a young prot√©g√© named Oliver Wilson while attempting to draw in victims for a local bunco game in Broadway on April 21, 1885. Police had received reports that there had been bunco men operating in the district as county merchants arriving in the city to make their annual spring purchases. When police officers arrived at the scene, they \\"saw them accost a number of persons, shake hands with them, and act in the manner of \\"bunco steerers\\". They were tried at the Jefferson Market Police Court the following day on a charge of disorderly conduct. Lewis explained away the charges by pointing out that he did not collect a crowd, obstruct the sidewalk, use profane or improper language, or any other cause which legally defined \\"disorderly conduct\\". He also denied having \\"accosted strangers\\" stating to the judge \\"I am not in the habit of accosting strangers. I spoke to and shook hands with several friends. That is the way, I believe, that gentlemen greet one another in the street. I did nothing to justify this arrest\\". One of these men, Lewis claimed, had asked him directions to the Astor Library at which time he was arrested. Despite his defense, Wilson and he were both fined $10. Though both men were well-dressed and \\"wore what appeared to be gold-mounted chains\\", neither had watches or any collateral to pay for their release.\\"\\"Hungry Joe\\" Locked Up; Arrested While Breaking In A Young Recruit\\". _New York Times._ 23 Apr 1885 A month later, Lewis attempted to swindle vacationing wealthy British manufacturer Joseph Ramsden who was in New York for health reasons. Shortly after his arrival from Manchester, England, on which he had traveled on the Cunard steamer Gallia, he booked into a Broadway hotel. Lewis approached Ramsden the next day while taking a walk down Broadway. He greeted Ramsden near the Metropolitan Hotel calling the surprised tourist by name and inquiring about his health. When Ransden expressed his astonishment at having been recognized by, in his view a total stranger, Lewis introduced himself as the nephew of the captain of the Gallia and who had \\"spoke very kindly of him\\". Claiming to be a manufacturer of women's undergarments in Baltimore, he then used the introduction to lure him to a bunco game. Lewis explained that he was preparing to leave for Baltimore but offered Ramsden to join him as he went to purchase tickets at a nearby railroad station. Ramsden agreed and the two walked together down Broadway while Lewis gave him a guided tour and pointing out businesses and giving exaggerated accounts of business dealing with various New York business firms. They eventually arrived at a building on Canal Street and proceeded to an office of the second floor where Lewis \\"bought\\" a ticket from a young man. While there, Lewis showed Ramsden his valise and showed him the various tools of his trade, mainly muslin and paint goods, before discovering a pack of cards at the bottom of the bag. He then demonstrated a card trick which he claimed had cost him $400 in a Bowery saloon the day before. Showing him how to play three-card monte, the man who had sold Lewis the ticket encouraged Ramsden to play a hand. When Ramsden refused to bet however, the man attempted to provoke him claiming he had no money to bet with. He then asked Lewis to leave, and turning to the young man, he showed him a roll of bank notes from the Bank of England worth ¬£50. At this point, Lewis grabbed the roll and ran out of the building. When the astonished Ramsden had recovered, he went outside to find Lewis but he had escaped. Similarly, he returned to the office to find the room had been emptied. On the advice of friends, Ramsden reported the incident to NYPD Police Headquarters whereupon Lewis immediately was identified as the suspect. This was the first charge of robbery brought against Lewis, and the case against him was so great that Inspector Byrnes ordered an extensive citywide \\"arrest-on-sight\\" search. Lewis managed to avoid capture for a time, and the police were unable to find him at his usual hangouts. However, he eventually was spotted on Broadway by Inspector Byrnes and Detective Richard O'Connor who followed him to a house on Sixth Avenue where he was arrested. He later was identified by Ramsden in a police lineup with seven other men. He continually denied the charge claiming his name as Henry F. Post. Although he had been arrested numerous times, this was the first time Lewis convicted. He served four years in Sing Sing. In May 1888, Lewis was released after serving three years. Lewis was identified eight months later in the NYPD's \\"Rogue's Gallery\\" by William J. Bansemer, a wealthy and retired Baltimore merchant, who lost $5,000 to him in a bunco game. He was arrested in New York on December 1, 1888, and extradited to Baltimore to stand trial.\\"Victim of \\"Hungry Joe\\"\\". _New York Times._ 8 Dec 1888 =Imprisonment in Baltimore= On December 20, 1888, Lewis was convicted of having \\"bunkoed\\" Baltimore businessman William J. Bansemer out of $5,000. He was sentenced to nine years in the Maryland State Penitentiary, but his term was reduced for good behavior, and he was released on June 20, 1896. Upon his release, he spoke against his imprisonment claiming he had been wrongly convicted. He further claimed that he could have been able to provide an alibi if had he been given the opportunity, but that he had been advised by his lawyer to plead guilty in order to avoid a maximum 15-year jail sentence. Lewis blamed the \\"frame up\\" on Inspector Byrnes, whom he claimed had a long-standing grudge against him and had used his influence to manipulate the police investigation and trial. He also made vague accusations regarding Bynes involvement in police misconduct and corruption, but nothing came of the charges. On the morning of his release, he was given $167 by Warden Weyler, which he had earned during his last 18 months in prison. Lewis's health and appearance had reportedly been significantly affected during imprisonment, the New York Times noting \\"his powerful frame does not indicate the sprightliness and vigor of seven years ago. His keen eyes have dimmed, and his hair is sprinkled with silver\\". He moved to New York City where he claimed he intended to lead an honest life as a bookmaker and \\"follow the horse races\\".\\"Hungry Joe\\" Out Of Prison.; He Starts for New-York Intending to Become a Bookmaker\\". _New York Times._ 21 Jun 1896 =Death= Lewis visited NYPD Police Headquarters upon his arrival in New York two days later and informed Captain Stephen O'Brien, who had succeeded Byrnes as chief of detectives of his intentions.\\"\\"Hungry Joe\\" Comes To Town\\". _New York Times._ 23 Jun 1896 He apparently remained true to his word, and as of early 1902, he was observed by Captain George McClusky working as a cigar vendor in the Bowery. On March 22, 1902, Lewis's death was reported by NYPD police officials and announced in the New York Times and the New York Sun the following day.\\"\\"Hungry Joe\\" Reported Dead\\". _New York Times._ 23 Mar 1902 The report could not be verified however, his death having once been falsely reported in Baltimore, and his name was not listed in the New York City Board of Health. His friends responded that he had died in an apartment house on Manhattan's West Side and that his funeral had been held three days after his death. The name on the coffin, they claimed, was unrelated to Lewis so he could be buried anonymously.\\"Hungry Joe\\" Reported Dead.; But The Famous Bunco Man Has Been Dead Before. Died Here This Time; Last Time It Was in Baltimore - Among the Swindler's Dupes Were Gen. Logan, Oscar Wilde, Judge Noah Davis and C.F. Adams\\". _New York Sun._ 23 Mar 1902 He was known to a whole generation as the king of the confidence men. Owen Davis mentions him in his 1906 collection of New York Tenderloin stories Sketches of Gotham (written under the name of ‚ÄòIke Swift‚Äô). In the story \\"The End of the Road\\", Swift spoke of the ease with which a deception had been practiced by one lady of doubtful reputation upon another. Swift stated, simply, \\"The blonde fell like a farmer before Hungry Joe\\". ReferencesFurther reading *Asbury, Herbert.

Tracing back to one founding stallion, this breed of horse was bred to meet demands of daily ranch work, while still being gentle. Blazers are known for being versatile at any sport competition and having gentle and intelligent dispositions. Breed History The Blazer horse traces back to the chestnut stallion Little Blaze, who was foaled in 1959. Little Blaze was bred and owned by F. Neil Hinck, an American horse trainer from Bedford, Wyoming. The descendant of Mormon pioneers and Danish horsemen, Hinck came from a ranch family and had extensive experience with most breeds of the day.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=hinck&GSmid;=46588789&GRid;=36361619& He produced the Blazer by combining the American Quarter Horse and the Morgan Horse with blood of the Shetland Pony, and Thoroughbred. The Blazer Horse Association was incorporated in 1967 at Star, Idaho. In 2006 it was renamed the American Blazer Horse Association and became a nonprofit, dedicated to the preserving the breed and maintaining its history. The headquarters was moved to Nampa, Idaho the same year. Registered Blazer horses in stud book must pass a veterinary inspection and have at least one parent with documented lineage to the stallion Little Blaze. Breed Characteristics Blazer horses do not exceed at full maturity, although they can be registered as small as . Their colors include black, bay and chestnut, as well as buckskin, palomino and many shades of dun. They have a refined head, bold eyes, extreme sloping of the shoulders, short backs, round croups, long hips, and have thick bone for strength and durability. They must also have a good disposition.

The extension to Toledo gave travelers in Michigan the opportunity to connect with eastbound trains such as the Lake Shore Limited without backtracking to Chicago. Amtrak re-routed the train from Toledo to Pontiac, Michigan in 1995.  History  The Lake Cities made its first run on August 3, 1980, using the same Turboliner equipment as its predecessor.

It began as an outreach clinic under a tree, and has grown into a 112-bed hospital providing health care and health education services to a population of over 100,000 people in Uganda. The Hospital began with a special mission to help the Batwa pygmies who were displaced from the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest after it was made a National Park in 1991. Since leaving the forest many Batwa have lived in extreme poverty and are affected by the health issues that poverty brings. While the hospital was started particularly to provide health care to the Twa, it quickly found itself treating all people living in the area. The hospital serves the population in 3 sub-counties of Kayonza, Mpungu and Kanyantorogo in Kanungu District. There are few other decent health services in this extremely remote area and people sometimes walk for more than a day to get to the Hospital. Its status was upgraded from health centre to hospital in 2008 after a new operating theater was built.  The Kellermanns  Batwa pygmies inhabited the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest for thousands of years, but became conservation refugees largely as a result of efforts to protect endangered mountain gorillas. Some people had to walk 20 kilometres to get to the nearest health centre to receive treatment for their health problems. When Scott and Carol Kellermann began their work in Bwindi in 2001, they came as missionaries to help the Batwa pygmies. Out of the population of 100,000 people in the Bwindi area, around 800 are Batwa. Hospital Statistics Monthly averages for the first half of 2012/13 compared with the last half of 2011/12 are as below * Out Patient Department attendance 2,509 (9% growth) * Deliveries 104 (10% growth) * Surgery (major operations) 45 (13% growth) * Admissions on adult and children's ward 389 (56% increase) * HIV testing 845 (5% decrease) * eQuality subscription 28,000(17%growth) * 100% of the babies‚Äô borne of HIV positive mothers that enrolled in the hospital's prevention from mother to Child Treatment (PMTCT) before delivery were discharged HIV free. * 97% of patients with TB completed their treatment successfully. Staff Demographics Bwindi Community Hospital is a Church of Uganda (Anglican) Hospital under the Diocese of Kinkiizi. It is staffed by a team of 125. These include: doctors, nurses, midwives, other health workers and support staff. 70% of the employees are from within the hospital's catchment area and 30% are from other parts of Uganda. The lab technicians test for everything, including HIV and Tuberculous. The Community Bwindi Community Hospital cares for more than 100,000 people living in the South Western corner of Uganda. The Hospital is located twelve hours drive, on poor roads, from Kampala, the capital, two kilometres from the Eastern border of the Congo, and one kilometre from Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Most of the people here are farmers or herders who live without running water and electricity, many walk for hours daily to collect water and firewood, and most families survive on less than $1 a day. Malaria has always been the biggest killer in the Bwindi area, and is easily preventable simply by sleeping under a mosquito net. Many people still suffer from diarrhea because they don't know enough about how to access clean water, and families go hungry because they don't have the knowledge and skills to be able to grow and prepare a balanced diet. Many children with malnutrition and adults with tuberculosis go undiagnosed in the community because of a lack of screening. = The Twa = The life expectancy is 28 for the Twa versus 53 for the average Ugandan. The Batwa are poorer, and have more limited access to health care. In the past Batwa women would be beaten while in labour by health workers to stop them from crying, or even denied health care altogether when they tried to take their sick children to health facilities. Only one out of every fourteen Batwa women is on family planning compared with one out of four of their Bakiga neighbours. Batwa children are more likely to die, more likely to be malnourished, are less likely to go to school, and are less likely to sleep under a mosquito net than the rest of society. Byumba Health Centre II opened in June 2009 on the edge of a Batwa settlement. It employs three Batwa and three Bakiga workers. The nursing team looks after more than 500 patients a month. The Byumba team teaches in local schools and villages, and makes a special effort to reach out to the Batwa pygmies with family planning, HIV testing, pregnancy care, immunization, and education about clean water and prevention of malaria. Village Health promoters from Bwindi travel to other Batwa settlements in the area every Friday for teaching, the sale of mosquito nets, and treatment of common health problems. The Hospital is located within walking distance of two other Batwa communities. Batwa have always received free health care at the Hospital, and the Hospital is working together with partners, including the Batwa Development Program, in the area to encourage the Batwa to generate income that enables them to make a contribution to the cost of their care. Pediatric Care The child mortality rate of Twa is 38% for children under five compared with 18% in the general Ugandan population. The only Neo-natal unit in the district helps infants survive. With this in mind the hospital has developed a specialist unit for sick newborn babies and children. The neonatal unit is the only unit for a population of 300,000 people in the whole district of Kanungu. 91.1% of newborn babies admitted to the neonatal unit survive. Each month more than 500 children visit the Outpatient department and more than 100 are admitted to the ward. The leading health problems are respiratory infections, malaria, diarrheal diseases and malnutrition. On average 15 children are admitted every month with malnutrition. It costs a minimum of 540,000 UGX ($245) to give a full package of health care to every malnourished child on the ward. Outside the ward is a children's play area, a kitchen and a demonstration garden where mothers (and occasionally fathers) can learn skills about how to grow and cook a balanced diet for their children. The ward staff organizes practical cooking sessions with the mothers of the admitted children every week. These are always preceded by singing and dancing. Children who were previously admitted with severe malnutrition are followed-up with to see if their nutritional status is improving. Specialist clinics are held each week for children with long-term diseases. Collaborations with health organizations like Organization Useful Rehabilitation Service (OURS) and Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services in Uganda (CoRSU) offer additional services for children such as physical rehabilitation and repair of congenital defects. Bwindi's child health services get support from Sustain for Life, a charity in the UK and TOUCH Uganda in the United States but there is a lot more to be done. Adding the money spent on staff, drugs, electricity and other supplies it costs about $30 a day to keep a child in Hospital. The average family in Bwindi lives on about $1 a day and has seven children. They do contribute a small amount, but the local community cannot afford the full costs of care. The average child with malnutrition stays for more than two weeks, and the total cost of providing all of the child health services is $130,000 a year. Outreach Programs Bwindi Community Hospital is much more than just a Hospital where sick people stay to receive treatment. The Community Health and Batwa team together with the Village health teams make up a large part of the services provided by the Hospital. They: * Teach in every school in the area at least once a term, and screen every child for dental problems. * Take education and treatment to remote Batwa pygmy settlements each week. * Immunize children in villages where there are no other services available. * Bring health discussions directly into every household through weekly radio shows. * Have trained volunteer health workers, called Village Health Promoters (VHP) in every village. * Take HIV testing and treatment to places not previously receiving services. * Enable women to get birth control without having to come to Hospital. Every two years a Household Survey of all homes in the Bwindi area is conducted to measure the progress of the Community Health interventions led by the Hospital. To see the latest survey click here Malaria still kills and it is important to spread the word about the use of mosquito nets. = HIV = Bwindi Community Hospital sends its HIV team into the surrounding area three days each week for a mobile testing and treatment clinic. The HIV team takes a portable CD4 machine with them on outreach clinics, which counts the cells that the HIV virus attacks. With this machine the team has results within eight minutes of taking a blood sample. More than two hundred local people living with HIV have joined one of the hospital's patient support groups, which meet in different parts of the Bwindi area each month. A drama group has been started which tours schools and churches, delivering a delightfully funny and poignant play about a man whose life is changed when he finds out he is HIV positive and accesses treatment. Some members of the patient support group have also started teaching in schools. They have been trained by Bwindi Community Hospital in basic teaching methods, and run lessons about HIV prevention and stigma-reduction in every classroom in the Bwindi area. Other members have been lucky enough to receive young female goats that they take home and rear, returning the first female offspring to the group so that another person can benefit. More than 1,000 people test for HIV each month. Every two years the hospital conducts a community survey that provides information about which parts of the Bwindi area have the largest number of untested people. Counselors and laboratory staff visit these places in order to give all people an opportunity to know their HIV status. = Family Planning = Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world at seven children per woman, and has the youngest population on the planet with a median age of less than fifteen. Large families trap people in poverty with not enough money for food, schooling and health care for their children. High fertility rates are dangerous for women, and make it hard for them to escape traditional childbearing roles. A 3% annual population growth rate is unsustainable for the environment, and leaves younger generations without enough water or land for cultivation. Parent's get education in nutrition, family planning, and general care. Three years ago very few couples in the Bwindi area were accessing family planning (birth control). Now the contraceptive prevalence rate (proportion of women of child-bearing age using some form of contraception) is 28%. The target is 40%. Bwindi Community Hospital, in partnership with Family Health International, has trained 40 village health workers to be able to give contraceptive pills and injections. Now more than 500 women a month access their contraception through this network. The Hospital integrates family planning into HIV and postnatal clinics, and runs Family Planning Camps where hospital staff inserts an implant that lasts for five years. Discussions on family planning is on the local radio, in villages, and in trading centres, particularly with the men of the area who are the real decision makers and often those who are most opposed to reducing family sizes. This is the lobby in the administration building. It is the only 2 story building in the community. None of the patients are charged, so Bwindi Community Hospital relies entirely on donations. The hospital is supplied with drugs from the Government of Uganda but the salaries of the staff, transport costs, and all of the training and support given to the village health workers relies on donations. The Hospital has written a four-year strategic plan describing how to reach the target of 40% contraceptive prevalence, a goal that will require about $20,000 per year. = Waiting mothers' hostel = In Uganda, many rural women give birth at home with the help of traditional birth attendants, barriers to maternal services at hospitals or clinics are due to education, wealth, distance, lack of cultural safety and transportation. The Waiting Mother's Hostel was established so that expectant mothers could come to the hospital early to wait for their due dates. Given the remote location and little reliable means of transport, it is usually hard for a mother to come when she is in labour. The hostel was donated by the Australian embassy. While mothers at the hostel are waiting for their delivery, health education programming is provided daily. = Village Health Teams = Poor roads and lack of public transportation means that many people cannot reach the hospital. Village Health Promoter's (VHP) work together with Bwindi Community Hospital to reach the people who cannot come to the hospital. This is a pioneering project where knowledge and skills about health are shared with every village and household in the Bwindi area. One of two hundred VHP's trained by Bwindi Community Hospital, are easily recognizable by their green T-shirts and the positive attitude towards helping the community. Two or three days each month the VHP's attend workshops led by the Hospital to learn about different aspects of health, and takes the knowledge back to villages. Through the Community Health Team at the Hospital, a strong linkage exists between the hospital and the community. A total of 500 Village Health Teams (VHTS) and Village Health Promoters help to reach 101 villages with health promotion messages. To prevent malnutrition they teach every household how to grow and cook a balanced diet, giving them a list of all the children in their village and teaching them to check them every three months for signs of malnutrition. The VHP refer children and other community members to the Hospital if necessary.  Health Insurance Scheme eQuality is a community Health Membership scheme that was launched in March 2010 as a mechanism to help people of the Bwindi area have access to equitable, quality, and sustainable health care services affordable to all. BCH works in close relationship with the community through Bataka groups to implement eQuality currently in the three sub counties of Kayonza, Mpungu and Kanyantorogo, although due to high demand, a few Bataka groups in Kiruhura and Kanungu town council were included last year. The scheme, which is in its third year of operation, has had its membership grow to 24,323 as of June 1, 2012. This is 40% of the target population of 60,000 people living in the three sub counties of Kayonza, Mpungu, and Kanyantorogo. In the 80's the country was experiencing close to 25% percent prevalence in AIDS infections and by the 90's, due to a lack of Retrovirals, population reduction due to the AIDS epidemic was astounding. People who traveled to Uganda in the 90's remember the ‚Äúboom‚Äù in casket making. At the village level a structure and community process was created to address the large number of deaths. In the southwest region burial leaders were selected and they would coordinate the burial, donations, and assistance to the families. Their motto for this process was Bataka Twizikye, ‚ÄúLet us bury ourselves.‚Äù As the idea for a community health care scheme began to take root the hospital searched for a motto. The very way that health insurance works is that the whole community ‚Äúpools‚Äù their money to care for each other. When they need to go to the hospital they have paid their 6,000 UGX (US$3) per person per year. The pooled money is available to pay for their treatment. The natural motto then became built upon the earlier burial phrase, it became, Bataka Twetambire, ‚ÄúLet us heal ourselves.‚Äù  Future Projects  A satellite clinic in Kanyashogyi has been opened and a satellite clinic in Kanyantorogo is planned for 2013. A nursing school is being built next to the hospital to further facilitate the training of local people in the skills and knowledge of nursing. The hope is to both provide a school and a training place for any interested student. Planned to open mid-2013.

That places his birthdate at or somewhat before 1847. was a French amateur bird trainer who believed that swallows could be put to use for military communications. During the late 19th century Desbouvrie persuaded the government of France to conduct a study on the feasibility of using swallows as messengers. His early demonstrations showed that swallows could exhibit homing behavior and that when they did so they flew much faster than homing pigeons. Desbouvrie also succeeded in curbing the birds' natural migratory behavior. After obtaining authorization from the government for follow-up testing, Desbouvrie delayed and did not follow through with rigorous experimentation. Desbouvrie received international attention in the press for two unrelated reasons: the bird experiments, and also for a proposal he made to the Paris Academy of Medicine. The Academy published his paper, which declared chronic alcoholism to be a serious public health problem and offered a solution in the form of a claimed cure for hangovers. Desbouvrie hypothesized that the consumption of food which contained an appropriate balance of fat and albumen would prevent hangovers from occurring. He sent the Academy a selection of homemade chocolates along with his manuscript, with assurances that he had tested the concoction extensively upon himself.  Youth  Jean Desbouvrie born Jean Baptiste Desbouvrie, was the son of Fr√©d√©ric Joseph Desbouvrie, servant, fruit merchant and Catherine Joseph Derain, housewife[1843-1844&unitid;=&unitdate;=1843-1844 Naissance entre 1843 et 1843 Commune : ROUBAIX] (archivesdepartementales.lenord.fr), and was born in the \\"Hameau du Triez Saint-Joseph\\" in Roubaix[1843-1844&unitid;=&unitdate;=1843-1844 Naissance entre 1843 et 1843 Commune : ROUBAIX] (archivesdepartementales.lenord.fr). He had a brother, Marie Joseph Henri, born in 1847.  Swallow training  The house on the quai de la Vigne where Desbouvrie kept his swallows. Swallows in flight. Jean Desbouvrie then lived in a house on the quai de la Vigne (currently quai de Rouen) at the edge of the Canal de Roubaix near the pont de la Vigne (also known as pont Salembier) in the \\"Hameau de la Grande VigneJournal de Roubaix du 14 Juillet 1890 (bn-r.fr)L‚ÄôAvenir de Roubaix Tourcoing du 10 D√©cembre 1889 (bn-r.fr). Desbouvrie kept his swallows in a cage and trained them to fly in and out of the cage. Another challenge he overcame was the birds' natural migratory behavior. Desbouvrie believed that swallows migrated southward because the supply of insects for them to feed upon dwindled in winter; he refused to make public disclosure of what he fed the birds in wintertime, regarding that as a trade secret. Later attempts to train homing behavior into migratory birds determined that the birds have no instinctive knowledge of where to fly when the season changes, so if the normal migratory pattern is disrupted during the first year of life the individual does not migrate afterward. He spent over 30 years keeping birds and devoted two rooms of his house to swallows. One room housed a cage for the swallows. The other room was a training space with a balcony used for practice releases. He documented the age and health of each bird in a register, and marked each one by tying colored silk to its leg, with red indicating a trained bird and blue indicating a partially trained bird. Trained swallows were allowed to roam outside their cages, while the others remained caged at all times. Untrained birds were sold as pets. Desbouvrie participated in the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in front of the War Palace located in the Esplanade des InvalidesL‚ÄôIndicateur de Roubaix et de Tourcoing du 15 Septembre 1889 (bn-r.fr) : > Four of the little prisoners, the oldest not more than twenty days, were let > loose.

In 1889, during the International Farmyard Animal Contest of Bergues, he received a silver-gilt medal and an honorary diploma for his work on war swallowsJournal de Roubaix du 23/10/1889 (bn-r.fr viz. page 2, column 5).  Potential applications of swallow training  The 1955 book Bird Navigation describes efforts at training homing behavior in species other than pigeons. Bird Navigation mentions Desbouvrie as an early experimenter, and also a passage from Pliny the Elder in which \\"Caecina of Volterra\\" (possibly Caecina Paetus) used painted swallows to report the colors of winning horses in a race. It is uncertain whether Desbouvrie was aware of the Pliny's report. Carrier pigeons had been a significant factor in communications during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. An 1892 report in The American Magazine that discussed Desbouvrie's efforts noted the importance of pigeons to that war: \\"Upon several occasions, indeed, the inhabitants of the beleaguered cities looked upon the successful flights of these birds as their only hope betwixt death and starvation.\\" By the late 19th century Russia was training military falcons, possibly to carry messages or else to hunt the war pigeons. Swallows offered several advantages over pigeons if training could succeed. Swallows fly higher and faster, and are more difficult for marksmen to shoot or for birds of prey to intercept. Swallows are also able to feed during flight.  Government interest  Proposed architectural design for a French military aviary to house swallows as messenger birds, 1889 As a demonstration, Desbouvrie brought an untamed swallow from the Roubaix area to Paris and released it. The bird returned to its home 258 kilometers away in 90 minutes. Desbouvrie promised that trained swallows would provide even better speeds. The governor of Lille oversaw testing near Roubaix and a military engineer named Captain Degouy was ordered to oversee a duplication of the Roubaix experiments. Desbouvrie proposed two swallow aviaries at Montmartre and at Fort Mont-Val√©rien. The Montmartre cote was scheduled to be constructed first, if Captain Degouy confirmed the results and recommended further training. A report from The Globe stated that Desbouvrie believed all his birds were too young for full testing and required additional training. The American Magazine noted that Desbouvrie did not breed his birds and obtained them all as nestlings, although he promised he could breed them easily if he wanted to do so. Over half a century later P.W. Brian stated in Bird Navigation that Desbouvrie \\"appeared to be unwilling to demonstrate them.\\" The Globe published a favorable report of Desbouvrie's efforts, although noting that further testing was needed. The Zoologist republished the Globe report with a note that Zoologist editors \\"have no faith in the idea that the experiment will succeed in his object.\\" The American Magazine dismissed the project with the statement, \\"The idea of engaging swallows in war is a pretty one, as, in future, all European wars will have to be conducted in 'swallow time'‚Äîwhen the warm winds blow from the sunny south.\\"  Academy of Medicine presentation  Cover page to the medical bulletin that first reported Desbouvrie's claimed discovery of a preventive cure for hangovers In 1888 the Bulletin de l'academie de medicine (Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine) published a report that Desbouvrie had sent them a manuscript and requested verification of an invention he claimed to have made. He called it was a matter of public health to counter the effects of chronic alcoholism. According to the report, which was republished in English in summary form in the Medical Record and the Cincinnati Lancet-clinic, Desbouvrie had attempted a preventive cure for hangovers. Desbouvrie asserted that the cure required eating albumen and fat in appropriate proportions one hour before alcohol consumption, and had invented a chocolate which he claimed contained both ingredients in an effective ratio. He provided samples to the Academy and assured its members he had tested the cure upon himself.

Limitations on military expression  While the civilian population of the United States is afforded the right to free expression under the First Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the notion that service members have a reduced level of free speech.Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 758 (1974) While the Court acknowledged that service members do have First Amendment rights, these rights are limited:  After September 11, 2001  With the advent of the Iraq War in 2003, the issue of military expression was again in the public eye as a relatively small amount of service members and veterans began demonstrating. One case revolved around a former Marine (still under contract with the IRR) who was photographed by the Washington Post wearing a partial uniform during an anti-war demonstration in Washington, D.C. The individual faced disciplinary action for his participation in this demonstration, as well as for a politically charged email he sent to a Marine officer.Stephen Koff, \\"Corps accused of 'muzzle' tactics\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, May 31, 2007 However, in this case, the service member avoided the other than honorable discharge being sought by the military due to the First Amendment arguments posed on his behalf. That case, which was argued by attorney Mike Lebowitz in representation of anti-war and political activist Adam Kokesh, is regarded as the first military expression case of its kind to result generally favorably for the service member.

It typically inhabits sandy or muddy habitats in coastal waters shallower than , often burying itself in sediment. Usually measuring across, the common stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc slightly wider than long, and a whip-like tail with upper and lower fin folds. It can be identified by its plain coloration and mostly smooth skin, except for a row of tubercles along the midline of the back in the largest individuals. The predominant prey of the common stingray are bottom-dwelling crustaceans, though it also takes molluscs, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are nourished by yolk and later histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother. Females bear 4‚Äì9 young twice per year in shallow water, after a gestation period of four months. The common stingray can inflict a painful, though rarely life- threatening, wound with its venomous tail spine. During classical antiquity, its sting was ascribed many mythical properties. This species is not sought after by commercial fisheries, but is taken in large numbers as bycatch and utilized for food, fishmeal, and liver oil. Its population is apparently dwindling across its range, though there is not yet sufficient data for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it beyond Data Deficient. Taxonomy and phylogeny The oldest published depiction of a common stingray, from Pierre Belon's 1553 De Aquatilibus Libri Duo. Well- documented since classical antiquity, the common stingray was known as trygon (œÑœÅœÖŒ≥œéŒΩ) to the ancient Greeks and as pastinaca to the ancient Romans. An old common name for this species, used in Great Britain since at least the 18th century, is \\"fire-flare\\" or \\"fiery-flare\\", which may refer to the reddish color of its meat. The first formal scientific description of the common stingray, as Raja pastinaca, was authored by the father of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae. It has since been placed in the genus Dasyatis. There are at least 25 earlier references to this ray in literature, under various non-binomial names such as Raja corpore glabro, aculeo longo anterius serrato in cauda apterygia, Pastinaca marina prima, and Pastinaca marina l√¶vis. Many of these early accounts, including Linnaeus', also incorporated information from other species. Consequently, the designation of a lectotype is warranted in the interests of taxonomic stability, but this has yet to be enacted. The blue stingray (Dasyatis chrysonota) of southern Africa has long been regarded as a variant of the common stingray. However, the common stingray lacks the blue markings of the other species and differs in morphological and meristic characters, which led the latter to be definitively recognized as a separate species by Paul Cowley and Leonard Compagno in 1993. The distinction between this species and the similar Tortonese's stingray (D. tortonesei) of the Mediterranean is poorly understood and may not be valid, requiring further investigation. In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger published a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The common stingray was reported to be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and pelagic stingray (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon. Distribution and habitat Sandy areas are a favored habitat for the common stingray. The common stingray is found throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It also occurs, though in significantly lower numbers, in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from southern Norway and the western Baltic Sea to Madeira and the Canary Islands. This bottom-dwelling species can be found from the shore to a depth of , though it is not usually found deeper than . It favors sandy or muddy bottoms in calm water, and is also sometimes encountered near rocky reefs or in estuaries, as it is tolerant of low salinity. Off the Azores, common stingrays are most abundant in summer and least abundant in winter, suggestive of a seasonal shift in range and/or depth as has been documented in other ray species. Description The common stingray has a plain coloration and mostly smooth skin. The common stingray has been reported to reach a width of and a length of , though a width of is more typical. The flattened pectoral fin disc is diamond-shaped and slightly wider than it is long, with narrowly rounded outer corners. The leading margins of the disc are almost straight and converge on a pointed, slightly protruding snout; the trailing margins of the disc are convex. The eyes are smaller than the spiracles (paired respiratory openings), which are placed closely behind. There are 28‚Äì38 upper tooth rows and 28‚Äì43 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small and blunt, and arranged into flattened surfaces. There are five papillae (nipple-like structures) across the floor of the mouth. The tail is slender and whip-like, measuring approximately half as long as the disc. A stinging spine with strong serrations, measuring up to long and equipped with a venom gland at its base, is positioned about a third of the distance along the tail. A second or even third spine may also be present, as the spines are regularly replaced and new spines grow in before existing ones have been shed. The tail behind the spine bears a low cutaneous fold on top and a short, deep fold underneath. The body and tail are smooth, save for a few dermal denticles on the leading edge of the disk; older individuals may also develop a row of bony knobs along the midline of the back. This species is a solid gray, brown, reddish, or olive- green above, and whitish below with dark fin margins. Young rays may have white spots. The largest recorded common stingray specimen was found in 2016 in the Izmir province of Turkey in the course of a study on trolling. Its fins had a width of , although its length could not be determined as the tail had been removed earlier. Biology and ecology The common stingray forages for invertebrates and small fishes on the sea bottom. Encountered singly or in \\"social\\" groups, the common stingray appears to segregate by sex to some degree and may be more active at night, tending to bury itself in sediment during daytime. It feeds on a wide variety of bottom-dwelling organisms, including crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It reportedly does great damage to cultured shellfish beds. One study in the Gulf of ƒ∞skenderun off Turkey found that crustaceans comprised some 99% of its diet, with fish prey becoming increasingly important with age. Another study off the coast of Tarsus, Turkey, found the most important dietary component to be the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus stebbingi, followed by the pistol shrimp Alpheus glaber and the swimming crab Charybdis longicollis; cephalopods were relatively important for males, while fishes were important for females. Common stingrays have been observed closely following each other in the presence of food, possibly to take advantage of other individuals' foraging success. The \\"fly\\" of a common stingray Like other stingrays, the common stingray is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which is later supplemented by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\", enriched with proteins, fat, and mucus) delivered by the mother through numerous extensions of the uterine epithelium called trophonemata. Females bear two litters of 4‚Äì9 pups per year in shallow inshore waters, following a gestation period of four months. Various authors have generally reported birthing in summer, between May and September or over a narrower timeframe such as July to August. Mature rays are known to aggregate off the Balearic Islands from mid- June to July, possibly for reproductive purposes. Newborns measure about across and long. Males reach sexual maturity at across, and females at across. The oldest known individual from the wild was ten years of age, but the species has lived up to 21 years in captivity. Known parasites of the common stingray include the flukes Heterocotyle pastinacae and Entobdella diadema, and the tapeworm Scalithrium minimum. Human interactions The serrated tail spine of the common stingray is potentially dangerous. Though not aggressive, the common stingray can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175‚Äì235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine was capable of killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172‚Äì210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules was said to have lost a finger to the bite of a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus. British zoologist Francis Day, in his 1884 The Fishes of Great Britain and Ireland, noted that the common stingray was not eaten because of its \\"rank and disagreeable\\" flesh, and that Welsh fishermen used its liver oil as a treatment for burns and other injuries. In the present day, the pectoral fins or \\"wings\\" of this species are sold smoked or dried and salted, and it is also utilized as a source of fishmeal and liver oil. The liver is regarded as a delicacy in French cuisine, and used to prepare dishes such as beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute. Common stingrays are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries across many parts of its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom longlines, beach seines, and trammel nets. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this ray is more susceptible to small-scale coastal fisheries than to industrial operations, such as in the Balearic Islands, where it makes up 40% of the shark and ray trammel net catch. Surveys indicate that common stingrays have declined in the Mediterranean and the northeastern Atlantic, and may have been extirpated from the Bay of Biscay. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened in those two regions, while the species as a whole is listed under Data Deficient. The common stingray is protected within five marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Balearic Islands, and also benefits from a European Union ban on the use of trawls within of the coast.

He admitted his role in the Chicago Outfit in federal court in 1995.  Chicago Outfit career  D'Amico was arrested for gambling in 1958 and 1968 and also for being a patron in an illegal card game in 1976. He also was involved in a fight at the corner of Oak Street and Rush Street, in Chicago, in 1978. He is related by marriage to Robert (Bobby the Boxer) Abbinatti, who is a made man in the Chicago Outfit. D'Amico has been arrested twice for DUIs, once in 1983 and another time in 1989. In the 1983 DUI, D'Amico was charged with aggravated battery in Palatine, Illinois for biting off a police officers finger during the DUI stop. However, the charges were dropped. For years, however, D'Amico was believed by organized-crime watchers to be the Chicago Outfit's top sports-gambling figure, and he was frequently spotted at funerals for top mob figures. On May 20, 1992, D'Amico was brought before a federal grand jury in Chicago after the bombing of a BMW sports car outside the home in Chicago's West Rogers Park neighborhood of Sharon Patrick, the estranged daughter of turncoat mobster Leonard Patrick, who was set to testify for the prosecution against his old boss, mob fixer Gus Alex.  Indictment, conviction and imprisonment  On November 18, 1994, with a five-year statute of limitations set to expire, D'Amico was indicted on charges of conspiring to commit robbery, operating sports bookmaking and poker businesses, using extortion to collect gambling debts and \\"juice\\" loans, and conspiring to commit racketeering. Also indicted were Richard lantini, who was D'Amico's top aide, and Robert Abbinanti, a truck driver for Chicago's Streets and Sanitation Department who is related to D'Amico by marriage. D'Amico, who was ordered held without bond, was accused of running an illegal sports bookmaking business from 1978 until 1992, operating an illegal poker business from 1980 until 1991, attempting extortion against corrupt former attorney Robert Cooley, who was cooperating with authorities and posing as a bookmaker, making \\"juice,\\" or excessively high, loans at rates of 2 percent a week, extorting \\"street taxes\\" from independent illegal bookmakers, and conspiring to rob a moving, high-stakes poker game near Lake Geneva, Wisconsin in late 1989. After being confronted with incriminating taped evidence and the cooperation of Cooley, D'Amico on May 1, 1995 pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to rob what he had been told was a high-stakes card game in Lake Geneva, in 1989 (in which the take could have been as much as $1 million), running a sports bookmaking business and a high-stakes poker game of his own for years, using extortion to collect gambling debts and \\"juice\\" loans, and extorting $1,000-a-month payoffs from former Chicago police officer Robert Cooley so Cooley could operate a poker game in a Chicago social club without mob interference. On October 3, 1995, United States District Judge Blanche M. Manning sentenced D'Amico to 12 years and 3 months in prison. During his sentencing hearing, D'Amico initially had demanded that the government prove that he was a ranking member of organized crime. However, federal prosecutors had been set to call as many as eight witnesses, including several former mob insiders, to testify that D'Amico was second-in-command in the Chicago Outfit's Elmwood Park \\"street crew,\\" under John DiFronzo. Instead, D'Amico abruptly backed off demands that the government prove that he was a \\"made member\\" of the Chicago Outfit, and signed a stipulation acknowledging his leading role with the Elmwood Park street crew and its link to the mob. By signing this stipulation D'Amico had admitted to his crimes and received a reduced sentence. D'Amico was released from federal prison on July 21, 2005.http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList;=false&FirstName;=Marco&Middle;=&LastName;=Damico&Race;=U&Sex;=U&Age;=&x;=98&y;=13  Later life  D'Amico lived for many years in South Barrington, Illinois. In the 1990s, he moved to Naperville, Illinois, where he lived with his daughter and son-in-law until he went to federal prison. Upon his release from federal prison, D'Amico moved to Westchester, Illinois, where he resided with his wife. D'Amico was married to his wife Patricia for over 50 years and has 4 children. D'Amico's cousin, a former Chicago Police Officer Roland \\"Ricky\\" Borelli, was part of D'Amico's gambling operation and was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to 10 months in federal prison.

Walrath *Company K: William Smith With the above officers, together with a full complement of lieutenants and ten hundred and forty enlisted men, the regiment broke camp at Fonda on 29 August, and was forwarded to the seat of war as soon as possible, arriving at Dandy Hook, Md. on the Baltimore and Ohio R. R., on 1 September, where the regiment was furnished with arms, but very little ammunition. It then moved on to Harper's Ferry, Va., where it was assigned to guard duty along the Shenandoah Valley R. R., with headquarters at Charlestown, Virginia. The regiment performed guard duty faithfully, until a few days before the surrender of Harper's Ferry, when it and others were ordered to concentrate at that place. On the way to the Ferry James English, a member of Company D, was wounded in the hand, by the accidental discharge of a musket, necessitating amputation at the wrist; he was the first man wounded in the regiment. On arriving at, or near Harper's Ferry, the regiment was encamped on Bolivar Heights, in the rear of the village. From this point it performed picket duty, and while so engaged, John Hubbard, of Co. A, was wounded by a guerrilla. On the 12th, Companies E and A were ordered to report to Col. Tom Ford, in command of Maryland Heights, and upon doing so, were ordered to proceed up the Potomac, to the old \\"John Brown\\" school-house, and form a skirmish line from the river as far up the mountain as possible, the left resting on the river. Early the next morning the two companies were ordered back to Ford's headquarters, and from there to Elk Ridge, at the Lookout, on the highest peak of the mountain. Here for the first time members of the 115th regiment met the enemy in deadly combat. After several hours fighting, and holding their position, the two companies were ordered to evacuate the place, and report to Gen. Miles' headquarters, which they did very reluctantly, and not until they had received the third order. Company E had one man wounded. About this time Company K moved up, and, in a few minutes its captain was carried to the rear, having been wounded in the thigh by a minie-ball. Upon nearing the foot of the mountain, at what was known as Maryland Heights, Companies E and A met the remainder of the regiment, who congratulated them upon their safe return. The regiment returned to camp on Bolivar Heights. The troops were kept moving to and fro until the morning of the 15th, when General Miles made one of the most cowardly and disgraceful surrenders recorded in the annals of American history. Eleven thousand men, armed and equipped in the best style, with plenty of ammunition, holding one of the most defensible positions in the United States, were ignominiously surrendered, instead of aiding to surround Lee's, Longstreet's, Hill's and Jackson's corps where there was no possible way of escape. Thus the Union army was reduced, and eleven thousand as good fighting men as ever shouldered a musket were doomed to bear the taunts of their enemies, at home and abroad, as \\"Harper's Ferry cowards.\\" But every regiment that was obliged to participate in that farce, and whose honor was sold by the commanding officer, has, upon bloody fields, won bright laurels, and vindicated its soldierly character. By the good graces of the rebel generals, who had the captured army as an \\"elephant on their hands,\\" the prisoners were paroled the next day, and allowed to depart in peace, which they did with sorrowing hearts. The regiment returned to Annapolis, Maryland, and thence went to Chicago, where it went into camp on the Cook county fair ground, which was called \\"Camp Tyler,\\" after the general in command of the troops around the city. During the stay of the 115th in Chicago its duties were about the same as those of troops in garrison, but the men were allowed rather more liberties than regular soldiers on duty. While at Chicago, the weather being very bad most of the time, and the men not on fatigue duty enough to give them healthy exercise, malarial fever caused the death of quite a number. About 20 November 1862, the regiment was ordered to proceed to Washington. The capital was reached about 23 November, and at the same time the soldiers of the 115th were exchanged and marched over to Arlington Heights. There they were supposed to go into winter quarters, but by the time quarters were built the regiment was ordered out again, and kept in motion between Arlington, Fairfax, Hunter's creek, Alexandria and Yorktown, where it embarked on the steamer \\"Matanzas,\\" 23 January 1863, and arrived at Hilton Head, S. C., Department of the South, about 26 January. Here the regiment was divided into detachments for post, camp and outpost duty. Companies E and D were detailed to garrison Battery Mitchell, an outpost on Scull creek. Company B was stationed at, Saybrook, and other companies at different points on and around Hilton Head Island, until 28 May, when the different detachments were relieved and the regiment was again a unit at Hilton Head. On 2 June, Companies E and B were, by order of General Chatfield, detailed for special field duty, and went with other troops up May River, S. C., and burned the town of Bluffton. About 27 June, the regiment was moved to the city of Beaufort, S. C., some twelve miles up Beaufort river, where it went into camp. After remaining here a while and suffering severely from malaria, incident to the dull routine life of the camp, the regiment was again divided into detachments and sent to do outpost and picket duty on Beaufort, Port Royal and other islands adjacent to them. On 20 December, the regiment embarked on transports for the old camp at Hilton Head, where it was attached to Gen. T. Seymour's \\"ill-starred\\" Florida expedition. The force left Hilton Head on 5 February 1864, reached Jacksonville on the evening of 7 February, and occupied the city without opposition. During the night of 8 February, the expedition reached Camp Finnegan, about twelve miles from Jacksonville, capturing a battery of six guns, a quantity of small arms, etc., and a large amount of provisions, upon which the boys feasted until next day, when, with well filled haversacks, they moved towards Tallahassee, reaching and occupying Baldwin without opposition, and reaching Barber's Plantation during the night. The next day the troops advanced to Sanderson's Station, where they burned the railroad depot filled with corn, and several resin and turpentine factories, and tore up considerable railroad track, burning ties and other property belonging to the rebels. By order of Gen. Seymour, the army fell back to Barber's Plantation and remained there until the 19 February. During this time the 115th, a part of the 4th Massachusetts cavalry and a section of the Third R. I. Flying Artillery were ordered to proceed to Callahan, a station on the Fernandina and Cedar Keys railroad, and capture whatever they might find, which was one pony, seven bushels of sweet potatoes, and one or two Florida hogs, of the kind that need to have knots tied in their tails to prevent their getting through cracks. Returning to camp, weary, footsore and hungry, the boys of the 115th were allowed to rest about one day, when the whole command broke camp early on the morning of 20 February, for the disastrous field of Olustee, known by the rebels as Ocean Pond. Upon arriving on the field the order of battle was formed, with the 115th on the extreme right of the infantry line, and the troops ordered to move forward, which they did with a steadiness that showed the 15,000 rebels that they had work to do. Upon arriving on a rise of ground between where the line was formed and the rebel position, the advancing force received a murderous fire, at which the colored troops on the extreme left broke very badly. The white troops upon the left began to double up on the 115th, but order was soon restored. About this time the rebels made a charge upon the Union right, which was repulsed by the 115th, who sent the enemy back over their works with heavy loss. The combat continued to rage with fury until the supply of ammunition on both sides gave out, and, night coming on, both parties were willing to call it a drawn battle; but Gen. Seymour, by ordering a retreat, gave the rebels to understand that he abandoned the contest. Upon this occasion Gen. Seymour took occasion to publicly compliment the 115th, giving it the honor and praise of saving his little army from total annihilation, and naming it the \\"Ironhearted Regiment.\\" The regiment lost over one-half its number in killed, wounded and missing. Col. Sammons was wounded in the foot at the commencement of the battle. Capt. Vanderveer was mortally wounded, and died in a few days. Lieuts. Tompkins and Shaffer were killed, besides many of the best non-commissioned officers and men. On leaving Olustee the expedition retraced its steps toward Jacksonville, where the 115th did picket and camp duty until 9 February, when the force embarked on transports for Palatka, Fla., about one hundred miles up the St. John's river from Jacksonville. Here the troops rested, and nothing of interest transpired. On 4 April, they again embarked on transports for Hilton Head, S. C., making a few hours' stop at Jacksonville, and arriving at their destination on the evening of 16 April. On 18 April the regiment sailed for Gloucester Point, Va., reaching that place on 21 April, and was attached to the 10th Army Corps. On 4 May it was attached to the Army of the James, under Gen. B. F. Butler. The army moved up the James river to Bermuda Hundred, and on 7 May, the 115th participated and suffered severely in the ill-fated battle of Chesterfield Heights, Va., losing about eighty in killed, wounded and missing, From this time to 16 May the regiment was marching, fighting, picketing, etc. On the morning of that day the disastrous battle of Drury's Bluff was fought. and the 115th regiment again brought into requisition under the immediate supervision of Gen. Adelbert Ames, who complimented it for its bravery and skillful movements, which saved Butler's army from total rout. On the 17 May the regiment went into camp at Hatcher's Run. From this time it was on picket duty all the time to 28 May, when it marched to City Point, and embarked on board the steamer \\"De Molay,\\" for White House, Va., landing there on 31 May at 4 P. M. The 115th took up the line of march for Cold Harbor, Va., reaching that place on 1 June, at 3:30, P. M., and immediately, with the rest of the brigade, charged the enemy's works, this regiment capturing two hundred and fifty men with their arms and equipment. Here the regiment was again complimented for bravery by Gen. Devens. From that time to 12 June, the regiment was under a continuous fire day and night. During the night of 12 June it marched for White House Landing, which place was reached at 6 A. M. the following morning. Next day the regiment embarked for City Point, landed at Powhattan, on the James, and marched the rest of the way. On the 23rd it moved up in front of Petersburgh, Va. From this time the regiment was in the trenches before Petersburgb, to 29 July, when Gen. Turner's division, to which the 115th was attached, moved to the left, to assist Burnside's 9th corps in the explosion of the mine, and charge upon the enemy's works. This occurred at 5 o'clock, on the morning of 30 July. The 115th again displayed its courage and cool bravery here by standing as a wall of fire between the advancing Rebels, and the partially demoralized 9th corps, and was again complimented by both Gens. Burnside and Turner. From Petersburgh the regiment marched to near City Point, and then to Bermuda Hundred, losing several men by sun stroke, as the weather was extremely hot, and the roads dry and dusty. Up to this time the regiment had been under fire for 37 days, and needed rest, which was had at Hatch's farm, until, on the evening of 13 August, the regiment broke camp and marched to Deep Bottom, on the north side of the James river, which was reached at 7 o'clock, A. M., on 14 August. That day and the next were occupied in marching and counter marching. On 16 August the enemy were found strongly posted at Charles City Court House, where fighting began at once and continued until the evening of 18 August, when the 115th was deployed and covered the retreat of the Union forces. In this affair the regiment lost eighty-four killed, wounded and missing. On the 20 August it returned to the old camp at Bermuda, with only one hundred and twenty men fit for duty. Comparative rest was the happy lot of the decimated regiment until 28 August, when it marched to Petersburgh again and occupied the trenches in front of that city. The regiment had a little rest, doing only trench and camp duty until 28 September, when it broke camp and marched to the north side of the James. On the 29 September the 115th participated in the capture of two redoubts on Chafin's farm, known by some as Spring Hill. Here the losses of the regiment were very severe, among the dead being the loved and lamented Capt. W. H. McKittrick, of Co. C. During this engagement in charges, counter charges, victories and repulses, the enemy lost three times the number that the 115th did. From this time to 27 October, the regiment was doing picket duty most of the time. On that day a reconnaissance was made in force on the Darbytown road, in front of Richmond, the 115th taking a prominent part in charging the rebel works, and losing quite heavily. Among the number killed was Sergeant lde of Company F., the idol of his comrades. Returning to camp, the regiment had five days comparative rest. On 8 December, the 115th embarked on board the propeller \\"Haze,\\" and participated in the abortive attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C. In the afternoon of 30 December, the regiment debarked at Jones' Landing, on the James river, Va., and just after dark was again in the old camp on Chafin's farm. On 4 January 1865, the 115th again embarked on board the Propeller \\"DeMolay,\\" on its second expedition against the keystone of the confederacy. The whole force was under command of Gen. Alfred H. Terry. The troops landed at Flay Pond battery, a short distance north of Fort Fisher, on the 13th at 9 A. M. The 115th lost but two or three men in landing. At 3 P. M. of the 15th, the grand charge was made upon the fort, the 115th bearing a noble part in its capture, and being again complimented by General Terry, also by Gen. Ames, who knew something of its fighting qualities while in the army of the James. The loss to the regiment was about 70, and among the killed was Lieut. S. S. Olney, of Co. F., whose loss to the regiment and company could not be made good. At about 8 o'clock, on the morning of 16 January, one of the magazines of the fort exploded, killing and wounding more of this regiment than the fighting of the day before. From this time to the surrender of Johnson's rebel army, the 115th was continually employed in fighting, marching, picket and guard duty, until it reached Raleigh, N. C., where it was assigned to \\"safe guard\\" duty in the city, from 23 April to 17 June, when it was mustered out of service. On the 19 June, the regiment left Raleigh for Albany, N. Y., where it was paid off by Paymaster C. F. Davis, on 6 July 1865 there being something less than two hundred of the original members. Upon leaving the U. S. Service, the men quietly returned to their homes and former vocations, and today the old 115th N. Y. Volunteer Infantry is represented in nearly every State in the Union, and almost every calling in life. However humble or exalted they may now be, if you speak of the camp, the bivouac, the fatigue, the march, the picket, the fight, and the campfires of years gone by, their eyes will kindle, and at the fireside they fight their battles o'er and o'er, until one could almost hear the roar of musketry, and the bursting of shells. But we must stop, for we can add nothing to the laurels already wreathed around the brow of one of the best of our country's defenders, the 115th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry. It only remains to add the following list of battles which were participated in by the regiment, or a part of it.

Sammons, in behalf of the regiment, presented to the State. The national ensign, a gift of the ladies of the XVth Senatorial district, 20 August 1862, showed service, the staff and three-fifths of the flag being gone. The regimental banner, presented by the state authorities while the regiment was at Fonda, of silk, with eagle and shield in the center, the national motto in a scroll beneath, and thirty-four stars in the field above, bearing the inscription, \\"115th N.Y. Vol. Regiment Infantry,\\" came out rent in the center and torn from side to side. A second and similar regimental banner survived in better condition, and with it was a new national flag inscribed with the names of the regiment's battles ; also two guidons of bunting. These flags were turned over to the adjutant general. They are represented by Lieut.-Col. N. J. Johnson, and are carried by Sergt. James English, who lost an arm while supporting them in the field. \\\\---- Information cited from the Montgomery County, New York -Official Website - which was derived from \\"The History of Montgomery and Fulton Counties\\" by F.W.

With an estimated 250,000 spectators during the 10 days, the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix is one of the largest vintage sports car race events in the United States. The race originated in 1983 and is now the longest-continually-running vintage road race in the nation, with an ever-widening national and international recognition as one of the premier vintage motorsports events. The race is the highlight of a 10-day Race Week. The opening weekend at Pittsburgh International Race Complex hosts the PVGP Historic Races for faster cars has become a significant race in its own right. The event at Schenley Park hosts 150 vintage racers, over 2,500 show cars and 200,000 weekend spectators. The street course, considered the most challenging on the vintage race circuit, traverses Schenley Park's Serpentine Drive and consists of a 2.33 mile circuit that has 23 turns, haybales, manhole covers, phone poles, and stone walls. 2018 marked the 36th consecutive year of the races with the signature event, the International Car Show and Vintage Races, through the streets of Schenley Park on the July 20/21, 2019 weekend. Since 1983 the event has donated over $5.5 million to autistic and developmentally disabled individuals throughout the Pittsburgh region. The Grand Prix has grown into a 10-day celebration of motorsports and in addition to two weekends of racing it now includes a blacktie gala, a road rallye, a downtown parade & car display, a Jet Center Party, Countryside Tour and three distinct car shows.

The family began with nine-cylinder engines, and later expanded to include five-cylinder and seven-cylinder varieties. Fourteen-cylinder twin-row versions were also developed, but these were not commercially produced. Description The Whirlwind was a direct descendant of the Lawrance J-1, a nine-cylinder air-cooled radial built by the Lawrance Aero Engine Company for the U.S. Navy. Because the Navy was very enthusiastic about air-cooled radials, but was concerned that Lawrance could not produce enough engines for its needs, it forced Wright to purchase the Lawrance company in 1923 and build the J-1 itself. Wright's J-1 was the first engine in its nine-cylinder R-790 Whirlwind series and was quickly followed by the J-3, J-4, J-4A, J-4B, and finally the popular and successful J-5 of 1925. In 1928, Wright replaced the R-790 series with the J-6 Whirlwind family, in which a supercharger was added to boost engine power and the cylinders were enlarged by expanding the bore. This family included three members: the nine-cylinder R-975, the seven-cylinder R-760, and the five-cylinder R-540, providing a range of different power levels using the same basic design. Of these, the R-975 proved the most popular, especially because of its use in armored fighting vehicles during World War II. During the mid-1930s, Wright also developed two fourteen-cylinder double-row versions of the Whirlwind, the R-1510 of , and the R-1670 of . These were used in a number of military aircraft prototypes, but neither engine reached the production stage.Curtiss- Wright (1940), p. 16Curtiss-Wright (1983), p. 5. (Page 4 may also be relevant but is unfortunately missing from the scanned copy linked below.) Air-cooled Whirlwinds were lighter and more reliable than liquid-cooled engines of similar power, since a liquid cooling system added weight and required extra maintenance. Thanks to these advantages Whirlwind engines were used widely and were built in large numbers. Licensed copies were produced by manufacturers such as Continental Motors, Hispano-Suiza, and adapted for Soviet government production by the Shvetsov OKB-19 design bureau. The Whirlwind's success led to the development of other air-cooled radial engines throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s and these gradually eclipsed most liquid-cooled aircraft engines.

The venue closed on 15 June 2015, following the sale of the real estate assets by Tortoni for $10 million to a developer intent on building an apartment complex on the site. Tortoni then sold the intellectual property of the club, including the employment of long-time manager Megan Evans, to entrepreneur David Marriner in June 2015. Marriner negotiated with the developer to retain the club at its original site until they were ready to begin works. The club reopened 10 weeks after initially closing, on August 27, 2015, with a performance by Yvette Johansson, and an updated interior, air conditioning, and sound system. During this time Marriner enlisted Evans' design studio, Brolly Studios, to design the new club at its future location in Flinders Lane, behind the Grand Hyatt, the plans for which were approved in 2016. The studios closed to allow space for the developer to install a display suite, and Flipboard Cafe, also onsite, continued to operate. Due to the club still operating, the opportunity to reconsider the design allowed Marriner and Evans to update their design. The new design was approved by the Melbourne City Council in 2019. The club vacated the Bennetts Lane site mid-February 2017, and closed on the 8th.

Active since the 1970s, he has over 70 film and television credits to his name. Coleby has acted on stage in numerous productions for the Queensland Theatre Company in Brisbane. Early life In his late teens, Robert lived in Edington, Somerset and went to Dr Morgan's School in Bridgwater. At that time he was influenced by the beat generation, novelist Jack Kerouac and singer/songwriter Bob Dylan and performed with acoustic guitar at folk music clubs in Bridgwater and Taunton. He enjoyed hitch-hiking in Europe during the school holidays, and worked in the peat fields near Shapwick to fund his travels. Early career Coleby's real name is Robert Taylor. Since there was already a famous actor of that name, Equity rules required that he choose another. Coleby's earliest screen role was in 1970, playing the role of Fortinbras in a TV version of Hamlet in the long-running US series Hallmark Hall of Fame, followed by a role as a hitchhiker in the 1971 US motion picture The Last Run which starred George C. Scott. During the next several years, he appeared in a number of TV productions in the UK, including five episodes of the 1973 children's series Pollyanna. Moving to Sydney, Australia, he made his debut on Australian TV appearing in an episode of the TV period drama Rush in 1976. Over the next two decades, Coleby became a regular face on Australian TV; he was a cast regular on several TV series including the roles; Dr Barrett in The Young Doctors in 1977; pilot Barry Drummond on Chopper Squad (1977‚Äì79); RAN officer Lt Fisher in Patrol Boat (1979‚Äì83); Reverend Lonsdale in the mini-series Anzacs (1985); and, businessman Tom Barsby in the short-lived soap opera, Paradise Beach (1993‚Äì94). Later career Coleby played Richard Craig in several episodes of the Australian medical drama All Saints between 2001 and 2004, and appeared as William Maplewhite in two episodes of The Lost World in 2001 and 2002. In 2005 he portrayed Rock Hudson in the fictionalised American television movie/docudrama Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure, based on the creation and behind the scenes production of the 1980s prime time soap opera Dynasty. Coleby played Alexander Preston in the 2006 American telenovela Monarch Cove, and Howard Webb in a 2006 episode of the Australian drama McLeod's Daughters. He later played Paul Devers in the 2007 American miniseries The Starter Wife. More recent theatre work includes the title role in the Queensland Theatre Company's 2007 production of the Henrik Ibsen play John Gabriel Borkman. In 2011, Coleby appeared in an episode of Terra Nova, titled \\"Proof\\", as Professor Ken Horton. He also appeared in WWE Studios The Marine 2, which was inspired by the 2001 Dos Palmas kidnappings.

It was the predecessor to American Eagle Airlines. Its headquarters were originally near Marquette, Michigan, at the Marquette County Airport in Negaunee Township, and were eventually moved to the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois.  History  Simmons Airlines, Inc. began operations in 1978 between Marquette and Lansing using a Piper Navajo. Operations expanded in the 1980s to link multiple points in Michigan to Chicago and Detroit, and its fleet expanded with Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, Shorts 360s, and YS-11s. It began operating as a Republic Express-branded carrier on April 28, 1985, (later Northwest Airlink) serving markets from Detroit, and as an American Eagle-branded carrier on October 1, 1985, serving markets from Chicago. Simmons was acquired by AMR Corp. on August 8, 1988, and ended Northwest Airlink flights soon after. On May 28, 1993, it acquired certain assets of the holdings of Metro Airlines. Metro and its holdings Metro Airlines Leasing (d/b/a Metroflight), operated American Eagle flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and had recently acquired Chaparral Airlines just prior the asset acquisition by AMR Simmons. In 1998 the remaining certificated regional airline carriers Wings West Airlines and Flagship Airlines, which were both wholly owned by the AMR Corporation and operating under the American Eagle banner and brand, were merged under the surviving Simmons Airlines IATA designator 'MQ', thus forming a certificated airline named American Eagle Airlines (rather than just an Airlink, Connect, Connection, Eagle, or Express airline codeshare brand). Incidents/accidents * January 19, 1979: A Simmons Piper Aerostar flying from Lansing to Marquette diverted to Kent County International Airport during freezing rain on January 19, 1979. The plane crashed as the pilot attempted to land, killing the pilot and three passengers and seriously injuring two passengers. * March 13, 1986: A Simmons Airlines flight 1746, an EMB-110P1, operating as a regularly scheduled flight, departed the Detroit Metropolitan Airport en route to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with a stop in Alpena, Michigan. The en route portion of the flight to Alpena was uneventful. However, due to the prevailing instrument meteorological conditions, the crew was unable to complete the instrument landing system (ILS) approach and land and they declared a missed approach at 2142. At 2153, the flight was cleared for a second ILS approach to Alpena. At 2156, the crew acknowledged that radar services were being terminated.‚Äô This was the last transmission from the airplane. About 22:15, a motorist reported that the airplane had crashed. The airplane was found in a wooded area about to the left of the extended centerline, and short of the threshold of runway 1 at Alpena County Regional Airport. The airplane was destroyed and two of the seven passengers and one of the two crewmembers on board were killed.NTSB Aircraft Accident Report (AAR) number AAR-87/02 . * October 31, 1994: American Eagle Flight 4184, an ATR 72 operated by Simmons Airlines, crashed near Roselawn, Indiana. The aircraft inverted, dived, and crashed from a holding pattern at 10,000 feet (3050 m) \\"after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots\\" resulting in an unexpected aileron hinge moment reversal that subsequently resulted in the loss of control. The four crew and 64 passengers were all killed. In the months following the accident, American Eagle redeployed its ATR fleet to Miami and the Caribbean where icing is not an issue. The aircraft manufacturer, ATR, has since improved the anti-ice boots. * July 9, 1995: American Eagle Flight 4127, an ATR 72 operated by Simmons Airlines, experienced a loss of the rear cabin entry door during its climb after taking off from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The cabin door opened shortly after the first officer began to pressurize the cabin; therefore, only a slight pressure differential existed between the cabin pressure and the atmospheric pressure. Lack of damage indicates the door was unlocked/unlatched when it opened. The airplane was one of fifteen aircraft equipped with a new handrail and door handle design which was different than the majority of the ATR 72 fleet. The old handle was pulled down to latch/lock the door and pushed up to unlatch/unlock the door. The direction of motion was reversed so that the handle was pushed up to latch/lock the door and pulled down to unlatch/unlock the door. A private citizen located the separated door in approximately two feet of water in the Des Plaines River on July 10, 1995. Following this incident, ATR designed another new door handle design which returns the handle motion to push up to unlatch/unlock, and pull down to latch/lock.

It is on the floor of the Eastern Rift Valley in southern Kenya, southwest of Nairobi along the road to Lake Magadi. Olorgesailie is noted for the large number of Acheulean hand axes discovered there that are associated with animal butchering. According to the National Museums of Kenya, the finds are internationally significant for archaeology, palaeontology, and geology. History Hand axes The artefacts were first discovered by the British geologist John Walter Gregory in 1919, but it was not until 1943 that excavation began in earnest under the direction of Mary and Louis Leakey, with the assistance of paroled Italian prisoners of war. Work continued there until 1947. Glynn Isaac took up the excavation in the 1960s for his dissertation. In the 1980s, research was continued by Richard Potts of the Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with the National Museums of Kenya. Finds Animal fossils from Olorgesailie Human tools are the most prominent of all historic items in the area. The abundant hand axes are characteristic of the Acheulean period, made by hominins between about 600,000 and 900,000 years agoalong what was then the shore of a now dried-up lake. Fossils of various animals have also been found, including those of extinct species of hippo, elephant, zebra, giraffe, and baboon, likely to have been butchered with the aid of the hand axes. In June 2003, a team led by Potts discovered a frontal bone in situ. Other parts of the small skull (designated KNM-OL 45500) were found in following months. The frontal bone is 900,000 to 970,000 years old and probably belonged to Homo erectus, thereby making it the first human fossil found on the site. The fossil remains were in the same stratigraphic level as two hand axes and several flakes, near dense deposits of hand axes. In 2018, evidence dating to about 320,000 years ago was found at Olorgesailie of the early emergence of complex and modern behaviors, possibly associated with early Homo sapiens, including: the trade and long-distance transportation of resources (such as obsidian), the use of pigments, and the possible making of projectile points. The emergence of these behaviors, it is observed by the authors of three 2018 studies on the site, approximately corresponds to the earliest known Homo sapiens fossil remains from Africa (such as at Jebel Irhoud, Morocco and Florisbad, South Africa) dated to about the same period, and it is suggested that complex behaviors began in Africa around the time of the emergence of Homo sapiens. Geology Preservation of the Aechulean hand axe culture was made possible by heavy falls of alkaline ash from volcanoes near the site; volcanoes that were active at the time. Mount Suswa and Mount Longonot are volcanoes and their vents are likely to have contributed to the ash that accumulated in the Olorgesailie basin. Subsequent sedimentation covering the site has preserved the fossils and created a stratigraphy which helps age determination. Existing temporary lakes and swamps give evidence of a humid climate during the middle Pleistocene. Sediments left by the lake cover an area of 50 square miles (about 130 square km). Of the artefacts, 99% were made from locally derived lavas, particularly trachyte, although small amounts of quartzite and obsidian have been found, indicating a transport over 16 to 40 km.

Symptoms The most common general symptom of having the spins is described by its name: the feeling that one has the uncontrollable sense of spinning, although one is not in motion, which is one of the main reasons an intoxicated person may vomit.Timothy Peck. FlockFinder.com: \\"Today's spotlight sermon on Addiction\\" The person has this feeling due to impairments in vision and equilibrioception. Diplopia (double vision) or polyplopia are common, as well as the symptoms of motion sickness and vertigo. CausesAlcohol= Ingesting a great deal of alcohol in a short amount of time causes alcohol to quickly enter the bloodstream. Mixing alcohol with normal soft drinks, rather than diet drinks delays the dizzying effects of alcohol because the sugary mixture slows the emptying of the stomach, so that drunkenness occurs less rapidly.CNN: \\"Food pairings: Working for or against you?\\" The dizzying effects of alcohol upset the fragile mechanism that the inner ear uses to balance.Mark Porter. Discovery Channel Ask the Expert: \\"Dr Mark Porter on giddy turns\\" > Balance in the body is monitored principally by two systems, both of which > are affected by alcohol sending abnormal impulses to the brain, [which tells > it] that the body is rotating, causing disorientation and making the eyes > spin round to compensate.treatment-now.com: \\"Alcohol\\" This \\"upset\\" has been seen in experiments in which human subjects were given clinical tests of the vestibular system before and after ingesting alcohol. The alcohol apparently causes the ampullary cupula in the semicircular canal to become lighter than the surrounding fluid (endolymph), which causes the system to become sensitive to gravity in addition to rotational acceleration. =Poly drug use=Cross fading Alcohol mixed with cannabis is known as herb and Al, and the intoxication name is known as cross fading. The spins are often reported when alcohol is mixed with cannabis, since both may cause dizziness and magnify each other's effects.Cindy Rich. Washingtonian: \\"Getting High\\" Smoking after drinking especially intensifies the effects of the alcohol, often resulting in nausea. Treatment and prevention Since at least some of the symptoms of \\"the spins\\" can be attributed to alcohol's disturbance of the vestibular system, many symptom relief strategies are based on increasing the body's ability to use other senses to regain balance. In addition to the vestibular system, vision and touch information from the body are extremely important in maintaining balance. In fact, the vestibular system is not necessary at all to maintain standing balance unless information from the other two systems becomes inadequate. Keeping one foot flat on the ground while trying to sleep is one popular self-treatment for people whose dizziness is exacerbated by lying down with eyes closed. There is no direct scientific evidence to support this treatment, however it is consistent with studies showing that postural balance responses to high and low speed tilts are primarily driven by force and velocity receptors in the muscles with relatively little input from the vestibular system. One way to mask the symptoms of the spins is to avoid staring at moving objects, such as people who are dancing or ceiling fans. Instead, it helps to stare at a non-moving object and slowly blink a few times. However, it will make things worse to keep one's eyes closed for an extended period. In minor cases of the spins, simply sitting alone in a quiet place or taking a walk is all it takes to make them subside. The best ways to avoid the spins are to continuously keep monitoring one's alcohol intake, which involves limiting one's intake to a reasonable leveladmin. Craig Hitchens Therapies: \\"Natural Hang Over Cure - Kind Of!\\" and to eat before drinking, which allows alcohol to be metabolized more efficiently and steadily and will keep one's blood sugar levels more even. Certain foods, such as crackers and cheese, have the right levels of carbohydrates, fat, and protein to help further slow the emptying of one's stomach. In popular culture Someone getting or having the spins is mentioned in several books, including: Being Irish by Joseph Keefe,Joseph Keefe. Being Irish] The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up by Delphine Hirsh, The Stranger Guide to Seattle by Paula Gilovich and Traci Vogel,Paula Gilovich & Traci Vogel. The Stranger Guide to Seattle Rag Man by Pete Hautman, The Tin Roof Blowdown by James Lee Burke.James Lee Burke. The Tin Roof Blowdown Visual depictions of the imbalance or dizziness associated with drunkenness were also featured in Mabel's Strange Predicament and other Charlie Chaplin movies. The cause of the spins is also described in Season 1, Episode 10 of the Netflix Original Series Marvel's Daredevil during a discussion between two main characters, Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson, after a night of drinking. Murdock confirms when asked by Nelson that he still gets the spins despite being blind due to disturbed equilibrium of the fluid in the inner ear. In the film Frances Ha, Benji tells Frances that placing one foot on the ground as she lies down on her bed will somewhat alleviate the spins. Later in the film, she teaches this new trick to her friend Sophie. The Pittsburgh rapper, Mac Miller's album K.I.D.S featured a track titled \\"The Spins\\". Danger Ronnie and the Spins associate this into their name and music. Rock musician Brian Head Welch references experiencing the spins during his time as an alcoholic and drug addict. He mentions the symptoms were particularly noticeable when laying down with his eyes closed. These references were made in his self-debuted album track \\"Flush\\". The Philadelphia band Modern Baseball make reference to the spins in their 2014 track Rock Bottom, from the album You're Gonna Miss It All.

The network's most recent broadcasts of the sport have fallen under Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Champions banner, and its most recent primetime broadcasts have been produced by sister pay television channel Showtime. History CBS' earliest experience with boxing dates back to 1948 with the debut of Pabst Blue Ribbon Bouts. The program, featuring blow-by-blow commentator Russ Hodges, lasted through 1955. CBS had a renewed interest in boxing after losing the National Football Conference package to Fox following the 1993 season. In 1994, they had a new series of fights on Saturday or Sundays under the Eye on Sports banner. Tim Ryan (blow-by-blow) and Gil Clancy (color) were the commentators during this period. CBS continued airing boxing on a somewhat regular basis until 1998, by which time they had the NFL (after acquiring the American Football Conference package from NBC) and college football back on their slate. On the afternoon of December 15, 2012, as part of a larger marathon of live boxing events being broadcast that day by sister premium network Showtime, CBS broadcast Showtime Boxing on CBS‚Äîwhich featured a main event between Leo Santa Cruz and Alberto Guevara from Los Angeles. The telecast, although delayed due to an overrunning college basketball game, was seen by approximately 1.5 million households. It marked the first live broadcast of a boxing event on CBS since 1997. In February 2015, CBS Sports reached a deal with Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Champions to air a series of eight, Saturday afternoon cards (branded as PBC on CBS). CBS Sports Network also aired shoulder programming for Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao. In 2016, CBS Sports Network began to pick up a larger number of events from smaller promoters such as Roy Jones Jr. and Pep Gomez. On June 25, 2016, as part of PBC, CBS broadcast Showtime-produced coverage of a card featuring a WBC welterweight championship fight between Keith Thurman and Shawn Porter, marking the first boxing event broadcast on CBS in primetime since 1978. The following March, CBS aired Thurman's welterweight unification bout against Danny Garc√≠a. =Notable moments= Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali's trainer, was brought in to be Sugar Ray Leonard's trainer and manager. Long-time coaches Janks Morton, Dave Jacobs and lawyer Mike Trainer made up the rest of Leonard's team. Promoted by ABC-TV as their replacement for the aging Ali, Leonard made $40,000 for his first professional fight (then a record) against Puerto Rican Luis Vega. The fight was televised nationally on CBS-TV, and the novice Leonard won by a 6-round unanimous decision. For decades, from the 1920s to the 1980s, world championship matches in professional boxing were scheduled for fifteen rounds, but that changed after a November 13, 1982 WBA Lightweight title bout ended with the death of boxer Kim Duk-koo in a fight against Ray Mancini in the 14th round of a nationally televised championship fight on CBS. Exactly three months after the fatal fight, the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 rounds. It was also the last fight to air as part of strike replacement programming on CBS because of the NFL strike, which ended three days later. A then 14-0 Oscar De La Hoya appeared on a December 10, 1994 card for CBS. The last time CBS aired a live boxing event prior to 2012, was on January 20, 1997, when then-middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins knocked out Glen Johnson in the 11th round. Commentators *Al Bernstein - In 1980, Bernstein joined ESPN as boxing analyst for the Top Rank Boxing series. He stayed at ESPN until 2003, and during that time he also worked as a reporter for SportsCenter, covering major boxing matches, Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NFL Draft. He also wrote and hosted the series Big Fights Boxing Hour for ESPN Classic. In 1988, he won the Sam Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting journalism and in 2012 he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.BWAA Awards International Boxing Hall of Fame It was announced in December 2012 that he would be inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame as one of their inaugural inductees in 2013 in the Media category. In 1992 and 1996, he served as the boxing analyst for NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympic Games. From 1999‚Äì2002, he was a sports anchor for KVVU news in Las Vegas. Since 2003, Berstein has served as the boxing analyst on Showtime for Showtime Championship Boxing. *Tom Brookshier *Joyce Brothers - Brothers gained fame in late 1955 by winning The $64,000 Question game show, on which she appeared as an expert in the subject area of boxing. Originally, she had not planned to have boxing as her topic, but the sponsors suggested it, and she agreed. A voracious reader, she studied every reference book about boxing that she could find; she would later tell reporters that it was thanks to her good memory that she assimilated so much material and answered even the most difficult questions.\\"Quiz Winner Credits Memory for Success.\\" Christian Science Monitor, 14 October 1959, p. 6 In 1959, allegations that the quiz shows were rigged began to surface, but Brothers insisted that she had never cheated, nor had she ever been given any answers in advance. Subsequent investigations verified her assertion that she had won honestly. Her success on The $64,000 Question earned Brothers a chance to be the color commentator for CBS during the boxing match between Carmen Basilio and Sugar Ray Robinson. She was said to be the first woman to ever be a boxing commentator.\\"CBS Radio to Give Male Fan Assist in Airing Basilio, Robinson Fight.\\" Hartford Courant, 25 March 1958, p. 18A *Gil ClancyHe has served as boxing analyst for CBS Sports for 20 plus years and currently calls the action for the network‚Äôs championship boxing series. *Brian Custer *Angelo Dundee - Dundee frequently went to other matches during his career to scout other boxers. During the first Joe Frazier vs. George Foreman bout in Kingston, Jamaica, on January 22, 1973, he sat near Howard Cosell, who was recording a call for ABC for a tape delay re-broadcast. He was overheard on the call noting that Frazier had been hurt before he was knocked down by Foreman the first time in the first round; Cosell mentioned it immediately before his famous \\"Down goes Frazier!\\" call. Later in the bout, Dundee was overheard pleading for the fight to be stopped as Frazier was repeatedly knocked down. The fight was finally stopped after Frazier was knocked down for the sixth time, with Foreman winning the bout‚Äîand the lineal World Heavyweight Championship‚Äîby technical knockout. *Ian Eagle - Eagle joined CBS in 1998 doing announcing work for NFL and NCAA basketball. He continues to serve these roles today. In 2010, he joined Dan Fouts to make up the number three broadcast team for CBS' NFL coverage. The pair was elevated to the number two slot behind Jim Nantz and Phil Simms in the 2014 season. Other CBS work includes boxing, The Pilot Pen Tennis tournament, the U.S. Open (both the late night show and daytime studio host for 2008 U.S. Open coverage), and the NCAA Track and Field Championships. *Phyllis George *Jim Gray *Kevin Harlan \\\\- On the network level, Harlan called NFL football for NBC in 1991, college football for ESPN in 1992-93, NFL for Fox from 1994-97, and joined Turner Sports in 1996 to cover NBA playoff games (he would begin calling games throughout the entire season in 1997, which he continues to do to this day). He began working for CBS in 1998. *Virgil Hunter *Ted Husing - At CBS, Husing took on a wide variety of events. In 1929, he was named studio director of WABC (the CBS flagship station) in addition to continuing his work as an announcer for the network. He was the original voice of the popular March of Time program and an announcer for shows such as George Burns and Gracie Allen. Above everything, his work on sports gave Husing the greatest prominence. He covered events as diverse as boxing, horse racing, track and field, regattas, seven World Series, tennis, golf, four Olympic Games, Indianapolis 500 motor racing, and especially college football. *Sugar Ray Leonard \\\\- Leonard has worked as a boxing analyst for ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, HBO and EPIX. His relationship with HBO lasted for more than a decade. It ended in 1990, after HBO was not offered an opportunity to bid on the telecast rights to Leonard's fight with Terry Norris. HBO believed it would be inappropriate for Leonard to continue with them if they couldn't bid on his fights. Leonard's attorney, Mike Trainer, said, \\"There never has been a linkage between his broadcasting and his fighting.\\" *Paulie Malignaggi *Brent Musburger *Jerry Quarry - Quarry retired for over two and a half years after the Norton fight. His career record was at 50-8-4 at this time, with 32 wins by KO. He had two losses each to Frazier and Ali plus one apiece to Norton, Chuvalo, Ellis and Machen to this point. He had been ranked as high as the #1 contender three times. Well- paid and very popular, it was an outstanding boxing career to this point. Arguably, Hall Of Fame caliber. At around this time, Quarry signed a contract with ABC (American Broadcasting Company) to be a boxing commentator. Quarry was very popular in this position, drawing the ire of Howard Cosell, an ABC commentator being pushed out of some work by Quarry. In mid-1977, a return match was being put together which would put Quarry in against a ranked heavyweight. The ranked heavyweight would be Italian Lorenzo Zanon. The match was to be televised on ABC, where Quarry was contracted. But both fighters signed to have the bout televised on CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System). When Quarry, who often negotiated his own fight contracts, signed the bout to CBS, he lost his ABC contract. *Mauro Ranallo - Ranallo provides commentary for three major combat sports: Showtime Championship Boxing, Glory Kickboxing, and Invicta Fighting Championships MMA. *Tim Ryan \\\\- Notable fights Ryan called include Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier, Floyd Patterson vs. Charlie Green, Floyd Patterson vs. Oscar Bonavena, Monroe Brooks vs. Bruce Curry, Bernard Hopkins vs. Glen Johnson, Thomas Hearns vs. Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard, and Ray Mancini vs. Duk Koo Kim. His color commentators for boxing were Angelo Dundee, Gil Clancy, and Sugar Ray Leonard. In 1986, Ryan won the Sam Taub Award for Excellence in Broadcasting Journalism.International Boxing Hall of Fame / BWAA Awards *Chris Schenkel - In 1956, he moved to CBS Sports, where he continued to call Giants games, along with boxing, Triple Crown horse racing and The Masters golf tournament, among other events. Along with Chuck Thompson, Schenkel called the 1958 NFL Championship Game for NBC. He was the voiceover talent for the first NFL Films production ever made, the 1962 NFL Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants. *Brent Stover *Pat Summerall \\\\- Summerall and his NFL on CBS commentating partner Tom Brookshier, called a heavyweight title fight between Muhammad Ali and Jean Pierre Coopman live in prime time on Friday, February 20, 1976. Brent Musburger and Phyllis George of The NFL Today co-hosted the telecast that night. Meanwhile, Don Dunphy supplied some commentary between rounds. A month earlier, CBS assigned Summerall and Brookshier to announce a Ken Norton bout against Pedro Lovell, a mere eight days before they called Super Bowl X. *Jack Whitaker - He entered network sports in 1961 at CBS, where he hosted the anthology series CBS Sports Spectacular among other duties. He worked for CBS for more than two decades. Whitaker is probably best remembered for his coverage of golf and horse racing. He covered thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown Events, golf's four major championships, the very first Super Bowl, championship boxing, the National Professional Soccer League in 1967,Maule, Tex. \\"Kickoff For A Babel Of Booters,\\" Sports Illustrated, April 24, 1967. the North American Soccer League a year later, and Major League Baseball.

The festivals are characterized by more than just music; many feature motivational speakers and evangelists, and include seminars on Christian spiritual and missions topics, service, and evangelism. They are often viewed as evangelical tools, and small festivals can draw 10 times the crowd of traditional revival meetings. While the central theme of a Christian festival is Jesus Christ, the core appeal of a Christian music festival remains the artists and their music. Critics point out that the dichotomy of business and religious interests can be problematic for Christian festivals. In similar ways as the Christian music industry in general, festivals can be drawn away from their central theme and gravitate toward commercialization and mainstream acts in an attempt to draw crowds. Creation Festival, 2007 Though Christian music festivals had been held prior to it, 1972 is seen as a pivotal year for Christian music due to the Explo '72 event, which was concluded by a massive music festival. Today Christian music festivals are held regularly throughout the United States and around the world. Christian music festivals were often supported by evangelical organizations; this is still true today, however, there are a number of free- standing festivals as well. Christian festivals are sometimes attached as secondary events to youth conferences, revival meetings, or billed as a part of a weekend package at theme parks. In 1999 the Gospel Music Association estimated the commercial revenue of Christian music festivals in the United States at approximately $22 million, with a combined attendance of over one- half million people. Christian music festivals continued to grow significantly into the 2000s, with the number of large festivals rising, and the formation of a representative organization for the festivals themselves. While counter- culture is generally accepted many attendees dress conservatively, and unlike their mainstream counterparts Christian music festivals are relatively free of alcohol and drug use. Even at the Explo '72 festival, which was attended by 150,000 or more people, police reported a trouble free event. In the United States In the early days of the Jesus People movement Christian events were sometimes held as part of secular music festivals. As the genre of Jesus music gained artists, its followers began to sponsor festivals, mimicking secular events such as Woodstock and Monterey Pop Festival. One of the first events, the Youth for Christ sponsored Faith Festival, was first held in 1970 in Evansville, Indiana. The event drew enough attention that the following year it garnered coverage by CBS and attracted about 15,000. Artists at the Faith Festival included Pat Boone, Gene Cotton, Danny Taylor, Crimson Bridge, and \\"e\\", a band which included Greg X. Volz. The attention that the Faith Festivals drew made them prototypes for future Christian music festivals. Also in 1970, Asbury Theological Seminary professor Robert Lyon founded the Ichthus Music Festival, which is presently the longest running Christian music festival. The Hollywood Free Paper, a publication about the Jesus people movement, sponsored festivals in California and other areas of the United States. In 1971 the \\"Love Song Festival\\", sponsored by Maranatha! Music, was held at Knott's Berry Farm. Attendance was reported to be 20,000, a park record at the time, and artists included Love Song, The Way, Blessed Hope, and the Children of the Day. In late 1971 Christianity Today summarized four festivals that had taken place during the summer season. The same article described the artists who appeared at a Santa Barbara, California event, including Gentle Faith, Tom Howard, Ron Salsbury, The Bridge, and Randy Stonehill, as being \\"veterans of Jesus rock festivals\\". 1972 is seen as a pivotal year for Christian music festivals due to a crusade and evangelism training event called Explo '72, held in Dallas, Texas. Explo was sponsored by the World Conference on Missions and Campus Crusade for Christ. The week-long event was attended by 80,000 registered attendees and concluded with a day- long music festival. The attendance of the final event was reported by Life magazine at 150,000For more reported attendance figures, see talk page. and was characteristic by Billy Graham as a \\"religious Woodstock.\\" The Explo '72 roster contained artists in a variety of genres including performers Larry Norman, Love Song, Andrae Crouch, and Johnny Cash. Explo '72 was a watershed event for the fledgling Jesus Music genre, and was the most visible event of the Jesus People movement. It is also the largest Christian music festival ever recorded; some critics even credit Explo with jump-starting the Christian music industry. Early Christian music festivals were noted for their conservatism, often limiting their artistic expression to \\"safe, middle-of- the-road acts.\\" The Jesus Festival, which was founded in 1973, offers a few illustrative incidents. In their inaugural year they hired a promoter, Tim Landis, who brought in acts such as 2nd Chapter of Acts, Pat Terry, and Phil Keaggy. The conservative owners, who wanted a family oriented music festival, found the music \\"a little too racy\\" and fired him. The following year at the same festival, Randy Matthews was chased off stage by a crowd which pronounced him to be demon or drug possessed due to his musical style and his announcement of an impending tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd and ZZ Top. Matthews was later dropped from the tour roster. The number and size of Christian music festivals continued to grow alongside the Christian music industry. By the mid 1970s festivals had appeared in all parts of the country. Tim Landis went on to found the Creation Festival in 1979, which was designed to appeal the youth, and has become one of the largest Christian festivals in the United States. For several years Creation was held at the same venue as the Jesus Festival, the Agape Farm, only a few weeks apart. More specialized festivals appeared to fill niche markets within the industry. The first completely rock music oriented festival was held in 1981. Called Illinois Jam, it featured artists including Barnabas, Servant, Randall Waller, and Randy Stonehill. Christian metal festivals also emerged, particularly in the late 1980s. One such festival was held in Carson, California in September 1987. The lineup was entirely Christian metal bands and included Guardian, Barren Cross, Vengeance Rising, and many smaller bands. Cornerstone main stage, 2007 While the members of Jesus People USA had long been involved in Christian festivals around the country, the Chicago organization founded the Cornerstone Festival in 1984. Seeing the trend toward conservatism, Cornerstone was designed to set itself apart by being artistically unrestrictive. Its design came from the counter- culture of JPUSA itself, with an intent to appeal to an audience that may not have been attracted to more conservative forms of music. As Cornerstone magazine editor Jon Trott later characterized it: \\"Cornerstone would be to Jesus festivals what Seven Up was to cola: the unfestival.\\" Their slogan in 1984 was \\"More Rock And Roll Than Anyone Has Dared\\"; Artists included Kerry Livgren, Resurrection Band, The Choir, Joe English, and the Sweet Comfort Band. Cornerstone was one of the premier Christian music festivals, and was most influential promoting groups on the fringe of Christian music. The last Cornerstone Festival was held in 2012, citing the difficult economy.A Special Announcement From Cornerstone Festival Cornerstonefestival.com. 2011-07-02. Retrieved 2013-09-21 The Alive Festival was founded in 1988 in Ohio and is one of the longest running three-day festivals with over 45 artists on three stages. In the 1990s the contemporary Christian music industry experienced explosive growth and saw the establishment of new festivals as well. The most significant of these are Purple Door and Tomfest, the latter of which regularly holds mini-festivals in diverse parts of the country. Since the turn of the century traveling tours such as Festival Con Dios and Shout Fest have appeared. They are often similar in structure to their secular counterparts such as Vans Warped Tour or Lollapalooza, offering extreme sports and a carnival-like atmosphere. Throughout the 2000s, the attendance at United States festivals grew significantly. According to one source, the number of Christian music festivals attended by more than 5000 youths grew from five in the year 2000 to 35 in 2006. As a result of this growth, many US festivals have formed a collective organization, the Christian Festival Association, to represent their interests. LifeLight Communications started an annual LifeLight Music Festival in 1998 which now occurs over Labor Day weekend on farmland near Worthing, South Dakota.Reinecke, Sarah. Lifelight attendance probably a record, financial goal close. Argus Leader. Sioux Falls, S.D.: Sep 8, 2010. Worldwide EO Youth Day in the Netherlands Christian music festivals now exist throughout the world. The Greenbelt festival, founded in 1974 in the United Kingdom, was at one time one of the largest recurring Christian events in the world. Germany is host to several festivals; four of the most notable are Christmas Rock Night, Freakstock, Himmelfahrt-Festival and Rock Without Limits. In greater Europe notable festivals include Flevo and EO-Youth Day in the Netherlands, Seaside Festival in Norway, the Big Boss' Festival in Switzerland, the Song of Songs Festival in Poland, Festival Lumen in Slovakia and Frizon Festival in Sweden. In 2014 the first Christian music festival is being held in Hungary (named Cross Sound). A sanctioned Christian festival was held in 1989 in Tallinn, Soviet Estonia. The festival featured performances by American artists such as Sheila Walsh, Bruce Carroll, Paul Smith, and Scott Wesley Brown, and had an attendance of 15,000. This was reported to be the first such festival. In 1992, after the Fall of the Iron Curtain, a Christian music festival was held in St. Petersburg, Russia. Dubbed as a \\"Christian arts festival\\", the event included acts to appeal to all ages from a variety of styles, largely representing greater Europe and North America. The event also included orchestras from the UK and Russia, and Russian headliner Boris Grebenshchikov. The shows, which were organized by Youth With A Mission, sold out 10,000 tickets well in advance. From 1992‚Äì2014, New Zealand hosted the Southern Hemisphere's largest Christian festival, the annual Parachute Music Festival. It attracted a large number of non- Christians. In Brazil, in the city of Fortaleza, Cear√° annually happens Halleluya Festival, which brings together music from the various attractions theatrical performances and dance.

Stac Dh√≤mnuill Chaim, or Stac Dh√≤mhnaill Chaim, is a fortified promontory located near Mangursta (or Mangersta, Scottish Gaelic: Mangarstadh) on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The stack and its surrounding site is listed and protected as a scheduled monument, one of about 8,000 sites currently protected in Scotland. The site of the stack is located at . The site is named after Donald Cam Macaulay, the early 17th century hero of the Macaulays of Uig. The site was documented in the late 19th century, but today it is considered inaccessible. In 2003 and 2006, an archaeological team of rock climbers scaled the promontory and documented the site; finding in 2006 a piece of possibly Neolithic pottery. Overview Stac Dhomnuill Chaim when translated from Scottish Gaelic means \\"One-eyed Donald's stack\\". It is a promontory fort located near Mangursta on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides (grid reference ). It is said to be the traditional refuge of the early 17th century Uig hero Donald Cam Macaulay, who was a chieftain of the Macaulays of Lewis. The 19th-century historian F W L Thomas stated that there were stories in Uig that recounted how Donald Cam's daughter, Anna Mh√≤r (\\"big Anne\\"), would carry water to her father upon her head because her hands were required to climb the treacherous path to the top. Description of the site Stac Dhomnuill Chaim was documented in the late 19th century by the historian F W L Thomas who stated it was high and no more than long at the top. He described the promontory as almost cut off from the nearby shore by a very deep ravine, though it remained connected to the mainland by a rocky isthmus. The stack which is surrounded by the sea, was completely inaccessible except from the land side by a narrow path. According to Thomas this was guarded by to thick wall on the land side, in which there was a gap or gateway on the southern side. Upon the stack, Thomas described the remains of a cottage measuring long and wide, with walls that are thick. Connected to the cottage were the remains of a sheep pen. Captain F W L Thomas's plan of the site, published posthumously in 1890. In July 1969, the site was visited by a Field Investigator of the Ordnance Survey's Archaeology Division. By then the narrow path across the isthmus had deteriorated because of cliff falls and the site was considered to be inaccessible. The Investigator's observations from the opposite cliff concluded that the site seemed to appear as Thomas's plans had showed it in the late 19th century. In 1992, Stac Dhomnuill Chaim was added to the list of scheduled monuments and in consequence was given legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The area protected is irregular shaped, measuring a maximum of northeast-southwest by northwest-southeast. There are about 8,000 scheduled sites protected within Scotland. On the list the site is classified as \\"secular\\". In 2003, the site was visited by members of the Severe Terrain Archaeological Campaign (STAC). At the time it was clear to the team that the coast was rapidly eroding the site. The building upon the site were also documented. The remains of structure A are of a circular, turf and stone building measuring to about in diameter. The structure adjoins the perimeter wall (structure C) on the north-east edge of the stack. The structure has no apparent entrance. Structure B is the remains of a sub- rectangular turf and stone building, measuring by externally and by internally. The building occupies the centre of the stack and is separated from structure A by a narrow gap, which would likely have been wider before the deterioration of the structures. Structure B also has no apparent entrance. Structure C is the perimeter wall which is constructed of turf and stone. It extends from the northern end of the stack, down to the eastern side, to its southern end. The wall is hard to define at the southern end, though it is possible that it encloses two terraces on the south end of the stack. At the southern end of the second terrace there are the faint remains of a possibly earlier wall. It is possible this wall could represent an earlier and longer phase of the perimeter wall. Later in 2006, the site was visited by a local descendant of Dhomhnuill Chaim in conjunction with the STAC. During this visit a large piece of pottery was discovered which has since been identified as early prehistoric and possibly Neolithic.

Life and work Eduard van der N√ºll was born and died in Vienna. After studying at the Vienna Polytechnical Institute (alongside, among others, Peter von Nobile, Paul Wilhelm Eduard Sprenger and Carl Roesner), he and his friend August Sicard von Sicardsburg made extensive trips through Western Europe for purposes of study. In 1844, he became a professor at the Academy with a new Chair created for him in Perspektive und Ornamentik (perspective and ornamentation). He remained associated with Sicardsburg for life, in a professional and artistic symbiosis. While Sicardsburg handled primarily practical and technical questions, van der N√ºll was responsible for issues of decoration and aesthetics. Their first joint project was in 1847, creating the Carltheater in Vienna-Leopoldstadt (since destroyed). In the 1850s they added some sections to the Vienna Arsenal, such as the command building whilst Van der N√ºll was solely responsible for the interior design of the Altlerchefelder Parish Church, the most important church project of the decade. Their most important joint project, however, was the Vienna Court Opera (Wiener Staatsoper) in the style of the Neo-Renaissance, during 1861-1869, built as the first public building along the Vienna Ringstrasse. In 1860, the project had been submitted to competition and won by the two architects. Their design failed to match the monumentality of the Heinrichshof opposite (destroyed in World War II, and in 1955 replaced by the Opernringhof). Criticism from both the Emperor and a press campaign against the pair of architects described the disappointment of the Viennese public and suggested that the building was merely a half-success. After the street level in front of the opera house was raised by a metre, the opera was described as the \\"sunken chest\\" and - in analogy to the military disaster of 1866 - \\"the K√∂niggratz of Construction\\". Eduard van der N√ºll was deeply troubled by the criticism and hanged himself on 4 April 1868. His partner Sicardsburg died nearly 10 weeks later, diagnosed with tuberculosis. It was said that the Emperor had been so shocked by the suicide of Eduard van der N√ºll, that from then on he responded to all new art phenomena with the standard phrase, \\"It was very beautiful, I liked it a lot\\". Eduard van der N√ºll was buried in an honorary grave in Vienna's Central Cemetery (Group 32 A, No. 5). In 1875, the Van-der-N√ºll street in the Favoriten District of Vienna was named after him.

It is located in the Black Mountains. Gower Gulch is visible from Zabriskie Point and is about one and a half miles long. History Gower Gulch is named after Harry P. Gower, an official of the Pacific Coast Borax Company and co-owner of the Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch, before Death Valley became a national monument. The gulch contained mines, camps, and roads during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Geology Gower Gulch passes through three geological formations: *the Badlands in the easternmost portion *the Artist's Palette Formation mid channel *the Playa Formation at the channel head. There are two areas of dry waterfalls: the Upper Knickzone near Zabriskie Point and the Lower Knickzone near the gulch's Alluvial fan. The tallest fall, at the head of the alluvial fan, is approximately 25 ft. high, the only way around it being a ledge on the northern side of the fan. The alluvial fan has a deep channel, called a telescoping channel, that runs north-west from Gower Gulch's mouth. Mining Gower Gulch was mined in after the 1880s, when a road starting at the northern side of Zabriskie Point was built by the Pacific Coast Borax Company. This road allowed wagons and autos to reach the ten borax mine claims in the gulch. many of these mines are still visible today, though mines on the floor bed of Gower Gulch have been filled in with sediment from past floods. Diversion In 1941 a Furnace Creek-Gower Gulch Flood diversion channel was blasted upstream from Zabriskie Point to divert flood waters from the Furnace Creek Wash and the resorts into Gower Gulch. The diversion increased the size of Gower Gulch's drainage basin from 2.77 km2 to 455.63 km2, an increase of 16,348%. As a result, massive erosion of the channel took place as debris from Furnace Creek were channeled into Gower Gulch. Today the diversion has sunk to over 20 feet deep with two dry falls, one three feet and another ten feet high.

Her younger brother is the statistician Andrew Gelman of Columbia University. Education She received her B.A., Psychology and Classical Greek from Oberlin College in 1980, and her Ph.D. in Psychology, with a Ph.D. minor in Linguistics from Stanford University in 1984. Her PhD advisor was Ellen Markman. She studies concepts and language in young children and is the author of over 200 publications in psychology research or related articles.  Research areas and topics of interest  * Developmental psychology * Cognitive development * Language acquisition * Categorization and inductive reasoning * Psychological essentialism * Social categories; Ownership, Authenticity, and Object history * Parent-child conversations * Semantic development * Causal reasoning * Relations between language and thought Essentialism Gelman has been a major contributor to essentialism and relating essentialist ideas to varying aspects in the field of psychology. A large number of her publications and contributions have associated essentialism and involved how its ideas can provide further insight into the field of psychology. Gelman's work within the two fields share a familiar subsection which focuses on the developmental aspect of children. Her work has established that children, within a given age range, are able to detect underlying essences or root causes for predicting observed behaviors. Gelman's role in the furthering of psychological knowledge in regards to child development has given insight into how children acquire language and the thought processing that goes into such acquisitions can be exemplified through her contributions to published works. The Conceptual Development Lab The Conceptual Development Lab is directed by Gelman and is located in the Psychology Department at the University of Michigan. Most of the studies conducted at the lab focus on children between the ages of 2 and 10, and are carried out in a home-like laboratory setting or in local preschools and middle schools. Awards J. S.

It is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella organisation for British Unitarians. It is in the form of a Greek cross and was built in 1692 or earlier. It is a Grade II* listed building. It is thought to be the first brick building of any size in York with load-bearing brick walls. A major benefactor was Lady Sarah Hewley, a Protestant dissenter and widow of Sir John Hewley, MP. Lady Hewley also founded almshouses in Tanner Row in York, which were moved by the railway in 1839 to be the present Lady Hewley Almshouses in St Saviourgate. There are also twelve almshouses known as Colton's Hospital in Shipton Street. The most famous minister of the Chapel was Charles Wellbeloved, who was at first assistant to the Rev. Newcome Cappe and then minister until his death in 1858. He was involved in saving the York city walls from being used to provide building materials, ended malpractices at York County Lunatic Asylum, founded the York Mechanics' Institute, wrote a guide to York Minster and initiated an appeal after a fire destroyed a Minster screen.

Berwick is characterized by its warm nature and welcoming community atmosphere, as well as its diverse population, including significant numbers of African American and Jewish citizens. The median household income is higher than the state average at $51,048, and the average household net worth is $509,793. The median age of residents is 52. Notable Columbus citizens, including Heisman Trophy Winner Archie Griffin and Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman, have resided in the area.  History  Homes started being built in Berwick in 1927. Within a few years of the completion of the project, the town experienced a population boom at the beginning of the 1950s. A few years after this population boom, the neighborhood experienced some racial tension. Bruce Black, former president of the Berwick Civic Association states, \\"The neighborhood had some racial growing pains in the early 1970s as African- American families migrated to the area. Some white families moved, fearing their property values would plummet,\\" In 2015, Berwick garnered national attention as a result of a recent scandal involving Bob Hsieh, an employee of the Columbus Development Department. Hsieh was accused of dishonesty, misuse of property and failure of good behavior after he helped Jianhua Li, a Chinese businesswoman, purchase Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman‚Äôs Berwick home; an act committed without the authorization of his business. He hired lawyers, established bank accounts, and paid someone to maintain the property in an effort to make the house more desirable.  Geography  Berwick is situated between Interstate 70 and Bexley, Ohio. The border of Berwick is Livingston Avenue to the North, James Road to the East, and Interstate 70 to the South and West. The population is currently set at 4,322 according to the 2015 census Most of the neighborhood is relatively flat. The area contains many spacious ranch houses and suburban streets that weave around the remains of the Berwick Golf Course and through the neighborhood. Berwick is roughly nine square miles. The town is located four miles east of downtown Columbus, providing Berwick residents with a close commute to downtown.  Culture  This neighborhood has grown since 2009 because of its diverse mix of cultures, affordable housing and overall location in relation to the rest of the metropolitan area. The population according to census 2015 data rose from 4,160 in 2009 to 4,322 in 2015. A recent analysis of the population of Berwick by Realtor.com stated, \\"70% of people are married and 30% of people are single. The percent of people married is 2% lower than the ratio of Columbus Metro at 72%. In Berwick, the male-to-female ratio is 1,918 to 2,405, which is 17% lower than the ratio of Columbus Metro at 979,841 to 1,013,818. Age demographic data is sourced from census, 2015.\\"  Residential  It is slightly cheaper to live in Berwick rather than the city of Columbus because the cost of living is lower by three percent. In addition to that, housing costs are also ten percent lower than the rest of Columbus. The average cost of a one-bedroom apartment is approximately $660 per month, compared to an average of $765 per month in Greater Columbus. As of 2015, over 1,800 homes have been built in Berwick. Recent studies have shown that Berwick is a much safer area than many of the other neighborhoods of Columbus. An analysis of crime in Columbus based on 2015 census data showed that, \\"Berwick has 36% less property-based crime than Columbus, and is 68% above the national average. Berwick also claims 20% less personal crime than Columbus and when compared to that of the United States average, Berwick experiences 54% less personal crime.\\"  Education  All Saints Academy Berwick's educational system is split between local schools and the larger Columbus City School District. Schools located in Berwick include Berwick Alternative K-8 School and All Saints Academy, a private kindergarten through eighth-grade school with about 275 students, located at 2855 E. Livingston Ave. in the neighborhood. In Berwick, 13% of residents 18 and over graduated with only a high school diploma and 47% completed a bachelor's degree or higher, which is 10% higher than that of Columbus Metro.  Transportation  The main form of transportation in this area is driving, as most of the residents own cars. Another alternative is walking along the sidewalks. Some areas do not have sidewalks, so walking is typically reserved to certain areas. There are no bike lanes, so cyclists will have trouble traveling through the neighborhood. The Columbus metropolitan is very accessible for drivers via Route 33 on the west side of the neighborhood. Route 33 and Interstate 70 connect with each other, allowing the driver to go east or west. One other option a resident has is taking the COTA bus, which offers $2.00 one way passes across town and $4.50 full day passes.  Landmarks & Structures  Berwick Park, a four-acre park tucked away in a quiet neighborhood street, is one notable landmark in the community. The open field provides residents with a quiet place to relax, take a walk, or read. The park often hosts many cultural and educational events. Another landmark is the Leo Yassenoff Jewish Community Center, which serves all of Columbus. It offers multiple educational and religious programs to the community. According to the website, their mission states, \\"It is committed to enhancing the quality of individual and family life through the promotion of physical, intellectual and spiritual wellness.\\"  Entertainment & Dining  Tat Ristorante di Famiglia Residents have a limited number of options dining out because Berwick is predominantly residential. TAT Ristorante di Famiglia, which was opened in 1929 on the corner of College and Livingston Avenues, claims to be the oldest Italian restaurant in the city. Papa Pete and Mama Philomena serve a wide range of Italian favorites, including fresh veal piccata, chicken cacciatore, and steak Sicilian, all of which are prepared from family recipes. Another famous restaurant located in Berwick is simply called \\"The Berwick.\\" It was created by Tony and Maria Susi in 1955, so it is much younger than TAT Ristorante di Famiglia. But the restaurant boasts continually trying new recipes to create the best tasting Italian Food. They also cater to weddings of any size as well as banquets. The restaurant has received numerous positive reviews on TripAdvisor and WeddingWire. Located nearby in downtown Columbus, there are three downtown theaters ‚Äì the Ohio Theater, The Columbus Palace Theatre, and the Southern Theater. The theaters are all live venues that host musicians, stand-up comedians, off-Broadway productions, and symphonies, and other events.

Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the HTTP. The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases shown are typical, but any human- readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes. All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role. There are five classes defined by the standard: * 1xx informational response ‚Äì the request was received, continuing process * 2xx successful ‚Äì the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted * 3xx redirection ‚Äì further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request * 4xx client error ‚Äì the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled * 5xx server error ‚Äì the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request 1xx informational response An informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. It is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes, servers must notItalicised words and phrases such as must and should represent interpretation guidelines as given by RFC 2119 send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions. ;100 Continue : The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send \`Expect: 100-continue\` as a header in its initial request and receive a \`100 Continue\` status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it should not send the request's body. The response \`417 Expectation Failed\` indicates that the request should be repeated without the \`Expect\` header as it indicates that the server does not support expectations (this is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers). ;101 Switching Protocols : The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so. ;102 Processing (WebDAV; RFC 2518) : A WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, requiring a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost. ;103 Early Hints (RFC 8297) :Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message. 2xx success This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood, and accepted. ;200 OK : Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action. ;201 Created : The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource. ;202 Accepted : The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs. ;203 Non- Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1) : The server is a transforming proxy (e.g. a Web accelerator) that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the origin's response. ;204 No Content : The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning any content. ;205 Reset Content : The server successfully processed the request, asks that the requester reset its document view, and is not returning any content. ;206 Partial Content (RFC 7233) : The server is delivering only part of the resource (byte serving) due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by HTTP clients to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams. ;207 Multi-Status (WebDAV; RFC 4918) : The message body that follows is by default an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made. ;208 Already Reported (WebDAV; RFC 5842) : The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a preceding part of the (multistatus) response, and are not being included again. ;226 IM Used (RFC 3229) : The server has fulfilled a request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance- manipulations applied to the current instance. 3xx redirection This class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in URL redirection. A user agent may carry out the additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent may automatically redirect a request. A user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects. ;300 Multiple Choices : Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven content negotiation). For example, this code could be used to present multiple video format options, to list files with different filename extensions, or to suggest word-sense disambiguation. ;301 Moved Permanently : This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI. ;302 Found (Previously \\"Moved temporarily\\") : Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL. 302 has been superseded by 303 and 307. This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was \\"Moved Temporarily\\"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303. ;303 See Other (since HTTP/1.1) : The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a new GET request to the given URI. ;304 Not Modified (RFC 7232) : Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy. ;305 Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1) :The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response. For security reasons, many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer) do not obey this status code. ;306 Switch Proxy : No longer used. Originally meant \\"Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy.\\" ;307 Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1) : In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI. In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the original request. For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request. ;308 Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538) : The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviors of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly. 4xx client errors 404 error on wikipedia This class of status code is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user. ;400 Bad Request : The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). ;401 Unauthorized (RFC 7235) : Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means \\"unauthorised\\", the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource. : Note: Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website. ;402 Payment Required : Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not widely used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests. Sipgate uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call. Shopify uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is temporarily disabled. Stripe uses this code for failed payments where parameters were correct, for example blocked fraudulent payments. ;403 Forbidden : The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action. This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication by answering the WWW-Authenticate header field challenge, but the server did not accept that authentication. The request should not be repeated. ;404 Not Found : The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible. ;405 Method Not Allowed : A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form that requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource. ;406 Not Acceptable : The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request. See Content negotiation. ;407 Proxy Authentication Required (RFC 7235) :The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. ;408 Request Timeout : The server timed out waiting for the request. According to HTTP specifications: \\"The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time.\\" ;409 Conflict : Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the resource, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates. ;410 Gone : Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a \\"404 Not Found\\" may be used instead. ;411 Length Required : The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource. ;412 Precondition Failed (RFC 7232) : The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request header fields. ;413 Payload Too Large (RFC 7231) : The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called \\"Request Entity Too Large\\". ;414 URI Too Long (RFC 7231) : The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request. Called \\"Request-URI Too Long\\" previously. ;415 Unsupported Media Type (RFC 7231) : The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format. ;416 Range Not Satisfiable (RFC 7233) : The client has asked for a portion of the file (byte serving), but the server cannot supply that portion. For example, if the client asked for a part of the file that lies beyond the end of the file. Called \\"Requested Range Not Satisfiable\\" previously. ;417 Expectation Failed : The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field. ;418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324, RFC 7168) :This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The RFC specifies this code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee. This HTTP status is used as an Easter egg in some websites, such as Google.com's I'm a teapot easter egg. ;421 Misdirected Request (RFC 7540) : The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response (for example because of connection reuse). ;422 Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV; RFC 4918) : The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors. ;423 Locked (WebDAV; RFC 4918) : The resource that is being accessed is locked. ;424 Failed Dependency (WebDAV; RFC 4918) : The request failed because it depended on another request and that request failed (e.g., a PROPPATCH). ;425 Too Early (RFC 8470) :Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed. ;426 Upgrade Required : The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0, given in the Upgrade header field. ;428 Precondition Required (RFC 6585) :The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict. ;429 Too Many Requests (RFC 6585) :The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. Intended for use with rate- limiting schemes. ;431 Request Header Fields Too Large (RFC 6585) :The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field, or all the header fields collectively, are too large. ;451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons (RFC 7725) : A server operator has received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the requested resource. The code 451 was chosen as a reference to the novel Fahrenheit 451 (see the Acknowledgements in the RFC). 5xx server errors The server failed to fulfill a request. Response status codes beginning with the digit \\"5\\" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. Likewise, user agents should display any included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any request method. ;500 Internal Server Error : A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable. ;501 Not Implemented : The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API). ;502 Bad Gateway : The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server. ;503 Service Unavailable : The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).

The term dyke is a slang term, used as a noun meaning lesbian and as an adjective describing things associated with lesbianism. It originated as a homophobic and misogynistic slur for a masculine, butch, or androgynous girl or woman. While pejorative use of the word still exists, the term dyke has been reappropriated by out and proud lesbians to imply assertiveness and toughness, or simply as a neutral synonym for lesbian. Origins and historical usage The origin of the term dyke is obscure and many theories have been proposed. Most etymologies assert that dyke is derived from bulldyke, which has a similar meaning. The term first appears in an August 1921 article in the journal Medical Review of Reviews titled \\"The 'Fairy' and the Lady Lover\\". In this article, Perry M. Lichtenstein, a prison physician in New York City, reports on the case of a female prisoner he examined: \\"She stated that she had indulged in the practice of 'bull diking,' as she termed it. She was a prisoner in one of the reformatories, and there a certain young woman fell in love with her.\\" The forms bulldyker and bulldyking also appear in several Harlem Renaissance novels of the 1920s, including Eric D. Walrond's 1926 Tropic Death, Carl van Vechten's 1926 Nigger Heaven, and Claude McKay's 1928 Home to Harlem. In these novels the term is used as African-American vernacular speech. The Oxford English Dictionary notes the first attestation as Berrey and Van den Bark's 1942 American Thesaurus of Slang, which lists bulldiker as a synonym for lesbian.. The etymology of bulldyke is also obscure. It may be related to the late-19th-century slang use of dike (\\"ditch\\") for the vulva.. Bull (\\"male cattle\\") being used in the sense of \\"masculine\\" and \\"aggressive\\" (e.g., in bullish), a bulldyke would have implied (with similar levels of offensiveness) a \\"masculine cunt\\". Other theories include that bulldyke derived from morphodite, a variant of hermaphrodite; that it was a term for stud bulls and originally applied to sexually successful men;. or that it was a dialectical corruption of the name of the rebel Celtic queen Boadicea. From the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, dike had been American slang for a well-dressed man, with \\"diked out\\" and \\"out on a dike\\" indicating a young man was in his best clothes and ready for a night on the town. The etymology of that term is also obscure, but may have originated as a Virginian variant of deck and decked out.. In the 1950s, the word dyke was used as a derogatory term for lesbians by straight people, but was also used by lesbians of higher social status to identify crude, rough-bar lesbians. In a 1970 study, Julia Stanley theorized that the source of these varying definitions stems from gender-determined sub-dialects. Homosexuality in America is a ‚Äúsubculture with its own language.‚Äù As such, a special vocabulary is developed by its members. Previously, male homosexuals defined dyke as lesbian without derogation. A bull dyke was also defined as a lesbian without further distinction. For female homosexuals of the community, however, a dyke is an extremely masculine, easily identified lesbian, given to indiscretion. Bull dyke is an extension of this term, with the addition of this person described as nasty, obnoxiously aggressive, and overly demonstrative of her hatred of men. In 1995, Susan Krantz discussed the etymology of bulldyke, with derivations of the Middle English \\"falsehood\\" for bull and dick for dyke (Farmer and Henley 1891). Therefore, a possible origin for a masculine lesbian comes from bulldicker that could specifically mean \\"fake penis\\", denoting a \\"false man\\". Further speculation talks of the synonymous term bulldagger. Here, dagger also alludes to the male genitalia and bull referring to \\"false\\" rather than \\"man\\". Increasing acceptance Boston Dyke March (2008), Massachusetts, USA. Dykes on Bikes banner (2006). Melbourne Gay Pride, Australia. In 1969, people in the gay community began to march in the streets to demand civil rights. Terms such as dyke and faggot were used to identify people as political activists for the gay community. During this time, dyke referred to a woman committed to revolution, the most radical position. A surge of feminism in the lesbian community led to \\"dyke separatism\\", which emphasized that lesbian women should consider themselves to be separate from men, their ideas and movements. In 1971, the poem The Psychoanalysis of Edward the Dyke by Judy Grahn was published by the Women's Press Collective. This use of dyke empowered the lesbian community because heretofore it had only been employed as a condemnation. Because of the exposure of the word to the public, the term dyke was reclaimed by the lesbian community in the 1970s. The meaning of dyke has positively changed over time. Most members of the community have dropped bull from the term to use it as a positive identifier of one who displays toughness, or as a simple, generic term for all lesbians. This abbreviation does not carry the negative connotations of the full phrase as it previously did. Scholar Paula Blank, in a 2011 article on lesbian etymology, called for taking ownership of lesbian and similar words. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the term dyke was claimed by many lesbians as a term of pride and empowerment. Alison Bechdel, author of comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For (1983‚Äì2008), said use of the term was \\"linguistic activism\\". The strip depicts the lives of a lesbian community and is one of the earliest representations of lesbians in popular culture. It has been described \\"as important to new generations of lesbians as landmark novels like Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973) and Lisa Alther's Kinflicks (1976) were to an earlier one.\\" In her 2011 article The Only Dykey One, Lucy Jones argues that consideration of lesbian culture is core to an understanding of lesbian identity construction. Matters came to a head when the United States Patent and Trademark Office denied the lesbian motorcycle group Dykes on Bikes a trademark for its name, on the grounds dyke was offensive, derogatory and disparaging to lesbians. However, the office reversed itself and permitted the group to register its name after attorneys appealed and submitted hundreds of pages to show the slang word does not disparage lesbians in the way it once did. On December 8, 2005, Dykes on Bikes won the trademark case, and the organization has since gained international recognition for leading San Francisco's gay pride parade. =Facebook controversy= In June 2017, Facebook censored the use of the word \\"dyke\\" on its website as \\"abusive content\\". This decision resulted in a Change.org protest petition created by the Listening 2 Lesbians collective that was signed by 7,247 supporters.Facebook: Stop Discriminating Against Lesbians. Change.org.

Dyke Marches have become popular gay pride events nationwide in the United States and Canada. They are generally non-commercial, in sharp contrast to corporate-sponsored pride events, and some are participated in by bisexual and trans women. The stated mission of the Boston Dyke March, for example, is \\"to provide a dynamic and welcoming space for participants of all sexualities, genders, races, ages, ethnicities, sizes, economic backgrounds, and physical abilities.\\" Marches also take place in several European cities. The United Kingdom's first Dyke March was held in London in 2012. In Germany, the annual Dyke March Berlin was established in 2013. In Mexico, the Marcha L√©sbica (Lesbian March) was founded in March 2003 and is held biannually in Mexico City. Dyke bar A dyke bar is any bar or club frequented by lesbians, and is considered as slang in the vocabulary of the LGBT community.

Serving as the series's central protagonist, he is first introduced as the assistant pig-keeper at Caer Dallben charged with the care of Hen Wen, the oracular white pig. With dreams of becoming a great hero, over the course of the series, his character matures as he is drawn into the war against Arawn Death-Lord and his champion, the Horned King. During his journey, he befriends Princess Eilonwy, a young girl his age, Fflewddur Fflam, a wandering bard and minor king, Gurgi, a wild creature between animal and man, and the dwarf Doli. Upon the conclusion of the series, Taran is crowned High King of Prydain and marries Eilonwy. Appearances in literatureBackground and characteristics= Taran is a young man in late adolescence, who lives with the enchanter Dallben and the aged warrior Coll. He is charged with taking care of the oracular pig Hen Wen and throughout the series is known under the title of Assistant Pig-Keeper. Taran's age is never given at any time in the series, though at the outset he seems to be approximately fourteen years old. The readers are also never given any indication as to the character's appearance, and as a result, he has been depicted in many different ways. In the Disney film The Black Cauldron, he is shown as a red- haired, brown-eyed youth who spends a great deal of time staring out of windows and daydreaming; he is voiced by British actor Grant Bardsley. Taran is headstrong and courageous, though occasionally foolhardy, and harbors an intense desire to prove his worth and heroism through noble acts. Indeed, much of the series centers on Taran's search for his own worth. =The Chronicles of Prydain= Taran was a foundling discovered by Dallben the Enchanter amongst the slaughter on a battlefield. Dallben brought the baby to be raised and educated at the small hamlet of Caer Dallben, where he would be protected by Dallben, the famed enchanter, and Coll, an aged warrior turned farmer. As Taran grew up he became restless and longed for adventures beyond the borders of Caer Dallben. His time would eventually come when, just after being granted the position of Assistant Pig-Keeper to Hen Wen, Dallben's oracular pig (actually a name Coll conceived for the job that had been Taran's for some time), the animal escapes her enclosure. Taran follows her and soon finds himself caught up in an epic struggle that will determine the fate of the land of Prydain. During his adventures he is befriended by the great Prince Gwydion. When the two are captured by the Enchantress Queen Achren, he meets the Princess Eilonwy. With his help, she frees the ancient, magical sword Dyrnwyn from Achren's clutches, an event that will set in motion the war that could bring about the defeat of Arawn, the Death Lord. Taran is assisted in his quest by many friends, including the self-styled Bard Fflewddur Fflam, the shaggy creature Gurgi, and the stalwart dwarf warrior Doli. Taran's adventures see him leading armies against the Death Lord, Arawn, meeting a trio of witches, attempting to rescue the kidnapped Eilonwy and finally struggling to come to terms with his own past. Eventually he proves his worth, both as a soldier and a man, and helps to defeat Arawn in pitched battle. After Arawn is defeated, most of Taran's companions decided to journey to the Summer Country where they will be granted eternal youth and happiness. Taran, however, makes the difficult decision to stay in Prydain and rebuild the land that was nearly destroyed by Arawn. Dalben warns Taran that he is giving up eternal happiness for a difficult life that might end without anyone ever acknowledging his efforts, but Taran remains steadfast in his decision. It is only after this that Dallben and Gwydion reveal to him that he has earned not only his honor, but also the title of High King of Prydain. Taran, it turns out, has fulfilled an old prophecy from The Book of Three which stated that someone of unknown birth would eventually rise up, defeat a serpent (Arawn, Death-Lord of Annuvin implied), choose a kingdom of sorrow over a kingdom of happiness, and thereby prove his worth as the next High King. Taran, the only survivor of a long-past battle, has done just that. With Eilonwy as his Queen, Taran assumes the throne and rules with justice and wisdom until the end of his days. An aspect of all the trials that Taran must overcome in his life until he becomes High King is that he always has to \\"let something go\\". In the first book he must quit his own quest to save Hen Wen so that he can alert the Sons of Don; in the second book he has to let go of a magical brooch that granted him \\"wisdom\\" to have the Black Cauldron, and later he has to let go the honor of capturing the Black Cauldron so that he can transport it to be destroyed. In the third book he must give up Eilonwy, although only temporarily while she is fostered in a foreign royal court, and in the fourth book, he gives up his quest to learn of his parentage. In the last book there is a moment he has to choose between completing his mission and his search for Eilonwy; and there is his momentous decision of giving up eternal life in order to rebuild Prydain. Like many figures in the series, Taran's name is derived from the Mabinogion, where he is named as the father of a man named Glineu. Taran is the Welsh word for thunder, and may be related to the Gaulish god Taranis.

He was named after his Grandmother, Mary Ann Stirling, whose family occupied the Stirling Castle in Scotland for 400 years. She married William Kirk Fowler of Auchtermuchty, County Fife and they emigrated to the US in 1852. Fowler spent his virtually his entire editing career at Twentieth Century-Fox. After spending years helping other film editors, including Louis Loeffler, Barbara McLean, William H. Reynolds and Robert Simpson, Fowler was promoted to film editor full-time in 1952; his first movie as a film editor was Phone Call from a Stranger, released that year and directed by Jean Negulesco. Although he edited only 38 movies in a 20-year career, all of them Twentieth releases, he edited some of the greatest scenes in the studio's history. Two of them involved the same actress, Marilyn Monroe: her performance of the song \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\" from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (directed by Howard Hawks - 1953) and her blown-skirt scene in The Seven Year Itch (directed by Billy Wilder-1955). It was not until eight years after Monroe's death that Fowler won his Oscar, for the movie Patton (1970). His final movie, The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972), was directed by John Huston. Fowler died in California three years later. Fowler is remembered for editing primarily Twentieth theatrical releases directed by freelancers, including Howard Hawks (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), Franklin J.

Funk & Wagnalls continued to publish revised editions for several years independently of Encarta, but ceased printing in the late 1990s. =Launch= The name Encarta was created for Microsoft by an advertising agency.Harvard Business School Case Study 'Blown to Bits' It launched in 1993 as a $395 product,\\"Coming Attractions: Encyclopedias\\", 22 Dec 1992, PC Mag although it soon dropped to $99, and was often bundled into the price of a new computer purchase.\\"Encyclopedic Knowledge, Then vs. Now\\", Randall Stross, May 2, 2009, New York TimesTom Corddry: \\"Encarta was not given away but sold at retail for about $100, and sold wholesale to PC manufacturers who bundled it with new machines.\\" In the late 1990s, Microsoft added content from Collier's Encyclopedia and New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia from Macmillan into Encarta after purchasing them. Thus the final Microsoft Encarta can be considered the successor of the Funk and Wagnalls, Collier, and New Merit Scholar encyclopedias. None of these formerly successful encyclopedias remained in print for long after being merged into Encarta. Microsoft introduced several regional versions of Encarta translated into languages other than English. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese version was introduced in 1999 and suspended in 2002. The Spanish version was somewhat smaller than the English one, at 42,000 articles. =Move to the web and demise= In 2000, the full Encarta content became available on the World Wide Web to subscribers, with a subset available for free to anyone. In 2006, Websters Multimedia, a Bellevue, Washington subsidiary of London-based Websters International Publishers, took over maintenance of Encarta from Microsoft. The last version was Encarta Premium 2009, released in August 2008. Microsoft announced in April 2009 that it would cease to sell Microsoft Student and all editions of Encarta Premium software products worldwide by June 2009, citing changes in the way people seek information, and in the traditional encyclopedia and reference material market, as the key reasons behind the termination. Updates for Encarta were offered until October 2009. Additionally, MSN Encarta web sites were discontinued around October 31, 2009, with the exception of Encarta Japan which was discontinued on December 31, 2009. Existing MSN Encarta Premium (part of MSN Premium) subscribers were refunded. The demise of Encarta was widely attributed to competition from the free and user-generated wikipedia, which grew to be larger than Encarta from its early beginnings in 2001Noam Cohen. \\"Microsoft Encarta Dies After Long Battle With wikipedia\\" New York Times thanks to popularization by web search services like Google. At the time of its closure in 2009, Encarta had about 62,000 articles, most behind a paywall, while the English-language wikipedia had over 2.8 million articles in open access. Contents and features Encartas standard edition included approximately 50,000 articles, with additional images, videos and sounds. The premium editions contained over 62,000 articles and other multimedia content, such as 25,000 pictures and illustrations, over 300 videos and animations, and an interactive atlas with 1.8 million locations. Its articles were integrated with multimedia content and could include links to websites selected by its editors. Encartas articles in general were less lengthy and more summarized than the printed version of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica or the online wikipedia. Like most multimedia encyclopedias, Encartas articles tended to provide an overview of the subject rather than an exhaustive coverage and can only be viewed one at a time. A sidebar could display alternative views, essays, journals or original materials relevant to the topic. For example, when reading about computers, it featured annals since 1967 of the computer industry. Encarta also supported closed captioning for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called Encarta Research Organizer was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word document-based report. Later versions included Encarta Researcher, a browser plugin to organize information from Encarta articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from Encarta was appended with a copyright boilerplate message after the selection. The user interface allowed for viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactives. Encarta was originally available for sale on 1 to 5 CD-ROMs or a DVD. Some new PCs were shipped with an OEM edition of Encarta. Encarta 2000 and later had \\"Map Treks\\", which were tours of geographic features and concepts. Microsoft had a separate product known as Encarta Africana which was an encyclopedia of black history and culture. It was integrated into the standard Encarta Reference suite starting with the 2001 version. Encarta 2002 and onward feature 3D Virtual Tours of ancient structures, for example the Acropolis; 2D panoramic images of world wonders or major cities; and a virtual flight feature which allows users to fly a virtual airplane over a coarsely generated artificial landscape area. Version 2002 also introduced the ability to install the entire encyclopedia locally to the hard disk drive to prevent frequent swapping of discs. Encarta 2003 incorporated literature guides and book summaries, foreign language translation dictionaries, a Homework Center and Chart Maker. Encartas Visual Browser, available since the 2004 version, presented a user with a list of related topics making them more discoverable. A collection of 32 Discovery Channel videos were also later added. Encarta 2005 introduced another program called Encarta Kids aimed at children to make learning fun. Encarta also included a trivia game called \\"MindMaze\\" (accessible through Ctrl+Z) in which the player explores a castle by answering questions whose answers can be found in the encyclopedia's articles. There was also a \\"Geography Quiz\\" and several other games and quizzes, some quizzes also in Encarta Kids. For years, Encarta came in three primary software editions: Standard, Premium, and Reference Library (price and features in that order). Beginning with Encarta 2006, however, when Websters Multimedia took over its maintenance, Encarta became a feature of Microsoft Student. Although it was possible to purchase only the Encarta encyclopedia separately, Microsoft Student bundles together Encarta Premium with Microsoft Math (a graphing-calculator program) and Learning Essentials, which provides templates for Microsoft Office. In addition, the Reference Library was discontinued, absorbed into a newer, more comprehensive Premium package. Encartas user interface was shared with Microsoft Student, and was streamlined to reduce clutter with only a Search box which returned relevant results; however it became no longer possible to simply browse all the encyclopedia articles alphabetically. =World Atlas= The dynamic maps were generated with the same engine that powered Microsoft MapPoint software. The map was a virtual globe that one could freely rotate and magnify to any location down to major streets for big cities. The globe had multiple surfaces displaying political boundaries, physical landmarks, historical maps and statistical information. One could selectively display statistical values on the globe surface or in a tabular form, different sized cities, various geological or man-made features and reference lines in a map. The maps contained hyperlinks to related articles (\\"Map Trek\\") and also supported a \\"Dynamic Sensor\\" that provides the latitude, longitude, place name, population and local time for any point on the globe. Encarta also generated a visible- light moon atlas with names of major craters and hyperlinks. However, it did not include a planetarium, but instead had a small interactive constellation- only map. In addition to database generated maps, many other illustrative maps in Encarta (\\"Historical Maps\\") were drawn by artists. Some more advanced maps were interactive: for example, the large African map for Africana could display information such as political boundaries or the distribution of African flora. =Encarta Dictionary= When Encarta was released as part of the \\"Reference Suite\\" in 1998 to 2000, Microsoft bundled \\"Microsoft Bookshelf\\" with the other programs (Encarta Encyclopedia 98 Deluxe Edition, Encarta Desk Atlas, Encarta Virtual Globe 98, Encarta World English Dictionary, and Encarta Research Organizer). \\"Bookshelf\\" was discontinued in 2000, and in later Encarta editions (Encarta Suite 2000 and onward), \\"Bookshelf\\" was replaced with a dedicated Encarta Dictionary, a superset of its printed version, The Encarta World English Dictionary (later Encarta Webster's Dictionary). There was some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in \\"Bookshelf\\" which many found to be a useful reference, such as Columbia Dictionary of Quotations (replaced with a quotations section in Encarta that links to relevant articles and people) and an Internet Directory (although many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist). Print versions of Encarta dictionaries have also been published, including: *Encarta World English Dictionary (St Martin's Press, /) *Bloomsbury English Dictionary :*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, /)Bloomsbury English Dictionary *Microsoft Encarta Dictionary: The first dictionary for the Internet age (St. Martin's Paperbacks, /) *Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary: The First Dictionary For The Internet Age (St. Martin's Press, /) *Encarta Webster's College Dictionary of the English Language :*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, /)Encarta Webster's Dictionary of the English Language *Encarta Webster's College Dictionary :*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, /)Encarta Webster's College Dictionary =Regional versions= Robert McHenry, while Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, criticized Encarta for differences in factual content between national versions of Encarta, accusing Microsoft of \\"pandering to local prejudices\\" instead of presenting subjects objectively., essay by Robert McHenry An article written by Bill Gates addressed the nature of writing encyclopedias for different regions. Technology Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007 running on Windows XP. Before the emergence of the World Wide Web for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a multimedia markup language, full text search, and extensibility using software objects. The hypertext display, hyperlinking and search software was created by a team of CD-ROM Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as interactive help, document management systems and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia. Encarta was able to use various Microsoft technologies because it was extensible with software components for displaying unique types of multimedia information. For example, a snap in map engine is adapted from its MapPoint software. The hypertext and search engine used by Encarta also powered Microsoft Bookshelf. Encarta used database technologies to generate much of its multimedia content. For example, Encarta generated each zoomable map from a global geographic information system database on demand. When a user used the copy and paste function of Microsoft Windows on Encarta on more than five words, Encarta automatically appended a copyright boilerplate message after the paste. =User editing= Early in 2005, Gary Alt announced that the online Encarta started to allow users to suggest changes to existing articles.\\"Encarta Encyclopedia Test Edit System\\", 15 April 2005, Associated Press Encartas content was accessible using a conversational interface on Windows Live Messenger via the MSN Bot \\"Encarta Instant Answers\\".MSN screenname: encarta@conversagent.com and encarta@botmetro.net The bot could answer many encyclopedia related questions directly in the IM window. It used short sentences from the Encarta website, and sometimes displays full articles in the Internet Explorer-based browser on the right. It also could complete simple mathematical and advanced algebra problems.

However, despite the inclusion of news-related and some supplementary articles, Encartas contents had not been changed substantially in its later years. Besides the yearly update, the installed offline copy could be updated over the Internet for a certain period for free depending on the edition. Some articles (usually about 2,000) were updated to reflect important changes or events. When the update period expired, an advertisement prompting to upgrade to the new version was displayed to the user occasionally. Reception The editors of PC Gamer US nominated Microsoft Encarta '95 for their 1994 \\"Best Educational Product\\" award, although it lost to the CD-ROM adaptation of The Way Things Work.

As the eldest son of Casimir IV Jagiellon, he was expected to inherit Poland and Lithuania. George of Podƒõbrady, the Hussite ruler of Bohemia, offered to make Vladislaus his heir in 1468. Podƒõbrady needed Casimir IV's support against the rebellious Catholic noblemen and their ally, Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. The Diet of Bohemia elected Vladislaus king after Podƒõbrady's death, but he could only rule Bohemia proper, because Matthias (whom the Catholic nobles had elected king) occupied Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia. Vladislaus tried to reconquer the four provinces with his father's assistance, but Matthias repelled them. Vladislaus and Matthias divided the Crown of Bohemia in the Peace of Olomouc in 1479. The Estates of the realm had strengthened their position during the war between the two kings. Vladislaus's attempts to promote the Catholics caused a rebellion in Prague and other towns in 1483, forcing him to acknowledge the dominance of the Hussites in the municipal assemblies. The Diet confirmed the right of the Bohemian noblemen and commoners to freely adhere either to Hussitism or Catholicism in 1485. After Matthias Corvinus seized Silesian duchies to grant them to his illegitimate son, John Corvinus, Vladislaus made new alliances against him in the late 1480s. Vladislaus (whose mother, Elizabeth of Habsburg, was the sister of Matthias's predecessor) laid claim to Hungary after Matthias's death. The Diet of Hungary elected him king after his supporters defeated John Corvinus. The other two claimants, Maximilian of Habsburg and Vladislaus's brother, John Albert, invaded Hungary, but they could not assert their claim and made peace with Vladislaus in 1491. He settled in Buda, enabling the Estates of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and both Lusatias to take full charge of state administration. In Hungary, Vladislaus always approved the decisions of the Royal Council, hence his nickname \\"Dobzse L√°szl√≥\\" (from Latin rex Bene, in Czech kr√°l Dob≈ôe, in Polish kr√≥l Dobrze, or \\"King Very Well\\"). Due to the concessions he had made before his election, the royal treasury could not finance a standing army and Matthias Corvinus's Black Army was dissolved after a rebellion, although the Ottomans made regular raids against the southern border. They even annexed territories in Croatia after annihilating the united army of the Croatian barons in the Battle of Krbava Field in 1493. Early life Vladislaus was the eldest son of Casimir IV, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Elizabeth of Habsburg. She was the daughter of Albert, King of the Romans, Hungary and Bohemia, and Elizabeth of Luxembourg, the only child and sole heiress of the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Vladislaus was born in Krak√≥w on 1 March 1456. His mother and father laid claim to Hungary and Bohemia after her childless brother, Ladislaus the Posthumous, died on 23 November 1457. However, their claims were ignored in both Hungary and Bohemia. The Diet of Hungary elected Matthias Corvinus king on 24 January 1458. The Bohemian Estates of the realm proclaimed the Hussite George of Podƒõbrady king on 2 March. Vladislaus was his father's heir in Poland and Lithuania. Casimir IV wanted to prepare all his sons for ruling a realm and tasked renowned scholars with their education. The historian Jan D≈Çugosz was Vladislaus's tutor. Pope Paul II excommunicated George of Podƒõbrady in late 1466 and proclaimed a crusade against him. The Czech Catholic noblemen rose up against the \\"heretic\\" George of Podƒõbrady and sought assistance from Matthias Corvinus. Matthias declared war in March 1468 and invaded Moravia. On 16 May 1468, George of Podƒõbrady offered Casimir IV to make Vladislaus his heir if Casimir mediated a peace treaty between Bohemia and Hungary. Matthias refused Casimir's offer, but George of Podƒõbrady forced him to sign a truce in early 1469. Fearing of losing Matthias's support, the Catholic nobles proclaimed him king of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May. After George of Podƒõbrady repeated his offer of bequeathing Bohemia to Vladislaus, Casimir IV entered into negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick III on George of Podƒõbrady's behalf. George of Podƒõbrady died on 22 March 1471. Reign Arch-Cupbearer of the Empire\\" on fol. 33r of Portuguese armorial Livro do Armeiro-Mor (1509) =War for Bohemia= After the fifteen-year-old Vladislaus pledged to respect the liberties of the Estates of the realm, the Bohemian Diet elected him king at Kutn√° Hora on 27 May 1471. He was specifically required to acknowledge the existence of two \\"nations\\" (the Catholic and Hussite Estates) in his realm in accordance with the Compacts of Basel, although the Holy See had already condemned the Compacts in 1462. The Holy See regarded Vladislaus's election invalid and the papal legate, Lorenzo Roverella, confirmed Matthias Corvinus's claim to Bohemia on 28 May. However, Emperor Frederick III refused to acknowledge Matthias as the lawful king of Bohemia. Vladislaus was crowned king in Prague on 22 August 1471. He could only secure his position with the noblemen's support, because no army had accompanied him to Bohemia. Consequently, the Diet developed into the most influential body of state administration during his reign. The Diet started to work as a legislative assembly and passed decrees that were recorded in specific registers. Casimir IV also supported Vladislaus. He allowed his second son, Vladislaus's brother Casimir, to invade Upper Hungary (now Slovakia) from Poland after a group of Hungarian barons and prelates offered Casimir the Hungarian throne in late 1471. Matthias defeated Casimir and forced him to withdraw from Hungary before the end of the year. On 1 March 1472, Pope Sixtus IV authorized his legate, Marco Barbo, to excommunicate Vladislaus and his father if they continued to wage war against Matthias. The first truce between Vladislaus and Matthias was signed on 31 May. Their representatives continued negotiations for months, often in the presence of the papal legate who supported Matthias's claims. The Diet elected four noblemen at Bene≈°ov in 1473 to administer Bohemia as regents until peace was restored. The representatives of Casimir IV and Matthias concluded a peace treaty on 21 February 1474. Two days later Vladislaus also agreed to sign a truce for three years. Before long, Vladislaus met Frederick III at the Imperial Diet in Nuremberg and persuaded him to make an alliance against Matthias. Casimir IV also joined the coalition. The Polish and Bohemian armies broke into Silesia and besieged Matthias in Wroc≈Çaw in October. The Hungarian troops cut off the invaders' supply routes, forcing Vladislaus and Casimir to sign a new truce for more than one year on 8 December. The young Barbara of Brandenburg inherited the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w in Silesia from her husband, Henry XI of G≈Çog√≥w, in 1476. Most Silesian dukes had years before acknowledged the suzerainty of Matthias Corvinus, but Vladislaus wanted to expand his authority in the province. He married Barbara by proxy to seize her duchy. With Matthias's support, Henry XI's nephew, Jan II, Duke of ≈ªaga≈Ñ, broke into the duchy and occupied it. After Barbara lost her dowry, the Royal Council forbade her to come to Bohemia. Vladislaus's attempt to seize G≈Çog√≥w gave rise to a new conflict. Vladislaus and Frederick III confirmed their alliance against Matthias on 5 December 1476. The papal legate, Baldasare de Piscia, threatened Vladislaus with excommunication if he invaded Matthias's realms. Frederick III installed Vladislaus as king of Bohemia and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire on 10 June 1477. Two days later, Matthias declared war against the emperor and invaded Austria. Vladislaus sent reinforcements to his ally, but he withdrew his troops from Austria before the end of July. Frederick was forced to acknowledge Matthias as the lawful king of Bohemia on 1 December. Baldasare de Piscia excommunicated Vladislaus and his supporters on 15 January 1478. The representatives of Vladislaus and Matthias started new negotiations, and they reached a compromise that was accepted by both monarchs. The right of both Vladislaus and Matthias to use the title of king of Bohemia was confirmed, but only Matthias was required to address Vladislaus as such in their correspondence. The Lands of the Bohemian Crown were divided: Vladislaus ruled in Bohemia proper and Matthias in Moravia, Silesia, Upper and Lower Lusatias. The compromise also authorized Vladislaus to redeem the three provinces for 400,000 gold florins after Matthias's death. Matthias and Vladislaus ratified the peace treaty with great pomp and ceremony at a meeting in Olomouc on 21 July 1479. =Conflicts in Bohemia= The Peace of Olomouc enabled the Catholic noblemen who had supported Matthias to return to Bohemia. Vladislaus, who remained a Catholic, decided to strengthen the position of the Catholics in his realm because he needed the support of the Holy See to strengthen his position in Europe. Although he was unable to achieve the restoration of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague, he began replacing the Hussite members of the town councils with Catholic burghers. Two sons of Vladislaus's predecessor, Jind≈ôich and Hynek of Podƒõbrady, also converted to Catholicism. Vladislav Hall within the Prague Castle Vladislaus's campaign for re-Catholization stirred up the Hussites, and the townspeople in Prague rose up in September 1483. The rebels murdered or expelled all Catholic clerics and aldermen and persecuted the Germans and Jews. Vladislaus was also forced to leave the capital. Similar rebellions broke out in Nymburk, ≈Ωatec and Hradec Kr√°lov√©. After realizing that he could not send forces against Prague, Vladislaus acknowledged that he was unable to continue his pro-Catholic policy and confirmed the new Hussite aldermen in 1484. Vladislaus had a close relathship with the Jewish community, even employing jews like Abraham of Bohemia. The success of the revolt of the burghers of Prague brought about a between the moderate Hussite and Catholic noblemen who treated the townspeople with disdain. Vladislaus also urged the noblemen to reach an agreement on religious matters. Their compromise was confirmed at the Diet in Kutn√° Hora in March 1485, with acknowledging the right of both noblemen and commoners to freely adhere either to Catholicism or to Utraquism during the following 31 years. Frederick III failed to invite Vladislaus and Matthias to the Imperial Diet at Frankfurt, where his son, Maximilian, was elected King of the Romans on 16 February 1486. Frederick's omission offended both kings of Bohemia who made an alliance against the emperor at a meeting in Jihlava on 11 September. The meeting also created an opportunity to discuss other issues of common interest, especially the circulation of money in their realms. Vladislaus pledged to send reinforcements to Matthias to fight against Frederick III, but his advisors convinced him not to keep his promise. The Diet of Bohemia also urged him to make peace with the emperor and the prince-electors in June 1487. In the same year, Pope Innocent VIII lifted the excommunication and recognized Vladislaus as king of Bohemia. Matthias Corvinus confiscated large estates in his realms and granted them to his illegitimate son, John Corvinus, because he wanted to make John his heir. The sons of George of Podƒõbrady were among the barons who lost their estates to John Corvinus, which annoyed Vladislaus because some estates were located in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Vladislaus sought his father's assistance, and they made a formal alliance against Matthias on 23 April. Matthias forced Jan II of ≈ªaga≈Ñ to renounce G≈Çog√≥w in favor of John Corvinus in spring 1489. Before long, Vladislaus made peace with Emperor Frederick, but the emperor's son, Maximilian, started peace negotiations with Matthias. =War for Hungary= Succession wars in Hungary after the death of Matthias Corvinus (Vladislas marked dark red) Matthias Corvinus died unexpectedly in Vienna on 6 April 1490. By the time the noblemen assembled to elect his successor in May, four candidates laid claim to the throne. John Corvinus was primarily supported by barons and prelates who owned estates along the southern frontier (including Lawrence √öjlaki and Peter V√°radi, Archbishop of Kalocsa). Maximilian of Habsburg referred to the 1463 Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt, which prescribed that Emperor Frederick or his heirs were to inherit Hungary if Matthias died without a legitimate heir. Vladislaus claimed Hungary as the eldest son of the sister of Matthias's predecessor, Ladislaus the Posthumous. However, his parents, who wanted to secure a separate realm to their each sons, proposed Vladislaus's younger brother, John Albert. Most Hungarian barons and prelates preferred Vladislaus, because his rule in Bohemia had indicated that he would respect their liberties. Vladislaus also pledged that he would marry Matthias's wealthy widow, Beatrice of Naples, after his coronation. His two supporters, Stephen B√°thory and Paul Kinizsi, defeated John Corvinus on 4 July. The Diet of Hungary elected Vladislaus king on 15 July. Vladislaus who had left Prague for Hungary in late June issued a charter promising to refrain from imposing extraordinary taxes or introducing other \\"harmful novelties\\" and to closely cooperate with the Royal Council. He reached Buda (the capital of Hungary) on 9 August. He met his brother, who had marched as far as Pest on the opposite side of the Danube River, but they did not reach a compromise. Vladislaus was crowned king on 18 September in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. In accordance with the promise he made after his election, he settled in Buda. In his absence, Bohemia was administered by the great officers of state, especially the Burgrave of Prague and the Chancellor. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia had acknowledged his rule soon after Matthias Corvinus's death. Although Vladislaus pledged that the three provinces would be attached to the Hungarian Crown until the money stipulated in the Peace of Olomouc was paid to the Hungarian treasury, the Estates of the Bohemian Crown argued that the personal union under his rule made that stipulation void. The 400,000 gold florins were never paid. John Albert did not renounce Hungary after Vladislaus's coronation. He captured Eger and laid siege to Kassa (Ko≈°ice in Slovakia) in September. Vladislaus married Beatrice of Naples in Esztergom on 4 October, but the marriage was kept secret, although she gave considerable funds to him to finance his campaigns for Hungary. Maximilian of Habsburg also invaded Hungary and seized Szombathely, Veszpr√©m and Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r by the end of November. Vladislaus's supporters relieved Kassa in early December, and Maximilian withdrew from Hungary before the end of the year, because he could not finance his campaign. John Albert renounced his claim to Hungary in exchange for the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w and the suzerainty over half of Silesia on 20 February 1491. John Albert again broke into Hungary in autumn, but Stephen Z√°polya forced him to withdraw. Vladislaus's troops had meanwhile expelled the army of Maximilian of Habsburg from Hungary. In the Peace of Pressburg, signed on 7 November, Vladislaus renounced all territories that Matthias Corvinus had conquered in Austria and also acknowledged the Habsburgs' right to inherit Hungary and Bohemia if he died without a son. Stephen Z√°polya routed John Albert at Eperjes (Pre≈°ov in Slovakia) on 24 December, forcing him to abandon his claim to Hungary. =New regime in Hungary= Although John Filipec, Bishop of V√°rad, warned Vladislaus that the Hungarians could only be \\"forced to obedience with a rod of iron\\", Vladislaus did not continue Matthias Corvinus's centralizing policies. Almost all important decisions were made collectively in the Royal Council and Vladislaus always accepted them, saying Dobrze (\\"Very well\\" in Polish), which is the origin of his nickname. Thomas Bak√≥cz and Stephen Z√°polya were his most influential advisors in the 1490s. The Diet of Hungary which had been convoked only five times during the last thirteen years of Matthias Corvinus's rule regained its importance. The first Diet assembled in early 1492. It only ratified the Peace of Pressburg after most noblemen who had attained the first sessions returned home, because they accused the authors of the treaty of treachery for renouncing Matthias's conquests. Casimir IV died on 7 June 1492 after bequeathing Poland and Lithuania to Vladislaus's younger brothers, John Albert and Alexander, respectively. Vladislaus laid claim to Poland, but the Polish noblemen elected John Albert king on 27 August. Vladislaus had inherited an almost empty treasury from Matthias and he was unable to raise money to finance his predecessor's Black Army (a standing army of mercenaries). The unpaid mercenaries rose up and pillaged several villages along the Sava River. Paul Kinizsi routed them in September. Most mercenaries were executed and Vladislaus dissolved the remnants of the army on 3 January 1493. The Ottomans began to make regular raids against Hungary along the southern border. An Ottoman army inflicted a crushing defeat on the united army of the leading Croatian barons in the Battle of Krbava Field on 11 September 1493. The Ottomans annexed the Adriatic coast to the north of the river Neretva as far as Omi≈°. A few months later, the Croatian noblemen assembled at Bihaƒá and tried to seek assistance from Pope Alexander VI and Maximilian of Habsburg. Nevertheless, Vladislaus was still regarded as the head of a powerful state, especially because he and his two brothers ruled the most powerful states in Central Europe. They met in L≈ëcse (Levoƒça in Slovakia) in April 1494 to achieve a common foreign policy, but Vladislaus and John Albert did not reach a compromise about Moldavia and Silesia. Vladislaus levied an extraordinary tax, or \\"subsidy\\", without the authorization of the Diet in spring 1494. The noblemen protested against the tax all over the kingdom. Lawrence √öjlaki, who was one of the wealthiest barons in Hungary, ordered the murder of a tax-collector and called Vladislaus an ox. Vladislaus accused √öjlaki of co-operation with the Ottomans and launched a military campaign against him, compelling him to beg for mercy in early 1495. √öjlaki was allowed to retain his most estates. The representatives of Vladislaus and the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II signed a truce for three years in April 1495, but Ottoman raids across the borders continued in Croatia. The Estates accused Vladislaus's treasurer, Sigismund Ernuszt, of embezzlement at the Diet in May 1496. At the Diet's demand, Vladislaus ordered the arrest of Ernuszt and his deputy. Ernuszt was released only after paying a ransom of 400,000 gold florins. Vladislaus visited Bohemia in the first half of 1497. After his return, the Diet persuaded him to forbid the unpopular Tam√°s Bak√≥cz to use the royal seals, but Bak√≥cz remained the arch-chancellor. The royal seals were entrusted to George Szatm√°ri, who was the Thurz√≥s' close ally. Pope Alexander made Bak√≥cz Archbishop of Esztergom on 20 December. =Ottoman threat= Vladislaus rewarded the Estates of Slavonia (the \\"shield of Hungary\\" against the Ottomans) with a separate coat-of-arms at the end of 1497. The truce with the Ottoman Empire came to an end in 1498. The 1498 Diet of Hungary sanctioned the introduction of a one-florin ordinary tax, stipulating that the landowners could retain half of the tax to pay their own retainers. A decree obliged the wealthiest barons and prelates to set up their own armies. Another decree prescribed that the Royal Council could only make decisions if at least eight elected noble jurors of the royal courts attained the meeting. The Diet also passed laws that increased the noblemen's income at the expense of Church revenues and limited the economic privileges of the towns and townspeople. Vladislaus made an alliance with John Albert and Stephen III of Moldavia against the Ottomans in Krak√≥w on 20 July 1498. He was also reconciled with John Corvinus and made him ban of Croatia, tasking him with the defense of Croatia. During his reign (1490‚Äì1516), the Hungarian royal power declined in favour of the Hungarian magnates, who used their power to curtail the peasants‚Äô freedom.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/170596/Dozsa- Rebellion His reign in Hungary was largely stable, although Hungary was under consistent border pressure from the Ottoman Empire and went through the revolt of Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa. On March 11, 1500, the Bohemian Diet adopted a new land constitution that limited royal power, and Vladislav signed it in 1502 (hence it is known as Vladislav land order). Additionally, he oversaw the construction (1493‚Äì1502) of the enormous Vladislav Hall atop the palace at the Prague Castle. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, two weeks after his 60th birthday, in the city of Buda. His funeral was held six days later in the main cathedral of the city of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, where all the Kings of Hungary used to be buried. His son was previously crowned as King of Hungary in 1508 and in 1509 as King of Bohemia before his father died, so the succession was assured. Before he died, Vladislaus called Tam√°s Bak√≥cz, John Bornemissza, and George Hohenzollern, and named them the bearers and custodians of the young prince Louis. The monarch left a Kingdom in political ruins with a debt of 403,000 Hungarian florins. Family Vladislaus II was married three times, the first time in 1476 at Frankfurt/Oder to Barbara of Brandenburg, daughter of Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg, child widow of Silesian Piast Henry XI of G≈Çog√≥w. His second wife was Beatrice of Naples, the widow of King Matthias, who was a daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples. His third wife, Anne of Foix- Candale, was crowned on 29 September 1502 when she was about 18 years old and he was 46. She gave birth to his only two surviving legitimate children, Anne of Bohemia and Hungary and Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia, and died in 1506 from complications resulting from the birth of Louis. After his death, Vladislaus' ten-year-old son Louis succeeded him on the thrones of both Bohemia and Hungary. His daughter Anna was married in 1515 to the future emperor Ferdinand of Austria, a grandson of Emperor Maximilian I. Therefore, after the death of Louis at the Battle of Moh√°cs, the succession devolved through Anna to the cadet line of eastern Habsburgs.

The episode was written by Timothy Schlattmann and was directed by Tony Goldwyn. In the episode, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) investigates a murder scene where one of his own victims has returned after he disposed of the body. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) tries to prevent her husband Paul from attending their daughter's birthday party, and Lt. Mar√≠a LaGuerta (Lauren V√©lez) considers adopting a young witness of the murder whom she finds at the crime scene. Though set in Miami, Florida, the episode was filmed at various locations in and around Los Angeles, California including a salvage yard, a field by Tujunga Wash and a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island. Goldwyn, who Erik King said was \\"a joy to work with\\", allowed actor C.S. Lee to improvise and David Zayas to memorize his Spanish lines in English and translate them mentally during each take. \\"Return to Sender\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot While eating breakfast with Rita, Dexter is called to a crime scene, only to discover that it is the salvage yard where he committed a double murder the previous night. He finds Valerie Castillo's body lying in the Airstream trailer where he killed her and her husband Jorge, despite having thrown the corpses into the ocean. He deduces that the Ice Truck Killer retrieved and planted the body. LaGuerta, Doakes, and Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) discover a young Cuban boy, Oscar (Cesar Flores), who claims to have seen somebody take Valerie into the trailer. Dexter begins to fear discovery, and has a nightmare of Debra being a serial killer with a modus operandi to his own. As the investigation proceeds, Dexter attempts to discredit each of his colleagues' leads on the case. When Debra asks him to read her report on the killer, profiling a man sharing many of Dexter's characteristics, he second-guesses her theory. Worried about coming under suspicion, he throws his knives into the ocean. However, while looking at the blood drops from his victims, he notices that Valerie's slide has a happy face etched into her sample. Dexter realizes that this is a hint from the Ice Truck Killer, leading him to go to the salvage yard and plant Jorge's fingerprints and a knife bearing a dry drop of Valerie's blood for Doakes' men to find. After successfully framing Jorge for Valerie's murder, Dexter discovers that Oscar's description of the man who \\"saved\\" him from Valerie is in fact Jesus Christ. Meanwhile, Rita learns that her abusive husband Paul is released from prison, and she forbids him from attending their daughter Astor's birthday party. Doakes takes Debra to dinner with his mother (Vernee Watson-Johnson) and sisters, while LaGuerta bonds with Oscar and considers adopting him until his uncle (Gabriel Salvador) arrives to take him home. In flashbacks, a teenaged Debra (Haley King) pleads with her father Harry to bring her on his and Dexter's (Devon Graye) hunting trips. When Harry forbids her from joining them, she steals his gun and practices shooting cans by herself. Later, Debra lashes out at Dexter in jealousy of the time that he spends alone with their father. Production The salvage yard's Airstream trailer was shot both on location and on a sound stage. The day of filming in the salvage yard, which took place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was abnormally hot according to Lauren V√©lez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid‚Äî\\"all the things we needed it to be\\". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and a house in a residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home. King said that Tony Goldwyn was \\"a joy to work with\\", while V√©lez called him \\"an absolute actors' director\\". Shooting a scene in which Det. Angel Batista converses with a witness entirely in Spanish, David Zayas did not feel confident to memorize all of his Spanish lines. Instead, he learned his lines in English and translated the dialogue mentally during each take. In a scene between Dexter and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee), Masuka pauses after examining a corpse and says, \\"I'm hungry.\\" Michael C. Hall said that \\"C.S. [Lee's] ad libs are different every time. When he said, 'I'm hungry,' that was the only take that I didn't laugh.\\" When asked about improvising on the show, Lee said that the writers \\"come up with some good lines themselves. [...] So I pretty much leave it up to them.\\" Reception \\"Return to Sender\\" was generally praised by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that the episode's \\"most interesting facet\\" was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though he felt that the young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was \\"a slightly cheesy moment\\". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar \\"was okay, but [the storyline] fell a little flat\\". TV Guides Paula Paige \\"love[d]\\" the episode, saying that \\"It just keeps getting better and better\\", but was unsure \\"what Deb having dinner with the Doakes' family has to do with anything\\". Writing for TV Squad, Jonathan Toomey opened his review of \\"Return to Sender\\" by saying, \\"Dexter did it again. Wowed me. Amazed me. Edge of my seat for the whole hour.\\" He was amused that Debra's profile of Valerie's murderer matched Dexter, but was uninterested in Rita's storyline with her husband. Both Malene Arpe of the Toronto Star and Daniel Fienberg of Zap2it were disappointed with the episode's audio commentary featuring Jennifer Carpenter, Erik King, Lauren V√©lez and David Zayas on the first season DVD.

Situated 300 kilometers south of Tunis and 32 kilometers south of Sfax, Mahres is part of the Sfax Governorate. Mahres's population increases drastically during its summer months when a large portion of its diaspora returns from Western European countries and from other regions of Tunisia to spend the summer in Mahres. History The town enjoys a strategic location that placed it on two important Roman roads that notably linked Carthage to Alexandria. The Byzantine fortress of Younga, the only archaeological site of its kind in the region, remains a testimony to the historical importance of Mahres. Taking its name from its protective function extending from Antiquity to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, Mahres was a key component of the Phoenician empire in Tunisia as a commercial coastal trading post, which helped facilitate the conversion of the Berbers to Christianity during the Roman and Byzantine periods. During the Aghlabid period, in which the Arab Muslim presence became dominant, Mahres was a powerful bulwark against foreign invasions. Economy The town thrives on the cultivation of olive trees, the extraction of olive oil, fishing, the agro-food industry, the furniture industry and the manufacturing of clothing. One of the largest olive groves in Tunisia is located within the Mahres delegation. Moreover, the fishing port, inaugurated by the former president Habib Bourguiba on April 21, 1987, constitutes a place of recreation for the inhabitants of the city in addition to its economic aspect. Meanwhile, the gas plant SIAP, located 9 kilometers north of the town, is operated by the British group British Gas and supplies 50% of Tunisia's natural gas needs. Mahres is known in the region for its long beach called Chaffar, a notable beach area and tourist attraction within the governorate of Sfax. Chaffar is located three kilometers north of Mahres, and is frequently visited by residents of Mahres and Sfax. Mahres has two hotels - Hotel Tamaris and Hotel Marzouk. Culture Mahres has hosted the International Festival of Plastic Arts every summer since its establishment in 1988, which is attended by numerous painters and sculptures from around the world. The artists come to Mahres to create art that is then permanently displayed in the town's corniche. Education Mahres has two high schools, two middle schools, eleven elementary schools and a vocational training center. Since 1968, a team of researchers from the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich, led by Professor R√ºdiger Wehner, spend several months in Mahres during the summer studying the mode of navigation of the Sahara Desert Ant. Sport Mahres has a municipal stadium that seats approximately 1,000 spectators. The stadium hosts the matches of the town's football club, Association Sportive de Mahres (ASM). The team's biggest football achievement has been reaching the knockout stages of the Tunisian Cup in 2004. In addition, the town houses a youth center for entertainment and the practice of various artistic and sporting activities. Health The town has a regional hospital, four pharmacies, a medical imaging center, a private laboratory for biological analysis, eight private physician's offices, five dental offices, a gynecology clinic, an ophthalmology clinic, a cardiology clinic, and an orthopedic surgery office. Infrastructure Mahres is intersected by a set of railway tracks connecting Tunis to Gabes and Gabes to Gafsa. These tracks were established in 1898 during the time of the French Protectorate of Tunisia. The Route Nationale 1 (RN1), Tunisia's 580 kilometer long national highway that connects Tunisia's capital of Tunis to Tunisia's southern border with Libya, also runs through Mahres.

An example is osteitis fibrosa cystica. Mechanism The thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary, or adrenal glands, and the pancreas are parts of the endocrine system, and, therefore are associated with the endocrine bone disease. Some common endocrine disorders are hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Paget‚Äôs disease, Osteoporosis, and diabetes. The thyroid gland produces thyroxin (T3, and T4) which is necessary for normal development of the nervous system. Its functions include: promoting growth, increasing basal metabolic rate and controlling body temperature. Adequate iodine intake is necessary for the production of thyroid hormone. According to Payton R. G. et al., a common disorder of the thyroid gland is hypothyroidism, which is more prevalent in women than in men. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include cold intolerance, weight gain, fatigue, anemia, difficulty concentrating, amenorrhea, bradycardia (low heart rate) and goiter. Another hormone that is secreted by Para follicular cells of the thyroid gland is calcitonin. Calcitonin works in an antagonistic fashion with parathyroid hormone (PTH): both regulate the level of calcium in the blood. Blood calcium level is tightly regulated by these two hormones. The cells of our bone that is involved in bone formation and bone breakdown is osteoblast and osteoclast respectively. Osteoclasts are cells of bones that promote bone demineralization or bone resorption. In contrast, Osteoblast promotes calcium absorption by the bone therefore, promoting bone mineralization and formation of new bones. Thus Calcitonin activates osteoblasts, therefore decrease blood calcium levels by decreasing bone breakdown (resorption) by inhibiting osteoclast. Whereas, PTH activates osteoclast and thereby increases blood calcium. The hormone produced by the thyroid gland has big impact on bone density, blood calcium levee. Abnormalities of the thyroid gland impact bone disease such as osteoporosis, a condition that is common in women but men can be diagnosed with this silent disease as well as it mainly affects elderly individual. In addition to the thyroid gland, Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the absorption of calcium. In fact, Vitamin D is needed for efficient absorption of calcium and therefore proper bone health. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, as well, it is unique because it is considered as a hormone; synthesized endogenously in the liver in form of Cholecalciferol. The endogenous inactive form of Vitamin D is Cholecalciferol or Vitamin D3 which is converted to active form of Vitamin D‚ÄìCalcitriol also known as 1, 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol in the Kidney upon exposure to UV ray of sun light. Deficiency in Vitamin D or renal disease contributes to bone disorder such as in Osteomalacia in adult and Rickets in children. Osteomalacia is the softening of bones due to poor bone mineralization which is in turn due to poor calcium absorption. Ultimately, these hormonal changes in body; such as function of thyroid, parathyroid, liver and kidney disrupts metabolic changes as well as function of specific organs, which in turn leads to condition that are not desirable such as bone disorders or other endocrine related diseases. Diagnosis Bone disease is common among the elderly individual, but adolescents can be diagnosed with this disorder as well. There are many bone disorders such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypothyroidism. Although there are many forms of bone disorders, they all have one thing in common; abnormalities of specific organs involved, deficiency in vitamin D or low Calcium in diet, which results in poor bone mineralization. ManagementEpidemiology Endocrine disorder is more common in women than men, as it is associated with menstrual disorders.

Per Census of India, 70% of Indians live in villages. 80% of the villages have a population of less than 1000 people and each consists of a cluster of hamlets (e.g. dhani, nesada, pada, bigha). Most dhanis are nucleated settlements, while others are more dispersed. A dhani could be as small as one isolated house for a single family or a small cluster of several houses which could grow in number with successive generations, and even become a village by itself. All families living in a dhani are relatives or at least are of the same caste.

Houses in dani nowadays are made of modern brick and mortar, specially in affluent higher-per-capita-income states of Haryana and Punjab, and some richer families of Rajasthan. A hamlet is called \\"Nesada\\" (‡™®‡´á‡™∏‡™æ‡™°‡™æ) in Gujarat, \\"Pada\\" (‡§™‡§æ‡§°‡§æ, for example Nagpada and Patlipada) in Maharashtra, \\"Bigha\\" (‡§¨‡§ø‡§ò‡§æ, for example Bhagan Bigha and Jhakar Bigha) in Bihar.  Etymology  The word dhan (‡§ß‡§® in Hindi, ‡§ß‡§£ in Haryanvi and Rajasthani languages) means wealth or possession,1997, \\"A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province\\", vol 1, pp 50. and dhani means wealthy in English (‡§ß‡§®‡•Ä in Hindi, ‡§ß‡§£‡•Ä in Haryanvi and Rajasthani). Thus, in the context of a hamlet, the corrupted form of Hindi word dhani is pronounced dhaani (‡§¢‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä)\\"Chokdi Dhani, the fine hamelt\\". in Haryanvi and Rajasthani languages, which implies the \\"wealth or possessed settlement\\" (of the owner). Hence, Dahni's name usually have a prefix, such as \\"xyz's Dhani\\", where \\"xyz\\" is either the name or gotra of founder-owner. Examples include Garodia Ki Dhani, Ghaslo Ki Dhani, Gujjaro ki Dhani, Meharon Ki Dhani, Navora Ki Dhani, Pujari Ki Dhani, Salamsingh Ki Dhani, Dhab Dhani and Nimakidhani. Example of gotra based dhani include Dhab Poonia. Caste system Usually there is one specific caste (such as Jat, Gujjar, Rajput, Meena, etc.) or more typically a specific gotra (Jaglan, Dhillon, Gehlot, etc.) of a particular caste that comprises all or the bulk of population of dhani. Dhanis as origin of Chak During the British Raj when new canals were built to irrigate barren (bangar, barani and bagar tract) areas of Punjab region, to farm the land migrant farmers were brought in to settle into those areas around the core of new villages [which started out as dhanis].

Between 2010 and 2014, health care spending increased from $1,705 per capita to $2,062 per capita. Cyprus has a multi-payer health care system that consists of a public and private sector. The public sector is funded by payroll, earnings taxes, and employer contributions. The public sector healthcare provides social insurance for the employed, self-employed, and for several types of civil servant.  General Healthcare System (GeSY)  In 2013 Cyprus decided to establish a national health care system, with support from creditors of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and European Commission. A Cyprus national health system was predicted to increase coordination, reduce waste, and be more fiscally responsible. Inefficiencies in the system include overlapping services between the public and private health service providers and \\"poor communication and coordination\\" between the sectors. Cyprus ranks the highest among European Union nations on out-of-pocket health spending. Public healthcare operates with the state's Ministry of Health providing control and funding. Cyprus outperforms the EU average of dentists per capita (91 for every 100,000 people) and underperforms in pharmacists per capita (21 for every 100,000 people). George Pamporidis, the Minister of Health, announced in September 2015 that he intended to establish a National Health Service by 2017. He has previously pledged to clear our corruption in Cyprus' public hospitals. Establishment of an operational NHS was a promise Cyprus made as part of the bailout programme with the Troika of international lenders. Pamporidis proposed a 2% special tax (1% for employers and 1% for employees) to finance a \\"mini-NHS\\". The current dual sector system is in the process of being replaced with a national health system that aims to provide universal coverage. The National Health System was supposed to save ‚Ç¨292 million from 2016-2025 compared to the predicted expenditures of the current system. The public health sector managed by the Ministry of Health provided free services to approximately 83% of the population. Public coverage includes dental, mental health and pharmaceutical services, as well as general public health resources. The three government bills and regulations introducing the General Healthcare System, GeSY, were agreed by parliament on 16 June 2017. It is supposed to be fully operational by 1 July 2020. Collection of contributions for the first stage of implementation started on 1 March 2019. OKYpY Sir David Nicholson was appointed chairman of the newly established State Health Services Organisation (Greek: ŒüŒöŒ•œÄŒ• (OKYpY)) in 2018. Thomas Antoniou is the president. In March 2019 it was reported that more than 1,200 doctors have signed up to work for it. About 1,300-1,400 doctors will be required for its first phase.

He specializes in second language acquisition, which he investigates on both theoretical and practical levels, using techniques from psycholinguistics, applied linguistics, and cognitive psychology. Research VanPatten was the creator of the educational television show Destinos, which is designed for use with Spanish courses. He worked with the theory of input processing in second language acquisition, which aims to offer an explanation on how L2 learners process input. This term was first used by professor Bill VanPatten. Since he grew up in a multilingual home environment he strongly believes in the huge benefits being able to speak, read and write. VanPatten considered that most people have looked language as something static, therefore there is a rule to learn it by practicing and then when it is enough relevant it is on your head. However, VanPatten considers that in learning language, first, you have to process language by hearing and reading in order to get enough data to build up over time the linguistic system. To exemplify this theory, VanPatten mentions that you just have to give people a couple of chunks of language and make them do something with them so that they have to process language somehow, thus to see how language grows in the brain.

Plot Bluestone is a Broadway composer who is in the middle of writing a musical when he discovers via a mysterious visitor‚Äîimplied to be the Devil‚Äîthat he has suffered a fatal heart attack. After stewing over his own loss and his widow's proposed reaction to his death, Bluestone is offered a small gift by the visitor, whose name is Prince (of Darkness).

Bluestone's wish is to \\"make it\\" with gorgeous Mary Ellen Cosgrove - his high school crush - back in October 1948, so he accepts Prince's offer. Bluestone, whose real name is Blaustein, finds himself at a party in his teenhood. He interacts with his old friends, then approaches Laura (Gina Gershon), a classmate who is possessed by Prince. Bluestone has a conversation with Prince and then sees Teresa Golowitz, who he claims is one of \\"the plain girls\\" Mary Ellen invites to make herself look better. Prince reminds Bluestone that Golowitz is the girl who committed suicide that night because she wanted to escape as much as he did.

The party appears to love their chemistry, but she still feels out of place. So, he attempts to explain how she could be a fantastic singer and change her life. She leaves and he ends up in Mary Ellen's bedroom, but he decides to leave as well. He finds Teresa outside and they arrange to meet the next day.

In its popular form, the lyra was a pear-shaped instrument with three to five strings, held upright and played by stopping the strings from the side with fingernails. The first known depiction of the instrument is on a Byzantine ivory casket (900‚Äì1100 AD), preserved in the Bargello in Florence (Museo Nazionale, Florence, Coll. Carrand, No.26). Versions of the Byzantine lyra are still played throughout the former lands of the Byzantine Empire: Greece (Politiki lyra, lit. \\"lyra of the City\\" i.e. Constantinople), Crete (Cretan lyra), Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Croatia (Dalmatian Lijerica), Italy (Calabrian lira) and Armenia. History The most likely origin is the pear-shaped pandura, however with the introduction of a bow. The first recorded reference to the bowed lyra was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lyra (l≈´rƒÅ) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the salandj (probably a bagpipe). Together with the Arabic rabab, lira is considered by many as the ancestor of European bowed instruments. The lyra spread widely via the Byzantine trade routes that linked the three continents; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms fiddle and lira interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments. In the meantime, the rabƒÅb, the bowed string instrument of the Arabic world, was introduced to Western Europe possibly through the Iberian Peninsula and both instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments such as the medieval rebec, the Scandinavian and Icelandic talharpa. A notable example is the Italian lira da braccio, a 15th-century bowed string instrument which is considered by many as the predecessor of the contemporary violin. Terminology From the organological point of view, the Byzantine lyra is in fact an instrument belonging to the family of bowed lutes; however, the designation lyra (Greek: ŒªœçœÅŒ± ~ l≈´rƒÅ, English: lyre) constitute of a terminological survival relating to the performing method of an ancient Greek instrument. The use of the term lyra for a bowed instrument was first recorded in the 9th century, probably as an application of the term lyre of the stringed musical instrument of classical antiquity to the new bowed string instrument. The Byzantine lyra is sometimes informally called a medieval fiddle, or a pear-shaped rebec, or a kemanche, terms that may be used today to refer to a general category of similar stringed instruments played with a horsehair bow. Characteristics The Byzantine lyra had rear tuning pegs set in a flat peg similarly to the medieval fiddle and unlike the rabƒÅb and rebec. However, the strings were touched by the nails laterally and not pressed from above with the flesh of the finger such as in the violin. The lyra depicted on the Byzantine ivory casket of Museo Nazionale, Florence (900 ‚Äì 1100 AD) has two strings and pear-shaped body with long and narrow neck. The soundboard is depicted without soundholes and as a distinct and attached piece, however this might be due to stylistic abstraction. The lyras of Novgorod (1190 AD) are closer morphologically to the present bowed lyras (see gallery): they were pear-shaped and 40 cm long; they had semi-circular soundholes and provision for three strings. The middle string served as a drone while fingering the others by finger or fingernail alone, downwards or sidewards against the string, for there was no fingerboard to press them against: a method which gives the notes as clearly as the violin and remains normal in lyras both in Asia as well as on present bowed instruments in post-Byzantine regions such as the Cretan lyra. In use today The lyra of the Byzantine empire survives in many post-Byzantine regions until the present day even closely to its archetype form. Examples are the Politiki lyra (i.e. lyra of the Polis, or City, referring to Constantinople) () also known as the Classical kemence (Turkish: Klasik kemen√ße or Armud√Æ kemen√ße) from Constantinople, used in today's Turkey and Greece, the Cretan lyra () and the one used in the Greek islands of the Dodecanese, the gadulka () in Bulgaria, the gusle in Serbia and Montenegro, the Calabrian lira () in Italy, and the Pontic lyra (Greek: œÄŒøŒΩœÑŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ ŒªœçœÅŒ±; Turkish: Karadeniz kemen√ße) in the Pontic Greek communities, that existed (or still exist) around the shores of the Black Sea. The gudok, a historical Russian instrument that survived until the 19th century, is also a variant of the Byzantine lyra. Similarly to the lyras found at Novgorod, the Cretan lyra, the Gadulka, the Calabrian Lira and the Greek lyras of Karpathos, Macedonia, Thrace and Mount Olympus are manufactured from a single wood block (monoblock), sculpted into a pear-shaped body. The slightly rounded body of the lyra is prolonged by a neck ending on the top in a block which is also pear-shaped or spherical. In that, are set the pegs facing and extending forward. The soundboard is also carved with a shallower arch and has two small semi-circular, D-shaped soundholes. The Cretan lyra is probably the most widely used surviving form of the Byzantine lyra, except that in Crete instrument-making has been influenced by that of the violin. Currently, numerous models tend to integrate the shape of the scroll, the finger board and other morphology of some secondary characteristics of the violin. The modern variants of the lyra are tuned in various ways: LA‚ÄìRE‚ÄìSOL (or a‚Äìd‚Äìg, i. e. by fifths) on the Cretan lyra; LA‚ÄìRE‚ÄìSOL (or a‚Äìd‚Äìg, where SOL [=g] is a perfect fourth higher than RE [=d] rather than a fifth lower) in Thrace and on Karpathos and the Dodecanese; LA‚ÄìLA‚ÄìMI (a‚Äìa‚Äìe, with the second LA [=a] an octave lower), in Drama; MI‚ÄìSOL‚ÄìMI (e‚Äìg‚Äìe, i. e. a minor third and a major sixth) on the gadulka; LA‚ÄìRE‚ÄìLA (a‚Äìd‚Äìa, a fifth and a fourth) on the Classical Kemenche.

An 80 mm shot of a crescent Moon with a 10-second exposure, revealing earthshine. The green ghost image was caused by a UV filter on the lens. Earthlight is the diffuse reflection of sunlight reflected from Earth's surface and clouds. Earthshine (an example of planetshine), also known as the Moon's ashen glow, is the dim illumination of the otherwise unilluminated portion of the Moon by this indirect sunlight. Earthlight on the Moon during the waxing crescent is called \\"the old Moon in the new Moon's arms\\", while that during the waning crescent is called \\"the new Moon in the old Moon's arms\\". This phenomenon is most visible from Earth at night (or astronomical twilight) a few days before or after the day of new moon, when the lunar phase is a thin crescent. On these nights, the entire lunar disk is both directly and indirectly sunlit, and is thus unevenly bright enough to see. Earthshine is most clearly seen after dusk during the waxing crescent (in the western sky) and before dawn during the waning crescent (in the eastern sky). The term earthlight would also be suitable for an observer on the Moon seeing Earth during the lunar night, or for an astronaut inside a spacecraft looking out the window. Arthur C.

Several of his songs became hit records, including \\"A Satisfied Mind\\", \\"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\\", \\"Conscience I'm Guilty\\", \\"The Waltz of the Angels\\", \\"Beautiful Lies\\", and \\"Till the Last Leaf Shall Fall\\". Inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972 (posthumously), he is most recently celebrated as one of the founding fathers of Rockabilly, having written specifically for Gene Vincent and Capitol Records. He was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in 2009. Jack Rhodes memorabilia is currently on exhibit at the Mineola Historical Museum in Mineola, Texas and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in Nashville. Rhodes is recognized for the groundbreaking rockabilly songs \\"Rockin' Bones\\", \\"Action Packed\\", and \\"Woman Love\\". Revered as an influential mentor for many an upstart artist in the mid to late 1950s, he and his collaborators wrote many songs for Gene Vincent while on the Capitol label. BMI awarded him for over a million radio broadcasts for \\"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\\", and he has received numerous gold records for various releases. One of these was a US country music #1 hit with \\"A Satisfied Mind\\" by Porter Wagoner. Biography Jack Rhodes was born on January 12, 1907 in Martin's Mill, Texas, an unincorporated community located in Van Zandt County. Little is known about his early childhood except that he never completed school. The 1940 U.S. Census indicates that Rhodes' highest level of education was through the 6th grade in primary school. Like many school-age children during that period, he quit to help support his family. He had five siblings and one step brother. During World War II, he worked in the Houston, Texas shipyards. Rhodes started his career as a songwriter after breaking his back in a work-related accident. While recovering, he began writing songs, trying to stave off the boredom of being bedridden. Rhodes owned a caf√© in Grand Saline, Texas, and later opened The Trail 80 Motor Courts, a gas station and restaurant in Mineola, Texas. Leon Payne (Rhodes' step-brother) wrote \\"I Love You Because\\", which has been covered by ‚Äî among others ‚Äî Elvis Presley (Elvis Presley LP, 1956), Al Martino (Billboard Hot 100 #3, 1963), Jim Reeves (UK Singles Chart #5, 1964), Johnny Cash, Matt Monro and Slim Whitman. Rhodes' married Gladyce Lucile Yates in 1929. They had three sons, Bobby, Billy Jack, and Don, and a daughter, Wanda. Rhodes divorced Lucile sometime prior to his marriage to second wife, Loretta Joyce Williams in 1955. Rhodes and Loretta had one son, Buddy, in 1956. In October 1968 Rhodes died of a heart attack while at home, having just returned from Nashville with his intent on retirement. Career Throughout his early years, Jack Rhodes formed several hillybilly/western swing groups with his step-brother Leon Payne, The Lone Star Buddies being among the most famous. The group released several singles and were regulars at The Louisiana Hayride, as well as performing throughout East Texas and Louisiana. Rhodes would often record demos at KWKH in Shreveport and other surrounding radio stations, before creating his own studio in Mineola, Tx. He also formed The Jack Rhodes Ramblers, Jack Rhodes and The Trail 80 Boys, and Jack Rhodes and The Trail 80 Roundup. Rhodes founded his own record label, \\"National Sounds\\", under his company, All-Roads Music Publishing. Rhodes also owned Red Ball Music Publishing. Pressings from his \\"National Sounds\\" label are rare and sought after by collectors.

It was imposed by certain nations in the past, before the drafting of the United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT). The length of an indefinite imprisonment was determined during imprisonment based on the inmate's conduct. The inmate could have been returned to society or be kept in prison for life. Such a sentence is unconstitutional today, particularly in the United States. Rationale The main reason for imposing indefinite (as opposed to fixed) sentences is to protect the community. An offender can then be kept behind bars until it is determined the offender would not pose any danger to society. In some places, indefinite sentences have been around for a long time. In other jurisdictions, they have been introduced more recently. Australia Queensland's Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 authorised the continued detention of sex offenders who had served their term of imprisonment. The other Australian states followed with similar legislation. =Tasmania= An offender who is at least 17 years of age and has been convicted of at least two violent or sexual offences can be declared a dangerous offender and detained indeterminately. A judge must consider the potential of future harm that could be caused by the offender, the circumstances of the offenses, medical and psychiatric opinion, and any other matters of relevance. The decision passed by the court is not reviewable; the indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and release is only by way of an order from the Supreme Court. Seven Tasmanian offenders are serving one or more consecutive sentences of indefinite imprisonment as of July 2012. =Western Australia= The Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA) and the Crimes (Serious and Repeat Offenders) Act 1992 (WA) contain provisions for the indeterminate incarceration of youths and adults convicted of particular offenses. The indeterminate sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and are reviewed every three years after that. Release is through a Supreme Court Order or at the discretion of the Governor. Paedophile Mark Pendleton is currently serving an indefinite sentence to commence on the expiration of 27 years for sexual offences committed against girls between 1977 and 1996, possessing child pornography in his cell, and being the ringleader of a conspiracy with fellow paedophiles to abuse children in Thailand.Paedophile Mark Pendleton sentenced to more jail time for sexually abusing two girls Another paedophile, Christian Michael Roach, was sentenced to three consecutive indefinite terms to commence on the expiration of 27 years in 2008 for drugging and molesting nine young women and girls and the manslaughter of one of them between 1987 and 1999, but he hanged himself in his cell ten days after being sentenced. =Northern Territory and South Australia= The Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT) and the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988 (SA) allow for the indefinite incarceration of a person who is determined to be a habitual criminal and/or incapable of controlling sexual urges. In South Australia, the indefinite sentence(s) commence upon the expiration of any determinate sentence imposed, and are reviewed every three years after that. Release is only by way of an order from the Supreme Court. In the Northern Territory, a prisoner serving one or more indefinite sentence(s) has a nominal sentence set at 70% of the sentence that would have been imposed if the prisoner were not dangerous, 20 years (25 years in some circumstances) if the sentence imposed would have been one or more consecutive sentences of life imprisonment, or any other term as is fixed by the court. The indeterminate sentence must be reviewed by the court when the nominal sentence has expired and every three years afterward. =Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Victoria= The Sentencing Act 2005 (ACT), the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 (Qld), and the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) concern habitual offenders. An offender can be incarcerated indefinitely if there is a high probability because of the offender's character, nature of their offense, psychiatric evidence as to the danger of the defendant and any other relevant circumstances that the offender poses a serious threat to the community. The indeterminate sentence must be reviewed by the court when the nominal sentence has expired and every three years afterward. The minimum nominal sentence that can be imposed is ten years, but the sentencing judge can extend it if the prisoner's criminal history or the nature of the prisoner's offending warrants it. The longest nominal sentence on one or more sentences of indefinite imprisonment is 30 years, currently being served by serial pedophile Geoffrey Robert Dobbs (Queensland), who pleaded guilty to 124 sex offences and one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice committed against 63 girls under his care as a teacher and youth leader aged between one month and 15 years (including five family members) from 1972 to 2000. Canada In Canada, an inmate classified as a dangerous offender can be given an indefinite prison sentence. That means the offender is at risk for causing a \\"serious personal injury.\\" New Zealand In New Zealand, indefinite imprisonment is called preventive detention and is handed down to individuals aged 18 or over convicted of a qualifying violent or sexual offences if it is likely that the offender will re-offend even if given the maximum term of imprisonment otherwise allowed. Such individuals will not receive parole unless they can demonstrate they no longer pose a threat to the community. Preventive detention has a minimum period of imprisonment of five years, but the sentencing judge can extend that if the nature of the prisoner's offending or the prisoner's criminal history warrants it. The longest minimum period of imprisonment on a sentence of preventive detention is one of 28 years, which was given in 1984. United KingdomEngland and Wales= Imprisonment for public protection was a form of indefinite sentence that was used in England and Wales from 2005 until 2012, in addition to the traditional life sentence. The imprisonment for public protection sentence was abolished in 2012, but offenders already serving that sentence remained in prison. =Scotland= In Scotland, the Order for Lifelong Restriction was implemented by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, which gives a judge of the High Court of Justiciary the power to impose a sentence for serious violent and sexual offences, that includes the life imprisonment or detention of the offender. The offender is subject to a process of risk assessment and risk management by the Risk Management Authority through a Risk Management Plan, which includes ways to manage the risks from the offender in prison and, where allowed by risk assessment, through release on licence. Should an offender be released from prison or detention they will be subject to more intensive supervision, treatment, and monitoring. United States Indefinite imprisonment does not exist in the United States as it violates the U.S. Constitution.See, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001) (\\"A statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause forbids the Government to deprive any person . . . of . . . liberty . . . without due process of law. Freedom from imprisonment‚Äîfrom government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint‚Äîlies at the heart of the liberty that Clause protects.\\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Indeterminate sentencing orders existed in every U.S. state from the 1930s to the mid-1970s. Such sentences were abolished by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Model Penal Code, developed in the 1950s, focused on offenders' treatment needs rather than on retribution. Generous amounts of good conduct time could be awarded by prison officials. By the mid-1970s, indeterminate sentencing was under attack, as arguments were made that racial and other invidious biases influenced officials; that rehabilitative treatment programs were ineffective; and that broad, standardless discretion denied constitutional due process and permitted undue leniency that undermined the deterrent effects of sanctions. Federal supervised release is also sometimes cited as an example of indeterminate sentencing.

He began writing his book Migei Haharega Lesha'ar Hagai (From the Valley of Slaughter to the Gate of the Valley) in the wake of the Adolf Eichmann trial, when court testimony by survivors prompted Israelis to openly and publicly discuss what the survivors had lived through. His Life Virtzberg was born in Altona, Hamburg, Germany, to Gabriel Gustav, a merchant, and Rachel, a university graduate and homemaker. Alarmed by the events of Kristallnacht in 1938, the family relocated to Poland and moved into the Jewish quarter in Sosnowiec. They were subsequently transferred to the ≈örodula ghetto during the war, and on August 1, 1943 the ghetto was liquidated, and they were sent to Auschwitz. Virtzberg's mother was killed upon their arrival at the camp. Virtzberg and his father were separated from one another, prompting Virtzberg to turn to one of the Nazi officers nearby and ask him to let the two of them stay together. By fate, the officer he approached was Josef Mengele, who supervised the selection of prisoners in the camp. Mengele opted to spare the father's life, and young Beni was assigned to work in the camp hospital where Mengele conducted his notorious experiments. For several weeks he served as Mengele's personal servant and errand boy. Mengele spared Virtzberg's father from subsequent selections, and assigned the father to a block where Virtzberg was able to smuggle him food. In January 1945, with Allied troops approaching, Auschwitz was vacated and its remaining prisoners were forced into a death march in an attempt to conceal evidence of the atrocities that took place there. Virtzberg's father was too ill to walk, and when he finally collapsed an S.S. soldier shot and killed him as Virtzberg watched in horror. After he was liberated, Virtzberg spent a few months in the town of Santa Maria in Italy before immigrating to Israel as part of the Youth Aliyah in November 1945. There he was taken in by members of Kibbutz Givat HaShlosha, where he trained for service in the Palmach, the military force organized by Jews in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. He joined the Palmach in February 1948 and fought in 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. During the war he participated in efforts to break the blockade of Jerusalem's Jewish residents, and later he joined in the battles down in Negev Desert, during which four of his brothers in arms were killed. After his release from the army, Virtzberg married Rachel Issachar (Bashari), a native of Rehovot of Yemenite ancestry who like Vitzberg fought in the Palmach. Virtzberg worked for the Jewish National Fund as a forester, and later directed the research department for the Southern region forestry operation. During his tenure there, he developed the Liman irrigation system, a technique inspired by Nabataean irrigation methods. His book, which was published in 1967, did not meet with commercial success and was eclipsed by the flood of books published following Israel's victory in the Six-Day War. The book chronicled his experiences and those of nine friends who like him survived the Holocaust, immigrated to Israel, and participated in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. He wrote: \\"Ten children together left the gates of death, six of us were left, not six orphaned children but six fighters. We fought and will fight when necessary, so that Jewish children, wherever they are, shall never become orphaned as we were.\\" The Israeli historian Avihu Ronen described Virtzberg's book as follows: \\"This is a unique book that was ahead of its time, and includes extremely important and authentic personal testimony. Virtzberg's story is importantly unique and has no parallel among the various testimonials and stories from the Holocaust.\\" On August 4, 1968, a little over a week before turning 40 and plagued with depression, Virtzberg took his own life and shot himself in his family home, leaving behind his wife Rachel, a son, Ilan Virtzberg, who went on to become an acclaimed songwriter and performer, and a daughter, Dahlia. At his funeral, the chief rabbi of Beer-Sheba, Rabbi Eliyahu Kushelevsky, eulogized him by noting: \\"Eichmann killed him twenty-five years ago. But we only received the body today.\\" Autobiography Virtzberg's book was unusual for its time. It was the first eyewitness account by a Holocaust survivor in which the State of Israel played an essential role in the narrative: Virtzberg's account went beyond his experiences in the camps and described how he immersed himself in his adopted new homeland and how he participated in the armed struggle for its existence. It was one of the few books in Israel at the time to offer harrowing details of life in the Nazi concentration camps. Although the Eichmann trial had broken the implicit taboo among Israelis regarding the Holocaust, many survivors, including those who had written for most of their lives, remained uncomfortable committing their experiences to paper for various reasons. Virtzberg decided to lay bare his past as an uprooted refugee despite having willingly forged a new Israeli identity and all but erased his diaspora identity. By his own admission, writing the book was an emotionally wrenching process. His book describes life in Auschwitz from the vantage point of a minor, and offers a rare perspective on Dr. Mengele and his experiments on human subjects. On the one hand, Virtzberg's narrative challenged the conventional view at the time of survivors as \\"human dust\\" who passively accepted the generosity of their Israeli saviours. But it also challenged more recent narratives that viewed the absorption process as one that was forced upon immigrants. Virtzberg describes voluntarily choosing to be a \\"new Jew.\\" In his book he sought acceptance not just as a fighter and a \\"new Jew\\" but also as someone who identified himself as an \\"old Jew.\\" At the time, Israelis had only partial knowledge about the Holocaust, which fed negative stereotypes and hasty judgments towards Holocaust survivors. The Israeli author Rivka Gurfine, writing in 1965, described a partition separating survivors from the Israeli native population: \\"Fate, which honors the daring and protects the courageous, dictated that those who accepted their deaths and walked towards it thousands of times remained like a flag planted atop ruins, as bearers of a grand legend. How unfortunate it is that even these days, their hard journey has not yet ended, even after being drawn to the source of strength, their lighthouse, whose light drew them from all depths; their blood is laced with memories and echoes that provide them both a burden and an asset. It requires great effort, both ours and theirs, to bring down the partition that the past has erected, their unique past of which we have no part.\\" From \\"Ruzka Korchak- marle ‚Äì The Personality and Philosophy of Life of a Fighter\\", Tel Aviv 1988 Through his book, Virtzberg aimed to change this attitude among Israeli natives and remove this partition, but he was unable to achieve his goal. The book did not meet with commercial success. This profoundly affected Virtzberg, who descended into the dark past his book had resurrected. His failure to achieve the goals he set out to accomplish in writing the book turned into an existential threat in the form of a deep depression. His case was another example of the dilemma between writing and life described years later by the Spanish writer Jorge Sempr√∫n, himself a survivor of the Buchenwald concentration camp, whereby those who wrote about their memories too soon often ended up paying for it with their lives. In December 2008 the book was reissued in a new edition by Carmel Publishing, including a new introduction, afterword, and photographs. In August 2017 the book was published in English by Yad Vashem, From Death to Battle: Auschwitz Survivor and Palmach Fighter.http://secure.yadvashem.org/store/product.asp?productid=854 See also * Sh'erit ha-Pletah * The Holocaust in art and literature ReferencesExternal links * Mengele's errand boy: an article in the Haaretz Magazine by Dalia Karpel, February 13, 2009 * No help from Elie Wiesel: in the Haaretz Magazine by Dalia Karpel, February 13, 2009 Category:Personal accounts of the Holocaust Category:1928 births Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jewish writers Category:Palmach members Category:1968 deaths Category:Auschwitz concentration camp survivors Category:Suicides by firearm in Israel Category:Nazi-era ghetto inmates Category:Forestry in Israel Category:People from Altona, Hamburg Category:Israeli memoirists Category:20th-century memoirists ","title":"Beni Virtzberg"},{"id":"21756925","title":"Gene Johnson (high jumper)"},{"id":"21756934","text":"There are 112 genera of mosquitoes, containing approximately 3,500 species.Elbers ARW, Koenraadt CJM, and Meiswinkel R (2015) Mosquitoes and Culicoides biting midges: vector range and the influence of climate change.

In 1882, SWP observed \\"foundations of a wall of good squared masonry, not drafted,\\" south of the village.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 210 =Ottoman era= The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers under the name of Rafidya, as being in the nahiya of Jabal Qubal, part of Sanjak Nablus. It had a population of 9 Muslim households and 6 Muslim bachelors, and 85 Christian households. The villagers paid a fixed tax- rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and/or beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and a press for olive oil or grape syrup; a total of 2,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 134.Note that Petersen, 2005, p. 131 mistakenly calls both communities for Muslim (!), and that he only count the households (hana), and not the bachelors Rafidia was at one time owned by the prominent Touqan family of Nablus. They ceded it to an Arab Christian family with Ghassanid origins from al-Karak, in modern-day Jordan in the 17th century. According to tradition, the family, consisting of a father, and his three sons and daughter had fled al-Karak to avoid marrying the daughter, Rafid, to Emir Udwan, a Muslim prince of the city. They initially migrated to Taybeh through the Dead Sea, but then moved north towards Nablus. At the time, there was one Muslim family in the area, al-Hassouneh, and after the Christian family settled, the two families split the land and the water between themselves equally. The village was named \\"Rafidia\\" in honor of Rafid. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin named it Rafidiyeh, as a village by the road from Jaffa to Nablus.Karmon, 1960, p. 156 In 1838, Robinson found the village to be entirely Christian, and said to contain \\"115 taxable men, or nearly 500 inhabitants.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 137 It was noted as being in the Jurat 'Amra district, south of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 127 In 1863, Gu√©rin found the village to have 300 inhabitants, almost all \\"Schismatic Greek\\" families, about 40 Catholic and the rest Muslims. In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine, (=SWP), described Rafidia as \\"a good-sized village on the hill- side, with a spring above it to the north-east and vegetable gardens below.

Churches The Church of St. Justinus of Nablus is a Roman Catholic church built in 1887. In 1907, the Rosary sisterhood arrived in Nablus and Rafidia to serve the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and assist the priest in the service of the church by visiting the families and teaching children. They also set up the Rosary Sisters School in Nablus and Rafidia. As a result of the earthquake that hit Nablus in 1927, the church was damaged, but the Patriarchate renovated it and the church was reopened in 1931. The Church of St. Justinus underwent further renovation and expansion throughout various periods. In 1956, the new bell tower was built and the church was expanded, and then in 1980, the church was again renovated, expanded and painted with frescos and adorned with stained glass windows with church- related drawings. The Protestant Church of St. Matthew the Anglican was formerly a house that was rented in 1932 by the parish. The guest room was used as the church and the other rooms were used as a school for the church from that date on. It was never built as a church, but a house rented out to become a church and a Protestant school.

Ukrainian Emergency Medical Service (UEMS) is a state service, that functions at both a national level (central level) and regional level. The national level is represented by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Ukrainian national disaster and emergency medicine centre.Health Ministry of Ukraine At the Regional level there are 24 regional centres (one for each oblast) and a further special regional centre for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. There are additional municipal command posts in the autonomous cities of Kiev and Sevastopol. Main tasks of the emergency medical services An ambulance in Kiev The main task of the UEMS is to provide first aid and advanced medical assistance through provision of ambulances at any incident where medical care is required. In the case of a large scale disaster, supplementary help can be provided in the form of a mobile hospital of State Emergency Service of Ukraine (MNS). Additionally, the UEMS has the option to request support from private aircraft or those in use by the State Emergency Service, Ministry of Defence and/or any other government agency. Ultimately the emergency medical services of Ukraine seek to provide: * Emergency care for injured and victims after any incident. * Management and provision of infection control and anti- epidemic work in any given disaster area. * Sharing and analysis of information about the medical and social consequences of a disaster. * Responsibility for health of Search and Rescue team members and other medical personnel. * Creation of and rational use of reserves of resources. * Researching scientific problems of disaster and emergency medicine. * Training medical professionals to provide sophisticated medical aid after an incident, with limited recourses. Structure of the UEMS The emergency services act according to Response plans that have been composed for each level. The coordination function of the UEMS is provided by coordinating commissions; such commissions exist at both the central level in the system of Ministry of Health at territorial level. Commissions have coordinated: *Composition and order of using medical personnel and resources for disaster response. *Planning for medical response to major incidents. *Finding ways to improve the functioning of the UEMS. *Training programs for personnel of the UEMS. *Coordination and creation of reserves, medical and material and technical resources.

The study of hydrodynamic stability aims to find out if a given flow is stable or unstable, and if so, how these instabilities will cause the development of turbulence.See Drazin (2002), Introduction to hydrodynamic stability The foundations of hydrodynamic stability, both theoretical and experimental, were laid most notably by Helmholtz, Kelvin, Rayleigh and Reynolds during the nineteenth century. These foundations have given many useful tools to study hydrodynamic stability. These include Reynolds number, the Euler equations, and the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. When studying flow stability it is useful to understand more simplistic systems, e.g. incompressible and inviscid fluids which can then be developed further onto more complex flows. Since the 1980s, more computational methods are being used to model and analyse the more complex flows. Stable and unstable flows To distinguish between the different states of fluid flow one must consider how the fluid reacts to a disturbance in the initial state.See Chandrasekhar (1961) \\"Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic stability\\" These disturbances will relate to the initial properties of the system, such as velocity, pressure, and density. James Clerk Maxwell expressed the qualitative concept of stable and unstable flow nicely when he said: > \\"when an infinitely small variation of the present state will alter only by > an infinitely small quantity the state at some future time, the condition of > the system, whether at rest or in motion, is said to be stable but when an > infinitely small variation in the present state may bring about a finite > difference in the state of the system in a finite time, the system is said > to be unstable.\\" That means that for a stable flow, any infinitely small variation, which is considered a disturbance, will not have any noticeable effect on the initial state of the system and will eventually die down in time. For a fluid flow to be considered stable it must be stable with respect to every possible disturbance. This implies that there exists no mode of disturbance for which it is unstable. On the other hand, for an unstable flow, any variations will have some noticeable effect on the state of the system which would then cause the disturbance to grow in amplitude in such a way that the system progressively departs from the initial state and never returns to it. This means that there is at least one mode of disturbance with respect to which the flow is unstable, and the disturbance will therefore distort the existing force equilibrium.See V.Shankar ‚Äì Department of Chemical Engineering IIT Kanpur (2014), \\"Introduction to hydrodynamic stability\\" Determining flow stabilityReynolds number= A key tool used to determine the stability of a flow is the Reynolds number (Re), first put forward by George Gabriel Stokes at the start of the 1850s. Associated with Osborne Reynolds who further developed the idea in the early 1880s, this dimensionless number gives the ratio of inertial terms and viscous terms.See J.Happel, H.Brenner (2009, 2nd edition) \\"Low Reynolds number hydrodynamics\\" In a physical sense, this number is a ratio of the forces which are due to the momentum of the fluid (inertial terms), and the forces which arise from the relative motion of the different layers of a flowing fluid (viscous terms). The equation for this is : R_e = \\\\frac{\\\\text{inertial}}{\\\\text{viscous}} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho u^2}{\\\\frac{\\\\mu u}{L}} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho u L}{\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{u L}{ u} where : \\\\rho = \\\\text{density} : \\\\text{u} = \\\\text{velocity of the fluid flow} : \\\\mu = {\\\\text{dynamic viscosity}} ‚Äì measures the fluids resistance to shearing flows : \\\\text{L} = \\\\text{characteristic length} : u = \\\\text{kinematic viscosity} = \\\\frac \\\\mu \\\\rho ‚Äì measures ratio of dynamic viscosity to the density of the fluid The Reynolds number is useful because it can provide cut off points for when flow is stable or unstable, namely the Critical Reynolds number R_c. As it increases, the amplitude of a disturbance which could then lead to instability gets smaller. At high Reynolds numbers it is agreed that fluid flows will be unstable. High Reynolds number can be achieved in several ways, e.g. if \\\\mu is a small value or if \\\\rho and \\\\text{u} are high values. This means that instabilities will arise almost immediately and the flow will become unstable or turbulent. =Navier‚ÄìStokes equation and the continuity equation= In order to analytically find the stability of fluid flows, it is useful to note that hydrodynamic stability has a lot in common with stability in other fields, such as magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics and elasticity; although the physics is different in each case, the mathematics and the techniques used are similar. The essential problem is modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations and the stability of known steady and unsteady solutions are examined. The governing equations for almost all hydrodynamic stability problems are the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation and the continuity equation. The Navier‚ÄìStokes equation is given by: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{u} - u \\\\, abla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} = - abla p_0 + \\\\mathbf{b}. where *\\\\mathbf{u} = {\\\\text{velocity field of fluid}} *p_0 = {\\\\text{pressure of fluid}} *\\\\mathbf{b} = {\\\\text{body force acting on fluid e.g gravity}} * u = {\\\\text{kinematic viscosity}} *\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} = {\\\\text{partial derivative of the velocity field with respect to time}} * abla = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x},\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right) Here abla is being used as an operator acting on the velocity field on the left hand side of the equation and then acting on the pressure on the right hand side. and the continuity equation is given by: : \\\\frac{D \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}}{Dt} + \\\\rho \\\\, abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}=0 where *\\\\frac{D \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}}{Dt} = {\\\\text{material derivative of the density}} Once again abla is being used as an operator on \\\\mathbf{u} and is calculating the divergence of the velocity. but if the fluid being considered is incompressible, which means the density is constant, then \\\\frac{D \\\\mathbf{\\\\rho}}{Dt}=0 and hence: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} = 0 The assumption that a flow is incompressible is a good one and applies to most fluids travelling at most speeds. It is assumptions of this form that will help to simplify the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation into differential equations, like Euler's equation, which are easier to work with. =Euler's equation= If one considers a flow which is inviscid, this is where the viscous forces are small and can therefore be neglected in the calculations, then one arrives at Euler's equations: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla)\\\\mathbf{u} = - abla p_0 Although in this case we have assumed an inviscid fluid this assumption does not hold for flows where there is a boundary. The presence of a boundary causes some viscosity at the boundary layer which cannot be neglected and one arrives back at the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation. Finding the solutions to these governing equations under different circumstances and determining their stability is the fundamental principle in determining the stability of the fluid flow itself. =Linear stability analysis= To determine whether the flow is stable or unstable, one often employs the method of linear stability analysis. In this type of analysis, the governing equations and boundary conditions are linearized. This is based on the fact that the concept of 'stable' or 'unstable' is based on an infinitely small disturbance. For such disturbances, it is reasonable to assume that disturbances of different wavelengths evolve independently. (A nonlinear governing equation will allow disturbances of different wavelengths to interact with each other.) Analysing flow stabilityBifurcation theory= Bifurcation theory is a useful way to study the stability of a given flow, with the changes that occur in the structure of a given system. Hydrodynamic stability is a series of differential equations and their solutions. A bifurcation occurs when a small change in the parameters of the system causes a qualitative change in its behavior,. The parameter that is being changed in the case of hydrodynamic stability is the Reynolds number. It can be shown that the occurrence of bifurcations falls in line with the occurrence of instabilities. =Laboratory and computational experiments= Laboratory experiments are a very useful way of gaining information about a given flow without having to use more complex mathematical techniques. Sometimes physically seeing the change in the flow over time is just as useful as a numerical approach and any findings from these experiments can be related back to the underlying theory. Experimental analysis is also useful because it allows one to vary the governing parameters very easily and their effects will be visible. When dealing with more complicated mathematical theories such as Bifurcation theory and Weakly nonlinear theory, numerically solving such problems becomes very difficult and time consuming but with the help of computers this process becomes much easier and quicker. Since the 1980s computational analysis has become more and more useful, the improvement of algorithms which can solve the governing equations, such as the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation, means that they can be integrated more accurately for various types of flow. ApplicationsKelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability= This is an image, captured in San Francisco, which shows the \\"ocean wave\\" like pattern associated with the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability forming in clouds.The Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability (KHI) is an application of hydrodynamic stability that can be seen in nature. It occurs when there are two fluids flowing at different velocities. The difference in velocity of the fluids causes a shear velocity at the interface of the two layers. The shear velocity of one fluid moving induces a shear stress on the other which, if greater than the restraining surface tension, then results in an instability along the interface between them. This motion causes the appearance of a series of overturning ocean waves, a characteristic of the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability. Indeed, the apparent ocean wave-like nature is an example of vortex formation, which are formed when a fluid is rotating about some axis, and is often associated with this phenomenon. The Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability can be seen in the bands in planetary atmospheres such as Saturn and Jupiter, for example in the giant red spot vortex. In the atmosphere surrounding the giant red spot there is the biggest example of KHI that is known of and is caused by the shear force at the interface of the different layers of Jupiter's atmosphere. There have been many images captured where the ocean- wave like characteristics discussed earlier can be seen clearly, with as many as 4 shear layers visible.See the Astrophysical journal letters, volume 729, no. 1 (2009), \\"Magnetic Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability at the Sun\\" Weather satellites take advantage of this instability to measure wind speeds over large bodies of water. Waves are generated by the wind, which shears the water at the interface between it and the surrounding air. The computers on board the satellites determine the roughness of the ocean by measuring the wave height. This is done by using radar, where a radio signal is transmitted to the surface and the delay from the reflected signal is recorded, known as the \\"time of flight\\". From this meteorologists are able to understand the movement of clouds and the expected air turbulence near them. =Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability= This is a 2D model of the Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability occurring between two fluids. In this model the red fluid ‚Äì initially on top, and afterwards below ‚Äì represents a more dense fluid and the blue fluid represents one which is less dense. The Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability is another application of hydrodynamic stability and also occurs between two fluids but this time the densities of the fluids are different.See J.Oakley (2004), \\"Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability notes\\" Due to the difference in densities, the two fluids will try to reduce their combined potential energy.See A.W.Cook, D.Youngs (2009), \\"Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability and mixing\\" The less dense fluid will do this by trying to force its way upwards, and the more dense fluid will try to force its way downwards. Therefore, there are two possibilities: if the lighter fluid is on top the interface is said to be stable, but if the heavier fluid is on top, then the equilibrium of the system is unstable to any disturbances of the interface. If this is the case then both fluids will begin to mix. Once a small amount of heavier fluid is displaced downwards with an equal volume of lighter fluid upwards, the potential energy is now lower than the initial state, therefore the disturbance will grow and lead to the turbulent flow associated with Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instabilities. This phenomenon can be seen in interstellar gas, such as the Crab Nebula. It is pushed out of the Galactic plane by magnetic fields and cosmic rays and then becomes Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor unstable if it is pushed past its normal scale height. This instability also explains the mushroom cloud which forms in processes such as volcanic eruptions and atomic bombs. Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability has a big effect on the Earth's climate. Winds that come from the coast of Greenland and Iceland cause evaporation of the ocean surface over which they pass, increasing the salinity of the ocean water near the surface, and making the water near the surface denser. This then generates plumes which drive the ocean currents. This process acts as a heat pump, transporting warm equatorial water North. Without the ocean overturning, Northern Europe would likely face drastic drops in temperature.

The film is notable for both its Technicolor photography of pre-World War II United States Navy aircraft and as a historical document of the U.S. in 1941,Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, pp. 57‚Äì58. including the aircraft carrier , one of the best known World War II U.S. warships. The film was the last of a collaboration between director Curtiz and actor Errol Flynn which began in 1935 and spanned 12 films.Kinnard and Vitone 1986, p. 74. The cast also includes Fred MacMurray, on loan from Paramount Studios and Alexis Smith in her first credited screen performance. Flynn portrays a Harvard-educated doctor who is involved in heroic medical research on pilots, with MacMurray as the skeptical veteran aviator who gets swept up in the project. The plot is not historically accurate but, depicted in a near-documentary style, the film contains elements of true events that were involved in period aeromedical research, as well as real contemporary medical equipment.Beck, Sanderson. \\"Dive Bomber (1941).\\" san.beck.org, 2002. Retrieved: September 4, 2009. The vivid cinematography prompted the tagline: The stunning spectacle of color rides with you into the heavens!Dive Bomber DVD, 2007. Bert Glennon was nominated for an Oscar for Best Color Cinematography at the 14th Academy Awards in 1942. The movie is dedicated to the flight surgeons of the U.S. armed forces \\"in recognition of their heroic efforts to solve the immensely difficult problems of aviation medicine.\\" The film was a big hit at the box office, rounding out as the 19th highest-grossing film of 1941. Plot During pre-war operations from an aircraft carrier off Hawaii, the VB-3 dive bombing squadron (bearing the \\"High Hat\\" emblem of Bombing Squadron 14) arrives in a wingover approach to Honolulu; one of its pilots blacks out during the high speed dive and crashes. At the base hospital in Honolulu, Lieutenant Commander Joe Blake (Fred MacMurray) is concerned that Lieutenant \\"Swede\\" Larson (Louis Jean Heydt) will not survive. U.S. Navy doctor, Lieutenant Doug Lee (Errol Flynn), convinces the Senior Surgeon, Commander Martin (Moroni Olsen), to operate, but the pilot dies on the operating table. After Blake blames Lee for rushing the surgery, the doctor decides to become a naval flight surgeon and winds up being trained at the U.S. Naval Air Station in San Diego by a number of instructors, including his nemesis, Blake. A sub-plot involving the romantic adventures of Blake, Lee and a group of mechanics, introduces divorcee Linda Fisher (Alexis Smith) as a love interest for the two rivals, Blake and Lee. On completion of his flight training, Lee is posted as an assistant to a senior flight surgeon, Commander Lance Rogers (Ralph Bellamy), who is working to find a solution for altitude sickness that affects pilots in dive bombers. Lee flies with Blake as his pilot in a camera-equipped aircraft and observes Blake blacking out. He experiments with a pneumatic belt that will keep blood above the heart and successfully flight tests it himself, although he disobeys regulations in flying by himself. Even though he has qualified as a Naval Aviator, Lee is still not trusted, considered a \\"grandstand player\\" and a \\"vulture\\", always there when someone crashes. His judgment over pilots' ability to fly is further resented when he grounds a pilot, Lieutenant Tim Griffin (Regis Toomey), who is suffering from chronic fatigue. In anger, Griffin resigns from the Navy and joins the Royal Air Force in Canada, but visits his old squadron when he is ferrying a new fighter from the Los Angeles factory. On his return flight, Griffin suffers from fatigue and dies attempting to land at an emergency field, completely misjudging his approach. Blake finally accepts that the flight surgeon is trying to help pilots survive dangerous high altitude flying, and volunteers as a \\"guinea pig\\" pilot for aerial experiments. The first flight test of a pressurized cabin nearly ends in disaster when the aircraft ices up and Blake passes out, forcing Lee to take over. After ground testing of a new invention jointly developed by Lee and Blake, a pressure suit, Blake is told that he did not pass his most recent flight physical and will be grounded. Taking off without permission, Blake carries out the aerial testing of the new suit anyway, but when the oxygen regulator fails, he loses consciousness and fatally crashes. His notes are salvaged from the wreckage, however, and mass production of the suit can begin. In the final scene, Blake's self-sacrifice is acknowledged while Rogers and Lee are honored for their pioneering work in protecting pilots flying at high altitude. An ongoing motif involving gold cigarette cases from the National Air Races carried by each of the three \\"High Hats\\" squadron leaders continues into the final sequence. Blake is the last of the three to perish in service and Lee throws his cigarette case from one of the squadron's airplanes out over the Pacific as a final tribute.

Based on a screenplay adapted from an original story by Commander Frank \\"Spig\\" Wead, USN (Ret), Dive Bomber features spectacular flying scenes (as in other films with a scenario written by Wead) interwoven into a storyline of medical research undertaken to combat the effects of high \\"G\\" combat maneuvers. The \\"Schneider Index\\" test playing a pivotal role in the plot in the story was actually a cardiovascular fatigue test familiar to pilots of the era. Developed in 1918 by Major Edward C. Schneider, an aviation medicine pioneer with the Air Service of the AEF, it was widely used by the military until World War II, when statistical analysis showed that a much simpler measurement was equally effective. Upon the first reading of the proposed script, the Department of the Navy realized the potential of the film to be a showcase of U.S. Naval Aviation and lent its full support to the production. Dive Bombers working title was \\"Beyond the Blue Sky\\". In December 1940, Warner Bros. originally intended to star James Cagney, George Brent and Ronald Reagan, with Lloyd Bacon directing Dive Bomber.\\"Notes: Dive Bomber.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Fred MacMurray was borrowed from Paramount to star opposite Flynn. In exchange, Paramount borrowed Olivia de Havilland from Warners for Hold Back the Dawn (1941).Churchill, Douglas W. \\"Fred MacMurray will co-star with Errol Flynn in 'Dive Bomber' for Warners.\\" The New York Times, March 3, 1941, p. 11. Pre-production planning began in January 1941, and once the generous $1.7 million budget was established, a tight schedule of two months was determined for principal photography on location. Although the U.S. Navy had agreed to cooperate, providing over 1,000 officers and enlisted men along with access to some of its most highly secured facilities, world events had dictated a full war-readiness, which placed additional pressures on the film cast and crew. With all naval air and sea forces committed to training and war exercises, Curtiz was notified in advance so that he could take advantage of the ongoing activities and set up his camera crews accordingly. =Filming= Dive Bomber was the final film collaboration between Errol Flynn and Michael Curtiz. It was the 12th and most contentious pairing of the high-spirited matinee idol and the fiery director. Throughout the production, an ever-widening rift emerged between the two due to conflicts over the use of actors in demanding and sometimes risky scenes, leading to inevitable clashes and delays in filming. The off-screen moments were fraught with stress for the cast and crew observing the contentious exchanges.Orriss 1984, p. 27. One bizarre incident came about when a formation of aircraft flew over the film set at a time when all the cameras were being reloaded. Curtiz reacted immediately by standing up and waving them off when he realized that the camera crews were not in position. The pilots, who were setting out on a daily exercise, simply ignored the gesticulating and screaming Curtiz below. The film crews were mightily amused by Curtiz's declarations of \\"No, no. Go back!\\" as if the flight crews could actually hear him. The incident was symptomatic of the many outbursts and exchanges on the set when the autocratic Curtiz helmed a film.Dive Bomber: Keep 'Em in the Air 2005. Principal photography began on March 20, 1941 at NAS North Island in San Diego with the famous aircraft carrier , also placed at the disposal of the production crew of 150 actors and technicians for an entire week.Farmer 1989, p. 81.Dougherty, Frank. \\"Hollywood Letter: 'Dive Bomber' on the Way.\\" Christian Science Monitor, April 4, 1941, p. 8. When principal photography commenced, the initial aircraft scenes featured U.S. Navy aircraft in their pre-war colorful schemes, set off by the Technicolor process, making this a vibrant document, unique for its time.Orriss 1984, p. 26. During filming, as war preparations ramped up, the U.S. Navy ordered a new grey color camouflage for all its sea- based aircraft, with the associate producer Robert Lord scrambling to have a concession made where a few aircraft in each squadron would retain their colorful schemes in order to match previously shot footage. The film ultimately uses footage that includes aircraft in this new uniform light-grey color scheme especially in the carrier sequence.Orriss 1984, p. 28. Even though famed aerial pilot and cinematographer Paul Mantz is listed in the credits as the Chief Pilot for Warner Bros., his injuries in a previous accident prevented him from doing the flying and Frank Clarke took over, with Mantz continuing to oversee the air operations.Orriss 1984, p. 25. Although Errol Flynn had a pilot's license, he was expressly forbidden to fly in the production, under threat of suspension from Warner Bros. due to his \\"buzzing\\" the cast and crew of 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood. Flynn did taxi a dive bomber to allow closeups of him in the cockpit during a critical scene when his character \\"is testing a G-resistant belt.\\"Farmer 1989, p. 19. The bulky Technicolor cameras caused considerable problems in the scenes filmed in the air; special mounts were built to allow one of the two cameras in the chase aircraft to be moved back and forth. With the preponderance of actual aerial footage shot from a bevy of camera platforms, both on the ground and mounted to aircraft, Dive Bomber was notable in the restrained use of special effects. During the two months of studio post-production, footage of scale models and closeup \\"blue screen\\" effects were matched up with the aerial sequences. =Aircraft featured= The principal aircraft depicted in Dive Bomber are Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers and Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers, although many other types are included, especially parked, as backdrops. The N3N Canary trainers were the primary type in use at Naval Air Station North Island and are featured prominently in the flight training sequence. All other aircraft were deployed temporarily for training to North Island and were subsequently available for use in the film. An entire squadron of Grumman F3F fighters from the USS Enterprise was flown to NAS North Island with a single example appearing prominently in the penultimate \\"pressure suit\\" scenes both on the ground and in the air. All the aerial closeup work with the cast was photographed later in the studio using a series of realistic mock- ups. Some of the aircraft types used in Dive Bomber were engaged a few months later in combat with the Japanese aerial and naval forces, up to and including the Battle of Midway, while other types were declared obsolescent and relegated to home use when the U.S. geared up for war in earnest. Enterprise is the film's aircraft carrier, and went on to be one of the most famous ships of World War II. Other aircraft types featured in the film include the biplane Curtiss SBC Helldiver (no relation to the SB2C of the same name and manufacturer), Brewster F2A Buffalo (in long shots), and one good shot of a Douglas SBD Dauntless. For security reasons, no bombs or torpedoes are shown. Several of the squadrons featured, and undoubtedly many of the aircrew, such as Bombing Squadron 6 of the Enterprise, later played critical roles at the battles of Coral Sea, Midway, and other World War II engagements. A rare pair of shots are the landing on and subsequent launch from the Enterprise in its pre-war livery, filmed from an aircraft. ReceptionBox Office= Released just months before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Dive Bomber generally was well received by the public while the U.S. Navy lent the new SBD Dauntless dive bomber to be displayed in conjunction with film screenings at principal cities, and set up recruiting booths by the theaters.Orriss 1984, p. 29. The film was Warner's most popular film of 1941, generating a profit in excess of $1 million.Robertson 1994, p. 59.

The game was played at Fenway Park in Boston on the afternoon of Monday, October 2 between the rival New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox to determine the winner of the American League's (AL) East Division. The tie-breaker was necessitated after the Yankees and Red Sox finished the season tied for first place in the AL East with identical records. Entering the final day of the season on Sunday, October 1, the Yankees had a one-game lead; they lost 9‚Äì2 to Cleveland while Boston shut out Toronto 5‚Äì0 to force the playoff. The Red Sox were the home team by virtue of a coin toss. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics. Ron Guidry started for the Yankees, while Mike Torrez started for the Red Sox. The Yankees fell behind 2-0 in the second inning with a home run by left fielder Carl Yastrzemski and an RBI single by right fielder Jim Rice. The Yankees took the lead in the seventh when light- hitting shortstop Bucky Dent lifted a three-run home run over the left field wall to give the Yankees a 3-2 lead. The Yankees added 2 more runs, giving them a 5-2 lead. The Red Sox scored two more runs, but the Yankees ultimately won the game when relief pitcher Goose Gossage got Yastrzemski to pop out to third baseman Graig Nettles to earn the save. Guidry was the winning pitcher, while Torrez was saddled with the loss. With the victory, the Yankees finished the regular season with a record and clinched the AL East championship, en route to winning the World Series. This was the first tie-breaker to be contested after the introduction of divisional play in 1969. , the 1978 Yankees remain the last team to have won the World Series after playing a tiebreaker. Background The Yankees and Red Sox had combined to win the past three American League (AL) pennants. The Red Sox lost the World Series in 1975, the Yankees lost in 1976, and then won in 1977. Heading into 1978, the Yankees, Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles, who had also challenged for the AL East championship in 1977, all expected to contend for the AL East title. The Orioles and Red Sox had tied for second place in 1977, 2¬Ω games behind the Yankees. The young Detroit Tigers, with Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell, also appeared ready to challenge for the AL East. The Red Sox signed Mike Torrez, who won two games in the 1977 World Series for the Yankees, as a free agent during the offseason. Before the season, the Red Sox acquired Dennis Eckersley to join Torrez, Bill Lee, and Luis Tiant in their starting pitching rotation. The Yankees, meanwhile, acquired Goose Gossage and Rawly Eastwick to join Sparky Lyle, 1977's AL Cy Young Award winner, in their bullpen during the offseason. Both teams placed five players on the AL squad for the All-Star Game: Gossage, Ron Guidry, Graig Nettles, Thurman Munson, and Reggie Jackson represented the Yankees, while Carl Yastrzemski, Fred Lynn, Rick Burleson, Carlton Fisk, and Jim Rice represented the Red Sox. The Red Sox had once led the division by ten games; the Milwaukee Brewers were in second place, while the Yankees were in third. The Yankees experienced injuries to Willie Randolph, Catfish Hunter, Bucky Dent, and Mickey Rivers, and fell to fourth place in the division, as Baltimore moved into third. After a shake-up engineered by owner George Steinbrenner, with Munson moving from catcher to right field, the Yankees fired their combustible manager Billy Martin on July 24, replacing him with Bob Lemon. The Yankees had lost four of five after the All-Star break, including a three-game sweep by Kansas City in New York which ended with a club suspension of Reggie Jackson; at , they trailed Boston by fourteen games on the morning of July 19. However, New York finished the season in their last 73 games, while the Red Sox went over the same time frame. This included a four-game sweep of Boston in Fenway Park in early September, in which the Yankees outscored the Red Sox by a composite score of 42‚Äì9; the series was dubbed \\"The Boston Massacre\\" by the sports press. By the end of the four games on Sunday, September 10, the two teams were tied for first place at , with twenty games remaining. The Yankees took the AL East lead three days later, and did not lose it until the final day of the season. The margin was up to 3¬Ω games after another win over the Red Sox on Saturday, September 16, but results were different the next day, the first of Boston's dozen wins over the final two weeks. Clinging to a one-game lead with seven remaining, New York won six straight, but dropped the finale at home to struggling Cleveland on Sunday, October 1. Boston won their final eight games to catch the Yanks; after the Indians' win, a 9‚Äì2 complete game victory by left-hander Rick Waits, the Fenway Park video screen flashed the happy news: \\"THANK YOU RICK WAITS, GAME TOMORROW.\\" The game The tie-breaker game was the first in the AL since 1948, when the Indians defeated the Red Sox for the pennant at Fenway Park, and the first in the majors since the advent of the division system in . Guidry, who had won 24 games in the 162-game regular season,The Morning Record and Journal via Google News Archive Search started on three days of rest, less than usual,Lyle & Golenbock, p. 244 and Torrez started the game for the Red Sox. He started for the Red Sox on Opening Day and had a 16‚Äì12 record, but contributed to the Red Sox struggles late in the season with six consecutive losses. Game time was 2:30 p.m. EDT, televised nationally on ABC. Bucky Dent in 2010 Carl Yastrzemski hit a home run in the second inning, and Jim Rice drove in Rick Burleson with a single in the sixth inning, giving the Red Sox a 2-0 lead. Meanwhile, Torrez held the Yankees to two hits through six innings. With one out in the seventh inning, Chris Chambliss and Roy White of the Yankees both singled off of Torrez, and pinch hitter Jim Spencer flied out. Dent then hit a fly ball that cleared the Green Monster wall in left field for a three-run home run to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì2 lead. Torrez was removed from the game after walking Mickey Rivers. Reliever Bob Stanley came in, and after Rivers stole second Thurman Munson drove him in with a double. In the eighth inning, a home run by Reggie Jackson made the score 5‚Äì2. The Red Sox cut New York's lead to just one run in the bottom of the eighth against closer Goose Gossage on RBI singles by Fred Lynn and Yastrzemski.Lyle & Golenbock, p. 245 But the Yankees would hold off the Red Sox, thanks in part to a heads-up defensive play by right fielder Lou Piniella with one out in the bottom of the ninth. With Burleson on first base, Jerry Remy hit a line drive to Piniella in right field, but Piniella was blinded by the late afternoon sun and could not see the ball. However, he pretended to field the play normally, pounding his glove as though he would easily catch the ball. This prevented Burleson from advancing to third base. When Rice followed with a deep fly to the outfield, Burleson could only move up to third base instead of scoring the tying run. Batting with two out and two men on, Yastrzemski popped out to third baseman Graig Nettles in foul territory for the game's final out, and New York won the game, 5‚Äì4. Guidry improved his record to , while Torrez took the loss; Gossage recorded his 27th save.

ABC Sports picked up the contest for national viewers, and thus provided alternate coverage of the game on its New York and Boston affiliates. Keith Jackson and Don Drysdale narrated the action in the ABC booth. On radio, the CBS Radio Network offered national coverage of the game, with Ernie Harwell doing play-by-play and Win Elliot working as an analyst. Locally in the home markets, WINS in New York City and WITS in Boston fed the game to the teams' respective radio networks. In the Red Sox' broadcast booth, Dick Stockton and Ken \\"Hawk\\" Harrelson worked the television side while Ned Martin and Jim Woods were heard on radio. In the Yankees' booth, Phil Rizzuto, Bill White and Frank Messer alternated play-by- play on both radio and television, and were backed up on radio by Fran Healy. Aftermath For the third straight year, the Yankees went on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1978 American League Championship Series. The Yankees won the best-of-five series for their third consecutive pennant. New York defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series to win their second consecutive championship, and 22nd overall. The loss of the Red Sox was seen as a manifestation of the Curse of the Bambino, long thought to be the reason behind a decades-long litany of failures for the Red Sox after owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees on January 5, 1920. Described as a \\"shocking blast\\" by the Sporting News, Dent's home run silenced the Fenway Park crowd. For the light-hitting Dent, it was just his fifth home run of the 1978 season. It sealed Dent's reputation among Yankee fans, while inspiring the permanent nickname \\"Bucky Fucking Dent\\" in New England. Dent, later the manager of the Yankees, was fired during a series in Boston in 1990. Twenty- five years later, in Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series, Aaron Boone received similar treatment by Red Sox fans after he hit the home run in the bottom of the 11th inning that clinched the pennant for the Yankees, but the Yankees would later lose to the Florida Marlins in the World Series, which went six games.

It was not put into production and the one aircraft built served later as an engine testbed. Development Early in 1926 the Air Ministry issued two specifications, 23/25 for a two-seat day bomber, torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, followed by 24/25 for a high-altitude bomber. These two specifications brought out prototypes from several makers: the Blackburn Beagle, Handley Page Hare, Hawker Harrier, Vickers Vildebeest and Westland Witch. The Goring was Gloster's submission, aimed, like most of the other machines at both specifications. The GoringFlight 24 May 1928 was a single bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span and slight sweep. They were based on spruce spars with internal wire bracing. The lower wing was angled downwards briefly as it left the fuselage, enabling a shorter-than-usual undercarriage. Short struts ran from the wing joint of this centre section to mid-fuselage. The fuselage was also a wooden structure of rectangular cross-section formed by ash longerons. Wings and fuselage were fabric covered. The pilot sat below the upper wing trailing edge with a cutout for visibility. The gunner sat behind in a second open cockpit fitted with a Scarff ring for a Vickers machine gun. The rear cockpit also allowed the gunner to assume a prone position for bombing. The tailplane was strut braced and the fin was low with a broad chord. Both rudder and elevators had horn balances which projected beyond the fixed surfaces. The standard undercarriage was a simple single axle arrangement, but it could be replaced with a split axle unit to allow the carrying and dropping of torpedoes. In addition the Goring could operate as a seaplane. The floats were accompanied by a rudder enlarged by an extension below the fuselage. The Goring originally flew in March 1927 with an uncowled direct-drive 425 hp (315 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI. Later in the year this engine was replaced by a geared 460 hp (345 kW) Bristol Jupiter VIII and flew in both land- and seaplane configurations. Goring on wheeled undercarriage Goring taxying on water Operational history At RAF Martlesham Heath in 1928 the Goring powered by the Jupiter VIII competed with the Hare, Harrier and Witch over the 23/25 specification. In the event none of them satisfied the Air Ministry, probably because they had anticipated higher performing aircraft powered by the supercharged Jupiter VII and X variants which had been unavailable owing to development difficulties. In 1930 the Goring returned to Gloster's works at Hucclecote to be converted once more to a seaplane and it remained in that guise over 1931, doing extensive flying from Calshot. Later it returned as a landplane to test the now airworthy Jupiter XF, at the same time having its fin area reduced by a narrower, straight edged surface. The Goring's final role was as an engine testbed at Bristol's Filton works where it flew in turn with the 745 hp (555 kW) Bristol Mercury VIIA, the 570 hp (425 kW) Bristol Pegasus II and the sleeve valved 670 hp (500 kW) Bristol Perseus II radial engines, the second and third of these at least within a wide chord cowling.

They write women's fiction, mostly set in Britain, featuring humor and romance but their contemporary flawed characters and dramatic situations often revolve around heroines who are slightly older than the average chick lit novel, sometimes married with children or divorced single mothers and with a mystery or even a murder element. They are usually classified as chick lit, satire or mystery categories. Their first book, How to Survive Your Sisters was originally published by Random House. in 2008, followed by a second, When Good Friends go Bad in 2009. In 2014, the sisters reverted the UK rights and republished both books independently with Across the Pond Press through Amazon. Both novels are also published in Italian and German by Mondadori in Italy, in Germany and also translated in Serbia. With their third novel, Looking For La La, - a funny chicklit mystery - Ellie Campbell decided to join the growing ranks of indie authors selling in e-book format as well as paperback through Amazon's KDP program. Looking For La La was followed by a sequel -To Catch A Creeper: a Crouch End Confidential Mystery and in April 2015, they published their fifth book with, Million Dollar Question. Their books frequently appear high in the Amazon bestseller charts in the USA, UK and Australia. In 2014, How To Survive Your Sisters and Looking For La La were also produced as audiobooks with Audible.com, narrated by Elizabeth Klett and Stevie Zimmerman respectively.

Lacking family and friends, she immerses herself in the only thing she has left: her work. As an operator at a paging company, Emma is a modern-day messenger. She begins to find solace by living vicariously through the message she relays... and what once was a dreadful chore becomes an obsession for her. Methodically, Emma retreats from the world around her and starts to substitute her basic need for human contact with these meaningless and impersonal messages. After months without a clue about her husband's disappearance, Emma starts receiving personal and intimate messages that only her husband could write. With nothing to lose but her life, Emma gets involved and follows the lead of the mystifying messages. Caught in an ever-widening web of lies and strange coincidences, Emma realizes that events are not always what they seem, as dark secrets about her previous \\"perfect\\" life begin to surface.

Argentine Automobile Association. The National Museum of Decorative Arts is an art museum in Recoleta, Buenos Aires, Argentina. History The museum has its origins in a marriage in 1897 between two prominent members of turn-of-the-century Argentine high society: Mat√≠as Erraz√∫riz, the son of Chilean √©migr√©s, and Josefina de Alvear, the granddaughter of Independence-era leader Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear. The couple commissioned French architect Ren√© Sergent in 1911 to design a mansion for Erraz√∫riz's future retirement from the diplomatic corps, in which he had been Ambassador to France for a number of years. The ornate Neoclassical structure inspired the Bosch family to commission a similar palace nearby (today the United States Ambassador's residence). Completed in 1916, the couple devoted the following two years to decorating the palace, purchasing a large volume of antiques and other objets d'art. When Mrs. Erraz√∫riz died in 1935, however, the widower bequeathed the mansion to the Argentine government, on his son's and daughter's advice. The National Museum of Decorative Arts was established in 1937. Residence Under Law 12351 the Argentine state bought the residence and the art collections which gave birth to the Museo Nacional de Arte Decorativo on 18 December 1937. The project of the building, a sample of pure eclecticism, was designed by the French architect Ren√© Sergent in 1911 but it was finished in 1917 due to the difficulties caused by the First World War. Sergent's team was a group of selected decorators specialized in interior-decoration and gardens. H. Nelson, G. Hoentschel, M. Carlhian worked the rooms; the gardens were the responsibility of the French expert Achille Duch√™ne. The materials were brought from Europe: wooden panels, mirrors, marble, woodworks, frames, latches; a number of European artisans were called for some of the stucco decorations. Its imposing and sober fa√ßade takes from the French Neo-classicism of the 18th century, especially from the works of Jacques A. Gabriel, architect in the Court of Louis XV. The building has four levels visible from the external fa√ßade: on the basement, the windows of the cellars. Gigantic Corinthian columns in the fa√ßade cover the two most important levels: the principal floor with round arches leading to the garden and terrace and the first floor where the family rooms were installed. On the top floor, in the attic were the rooms of the servants with the windows hidden by a balustrade. =Interior= The Entrance Hall: The walls and the ceiling are completely covered by fake Paris stone. The luxurious stairs lead to the principal floor. Its sumptuous Louis XV style was accomplished including in its decoration Ionic pilasters, arcs and groin vault ceilings. Above the cornice are allegories of the Arts: Music, Architecture, Sculpture and Painting which emphasize the Neoclassic character of the rooms. Antechamber: Decorated in a Neoclassic mode, the Louis XV style is evident in the wooden panels: polished oak with frames and carvings, the ceiling ‚Äì with central lighting ‚Äì is decorated with plaster frames. This is a room that connects with four other rooms and the area of the stairs and the lift. The Great Hall (Renaissance): It is the biggest apartment of the residence and the only one with double height and an axis around which all the activities of the house took place. The ceiling is decorated with caissons and patterned glass; above: a hidden structure of big iron entablature to support five big chandeliers. The floor consists of parquetry with a design of stars combining maple and walnut wood. High windows with colored glass, the decoration of the ceiling, the imposing fireplace and the walls covered with tapestry and wood evoke the great English halls of the 16th century Tudor style. The Dining-room: This luxurious room was planned bearing in mind the frequent dinners and social events offered by Mr Mat√≠as Err√°zuriz and Mrs. Josefina de Alvear. It was inspired by the Versalles Palace and specially its Hercules Room was the chosen model. The baroque atmosphere was accomplished by the combination of marble from Carrara in Italy and from the French Central Massif. The Winter Garden: creates a beautiful connection between the dining-room and the ball room. As far as design is concerned, the selection of sober Louis XVI style has proved fundamental. The color of the walls is in harmony with the golden and pale tones of the walls of the Regency Room. he texture and shades of the marble works replicated in this room by stucco decorations create a total harmony with the panels in the dining-room. The Ball-room: evokes the period of the Regency and the transition from the solemn luxury of the Baroque to the subtle grace of the Rococo. The curves are the outstanding feature of the design. All the frames, the wooden plates joining the ceiling by means of a decidedly curved carving, the angles of the room and the union of the walls with the ceiling are based upon curved lines. The pale colors, the use of the light and its reflections, the abundance of the gilding and of mirror-panels hide the limits of the actual space. The Room of Madame: Comfortable chairs, armchairs, tables and boudoirs of Louis XVIII design were favored by Mrs. Josefina de Alvear's when receiving visitors. The panels of painted wood, the frame woods and ornamental molding remind the visitor of the influence of Marie Antoinette in all the decoration. All the chandeliers, crystal, and bronze were inspired in the decoration of the Versailles' Grand Trianon. The Study of Mr Mat√≠as de Err√°zuriz: is entirely the accomplishment of the French decorator Andr√© Carlhian (1887-1963). Here we can admire the combination of panels of carved, polished oak and some sections in red velvet tapestry. In this Neoclassic room, Don Mat√≠as enjoyed his moments of solitary meditation, surrounded by paintings from the 19th century, Japanese lacquer decorations, and the Chinese hard stones. The First Floor was reserved to the private rooms of the family. Each member had an apartment with a private living-room, bedroom, dressing-room, bathroom and toilette. The Gallery of Tapestries surrounds the Great Hall on three sides. Here we can admire French and Flemish tapestries of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries along with furniture and paintings from the same periods. The \\"Sert\\" room: was the boudoir of Mat√≠as Err√°zuriz Alvear and its name honors the Catalan painter, Josep Maria Sert (1876-1945), who created this decoration in the Art D√©co style. The stucco paneled walls, the enormous entablature, the gilded doors, and the four paintings are part of the project of the Spanish artist. The antechambers and the bedroom of Mat√≠as Err√°zuriz Alvear complete the apartments of the son. These rooms do not have the original furniture, which was taken when the house was sold, but they are presented with an exceptional assembly of furniture and objects of neo-classic style of the period comprised between the era of Louis XVI and Napoleon I. Room Zubov: The room was once a family room. Today it is the site of a collection of miniatures belonging to the Countess Rosario S. de Zubov, dedicated in memory of her daughter Tatiana. In 2000, the Asinari Di Bernezzo collection was added. The whole exhibition shows extraordinary samples of European portraits in miniature from the 16th to 19th centuries. It can be paralleled with the important French and English collections. Collection The museum maintains twelve exhibit halls and nine permanent collections containing over 4,000 objects including: *paintings: notable among them El Greco's Jesus Bearing the Cross Uphill, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard's The Sacrifice of the Rose and √âdouard Manet's Portrait of Abb√© Hurel *sculpture: among them an Ancient Roman Minerva, Cristoforo Mantegazza's Adoration of the Magii (a wall relief in marble) and Auguste Rodin's The Eternal Spring *East Asian art: numerous Chinese vases and jade sculptures from the Qianlong era, among others; as well as tapestries, porcelains, 18th century furniture, the most important public miniature art collection in the Americas and other antiques, generally from before 1800. The collection is also complemented by temporary exhibits, and the museum hosts regular choral concerts as well as classes and seminars. Visitors can also enjoy Caf√© Croque Madame, whose tables are set in the gardens in good weather. Since 1944, the Argentine Academy of Letters has also been housed in this location. = Image = File:El Greco - Jes√∫s con la Cruz a cuestas.jpg Jesus Bearing the Cross Uphill, El Greco File:√âdouard Manet - Portrait de l'abb√© Hurel.jpg Portrait of Abb√© Hurel, √âdouard Manet File:Jean Honor√© Fragonard - El sacrificio de la rosa.jpg The Sacrifice of the Rose, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard File:Jean Baptiste Camille Corot - Vista del Castel Sant'Angelo.jpg Vist of Castel Sant'Angelo, Jean Baptiste Camille Corot File:Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck - Retrato de um cavalheiro, 1651.jpg Portrait of gentelman, Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck File:Rachel Ruysch - Naturaleza muerta.jpg Still life, Rachel Ruysch File:Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida - Josefina de Alvear de Err√°zuriz, 1905.jpg Josefina de Alvear de Err√°zuriz, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla File:Josefina Alvear de Errazuriz, by Giovanni Boldini.jpg Josefina de Alvear de Err√°zuriz, Giovanni Boldini Gallery File:MNAD003.JPG File:Palacio Errazuriz-lado.jpg File:MNAD002.JPG File:Silverware and china, MNAD Argentina.jpg File:MNAD005.JPG File:ID 208 Palacio Errazuriz 0855.jpg File:Palacio Err√°zuriz entrada.jpg File:Museo de Arte Decorativo Esculturas del Jardin.jpg File:ID 208 Palacio Err√°zuriz 5408.jpg File:ID 208 Palacio Errazuriz 0858.jpg References External links  * Category:Decorative arts museums Category:Museums in Buenos Aires Category:Art museums and galleries in Argentina Category:Art museums established in 1916 Category:Art museums established in 1937 Category:Palaces in Buenos Aires Decorative Arts, Buenos Aires Category:1937 establishments in Argentina Category:Historic house museums in Argentina ","title":"National Museum of Decorative Arts, Buenos Aires"},{"id":"21757718","text":"Laguna Celeste is a lake of Bolivia in the Sur L√≠pez Province, Potos√≠ Department.

It was formerly Shanghai Railway Institute, which was moved from Shanghai to Nanchang in 1971 and adopted the current name.Introduction to ECJTU East China Jiaotong University (ECJTU) as one of the renowned multi-disciplinary and comprehensive universities in China, focuses on railway-related disciplines and features the transportation engineering. It was established in 1971, when the State Council approved of combining both College of Locomotive and Rolling Stock in Shanghai Jiaotong University and College of Railway Engineering in Tongji University together to establish Shanghai Railway Institute, which was later renamed East China Jiaotong University and transferred to Jiangxi Province. Since 1978, ECJTU and Shanghai Railway Institute ran independently as two universities and then was affiliated to the Railway Ministry of China. In 2000, the university was reformed to be \\"co-sponsored by both central and provincial governments, but mainly under the administration of the latter\\". Through many years' unremitting efforts, under priority construction in Jiangxi Province, ECJTU has grown into a provincially key university and one nationally accredited institution offering doctoral degree programs. ECJTU is located in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, China, a city where the People's Liberation Army was born and \\"the August 1st Spirit\\" appeared. Nestling near a mountain and besides a river, with a few lakes dotted inside, the campus is a wonderful place for teaching, learning and living, with birds chorusing, flowers blooming and trees exuberantly creating a landscape. ECJTU covers an area of nearly 3000 mu (200 hectares), the area of buildings of all kinds exceeds 700,000 square meters in total, and the value of equipment for teaching and scientific research amounts to 350 million Yuan.

It was also accredited to confer the following professional postgraduate degrees: Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Engineering, Master of Applied Statistics, Master of Accounting, Master of Physical Education and Master of Translation and Interpreting (MTI). Also, ECJTU is qualified to recommend graduates to study for master's degree without taking examinations. At present, the university has more than 23,000 registered students, 1700 staff and faculty members, including more than 530 professors and associate professors. The university boasts over 80 members respectively nominated or selected as candidates of \\"the New Century Hundred, Thousand and Ten-Thousand Talent Project\\" and \\"National Excellent Teachers\\" at the state level, \\"the Program for New Century Excellent Talents\\" of the Ministry of Education, \\"Young and Middle-aged Leading Talents in Science Technology\\" of the Ministry of Science and Technology, talents enjoying special allowance of the State Council, and provincially distinguished professors of \\"Jingangshan Scholars\\" , etc. ECJTU has always been undertaking talents cultivation as the fundamental task, forming an integrated talent cultivation system covering bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees. In 2015, the university carried out a reform and practice in terms of cultivating an interactive network of comprehensive talents at the basic level, which wins the Second Class Prize of the National Level Teaching Achievement Award. Meanwhile, its national defense students‚Äô cultivation mode is approved as National Experimental Zones for Innovating Talents Cultivation, which is popularized by the Ministry of Education and the General Political Department across the universities nationwide. ECJTU takes the lead in China in exploring and practicing a five-year, double-major interdisciplinary talents cultivation mode as \\"musicology plus secretary\\". It also has \\"Software engineering plus application background majors\\", along with the establishment of a scientific and technological business incubation garden for college students, was also the first bold try in Jiangxi province, which realized an effective interaction between talents cultivation and employment supply and demand. In 2015, ECJTU takes the lead in reform and started to apply academic credit system in all majors. The university maintains a high social recognition for its high-quality talents, and a leading graduate employment rate which has topped the list in Jiangxi Province for 10 successive years. The outstanding performance in graduate employment work wins ECJTU the title of Advanced Unit in Graduate Employment Work among ordinary universities nationwide, and also the award of the \\"Top 50 Universities in Employment\\", which enables the university to conduct admission in 26 provinces by an enrollment standard for the first batch universities in China. Aiming at talents cultivation quality, ECJTU will firstly carry out the complete credit system among the provincial universities in 2015. It has successfully cultivated a large number of outstanding graduates, such as Xu Gang, who was the first student in Jiangxi entitled the Chinese Excellent University Students of the Year, Zhang Hailong, the Chinese Model Students of Self- Improvement, and Ouyang Zili, the National Positive and Kind-Hearted Youth.

On the other hand, they did not understand what mechanisms actually drove biological diversity. They also did not understand how physical traits are inherited from one generation to the next. Blending inheritance was the common ideal at the time, but was later discredited by the experiments of Gregor Mendel. Mendel proposed the theory of particulate inheritance by using pea plants (Pisum sativum) to explain how variation can be inherited and maintained over time. = Blending model versus particulate model = * Blending model: ** Offspring are a blend of both parents (i.e. in modern terms, alleles would blend together to form a completely new allele) ** The characteristics of the blended offspring are passed on to the next generation ** Variation is washed out over time * Particulate model: ** Offspring are a combination of both parents ** The characteristics of both parents are passed on to the next generation as separate entities ** Variation is maintained over time  Mendel's methods  Mendel's laws = Since Mendel used experimental methods to devise his particulate inheritance theory, he developed three basic laws of inheritance: the Law of Segregation, the Law of Independent Assortment, and the Law of Dominance:  Law of segregation  Mendel's experiment with tall and short pea plants demonstrates how each individual plant has two particles called alleles. When a pea plant produces gametes (reproductive cells), it segregates one allele to each one.  Law of independent assortment  The law states that when the parents differ from each other in two or more pairs of contrasting characters, the inheritance of one pair of characters is independent to that of the other pair of characters.  Law of dominance  In the pea plants, Mendel observed that the \\"T\\" allele (dominant) masked the effects of the \\"t\\" allele (recessive). The terms \\"dominant\\" and \\"recessive\\" are used for the masking and the covered allele, respectively. All offspring from this cross are heterozygotes in terms of their genotypes. They also are tall (because the allele for tall masks the allele for short) in terms of their \\"phenotype\\".  Fisher  In a 1918 publication titled \\"The Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance Among Close Relatives,\\" R.A. Fisher showed that particulate inheritance was capable of generating the vast amount of variation we see among closely related individuals. This helped to reconcile the Biometric and Mendelian schools of thought at the time, and was an important step in the modern synthesis.  Notes  References  * Campbell, N. E. & Reece, J. B. (2002).

Since no male issue followed her, the king appointed tutors for the princess who trained her how to rule the Kingdom and defend it from the enemies that had sacked Mansura. Dodo-I ruled Sindh for 15 years. During this period of his rule, a son was born to him whom he named Shahabuddin Sanghar. While Sanghar Soomro was still a minor, Dodo-I abdicated the throne in 1092 AD in favor of his daughter Zainab, to live a retired life. Since the Prince Shahabuddin Sanghar was a minor, the Council of Ministers and Sardars unanimously followed the wishes of their Monarch and crowned Sanghar‚Äôs sister Zainab as the sovereign Queen of Sindh. During the reign of Zainab, no foreign armies invaded Sindh, the capital city Tharri expanded, and trade with foreign countries increased. After the tenth year of her rule, under rule of succession she declared Sanghar as the king of Sindh. Consequently, Sanghar was crowned as the Sovereign King of Sindh and Queen Tari retired to lead a family life.  Sources  * Chronological dictionary of Sindh by M.H.

The goal of inline caching is to speed up runtime method binding by remembering the results of a previous method lookup directly at the call site. Inline caching is especially useful for dynamically typed languages where most if not all method binding happens at runtime and where virtual method tables often cannot be used.  Runtime method binding  The following ECMAScript function receives an object, invokes its toString-method and displays the results on the page the script is embedded in. function dump(obj) { document.write(obj.toString()); } Since the type of the object is not specified and because of potential method overloading, it is impossible to decide ahead of time which concrete implementation of the toString-method is going to be invoked. Instead, a dynamic lookup has to be performed at runtime. In language runtimes that do not employ some form of caching, this lookup is performed every time a method is invoked. Because methods may be defined several steps down the inheritance chain, a dynamic lookup can be an expensive operation. To achieve better performance, many language runtimes employ some form of non-inline caching where the results of a limited number of method lookups are stored in an associative data structure. This can greatly increase performance, provided that the programs executed are \\"cache friendly\\" (i.e. there is a limited set of methods that are invoked frequently). This data structure is typically called the first-level method lookup cache.  Inline caching  The concept of inline caching is based on the empirical observation that the objects that occur at a particular call site are often of the same type. In those cases, performance can be increased greatly by storing the result of a method lookup \\"inline\\", i.e. directly at the call site. To facilitate this process, call sites are assigned different states. Initially, a call site is considered to be \\"uninitialized\\". Once the language runtime reaches a particular uninitialized call site, it performs the dynamic lookup, stores the result at the call site and changes its state to \\"monomorphic\\". If the language runtime reaches the same call site again, it retrieves the callee from it and invokes it directly without performing any more lookups. To account for the possibility that objects of different types may occur at the same call site, the language runtime also has to insert guard conditions into the code. Most commonly, these are inserted into the preamble of the callee rather than at the call site to better exploit branch prediction and to save space due to one copy in the preamble versus multiple copies at each call site. If a call site that is in the \\"monomorphic\\" state encounters a type other than the one it expects, it has to change back to the \\"uninitialized\\" state and perform a full dynamic lookup again. The canonical implementation L. Peter Deutsch, Allan M. Schiffman, \\"Efficient implementation of the smalltalk-80 system\\", POPL '84: Proceedings of the 11th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN symposium on Principles of programming languages, January 1984 is a register load of a constant followed by a call instruction. The \\"uninitialized\\" state is better called \\"unlinked\\". The register is loaded with the message selector (typically the address of some object) and the call is to the run-time routine that will look-up the message in the class of the current receiver, using the first-level method lookup cache above. The run-time routine then rewrites the instructions, changing the load instruction to load the register with the type of the current receiver, and the call instruction to call the preamble of the target method, now \\"linking\\" the call site to the target method. Execution then continues immediately following the preamble. A subsequent execution will call the preamble directly. The preamble then derives the type of the current receiver and compares it with that in the register; if they agree the receiver is of the same type and the method continues to execute. If not, the preamble again calls the run-time and various strategies are possible, one being to relink the call-site for the new receiver type. The performance gains come from having to do one type comparison, instead of at least a type comparison and a selector comparison for the first-level method lookup cache, and from using a direct call (which will benefit from instruction prefetch and pipe- lining) as opposed to the indirect call in a method-lookup or a vtable dispatch.  Monomorphic inline caching  If a particular call site frequently sees different types of objects, the performance benefits of inline caching can easily be nullified by the overhead induced by the frequent changes in state of the call site. The following example constitutes a worst- case scenario for monomorphic inline caching: var values = [1, \\"a\\", 2, \\"b\\", 3, \\"c\\", 4, \\"d\\"]; for (var i in values) { document.write(values[i].toString()); } Again, the method toString is invoked on an object whose type is not known in advance. More importantly though, the type of the object changes with every iteration of the surrounding loop. A naive implementation of monomorphic inline caching would therefore constantly cycle through the \\"uninitialized\\" and \\"monomorphic\\" states. In order to prevent this from happening, most implementations of monomorphic inline caching support a third state often referred to as the \\"megamorphic\\" state. This state is entered when a particular call site has seen a predetermined number of different types. Once a call site has entered the \\"megamorphic\\" state, it will behave just as it did in the \\"uninitialized\\" state with the exception that it will not enter the \\"monomorphic\\" state ever again (some implementations of monomorphic inline caching will change \\"megamorphic\\" call sites back to being \\"uninitialized\\" after a certain amount of time has passed or once a full garbage collection cycle is performed).  Polymorphic inline caching  To better deal with call sites that frequently see a limited number of different types, some language runtimes employ a technique called polymorphic inline caching.H√∂lzle, U., Chambers, C., AND Ungar, D. 1991. Optimizing dynamically-typed object-oriented languages with polymorphic inline caches. In Proceedings of the ECOOP ‚Äô91 Conference. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 512. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. With polymorphic inline caching, once a call site that is in its \\"monomorphic\\" state sees its second type, rather than reverting to the \\"uninitialized\\" state it switches to a new state called \\"polymorphic\\". A \\"polymorphic\\" call site decides which of a limited set of known methods to invoke based on the type that it is currently presented with. In other words, with polymorphic inline caching, multiple method lookup results can be recorded at the same call site. Because every call site in a program can potentially see every type in the system, there usually is an upper bound to how many lookup results are recorded at each call site. Once that upper bound is reached, call sites become \\"megamorphic\\" and no more inline caching is performed. The canonical implementation is a jump table which consists of a preamble that derives the type of the receiver and a series of constant compares and conditional jumps that jump to the code following the preamble in the relevant method for each receiver type. The jump table is typically allocated for a particular call-site when a monomorphic call-site encounters a different type. The jump-table will have a fixed size and be able to grow, adding cases as new types are encountered up to some small maximum number of cases such as 4, 6 or 8. Once it reaches its maximum size execution for a new receiver type will \\"fall-off\\" the end and enter the run-time, typically to perform a method lookup starting with the first-level method cache. The observation that together, monomorphic and polymorphic inline caches collect per-call-site receiver type information as a side-effect of optimizing program execution led to the development of adaptive optimization in Self, where the run-time optimizes \\"hot spots\\" in the program using the type information in inline caches to guide speculative inlining decisions.  Megamorphic inline caching  If a run-time uses both monomorphic and polymorphic inline caching then in the steady state the only unlinked sends occurring will be those from sends falling-off the ends of polymorphic inline caches. Since such sends are slow it can now be profitable to optimize these sites. A megamorphic inline cache can be implemented by creating code to perform a first-level method lookup for a particular call-site. In this scheme once a send falls-off the end of a polymorphic inline cache a megamorphic cache specific to the call site's selector is created (or shared if one already exists), and the send site is relinked to call it. The code can be significantly more efficient than a normal first-level method lookup probe since the selector is now a constant, which decreases register pressure, the code for the lookup and dispatch is executed without calling into the run-time, and the dispatch can benefit from branch prediction. Empirical measurements PICs [was v8 first impressions] on the Strongtalk mailing list show that in large Smalltalk programs about 1/3 of all send sites in active methods remain unlinked, and of the remaining 2/3, 90% are monomorphic, 9% polymorphic and 1% (0.9%) are megamorphic.

The highest peak is at 1,525 m above sea level. The Monte Nerone is a limestone massif, including several aspects of Karst topography. The core of the mountain is formed by an oncoidal limestone reef covered by successive pelagic carbonate deposits including ammonite beds. The mountains in this area have been caught up in a period of compressional tectonics causing folding and distinct high topographic ridges. Origins of the name are unclear; it has been suggested it could stem from that of the Roman consul Gaius Claudius Nero, who, in the battle of the Metaurus against the Carthaginians led by Hasdrubal, pursued the Gauls up to the mountain's peak.

Biography Born in Hamburg, West Germany, Weber started taking piano lessons aged ten, in 1963. His sister introduced him to the blues by giving him records of Lightnin' Hopkins, Michael Pewny, Champion Jack Dupree, Taj Mahal and many others. At the age of sixteen he played in bars in the harbour of his hometown Hamburg, where he met Hans-Georg M√∂ller, another pianist, who introduced him to the boogie-woogie style of playing piano. There he also met the comedian Otto Waalkes, who booked him as opener for his then-current tour. In 1975 he released his first album, The Boogie Man on Otto Waalkes' R√ºssl R√§ckords, which was awarded 'Deutscher Schallplattenpreis 1976'. This album was partly recorded in the 'Fabrik', where he has had a regular gig once a month since 1976. In 1978 he traveled to the United States for the first time. In 1980 he became disc jockey at the local NDR radio station, where he hosted a weekly Blues broadcast. He played with Big Joe Williams, Abi Wallenstein, Henry Heggen, Axel Zwingenberger, Jay McShann, James Booker, Chuck Berry and Champion Jack Dupree at music festivals and in clubs all over Germany. Due to illness, Vince Weber reduced his stage activities in later years. He died on February 23, 2020, aged 66.Axel Zwingerberger, \\"R.I.P. Vince Weber\\", BoogieWoogie.net.

Referred to as Turku Observatory () by the Minor Planet Center, it was previously operated by the University of Turku from 1937 to 1972, and is the observatory where several Finnish discoverers of minor planets made their observations.  History  The observatory was originally owned by the department of astronomy of the University of Turku. It was built in 1935 and 1936, and technically designed by physics and astronomy professor Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§. V√§is√§l√§'s research team discovered a total of 807 minor planets and 7 comets at the observatory. V√§is√§l√§ also contributed significantly to research in the areas of optics and surveying. As the city expanded and a steel factory was built under a kilometer away from the observatory, the astronomy department of the university moved to Tuorla Observatory in the 1950s. In the 1960s, an apartment building area was built in Iso-Heikkil√§, preventing any observations of low-sky objects in all directions except north. Iso-Heikkil√§ remained in the use of students for some time, until the university gave up its ownership completely in 1972. The observatory building and the site are now owned by the city of Turku. The observatory is currently operated by Turun Ursa ry, an astronomical association founded by Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§ in 1928. The association arranged in V√§is√§l√§'s time and continues to arrange stargazing events for the general public at the observatory. The members use the observatory, as well as the Kevola Observatory, for amateur astronomical observations. Instruments and facilities The observatory has two 6-meter domes in the East-West direction. The main instruments of the association are located in the western dome: the 15 and 13 centimeter telescopes made by Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§ and a 19 cm Schmidt-V√§is√§l√§ camera. In the past, the dome has housed a 50 centimeter wide-angle camera which is nowadays located in the Kevola Observatory ‚Äì it was the telescope used to discover the aforementioned minor planets and comets.  Standard baseline  In the forest further away from the observatory, about to the northeast, is a concrete pillar used by Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§ in the 1940s in his baseline measurements. The V√§is√§l√§ comparator has been used in important baseline measurements around the world. Another pillar that remains today is located to the southwest from the previous one, in a forest across the railway.

It premiered on December 14, 1924, in a private performance at the Metropolitan Opera House as part of a \\"Lambs Gambol\\", a meeting of the Lambs Club, a theatrical club in New York City. About 700 invited guests attended, including Will Rogers. It was first performed for the public in a radio performance on January 20, 1933. Never published, its manuscript full score, vocal score, and orchestral parts are all in the collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, at Lincoln Center in New York City. The original working title of the opera was Knights of the Hemp. Story The setting of the opera is a small Parisian tavern, in the dead of winter, during the 17th century. A group of torturers meet, and compare stories. The mistress of the tavern listens intently as one of the men recounts how, years ago, he'd tortured a young man. Just before the young man died, he'd promised his tormentor that one day he'd return from the grave to drag his soul to hell. Hearing the story, the mistress realizes that this cruel man had once been her lover‚Äîwho'd abandoned her, unaware that she was pregnant. She also realized to her horror, that the young man he was boasting about murdering had been their son. As members of this cruel brotherhood get up to leave, she entices her former love to remain for another drink with her. She secretly poisons his drink, and relates the part of his story that he did not know to him as he dies in agony. As he slumps to the floor, the tavern door swings violently open, and the shade of the dead youth arrives to claim the soul of his torturer.

It is a -story, center- passage brick house covered with gray stucco. The 30 foot by 20 foot, stone grist mill is built into a river bank and is two to three stories high. Both structures were built about 1750. Since the end of World War I when the property was acquired by the Federal government, Perry Point has been used as a rehabilitation center, a supply depot, and a psychiatric hospital, the latter use surviving and expanding to the present. The Perry Point Mansion House and Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places during 1975. As of 1/1/2014 GSA as the agent for the VA is seeking a contractor to renovate the Mansion House and Grist Mill. Perry Point VA Medical Center - History The first inhabitants of the Perry Point peninsula were the giant Susquehannock Indians. Many arrow heads and other relics of the tribe can still be found throughout the Point to attest to their long occupation of the area. In approximately 1680, Lord Baltimore made a grant of 32,000 acres of land, designated as Susquehanna Manor, to his cousin George Talbot. A part of the grant included Susquehanna Point, the first name given to the peninsula. When Talbot was appointed Surveyor General of the grant to promote settlements on the land, he found that John Bateman was already established on the Point. Bateman had acquired the land in 1658 by a patent from Lord Baltimore. In 1710, Captain Richard Perry acquired the land. Although the name ‚ÄúPerry Point‚Äù has been ascribed to Captain Richard Perry, the original grant to John Bateman refers to the tract as ‚ÄúPerry Point,‚Äù thus proving that the change from ‚ÄúSusquehanna Point‚Äù occurred earlier than 1658. Between the time that John Bateman owned the property and when it was purchased by Captain Perry, the records do not show the names of the owners. Relatives of George Talbot resided for a time on the Point and may have owned it during this time period. In 1728, Perry Point was owned by John Perry, George Perry, Anna Templer and Dorothy Barren. In 1729, Philip Thomas became the owner of the property, leaving it by will to his son Samuel Thomas in 1763, who in turn willed it to his son Richard Thomas in 1784. It was during the Thomas family ownership of the Point that the Mansion House was constructed around 1750 from bricks brought over as ballast on ships from England. The Grist Mill, which was built around the same period as the Mansion House, indicates that there was a settlement of considerable size on the Point. In 1798, John Homes‚Äô name appears on the records as the owner of Perry Point, followed by Littleton Gale in 1799 and George Gale on October 11, 1800. On October 13, 1800, John Stump purchased Perry Point, which presumably included an estate of approximately 1,800 acres. It was during the residence of John Stump that the British came up the Chesapeake Bay in the War of 1812, burned Havre de Grace, and continued their destruction as far up as Lapidum, where they burned a grist mill owned by John Stump's cousin. They returned down the river and marched to Principio, where they burned the Iron Works. For some unknown reason, they spared the Mansion House and Grist Mill at Perry Point. John Stump died in 1828, leaving Perry Point to his son John Stump II. During the Civil War, the United States Government took over Perry Point for the first time, using it as a training station for cavalry mules. The officers in charge of the project used the Mansion House for their headquarters, sharing it for a time with the Stump family. When the situation became too strained for comfort, John Stump II moved his family to Harford County to live with his sister. Upon their return, they found the Mansion House badly abused and the farm sadly neglected, but many of the former slaves remained voluntarily as hired workers and the usual activities resumed. In 1848, an agreement was drawn up between John Stump II and the promoters of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (a branch of the Pennsylvania system) for the right of way through the Stump farm. Due to great difficulties in the construction process, the road was not completed until about 1954. In 1898, John Stump II died, leavening his estate to his 10 children: Mary Smith, Judge Frederick Stump, Henrietta Mitchell, Anna Webster, John Stump, Katherine Magraw, Dr. George M. Stump, Elizabeth Boswell, Alicia Stump and Judge Arthur H. Stump. Soon after the United States entered World War I on April 6, 1917, several representatives of the U.S. Government were sent out from Washington to inspect a number of locations for an ammonium nitrate plan. Because of its favorable location close to transportation facilities, Perry Point was selected. In February 1918, the U.S. Government purchased the 516-acre estate for $150,000 from the Stump heirs. The U.S. Government leased the Point to the Atlas Powder Company, which constructed a large ammonium nitrate plant and village of 300 homes to house its employees. The ground was broken for the construction of the plan on March 3, 1918. After only 124 days of constructions, the first unit of the plant started turning out ammonium nitrate on July 5, 1918, for use in high explosives. Soon after the completion of the plant and its village, the Armistice was signed and the manufacture of ammonium nitrate was no longer necessary. By Act of Congress, Perry Point was turned over to the U.S. Public Health Service on March 3, 1919, for the hospitalization of War Risk beneficiaries and as a storage depot for surplus hospital supplies for the Army. The first hospital building, a two-story structure located in the village, was converted to accommodate 75 patients. When the U.S. Public Health Service opened at Perry Point, the facility functioned as a general hospital that provided care for patients with various disabilities. In 1920, the U.S. Public Health Hospital in Cap May, New Jersey closed, the patients were transferred to Perry Point and four more of the buildings in the village were converted for hospital use. It was at this time that Perry Point became a hospital that focused on neuro-psychiatric care. The U.S. Veterans‚Äô Bureau took over Perry Point on May 1, 1922. That year the first permanent buildings, the five circle wards, were built. In 1923, the patient population at Perry Point grew substantially after several other hospital facilities closed and transferred their patients and staff to the facility. All activities on the campus were divided into four departments: Hospitalization, Supplies, Utilities and Rehabilitation. In 1923, officials at Perry Point decided to adopt the name ‚ÄúFederal Park‚Äù to indicate government ownership and operation. Representatives of the Stump family and other leading families in Cecil County petitioned the authorities in Washington, D.C., to restore the original name of the campus due to its historic significance. On June 30, 1924, the Government agreed to the change and ‚ÄúFederal Park‚Äù ceased to be and ‚ÄúPerry Point‚Äù came into its own again. On May 25, 1925, five additional hospital wards and a recreation building were completed to accommodate the additional patient population. In the years that followed, many additional hospital and administrative buildings were constructed throughout the campus to meet the needs of Perry Point's growing patient population. The Veterans Administration actually came into being in 1930 when President Hoover signed an Executive Order establishing the agency. On October 30, 1989, ground was broken for a new clinical addition at Perry Point that was constructed to provide primary care and specialty outpatient services. The new outpatient care facility, which is attached to building 23H, was designed and constructed to better meet the needs of Veterans by offering the latest medical technology, expanded clinical space and comfortable waiting areas and exam rooms. In October 1995, the Perry Point VA Medical Center integrated under a single management structure with the Baltimore and Fort Howard VA Medical Centers and the Baltimore VA Rehabilitation & Extended Care Center to form the VA Maryland Health Care System. On June 20, 2000, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs approved the plans to change the mission of the Fort Howard VA Medical Center. The mission change was requested to address the numerous structural deficiencies within the facility's main hospital building, as well as the continuing shift nationally from inpatient to outpatient care. The plans for the approved mission change included shifting inpatient programs and administrative functions from Fort Howard to other VA shifting inpatient programs and administrative functions from Fort Howard to other VA Maryland Health Care System facilities. The first phase of the mission change was completed in September 2002, with the relocation of Fort Howard's inpatient programs and administrative functions to the Baltimore VA Rehabilitation & Extended Care Center and the Perry Point VA Medical Center. On April 7, 1998, a new inpatient mental health care building was dedicated at Perry Point. The new facility (building 364), which was Perry Point's first new inpatient building constructed in over 50 years, was built to offer specialized treatment programs, rehabilitation services and enhanced patient privacy for Veterans in a comfortable, state-of-the-art setting. To better serve the needs of outpatients requiring mental health care services, a new 5,600 square foot Partial Hospitalization Program replacement building was constructed at Perry Point and dedicated on September 20, 2004. This new facility, which is attached to the outpatient mental health clinic (Building 80H), provides a structured treatment program to assist Veteran patients transition back into the community and to prevent future hospitalization. The new facility is a replacement for the old Day Treatment Center (Building 10H), which was originally constructed in 1924. Today, the Perry Point VA Medical Center has been serving the health care needs of U.S. Veterans for more than 80 years. There are currently over 85 buildings dispersed throughout the 397-acre campus, with several of the buildings constructed by the Atlas Powder Company still in active use. In 1975, the historic significance of the Mansion House and Grist Mill was recognized when the two structures were placed on the prestigious National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior. These two buildings are the oldest known structures in the entire VA system.

History A train station called \\"Childs Station\\" opened in 1886 on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line. Until 1949, passenger trains stopped at Childs, but during ts last few years the station only handled freight, most of it going to and from the Elk Paper Company. In 1893, the Lancaster, Cecil, & Southern Railroad opened a 4-1/2 mile spur from Childs to Providence, this road bringing freight rail service to a cluster of manufacturers on the Little Elk Creek. In May 1972, the B & O, which had acquired the line many years earlier, gave notice that it was completely abandoning the branch, which had seen declining service for decades as industries along the creek closed. The Childs Post Office was established in 1887, and has been housed in at least three locations since that time. The ZIP code is 21916. The Post Office is currently located on Blue Ball Road, just north of the intersection of Childs and Blue Ball Road. At one time it was housed in the Old Childs Store, located at the northwest corner of what is now Childs, Star Route and Blue Ball Roads.http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/007000/007000/007005/pdf/msa_se5_7005.pdf The Old Childs Store is now an antique and art store.

A forgery of the first day of issue bearing a Childs postmark can be found on display at the Smithsonian. The Cecil County Poorhouse was located just outside of Childs when the county purchased about 174 acres of land adjacent to the village from Henry Hollingsworth in 1788. Paupers, the elderly, sick, and mentally ill, people with nowhere else to turn, were cared for here until 1952. That year, the old county farm property was put up for sale. It was purchased by Elk Paper Manufacturing Company of Childs, the new owner donating part of the tract to the Oblate Sisters of Mt. Aviat Academy. The potter's field, the final resting place for paupers who couldn't afford a burial, is located across the road from Mt. Aviat Academy. It was used as the county cemetery until 1950, and there are from this period some 150 to 200 unmarked graves. There is a stone on the southern side of Childs Road that notes the location and dates of active use of the burial ground. The Potter's Field was also the site of a public execution in 1879.Mike Dixon, A Place of Need, Cecil Soil Magazine (July/Aug. 2011),available at http://www.bluetoad.com/article/A+Look+Back+With+Dixon%3A+Mike+Dixon/829998/0/article.html. Culture The Oblates of St. Francis de Sales have a facility in Childs which includes the Shrine of our Lady of the Highways, visible from Interstate 95. Early one foggy morning in October 1968 as seminarians, priests, and brothers were starting their early morning routine, they heard crash and crash on I-95. A swath of almost impenetrable fog had settled in this stretch of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway where it crosses the Little Elk Creek at Childs. As cars hit the dense fog, drivers slammed on the brakes, triggering a chain reaction as 20 vehicles quickly piled up. The first urgent call for emergency services came in at 6:20 a..m. from the Oblates. While they waited for fire and rescue services, seminarians and priests comforted the injured and dying. Three people died that morning before the sun came up. The young novitiates and seminarians were so moved by their experience as they waited for rescue units to make their way through the dense autumn fog that they erected a shrine in 1973, dedicating it to the memory of three people who died in the accident.Katie Moose, Maryland's Western Shore: The Guidebook 51 (2001).http://www.oblates.org/development/prayer_ministry/lady_of_highways.php .

Ellen Maria Stone The Miss Stone Affair (, ) was the kidnapping of American Protestant missionary Ellen Maria Stone and her pregnant Bulgarian fellow missionary and friend Katerina Cilka by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization.Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer eds., History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries, Volume 2, John Benjamins Publishing, 2006, , p. 361. History In 1901, one of the main problems facing the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization was the lack of resources for armaments. This financial crisis was discussed at the meeting of the leadership of IMRO in Kyustendil, Bulgaria that summer. At this meeting, Delchev argued that small robberies only tarnished the reputation of the organization and were not helpful to solving the financial problem. Gotse Delchev then authorized Mihail Gerdzhikov to carry out the kidnapping of a wealthy person or persons in Macedonia to obtain funds, but he failed. Delchev made two other unsuccessful attempts with wealthy Turks and Greeks. He later developed a plan to kidnap the son of Ivan Evstratiev Geshov, which also failed. Sandanski then offered to kidnap Ferdinand of Bulgaria during his visit to the Rila Monastery, but this radical plan was opposed by Delchev, who believed that the abduction must be done on Ottoman territory. Chernopeev and Sandanski discussed the kidnapping of a wealthy Turk near Simitli, but this plan was not realised. Yane Sandanski, Hristo Chernopeev and Sava Mihaylov prepared a plan for the kidnapping of S√ºleyman Bey, but due to his illness this action also failed. Sandanski was then drawn to the idea of kidnapping a Protestant missionary of Bansko. A detachment led by the voivoda Yane Sandanski and the sub-voivodas Hristo Chernopeev and Kr«éstyo Asenov carried this out on August 21st, 1901. Two women‚ÄîEllen Maria Stone and her fellow missionary Katerina Stefanova-Cilka‚Äîwere kidnapped somewhere between Bansko and Gorna Dzhumaya, then towns in the Ottoman Empire. The goal of the kidnapping was to receive a heavy ransom and aid the financially struggling IMRO. The detachment was pursued by the Ottoman and Bulgarian authorities and by a cheta of the contending organization Supreme Macedonian Committee. Ottoman authorities for a short time, arrested Grigor Cilka, husband of Katerina on unfounded charges of being complicit in the kidnapping. Sometimes regarded as a case of the Stockholm syndrome (with the kidnappers even assisting Cilka in giving birth to her daughter), the affair ended after intensive negotiations in early 1902, half a year after the kidnapping. IMRO was paid a ransom of 14,000 Turkish gold liras on January 18th, 1902 in Bansko, and the hostages were released on February 2nd near Strumica. Widely covered by the media at the time, the event has been often dubbed \\"America's first modern hostage crisis\\". ReferencesFurther reading  * Some archive photos concerning the case.

Format  Each simulator comprises a black-coloured horse (the Riding simulator is coloured bay, with no legs and real horse mane and tail. They also come equipped with reins with the user only needing to supply his/her own saddle and stirrups. The simulators are controlled two different ways. The instructor mode is by pressing buttons on the side of the simulators to start, speed up, slow down or stop the horse whilst the rider mode is aid sensitive in the form of squeezing his/her leg on a side sensor panel to start the ride and squeezing again to speed up. To slow down or stop, the rider has to pull the reins. Some simulators come with equipment for use of a western saddle, a TV screen to simulate the ride and even a coin box operation. They even use a soundtrack to simulate horse sounds during the ride.  Use in popular life  Racewood simulators can be regularly seen in riding schools and some gyms and tack shops across the UK. They are also sometimes brought in to horse expeditions and shows such as the Grand National, Horse Of The Year Show and the Badminton Horse Trials. A popular nationwide festival, The National Riding Festival, also uses a Racewood cantering simulator called \\"Trigger\\", who appears at every date on the festival tour and at some primary and secondary schools to encourage children to take up horse riding.

Madison's term describes expatriates (voluntary emigrants) who supposedly have an \\"existential\\" motivation, unlike economic migration, simple wanderlust, exile, or variations of forced migration. ‚ÄòExistential migration‚Äô is conceived as a chosen attempt to express something fundamental about existence by leaving one‚Äôs homeland and becoming a foreigner.  Research  As well as the new concept of existential migration, the research proposed a novel definition of home as interaction; that the ‚Äòfeeling of home‚Äô arises from specific interactions with our surroundings that could potentially occur anywhere, at any time. This is in contrast to the usual definition of home as a fixed geographical place. The new concept also challenges our usual definitions of being at home, the experience of foreignness, what constitutes belonging, and the nature of homelessness. The insights gained from this new concept elaborate our existing understanding of migration in exciting ways. Existential migration suggests reformulations of the psychological underpinnings of migration studies, cultural anthropology, tourism studies, cross-cultural training, refugee studies, and psychotherapy. Madison's research presents its subject matter in a clear and evocative way, emphasising the actual stories of voluntary migrants in order to convey the poignancy of the topic. The phenomenological research that gave rise to the concept of existential migration (Madison, 2006) also suggests a cautionary note regarding the psychological impact of increasing globalisation. While globalisation is frequently presented as an economic evolution of capitalism and as a market necessity, there is scant discourse about the impact that these profound changes in world structure may have upon the experience of people in their daily lives. Although the phenomenological research on voluntary migration needs further critique, the first research does suggest that the world community may in fact be entering an age of global homelessness. Of course recent economic turbulence has curtailed the increasing expectation that young professionals should be prepared to live abroad in order to enhance their career prospects and indeed many, especially in the financial sector, are unexpectedly returning home after foreign assignments. However, even these returns home are often more problematic than expected and rather than return, they seem to resemble yet another migration due to the subsequent changes in person and home environment since the original leaving. The concept of existential migration has generated considerable comment from voluntary migrants around the world as well as psychological and social science researchers, though there remains precious little in print about these fundamental existential motivations for migration. The concept has commonalities with some of the work on cosmopolitanism by the anthropologist Nigel Rapport. A book on the subject, entitled The End of Belonging, is available publicly. The research is increasingly cited by new international researchers and artists exploring the experience of voluntary migration.

Andy Warhol produced at least four notable Coca-Cola paintings in the 1960s, with Green Coca-Cola Bottles being one of them. As part of the same series, Warhol created Coca- Cola (3), among others. Origin & painting Warhol created a number of notable works in the early 1960s. This began with the famous Campbell's Soup Cans, which was completed between 1961 and early 1962. During this period, Warhol experimented with numerous common items, before creating the Green Coca-Cola Bottles painting in 1962. This period is often referred back to as Warhol's earlier work. In his early days as an artist, Warhol apparently experimented with the Coca-Cola bottle beginning in the 1950s. The first known artwork of Warhol's was an ink-on-gouache drawing of a Coca-Cola bottle with a pair of legs. In the early 1960s, prior to the creation of Campbell's Soup Cans, he used to tear Coca-Cola bottle images from magazines to use them in collages. This inspiration and early use of the Coca-Cola bottle led him to create Green Coca-Cola Bottles in 1962. Green Coca-Cola Bottles took a mainstream item and converted it into a piece of art. Warhol‚Äôs piece utilized a silkscreen technique, which mechanicalized some aspects of the painting but featured individualized ‚Äúunevenness‚Äù across the painting. The painting engenders an optimistic message for the American public, described in Warhol‚Äôs own words, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs grand about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same thing as the poorest... you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and, just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke.‚ÄùFred S. Kleiner. Gardner's Art Through the Ages. Cengage, 2008. 984. Early Coca-Cola painting series Andy Warhol's relationship with Coca-Cola began early in his career when he created a number Coca-Cola themed paintings. One such work was the creation of Green Coca-Cola Bottles, which was part of a wider series of four paintings. According to a friend of Warhol's, he began to focus on pop art paintings of Coca-Cola bottles and asked for critique on them. \\"It wasn't until he did the series of Coke bottles and got the feedback ... that he found his genre.\\" Warhol also famously created Coca-Cola (3), which sold recently for a large sum at Christie's. Throughout his career, he created 15 artworks related to Coca-Cola, according to the corporation. Exhibitions Green Coca-Cola Bottles was exhibited at Coca-Cola's An American Icon At 100, celebrating the Coke bottle's 100th year since it was created. it is currently housed in New York City at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

It was originally raised in 1940 as an armoured cavalry unit as part of the 8th Division, before being transferred to the 9th Division. Between 1941 and 1942 the regiment saw action in the Middle East before being returned to Australia in early 1943. At this time the regiment was re-organised as the administrative headquarters for the 2/4th, 2/11th and 2/12th Commando Squadrons and it was converted into a commando regiment. Later in 1945 the unit saw action during the landings on Tarakan on Borneo before being disbanded upon the cessation of hostilities. HistoryFormation= The 2/9th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment was formed in July 1940 at Seymour, Victoria as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force of the Australian Army. Initially, it was designated the \\"8th Division Cavalry Regiment\\"; however, it was redesignated as the \\"9th Division Cavalry Regiment\\" in February 1941 when the 8th Division was sent to Malaya without its armoured elements, which were subsequently transferred to the 9th Division. =Service in the Middle East= Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hector Bastin, training was completed at the Armoured Vehicles Fighting School, before along with the rest of the 9th Division, the regiment was sent to the Middle East, arriving in Egypt in April 1941. Equipped with Vickers light tanks and Bren carriers, the regiment then saw action in Syria where it supported the 7th Division. During this time the regiment's squadrons were detached at brigade level with 'A' Squadron being placed under the operational command of the 21st Brigade near Saida, while 'C' Squadron was allocated to the 25th Brigade, utilising a number of captured Vichy French Renault R35 tanks. After this the regiment was re- equipped, receiving Crusader and Stuart tanks to replace the Vickers and captured French tanks that they had previously been using. This had been done as a response to the increased threat posed by German armour in the theatre. In July 1942, the 9th Division was sent to help rectify the situation at El Alamein, where German and Italian troops were attacking. The 9th Division Cavalry Regiment was involved in the defence of the Alamein line during this phase, defending the divisional headquarters and supporting the defending infantry units in small scale raids. In October 1942, when the Allies launched an offensive, the regiment initially played only a minor part but later, after breakout had been achieved, it came into its own and led the Allied advance along the coastal plain, pursuing the withdrawing German and Italian forces and advancing over on 3 November alone. During the battle, Lieutenant Colonel William Muntz, who had previously served in the 7th Divisional Cavalry Regiment, took command of the regiment after Bastin fell sick, assuming command on 20 October 1942. Casualties during the regiment's involvement in the Middle East amounted to six killed in action, six died of wounds and one died of other causes. Its personnel received the following decorations for service during this time: one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, three Military Crosses, seven Military Medals, and 27 Mentions in Despatches. =Service in the Pacific= Members of the Australian 2/4th Commando Squadron on Tarakan Island in June 1945 In early 1943, the regiment was returned to Australia where, in April, it began to reorganise on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland in preparation for jungle fighting against the Japanese. At this time the Australian Army was undergoing a period of restructuring as its strategic focus shifted towards concentrating upon fighting the war against the Japanese in the Pacific. As a part of this there was no need for divisional cavalry regiments; however, it was decided that the independent companies should be grouped together under a regimental structure, and in response the divisional cavalry regiments were broken up and their headquarters elements were used to administer the commando squadrons. Three such units were formed at this time, with the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment adopting the title of the \\"2/9th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment\\" in January 1944. The subordinate squadrons that were attached to it were the 2/4th, 2/11th and 2/12th Commando Squadrons. Following this the regiment continued to undertake training on the Atherton Tablelands in preparation for operations in the Southwest Pacific. In the end, however, it was over a year before the regiment saw action again, taking part in the landings at Tarakan, and in northern Borneo in mid-1945 in one of the final campaigns of the war. During this campaign, the regiment's three squadrons were detached separately. The 2/4th was attached to the 26th Brigade, and saw heavy fighting on Tarakan, suffering a considerable number of casualties. The 2/11th was attached to the 24th Brigade and landed on Labuan Island off the northwest coast of Borneo. After clearing the island, they were transferred to the mainland and helped clear the Klias Peninsula. The 2/12th, however, was initially held back in divisional reserve, and as such did not take part in the main fighting on Labuan Island. As the Japanese resistance on the island was coming to an end and the focus of Australian operations moved towards the mainland of Borneo, the squadron was finally committed to operations when it was given the task of carrying out mopping up operations on the island. Commanding officers The 2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiment's Commanding Officers were as follows: * Lieutenant Colonel Hector Ernest Bastin; * Lieutenant Colonel William Norris Muntz. Battle honours The regiment received the following battle honours for their service during World War II: * North Africa 1942, Defence of Alamein Line, Tell el Eisa, Tell el Makh Khad, Sanyet el Miteirya, West Point 23, El Alamein, Syria 1941, Sidon, Wadi Zeini, Jebel Mazar, South-West Pacific 1945, Borneo, Labuan.

Biography Bagheri was born in 1957 in Tehran. He took his Ph. D degree from the University of New South Wales, Australia, in 1994. He is Professor of Philosophy of Education at the University of Tehran. He has made contributions to a wide range of topics in philosophy of education, Religion and personal construct psychology; topics from different viewpoints, such as constructive realism, neo-Pragmatism, action theory, deconstruction, Hermeneutics, and Islamic philosophy of education. In 2011 he was awarded First order Medal of Research (The Distinguished Researcher) by the University of Tehran.http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education Philosophical viewsReligious education= In his book Islamic Education he places human agency as the main educational thesis of Islam. This is while before him scholars such as Mutahari believed in human nature as the center of Islamic education. He opposes nature as a central key to Islamic education claiming that human beings are not a piece of non-living object to be fabricated into a human being. Instead human is a dynamic creature who should choose being religious. in this regard he has introduced abstinence by presence. While most scholars have insisted that religion is about preventing sinful situations Bagheri insists that real education leads to presence in a sinful situation and yet remaining intact.Bagheri Noaparast. \\"Islamic Education\\". Al-Hoda Publications, Tehran, 2001. =Personal construct theory= He argues that in George Kelly's personal construct psychology a combination of correspondence theory of truth and a coherence theory of truth is necessary. offering criteria for a reconciliation of correspondence and coherence theories he argues that constructivism should be based on a reality and the effort is to search for an optimal point where reality and constructs reach each other.Bagheri Noaparast. \\"Toward a More Realistic Constructivism\\". in \\"Advances in Personal Construct Psychology\\", vol. 3, pp. 37-59, Jai Press, 1995.Warren.\\"Philosophical dimensions of personal construct psychology\\".Vol. 4, Psychology Press, 1998.Neimeyer, R.A.\\"Limits and lessons of constructivism some critical reflections\\".

Either of these perspectives or a combination of them has led some to conclude that a science based on religion can lead to infallible knowledge. However, Bagheri argues that a religious science is only possible through interference of religious elements in the presupposition of a theory and hence will remain a science tout court, and its religious presuppositions will not guarantee an infallible knowledge.Bagheri Noaparast. \\"The Idea of a Religious Social Science\\".

The leaves are long, oblanceolate with a short petiole. The leaves, branches and stem are all covered in thick bristles. The inflorescences are wide and subtended by between 3 and 5 large ovate-cordate involucral bracts. These large bracts are the defining feature of the genus Helminthotheca. A number of infraspecific taxa are recognised, varying in their leaf shape. Distribution Helminthotheca echioides is native to the Mediterranean Basin, but has become widely naturalised outside that range. In the British Isles, it is widely distributed in the south and east, but more patchily distributed to the north and west. In Northern Ireland, H. echioides is only found on the north side of Belfast Lough. It has been introduced to North America, where it can now be found from Nova Scotia to British Columbia and California.

He played cricket for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship, making one appearance in 1901 against Northamptonshire and another in 1911, against Lincolnshire. At the 1924 general election, Preston was chosen as Conservative candidate for the Walsall constituency. He unseated the sitting Liberal MP, Patrick Collins. However, following his election, it was discovered that Preston had received payments for two small contracts to supply electrical fittings to the Post Office Stores Department. As a government contractor, Preston was ineligible to stand for parliament, and his election was declared void. Having overcome his legal difficulties, Preston was selected as Conservative candidate at the ensuing by-election. The poll was held on 27 February, and Preston was elected ahead of Liberal and Labour candidates, with a similar majority to that gained at the 1924 election. Preston was only a member of the House of Commons for one term. At the 1929 general election there was a swing to Labour, and he was defeated by the party's candidate John James McShane. He retired from politics. William Preston died after a long illness at his home, Gorway, Walsall in November 1941, aged 67.

It has been used as a filming location including for the TV series Wallander.  History  During the Middle Ages the residence was called Skurdorp (Skudrup), which was fortified and situated next to the parish church, where remains still can be seen. During the midst of the fifteenth century it was owned by guardsman Henning Meyenstorp (Meinstrup) and through marriage it later came to the possession of the Sparre-family. Approximately 1530 the residence was moved from Skurup to an islet in the Lake Svaneholmssj√∂n, after that it was called Svaneholm. Svaneholm Castle was initially erected in the 1530s by the Danish knight and royal advisor Mourids Jepsen Sparre (1480-1534). Through inheritance and purchase, in 1611 Svaneholm Castle came to the possession of Prebend Gyllenstierna (1656‚Äì1677). At the death of his great-grandson Axel Gyllenstierna in 1705, the castle went to the nephew Axel Julius Coyet (1692-1719) by testament, but 1723 his aunt Sofie Gyllenstierna gained half of the properties via trial. Her half was 1751 bought by baron Gustaf Julius Coyet (1717-1782). In 1782 it was inherited by Coyet's nephew, baron Rutger Maclean (1742-1816). Agricultural reforms introduced by Macklean became the law in Scania in 1803 and in the rest of Sweden in 1827. At Maclean's death in 1816, Svaneholm Castle was inherited by his nephew Kjell Christoffer Bennet and his three siblings, 1839 it was sold to chamberlain Carl Johan Hallenborg, and belonged to his son and grandchild until 1902 when it was redeemed by count Carl Augustin Ehrensv√§rd (1854‚Äì1934), who was married to Eva Augusta Hallenborg (1864-1947).  Today  A year after the death of Ehrensv√§rd in 1934, Svaneholm Castle, the park, the garden, most of the lake and the surrounding forest was purchased by the Svaneholm Castle Cooperative Society (). The castle now houses a museum run by Wemmenh√∂g Hundred's Monuments and Home District Society ().

In later life, she fled to Aragon, where she was known as Irene Lascaris.  Family  Eudoxia was the fourth daughter of the Nicaean emperor Theodore II Laskaris and of Elena Asenina of Bulgaria. Eudoxia grew up as a princess at the court of Nicaea, where Constance II of Hohenstaufen,Actas das II Jornadas Luso-Espanholas de Hist√≥ria Medieval: Porto, 1985 widow of her grandfather John III Doukas Vatatzes, also lived. As a young girl, Eudoxia was promised to the royal family of Aragon as a bride for their son, the future king Peter III of Aragon. After the Palaiologan usurpation of the imperial throne, both ladies (dowager empress Constance and Eudokia) fled, travelling the same route from Constantinople to Tende and Sicily, respectively, and, years later, both sought protection at the kingdom of Aragon under king James I.  Marriages and offspring  Soon after the re- conquest of Constantinople in 1261, Michael VIII Palaiologos, until then regent and co-emperor for the infant John IV Laskaris, had himself declared sole emperor, solidifying his position by having John IV blinded and imprisoned. John's three sisters, Eudoxia among them, were hurriedly married off to foreigners, so their descendants could not claim to the imperial succession. The young Eudoxia was married in Constantinople on 28 July 1261 to Count Guglielmo Pietro I of Ventimiglia and Tenda (1230‚Äì1283),Dictionnaire de la noblesse, Fran√ßois-Alexandre Aubert de la Chesnaye des Bois, Badier - 1774 count of Ventimiglia and Tende,The English Historical Review, Mandell Creighton, Justin Winsor, Samuel Rawson Gardiner, Reginald Lane Poole, John Goronwy Edwards, JSTOR, Longman, 1916 a Ligurian region then at the service of Genoa, allies with Michael VIII. This marriage originated the house Lascaris de Vintimille, which stood until the 19th century as a powerful French family. Eudoxia and Pietro had seven children: * Lucrezia Lascaris di Ventimiglia (1264 ‚Äì 1314), in 1281 she married to Arnau Roger de Comminges, Count of Pallars-Sobir√†, who died in 1288.

Before reaching 30, Eudoxia fled from Liguria to Aragon with her daughters Beatrice and Vatatza. Some say it was at the time of her husband's death or on being refused by him. Living at X√†tiva and Zaragoza and Castella, she travelled on diplomatic missions for King James II of Aragon.  End of life  In 1296 she founded a monastery of Poor Clares and the Sanctuary of Mare de D√©u de la Serra at Montblanc, which she entered by the end of 1306. She also donated to the monastery an Italian image of the Virgin, that still stands there. Her remains rest at the Dominican monastery at Zaragoza.

Concept  Institutional memory has been defined as \\"the stored knowledge within the organization.\\" Within any organization, tools and techniques will need to be adapted to meet that organization's needs. These adaptations are developed over time and taught to new members of the group, keeping them from encountering the same problems and having to develop a solution that already exists. In this way, organizations save time and resources that might otherwise be wasted. For example, two automobile repair shops might have the same model of car lift. The lifts themselves and the written instructions for them are identical. However, if one shop has a lower ceiling than the other, its employees may determine that raising a car beyond a certain height can cause it to be damaged by the ceiling. The current employees inform new employees of this workaround. They, in turn, inform future new employees, even if the person who originally discovered the problem no longer works there. Such information is in the repair shop's institutional memory. Institutional memory requires the ongoing transmission of memories between members of the group. As such, it relies on a continuity of group membership. If everyone at the aforementioned auto shop quit at once, the employees hired to replace them would not be able to benefit from the previous group's experience. In such a case, the organization would have lost its institutional memory and operate less efficiently until the workarounds that composed it could be developed again. Elements of institutional memory may be found in corporations, professional groups, government bodies, religious groups, academic collaborations, and by extension in entire cultures. There are different ideas about how institutional memory is transferred, whether it is between people or through written sources. Institutional memory may be encouraged to preserve an ideology or way of work in such a group. Conversely, institutional memory may be ingrained to the point that it becomes hard to challenge, even the conditions that caused it to arise have changed. An example of this would be an organization continuing to submit a form, even after the law requiring that document has been repealed, for fear of legal consequences that no longer exist. Institutional memory may also have influence on organizational identity, choice of individuals, and actions of the individuals interacting with the institution. Institutional knowledge Institutional knowledge is gained by organizations translating historical data into useful knowledge and wisdom. Memory depends upon the preservation of data and also the analytical skills necessary for its effective use within the organization. Religion is one of the significant institutional forces acting on the collective memory attributed to humanity. Alternatively, the evolution of ideas in Marxist theory is that the mechanism whereby knowledge and wisdom are passed down through the generations is subject to economic determinism. In all instances, social systems, cultures, and organizations have an interest in controlling and using institutional memories. Organizational structure determines the training requirements and expectations of behaviour associated with various roles. This is part of the implicit institutional knowledge. Progress to higher echelons requires assimilation of this, and when outsiders enter at a high level, effectiveness tends to deteriorate if this morale is unjustly ignored.

The long tunnel connects the and stations beneath Washington Road & West Liberty Ave. from Shady Drive East to McFarland Road at a maximum depth of , and runs beneath a cemetery. The pre-tunnel trolley street line, which ended in 1984, ran from the long-removed Clearview Loop stop on Alfred St. (Mt. Lebanon) to the intersection of McFarland Rd. and Raleigh Ave. (Dormont). The tunnel was constructed by a technique called the New Austrian Tunnelling method, a tunneling process developed in the early 1960s that has become the primary tunneling practice in Europe. This is the first time that this money-saving technique was used for transit construction in the United States. The difference with NATM lies in the means of support required to maintain the rock cavity and the configuration of the tunnel structure. With conventional tunneling, support of the rock cavity consists of a rib cage framework of steel beams and horizontal wooden planks. A reinforced steel concrete lining is added to create a perfectly shaped tunnel. With NATM, the rock surrounding the hole becomes the support system. This is done by lining the tunnel cavity with several thin layers of shotcrete, concrete that is blown on under air pressure. The tunnel has continuous television surveillance.

The movie was directed by Henry Koster, and written by Bruce Manning and Felix Jackson. It won the Venice Film Festival for Special Recommendation. Plot In New York City, Frenchwoman Nicole de Cortillon seeks modeling work and manages to steal a name and address from a modeling agency by lying about her qualifications, but it is the wrong information. She starts undressing in the advertising office of a very puzzled Jim Trevor. When she finally realizes he is not a photographer, she storms out. Nicole is locked out of her room by her landlady for being behind on her rent, but her friend Gloria helps her out by paying the arrears. Gloria suggests she try to snare a rich husband. Gloria is good friends with Mike, the head waiter at the ritzy Savoy Grand Hotel, so she tries to get him to hire Gloria. Mike has no openings, but mentions that he has saved $3000 to open a restaurant. He needs another $2000, so Gloria convinces him to finance a scheme to have Gloria attract the attention of Bill Duncan, a regular hotel guest who \\"owns half of Canada\\". Nicole and Gloria settle into a suite across the hall from Bill's. The plan hits a snag when Bill's good friend Jim Trevor recognizes her. Jim demands she tell Bill the truth. She agrees, but reneges. When Jim tells Bill, Bill does not believe him, as they have both lied before to steal each other's girlfriends. Jim blackmails Nicole into dining with him and gets her to confess that she needs $3000 in front of his butler Rigley. He departs to inform Bill, but she escapes Rigley's custody and gets to Bill first. When Bill introduces Nicole to his family, Jim brings Rigley to the reception, but Bill remains unconvinced and punches Jim in the jaw. Ashamed, Nicole follows after Jim and offers to confess all, but he does not believe her. She gets into Jim's car to see if he has been injured. He then drives off with her, taking her to his isolated country retreat, where his caretaker mistakes her for his new wife. That night, Nicole confesses to Jim that she has fallen in love with him, but he only asks her when she found out he is richer than Bill. She slips out and hitches a ride back to New York. Bill finally discovers the truth and becomes worried about a breach of promise lawsuit. Mike promises to get Nicole to leave the country ... in exchange for his money back ($5000). Nicole boards a ship bound for France. There she finds Jim, who is arranging for the captain to marry them.

The village is on the River Till at the southern edge of Salisbury Plain, on both sides of a single-carriageway stretch of the busy A303 trunk road. Geography The parish of Winterbourne Stoke mostly consists of downland, with chalk outcrops in places. It is bisected from north to south by the River Till, which rises to the north on Salisbury Plain, and which was originally called the River Winterbourne. The village is located at the junction of the B3083, running north and south, and the A303 trunk road, running east and west. The land is gently sloping; level areas near the river have been used as meadowland and slightly sloping land for arable cropping since the Middle Ages. Most of the Parsonage Down national nature reserve is within the parish. This ancient downland is rich in wild flowers as well as having scrubby areas where yellowhammers and turtle doves flourish. History Especially in its east part, the parish is rich in archaeological remains. The Greater and Lesser Cursus are Neolithic monuments, and there are a group of seventeen long barrows, some of which are in neighbouring parishes. A Romano-British settlement has been identified on Winterbourne Stoke Down, as well as some medieval earthworks. Notable buildings The Church of England parish church of St Peter (12th century with 19th-century restoration) is Grade II* listed, as is the 17th-century Manor House.

In 2004, the line merged with the Sanshui‚ÄìMaoming railway to form the Guangzhou‚ÄìMaoming railway. Map showing the route of the Canton to Sam Shui railway built 1902‚Äì1904 Introduction The 32 mile-long railway line from Canton (Guangzhou) to Sam Shui (Sanshui) was constructed between 1902 and 1904 by the American China Development Company. Commencing from its Shek Wei Tong: () terminus and depot in Canton (Guangzhou) this short line was built as a branch line of the Canton‚ÄìHankow (Guangzhou‚ÄìHankou) railway and was the first portion of this southern trunk line to be constructed. The first 10 miles from Canton to Fatshan (Foshan) opened in late 1903 and the remainder to Sam Shui was completed and formally opened on 23 September 1904.\\"Railway Enterprise in China ‚Äì An Account of its Origin and Development\\" by Percy Horace Kent, London 1907The Far Eastern Review: January 1906 Financing and survey left The origins of this railway go back to the so-called ‚ÄúBattle for Concessions‚Äù during 1898 when Western powers bickered among themselves over the extraction of railway concessions from the Qing Dynasty government, severely weakened by their loss of the war with Japan over Korea. Not wishing to be left out of the fray, a powerful American syndicate known as the American China Development Company, formed under the auspices of financier Calvin Brice in April 1898, obtained a concession for the construction of the -long Canton‚ÄìHankow (Guangzhou‚ÄìWuhan) Railway. In the autumn of 1898 a team of American engineers led by Chief Engineer William Barclay Parsons was dispatched to China to conduct the survey. Barclay Parsons describes the difficulties endured during this survey in his own account of this work ‚ÄúAn American in China‚Äù published in 1900 after his return to USA.\\"An American Engineer in China\\" by Wm. Barclay Parsons, New York 1900 Construction delayed Post card dated c. 1903 showing railway at Canton The American syndicate soon ran into all kinds of difficulties. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had broken out causing a shortage of funds. On top of this, the leading driver of the scheme, Senator Brice, died leaving the syndicate without any enthusiastic and wealthy investors. Many of the Americans, who owned shares, became disillusioned and gradually sold out to French-Belgian interests, while the battle for control of the line continued. The next incident to delay the construction was the 1900 Boxer Uprising. However eventually in the autumn of 1902, with the American syndicate now under the presidency of Barclay Parsons, the short Canton-Sam Shui branch line was commenced. The American team of engineers sent to build the branch was headed by Chief Engineer C.W. Mead CE. Foshan section Forney-type tank locomotive from the Manhattan Elevated Railway on the Guangdong‚ÄìSanshui railway in 1903 The first section of about 10 miles from Canton (Guangzhou) to Fatshan (Foshan) was double-tracked standard gauge line using steel rails. Because of the shortage of funds economies were made by purchasing used equipment from the United States and this included eight reconditioned ex-Manhattan Elevated Railway \\"Forney\\"-type tank locomotives, which had been built in 1885‚Äì1856 and were designed for running backwards (cab-first).The Locomotive Magazine, April 1903 Most of the stations along the route were initially small temporary mat-shed structures and the only permanent station erected in time for the opening of the railway was at Fatshan. This section was opened to traffic in late 1903. SanShui section Construction of the next section from Foshan to SanShui was then continued and a ceremony attended by the railway's senior staff and a number of invited guests was held on 22 September 1904 to drive in the ‚Äòlast (silver) spike‚Äô, marking completion of the line.The Far Eastern Review October 1904 By this time the railway had received its first two-passenger engines which were 4-4-0 tender locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company of Pittsburgh in 1903. In later years it acquired similar locomotives from both the Baldwin and Lima locomotive companies\\"Steam Locomotive Lists in China\\" by Mitsuhiro Katsurawa, Stephenson Locomotive Society Termination of concession While the Guangzhou‚ÄìHankou Railway was stalled, the Belgians were making good progress on the Beijing‚ÄìHankou Railway. A diplomatic incident arose when it was discovered that the French and Belgians had purchased a majority stake in the American China Development Company. This contravened the Chinese decision to prevent a single foreign power from controlling the Beijing‚ÄìGuangzhou Railway by awarding two concessions to different countries. Growing opposition to foreign ownership of railways pushed the Chinese government to cancel the American concession in December 1904, putting the Guangzhou‚ÄìSanshui Railway into Chinese hands. The Belgian concession for the Beijing‚ÄìHankou Railway would also be redeemed in 1909.

He was drafted by the Montreal Alouettes in the first round of the 2008 CFL Draft and would play there for six seasons before signing with the Toronto Argonauts in 2014. He played CIS Football at the University of British Columbia after playing three seasons of NCAA Football at Eastern Washington. He is the founder and CEO of WellMen Project, a men's adventure club which aims to empower men to take initiative in their own mental wellness.  Professional career  Montreal Alouettes = Emry spent 6 seasons with the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, spanning from the 2008 CFL season through the 2013 CFL season. His best season with the Als was the 2012 season in which he was named a CFL All-Star after recording a career-high 87 tackles. He finished his time with Montreal amassing 261 tackles (average of 43.5 tackles per season), 44 special teams tackles, 13 sacks, 4 interceptions, 1 fumble recovery and 1 defensive touchdown. = Toronto Argonauts = On February 11, 2014, the first day of CFL free-agency, Emry signed a three-year contract with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.Emry signs with Argonauts In his first and only season in Toronto Emry recorded 72 tackles after playing in all 18 regular season games. = Saskatchewan Roughriders = On January 24, 2015, Emry was acquired by the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Toronto received DE Ricky Foley in the trade.Returning Home: Riders trade Foley back to Toronto Emry would go on to play one half of a game with the Roughriders, before suffering a career ending injury during the first game of the 2015 season against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. On February 3, 2016, Emry officially announced his retirement after playing eight seasons in the CFL, mostly with the Montreal Alouettes.  Personal life  Two time grey cup champion, 2012 Defensive Player of the Year Runner-Up, 2012 Canadian Player of the Year Runner-Up, and six year Canadian Football League Veteran, All-Star Middle Linebacker Shea Emry is tackling his most momentous challenge yet, bringing awareness to the ways in which men can proactively serve and enhance their quality of life and potential. After suffering a concussion, which put him out for the remainder of the football season in 2011, Emry found himself battling trials of the past. Negative self-talk, isolation, and an intensifying self-consciousness drew him back into the depressive state he had known as an adolescent; having been the victim of extreme childhood bullying. In early 2012 Emry was inspired to use his platform in professional sport to share his story with youth, inspiring self-care and conversation concerning wellness and mental health. So he founded Wellmen. His mission to change the stigma was ignited. Honoring his contribution to community and the landscape of mental health, he won the Jake Gaudaur Veteran's Trophy; a distinction appointed to the individual who most exemplifies the values of Canada's Veterans. The prestigious award was given to him at the Grey Cup's CFL annual Players Awards, on behalf of the commissioner and Veterans Affairs Canada, whose mandate is to acknowledge the legacy of those who have contributed to Canada's development as a nation. Shea has shared his story and self care practices with thousands of youth, aspiring athletes, as well as professionals pioneering solutions to mental health challenges. His mission has led him to many collaborations and ignition platforms such as the CN Together At School Program, rallying sixty thousand students; and Saidat Music Movement and Motivation, reaching nearly thirty thousand kids and teenagers in an anti bullying and awareness campaign. In partnership with Action on Mental Illness (AMI) Quebec, Shea was hosted by AMI Board Member Lynn Nulman and her husband, founder of Just For Laughs, Andy Nulman, to share his vision for mental wellness and offer his story to tastemakers and influencers. This year as Movember‚Äôs Quebec Spokesperson for Men's Mental Health, Shea's impact was far- reaching. He hosted 4 Movember events across Canada including co-hosting the Closing Gala in Vancouver. Shea took his mission to numerous radio and television outlets like Breakfast Television, CTV, TSN and TSN radio, championing the conversation around men's mental health. His idea is simple: an individual's personal evolution requires an individual's personal initiative.

Much of Hobcaw Barony is south of US Highway 17. The land was purchased by the investor, philanthropist, presidential advisor, and South Carolina native Bernard M. Baruch between 1905 and 1907 for a winter hunting retreat. Later, his eldest child, Belle W. Baruch, began purchasing the property from her father beginning in 1936. By 1956, Belle owned Hobcaw Barony entirely. Upon her death in 1964, the property was transferred to the Belle W. Baruch Foundation for a nature and research preserve. The property includes more than 37 historic buildings and structures representative of the eras of both 18th & 19th century rice cultivation and 20th century winter retreats. Hobcaw Barony was named to the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 1994. The Belle W. Baruch Foundation and the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve jointly operate the Hobcaw Barony Discovery Center and provide tours and special programs. History In 1718, John, Lord Carteret was given a royal grant of barony on Hobcaw Point at the southern end of Waccamaw Neck. In 1766 and 1767, the tract was surveyed and sold in several parcels. These were developed into about a dozen rice plantations that contributed to Georgetown County's substantial rice production between the American Revolution and the Civil War. After the Civil War, rice production decreased due to the lack of slave labor and increased production of rice in Louisiana. Barnard Baruch acquired the tract and additional land in three purchases from 1905 to 1907 to be developed as a winter hunting retreat. Although rice was no longer cultivated, the canals and embankments were retained to provide an attractive environment for waterfowl. Starting in 1935, Baruch began selling parts of Hobcaw Barony to his daughter, Belle Baruch. The first tract was 5,000 acres in the northern portion of the property. She built a house and stable complex, Bellefield Plantation, a stable cottage for her stable manager, Jean Darthez, and a small airport hangar. Before Belle Baruch's death in 1964, she established the Belle W. Baruch Foundation to perpetuate Hobcaw Barony as an educational institute for forestry and marine biology. Hobcaw House complex 150px The Hobcaw House was the Baruch family winter retreat. It is about south of the main entrance and overlooks Winyah Bay. It was built in 1930 to replace the Donaldson House, which burned in December 1929. The red brick house was designed by the Columbia, South Carolina, architects Lafaye and Lafaye. Barnard Baruch entertained many friends at Hobcaw Barony. Winston Churchill and his daughter, Diana, visited in 1932. President Roosevelt took a month-long working vacation in Spring 1944 during World War II. Ralph Pulitzer, Walter Huston, Generals George C. Marshall, Omar Bradley and Mark Clark, and Senators Robert A. Taft and Harry F. Byrd were a few of his notable guests. Bellefield Plantation complex The Bellefield House Complex is about south of the main entrance. The house was designed by Murgatroyd and Ogden of New York and built in 1936 with Lafaye and Lafaye of Columbia providing specifications. It is a two-story frame house with four single-story wings and a brick service wing to the rear. The house has a gabled roof. The house is built on a raised terrace with live oaks and pines. The chief landscape architect was Umberto Innocenti of New York and New Jersey. The Bellefield Garage, also design by Murgatroyd and Ogden, had parking for four vehicles, a laundry, and two rooms for servants. The Bellefield Stable, which was considered essential by Belle, was designed by John D. W. Churchill of New York and built in 1937. The kennel for hunting dogs and the fowl coop are nearby. Slave settlements Friendfield Church A number of old slave settlements are extant. Friendfield Village is between Kings Highway and Hobcaw Road. It has five unused houses, a church and a dispensary. There are several antebellum slave cabins built prior to the Civil War. Two others were remodeled in 1905. The Friendfield Church, which was built in 1890, is a rectangular building with board-and-batten siding, a gabled metal roof, and a pyramidal spire. Two additional cottages in Friendfield Village were built around 1935. Barnyard Village is also on the old Friendfield Plantation. There is one antebellum cabin that was remodeled in the period from 1890 to 1905. Two residences for employees of Hobcaw Barony were constructed in 1925. Strawberry Village is north of the Hobcaw Barony Complex in an isolated area. The Strawberry School was built in 1915 for the African-American children at Hobcaw Barony and was expanded in 1935. Rice fields The rice fields played a major role in the 19th century life of the area. Many of the canals, banks, and trunks have been maintained on Hobcaw Barony. About of the Alderley and Oryzantia, of the Youngfield and Bellefield, of the Strawberry Hill, and of the Michaux and Calais Plantations remain. About of the Marrietta, Friendfield, and Strawberry Hill Plantations have been altered. Other Over of forests remain consisting of hardwood species, loblolly and longleaf pine, and cypress/tupelo swamps. Although the majority has not been timbered since Baruch's purchase, some harvesting was done in 1944 and 1945 to support war mobilization. Portions of the King's Highway remain as a dirt road from near Highway 17 to Frasers Point on Winyah Bay south of the Hobcaw House Complex. Bellefield Airport hangar was constructed for two planes used by Belle Baruch. The field was leased to the US Army in 1942 for the war effort. Portions of the Friendfield Plantation Rice Mill remain. The brick building with chimney and a winnowing house were probably built in the 1870s. There are old cemeteries including the Calais Cemetery at Frasers Point, the Fairfield or Donaldson Cemetery, the Alderly Cemetery, and the Marietta/Bellefield Cemetery. As of 2013 salt marshes have slightly expanded at the expense of forest due to rising sea levels as encroaching sea water kills trees.  Art theft  In 2003, former curator Sammy McIntosh left Bellefield House and moved to Kingstree because his contract had not been renewed for cause. On his last night in the house, a number of pieces of art mysteriously disappeared. About three weeks later, Williamsburg County deputies recovered the stolen print \\"Sporting Life\\" by John Leache, whose estimated value was about $12,000, along with other items belonging to the foundation from McIntosh's house. He was charged with four counts of breach of trust with fraudulent intent, one count of receiving stolen goods and one count of filing a false police report, according to court records. He was sentenced to three years probation after pleading no contest. However, the most important pieces of art, a Sir Alfred Munnings portrait of Belle Baruch and her horse Souriant and two studies along with seven Audubon prints remained missing. The Baruch Foundation offered a $25,000 reward for information about the whereabouts of the missing artwork. There was little activity though until an \\"Antiques Roadshow\\" episode aired in February 2013. They hoped this would generate some leads, but unfortunately no real leads were found and the trail went dead until 2016. In 2016, John and Patty Ivy of Ivy Auctions in Laurens, SC, were hired to sell the contents of an estate in the area. Upon receiving the art for cataloging in the sale, the Ivys recognized the artist name and contacted their colleague, Converse College associate professor Frazer Pajak, to help identify and catalog the work. Pajak, who coincidentally had done some work for the Baruch foundation for architectural sketches of Hobcaw knew the work immediately. The Ivys contacted George Chastain, director of the Belle Baruch Foundation in Georgetown, SC, and the FBI in order to return the art to the rightful owners. The paintings have been returned to The Baruch Foundation and will hopefully be restored and find their way back to Bellefield House at Hobcaw. Six paintings of Hobcaw Barony by artist Louis Aston Knight remain at large as of 2016. Modern facilities Modern non-contributing properties are on Hobcaw Barony.

Penydarren is a community and electoral ward in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough in Wales. Description The area is most notable for being the site of a 1st-century Roman fort, and during the Industrial Revolution it housed Penydarren Ironworks the third largest of the great Merthyr works. Penydarren was also used by Richard Trevithick as the location for his experiments into steam locomotion. The community and ward has a population of 5,253,Penydarren Ward 2001 Census: Census Area Statistics: National Statistics. UK government. Retrieved 1 March 2009 increasing to 5,419 at the 2011 Census. Penydarren Park, the site of the Roman fort and the football ground, is today outside the community boundary.  Roman fort  Being located on a spur of land above sea level, just southwest of the River Taff, made Pen-y-Darren an ideal location to build an occupation outpost fort for the Romans in AD75, during the governorship of Sextus Julius Frontinus. It was during this period that he subdued the Silures and other hostile tribes of Wales by establishing a new base at Caerleon or Isca Augusta for Legio II Augusta, and this was one of a network of smaller forts fifteen to twenty kilometres apart for his auxiliary units. The only information known about the fort is from the later excavations undertaken during the construction of the football stadium in 1905 by Frank Treharne-James, and in 1957 during the demolition of Penydarren House. From the combination of these works, it is presently estimated that the fort had a turf and clay rampart wide, set on a cobble foundation and separated by a narrow berm of wide from its double ditch. The inner ditch was wide, the outer wide, separated by a berm of . If a well recorded by Treharne-James in 1905 was centrally placed within the principia, and a square outline is assumed, then the fort had dimensions of across the rampart crests, covering an area of . Flavian pottery confirms the origin of the fort as a wooden structure, replaced in stone around AD 100, with the bath house located outside the fort's southern defences contemporary with the rebuilding. The latest pottery recovered is Trajanic, confirming that the site was abandoned in the Hadrianic period, with its garrison, moved to a new build fort at Gelligaer.  Penydarren House  After Samuel Homfray came to South Wales, and establishing the Penydarren Ironworks, he won a bet with Richard Crawshay, and with the proceeds built Penydarren House in 1786 on the site of the Roman fort. It was during the construction that workmen first found Roman bricks and the remains of a tessellated pavement. Developed on a site opposite the works, but \\"sufficiently removed from the town by the extent of the pleasure grounds, and contains all the conveniences and the luxuries requisite for a family of wealth and importance,\\" Homfray was waited on by servants who were dressed in a scarlet and buff livery, while he was driven everywhere in a coach and four horses. In 1800, Homfray married Jane Morgan, daughter of Sir Charles Morgan, 1st Baronet of Tredegar House, and thus obtained a favorable lease of mineral land at Tredegar, where he established the Tredegar Ironworks. In 1813 he was appointed High Sheriff of Monmouthshire and in 1818, returned as Member of Parliament for Stafford borough. Penydarren House was requisitioned by the UK Government at the start of World War II, it was handed over to the Ministry of Works in 1943. The house was demolished in 1957, and after a period of archeological excavation of the Roman fort, the site was redeveloped as the present day housing community.  The \\"Pen-y-Darren\\" locomotive  Full-scale replica of Trevithick's 1804 steam-powered railway locomotive in the National Waterfront Museum, Swansea. In 1802, Homfray commissioned engineer Richard Trevithick to build built one of his high-pressure steam engines to drive a hammer at the Penydarren Ironworks. With the assistance of works engineer Rees Jones, Trevithick mounted the engine on wheels and turned it into a locomotive. In 1803, Trevithick sold the patents for his locomotives to Homfray. Homfray was so impressed with Trevithick's locomotive that he made another bet with Crawshay, this time for 500 guineas (¬£525), that Trevithick's steam locomotive could haul 10 tons of iron along the Merthyr Tydfil Tramroad from Penydarren () to Abercynon (), a distance of . Amid great interest from the public, on 21 February 1804 it successfully carried 11.24 tons of coal,Smithsonian Institution. (2014). Train: The definitive visual history. five wagons and 70 men over the full distance, in 4 hours and 5 minutes, at an average speed of . As well as Homfray, Crawshay, and the passengers, other witnesses included Mr. Giddy, a respected patron of Trevithick, and an 'engineer from the Government'. The latter was probably a safety inspector, who would have been particularly interested in the boiler's ability to withstand high steam pressures. In modern Merthyr, behind the monument to Trevithick's locomotive, is a stone wall, which is the sole remainder of the former boundary wall of Penydarren House.  1811-1856: Merthyr Rising  The Penydarren Ironworks had been financed by William Forman of the Tower of London, who provided all the capital, partly on mortgage but also by taking shares himself. Samuel Homfray left the business in 1813, selling both the house and his shares in the Penydarren Ironworks to Foreman. The house played a key role in the Merthyr Rising. On 2 June 1831, while local employers and magistrates were holding a meeting with the High Sheriff of Glamorgan at the Castle Inn, a group led by Lewsyn yr Heliwr (also known as Lewis Lewis) marched there to demand a reduction in the price of bread and an increase in their wages. The demands were rejected, and after being advised to return to their homes, attacked the inn. Engaged by the 93rd (Highland) Regiment, after the rioters seized some of their weapons, the troops were commanded to open fire. After a protracted struggle in which hundreds sustained an injury, some fatal, the Highlanders were compelled to withdraw to Penydarren House and abandon the town to the rioters. For eight days, Penydarren House was the sole refuge of authority in the district.  Development and the James family  Forman offered the works for sale in 1859, and the Dowlais Iron Company bought the mineral ground. Foreman subsequently sold the house and its estate to the James family. While the site of the Ironworks was left to decay, eventually becoming the service depot of the Merthyr tramway, from 1870, parts of the estate were sold off for housing development. For the period 1876 to 1888, the family leased the house out to the Merthyr Proprietary School. In the 1890s, developments included the general hospital, the Roman Catholic Church of St. Mary's, and the imposing Park Terrace and nearby large villas. The filling in of the former fish pond marked at Bryant's Field allowed the development of Penydarren Park between 1902 and 1905, during which additional excavation of the Roman fort was undertaken by Frank Treharne-James. This also allowed the development of the terraces along Gwaelod-y-Garth lane, including Stuart, Cromwell, and Tudor. By 1910, the Edwardian Baroque YMCA and the Masonic Temple had been completed, and post World War I Penydarren had become Merthyr Tydfil's premier middle-class suburb, with the addition of further terraces north and south of Dane Street, and properties along the Grove. Electoral ward Penydarren was an electoral ward to Mid Glamorgan County Council from 1973 to 1996. Penydarren has subsequently become an electoral ward (coterminous with the community) to Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. It elects three county councillors. At the May 2017 elections two Independent candidates (Kevin Gibbs and Chris Davies) and one Labour Party candidate (David Isaac) came top of the poll.

Early life Dahlmann was born in Thionville as the son of a trumpeter and enlisted in the French Army in 1777 at the age of 8, where his father and older brother were already serving in the Regiment Dauphin Cavalerie, which later in 1791 became the 12e R√©giment de Cavalerie. Napoleonic wars Dahlmann served with the infantry and was deployed at the Armee de la Moselle and the Armee des Pyrenees Orientales. He was wounded at his right leg at Peyrestortes on 17 September 1793. From 1796 to 1798 he saw action with the Armee d'Italie and joined the Guides-a-Cheval de Bonaparte when they were formed in June 1796. He went to Egypt with the Armee d'Orient and served at Salahieh and Aboukir. He returned to France with Napoleon in 1798 and became Chef d'Escadron of the Chasseurs-a-Cheval in October 1802. He served at Austerlitz and was promoted Colonel-Major of the Chasseurs-a-Cheval de la Garde Imperiale. Dahlmann saw further action at the Battle of Jena and was promoted to General-de-Brigade in the age of 36. Throughout the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 he was attached to the Imperial staff but requested to lead his old unit, the Chasseurs √† Cheval, in a cavalry charge on 8 February 1807. He was seriously wounded in his right hip from a heavy calibre artillery piece and died on 10 February 1807 in the manor house of Worienen. Napoleon granted Dahlmann's widow a pension of 6,000 francs and in 1811 accorded his only son the title of Baron de l'Empire at the age of 10.

It lies on the A360 road between Stonehenge and Tilshead. It is close to the source of the River Till, which flows south to Stapleford.  History  Domesday Book of 1086 recorded three estates held by Edward of Salisbury at Wintreburne, in all with 43 households. The name Shrewton came into use from 1236 and is derived from the Old English scƒ´r-rƒìfa t≈´n, meaning 'sheriff's farm or settlement'. Addeston was a village of medieval origin, which now forms an integral part of the modern village of Shrewton. The place name survives in Addestone Farm () and Addestone Manor (). A village or hamlet called Netton lay in the east of the parish, but dwindled away by the 19th century; the name survives in Nett Road and Net Down. In 1934 the civil parish of Shrewton was enlarged by the addition of the parishes of Maddington (to the south and west) and Rollestone (south and east). RAF Shrewton, a Second World War Royal Air Force airfield with grass runways, was to the north of village. It closed in 1946 and its site returned to farmland. Governance The parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The parish is in 'Till and Wylye Valley' electoral ward. This ward starts in the south at South Newton, passes through Shrewton and ends in the north at Tilshead. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 4,473. ChurchesParish church= St Mary's Church, Shrewton The Church of England parish church of St Mary, on the High Street, was built in the late 12th or early 13th century and has a 16th-century west tower. During restoration and enlargement in 1855 by T. H. Wyatt, the north porch was added, and the chancel, nave arcades and south aisle rebuilt; fragments of 12th-century work survive in some of the arcade pillars. Wyatt also replaced the nave roof, raising it with a clerestory, which is criticised by Pevsner as having \\"dwarfed the tower\\". Three of the six bells were cast in 1619. The Romanesque-style font by Wyatt is described as \\"especially good\\" by Historic England. The building, in flint and limestone ashlar, was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1958. The benefices of Shrewton and Maddington were united in 1869 and Rollestone was added in 1923, but the three parishes remained distinct until 1970. Today the church is part of the Salisbury Plain Benefice. =Maddington= St Mary's Church in the Maddington part of the parish was built in the late 12th century. It is also Grade II* listed and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church has Norman origins, belonging to Amesbury Priory in 1179, with the earliest parts of the existing building dating from the late 12th and early 13th century, although there have been several alterations since, including the renewal of the roof of the nave in 1603. Sir Stephen Fox became the lord of the manor in the late 17th century and paid for the rebuilding of the chancel and redecoration. In 1853 the chancel was rebuilt and the whole church restored by T. H. Wyatt, including the erection of the gabled porch. The walls of the nave and chancel have a chequerboard pattern of flint and sandstone. There is a low west tower. The interior includes a large plaster cartouche of strapwork enclosing the date 1637, which may the date of construction of a gallery which has since been demolished. The stained glass includes work by Alexander Gibbs in the south aisle. The church was declared redundant in 1975 and passed to the Redundant Churches Fund in 1979 which later became the Churches Conservation Trust. =Rollestone= St Andrew's Church in the Rollestone settlement was built in the early 13th century. A Grade II* listed building, it is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is built of flint and stone in a chequerwork pattern. It has two large Perpendicular windows, and a font from the 13th century. The oak benches were brought from the redundant church of St Catherine‚Äôs at Haydon, Dorset in 1981.  Other buildings  The village lock-up Shrewton Manor, on the High Street, is a 17th-century house in limestone and flint, with extensions built in the early 19th and early 20th centuries. Next to the bridge over the Till is a domed village lock-up called The Blind House, dressed limestone, built around 1700. The sign on it reads \\"The Blind House. Village criminals were kept in this 18th Century prison\\". Shrewton House, northeast of the village, is a country house of c.1830. Amenities The village has a primary school, Shrewton CE VC Primary School. Appleford School, an independent specialist dyslexia school, is near the village. The whole length of the River Till is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Shrewton has a Non-League football club, Shrewton United F.C., who play at the Recreation Ground. The village also has a cricket club who play in the Hampshire League.

Adjacent to Layton, it was incorporated in 1936 in order to secure funding for a community water system. East Layton remained a small, steadily growing residential town for decades, becoming a city in 1972. Rapid expansion during the 1970s led to a merger in 1981 with Layton, now Davis County's most populous city and one of the largest in Utah. Geography East Layton stretched between Fairfield Road on the west and the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains on the east, containing the full length of Cherry Lane, the city's major street. The boundaries were irregular, but reached as far north as Antelope Drive (2000 North) and as far south as Gentile Street (the north-south origin of Layton's grid plan, now Utah State Route 109). East Layton Elementary School and Adams Reservoir are landmarks lying inside the former city limits, which encompassed a total area just under . City offices were located at 1010 N Emerald Drive (coordinates ), at the southwest corner of Andy Adams Park. The building is now home to a daycare center. History The East Layton area was settled together with Layton, as an outgrowth of Kaysville beginning in the 1850s. At Layton's incorporation in 1920, East Layton remained separate, a rural unincorporated area with only a few residents. =Founding= The local water supply was unreliable, a common problem in Utah's desert climate. Wells and streams often ran dry in late summer, and water would have to be hauled to homes by hand. Lifelong resident David Green envisioned a municipal water system supplied from Crooked Canyon in the Wasatch Mountains to the east. By the 1930s many of Green's neighbors were interested, but Utah's banks were lending very little money due to the Great Depression. Financing for public works was available through the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA), but only to incorporated municipalities. In January 1936, 53 East Layton residents signed a petition to form a town in order to fund the water system. On April 2, 1936, the town of East Layton was incorporated, with David Green as town board president. In 1937, East Layton voters unanimously supported a bond measure, and the WPA approved the town's loan application. The money, however, was slow to arrive. Members of the town board contacted Henry H. Blood, a native of Kaysville and then governor of Utah, and asked for help. Blood was able to use his influence to expedite the process, and East Layton's water project proceeded. David Green was the supervisor, directing a rotating team of laborers whose wages were paid by the WPA. They laid collection pipes from the mouth of Crooked Canyon down to a reservoir on Valley View Drive at the eastern edge of town. A wooden trestle bridged a gorge along the way. Rough terrain made digging difficult, and progress was slow. Costs mounted, and the original money ran out. The state of Utah provided additional support, matching funds for contributions by East Layton families. By the time of completion the WPA had covered about 60% of the expense. =Growth and merger= East Layton began as a sparsely populated rural community, and after incorporation its population initially declined, dropping from 160 in 1936 to 124 in 1940. From 1940 to 1950, while Layton's population increased fivefold, East Layton's less than doubled. Such growth characterized most of the town's history. The town completed an expanded reservoir in 1963, and a sewer system and enlarged water system in 1969. A special 1971 census counted 859 residents, making East Layton eligible to become a third-class city in January 1972. Despite continual residential growth, East Layton never had a commercial tax base to speak of; there were almost no businesses in town. Residents shopped in Layton or other nearby cities. Land developments in the 1970s brought explosive growth, as the city became an important residential community for nearby Hill Air Force Base. Tasked with providing municipal services for a city suddenly quadrupled in size, leaders opted with voter approval to become part of the larger and more diverse Layton City. The two merged on January 13, 1981. Development in the East Layton area has continued apace in the decades since; it is still a largely residential area, affluent and densely populated.

He was originally a student of Huim√≠ng, but this teacher reportedly sent Faru to East Mountain to study under Daman Hongren. Under Hongren, with whom he studied for sixteen years, Faru is traditionally thought to have received dharma transmission. After his time on East Mountain, Faru left to Luoyang, spending some time at Shaolin Monastery and helping to re-establish its prominence. Faru is notable in the history of Zen because the concept of a lineage, a fundamental notion in the identity of the school, seems to have originated with either him or his immediate followers. His epitaph speaks of an unbroken line of mind to mind transmission from Gautama Buddha to Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen, to Faru's teacher Hongren, and on to Faru himself. Other students of Hongren, however, claimed that they were the next point on the lineage and not Faru, however. These included Laoan, but most importantly Yuquan Shenxiu, who had a competing epitaph claiming he was the next patriarch of the lineage after Hongren. In modern Zen institutions, however, neither Shenxiu or Faru is traditionally considered the true heir of Hongren; that distinction lies with Huineng, a monk far less notable than Faru or Shenxiu who rose to prominence only after his death thanks to an extensive campaign by his student Heze Shenhui.

It is a variant of the modern pentathlon, without fencing. Thus it comprises the four disciplines of shooting, swimming, riding and running. Ideally, teams consist of four members from one pony club competing against several teams from rival clubs. Competitions are usually held over two days during the summer months. It is recommended that one skill and one endurance phase is completed on each day. For example, shooting and swimming will be on the first day, riding and running on the second. The competitions are organized using many volunteers and a few paid professionals. The United States Pony Clubs is a non-profit organization and the competitions are often hosted and subsidized by sponsors of the host club, local farmers, land owners and parents. There are three age categories, known as minimus, (8 to 11), junior (12 to 14) and senior (15 to 21). Boys and girls compete together. There is no minimum qualification standard to compete, but contests are only open to active pony club members, (in the US this means those who have attended at least three rallies that year). At the end of the games, rosettes are awarded to the top scores in each discipline, for the highest overall scores, and for the best team performances in each of the age and sex categories.  Swimming  Competitors are required to swim freestyle a distance appropriate for their age and the level at which they are competing. Swimming is scored on a grid of age, level and time. Competitors have to swim for 2 or 3 minutes depending on their age, in the United Kingdom. In the United States, competitors swim 50 yards/meters, 100 yards/meters, or 200 yards/meters depending on their age and/or division of competition. Swimming is usually the first sport that takes place in a tetrathlon because of the fact that it makes the participants the most tired, due to the amount of force that the participants have to exert while swimming.  Shooting  Competitors are required to shoot at stationary targets using .177 calibre air pistols from a range of 7 or 10 metres depending on their age. Younger (minimus) competitors are allowed to use two hands while older competitors must use only one. Ten shots are fired under timed conditions with a maximum of four seconds allowed per shot.  Riding  Competitors are required to complete a show jumping or cross country course including a number of fences (jumps) under timed conditions depending on the weather, if ground conditions are bad the competitor may not be timed. The size of the fences range from 2 foot 6 inches to 3 foot 6 inches depending on the age and competitive level of the competitors. Each course also includes a hazard section, containing a swinging gate which must be opened and closed while remaining on horseback, and a slip rail, through which riders lead their horse after dismounting. This element of the course is timed and is similar to that found in hunter trials.  Running  Competitors run across-country which may include obstacles under timed conditions. Distances are 1,000 metres, 1,500 metres and 3,000 metres depending upon age category in the United Kingdom, or 500 meters, 1000 meters, 2000 meters, or 3000 meters in the United States. Runners do not run against each other directly as in a marathon or race; instead start times are staggered at one-minute intervals.  Triathlon  Tetrathletes may also compete in triathlons (not to be confused with the running, swimming and cycling endurance event of the same name) that include the shooting, swimming and running elements as described above, but not the riding. These tend to be held during one day during the winter months when weather conditions are less favourable for the equestrian element.

It was written in 1868 and performed in 1869, but Tchaikovsky later destroyed the score, and it was published only three years after his death, with a posthumous opus number. History Tchaikovsky started the symphonic poem Fatum between late September and early October 1868.Tchaikovsky Research He put the work aside to devote his attention to the touring Belgian soprano D√©sir√©e Art√¥t, with whom he had fallen in love (or so he thought). They discussed marriage, and planned to meet again in the summer of 1869 in Paris to develop their plans. She then left for Warsaw to continue her tour with her opera company. Tchaikovsky completed the outline of the work by 21 October/2 November, and completed the scoring in December 1868. Its first performance took place on 15/27 February 1869 at the eighth concert by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow, conducted by Nikolai Rubinstein. Tchaikovsky had not written it with any known program, but for the premiere performance, the text of verses by Konstantin Batyushkov about the futility of human life were added as an epigraph to the score,Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man although it is not certain that this was Tchaikovsky's idea, or that he was even familiar with those verses. While the audience were baffled by the discrepancy between the melancholy theme of the Batyushkov verses and the brighter tenor of the music - its majestic introduction, lyrical and dance-like allegro, and cheerful finale - they nevertheless applauded the music warmly. On the evening of the debut, Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Anatoly, \\"It seems to be the best thing I have written so far; at least, that is what people are saying (a considerable success).\\" Tchaikovsky then sent the score to Mily Balakirev, and asked him to accept the dedication of the work. Balakirev accepted, and said he would arrange another performance, no matter what he thought of the music.Joh Warrack, Tchaikovsky, p. 55 Fatum was performed again in Saint Petersburg on 17/29 March at the ninth concert of the Russian Musical Society, conducted by Balakirev. However, the second performance was not the popular success the first performance had been. Balakirev wrote to Tchaikovsky: > Your Fatum has been performed [in St. Petersburg] reasonably well ... There > wasn't much applause, probably because of the appalling cacophony at the end > of the piece, which I don't like at all. It is not properly gestated, and > seems to have been written in a very slapdash manner. The seams show, as > does all your clumsy stitching. Above all, the form itself just does not > work. The whole thing is completely uncoordinated.... I am writing to you > with complete frankness, being fully convinced that you won't go back on > your intention of dedicating Fatum to me. Your dedication is precious to me > as a sign of your sympathy towards me‚Äîand I feel a great weakness for you. > M. Balakirev‚Äîwho sincerely loves you.Letter to Tchaikovsky from Balakirev, > 30 March 1869 Other critics also referred to its artistic unevenness. By now, both Tchaikovsky and D√©sir√©e Art√¥t had had a change of heart about their intended marriage. Neither advised the other of this, but he was nevertheless shocked when he learned through a third party (Nikolai Rubinstein) that she had married another man, the Spanish baritone Mariano Padilla y Ramos, in September 1869. Tchaikovsky's favourable view of Fatum had also changed - he had come to regard it as a failure. He destroyed the manuscript in the 1870s and it was not performed again or published in his lifetime. He did, however, re-use the lyrical theme from Fatum in the duet for Natalia and Andrei in Act IV of his opera The Oprichnik, but transposed from A-flat major to D-flat major. In 1896, after Tchaikovsky's death, the score was reconstructed from the original orchestral parts and published by Mitrofan Belyayev with the posthumous opus number 77. The piece has a duration of around 14 minutes. It has received a number of recordings. Instrumentation The music is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tam tam, harp and strings.

Yakub Hasan Sait was born in Nagpur and educated in Aligarh University. At a very young age, he moved to Bangalore for business purposes and settled in Madras in the year 1901. He served as a member of the Madras Corporation and as a member of the Madras Legislative Council. From 1937 to 1939, he served as the Minister of Public Works in the Rajaji government. Yakub Hasan Sait was a member of the Muslim League and later, the Indian National Congress. He was the only Muslim minister in Rajaji's 1937 cabinet.  Early life  Yakub Hasan Sait was born in Nagpur, Central Provinces and Berar in 1875. He had his schooling and early education in Nagpur and he had his higher education from Aligarh University. Soon after completion of his degree in 1893, Sait moved to Bangalore and started his career as a businessman. Sait moved to Madras in 1901 and gradually settled in the city. For a particular period of time, he worked as an international business agent under Nawab C. Abdul Hakim. Due to his immense knowledge of the Quran and other Muslim religious scriptures, Sait was often called \\"Maulana\\".  Early politics and formation of the All-India Muslim League  Soon after his arrival in Madras, Sait entered public life and was elected member of the Madras Corporation. Sait was one of founders of the All India Muslim League. He was an active party worker and visited England as a delegate of the League. He was also the only Muslim politician from the Madras Presidency involved in the drafting of the Lucknow Pact.  In the Indian Independence Movement  In 1916, Sait was elected to the Madras Legislative Council by the South Indian Chamber of Commerce. He joined the Indian National Congress and participated in the Khilafat agitations in 1919 and was imprisoned for six months. He was arrested and imprisoned once again in 1921 for his participation in the Non-Cooperation Movement. On his return from jail in 1923, he resigned from the Congress and founded the Madras Province Muslim League. This move was prompted by Sait's preference for Dominion Status when the Congress declaration of independence as its primary goal. As a result, no Muslim leader from the Presidency participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement. Sait stood for the elections and was elected to the Assembly. In 1927, Sait allied with the United Nationalist party of N. G. Ranga. A little before the 1937 elections, Sait, left the Madras Provincial Muslim League and joined the Indian National Congress. Soon, he became one of the top leaders of the provincial Congress. He condemned Mohammad Iqbal's two-nation theory and supported a united India. However, he still supported most of the other policies of the Muslim League.  In Rajaji's cabinet  Sait won the 1937 elections to the Madras assembly. He was made a minister in the Madras cabinet and was given in charge of the Public Works Department. Sait resigned along with other ministers when Britain declared war on Germany.  Death  In March 1940, a few months after resigning as Minister, Sait suffered chest pains and had to be hospitalized. He died soon afterwards.  Controversy  In the 1930s, most Tamil Muslim politicians were concentrated in the Madras Provincial Muslim League. These Muslim Leaguers were against the atheist policies of the Self-Respect Movement. At the same time, there was also not much support for the Indian National Congress amongst the Muslims in the Presidency. During his campaigning for the Indian National Congress, Sait was accused of disrespecting Islam at a meeting in Coimbatore by not standing while verses from the Quran were read. Throughout the remainder of the campaign, he was shown black flags at rallies.

Activated in 1965 as the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron, it served notably for seven and a half years of combat duty during the Vietnam War, and was inactivated in 1973. While in inactive status, the two squadrons were consolidated into a single unit. The 20th TASS was reactivated at Shaw Air Force Base in 1990, and again inactivated on 31 December 1991.

The aircraft was designated as a C-79 in USAAF service The 20th Transport Squadron was activated at France Field, Panama Canal Zone, on 15 December 1940, but had only one officer and no airplanes until February 1941. The squadron became operational by March 1941 when the Squadron obtained its first aircraft from France Field's 16th Air Base Squadron, a Douglas C-33. With this solitary aircraft, the Squadron undertook daily flights to Albrook Field and, from there, on to Rio Hato Field and return. By May, the squadron began flying international flights, starting with one to Managua, Nicaragua. Flying with two or three airplanes, the Squadron began the first of a series of cross-country flights to Trinidad in the British West Indies (some 1,200 air miles east of the Canal Zone) on 2 June 1941 to support the construction of the outer defense ring of air bases in the Caribbean after the United States obtained basing rights as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement with the British. By the time of the Pearl Harbor Attack on 7 December 1941, the unit had received six Douglas C-49s (impressed commercial DC-3s) from the United States. On 22 November 1941, six of the C-49s were detached to Howard Field in the Canal Zone as part of what came to be known as Flight \\"B\\" (Reinforced) of the squadron to work with the Army 501st Parachute Battalion and the 550th Airborne Infantry, which were training to act as a rapid deployment force in the Panama Canal defense scheme. The squadron became the 20th Troop Carrier Squadron in July 1942 and flew many different types of aircraft, several being one of a kind. The Squadron moved from France Field to Howard Field on 19 February 1942. Some aircraft were detached to Waller Field, Trinidad (Flight \\"A\\") and Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico (Flight \\"C\\"). Flight \\"A\\" left the squadron entirely on 22 December 1941 when it was detached to the 92d Air Base Group at Waller Field, Trinidad. The C-47s were followed on 19 June by two Consolidated OA-10 Catalina amphibians (which flew rescue missions in both the Pacific and Caribbean) and a locally procured Stinson C-91. It also flew a single Junkers C-79 trimotor, which was given USAAF serial 42-52883, and a Hamilton UC-89, a former Panamanian registered single-engine plane. These local acquisitions were a measure of the near-desperate need for transport aircraft being felt by the squadron and Sixth Air Force at the time. In March 1943, a pilot was dispatched to Santiago, Chile, to fly an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 tri- motor (lately of the Italian airline LATI) back to the Canal Zone. Boeing XB-15 at Howard Field, Panama, 1943.The aircraft had yet to undergo the modifications that resulted in its designation as the XC-105. It was scrapped in 1945. By early 1943, the unit had 30 officers and 234 enlisted. In January 1943, all of the 0A-10's were transferred to other units and the C-79, C-89 and C-91 were all occasionally grounded for extended periods as the ground crews attempted to deal with these non-standard aircraft. By June 1943, all had been reassigned out of the squadron. One replacement aircraft received by the squadron was the huge Boeing XC-105, which was converted from bomber to heavy transport configuration to meet Sixth Air Force's peculiar requirements for long frequent over-water resupply flights to Seymour Field in the Galapagos Islands. But the unit also got the first two Fairchild UC-61 Forwarders, a new Douglas C-47A and conducted long distance flights with cargo and personnel to resupply and evacuation of the small radar sites spotted around the periphery of the Canal. As Howard Field became more crowded with bomber units, the squadron moved in June 1943 to Albrook Field. By December 1943, the detachments in the Antilles, which had been leading essentially a separate existence from the \\"home\\" based Flight \\"A\\" in the Canal Zone, were finally detached from the squadron completely, and became assets of the Antilles Air Command, based at Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico, but dispersed throughout the Antilles. The unit was redesignated as the 20th Troop Carrier Squadron (Special) on 13 November 1943. By November 1944, the unit had finally started benefiting from the production of transport types in the United States, and could finally approach some semblance of standardization in its fleet. The last year of the war, with the general wind-down of the size and breadth of Sixth Air Force, saw a gradual reduction in the previously hectic flight schedules for 20th crews. By this time, the Squadron had also received some Curtiss C-46 Commandos. Routine transport operations within Panama, South and Central America continued, with a C-47 aiding a forest fire in the Peten region of Guatemala. =Postwar operations and Berlin Airlift= After the end of the war, the squadron continued to provide transport for Caribbean Air Command, and was equipped with Douglas C-54 Skymasters in 1946. It was attached to the 314th Troop Carrier Group, which moved to Albrook in October 1946.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 191 In July 1948, its heavy transports deployed to Germany to assist with the Berlin Airlift. The 20th moved from Panama to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas in September 1948. At Bergstrom, the squadron received Fairchild C-82 Packet medium transports in November 1948 and began transition training. In early January 1949, the squadron's air echelon deployed seven C-82s on temporary duty to Kearney Air Force Base, Nebraska, to transport supplies to snowbound ranchers and farmers, while the rest of the squadron moved at the end of January 1949 to Smyrna Air Force Base, Tennessee. The C-82s and aircrews arrived at Smyrna in late February 1949. While at Smyrna, the 20th trained with U.S. Army paratroopers from Fort Campbell, Kentucky in airborne tactics and carried cargo about the United States. The squadron inactivated on 20 October 1949 and most of its remaining resources were absorbed by the 316th Troop Carrier Group, which activated at Smyrna in November.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 194 =Combat Operations in Vietnam 1965 to 1973= 0‚Äì1 Bird Dogs, flightline of the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Da Nang Air Base, December 1966. Hu·∫ø Citadel Airfield, July 1967. La Vang Airfield, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, August 1967 The 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron was organized at Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam, on 8 May 1965. It received its first Cessna O-1 Bird Dog later that month. The squadron was fully operational by August 1965. It ran check flights for newly assigned aircrews, as well as flew visual reconnaissance and forward air control missions under various call signs. As it expanded, it stationed pilots and ground crews at several forward operating locations. However, it did not receive its full complement of over 30 Bird Dogs until the end of the year, as the turnover process from the U. S. Army was a slow one. The army was reluctant to surrender the Forward Air Control (FAC) role, but had agreed to do so under an inter-service agreement that allowed them to have helicopters. By the end of 1965, the 20th TASS was assigned the mission of directing interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh trail; this was dubbed Operation Tiger Hound. The squadron's original forward operating bases were at Khe Sanh, Kham Duc, and Kon Tum, which were very close to the Ho Chi Minh Trail, unlike Da Nang, which was the width of the country away. Other forward sites were added later for additional missions assigned to the squadron ‚Äì ƒê√¥ng H√†, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City (La Vang Airfield), Hu·∫ø Citadel Airfield, Hu·∫ø/Ph√∫ B√†i, Tam K·ª≥, Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, ƒê·∫Øk T√¥, Pleiku, and Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Combat Base. On July 1966, the squadron was tasked with a second area of operations. It was within North Vietnam, from the Demilitarized Zone 30 miles northward along Route Pack 1. These Operation Tally Ho missions directed naval gunfire as well as airstrikes. However, burgeoning antiaircraft defenses pushed the squadron's minimum operating level to 2,500 above ground level. By year's end, the risk had so increased that the squadron's Bird Dogs were withdrawn in favor of A-1 Skyraider FACs.Churchill, p. 67. During this period, it was decided that all cross-border flights would use call sign \\"Covey\\" and \\"Tally Ho\\" was dropped. In-country missions carried a variety of call signs, including \\"Jake\\" and \\"Trail\\". By this time, the Bird Dog's shortcomings were becoming apparent. It was a simple plane, easily maintained, highly maneuverable, and had good visibility. The fore and aft seating allowed both pilot and observer good views on both sides, and the high wing allowed a nearly unobstructed panorama. Vietnam People's Army and Viet Cong antiaircraft defenses were increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, however, and the slow, unarmored O-1 was ever more vulnerable to ground fire. In addition, its operational times were limited by its unsophisticated instrumentation and navigational equipment, which made flying in bad weather or at night difficult (night missions were particularly challenging and dangerous). Its lack of weaponry was also frustrating, as FACs could watch the enemy disappear while the strike aircraft were still en route. Frustrated FACs sometimes resorted to strafing the enemy with M-16 rifles fired out of the plane's windows. As a result, the 20th TASS began receiving Cessna O-2 Skymasters in 1967. The O-2 was a temporary solution, meant to serve until the OV-10 Bronco came on line. The O-2 was a modified Cessna 337 civilian plane. It was dual engined, with one engine at either end of the fuselage. The 20th was the first FAC squadron in Vietnam to receive it. The aircraft carried more ordnance, was capable of longer loiter times, had more power, and featured improved conventional navigation aids and in-flight instrumentation. Nevertheless, it had its own limitations. During this period, the squadron continued to fly 0-1s. In January 1969, the squadron began the transition from O-1s to the OV-10 Bronco. By July, the last O-1 was history, though the squadron continued to fly 0-2s. As of October 1969, 20th TASS aircraft, pilots and ground crews were assigned to 11 forward locations, five supporting the U. S. Army and six supporting the ARVN. Its headquarters remained at Da Nang. As the war wound down from 1970 through 1972, the squadron withdrew from its forward locations. The Easter Offensive by the PAVN in April 1972 made the 20th TASS return to FAC support from forward locations. It also temporarily tripled the squadron's sortie rate. When the North Vietnamese began to rocket Da Nang, the pilots of the 20th used their armed OV-10s to retaliate directly with rockets, strafing, and small bombs in addition to calling in air strikes. In January 1973, the squadron ceased combat. It turned over its O-2s to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and passed its Broncos along to other USAF units. On 15 January, the 20th was transferred as a paper unit to George Air Force Base, California. On 1 April 1973, it was inactivated and its service in Vietnam was over. In its nearly eight years in Vietnam, it had earned five Presidential Unit Citations, four Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with Combat \\"V\\" Device, and three Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Crosses with Palm. In addition, its pilots and crews earned many personal decorations. Losses and awards for Gallantry in Action The 20th lost more than 70 pilots during the Vietnam War. On 19 August 1967, Captain Donald D. Stevens, flying an O‚Äì2, risked heavy ground fire, which damaged his aircraft, for eight hours during the medical evacuation of a wounded American soldier and the extraction of a ground team sent in to help him. His gallantry won him the Air Force Cross. Four months later, on Christmas Day, Major Jerry Allan Sellers was killed when his O‚Äì2 was shot down during a night mission in which he saved a ground patrol from being overrun by illuminating ground targets with his landing lights so that gunships could direct accurate fire at the enemy. His lights drew heavy anti-aircraft fire, and he was shot down. He also earned an Air Force Cross. On 29 June 1972, Captain Steven L. Bennett's OV-10 was hit by a surface-to-air missile shredding the Observer's parachute. Rather than leave his observer to his fate, Bennett crash landed in the Tonkin Gulf. The observer escaped the sinking plane, but Bennett drowned. He was awarded the Medal of Honor, one of only two awarded to FACs in the war. On 11 July 1972 Major John Leonard Carroll a 20th TASS pilot on temporary duty with the 56th Special Operations Wing at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base and flying an O-1G Bird Dog as a Raven FAC, earned the squadron's third Air Force Cross. His aircraft was shot down over the Plaine des Jarres, Xiang Khoang Province Laos, and he was killed on the ground shooting it out with two PAVN companies attempting to capture him. The squadron's aircraft losses over the course of the war amounted to 31 O-1 Bird Dogs, 55 Cessna O-2 Skymasters, and 22 OV10 Broncos.Hobson 2001, p. 253. =Post Vietnam Operations= On 1 October 1973 the 20th TASS activated at Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany, to provide forward tactical air control for U.S. Army, Europe, and Seventh Army operations. The squadron had only three 0-2A aircraft available until July 1974, when it began flying OV-10A aircraft. Engaged in close air support training during USAFE, NATO, and U.S. Army exercises, its pilots served as both ground and airborne forward air controllers. During training exercises, the 20th deployed to and flew from bases in Italy, Spain, Denmark, Turkey, England, Belgium, West Germany, and The Netherlands. In January 1976, the squadron moved with the 601st Tactical Control Wing to Sembach Air Base, West Germany. In May 1981, it added search and rescue missions to its tasks. In 1984, it lost all OV-10 aircraft, squadron aircrews ferrying them to George AFB, Calif, June‚ÄìAugust 1984. squadron inactivated on 30 September 1984. 20th TASS OV-10 Broncos flying in formation at Shaw AFB in 1990 The 20th TASS was activated again on 1 April 1990 at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, as part of the 507th Tactical Air Control Wing, it was inactivated 31 December 1991. =Unmanned aerial vehicle operations= The USAF again activated the unit as the 20th Reconnaissance Squadron on 1 January 2011 at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. A geographically separated unit, the squadron is assigned to the 432d Operations Group of the 432d Wing, both of which are located at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. The activation ceremony for the squadron, held on 14 January 2011 at Whiteman, was attended by Ms. Angela Bennett-Engele, daughter of 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Steven L. Bennett and her family. The 20th Reconnaissance Squadron flew the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator remotely piloted aircraft on missions that include route reconnaissance, target marking, on-scene commander, intelligence-surveillance- and-reconnaissance, close air support and generally providing eyes, ears, and voice above the battlefield. In May 2016, the squadron was redesignated the 20th Attack Squadron, reflecting its growing primary role in close air support of US coalition forces. In October 2016, the 20th Attack Squadron began its transition to the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, flying its first combat mission in January 2017 while keeping the squadron involved in combat. The 20th Attack Squadron continued to fly the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator supporting both aircraft until 30 June 2017, when it flew its last combat mission with the Predator.

The curve was based on research conducted by David Solomon in the late 1950s and published in 1964. Subsequent research suggests significant biases in the Solomon study, which may cast doubt on its findings.  The original research  In 1964, Solomon researched the relationship between average speed and the collision rates of automobiles and plotted the results. While others have attempted to quantify the relationship between average speed and collision rates, Solomon's work was both \\"the earliest and best known\\". Solomon conducted a comprehensive study of more than 10,000 collision-involved drivers and their vehicles and how other roadway, driver, and vehicle characteristics affect the probability of being involved in a crash. He found that the probability of being involved in a crash per vehicle-mile as a function of on-road vehicle speeds follows a U-shaped curve with speed values around the median speed having the lowest probability of being in a crash. Although typically called the Solomon curve, the U-shaped curve has also been referred to as the Crash Risk Curve.  Subsequent research  In 1968, Julie Cirillo conducted a similar study of 2,000 vehicles on interstate highways that addressed speed variation‚Äôs impact on crashes that involved two or more vehicles. The Cirillo data produced a U-shaped curve similar to the Solomon curve. The Research Triangle Institute conducted a study in 1970 where data was collected on 114 crashes involving 216 vehicles on a state highway in Indiana to address these concerns by (1) combining automated, embedded speed-monitoring stations with trained on-scene crash investigators, and (2) distinguishing data on vehicles slowing to negotiate a turn from vehicles moving slowly in the flow of traffic.Research Triangle Institute, \\"Speed and Accident, Volume II,\\" Report No. FH-11-6965, National Highway Safety Bureau, June 1970. Reporting on these results in 1971, academics West and Dunn confirmed the findings of Solomon and Cirillo, but found that crashes involving turning vehicles accounted for 44 percent of all crashes observed in the study and that excluding these crashes from the analysis greatly attenuated the factors that created the U-shape of the Solomon curve.West, L. B., Jr. and Dunn, J. W. (1971). \\"Accidents, Speed Deviation and Speed Limits.\\" Traffic Engineering. 41 (10), 52-55 In 1991, Fildes, Rumbold, and Leening collected self-reported crash data from 707 motorists in Australia with fewer than 200 reporting that they had been in a collision but, unlike Solomon and Cirillo, the researchers found no relationship between slower speeds and increased crash involvement. Notwithstanding the many studies over the years, in testimony before the Ohio Senate Highways and Transportation Committee on June 10, 2003, Julie Cirillo, Former Assistant Administrator and Chief Safety Officer for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), testified that \\"up to the present time there has been no evidence to alter Solomon‚Äôs original finding that variance from the mean operating speed is a major contributor to accidents\\". In July 2001, Kloeden CN, Ponte G and McLean AJ of the Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University quantified the relationship, \\"... between free travelling speed and the risk of involvement in a casualty crash in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia\\" using a case control study design. They found, \\"..the risk of involvement in a casualty crash increased more than exponentially with increasing free travelling speed above the mean traffic speed and that travelling speeds below the mean traffic speed were associated with a lower risk of being involved in a casualty crash.\\" Outlining past research in this area, they suggest that, in the Solomon research, \\"Both the numerator (number of crashes in a particular speed band) and the denominator (number of vehicle-miles travelled in that same speed band) may have been quite inaccurate for relatively low speeds.\\"  Theoretical foundation  Hauer provided a theoretical foundation for the Solomon curve in 1971‚Äî‚Äúfor example, if I drive at 45 mph, while the median of the pack is 60 mph, how many cars will pass me in an hour and hence have a chance to collide with me?‚Äù‚Äîthat showed that the theoretical distribution was nearly identical to the Solomon curve.  Practical implications  While Solomon‚Äôs research focused on speed deviation, and not speed per se, some commentators have cited Solomon‚Äôs research to support the conclusion that raw speed and crash risk are not directly related. On the other hand, while recognizing Solomon's research reveals the importance to safety of variability around average speed, Leonard Evans concludes in Traffic Safety and the Driver that control of absolute driver speed, and not variability, should be the primary focus of traffic safety regulation. Both views support the fact that the seminal research underlying the Solomon curve shows that the greater the difference between a driver‚Äôs speed and the average speed of traffic‚Äîboth above and below that average speed‚Äîthe greater the likelihood of involvement in a crash. Consequently, many states and safety organizations advise drivers to ‚Äúdrive with the flow of traffic‚Äù.

In most models, these algorithms have access to limited memory (generally logarithmic in the size of and/or the maximum value in the stream). They may also have limited processing time per item. These constraints may mean that an algorithm produces an approximate answer based on a summary or \\"sketch\\" of the data stream. History Though streaming algorithms had already been studied by Munro and Paterson as early as 1978, as well as Philippe Flajolet and G. Nigel Martin in 1982/83, the field of streaming algorithms was first formalized and popularized in a 1996 paper by Noga Alon, Yossi Matias, and Mario Szegedy. For this paper, the authors later won the G√∂del Prize in 2005 \\"for their foundational contribution to streaming algorithms.\\" There has since been a large body of work centered around data streaming algorithms that spans a diverse spectrum of computer science fields such as theory, databases, networking, and natural language processing. Semi-streaming algorithms were introduced in 2005 as a relaxation of streaming algorithms for graphs , in which the space allowed is linear in the number of vertices , but only logarithmic in the number of edges . This relaxation is still meaningful for dense graphs, and can solve interesting problems (such as connectivity) that are insoluble in o(n) space. Models Data stream model = In the data stream model, some or all of the input is represented as a finite sequence of integers (from some finite domain) which is generally not available for random access, but instead arrives one at a time in a \\"stream\\". If the stream has length and the domain has size , algorithms are generally constrained to use space that is logarithmic in and . They can generally make only some small constant number of passes over the stream, sometimes just one. = Turnstile and cash register models = Much of the streaming literature is concerned with computing statistics on frequency distributions that are too large to be stored. For this class of problems, there is a vector \\\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\\\dots, a_n) (initialized to the zero vector \\\\mathbf{0}) that has updates presented to it in a stream. The goal of these algorithms is to compute functions of \\\\mathbf{a} using considerably less space than it would take to represent \\\\mathbf{a} precisely. There are two common models for updating such streams, called the \\"cash register\\" and \\"turnstile\\" models. In the cash register model each update is of the form \\\\langle i, c\\\\rangle, so that a_i is incremented by some positive integer c. A notable special case is when c = 1 (only unit insertions are permitted). In the turnstile model each update is of the form \\\\langle i, c\\\\rangle, so that a_i is incremented by some (possibly negative) integer c. In the \\"strict turnstile\\" model, no a_i at any time may be less than zero. = Sliding window model = Several papers also consider the \\"sliding window\\" model. In this model, the function of interest is computing over a fixed-size window in the stream. As the stream progresses, items from the end of the window are removed from consideration while new items from the stream take their place. Besides the above frequency-based problems, some other types of problems have also been studied. Many graph problems are solved in the setting where the adjacency matrix or the adjacency list of the graph is streamed in some unknown order. There are also some problems that are very dependent on the order of the stream (i.e., asymmetric functions), such as counting the number of inversions in a stream and finding the longest increasing subsequence.  Evaluation  The performance of an algorithm that operates on data streams is measured by three basic factors: * The number of passes the algorithm must make over the stream. * The available memory. * The running time of the algorithm. These algorithms have many similarities with online algorithms since they both require decisions to be made before all data are available, but they are not identical. Data stream algorithms only have limited memory available but they may be able to defer action until a group of points arrive, while online algorithms are required to take action as soon as each point arrives. If the algorithm is an approximation algorithm then the accuracy of the answer is another key factor. The accuracy is often stated as an (\\\\epsilon,\\\\delta) approximation meaning that the algorithm achieves an error of less than \\\\epsilon with probability 1-\\\\delta. Applications Streaming algorithms have several applications in networking such as monitoring network links for elephant flows, counting the number of distinct flows, estimating the distribution of flow sizes, and so on. They also have applications in databases, such as estimating the size of a join . Some streaming problemsFrequency moments= The th frequency moment of a set of frequencies \\\\mathbf{a} is defined as F_k(\\\\mathbf{a}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^k. The first moment F_1 is simply the sum of the frequencies (i.e., the total count). The second moment F_2 is useful for computing statistical properties of the data, such as the Gini coefficient of variation. F_{\\\\infty} is defined as the frequency of the most frequent item(s). The seminal paper of Alon, Matias, and Szegedy dealt with the problem of estimating the frequency moments.  Calculating Frequency Moments  A direct approach to find the frequency moments requires to maintain a register for all distinct elements which requires at least memory of order \\\\Omega(N). But we have space limitations and require an algorithm that computes in much lower memory. This can be achieved by using approximations instead of exact values. An algorithm that computes an (Œµ,Œ¥)approximation of , where is the (Œµ,Œ¥)- approximated value of . Where Œµ is the approximation parameter and Œ¥ is the confidence parameter. = Calculating F0 (Distinct Elements in a DataStream) = FM-Sketch Algorithm  Flajolet et al. in introduced probabilistic method of counting which was inspired from a paper by Robert Morris. Morris in his paper says that if the requirement of accuracy is dropped, a counter n can be replaced by a counter which can be stored in bits. Flajolet et al. in improved this method by using a hash function which is assumed to uniformly distribute the element in the hash space (a binary string of length ). :h:[m] \\\\rightarrow [0,2^{L}-1] Let represent the kth bit in binary representation of :y = \\\\sum_{k\\\\geq0} \\\\mathrm{bit}(y,k)*2^{k} Let \\\\rho(y) represents the position of least significant 1-bit in the binary representation of with a suitable convention for \\\\rho(0). :\\\\rho(y)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathrm{Min}(k:\\\\mathrm{bit}(y,k)1) &\\\\text{if } y>0 L &\\\\text{if } y=0 \\\\end{cases} Let A be the sequence of data stream of length M whose cardinality need to be determined. Let BITMAP [0...L ‚àí 1] be the hash space where the (hashedvalues) are recorded. The below algorithm then determines approximate cardinality of A. Procedure FM-Sketch: for i in 0 to L ‚àí 1 do BITMAP[i]:=0 end for for x in A: do Index:=œÅ(hash(x)) if BITMAP[index]=0 then BITMAP[index]:=1 end if end for B:= Position of left most 0 bit of BITMAP[] return 2^B If there are N distinct elements in a data stream. * For i \\\\gg \\\\log(N) then BITMAP[i] is certainly 0 * For i \\\\ll \\\\log(N) then BITMAP[i] is certainly 1 * For i \\\\approx \\\\log(N) then BITMAP[i] is a fringes of 0's and 1's  K-Minimum Value Algorithm  The previous algorithm describes the first attempt to approximate F0 in the data stream by Flajolet and Martin. Their algorithm picks a random hash function which they assume to uniformly distribute the hash values in hash space. Bar-Yossef et al. in introduced k-minimum value algorithm for determining number of distinct elements in data stream. They used a similar hash function h which can be normalized to [0,1] as h:[m] \\\\rightarrow [0,1]. But they fixed a limit t to number of values in hash space. The value of t is assumed of the order O\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\varepsilon_{2}}\\\\right) (i.e. less approximation-value Œµ requires more t). KMV algorithm keeps only t-smallest hash values in the hash space. After all the m values of stream have arrived, \\\\upsilon= \\\\mathrm{Max}(h(a_{i} )) is used to calculateF'_{0}=\\\\dfrac{t}{\\\\upsilon}. That is, in a close-to uniform hash space, they expect at-least t elements to be less than O\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{t}{F_{0}}\\\\right). Procedure 2 K-Minimum Value Initialize first t values of KMV for a in a1 to an do if h(a) < Max(KMV) then Remove Max(KMV) from KMV set Insert h(a) to KMV end if end for return t/Max(KMV)  Complexity analysis of KMV  KMV algorithm can be implemented in O\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\varepsilon_{2}}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\log(m)\\\\right) memory bits space. Each hash value requires space of order O(\\\\log(m)) memory bits. There are hash values of the order O\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\varepsilon_{2}}\\\\right). The access time can be reduced if we store the t hash values in a binary tree. Thus the time complexity will be reduced to O\\\\left(\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\log(m)\\\\right). = Calculating = Alon et al. in estimates by defining random variables that can be computed within given space and time. The expected value of random variable gives the approximate value of . Let us assume length of sequence m is known in advance. Construct a random variable X as follows: * Select be a random member of sequence with index at , a_p=l \\\\in(1,2,3,\\\\ldots,n) * Let r=\\\\\\\\{q:q\\\\geq p,a_q=l\\\\\\\\}, represents the number of occurrences of within the members of the sequence following . * Random variable X=m(r^k-(r-1)^k). Assume S1 be of the order O(n^{1-1/k}/\\\\lambda^{2}) and S2 be of the order O(\\\\log(1/\\\\varepsilon)). Algorithm takes S2 random variable Y1,Y2,...,YS2 and outputs the median Y . Where is the average of where 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ S1. Now calculate expectation of random variable . : \\\\begin{array}{lll} E(X) &=& \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m_i} (j^k-(j-1)^k)  &=& \\\\frac{m}{m} [(1^k+(2^k-1^k)+\\\\ldots+ (m_{1}^{k} - (m_{1}-1)^{k}))  &&\\\\;+\\\\; (1^k+(2^k-1^k)+\\\\ldots+ (m_{2}^{k} - (m_{2}-1)^{k}))+\\\\ldots  &&\\\\;+\\\\; (1^k+(2^k-1^k)+\\\\ldots+ (m_{n}^{k} - (m_{n}-1)^{k}))]  &=& \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i}^{k} = F_{k} \\\\end{array}  Complexity of  From the algorithm to calculate discussed above, we can see that each random variable stores value of and . So, to compute we need to maintain only bits for storing and bits for storing . Total number of random variable will be the . Hence the total space complexity the algorithm takes is of the order of O\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{k\\\\log{1 \\\\over \\\\varepsilon}}{\\\\lambda^{2}}n^{1-{1 \\\\over k}}\\\\left(\\\\log n + \\\\log m\\\\right)\\\\right)  Simpler approach to calculate  The previous algorithm calculates F_2 in order of O( \\\\sqrt{n}(\\\\log m + \\\\log n)) memory bits. Alon et al. in simplified this algorithm using four-wise independent random variable with values mapped to \\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\}. This further reduces the complexity to calculate F_2 to O\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\log{1\\\\over\\\\varepsilon}}{\\\\lambda^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\log n + \\\\log m\\\\right)\\\\right) =Frequent elements= In the data stream model, the frequent elements problem is to output a set of elements that constitute more than some fixed fraction of the stream. A special case is the majority problem, which is to determine whether or not any value constitutes a majority of the stream. More formally, fix some positive constant > 1, let the length of the stream be , and let denote the frequency of value in the stream. The frequent elements problem is to output the set {  > m/c }. Some notable algorithms are: * Boyer‚ÄìMoore majority vote algorithm * Karp-Papadimitriou-Shenker algorithm * Count-Min sketch * Sticky sampling * Lossy counting * Sample and Hold * Multi- stage Bloom filters * Count-sketch * Sketch-guided sampling * Misra‚ÄìGries summary =Event detection= Detecting events in data streams is often done using a heavy hitters algorithm as listed above: the most frequent items and their frequency are determined using one of these algorithms, then the largest increase over the previous time point is reported as trend. This approach can be refined by using exponentially weighted moving averages and variance for normalization. =Counting distinct elements= Counting the number of distinct elements in a stream (sometimes called the moment) is another problem that has been well studied. The first algorithm for it was proposed by Flajolet and Martin. In 2010, Daniel Kane, Jelani Nelson and David Woodruff found an asymptotically optimal algorithm for this problem. It uses space, with worst-case update and reporting times, as well as universal hash functions and a -wise independent hash family where . =Entropy= The (empirical) entropy of a set of frequencies \\\\mathbf{a} is defined as F_k(\\\\mathbf{a}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{a_i}{m}\\\\log{\\\\frac{a_i}{m}}, where m = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i. Estimation of this quantity in a stream has been done by: * McGregor et al. * Do Ba et al. * Lall et al. * Chakrabarti et al. =Online learning= Learn a model (e.g. a classifier) by a single pass over a training set. * Feature hashing * Stochastic gradient descent Lower bounds Lower bounds have been computed for many of the data streaming problems that have been studied. By far, the most common technique for computing these lower bounds has been using communication complexity.

Goethe wrote the poem \\"\\" as a precursor of \\"\\", while he was travelling to Lahneck Castle on the river Lahn in July 1774. Under Herder's influence, the setting was changed to the mythical island kingdom Thule, which was thought to be the northernmost place Greek seafarers ventured in antiquity. Goethe used it later in his tragedy Faust (part I, lines 2759‚Äì82) as Gretchen's (Margaret) introduction. It has been set to music by a number of composers, notably Franz Schubert.  Text  Es war ein K√∂nig in Thule, Gar treu bis an das Grab, Dem sterbend seine Buhle einen goldnen Becher gab.

Er sa√ü beim K√∂nigsmahle, Die Ritter um ihn her, Auf hohem V√§tersaale, Dort auf dem Schlo√ü am Meer. Dort stand der alte Zecher, Trank letzte Lebensglut, Und warf den heiligen Becher Hinunter in die Flut. Er sah ihn st√ºrzen, trinken Und sinken tief ins Meer, die Augen t√§ten ihm sinken, Trank nie einen Tropfen mehr There was a king in Thule, Was faithful till the grave, To whom his mistress, dying, A golden goblet gave. Nought was to him more precious; He drained it at every bout; His eyes with tears ran over, As oft as he drank thereout. When came his time of dying, The towns in his land he told, Nought else to his heir denying Except the goblet of gold. He sat at the royal banquet With his knights of high degree, In the lofty hall of his fathers In the castle by the sea. There stood the old carouser, And drank the last life-glow; And hurled the hallowed goblet Into the tide below. He saw it plunging and filling, And sinking deep in the sea: Then fell his eyelids for ever, And never more drank he!Translation by Bayard Taylor in The Works of J.

S. Bach's Mass in B minor in Britain. The choir has around 220 active members. Directed by David Hill MBE (BBC Singers/Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra), one of the country's most eminent choral directors, it regularly performs and records across London and the UK, including at the Royal Albert Hall and Abbey Road Studios. The choir's patron is The Prince of Wales. Its conductor laureate was Sir David Willcocks, who was the choir's musical director from 1960‚Äì1998. Its other musical directors have included Sir Charles Villiers Stanford, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Reginald Jacques. In 2013, John Rutter was appointed president of the choir, following the death of Leopold David de Rothschild in 2012. Its vice presidents are Dame Janet Baker, James Bowman, Dame Felicity Lott and Sam Gordon Clark. The Bach Choir has recorded extensively, and performed for many film scores. In recent years, it has been heard in the feature films Kingdom of Heaven, Prometheus, Robin Hood, The Chronicles of Narnia, Shrek the Third, and Jack the Giant Slayer. In 2011, it collaborated with John Rutter and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on The Colours of Christmas, which reached No 3 in the Official Classical Charts. In 2013, it also worked on projects for BBC Radio 3, BBC One, Sky Arts and Sky Sports News. The choir's relationship with classical label Naxos Records, developed under current Musical Director David Hill, has led to many acclaimed releases, including Howells' Stabat Mater; Vaughan Williams's Dona Nobis Pacem / Sancta Civitas (2010), which received a Gramophone award nomination; and Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life, which received a coveted Choc de Classica from French classical magazine Classica, and was named Album of the Week by The Sunday Times and The Telegraph. Early years Formed in 1875 for the purpose of giving the first complete British performance of J. S. Bach's Mass in B minor,The first known complete performance had been given in Leipzig by the Riedel-Verein on 10 April 1859. See \\"Bach's Greatest Enigma - The Mass in B minor\\", BBC Radio 3, accessed 19 June 2011. Sections of the score had been given in Britain under conductors including John Hullah before 1876, but this was the first complete performance in Britain: see \\"Bach's Mass in B Minor\\", The Times, 11 May 1876, p. 5 the Bach Choir continued and developed to become one of the world's leading amateur choirs. The original idea for the choir came from Arthur Duke Coleridge, a young lawyer and outstanding amateur tenor who became acquainted with the Mass while a student at Leipzig, where he studied music along with the young Charles Villiers Stanford.Elkins, p. 62 He formed a committee to promote a British performance of the Mass, recruiting George Grove and John Stainer to serve on it. They appointed as musical director Otto Goldschmidt, the husband of Jenny Lind (the \\"Swedish Nightingale\\") who, as a former pupil of Felix Mendelssohn in Leipzig, had a good knowledge of the music of Bach. Within six months a choir was assembled and two performances of the Mass, conducted by Goldschmidt, were given on 26 April and 8 May 1876. The concerts's success encouraged the formation of a permanent choir with Goldschmidt as its first musical director. The choir's declared aim was \\"the practice and performance of choral works of excellence and of various schools\\". Initially, members were drawn exclusively from the upper levels of Victorian society, the social stratum in which Coleridge and Goldschmidt moved. Among the singing members was Princess Christian, the fifth child of Queen Victoria;Webb, Stanley. \\"A Century of Bach\\", The Musical Times Vol. 117, No. 1597 (March 1976), pp. 225‚Äì227 and among the founder-members, W.E. Gladstone. This exclusivity was perpetuated as recruits had to be proposed and seconded by existing members and approved by the committee. Of greater concern for the choir's future health, however, were the lack of a requirement for regular re-audition, and a five o'clock rehearsal time. While the latter ensured that members's evening social lives were not disturbed, rehearsal attendance by tenors and basses with business interests soon became a cause for concern. A positive feature of the wealthy membership, however, was that programming could be more adventurous without the need to resort to performances of the popular oratorio repertoire to secure essential funds. The repertoire in the Goldschmidt years was biased towards motets and Renaissance church music, a reflection of his particular interests; but the connection with Bach was maintained by regular performances of the Mass in B Minor and some of the cantatas. Goldschmidt resigned in 1885 to be replaced by Stanford, organist of Trinity College, Cambridge and conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society, who had recently been appointed professor of composition at the Royal College of Music. Stanford expanded the repertoire with programmes which included the Brahms Requiem, excerpts from Parsifal, the Verdi Requiem and other contemporary works. The choir always had connections with royalty, and Queen Victoria became patron in 1879. To mark her golden jubilee in 1887, the choir invited Hubert Parry to compose its first commissioned work, the choral ode Blest Pair of Sirens.  20th century  By the end of the 19th century, the choir faced a crisis. Deteriorating performance standards‚Äîdue primarily to an ageing membership not subject to re- audition, and inadequate rehearsal time‚Äîproduced mounting financial losses. Membership was opened to all social groups, and regular re-tests for existing members were implemented. Stanford resigned in 1902 to take up the conductorship of the Leeds Festival. He was replaced by Henry Walford Davies, who rebuilt the choir, then handed it over to Hugh Allen in 1907. Allen inherited a choir that included Ralph Vaughan Williams and later Adrian Boult among its singing members. He had already gained a reputation as a choral conductor at Ely and Oxford, and brought immense energy to the task. Under him a number of first London performances were given, including Toward the Unknown Region and A Sea Symphony. He steered the choir through the difficult years of the First World War; and in 1916, presided over the first performance of Parry's Songs of Farewell. The growing pressure of Allen's commitments obliged him to resign in 1921, to be succeeded by Vaughan Williams. While he remained faithful to the tradition of the performance of Bach‚Äîin particular, the St Matthew Passion‚ÄîVaughn Williams also gave audiences opportunities to hear works by contemporary composers, including his good friend Gustav Holst; and in 1926 he conducted the choir in the first London performance of his oratorio Sancta Civitas. In October 1927, the start of the 1927/28 season, Vaughan Williams announced his intention to resign to concentrate on composing. He gave a season's notice, giving the choir what was considered ample time to find a replacement. Probably at Vaughan Williams' prompting, the choir approached Holst, who had established a reputation as a first-rate choral trainer and teacher as director of music at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, and at Morley College. Holst confirmed his acceptance by letter on 16 December 1927, and it was arranged for him to start at the beginning of the new season in October 1928. By May 1928, however, his health had deteriorated, requiring him to withdraw his acceptance. With a new season fast approaching, the choir was in trouble. Malcom Sargent was approached; he was interested in the role, but negotiations broke down over his insistence on using deputy choirmasters to take rehearsals that conflicted with his other engagements. Many choir members were already lobbying for Adrian Boult (who believed the musical director should take all rehearsals); and, following the breakdown of negotiations with Sargent, he was approached. Although he was already heavily committed, Boult accepted the appointment; and in June 1928, the handover from Vaughan Williams (who was elected a Vice-President of the choir) was finalised at the July 1928 AGM.Keen, Dr Basil, The Bach Choir: The First Hundred Years Although only in charge for four seasons, Boult produced performances of high quality, and introduced challenging contemporary works. His lasting legacy was to initiate annual complete performances of the St Matthew Passion in English, a tradition that continues to this day.Canning, Hugh. \\"Crimes against Passions ‚Äì Music\\", The Sunday Times, 11 April 1999 Boult was followed in 1932 by Reginald Jacques, who had been a pupil of Hugh Allen at Oxford. In a stay of twenty-eight years he introduced the traditional annual Carol Concert, ensured that activities continued without a break during the Second World War, and in 1947-48 conducted the choir in its first recording ‚Äì a somewhat abridged performance of the St Matthew Passion with Kathleen Ferrier as the contralto soloist. Despite several movements of the piece being cut, the recording still filled forty-two sides of the old style 78 rpm discs. Ferrier had made her debut in Messiah with the choir in 1943. Following the sudden departure of Jacques in 1960 after a heart attack, the musical directorship went to David Willcocks, director of music at King's College, Cambridge. He was soon pointing the choir in new directions, introducing important contemporary works including Honegger's King David, Delius's Sea Drift and Jan√°ƒçek's Glagolitic MassÔøºÔøº. He undertook a number of recordings, most notably a performance of Britten's War Requiem conducted by the composer, which sold 200,000 copies in its first five months. A series of foreign tours was also arranged to the United States, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, France, Sweden and South Africa. The choir gave the Italian premiere of the War Requiem at La Scala, Milan. In 1968, the choir performed on the Rolling Stones song \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", with a choral arrangement by Jack Nitzsche. Among the choir's conductors in the later part of the 20th century were Pierre Monteux (under whom it performed and recorded Beethoven's Ninth Symphony), Jascha Horenstein, Lorin Maazel and David Oistrakh. Willcocks retired in 1998 after thirty-eight years in charge.\\"Music ‚Äì Monday evenings will never be the same again\\", The Independent 13 March 1998 The current musical director, David Hill MBE, was appointed in 1998, coming from a background of appointments as organist and master of the music at Winchester Cathedral and musical director of St John's College, Cambridge.

Combat Stress makes available treatment for all Veterans who are suffering with mental illness free of charge. On average, it takes 13 years for a Veteran to first contact with Combat Stress for advice, help, and treatment; however for those who served in Iraq (Gulf War I and Gulf War II) and Afghanistan, the time period is much lower. The charity was formed in 1919, as the Ex-Servicemen's Welfare Society, following World War I; when the effects of shell shock were becoming known. History before 1919World War I= Soldiers (and other frontline personnel) returning home from World War I suffered greatly from the horrors of war that they had witnessed. Many returning veterans suffered from what was then known as shell shock; now known as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In 1915, the British Army in France was instructed that: In August 1916, Charles Myers was made Consulting Psychologist to the Army. He hammered home the notion that it was necessary to create special centres near the line using treatment based on: *Promptness of action; *Suitable environment; *Psychotherapeutic measures. He also used hypnosis with limited success. In December 1916, Gordon Holmes was put in charge of the northern, and more important, part of the western front. He had much more of the tough attitudes of the Army, and suited the prevailing military mindset, and so his view prevailed. By June 1917, all British cases of 'shell-shock' were evacuated to a nearby neurological centre, and were labelled as NYDN ‚Äì 'not yet diagnosed nervous'. \\"But, because of the Adjutant-General's distrust of doctors, no patient could receive that specialist attention until Form AF 3436 had been sent off to the man‚Äôs unit and filled in by his commanding officer.\\" This created significant delays, but demonstrated that between 4-10% of shell- shock W cases were 'commotional' (due to physical causes), and the rest were 'emotional'. This killed off shell-shock as a valid disease, and it was abolished in September 1918. During the war, 306 British soldiers were executed for cowardice; many of whom were victims of shell shock. On 7 November 2006, the Government of the United Kingdom gave them all a posthumous conditional pardon. The Shot at Dawn Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire commemorates these men. Present work Combat Stress announce as of 27th January 2020 due to a shortage of funds they will not accept any further referrals for treatment in England and Wales (https://www.combatstress.org.uk/service-redesign-announcement). Combat Stress was formed at a time when there was little known about mental health problems affecting ex-Service men and women who had returned home after serving in war and conflict zones. Currently, the organisation is helping almost 6,000 people who are Veterans aged from 19 to 97.

It is close to the geographical centre of Salisbury Plain, on the A360 road approximately midway between the villages of Shrewton and Market Lavington, and is near the source of the River Till. Its population in 2011 was 358, down from a peak of 989 inhabitants in 1951. History Salisbury Plain has much evidence of prehistoric activity. One kilometre south of Tilshead village, under the ridge of Copehill Down, is the White Barrow, a large Neolithic long barrow. To the southwest and southeast are ancient boundary ditches, partly followed by the parish boundary; the ditch in the southeast has a long barrow next to it. In 1086, Tydolveshyde or Tidolthide was a borough and large royal estate, and had a relatively large population of 164 households. The tithing of South Tilshead was a manor of Romsey Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries, and came to be a detached part of the hundred of Whorwellsdown. The village has houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, some thatched. Tilshead House, on the High Street, is a three-storey house of the early 19th century, in red brick. Tilshead Lodge was built in the early 18th century to the southwest of the village, then rebuilt c. 1800. The estate was used for racehorse training in the early 19th and early 20th centuries, then was sold to the War Office in 1911 and 1933. The house was demolished sometime after 1957. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Religious sites Parish church = Church of St Thomas √† Becket There was a church at Tilshead in the early 12th century, possibly since Saxon times. The three-bay north and south arcades with their square piers are from that period, and the font bowl is also from that century. The chancel was rebuilt in the mid-13th century, and were renovations in the 17th and 18th centuries included re-roofing it. T.H. Wyatt and D. Brandon directed restoration in 1845-6 which added the south porch and north vestry, and there was further work in 1904. The church is built in flint and limestone, partly chequered, and has a low central tower with a small conical roof; it was recorded as Grade I listed in 1958. The three bells were cast in 1764 by Thomas Bilbie I. Income from the church went to Ivychurch Priory near Salisbury from 1317. The dedication to St Thomas is first recorded in 1763; it may come from the link with Ivychurch, as it is thought that the saint stayed at the priory during the Council of Clarendon in 1164. A plain- fronted vicarage was built in red brick to the west of the church in 1818, and sold c.1972. In 1971 the benefice was united with those of Chitterne and Orcheston. Today the parish forms part of the Salisbury Plain benefice, which also encompasses the churches at Shrewton. = Others = A small redbrick Baptist chapel was built next to the main road in 1882 and closed in 2015.  Amenities  Tilshead has a primary school, St Thomas √† Becket C of E (Aided) Primary School, which was built next to the church in 1905. There is a pub ‚Äì the Rose and Crown, a 17th-century building ‚Äì and a village hall. The whole length of the River Till (which is a winterbourne, dry for much of the year) is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Military land Much of Salisbury Plain is used by the Ministry of Defence for military training. Westdown Camp, to the east of the village, is an accommodation centre for the Salisbury Plain Training Area. RAF Tilshead, to the southwest of the village, was in use from 1925 to 1941.

In 1960, while at IBM, Parry invented the magnetic stripe card for use by the U.S. Government. He had the idea of gluing short pieces of magnetic tape to each plastic card, but the glue warped the tape, making it unusable. When he returned home, Parry's wife Dorothea was using a flat iron to iron clothes. When he explained his inability to get the tape to \\"stick\\" to the plastic in a way that would work, she suggested that he use the iron to melt the stripe onto the card. He tried it and it worked. The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card. Magnetic stripes are now used on credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, stored-value cards, hotel keycards, and security identification badges. Publications of Forrest Parry * F. C.

It also flows through Shrewton and Winterbourne Stoke. It has been designated as a SSSI site. The name ‚ÄòRiver Till‚Äô is a double misnomer, firstly because this is not a river but a winterbourne ‚Äì i.e. a winter stream that only flows for approximately three months in a year. Secondly because the name ‚ÄòTill‚Äô is a Victorian misunderstanding. At some point the false leap of logic was made that because the winterbourne flows from the village of Tilshead this meant it was the head of the Till. In fact Tilshead arises from Tydolfshide, i.e. the hide of land belonging to Tydolf. Even as recently as the early 20th century the winterbourne was known, in Shrewton at least, as ‚Äòthe Waterlake‚Äô, rather than the Till.

The parish is west of Norwich, south-south-west of King's Lynn and north of London. The nearest town is Downham Market which is north east of the parish. The nearest railway station is at Downham Market for the Fen Line which runs between King's Lynn and Cambridge. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. The parish of Downham West, in the 2001 census, has a population of 285, rising marginally to 286 at the Census 2011. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. Description West Downham is a small Fenland parish in the west of the county of Norfolk. There is no village called West Downham within the parish, only a small hamlet which is called Salters Lode. The hamlet is strung out along the A1122 roadCounty A to Z Atlas, Street & Road maps Norfolk, that hugs the drains and the course of the Great Ouse river, and consist of a few isolated farms standing out in the Fen. The name of Downham comes from the Old English meaning 'homestead on a hill',Dictionary of English Place-Names: By A D Mills (Oxford, Oxford University Press) and West designation from the direction from nearby Downham Market. Salters Lode derives its name the Old English meaning 'place where salt is kept', and 'watercourse or drainage channel'. Salters Lode The hamlet of Salters Lode is scattered around a lock at the end of the Well Creek navigation. Well Creek is part of the Middle-Level system and on the route that forms a navigation link between the river Nene and river Great Ouse. =History= During the period that the area was occupied by the Romans Salters Lode became an important part of the salt industry on the Fen edge. A Roman road called the Fen Causeway which ran through the Fens to Ermine Street at Peterborough, passed through the parish of Downham West on a strip of silt that rises above the level of the peat. With the proximity of this road, salt working became an important industry in this area and giving rise to the hamlet's name. In 1993 the Norfolk Archaeological Unit discovered the site of a Roman salt works in West Downham dating to the 3rd and the 4th centuries. The excavations revealed a series of enclosures, structures and turbaries along with a ditched Roman field system and what was once a Roman canal. The archaeologist also found Roman coins and pottery. This evidence has led to the conclusion that there had been Roman settlement and industrial activity of a substantial level in the area. =Salters Lode Lock= The lock is managed and owned by the Middle Level Commissioners inland drainage authority. This authority is responsible for the middle-level network of drains, primarily for land drainage in the area, but also the navigation link between the two rivers. Salters Lode lock is part of the Denver complex which makes up the main gateway onto the Great Ouse navigation system from the tidal river. The Denver complex consists of a number of locks and sluices that are used for navigation access and management of water levels on the numerous waterways that characterise this part of The Fens. =Salters Lode smockmill= The Ordnance Survey map of 1836Ordnance Survey. 1824-1836. Ordnance Survey First Edition 1 inch has the position of Salters Lode smockmill located on land between what is now the A1122 road and where Well Creek and the River Great Ouse converge. This mill began life as a drainage mill built by Drainage Commissioners, but was converted into a corn mill around c.1850. Norfolkmills/Salters Lode Smockmill The mill had three pairs of stones which were driven by one pair of single-shuttered patent sails and one pair of common sails. The mill stood four-storeys high with the first being the base which was octagonal and constructed from brick. The main body of the mill was constructed of tarred vertical weatherboarding. At the top of the mill was a boat-shaped cap. There was no fantail and a tailpole with steps on each side was used to turn the mill into the wind. The mill ceased working in 1924 and was standing in a derelict state in 1949. Today there is no evidence of the mill to be seen.

He provided bass guitar and backing vocals for pop rockers, Skyhooks from 1973 to 1980 and subsequently for various reformations. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"Macainsh's biting, provocative songs were the perfect expression of adolescent obsessions and frustrations. With those songs, the band made an enormous impact on Australian social life.\\" Macainsh became an intellectual property lawyer.  Biography  Gregory John Macainsh was born on 30 December 1950 and grew up in Warrandyte. His father was a some-time poet and his mother was a librarian. He attended Norwood High School, Ringwood and recalled attending a scouting jamboree when he heard the Beatles on the radio. \\"It was wild stuff, amazing. I lost interest in the scouts and concentrated on music. The little tranny had just hit. I listened to a valve radio at home and then to a crystal radio set I made for my bedroom. 3UZ was the station and Stan Rofe was the man.\\" In 1966 with Macainsh on bass guitar and school mate, Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks on lead vocals, he formed a group, Spare Parts. It was followed by Sound Pump two years later; Macainsh then formed Reuben Tice in Eltham, with Tony Williams on vocals. One of their songs, written by Macainsh, was \\"I Went Down to Eltham to Get Me a Job in a Band\\". By 1970 Macainsh was back with Strauks, who was now on drums, first in Claptrap and by 1971 in Frame, which had Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan as lead vocalist. The line-up also included Pat O'Brien and Cynthio Ooms on guitars. Australian rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll observed, \\"[Reuben Tice were] a local group that hardly ever ventured out of its alternate lifestyle Eltham area, [Frame were] a group that looked for gigs in inner suburban Melbourne.\\" In March 1973 Macainsh on bass guitar, backing vocals and as main songwriter, and Strauks on drums and backing vocals, formed Skyhooks in Melbourne as a glam rock, pop rock group. Other founders were Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Inglis on guitar (ex-the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), and Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (ex- Lipp & the Double Dekker Brothers). By August Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie (ex-Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother, Peter Starkie, and Inglis was replaced by Red Symons (ex-Scumbag) on guitar, vocals and keyboards. Ross Wilson (ex-Daddy Cool) caught one of their early gigs and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. Late in that year they were signed to Michael Gudinski's booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to his label, Mushroom Records. The group recorded two live tracks, \\"Hey What's the Matter\\" (written by Macainsh) and \\"Love on the Radio\\" (co-written by Macainsh and Hill), during their performance at the Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1974. These tracks appeared on Mushroom Record's various artists' live album, Highlights of Sunbury '74 (1974). In June 1974, three months after Strachan had replaced Hill, Skyhooks recorded their debut album, Living in the 70's (October 1974), with nine of its ten tracks written by Macainsh. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"Macainsh's biting, provocative songs were the perfect expression of adolescent obsessions and frustrations. With those songs, the band made an enormous impact on Australian social life.\\" The album spent 16 weeks at the top of the Kent Music Report Albums Chart from late February 1975, and became the highest-selling album by an Australian act until that time, with shipment of 240,000 copies. In October 2010 it was listed at No. 9 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Ego Is Not a Dirty Word (July 1975), Skyhooks' second album, spent 11 weeks at the number-one spot and shipped 180,000 copies. Of its ten tracks Macainsh wrote eight and co-wrote another with former member, Hill. Nimmervoll opined, \\"With two of the biggest selling Australian albums of all time to their credit, the band put everything into the most elaborated stage settings Australia had ever seen. Everything Skyhooks did put Australian music on a level never seen before.\\" Macainsh's then girlfriend, Jenny Brown, described the band in her 1975 book, Skyhooks : Million Dollar Riff. He remained with the group until it disbanded in 1980. =After Skyhooks= Macainsh has participated in Skyhooks reunions in 1983, 1984, 1990 and 1994. After Skyhooks, he played with John Farnham on his Whispering Jack Tour in 1986‚Äì87 and appears in the music video for Farnham's single, \\"You're the Voice\\" (1986). According to Farnham's manager, Glenn Wheatley, \\"[the video] was done on a shoestring budget. I called in Derryn and Jacki, some of the guys from Pseudo Echo (James and Vince Leigh) and Greg Macainsh from Skyhooks are in the band, it was pretty much anyone who'd do me a favour.\\" Macainsh later worked with Dave Warner's from the Suburbs. In 1988 he put together and managed an AC/DC tribute band, Back in Black, which supported Skyhooks on a reunion tour. He was a board member of Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) (1997‚Äì2000) and Phonographic Performance Company of Australia (PPCA) (2001‚Äì06), and is an intellectual property lawyer.

The soundtrack album spent nine weeks at number one. Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top- performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2009, 16 different albums topped the chart; placings were based on electronic point of sale data from retail outlets. Unusually, the year began and ended with the same album at number one. In the issue of Billboard dated January 3, 19-year-old singer Taylor Swift's album Fearless spent its sixth week in the top spot. The album held the top spot for 13 of the first 14 weeks of 2009. Later in the year, the album experienced a resurgence in its chart performance, returning to number one in the issue dated August 1. It returned to the top spot periodically for the remainder of the year, and in the issue dated December 26 spent its 29th week atop the chart. The album also topped the all-genre Billboard 200 for 11 weeks, and won a number of awards, including the Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Country Album. It was 2009's biggest-selling album in the U.S. and would eventually be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping more than 10 million units. After Fearless, the album which spent the most time at number one on the Top Country Albums chart in 2009 was the soundtrack album of the film Hannah Montana: The Movie, starring 16-year-old actress/singer Miley Cyrus, who performed most of the tracks. The album spent nine non-consecutive weeks atop the chart, interrupted for a single week by Kenny Chesney's Greatest Hits II. In contrast to teen stars Swift and Cyrus, George Strait topped the chart at the age of 57 with Twang. It was the 23rd number one for the singer, who had first reached the peak position with Right or Wrong more than 25 years earlier and achieved regular chart-toppers ever since. Strait's album was displaced from number one by Keep On Loving You by Reba McEntire, another veteran country star who had been achieving chart-toppers since the 1980s. It was the 11th number one for McEntire, breaking the record for the most chart-topping country albums by a female artist which she had previously shared with Loretta Lynn. Chart history Taylor Swift's album Fearless both began and ended the year at number one. George Strait continued his run of number ones, more than 25 years after he first reached the top spot. Reba McEntire set a new record in 2009 for the highest number of chart-topping albums by a female artist.

Oil companies drilled five wells in Atlantic Florida state waters and 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. None of the wells were completed as producing wells. All the leases have now reverted to the government. U.S. Atlantic coast federal offshore areas (Minerals Management Service) Although no oil or gas have been produced from beneath U.S. Atlantic waters, there are active offshore fields to the south in offshore Cuba and to the north in offshore Canada. Each US state along the Atlantic coast owns as territorial waters out to three nautical miles (3.45 statute, or land miles) from the shore at mean low tide, and has jurisdiction to decide whether or not, and under what terms, to lease the territory for oil and gas. The federal government owns and controls the minerals between three and from the shore. In accordance with congressional restrictions and presidential orders, no federal leasing has taken place on the offshore Atlantic coast of the United States since the early 1980s. The federal government had scheduled a lease sale for offshore Virginia, to take place in 2011, and in March 2010, President Barack Obama announced his intention to open the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas to oil and gas exploration.John M.

Unlike the offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which occurs in both state and federal waters, the proposed offshore Virginia drilling would be exclusively in Federal waters more than from the coast, and the state has not leased its state waters for drilling.

The village is on the River Till just above its confluence with the River Wylye. The village is on the B3083 road, which joins the A36 at the southern end of the village. The parish includes the hamlet of Serrington, on the A36 west of the B3083 junction.  History  The Domesday survey of 1086 recorded an estate held by Swein at Stapleford, with 28 households. The manor passed to the Hussey family; in part, from the late 14th century the Sturmy family and then the Seymours, including John Seymour (1474‚Äì1536), father of Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife. Land remained in Seymour ownership until the 1940s. Other land passed to the Giffards in the 14th century, and through the Mautravers, in 1405 to the Earls of Arundel, then from 1580 various owners including Sir Richard Grobham Howe, 2nd Baronet, the Barons Chedworth and (from 1808 until c.1896) the Barons Ashburton. By the Till to the north are the earthwork remains of Stapleford Castle, a medieval ringwork and bailey castle. Until at least the 1890s, two more settlement names were shown on maps of the parish. Over Street, on the opposite bank from Stapleford, is now considered part of the village; Uppington, on the east bank to the north, now has only a small number of houses. The parish population peaked in the 19th century, with 337 recorded at the 1831 census; from 1861 to 2011, census returns have not exceeded 300.  Parish church  St Mary' Church There was a church at Stapleford in the early 12th century, belonging to Salisbury Cathedral. The parish church of St Mary is built in chalk ashlar and flint, and 12th-century work is found in the north and west walls of the nave, the south arcade, and the west wall of the aisle. The chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century and the north tower was added c. 1300\\\\. There is a 13th-century north chapel and 14th-century south chapel. The clerestory was inserted in the 15th century, and the upper stage of the tower rebuilt in 1674. Two of the six bells in the tower were cast in 1655. Restoration in 1861 by William Slater included partial rebuilding of the nave; stained glass by Clayton and Bell was installed in the tower in 1862. The chancel was restored in 1869. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1960. Pevsner writes: \\"The Norman contributions make the church memorable, especially the tremendous round piers of the south arcade. They are nearly 3ft in diameter.\\" The stone font is also 12th-century, though on a later base. The benefice was united with that of Berwick St James in 1924, and in 1992 the parish became part of the Lower Wylye and Till Valley benefice, which today covers eight rural churches. Amenities There is a village hall and a pub/restaurant, the Pelican Inn on the A36 at Serrington. The Monarch's Way long-distance footpath crosses Chain Hill, east of the village. Notable people Henry Bennett pioneered rose hybridisation at Manor Farm, Stapleford between 1865 and 1880. Harold Ridley (1906‚Äì2001), eye surgeon and inventor of the plastic lens to treat cataract, lived in the village later in life. The artist Leslie Gibson lived and worked at Stapleford from 1950 until his death in 1969.

He became a Somdet Chao Phraya -- the highest rank a Siamese noble had attained during the Rattanakosin Era, with honor equal to that of royalty.http://www.bunnag.in.th/history6-ditbunnag.html He was known colloquially as Somdet Chao Phraya Ong Yai (). He was also known as Chao Phraya Phraklang () or Minister of Trade and dominated Western affairs of Siam during the reign of King Rama III. He hold the post of Samuha Kalahom () the Prime Minister of Southern Siam from 1830 to 1855. Life Tish Bunnag was born in 1788 to Bunnag and Chao Kun Nuan (who was Queen Amarindra's sister) at his father's residence off the southern side of the Grand Palace Wall near modern Wat Pho. His father, Bunnag, or Chao Phraya Akkamahasena (), had served as Samuha Kalahom the Prime Minister of Southern Siam during the reign of King Phutthayotfa Chulalok.http://www.bsru.ac.th/th/page/about-bsru/history- somdejchaopraya.html Tish had an younger brother Tat who later became Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Pichaiyat. Prayurawongse was a member of Bunnag family who descended from Sheikh Ahmad, a Persian minister during the reign of King Prasat Thong (His lineage had converted to Theravada Buddhism in mid- eighteenth century.). Tish entered the palace as one of the royal pages - the traditional way to Siamese bureaucracy. He rose through ranks as one of the royal pages of King Phutthaloetla Naphalai. In 1818, the Grand Palace expanded south and the Bunnags moved to new residence on the West bank of Chao Phraya River in the old Chinatown of Thonburi (modern Thonburi District). In 1819, Carlos Manoel de Silveira, Portuguese delegate from Macau, arrived in Bangkok and established first Western contact of Rattakosin period. Tish was in charge of the receiving Portuguese envoys. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II of Kedah turned against Siamese domination culminating in Siamese invasion of Kedah in 1821. Siamese forces took Alor Setar and Siam took direct control over Kedah. The British on the island of Penang, which had been leased by Kedah to the British in 1786, suspected the Siamese invasion of Penang. Marquess of Hastings, the Governor-General of India, sent John Crawfurd to Bangkok in April 1821. Tish was assigned to deal with Crawfurd mission. Tish gave a place near his home in Thonburi for Crawfurd to reside. After the Crawfurd mission, Tish was made Chao Phraya Phraklang the Minister of Trade. In November 1825, Henry Burney arrived in Bangkok. Phraklang was one of three Siamese delegates who took part in the conclusion of Burney Treaty in June 1826. In 1828, Phraklang commissioned the construction of Wat Prayurawongsawas in the vicinity of his residence in Thonburi's former Chinatown. In 1830, King Rama III proposed to elevate Phraklang to the post of Samuha Kalahom. Phraklang refused, saying that the holder of the title of Chao Phraya Mahasena usually \\"passed away prematurely\\". King Rama III then assigned the post of Samuha Kalahom to Phraklang without officially investing him with the title. Phraklang then became responsible in both Kalahom (Southern Siam) and the Kromma Tha Ministry of Trade. In 1831, Tunku Kudin, nephew of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II, staged a revolt in Kedah, took control of Alor Setar and was joined by Patani. King Rama III assigned Phraklang to put down rebellions in Kedah and Patani. Both sultans of Kelantan and Terengganu sent forces to support Patani. Phraklang arrived at Songkhla in March 1832 and Chao Phraya Nakhon Noi the governor of Ligor had already taken Alor Setar so Phraklang went on to take Patani. Tuan Sulung the governor of Pattani fled to Kelantan. When Phraklang had pursued Tuan Sulung to Kelantan, Sultan Muhammad I of Kelantan, who was a relative of Tuan Sulung, surrendered and gave Tuan Sulung to Siamese authority. Sultan Abdul Rahman of Terengganu, however, refused to submit. Phraklang then obtained a royal permission to depose Sultan Abdul Rahman and installed Omar Riayat Shah, who had been residing on Lingga Island, as the new Sultan of Terengganu. Edmund Roberts led an American mission to Bangkok in March 1833. Roberts handed the letters of President Andrew Jackson to Phraklang and took residence in Phraklang's estate in Thonburi. This led to the conclusion of Siamese‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Amity and Commerce in April. During the Siamese-Vietnamese Wars, in 1833, Phraklang led the Siamese fleet with the aim to attack Saigon. Phraklang quickly took H√† Ti√™n and proceeded through Vƒ©nh T·∫ø Canal to take Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc. Phraklang was joined at Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc by Chao Phraya Bodindecha who led land armies. Both Phraklang and Bodindecha marched along the Bassac River towards Saigon and met Vietnamese fleet at V√†m Nao. During the battle of V√†m Nao, the Siamese fleet refused to engage with Vietnamese vessels, even though Phraklang himself had personally boarded a small boat to urge his fleet to attack. Phraklang and the Siamese fleet retreated to Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc, H√† Ti√™n and eventually to Chantaburi. In March 1847, the Teochew societies, known as T≈ça Hia, of Samut Sakhon rose in rebellion and kill one of the royal guards. Phraklang and his son Kham marched royal guard regiment to subjugate the Chinese at Samut Sakhon. Next month in April, another Teochew insurrection occurred at Chacheongsao and the governor of Chacheongsao was killed. Phraklang then had his son Kham guarded Samut Sakhon and himself led another force to put down the Chinese rebellion in Chacheongsao with his another son Chuang. Phraklang met Bodindecha, who had been returning from Cambodia, again at Chacheongsao. After the rebellions had been over, they both returned to Bangkok. \\"Solar-charioteer\\" Seal of the Office of Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse, granted by King Mongkut in 1851. With the demise of Chao Phraya Bodindecha in 1849, Phraklang became the most powerful political figure in court. Phraklang had played a great role in the ascension of King Mongkut. In 1851, King Mongkut bestowed Phraklang with the title of Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse and became Mongkut's regent kingdom-wide along with his brother Phraya Sripipat who became Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Pichaiyat and Mongkut's regent in Bangkok. Prayurawongse's honor was equal to that of a prince. Prayurawongse was granted the right to use the Solar-charioteer Seal () To distinguish him from his brother, Prayurawongse was known colloquially as \\"Somdet Chao Phraya Ong Yai\\" ( \\"The Elder Somdet Chao Phraya\\") while his brother was called the \\"Somdet Chao Phraya Ong Noi\\" ( \\"The Younger Somdet Chao Phraya\\"). During the reign of King Mongkut, Prayurawongse officially held the post of both Samuha Kalahom and Kromma Tha. However, the de facto duties were already distributed to his sons. His son Chuang, who was made Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse (later Somdet Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse), was the deputy of Kalahom. His another son Kham was deputy of Kromma Tha (he was later made Chao Phraya Thipakornwongse) the Ministry of Trade. Prayurawongse was one of the plenipotentiaries during the negotiation of the Bowring Treaty in April 1855. Bowring had demanded free trade and to end the monopoly of Siamese royal court in Western trade. Prayurawongse had vehemently opposed British proposals but through the mediation of his son Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse the Bowring Treaty was concluded and free trade was established. A month after the Bowring Treaty, Prayurawongse died at his residence near Wat Prayurawongse in modern Thonburi District on 26 April 1855, aged 67. His funeral and cremation were held in the manner and ceremonies of royalty at Wat Prayurawongse in October 1855. His sons and descendants continued to dominate Siamese politics in the later part of nineteenth century. Family and Issues Prayurawongse had many wives, in accordance to contemporary social practices. His main wife was Lady Chan who was a daughter of Phraya Pollathep Thongin. Princess Praphaiwadi (daughter of King Rama I and sister to King Rama II) had given two of her ladies-in-waitings Lady Rod and Lady Inyai to be Prayurawongse's wives. Queen Sri Suriyendra had given Lady Peung to be his wife. He had total of twenty- four wives and forty-four children. His notable sons included; * Chuang Bunnag, born to Lady Chan, later became Somdet Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse (1808 - 1882). Succeeded his father as Samuha Kalahom in 1855.

He has a PhD in physics, (Barcelona, 1988) and a PhD in philosophy (Rome, 1992). He is professor at the University San Pablo CEU (Madrid), and at the John Paul II Institute (Madrid), member of the Jaques Maritain International Institute, and distinguished guest professor at Galileo University (2007, Guatemala). In 2007, he became an honorary professor at the Institute of Family Sciences (Guatemala) for his contribution to family sciences through his anthropology studies. From his active dedication to the investigation and diffusion of Personalist philosophy, Burgos has been a guest professor at universities in Rome, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Guatemala and Colombia. He is founder and actual president of the Spanish Association of Personalism (Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Personalismo , AEP), an institution dedicated to develop and promote personalism through publications , seminaries and international congresses on personalist thinkers such as Karol Wojty≈Ça(2006 ) and Juli√°n Mar√≠as (2008 ). The editor of two philosophy collections (Palabra Editorials, Madrid Spain) has also published numerous books and articles on specialized magazines on diverse topics on Personalism, Philosophical Anthropology, Bioethics and sociology of the family. Thought Burgos's philosophy, takes off from the originality and intellectual weight of Personalism with names like Maritain, Emmanuel Mounier, Wojty≈Ça, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Scheler, Mar√≠as, Guardini, Nedoncelle, Gabriel Marcel, etc. His investigation focuses on three main subjects: * He has identified the main authors of this philosophy (El personalismo, 2003), * He has developed specific studies on Maritain (Para comprender a Jacques Maritain, 2006), Wojty≈Ça (La filosofia personalista de Karol Wojty≈Ça, 2007) and Mar√≠as (El vuelo del alci√≥n, 2009) and, * He has also synthesized the intellectual keys of Personalism, establishing a framework or matrix that grasps the unity of this stream of thought to enable its progress and development (Hacia una definici√≥n de la filosof√≠a personalista, 2006). The result of his synthesis labor is presented in two major phases: In the first one, he states the elements that place personalism within the Realistic Classical philosophy. In his analysis, this standing point supposes six basic principles: * The world is viewed from an ontological perspective, * Man has the objective capability to know the truth, * The person is intrinsically free, * There is a human nature, * There is an ethical dimension in men, and, * Men are essentially religious beings. In the second phase, Burgos has identified the key elements that define and distinguish Personalism as an original and new philosophy within this tradition. Those key elements are: * There is a radical distinction between things and persons. This is a Kantian standing point from which can be infer that people has to be analyzed with specific philosophical categories, and not with categories elaborated for things. * Affectivity has a radical importance. In Personalism, affectivity is an independent and original dimension of the person that includes a spiritual center, as intellect and freedom, usually identified with the heart. * Interpersonal and family relationships have a decisive importance in the configuration of personal identity. * Moral and religious values have absolute priority. Personalism separates from Aristotelian tradition because it considers that the main characteristic in a person is not intelligence, but will and the heart. This implies a priority of the act, which enables to give a philosophical relevance to love. * Corporeity. Contrary to a traditional forgetfulness of the body, Personalism recovers corporeity as an essential dimension, which, beyond the somatic aspect, also has a subjective and personal character. * Sexual dimorphism, man-woman. There are two ways of being a person: man and woman. The person is a dual reality and so forth, the sexual character affects the corporal, affective and spiritual dimensions. * The person is a social and communitarian subject. Personalism synthesizes the relationship person-society, by establishing the ontological priority of the person over any collectivity, but counterbalanced with the accountability of solidarity by the person. * Personalist philosophers understand philosophy as a means of interaction with cultural and social reality; that is to say, philosophy isn't consider as a mere academic exercise, but a way to transform society. * By their transcendent vision of life, personalists look for inspiration in their cultural tradition (Christian or Jewish) which allows them, always maintaining a rational perspective, not to dissociate artificially their existence as a person, from their existence as philosophers. * Personalism chooses a moderately positive valuation of Modern philosophy, although it understands that it has generated relevant errors, it also considers that has undeniably contributed to the anthropological wealth with elements like the subjectivity, the self, consciousness or the vindication of freedom. With these premises as foundation, Burgos has developed a personalist anthropology (Antropolog√≠a: una g√≠ia para la existencia, 2003) that incorporates the latter characteristics developing and integrating them organically on a fundamental anthropological concept: the one of person. According to Burgos, this is the main aspect by which Personalism distinguishes from other Classical anthropologies because those take their fundamental element in the concept of substance or of nature. Now, Burgos is working in developing and his studies have become deeper on main elements in personalism as: the personalist method and analogy, the relationship of personalism and metaphysics, praxis (Reconstruir la persona, 2009) or on human nature (Repensar la naturaleza humana, 2007).

The main class of R-genes consist of a nucleotide binding domain (NB) and a leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain(s) and are often referred to as (NB-LRR) R-genes. Generally, the NB domain binds either ATP/ADP or GTP/GDP. The LRR domain is often involved in protein-protein interactions as well as ligand binding. NB- LRR R-genes can be further subdivided into toll interleukin 1 receptor (TIR- NB-LRR) and coiled-coil (CC-NB-LRR). Resistance can be conveyed through a number of mechanisms including: * The R protein interacts directly with an Avr gene (Avirulence gene) product of a pathogen (see Gene-for-Gene relationship). * The R protein guards another protein that detects degradation by an Avr gene (see Guard Hypothesis). * The R protein may detect a Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern or PAMP (alternatively called MAMP for microbe-associated molecular pattern). * The R protein encodes enzyme that degrades a toxin produced by a pathogen. Once the R protein has detected the presence of a pathogen, the plant can mount a defence against the pathogen. Because R genes confer resistance against specific pathogens, it is possible to transfer an R gene from one plant to another and make a plant resistant to a particular pathogen. Many plant resistance proteins are single-pass transmembrane proteins that belong to receptor kinases and Toll-like receptors.  Background  Humans have been associated with plants since ancient times, and plants in general are an important part for the whole ecosystem on earth, the understanding of plant survival up until now is something that have been an important topic for scientists. Plants in general are in constant symbiotic relationships with fungus, and even bacteria, but there are cases these symbionts can take advantage of this symbiotic relationship in which case will result in a disadvantageous situation for both organisms. R genes protein syntheses are a way of identifying the pathogen effectors and stop their infection throughout the plant system. Molecules essential for pathogen defense are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), wall associated kinase (WAKs), receptors with nucleotide-binding domain (NLRs) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). All these R proteins play roles in detecting and recognizing pathogen effectors, initiating multiple signal transductions inside the plant cell, these signals transductions will lead to different responses that will aid in pathogen destruction and prevention of further infection. These responses are: *Production of Reactive Oxygen (ROS) *Hypersensitive Response *Closure of the stomata *Production of different chemical compounds (terpenes, phenolic, tannins, alkaloids, phytoalexins) Note that plants have various mechanisms to prevent and detect pathogenic infections, but factors such as geography, environment, genetic, and timing can affect the recognition pattern of a pathogen or can have an effect on the recognition of avirulent (avr) pathogens in plants. Pathogen recognition R genes synthesize proteins that will aid with the recognition of pathogenic effectors: =Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)= This receptor is often composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). LRRs have a wide range of bacterial (proteins), fungal (carbohydrates) and virulent (nucleic acids) recognition, this means that LRRs recognizes many different molecules but each LRRs usually has a very specific molecule it detects. The ability of PRRs to recognize various pathogenic components relies on a regulatory protein called brassinosteroid insensitive 1 ‚Äìassociated receptor kinase (BAK1). Once the pathogen has been recognized by PRRs the release of a kinase into the nucleus has been transduced triggering a transcriptional reprogramming. =Wall associated kinase (WAKs)= The plant cell wall is conformed of pectin and other molecules. Pectin has abundant galacturonic acids which is the compound that WAKs recognizes after a foreign invasion in the plant. Every WAKs (WAK1 & WAK2) has an N-terminal which interacts with pectin in the cell wall when pectin is being degraded to galacturonic acids by fungal enzymes. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) are often identified by lectins which is a protein that binds specific carbohydrates. =Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats (NLRs)= NLRs shifts its conformation from ADP state to and ATP state which allows it to send as signal transduction. The activation of NLRs is yet to be completely understood, according to current studies suggest that it is subject to multiple regulators (dimerization or oligomerization, epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, and proteasome-mediated regulation) Despite all these differences NLRs, PRRs, WAKs, effector trigger immunity (ETI) and PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) there are certain similarities such as in the mechanism of signal transduction which includes mitogen-protein kinase (MAPK) cascades through phosphorylation which will be, calcium ion signaling. An overall overview about the mechanical interaction about a plant defense and the ability of a pathogen to infect a plant would be for instance such a common interaction between bacterial flagellin and receptor-like kinase which triggers a basal immunity sending signals through MAP kinase cascades and transcriptional reprogramming mediated by plant WRKY transcription factors (Stephen T). Also plant resistance protein recognize bacterial effectors and programs resistance through ETI responses. Signal transduction A plant defense has two different types of immune system, the one that recognizes pathogen/microbes associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and this is also known as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Plant defense mechanism depends on immune receptors found on the plasma membrane and then the mechanism can sense the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Detection of PAMPs triggers a physiological change in the cell activated by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) initiating a cascade response which through the recognition of PAMPs and MAMPs lead to the plant resistance. The other type of defense is also known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI) which is the second type of defense mediated by R-proteins by detecting photogenic effectors. ETI detects pathogenic factors and initiates a defense response. ETI is a much faster and amplified system than PTI and it develops onto the hypersensitive response (HR) leading the infected host cell to apoptosis. This does not terminate the pathogen cycle, it just slows the cycle down. Plants have many ways of identifying symbiotic or foreign pathogens; one of these receptors causes fluctuations in the calcium ions and this fluctuation in the calcium ions. A transcription factor plays an important role in defenses against pathogenic invasion. Pathogen invasion Despite the sophiscation of plant defenses, some pathogens have evolved ways to overcome these defenses in order to infect and spread. Pathogen elicitors are molecules that stimulate any plant defense; among these elicitors we can find two types of pathogen derived elicitors, pathogen/microbe associated molecular pattern (PAMPs/MAMPs), and also there is a second type which is produced by plants known as damage or danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PTI is a way of responding against pathogen actions happening outside the cell, but a much stronger response like ETI is generated in response to effectors molecules. Once there is an induced resistance also known as priming, the plant can react faster and stronger to a pathogen attack. A known priming inducer is called Œ≤-aminobutyric acid (BABA) which is a non-protein amino acid. Transgenic plants that produce BABA prime themselves and can effectively defend against Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Plectoesphaerella cucumerina (Baccelli, Ivan). Experiments that put this technique on crops are underway. Successful pathogens evolve changes in their chemical conformation in order to avoid detection by PRRs and WAKs. Some viruses have mechanisms that allow them to avoid or suppress the RNA-mediated defense (RMD) that some viruses induce in non-transgenic plants. Further studies have shown that this suppression of the host defense has being done by HC-protease (HCPro) encoded in the Potyviral genome. It was later stablished that HCPro was a mechanism used to suppress post-transcriptional gene slicing (PTGs). Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) uses a different protein called 2b () which is also a suppressor of PTGS in Nicotiana benthamiana. Even though HcPro and the 2b protein have different protein sequence specific to their own virus, both target the same instrument of defense through different mechanisms.

He was an academic, politician, member of several distinguished academic bodies, and one of the last surviving rulers of the former princely states of the British Raj. He was also the last surviving knight of the Order of the Indian Empire and the last of either of the chivalric orders of the British Indian Empire. Early life Maharaja Meghrajji III was born on 3 March 1923 at Sundar Villas, Dhrangadhra as the second but eldest surviving son of Maharaja Sir Ghanshyamsinjhi Ajitsinhji Sahib Bahadur (1889‚Äì1942), the Maharaja of the 13-gun salute state of Dhrangadhra-Halvad and his third wife, Maharani Anand Kunverba Sahiba (1895‚Äì1979). He received his earliest education at a local school, then was sent to England, where he first attended Millfield School in Somerset and then the Heath Mount School in Hertfordshire. He then studied at Haileybury College before returning to India just prior to succeeding his father as Maharaja. Maharaja of Dhrangadhra-Halvad Upon the death of his father in 1942, Mehghrajji succeeded him as Maharaja. He continued his education at St. Joseph's Academy in Dehra Dun and at the Shivaji Military School in Poona (now Pune). During his reign, he served as the Patron of Talukdari Girassia College and of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. From 1945 to 1947, he was a member of the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Princes. Meghrajji's reign proved to be a short one, as when independence came to India in 1947, Meghrajji signed an Instrument of Accession to India. In that same year, he was knighted by being appointed a member of the Order of the Indian Empire, one of the last. However, Meghrajji threw himself wholeheartedly into the cause for his new nation, serving as a member of the Constituent Assembly of India from 1947 to 1948. On 15 February 1948, the Maharaja merged Dhrangadhra- Halvad into the United State of Kathiawad and into the Union of Saurashtra just a month later. Politician and academic From 1948 to 1952, Meghrajji served as Uprajpramukh (Deputy Rajpramukh) of the state of Saurashtra, also serving briefly (in 1949) as president of its state bank. In 1953, he attended the coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1967, he became a Member of the 4th Lok Sabha, representing Surendranagar, as Member of Parliament from 1967 to 1971. Working to keep the tradition of royal India's monarchies alive, Meghrajji simultaneously held the chair of Intendant-General for the Consultation of Rulers of Indian States in Concord for India until 1971. In the 1950s, Meghrajji studied at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a B.Litt in 1958. He also studied at the Ruskin School of Drawing and at the Institute for Social Anthropology at Oxford. Personal life In 1943, Meghrajji married Maharani Shrimati Sri Rajni Brijraj Kunverba Sahiba of Jodhpur. The couple had three sons: *Sodhsalji Shatrujitdev Sahib, Yuvaraja of Dhrangadhra-Halvad, who succeeded him to the Maharaja Raj Sahib of Dhrangadhra-Halvad throne *Dr. Jayasinhji Jawahirdev Sahib *Siddhrajsinhji Gautama Deo Sahib Later life Since 1966, he had served as the President of Rajkumar College, Rajkot and of the Sri Rajaram Educational Foundation. He was also a life member of the Millfield Society, the Indian Council of World Affairs, the Indian Parliamentary Group, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (all since 1967), the Linguistic Society of India, the Numismatic Society of India, the Heraldry Society of India and the World Wildlife Fund. As well, he was a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society and of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. He was also a member of the Cricket Club of India and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. Death The Maharaja died of complications of old age at Dhrangadhra on 1 August 2010, aged 87. He was succeeded by his eldest son Sodhsalji Shatrujitdev, the heir and titular Maharaja to the throne of Dhrangadhra-Halvad.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2008, 21 different albums topped the chart; placings were based on electronic point of sale data from retail outlets. In the issue of Billboard dated January 5, the Eagles were at number one with Long Road Out of Eden, the album's sixth week in the top spot. Two weeks later, it was displaced by the self-titled album by Taylor Swift, which returned to number one having spent eight weeks atop the chart in 2007. The album spent a further 16 weeks at number one in 2008, in five separate spells atop the chart. Its final week at number one came in the issue of Billboard dated July 26, and the following week Swift replaced herself in the top spot when Beautiful Eyes entered the chart at number one. The new release, a limited-run EP available only at Walmart stores or online, held the top spot for a single week. Swift returned to number one in November with her second full-length album Fearless, which spent the final five weeks of the year atop the chart and made her the only act with three number ones during the year. Two acts reached number one with two different albums in 2008. Tim McGraw unusually topped the chart with two different greatest hits albums: in May he spent a single week at number one with Greatest Hits: Limited Edition, a combined re-release of his first two such albums, which had each reached number one in their own right in 2000 and 2006. In October he returned to the top of the chart with the newly released Greatest Hits 3. Toby Keith spent time at number one with both 35 Biggest Hits and That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy. Several acts reached number one in 2008 for the first time, beginning with the group Lady Antebellum with its self-titled album in May. On June 7, Julianne Hough, best known as one of the professional dancers from the TV show Dancing with the Stars, spent a week at number one with her debut album. Two weeks later singer Jewel reached the top spot with her first release to enter the country chart; her albums had appeared on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart for more than a decade, but Perfectly Clear was her first recording in the country genre. The duo Sugarland spent six non-consecutive weeks at number one in August and September with its first chart-topper Love on the Inside, and in September and October Jessica Simpson and Darius Rucker both topped the chart for the first time. Rucker was the first African-American artist to become a major star in the country genre since Charley Pride in the late 1960s. Chart history Julianne Hough topped the chart six months after she was half of the winning couple on TV's Dancing with the Stars for the second time. Sugarland spent six weeks at number one with Love on the Inside. Learn to Live was the first number one for Darius Rucker. Tim McGraw topped the chart with two different greatest hits albums in 2008. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=colIssue date !scope=colTitle !scope=colArtist(s) !scope=col class=unsortableRef. - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"Long Road Out of Eden  rowspan=\\"2\\"Eagles align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"7\\"Taylor Swift  rowspan=\\"7\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"My Life's Been a Country Song  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Taylor Swift  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"Good Time  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"Taylor Swift  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"Troubadour  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Lady Antebellum  rowspan=\\"1\\"Lady Antebellum align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Troubadour  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Greatest Hits: Limited Edition  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"'  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Julianne Hough  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Taylor Swift  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Perfectly Clear Jewel align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"5\\"Taylor Swift  rowspan=\\"6\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Beautiful Eyes align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"5\\"Love on the Inside  rowspan=\\"5\\"Sugarland align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Now That's What I Call Country  rowspan=\\"1\\"Various Artists align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Love on the Inside  rowspan=\\"1\\"Sugarland align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Do You Know  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"Learn to Live  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Kellie Pickler  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Greatest Hits 3  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"2\\"Lucky Old Sun  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"1\\"Play  rowspan=\\"1\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=\\"5\\"Fearless  rowspan=\\"5\\" align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center } References 2008 United States Country Albums Category:2008 in American music ","title":"List of Top Country Albums number ones of 2008"},{"id":"21760076","text":"The Globe Investment Trust plc was a very large British investment trust.

The modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was formed in 1932 by the House of Saud, who are followers of a movement within Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism or \\"the Wahhabite mission\\". Followers of the Wahhabite mission‚Äîwho dominate religious institutions, courts and education of the kingdom‚Äîbelieve that \\"Muslims should return to the interpretation of Islam found in the classical texts, the Quran and the Sunnah.\\" They also believe that \\"Muslims who seek intercession from holy men, such as the imams revered by Shiites, are not 'true' Muslims.\\" While attempts to force conversion of Shiites have been infrequent, they face severe discrimination in Saudi Arabia and even executions (both legal and extrajudicial). Saudi Arabia's Twelver Shia community, the Baharna, is primarily concentrated in the country's Eastern province, chiefly Qatif and Al-Ahsa. A Twelver Shia community also exists in Medina known as the Nakhawila. Similarly, a tribal Shia community also exists in the Hijaz region, manifesting itself in three tribes: the Banu Husayn (Al Hussaini), the Sharifs of Mecca who ruled for more than five centuries, along with two traditionally nomadic Hijazi tribes of Harb (especially the Banu Ali branch)Die Welt des Islams: Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Islamkunde, Volume 37 page 289 and Juhaynah. A few historians believe that these Bedouin tribes belonged to a strain of Shia Islam that is neither Twelver nor Zaydi, with some believing that they profess neo-Kaysanite beliefs. Shia Islam exists in the southern region of the kingdom, with Najran and its Yam tribe being traditionally Sulaymani Ismaili. Zaydism also exists in a few towns bordering northern Yemen. History While Saudi Arabia has only existed since 1932, an earlier Al Saud state (Emirate of Diriyah) clashed with Shiites. Ibn Abdul-Wahhab believed that Shiites \\"imported into Islam\\" the practice of building mosques on graves, a practice he considered un-Islamic. He referred to the Shiites as Rafida (rejecters), a sectarian name his followers have continued to use. In 1802, the Saud-Wahhabi alliance waged jihad (or at least qital, i.e. war) on the Shiite holy city of Karbala. There, according to a Wahhabi chronicler \`Uthman b. \`Abdullah b. Bishr: Al-Hasa, the main Shiite area of what is now Saudi Arabia, was conquered by Saudi forces in 1913. The initial treatment of Shiites was harsh, with religious leaders compelled to vow to \\"cease observance of their religious holidays, to shut down their special places of worship and to stop pilgrimages to holy sites in Iraq.\\" Wahhabi ulema also \\"ordered the demolition of several Shiite mosques\\" and took \\"over teaching and preaching duties at the remaining mosques in order to convert the population.\\" Saudi authorities have acted on Wahhabi desires to eliminate \\"vestiges of Shia religiosity\\" in and around Medina. In 1926, the Al-Baqi' mausoleum‚Äîwhich included the tombs of the Prophet Muhammad's family and his companions, second, forth, fifth, and six Shiite Imams‚Äîwas destroyed by Ibn Saud. In 1975, the tomb of a Shiite imam (Ismail ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq) was reportedly destroyed,Commins, David, The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia, p.170Ende, Werner, \\"The Nakhawila, a Shiite community in Medina past and present.\\" Die Welt des Islams, xxxvii/3 (1997), p.294, n.109David Commins may be mistaken as there appears to be no Imam named Ismail ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq. Ja'far al-Sadiq was the 6th Imam and Ismail ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq may have been the son of Ja'far al-Sadiq. and a year later an ancient palm tree that legend had it had been planted under the direction of the Prophet Muhammad, and visited by Shiite and Sunni pilgrims for generations, was cut down on orders of a high ranking Wahhabi shiekh.Ende, Werner, \\"The Nakhawila, a Shia community in Medina past and present.\\" Die Welt des Islams, xxxvii/3 (1997), p.297, n.128 In 1979, the Iranian Islamic Revolution overthrew the Shah of Iran, replacing a pro-Western monarchy with an anti-Western theocratic Islamic republic. Iran is more populous than Saudi Arabia and its borders are relatively close to the latter's oil fields‚Äîwhich is also where most Shiites who are ethnic Baharna have traditionally lived. The Iranian scholars were eager to export their \\"revolution,\\" and ideologically opposed to both monarchical systems of government and any state allied with the West. Leaflets, radio broadcasts and tape cassettes from Iran targeted the Baharna and the other shitte and attacked the Saudi government for corruption and hypocrisy. That November, Shiites commemorated Ashura (illegally) for the first time in many years. In February demonstrations were held on the one year anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's return to Iran. Saudi officials responded with both \\"sticks and carrots\\", arresting activists but also promising more schools, hospitals and infrastructure for the Shia region. In 1987, following the deaths of over 300 during a demonstration by Iranian pilgrims in Mecca during the Hajj pilgrimage, Khomeini \\"denounced the House of Saud as \\"murderers\\" and called on all loyal Shiites in the Kingdom to rise up and overthrow them\\", further alarming Saudi officials. After oil pipelines were bombed in 1988, the Saudi government accused Shiites of sabotage executed several. In collective punishment restrictions were placed on their freedoms and they were further marginalized economically. Wahhabi ulama were given the green light to sanction violence against Shia. Fatwas were passed by the country's leading cleric, Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz denouncing Shia as apostates from Islam.In the 1990s, leading Wahhabi clerics like Ibn Baz and Abd Allah ibn Jibrin reiterated the customary view that Shia were infidels. (source: Ende, Werner, \\"The Nakhawila, a Shia community in Medina past and present.\\" Die Welt des Islams, xxxvii/3 (1997), p.335) After the 1991 Gulf war ended, weakening Iran's mortal foe Saddam Hussien and exhibiting the strength of Saudi ally the United States, \\"there was a noticeable thaw in relations between the two countries.\\" In 1993, the Saudi government announced a general amnesty resulting in various Shiite leaders being released from jail or returning from exile. \\"Hundreds of young [Shiites]\\" were provided with jobs in the governmental and private sectors. The anti-Shiite Imam of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina was even sacked after he attacked Shiism in a Friday sermon in the presence of Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. In 2003, the political direction turned again, and a series of \\"National Dialogues\\" were initiated that included Shiites (as well as Sufis, liberal reformers, and professional women), to the strong disapproval of Wahhabi purists. In late 2003, \\"450 Shia academics, businessmen, writers, and women\\" presented a petition to Crown Prince Abdullah demanding a greater rights including the right for Shia to be referred to \\"their own religious courts as Sunni courts do not recognize testimonies by Shia.\\" As of 2006, more militant Saudi Wahhabi clerics were circulating a petition calling for an intensification of sectarian violence against Shiites, while the official religious establishment was calling for them to renounce their \\"fallacious\\" beliefs voluntarily and embrace \\"the right path\\" of Islam, rather than be killed, expelled, or converted by violence. Community structure, political and religious authority In modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Sunni rulers limit Shiite political participation to \\"notables\\", according to scholar Vali Nasr. These notables benefit from their ties to power, and in return are expected to control their community.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival (W.W. Norton & Company, New York, 2006) p. 84 Much political activity takes place outside these parameters. Since 1979, hundreds of Saudi Shiites have been jailed, executed, and exiled. =Opposition= According to Ondrej Beranek of Brandeis University, Shiite opposition in Saudi Arabia has \\"undergone various stages of development.\\" Saudi Shiites found Ayatollah Khomeini and the Iranian Revolution a \\"political inspiration\\", but an \\"important ideological source\\" was the organization Harakat al-risaliyin al- tala'i' (literally \\"the Movement of Vanguards' Missionaries\\"), established in 1968 not in Iran but in the Iraqi city of Karbala under the auspices of marja' al- taqlid (religious authority) Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi al- Shirazi. Other organizations include Munazzamat al-thawra 'l-islamiyya (Organization of Islamic Revolution) -- established after the Intifada of 1979. Focusing on peaceful change it changed its name to al-Haraka 'l-islahiyya (Reform Movement). In response to this change, King Fahd, met several of al-Saffar's followers and in October 1993 a pact was signed. Fahd promised to work towards improving conditions for Shia in Saudi Arabia, ordering the elimination of derogatory terms for them from textbooks, removing certain other forms of explicit discrimination, allowing many Shiite exiles to return to Saudi Arabia, and other acts. In return, al-Haraka 'l-islahiyya was dissolved and its members formally agreed to dissociate themselves from foreign groups and movements. As of 2009, the main spokesman and representative of the Saudi Shiite movement in its more moderate incarnation has been Sheikh Hassan al- Saffar (b. 1958). Al-Saffar represents one of the few voices publicly calling for moderate, pragmatic action, tolerance and reconciliation between Shiites and Sunnis, and a political system based on civil society, free elections and freedom of speech. At the other end of the Shiite political spectrum is the Saudi Hizballah or Hezbollah Al-Hejaz. Established in 1987, it supports the overthrow of the absolute monarchy. In 1988 and 1989, Saudi Hizballah led a couple of attacks on oil infrastructure and also murdered Saudi diplomats in Ankara, Bangkok, and Karachi. They were also allegedly involved in 1996 Khobar Towers bombing which killed dozens of US army personnel. Some of its members went through training in Iran. The group also is thought to use Iranian training camps in the Biqa' valley in Lebanon. The group throughout the 1980s and 1990s became notorious for killing Saudi police and army personnel, Wahhabi preachers, people from the interior ministry and intelligence as well as conducting specialized attacks on ARAMCO facilities and the Saudi naval forces. During the late 1990s however, the insurgency abruptly stopped as the Saudi government tired by the carnage and constant defeat of its forces to terminate the insurgency committed itself to genuine reforms. These reforms were brokered with Iraqi Shia scholars of the al-Badr organization.\\"Hezbollah of Greater Bahrain\\" - Ahmed al-Khaz'Ali In addition to these two factions, there are also smaller groups of traditionalists who look at the Saudi regime with suspicion and do not intend to become part of any reconciliation talks. The American embassy in Saudi Arabia (as revealed by wikileaks), refers to these two political groupings of Shiites in the Eastern Province as Islahiyyah (the Shirazis) and Hezbollah Al-Hejaz (Saudi Hezbollah). Following the 9/11 attacks and 2003 Riyadh compound bombings, Saudi Arabia seemed determined to stop the brutal campaign against its Shiite community, which in previous decades had resulted in hundreds of Shiites being jailed, executed, and exiled. Such a liberal move, however, could easily be understood as merely part of a new campaign aimed at improving the image of Saudi Arabia in the West. Restrictions and persecutions The Saudi government has often been viewed as an active oppressor of Shiiteshttps://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/24/anti-shia-bias-driving-saudi- arabia-unrest because of the funding of the Wahhabi ideology which denounces the Shiite faith. In 1988 fatwas passed by the country's leading cleric, Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz denounced the Shiites as apostates.With Neighbors Like These Iraq and the Arab States on Its Borders, edited by David Pollock, Washington Institute Policy Focus No 70, June 2007, p33.

Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin, a member of the Higher Council of Ulama sanctioned the killing on Shiites in 1994. According to Vali Nasr, this was still be reiterated in Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002. By 2007 al-Jibrin wrote that [Shiites] \\"are the most vicious enemy of Muslims, who should be wary of their plots.\\" According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch report, Shiite citizens in Saudi Arabia \\"face systematic discrimination in religion, education, justice, and employment\\".Saudi Arabia: Treat Shia Equallyhrw.org 2009/09/02 Saudi Arabia has no Shiite cabinet ministers, mayors or police chiefs, according to another source, Vali Nasr, unlike other countries with sizable Shiite populations (such as Iraq and Lebanon). Shiites are kept out of \\"critical jobs\\" in the armed forces and the security services, and not one of the three hundred Shiite girls schools in the Eastern Province has a Shiite principal. Pakistani columnist Mohammad Taqi has written that \\"the Saudi regime is also acutely aware that, in the final analysis, Shiite grievances [...] stem from socioeconomic deprivation, as a result of religious repression and political marginalization bordering on apartheid.\\" Testifying before the US Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Ali al-Ahmed, Director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, stated > Saudi Arabia is a glaring example of religious apartheid.

In November 2014 at al-Dalwah village in the eastern province of al-Ahsa, three unknown masked gunmen opened fire at a Husseiniya, or Shi'ite religious center, killing eight and injuring a dozens. While Saudi citizen circles blamed the Khawarij for the attack, claiming they wanted to start a civil war, a handful of articles in the Saudi press argued that the attack \\"had not come out of nowhere\\", that there was anti-Shi'ite incitement in the kingdom on the part of \\"the religious establishment, preachers, and even university lecturers ‚Äì and that it was on the rise\\". The Saudi government/religious establishment, as well as the National media did not comment on the attack. In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr, who had called for pro-democracy demonstrations, along with forty-seven other sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court on terrorism charges. = 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests = See Also: Anti-Shi'ism#Saudi Arabia, Qatif conflict, 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests In the context of the Arab Springs, the only province with a majority Shia population, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, arose against the Saudi regime in 2011 and 2012. The Shia protesters were repressed in blood, and their situation did not improve. These protests were a turning point in the relations between the Saudi Shia minority and the Saudi regime because they led to the radicalisation of both sides. The protests took place in a region where competing states use sectarianism to expand their influence. Sectarianism is when the support of some people or organisations for a religious or political group is so strong that it can cause troubles to other groups. In fact, a proxy war has emerged between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the Gulf region. They both aim at having the regional hegemony based on a narrative of their legacy of two civilisations, repectively the Persians and the Arabs. However, the violent sectarian confrontation between Shias and Sunnis in Saudi Arabia is recent. For long, the predominant politics were of reasonable accommodation between the sects and religions. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist conception of Shia Islam rose up in Iran as opposed to the quietist conception of Shia Islam. That means that religion had a strong role in the Iranian policies. In reaction, the Sunnis tended to stiffen their own interpretation of Islam. In Saudi Arabia it was translated by an acute Salafism. The sectarian discourses have been used by Saudi Arabia and Iran to acquire the regional hegemony but the practice of sectarianism is more tempered. On the Iranian side, defending Shia minorities in practice means abandoning their universalist revolutionary message. On the Saudi side, using the radical Sunni rhetoric means strengthening the Sunni radicals. Since the Saudi regime is allied with Western countries such as the United-States, it would then be the target of these radical groups. Even though, the Saudi regime uses the distinction between Sunnis and Shias in an attempt to highlight the religious and cultural difference of Iran compared to the other Gulf countries. In fact, the confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia is mostly the product of political factors and of regional ambitions. Sectarianism is a part of this showdown, not than a cause of it. In this context of sectarianism linked to regional competition, protests took place in Qatif region, East of Saudi Arabia, a region predominantly inhabited by Shias. The region is rich in oil and most of the workers of the national Saudi oil company, ARAMCO, were used to organising protests for the workers' rights. Protests erupted following several triggers including the self-immolation of a man in the city of Samtah, South West of Saudi Arabia. The Shias of the East of Saudi Arabia organised demonstrations after knowing some Shia protests in Bahrein and in reaction to Saudi Shias being imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for their alleged, but debated, culpability for the Khobar Towers bombing of 1996. The protests then spread due to the youth mobilisation, especially on social media but never really made it outside the predominantly Shia Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. At first, the protesters' demands were similar to those of the Arab Springs taking place in other countries of the Middle-East, so to say individual freedoms rather than religious rights. In fact, the religious practices of the Shias in the Eastern province were accepted by the central authority. For example, since the conquest of Al-Ahsa in 1913, which marked the integration of this majority Shia region to the Saudi Sultanate, the Shias established some courts which were accepted by the Saudi State and which provided justice according to Shia principles. Those liberties offered to Shias did not exist in regions of Saudi Arabia where the Shias were a minority. But, at the same time, the official religious discourse in Saudi Arabia was condemning the Shia practices. Other demands of the protesters consisted in asking for more autonomy for the region. For this reason, and because of a fear of a \\"Shia encirclement,\\" the Saudi regime responded. It began by countering the protests in the region of Qatif. For long the regime co-opted a local class of notables in order to drive the public opinion. They did so, partly by appointing Shias as judges in the Shia courts of the region. However, in Qatif the notables were superseded after the Iranian Revolution by some political activists who were more radical in their demands and who were left-behinds of the redistribution policies driven by the notables. In fact, the majority of Shia notables followed Shia figures of authority, the Maraji', who advocated for a spiritual role for the clergy rather than a political one. By withdrawing from the field of clerical education, the notables let Shia Islamist movements taking that role. That is why, in 2011, the protests were led by young people, influenced by the previous radical movements, active on social media and independent from the notables. To slow down the protests, the regime aspired to rely on the notables who were looking to preserve some of their influence on the population against new local leaders. The notables appointment to positions of authority by the Saudi regime depended on their belonging to Shi'ism. Consequently, their interest was that the regime still saw Shias as a social group with a strong identity. The regime exploited this position to control the notables. From the notable point of view, either they supported the regime, with a risk of being removed from their positions by the protesters, or they supported the protesters, with a risk of being removed from their position by the Saudi regime. A declaration was signed by notables on the 21st of April 2011 calling for a break in the protests. The main signatory was Hassan Al-Saffar, a Shia scholar from Qatif who was considered as one the most important Shia leaders of Saudi Arabia, and who founded the Islamic Reform Movement in 1991. This movement descended from the Organization for the Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula which aimed at a Shia revolution in Saudi Arabia. Despite Al-Saffar's call, the protests only halted when a Facebook page which had previously called for demonstrations, asked the protesters to let some time to the government to implement the changes it promised. The main goal of the regime was to prevent the protests of the Eastern province to spill-over the rest of the country. To this end, the Saudi regime used a sectarian narrative opposing the Shia minority to the Sunni majority of the country. The Wahhabis brought to light some fatwas denouncing Shias as apostate. The media also repeated over and over an identity narrative differentiating the communities. In fact, the Saudi regime controlled much media broadcasting in and about Saudi Arabia through either co-option of coercion. Co-option strategies has been revealed by Wikileaks: the Saudi regime paid 2 million US$ to the Lebanese MTV Network in 2012 in order to counter media hostile to the Saudi Kingdom and in order for the channel to invite pro-regime Saudis as guests on talk shows. Wikileaks also revealed a co-option through advertisement. ONTV, an Egyptian channel invited the head of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia. Knowing that, the Saudi embassy asked the owner of the TV station to change its policies, arguing that, otherwise Saudi Arabia would stop its advertisements on the channel. Coercion was often used when media could not be co-opted, it could be done because the Saudi regime controlled the access to the two satellites through which the channels needed to pass to broadcast in Saudi Arabia. For example, Iranian TV channels were denied broadcasting on those satellites for one month in 2009 following accusation of support toward the Houthi rebels in Yemen. In general, the Saudi national media broadcast programs aimed at diverting the Saudi from politics and the Saudi international programs aimed at promoting an image of Saudi Arabia as a modern country. During the 2011 protests, they rather aimed at setting a sectarian agenda to counter what the Saudi regime interpreted as the Iranian influence in the Gulf. To do so, some Wahhabi clerics were relayed by some Salafi channels such as Almajd TV Network. They portrayed the Shias as infidels and as a threat. To this extent those channels reproduced Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's message and provoked Jihad. The last strategy of the Saudi regime to repress Qatif unrests was the action of the Saudi police on the ground. The police was loyal to the regime partly because there were almost no Shias within its ranks. The Eastern province police, while formerly being under the control of the General Manager of the province, was, in practice, under the control of the central Saudi regime. The Saudi police's mission was mainly to protect a social order, the containment of the crime being only secondary. There also was a parallel religious police, called Mutawa, which was active in the region, and a secret service, the Mabahith, charged with counter-terrorism. The actions of the police were facilitated by the Saudi laws, and especially the absence of Constitutional ones, which protect people's freedoms in other countries. Even though the Shias generally asked for more inclusion in Saudi Arabia, rather than to overthrow the monarchy, the State still treated this community as a security menace needed to be contained because of the regime's bias and stereotypes toward the Shias. While some social media activists were asking for what they called a 'Day of rage' (in reference to the first day of protests in Bahrein) on 11 March 2011, the police killed Faisal Ahmed Abdul-Ahad, one of the organisers of this event two weeks before the planned demonstrations and violently arrested several protesters on the 4th of March. On the one hand, this repression intimidated the people who thought to go on strikes on the 11th. On the other hand the protesters who carried on with the movement radicalised their practices. Consequently, the protests of the 11th of March in Qatif were minor: only a few hundred of people protested on that day whereas there were more than 26.000 members of the Facebook group organising it. Despite this failure of the protests, they became more and more violent in the following weeks which created a vicious circle. The police were heavily politicised and resembled a military force while the rioters began to use incendiary projectiles and guns against the police. All of this led to a rhetoric of the regime criminalising the protesters in the eyes of the Saudi population. At least 17 protesters and one policeman were killed but the protests ended up slowing down due to the State repression. =2017‚Äì19 Qatif unrest= Since May 2017https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDeDA9JRRrAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfwFS_Ynn7ghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3U8jHg- HNAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0W5z-6zKt8 in response to protests against the government, the predominantly Shia town of Al-Awamiyah was put under full siege by the Saudi military.

On July 26, 2017, Saudi authorities began refusing to give emergency services to wounded civilians. Saudi Arabia has also not provided humanitarian help to trapped citizens of Awamiyah. In August 2017, it was reported that the Saudi government demolished 488 buildings in Awamiyah. This demolition came from a siege of the city by the Saudi government, as it continued to try to prevent the citizens of the city from gaining rights. 20,000 residents were forced to flee from their homes to survive.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi- security-awamiya-idUSKBN1AJ217http://presstv.ir/Detail/2017/08/11/531369/UN- Saudi-Arabia-Awamiyah President of Quran Council and two cousins of executed Nimr al-Nimr were also killed by Saudi security forces in Qatif in 2017. =Suppression of religious practice= The Saudi government has refused to allow Shiite teachers and students exemption from school to partake in activities for the Day of Ashura, one of the most important religious days for Shiites which commemorates the martyrdom of Muhammad's grandson, Husayn bin Ali, at the hands of the second Sunni Umayyad Caliph, Yazid.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica In 2009, during Ashura commencements, Shia religious and community leaders were arrested protesting against the government and chanting slogans against Wahhabis. In 2009 a group of Shiites on their way to perform hajj pilgrimage (one of the five pillars of Islam that all able-bodied Muslims are required to perform once in their lives) in Mecca were arrested by Saudi religious police due to the involvement in a protest against the Saudi government. A fifteen-year-old pilgrim was shot in the chest and an unknown assailant stabbed a Shiite sheikh in the back, shouting \\"Kill the rejectionist [Shia]\\". In Medina Shiite pilgrims go to Jannat al Baqi mainly to visit the grave of Fatimah and Ahl al-Bayt who are buried in the cemetery of Jannat al-Baqi' but no visit of other Sahabah in Islam. Many incidences of not following the rules of the place happened by Shiite in this region specifically resulting in the arrest which most of the times were released later. Shiites and Sunni Hanafi, Shafi'is, Barelvis, and Dawoodi Bohra Ismailis usually pray near graves of Ahl al-Bayt but in Wahhabism this act is considered as shirk. In Saudi Arabia, most of the people follow an interpretation of Sunni Islam called Wahhabism, which does not allow practices like praying near graves of Ahl al-Bayt in Jannat al Baqi. Early 2009, several people grabbed stones, sand from the grave of Fatimah (who is daughter of Muhammad and the wife of Ali) in order to make turbahs out of them which is not permissible according certain interpretations of Sunni Islam, like Wahhabism. Late 2011, an Australian man was charged for not following the law and involved with blasphemy and sentenced to 500 lashes and 2 years in jail; the latter sentence was later reduced.Australian faces lashes for blasphemy in Saudi Arabia 7 December 2011 bbc news Also late 2011, a prominent Shiite Canadian cleric, Usama al-Attar, was arrested for unknown reasons but possibly because of his criticism of the kingdom's response to uprisings in Yemen and Bahrain.Saudi police arrest Canadian imam at Hajj aljazeera.com 31 Oct 2011 He was released on the same day, declaring the arrest entirely unprovoked.Saudi police release Canadian Shia imam aljazeera.com Last Modified: 31 Oct 2011 =Discrimination in education= Much of education in Saudi Arabia is based on Wahhabi religious material. The government has restricted the names that Shiites can use for their children in an attempt to discourage them from showing their identity. Saudi textbooks are hostile to Shiism, often characterizing the faith as a form of heresy worse than Christianity and Judaism. =Discrimination in the workforce= Much discrimination occurs in the Saudi workforce as well. Shiites are prohibited from becoming teachers of religious subjects, which constitute about half of the courses in secondary education.Discrimination against Shiite Muslims in Saudi Arabia: The Old and New Reality by Dr. Mohamed J. Al-Hassan (King Saud University) Shia cannot become principals of schools. Some Shia have become university professors but often face harassment from students and faculty alike. Shiites are disqualified as witnesses in court, as Saudi Sunni sources cite the Shi'a practise of Taqiyya wherein it is permissible to lie while one is in fear or at risk of significant persecution. Shiites cannot serve as judges in ordinary court, and are banned from gaining admission to military academies, and from high-ranking government or security posts, including becoming pilots in Saudi Airlines.Meyer, Henry. \\"Saudi Arabia Risks Shia Unrest in Wake of Bahrain Turmoil  Businessweek  20 Feb. 2011. Amir Taheri quotes a Shi'ite businessman from Dhahran as saying \\"It is not normal that there are no Shi'ite army officers, ministers, governors, mayors and ambassadors in this kingdom.

Apartheid, Saudi Style, New York Post, May 22, 2003. =Reactions= Human Rights Watch reports that Shiites want to be treated as equals and desire to be free from discrimination (Human Rights Watch).

Saudi official Sheik Ali Khursan declared Ismaelis to be infidels because according to him \\"they did not follow the Sunna and do not believe that the Qur'an is complete\\", stating \\"We don't eat their food, we don't intermarry with them, we should not pray for their dead or allow them to be buried in our cemeteries.\\" In 1997 the Governor Prince Mish'al ordered police to prevent Ismaelis from performing prayers during the post-Ramadan Islamic festival of Eid al-Fitr. \\"Anti-Ismaeli campaigns resulted in many arrests and flogging.\\" In April 2000, responding to an Amnesty International campaign publicizing lack of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia, Ismaelis in Najran openly commemorated Ashura for the first time in many years. Shortly thereafter Saudi religious police \\"stormed a major Ismaeli mosque, seized many of its religious texts and arrested three clerics\\". Local Ismaelis, who are often armed, retaliated, firing on security forces and burning some of their vehicles and killing dozens of them. Approximately 40 policemen and members of various security forces (all non-Ismaili) were killed and many more injured. Saudi Army reinforcements swept the area and made many arrests.

She was possibly the mother of Clodius. Personal life Caecilia Metella was the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus, consul in 123 BC. She was possibly married to Appius Claudius Pulcher, a politician of an old, somewhat impoverished, patrician family. As a member of an important family and married into another, Metella would be one of Rome's most esteemed matronas. Pulcher had three sons, Appius, Gaius and the famous Publius, and three (possibly four) girls, all named Claudia, one who married Lucullus, one who married Quintus Marcius Rex, and one (known as Clodia) who married Metellus Celer. Protector During Sulla's proscriptions, Metella sheltered Sextus Roscius after his father's murder. Later, Roscius was defended by the young Cicero, helped by Metella's nephews Metellus Celer and Metellus Nepos, in the celebrated speech Pro Roscio Amerino. Temple of Juno This woman has been identified with the one who in 90 BC had a dream of Juno Sospita complaining about the neglect of her temple. Metella cleaned out the temple and was credited with saving the cult of Sopita.  Cultural depictions  Author Colleen McCullough included Metella as a character in her novel Fortune's Favourites, a fictionalised account of the demise of Sulla and rise of Julius Caesar.

Both are short rural highways in the Arkansas Delta. Created in 1957, the longer segment connects several small communities to Interstate 40 (I-40). The shorter route was created in 1973 between a Horton and Highway 1 in Caldwell. Both segments are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT). Route description Both highways are located in the Western Lowlands Pleistocene Valley Trains ecoregion within the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, broad, nearly level, agriculturally-dominated alluvial plain with flat, clayey, poorly-drained soils commonly called the Arkansas Delta in the state. The two routes are separated by approximately along St. Francis County Road 255, a paved road. No segment of Highway 261 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =South Plains to Palestine= Palestine City Hall is located along Highway 261 near the northern terminus Highway 261 begins at Highway 259 at South Plains, an unincorporated community in northwest Lee County. The highway runs east across flat fields used for row crops to an intersection with Highway 121 at Holub. The highway turns north, continuing through sparsely populated agricultural areas, including the unincorporated community Gill, before crossing into St. Francis County. Highway 261 continues north as a section line road through Humphrey to Palestine, a small city in the Arkansas Delta. The highway intersects US Highway 70 (US 70) near Palestine‚ÄìWheatley High School before becoming Parker Avenue and entering a commercial district. The highway parallels the Union Pacific Railway tracks before turning north, becoming Main Street. Along Main Street, the highway passes Palestine City Hall prior to a junction with I-40 (and unsigned US 63). Highway 261 ends just north of the last freeway ramp at the northern city limits, with the roadway continuing north as St. Francis County Road 255. The ARDOT maintains Highway 261 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the Department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ARDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. As of 2017, AADT was estimated as 240 vehicles per day (VPD) near the southern terminus, 670 VPD north of the Highway 121 intersection, 920 north of the St. Francis County line, and 2,500 in Palestine between I-40 and US 70. For reference, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), classifies roads with fewer than 400 vehicles per day as a very low volume local road. =Horton to Caldwell= State maintenance begins at an intersection with CR 255 / CR 265 in Horton, an unincorporated community in rural St. Francis County. The highway runs due east, crossing the L'Anguille River lowlands and adjacent swamps. The highway continues east through row crop agricultural fields. It turns right toward the small town of Caldwell, crossing the Union Pacific Railway tracks shortly after entering the municipal limits. Just east of this crossing, Highway 261 intersects Highway 1, where it terminates. In 2016, the AADT was 750 near the route's midpoint.

It was built during the 1st century BC to honor Caecilia Metella who was the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus, a consul in 69 BC, and wife of Marcus Licinius Crassus who served under Julius Caesar and was the son of the famous triumvir Marcus Crassus.Coarelli, Filippo (2008) Rome and Environs: An Arch√¶ological Guide. pg 393. . Retrieved 7 June 2014. The Tomb of Caecilia is one of the most well known and well preserved monuments along the Via Appia and a popular tourist site. In 2013, the museum circuit of the Baths of Caracalla, Villa of the Quintilii, and the Tomb of Caecilia Metella was the twenty-second most visited site in Italy, with 245,613 visitors and a total gross income of ‚Ç¨883,344. Ministry of Heritage and Culture, museum visitors and revenue Description Located on top of a hill along the Via Appia, the Tomb of Caecilia Metella consists of a cylindrical drum, or rotunda, atop a square podium with the Caetani Castle (Castrum) attached at the rear. The square podium stands at 8.3 meters tall with the cylindrical drum standing at 12 m. The monument in totality stands at a height of 21.7 meters tall. The diameter of the circular drum is 29.5 m, equivalent to 100 Roman feet. On the outside of the monument, an inscription can be seen reading \\"CAECILIAE Q¬∑CRETICI¬∑F  METELLAE¬∑CRASSI\\" indicating to whom this tomb was dedicated. Further up the monument, decorations can be seen depicting festoons and bucrania, heads of bulls, which were the inspiration for the area being named Capo Di Bove, meaning head of the bovine. At the top of the monument, medieval battlements can be seen from the time when the tomb was used as a fortress. At the rear, the Caetani Castle is attached to the tomb. The castle originally was three levels: ground level, first level, and second level. It is unknown what the second level was used for but the first floor was used for the elite gentlemen as evidenced by fireplaces and refined goods.Archaeological Study of Castrum Caetani The castle is now used to display various decorations from the monument. MausoleumStructure= The foundation of the Tomb of Caecilia Metella rests partially on tuff rock and partially on lava rock. The lava rock is part of ancient lava flow from the Alban Hills that covered the area 260,000 years ago.Adams, William Henry Davenport (1872) Temples, Tombs, and Monuments of Ancient Greece and Rome: A Description and a History of Some of the Most Remarkable Memorials of Classical Architecture pg. 194. The core of the podium was cast in several layers of concrete, ranging from .7 to .85 m thick. The thickness of each layer corresponds with the height of the travertine facing blocks that surrounded the podium as the travertine was used as a frame in order to help the concrete layers form.Gerding, Henrik (2002) The Tomb of Caecilia Metella:Tumulus, Tropaeum, and Thymele. The rotunda was built in this same fashion, travertine blocks on the outermost section with cement poured in the middle to give the concrete some structure and then covered in Travertine revetment, most of which has been stripped away. While the walls of the tower are 24 ft thick, comparatively the adjoining castle of the Gaetani was made of a thin wall of tufa. Originally the top of the monument would have been a cone shaped earthen mound as conical shapes were common with Roman rotundas but the earthen mound has long been replaced by medieval battlements. The Roman concrete was made up of semi-liquid mortar and aggregate, which consisted of broken pieces of stone or bricks. The aggregate was made up of rather large pieces of stone (about the size of a fist) compared to modern cement which is finely ground to create a smooth, flat surface. Mortar and concrete were alternated in the construction as the semi- liquid mortar would bind the stone pieces together. The mortar used at this tomb utilized the lava rock beneath the monument as a substitute for sand in the concrete. The lava rock worked as well as sand and was more abundant versus the difficult to find sand. =Interior= The interior of the Tomb of Caecilia Metella can be separated into 4 sections: the cella, the upper and lower corridors, and the west compartment. The most important being the cella which was used for funerary purposes and for \\"housing\\" the dead. The cella is a tall, circular shaft rising all the way through the center of both the podium and the rotunda. The cella is about 6.6 m in diameter at the bottom but tapers as it rises to a 5.6 m diameter at the top. The top features an oculus allowing for light. Throughout the cella, there are over 143 cut outs, divided into 12 rows of 10-14, in the walls of the cella that were used as putlog holes in the creation of the monument. The upper corridors is believed to be the main entrance to the cella. =Exterior= The upper section of the rotunda is decorated quite minimally with a marble frieze of bucrania, oxen heads, and garlands. Beneath the frieze is the famous inscription \\"CAECILIAE Q¬∑CRETICI¬∑F  METELLAE¬∑CRASSI\\" meaning \\"To Caecilia Metella, daughter of Quintus Creticus, [and wife] of Crassus\\". Decorations were very popular on funerary altars and votive offerings and the most famous example are identified in the frieze of carved ox skulls and festoons on the inside of the fence.Queen of Roads: Appian Way Three types of bull heads can be distinguished: complete bovine head, skull of bull but still covered with skin, and a full skeletal skull. The inclusion of the naked skull is indicative of the termination of use of the complete bull skull and the skull with skin occurred around 30 BC and the inclusion of the use of particular bull heads allows for an approximate date to be made, as bull heads seen on dated monuments can be compared. The bull heads and garlands indicate and verify the timing of the creation of the monument. During the time period, the Roman decoration of bull heads was shifting and thus the representation of particular bull heads approximate the date. =Sarcophagus= Today, there is a marble sarcophagus located in Palazzo Farnese that is purportedly from the Tomb of Caecilia Metella. According to literary sources, it was found in the cella and had been there since before the construction of the Caetani Castle. However, there is no definitive evidence to verify the sarcophagus as the sarcophagus of Caecilia Metella and many historians believe the sarcophagus does not belong to the monument and had been found in the surrounding area of the mausoleum rather than inside it. Recently, the sarcophagus was the object of a detailed study and the author of this study dates sarcophagus between AD 180 and 190. Further evidence suggesting this to not be the sarcophagus of Caecilia Metella is at the time of Caecilia Metella's death, cremation was the typical burial custom and a funerary urn is expected rather than a sarcophagus. In addition, records from 1697 of the Farnese Collection state the sarcophagus was registered without a specified provenience indicating even at the time, historians were unsure of the relationship between the sarcophagus and the tomb. Castrum Between 1302 and 1303, the Caetani, or Gaetani, family aided by Pope Boniface VIII bought the estate of Capo di Bove, which was all the land surrounding and including the Tomb of Caecilia Metella, and built a fortified camp, or castrum, next to the tomb replacing a preceding 11th century building. History of Castrum Caetani The castrum's construction included the building of stables, houses, warehouses, the church of St. Nicholas, and the palace of the Caetani as well as adding the medieval battlements to the top of the tomb thus transforming the tomb into a defensive tower. Sadly, the remnants of the Caetani only include the Church of St. Nicholas, parts of the Caetani Palace, and the medieval battlements. The Caetani used this fort to control the traffic on the road and to collect exorbitant tolls. In the fourteenth century the castle was passed to the Savelli, and to the Orsini who held it until 1435, after which it became the property of the Roman Senate.History of Castrum Caetani According to Gerding, the monument was abandoned in 1485. Over the centuries, the two monuments endured numerous attempts of destruction in order to repurpose their materials. However, the two monuments protected one another from destruction. During the Renaissance, the monuments were saved as they were valued for the castrum while during Romanticism, the tomb, with its charm, allowed the survival of the castrum.

Caecilia seems to have taken after her mother. =Marriage and scandals= In 53 BC, Metella Celer was married to Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, a conservative politician, allied to her father's family. Like her mother, Metella did not content herself with a simple married life. Briefly after the wedding she started an affair with Publius Cornelius Dolabella, a man of the opposite political spectrum. Spinther divorced her in 45 BC in the midst of a huge scandal. Cicero bitterly discusses the affair in his letters, because at the time, his daughter Tullia was Dolabella's wife. Metella went back to her family in absolute disgrace. She was still in her twenties and very beautiful. Her cousins did not hesitate in using her for political conspiracies. Metella seduced several of Julius Caesar's intimate friends, in order to get the family name cleared after the defeat of the Optimates in the battles of Pharsalus and Munda.

The film covers the relations between Lebanese Australians and Anglo Australians in parts of Western Sydney. Parts of the film focus on the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia between Lebanese Australians and Anglo Australians. Basha and Field met and began working on the screenplay in 2001. Principal photography began in 2008, taking place in and around the Sydney suburbs of Guildford and Parramatta. The film was released on 26 February 2009. It received generally positive reviews from critics. It also caused some controversy after two violent incidents caused the film to be temporarily withdrawn from some cinemas. A sequel, The Combination: Redemption, was released on 7 February 2019. Plot In 2005, after serving time in jail, Lebanese Australian John Morkos returns home. He finds work as a cleaner at a boxing gym, owned by an Aboriginal man. John also meets and begins a relationship with Sydney, an Anglo Australian after saving her from being assaulted by two men. John soon finds that his younger brother, Charlie, has been involved in fights between his Lebanese friends and the white students at school. Fearing that Charlie is going down the path he has been on, John tries to talk some sense into Charlie. Charlie ignores John's warnings and with his friend Zeus start selling methamphetamines for Ibo, the local drug kingpin. Not long after that, another one of Charlie's friends, Tom, punches a stranger in the head, after playing and losing an arcade game to him. The stranger's friend gets involved in the fight and later on Tom's friends join in. The stranger's friend holds Zeus in a headlock during the fight and while doing so Tom stabs him with a knife to break Zeus free from the headlock and ends up in jail. At school, tensions between the Lebanese and Anglo boys increase. The Anglos, led by Scott, gang-bash one of the Lebanese boys, breaking his jaw and nose. The rest of the Lebanese boys decide to take revenge on Scott but are persuaded by John not to do anything, but Zeus ignores his warnings to later confront Scott at a nightclub. Meanwhile, the relationship between John and Sydney blossoms but ends when Sydney's racist mother threatens to kick her out of the house if she doesn't stop seeing John. The two have a fight, with John unwilling to tell Sydney of his past life. The couple soon make up after realising they both made a mistake. John also finds Charlie's stash of drugs and flushes it down the toilet. At a nightclub, Zeus starts a fight with Scott, punches him in the head and ends up shooting and killing him despite Charlie's attempts to dissuade him. Zeus is arrested by the police. Unable to come up with the drug money for Ibo, a drive-by shooting is carried out on the Morkos home by Ibo. John turns to the owner of the boxing gym for the money which he delivers to Ibo, but Charlie is murdered by Ibo with a shotgun when walking home from school. John avenges Charlie's death by savagely beating Ibo, and in the process, nearly killing him. John decides to leave Ibo's fate to Ibo's neighbours, who also hate the drug dealer, and returns home to his family and a pregnant Sydney. Cast * George Basha as John, a Lebanese Australian man just out of jail * Firass Dirani as Charlie, John's younger brother * Doris Younane as Mary, John and Charlie's mother * Clare Bowen as Sydney, John's girlfriend * Michael Denkha as Ibo, a drug dealer * Vaughn White as Scott, the leader of the Anglo boys * Katrina Risteska as Anna, Scott's girlfriend and Charlie's love interest * Ali Haider as Zeus, one of Charlie's friends * Rasheed Dehan as Tom, one of Charlie's friends * Guang Li as Nipper, one of Charlie's friends * John Brumpton as Mr. Roberts, Sydney's Father * Ruth McGowan as Mrs. Roberts, Sydney's Mother Production The film is based partly on writer George Basha's life experiences of growing up in the suburbs surrounding Guildford and Parramatta. Basha wrote the script while recovering from a broken leg he got while playing soccer. Basha met David Field in late 2001 after the director sold a second- hand car to a friend of Basha's. The two met for lunch and where Basha showed Field his script. Within two days, Field decided he would direct the film himself. Field originally did not want Basha to star in the film, but Basha auditioned for the role of John Morkos and won the part. Clare Bowen, who was a student in an acting class Field previously taught, was called by Field to audition for the role of Sydney after he was unable to find the right actress for the part. The film also features a group of non-professional actors. For the roles of Charlie's high school mates, the producers place an ad in the Parramatta papers. Field says \\"it wasn't about using non-actors, it was about using actors who'd been waiting for the opportunity to act.\\" Vaughn White, who plays Scott, was found while mowing lawns for community service. The film was made on a budget and without any government funding. After the finance was raised the film began production in early 2008. The film was shot in 21 days following a two-week rehearsal period. It was shot on a Red One digital film camera in and around Parramatta and Guildford. Influenced by the visual style of films in the Revisionist Western genre, the film makes use of the widescreen format, low angles and dramatic lighting to \\"enhance [the] hero's standing among those less honourable\\" and allow \\"dynamic compositions of landscape and character.\\" It was edited in Final Cut Pro before being graded in the digital intermediate process. Reception The film generally received positive reviews upon its release. At the Movies critics David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz gave the film 4 and 4¬Ω out of 5 stars, respectively. Stratton said \\"the story it tells is so moving and so honest\\". Time Off's Adam Brunes said that it was \\"refreshing to see a homegrown film that doesn't resort to cultural stereotypes, and a film about race that doesn't preach.\\" ABC Radio National's Jason Di Rosso said that the film had \\"some clunky, overwritten dialogue and poor pacing\\" but that \\"as the plot crescendos [‚Ä¶] The Combination transcends its flaws.\\" Marc Fennell reviewing for Triple J gave the film two out of five stars, praising the ambition of the film, but criticizing several aspects including the love story, the acting by the non- professional cast and Bowen, Labib Jammal's music and the characterisation of Sydney's parents. The acting by the cast of young actors received praise, as did Toby Oliver's cinematography. The film was temporarily pulled from Greater Union cinemas in New South Wales after two violent incidents in the film's opening week. In the first incident on 26 February 2009, a security guard was hit in the head and hospitalised after asking a patron to put out his cigarette. In the second incident on 28 February, a staff member was injured in a fight that broke out after patrons asked other patrons to be quiet towards the end of the film. The film was reopened at the cinemas on 4 March 2009 following the addition of extra security measures.  Sequel  A sequel titled The Combination: Redemption was released on 7 February 2019. The film was also written by Basha and directed by Field, with Basha reprising his role as John Morkos. The sequel takes place six years after the original film.

Also known as the \\"Butcher of Vilnius\\", he created and ruled the Vilna Ghetto until July 1943, shortly before its liquidation. Murer was born in Sankt Georgen ob Murau, Austria in 1912, and joined the NSDAP at the age of 26. He trained with Hitler Youth in Nuremberg before being transferred to Vilnius, where between 1941 and 1943 he was the deputy of Territorial Commissioner (Gebietskommissar) Hans Christian Hingst in charge of \\"Jewish affairs\\". He was known as a sadist who showed special cruelty towards the Jews. Vilnius, which was known as \\"the Jerusalem of Lithuania\\" before the war, had a Jewish population of about 80,000. After the war around 250 Jews were living there. The rest had been murdered by the SS and Murer was instrumental in organizing these killings. On July 1, 1943, Murer was replaced by Gestapo Oberscharf√ºhrer Bruno Kittel, who was brought in to liquidate the ghetto. After the war, Murer moved to Steiermark in Austria. Near his residence in Admont there was a camp for displaced persons. In 1947 one of these DPs recognized Murer and British forces arrested Murer. In December 1948 he was deported to the Soviet Union since Vilnius had been under Soviet jurisdiction. He was found guilty of having murdered Soviet citizens and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor. As a part of the Austrian State Treaty, he was released in 1955 and thus returned to Austria. Simon Wiesenthal managed to get him prosecuted again in 1963. The trial that took place in Graz, Austria, lasted for a week and ended with the acquittal of Murer. The trial was the subject of the 2018 film Murer ‚Äì Anatomie eines Prozesses (Murer ‚Äì Anatomy of a Trial). Murer died in Gaishorn am See, Austria in 1994.

According to the authors, economists have tended to de-emphasize the importance of emotional factors, as the effects of emotions are difficult to model and quantify. The book asserts that a variety of otherwise puzzling questions can be answered once one allows for the effect that emotional drives, or \\"animal spirits,\\" have on economic factors. Akerlof and Shiller began writing the book in 2003. While finishing the work after the Financial crisis of 2007-2008 the authors set themselves the additional aim of promoting a much more aggressive US government intervention to alleviate the crises than has been seen as of February 2009. They repeatedly stress the need for decisive action targeted at restoring credit flows, and that the overall stimulus from the government needs to be much larger than would otherwise be the case due to very low levels of confidence about short and medium term economic prospects. Synopsis The Preface recalls Keynes' use of the phrase \\"animal spirits,\\" which he used to describe the psychological forces that partly explain why the economy does not behave in the manner predicted by classical economics ‚Äî a system of thought that expects economic actors to behave as unemotional rational beings. The authors assert that the Keynesian Revolution was emasculated as Keynesians progressively relegated the importance of animal spirits to accommodate the views of economists who preferred the simpler classical or neo-classical system. The preface goes on to describe how Keynes' ideas suggest the economy will function best with a moderately high level of government intervention, which they compare to a happy home where children thrive with parents that are neither too authoritarian (as in a Marxist economy) nor too permissive (as in a neoliberal economy). The authors state that recent research now supports the concept of animal spirits much more robustly than Keynes was able to, and they express the hope that fellow economists can be convinced of this, thus reducing the internecine disputes that prevent their discipline from providing the clear support that politicians need for the aggressive action required to fix the 2008‚Äì2009 economic crises. =Part one= The five key animal spirits are treated here, each assigned their own chapter. Chapter 1 the authors discuss confidence, which they say is the most important animal spirit to know about if one wishes to understand the economy. Chapter 2 is about the desire for fairness, an emotional drive that can cause people to make decisions that aren‚Äôt in their economic best interests. Chapter 3 discusses corruption and bad faith, and how growing awareness of these practices can contribute to a recession, in addition to the direct harm the practices cause themselves. Chapter 4 presents evidence that, in contrast to monetarist theory, many people are at least partially under the money illusion, the tendency for people to ignore the effects of inflation. Workers for example will forgo a pay rise even when prices are rising, if they know that their firm is facing challenging conditions‚Äîbut they are much less willing to accept a pay cut even when prices are falling. Chapter 5 is about the importance of stories in determining behaviour. Such as the repeatedly told story that house prices will always rise, which caused many additional people to invest in housing following the dot com bust of 2000. =Part two= Here the authors discuss eight important questions about the economy, which they assert can only be satisfactorily answered by a theory that takes animal spirits into account. Each question has its own chapter. Chapter 6 is about why recessions happen. The authors assert that the business cycle can be explained by rising confidence in the upswing eventually leading investors to make rash decisions and ultimately encouraging corruption, until eventually panic appears and confidence evaporates, triggering a recession. There is a discussion about feedback loops between animal spirits and real returns available, which help explain the intensity of both the up and down swing of the cycle. Chapter 7 discusses why animal spirits make central banks a necessity, and there is a post script about how they can intervene to help with the current crises. Chapter 8 tackles the reasons for unemployment, which the authors say is partly due to animal spirits such as concerns for fairness and the money illusion. Chapter 9 is about why there is a trade off between unemployment and inflation. The authors show how effects of animal spirits refutes the monetarist theory that there is a natural rate of employment which it is not desirable to exceed. Chapter 10 is about why people don't consider the future rationally in their decisions about savings. Chapter 11 presents an explanation for why asset prices and investment flows are so volatile. Chapter 12 discusses why real estate markets go through cycles, with periods of often rapid price increase interspaced by falls. Chapter 13 suggests that animal spirits can be used to explain the persistence of poverty among ethnic minorities, describing how working class minorities have different stories about how the world works and their place in it, compared to working class white people. The authors argue that the effects of animal spirits make a strong case for affirmative action. Chapter 14 is a conclusion where the authors state that the cumulative evidence they have presented in the preceding chapters overwhelmingly shows that the neo classical view of the economy, which allows little or no role for animal spirits, is unreliable. They state that an effective response to the current economic crises must take into account the effects of animal spirits. Critical reception Reviewing the book for the Financial Times, Clive Crook write \\"it is a fine book at exactly the right time.... Animal Spirits carries its ambition lightly‚Äîbut is ambitious nonetheless. Economists will see it as a kind of manifesto.\\" Andrew Rosenblum from The New York Observer says \\"Animal Spirits is most compelling when the authors summon all the key behavioral patterns to explain vast, complex phenomena such as the Great Depression.... Animal Spirits...is aimed squarely at the general reader, and rightly so: Macroeconomics is now everybody's business‚Äîthe banks are playing with our money.\\" An exception to the numerous glowing reviews the book received was a lengthy critique published in The New Republic by the Judge Richard Posner. The authors responded to Posner's criticisms in an article published a few weeks later in the same periodical. And, on the same day and in the same periodical, Posner replied to the authors' response. Animal Spirits was shortlisted for the 2009 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2007, 21 different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. In the issue of Billboard dated January 6, Carrie Underwood was at number one with Some Hearts, the album's 19th week in the top spot. Having first reached number one in late 2005, the album returned to the top spot several times over the next 18 months. It was the biggest-selling country music of both 2006 and 2007. Underwood returned to the top spot in November with her next album Carnival Ride, making her one of two acts to achieve two number ones during the year; the other was the trio Rascal Flatts, who spent two weeks at number one with Me and My Gang in January and then returned to the peak position in October with Still Feels Good, which spent four weeks atop the chart. Me and My Gang,Still Feels Good and Carnival Ride all topped the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, as did albums by Tim McGraw, Toby Keith, Reba McEntire and the Eagles. Four acts reached number one for the first time in 2007, most notably teenage vocalist Taylor Swift, whose self- titled debut album had the year's longest unbroken run at number one, spending eight consecutive weeks in the top spot. Swift would quickly become a major star in the country field before moving into the pop music market, where she would become one of the most successful artists in the world. The three other first-time country chart-toppers of 2007 each spent a single week in the top spot: Jason Michael Carroll with Waitin' in the Country in February, former American Idol finalist Bucky Covington with his self-titled album in May, and Jason Aldean with Relentless in June. The year's final chart-topper was Long Road Out of Eden by the Eagles, which entered the chart at number one in the issue of Billboard dated November 17. It spent two weeks in the top spot, was displaced for two weeks by Garth Brooks's compilation album The Ultimate Hits, then returned to number one and remained there for the remainder of the year. It was the band's first studio album since 1979's The Long Run; having been inactive since 1980, the band had reformed in 1994 but did not release any new material until 2007.

Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against Wu, and imperial troops under Li Su were eventually able to defeat and capture him. He was delivered to the Tang capital Chang'an and executed there.  Background  The biographies of Wu Yuanji in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang conflict as to when he was born ‚Äî with the Old Book of Tang indicating that he was born in 783 and the New Book of Tang indicating that he was born in 793. In any case, a major part of Wu Yuanji's life would have been spent during the time when his father Wu Shaoyang served under Wu Shaocheng the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhangyi Circuit ‚Äî who was not biologically related to Wu Yuanji but who was endeared to Wu Shaoyang and treated Wu Shaoyang as a cousin. In 809, when Wu Shaocheng was seriously ill, Wu Shaoyang killed Wu Shaocheng's son Wu Yuanqing (Âê≥ÂÖÉÊÖ∂) and took over control of the circuit. Then-reigning Emperor Xianzong, already engaged in a campaign against another warlord, Wang Chengzong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), was unable to act against Wu Shaoyang, and thus made Wu Shaoyang acting military governor and then military governor of Zhangyi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Wu Yuanji was Wu Shaoyang's oldest son, and he had at least two younger brothers. While Wu Shaoyang governed the circuit, Wu Yuanji was made the acting prefect of Zhangyi's capital prefecture Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û).  Campaign against the imperial government  Wu Shaoyang's death and aftermaths = In 814, Wu Shaoyang died. Wu Yuanji kept Wu Shaoyang's death a secret and reported to the imperial government that Wu Shaoyang was ill; meanwhile, he took over control of the circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Previously, Wu Shaoyang's staff members Su Zhao (ËòáÂÖÜ) and Yang Yuanqing (Ê•äÂÖÉÂçø), as well as his officer Hou Weiqing (‰æØÊÉüÊ∏Ö), had all recommended that Wu Shaoyang go to the capital Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Xianzong, to show submission to the imperial government, and after Wu Yuanji took over, he suspected them of betraying him. He thus killed Su and imprisoned Hou. At that time, Yang was at Chang'an, and hearing this news, he informed the chancellor Li Jifu of all of Zhangyi's strengths and weaknesses. At Yang's suggestion, the messengers that Zhangyi had sent to the other circuits were detained where they were. Further, contrary to customs that, when a major general died, that the emperor would declare a day of mourning, the imperial government did not do so, but mobilized the armies of the circuits around Zhangyi to prepare for a campaign. With these events occurring, Wu Yuanji killed Yang's wife and four sons and used their blood to paint the archery range. He made Wu Shaocheng's son-in-law Dong Chongzhi (Ëë£ÈáçË≥™) his main strategist. Meanwhile, with Li Jifu advocating a campaign against Zhangyi, Emperor Xianzong prepared for one. At the suggestion of another chancellor, Zhang Hongjing, Emperor Xianzong declared a day of mourning for Wu Shaoyang and sent the official Li Junhe (ÊùéÂêõ‰Ωï) to Zhangyi to mourn Wu Shaoyang, to see how Wu Yuanji would react. Wu Yuanji, however, refused Li Junhe admission to the circuit, and further mobilized his army. He attacked Wuyang (ËàûÈôΩ, in modern Luohe, Henan) and slaughtered its population; burned Ye County (ËëâÁ∏£, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan); and pillaged Lushan (È≠ØÂ±±, in modern Pingdingshan) and Xiangcheng (Ë•ÑÂüé, in modern Xuchang, Henan). Li Junhe was forced to return to Chang'an. = Initial stages = Emperor Xianzong put the general Yan Shou (Âö¥Á∂¨) in command of the overall operations against Zhangyi and mobilized the armies of 16 circuits. In spring 815, after some small victories against Zhangyi, Yan became careless, and the Zhangyi forces fought back, defeating him at Ciqiu (Á£Å‰∏ò, in modern Zhumadian), forcing him to flee back to Tang Prefecture (ÂîêÂ∑û, in modern Zhumadian). The Zhangyi forces also defeated the troops from Shou Prefecture (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), forcing the prefect of Shou Prefecture, Linghu Tong (‰ª§ÁãêÈÄö), to flee back to Shou's main city, while the Zhangyi forces slaughtered the Shou troops remaining on the border. Meanwhile, Wu Yuanji sought help from Wang Chengzong (the imperial campaign against whom ended in 810 with Emperor Xianzong agreeing to formally make Wang military governor and Wang agreeing to formally submit to imperial authority) and Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Both Wang and Li pleaded with Emperor Xianzong on Wu's behalf, seeking his exoneration. Emperor Xianzong refused. In response, Li sent his soldiers to conduct guerilla warfare in the regions of the eastern capital Luoyang. Later, believing that assassinating the pro-campaign chancellor Wu Yuanheng and the official Pei Du would cause the other officials to advocate peace, Li also sent assassins to kill Wu Yuanheng and Pei; Wu Yuanheng died in the attack, but Pei was only wounded. Emperor Xianzong subsequently made Pei a chancellor and became further resolved to continue the campaign. Further, not yet learning of Li's involvement and believing that Wang was behind the assassinations, he ordered another campaign against Wang. With Yan not making much headway against Zhangyi forces, in late 815, Emperor Xianzong put Han Hong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) in charge of the operations against Zhangyi instead, but it was said that Han did not fully embrace the campaign and did not work hard toward Zhangyi's destruction. With the imperial troops converging, both sides had victories ‚Äî although it was noted by historians that the imperial generals often exaggerated their victories against Zhangyi forces and hid their defeats from the emperor. The imperial generals Li Guangyan the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang) and Wu Chongyin the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Pingdingshan) were having success against Zhangyi forces, but in spring 816, Zhangyi forces dealt Gao Xiayu (È´òÈúûÂØì) the military governor of Tangsuideng Circuit (ÂîêÈö®ÈÑß, headquartered at Tang Prefecture) a major defeat, such that Gao barely escaped with his life. Emperor Xianzong demoted Gao and Li Xun (ÊùéÈÅú) the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) and replaced Gao with Yuan Zi. When Yuan subsequently took a passive stance against Zhangyi, however, Emperor Xianzong replaced him with Li Su. Decades later, after Du Mu interviewed Dong Chongzhi with regard to his memories about these years of the Zhangyi campaign, Du recounted what Dong told him:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. = Defeat by Li Su = As Li Su was not well known, and the Zhangyi forces had defeated Gao Xiayu and Yuan Zi previously, it was said that the Zhangyi forces did not consider Li a threat and did not take much precautions against him. Li, after receiving reinforcements from several circuits, began to carry out military actions in which he targeted Zhangyi officers, captured them, and then treated them well and incorporated them into his command structure, using their familiarity with Zhangyi's defenses against Zhangyi. Such Zhangyi officers he thus captured included Ding Shiliang (‰∏ÅÂ£´ËâØ), Chen Guangqia (Èô≥ÂÖâÊ¥Ω), Wu Xiulin (Âê≥ÁßÄÁê≥), Li Xian (ÊùéÊÜ≤, whose name Li Su changed to Li Zhongyi (ÊùéÂø†Áæ©)), and Li You. Meanwhile, with Zhangyi's food supplies running low, the people were forced to initially resort to eating water caltrop, fish, freshwater turtles, birds, and beasts, but after those plants and animals ran out, the people started surrendering to the imperial forces en masse. The Zhangyi forces, believing that detaining the people would merely lead to quicker drain on resources, did not stop them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. Meanwhile, in addition to Li Su, Li Guangyan and Wu Chongyin were also continuing to deal Wu Yuanji defeats, capturing the important city of Yancheng (ÈÉæÂüé, in modern Luohe) in summer 817. Wu Yuanji put Dong Chongzhi in charge of his strongest army, which rode mules, and Dong was stationed at Huiqu (Ê¥ÑÊõ≤, near Yancheng) to defend against further attacks by imperial forces from Yancheng. Pei Du volunteered to serve as the overall commander of the operations, and Emperor Xianzong agreed. Pei soon arrived on the front and personally monitored the troop advancements. With Zhangyi in great difficulty, Wu Yuanji offered to surrender to Emperor Xianzong, and Emperor Xianzong was initially inclined to accept and promised not to execute Wu, but with Dong opposing capitulation, Wu's surrender never came. On November 27, 815,November 815 Sinica.edu at dusk, Li Su launched an attack, from his then-base of Wencheng Fence (ÊñáÊàêÊüµ, in modern Zhumadian), and, after dusk, after destroying the bridges between Huiqu and Cai Prefecture, and with a major winter snowstorm serving as cover, he advanced quickly to Cai Prefecture. With Li You and Li Zhongyi leading the forward attack, Li Su's forward soldiers climbed up the city walls and surprised the defending soldiers, killing them without engagements and then opening the city to allow the remainder of Li Su's soldiers to enter. Li Su's forces then attacked Wu Yuanji's fortified mansion. Wu Yuanji still commanded his own guards to defend against the attack. During the battle, Li Su, believing that Wu Yuanji's last hope would be if Dong returned quickly to save him, personally visited Dong's house and asked Dong's son Dong Chuandao (Ëë£ÂÇ≥ÈÅì) to go to Dong Chongzhi's camp to express Li Su's good faith. Dong Chongzhi immediately abandoned his troops and returned to Cai Prefecture to surrender to Li Su. On November 29, with even the residents of Cai Prefecture joining the attack on Wu's headquarters, Wu surrendered. Li Su put him under arrest and delivered him to Chang'an.  Death  On December 12, Emperor Xianzong ascended the palace gate to receive Wu Yuanji as a captive. He had Wu delivered to the imperial ancestral temples, as if to be offered as a sacrifice, and then had him beheaded under a lone willow. During Wu's campaign against the imperial government, Li Shidao had sent his officer Liu Yanping (ÂäâÊôèÂπ≥) to Zhangyi as a messenger to observe Wu's status. After Liu returned to Pinglu, he gave this report to Li Shidao as far as his observation of Wu was concerned:  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 145. * New Book of Tang, vol. 214. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 239, 240.

H√ºttner responded to this by writing: \\"the goal of the project was to inspire a more diverse and profound discussion about the meaning of artworks, exhibitions and the role of the artist.\\" Over the years, the project has gained recognition and has been hailed as being ahead of its time and has been widely appreciated for its visionary qualities in readers on curation and research on the subject of art and exhibition making.\\"Tundro, znaczy wolnosc\\" Marta Eloy Cichocka, Biuletyn 09/2006 (58), p.48-50, Poland Background Installation view from I am a Curator Chisenhale Gallery, 13 November 2003, Muller Kneer Associates H√ºttner carried out a series of exhibitions that democratized or investigated the curatorial process in the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium.A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, Zingmagazine 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York, United States Many of these were collaborative and took place at the Gallery Konstakuten in Stockholm, The Hood Gallery in Los Angeles but also in galleries and public spaces in London, New York City and Vancouver and involved artists from different generations and included Geoffrey Farmer, Brian Jungen, Lenke Rothman, Neil Goldstein and curators like Reid Shier and Tone O Nielsen.Amelie Nordenfelt, \\"Introduction\\", Curatorial Mutiny, p. 9, edited by Per H√ºttner, 2003, 120 pages, texts by: Per H√ºttner, Amelie Nordenfelt, Gavin wade, Tone O.

Gerrie van Noord, design Marie Proyard, Published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden. Basic structure During six weeks people or groups of people with no prior experience in exhibition making undertook 36 investigative exercises into the process of putting together an exhibition. From the outset, the idea was to create an exhibition each day, but quickly the focus moved to investigate the 57 artworks as a resource. In order to realize this strategy the artist developed some basic concepts: Curator of the Day: The daily slots were administered through an application process through which we tried to give as many different people as possible, in relation to occupation, age, sex, social and ethnic background. More often than not, the Curator of Day was a small group. Meaning that in the end roughly 70 people were curators. The Gallery Crew: The Gallery Crew was the Curators of the Day's aid in developing their ideas and the project that they wanted to realize during the day. The Curator of the Day was not allowed to touch the artwork, except in those cases when this was an integral part of the piece. All the handling and mounting of the work was carried out by the Gallery Crew. The crew was also responsible for informing the visitors to the gallery about the project and answering questions. Support Structure: Support Structure hosted all the artwork. It was mobile and it was also used to display work, as well as change the size and appearance of the space. It incorporated two tables and half a dozen chairs that could also be used as plinths to present work on.http://www.supportstructure.org But Celine Condorelli and Gavin Wade took their brief further and allowed Support Structure be a questioning and critical tool and an important aspect of the process of the project. The structure took the centre stage, but in an unexpected way the Curators of the Day remained strangely blind to the eleven meter long monster object on wheels and few, if any, references were made to it in their reports.Support Structures, Celine Condorelli, p. 115-128, Sternberg Press (2009), The two also offered objects and lists of what to do if the Curator of the Day gets stuck and included phone numbers to well-known contemporary curators.Paul O'Neill, p.168, Metropolis Rise: New Art from London, edited by Anthony Gross and Jen Wu, , London 2006. The Selectors: To provide a dynamic collection for the Curator of the Day to choose from, six people were asked to select artwork for I Am a Curator. Each devised a different approach for his or her selection. They were Patrick Bernier, Melanie Keen, Lisa Le Feuvre, Tone O. Nielsen, Reid Shier and Per H√ºttner. The Interface Cards: A5-sized plastic cards were designed and realized by American artist Scott Rigby. For each artwork available for selection there was one corresponding Interface Card. The Interface Cards along with the website (which used the same design) were the main tools for the Curator of the Day to select artwork and devise their exhibition. The Website: All the artwork available for selection could be browsed on Chisenhale Gallery's website.http://www.chisenhale.org.uk There was also continually updated photographic documentation of the exhibitions created by the Curators of the Day. The exhibitions and the audience Installation view from I am a Curator Chisenhale Gallery, 12 November 2003, Embassy of Work with Me/√Öb√§ke Installation view from I am a Curator Chisenhale Gallery, 14 December 2003, Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura Installation view from I am a Curator Chisenhale Gallery, 13 December 2003, Sebastian Roach, Art for Alcohol Day Installation view from I am a Curator Chisenhale Gallery, 11 December 2003, Anton Nikolotov Each of the 36 exhibitions realized within the framework of I am a Curator took on very different forms and used the artwork and the space in very different ways. Artist Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew describes an exhibition that had great impact on the development of the project: > \\"Embassy of Work With Me (√•.b.√§.k.e /RCA), emptied Support Structure of all > its contents, Jokers and artworks, and developed a chromatic scale around > the walls of the gallery (the structure having been pushed to the corner). > The colour of the individual group members‚Äô clothes determined which works > they had responsibility for placing. The process had a very easily achieved > self-perpetuating logic that extended to colour-coding drill batteries, > masking tape, spirit levels, any tools that we may have set down for a > moment. The colour-coding also included the covers of the CDs bought from > the local junk shop in order to complete Sam Ely and Lynn Harris‚Äô Playlist, > along with all the book covers from C√©line Condorelli‚Äôs and Gavin Wade's > Joker selection of books. This seemed the most natural and successful > exercise in devolution and levelling democratization that occurred during > the run of the show. The ‚Äòartworks‚Äô suffered less in this melee than they > often did when not surrounded by a chromatic sea of things; they were > scrutinized and investigated by the curating group.\\" H√ºttner talks about a few of the key experiences among the 36 exhibitions: > ‚ÄùI have to mention Anton Nikolotov‚Äôs project (11/12/03). He wanted the work > to be selected democratically. He thus devoted the whole day discussing with > the visitors which works should be displayed. Each visitor who was present > at a given moment was given some time to voice why a certain piece should or > shouldn't be shown. When everyone had presented their case, the group voted > and notes were taken on the different ideas and how many votes the different > pieces got. In the end the only show that was presented was one made up of > these notes shown in the massive empty space. This approach allowed I Am a > Curator to be taken to another level. The boundaries between Curator of the > Day and audience vanished entirely. It was wonderful to see how the process > of democratization could be taken one step further than had originally been > foreseen. This democratic process was at once extremely rewarding, but also > hugely tiring. Rarely have I seen the members of the Gallery Crew leave so > happy and tired. It was also great to see how visitors tended to stay for > hours to join the discussion. At one point 15 people were present for the > vote.\\" Other shows included Sebastian Roach's Art for Wine Day 13/12/03 which took quite a nihilist approach to the task of selecting work:\\"Sebastian Roach is a Curator\\", e-mail sent out to Chisenhale mailing list, December 2003 > ‚ÄùIn exchange for the donation of a bottle of wine (or beer, or spirits ‚Äì > even a miniature, the important thing is the token) a visitor can select and > display any piece of work in the show. Alternatively they can donate a new > piece of work and I will give them a bottle of wine in exchange for it. In > addition, through the course of the day I will install myself in an ‚Äòoffice‚Äô > created by using the versatile structure as walls drinking wine, smoking > cigarettes and writing. What I write will be spontaneous and in response ‚Äì > directly, indirectly, or entirely tenuously ‚Äì to the work, the environment > and the situation, and will obviously also be tempered by the increasing > consumption of alcohol. Whatever writing I do produce at the end of the day > will also be available in exchange for wine.\\" The diversity of the Curator of the Day and how they interacted with the work can be exemplified by H√ºttner's endnote in the catalogue: > ‚Äù The data that I Am a Curator generated is in itself something that would > suffice for a research project. I was pleased on the last day of the > exhibition that the two anthropologists Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura > did a project that looked at the accumulated information. I think that they > were slightly awestruck by the sheer bulk of information and work that could > be hosted within the project. It is like the number of possibilities of > arranging 57 artworks that Maki from √•.b.√§.k.e. had calculated ‚Äì > 144,115,188,075,856,000. Considering that our solar system is roughly > 2,400,000,000,000,000 minutes old the number of possibilities is quite mind- > boggling. ‚Äù Critique At the time of the realization of the project there was some rather loud critique towards the project.p. 157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfilment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010 It was suggestedPaul O'Neill, The Culture of Curating and the Curating of Culture(s), 2012, p. 112-14, The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts 02142, that it offered a very traditional approach to the idea of how an exhibition might be made. In an interview with Barnaby Drabble the artist says.Per H√ºttner, Per H√ºttner and Gavin Wade interviewed by Barnaby Drabble , Marianne Eigenheer (Hg.) Curating Critique, ICE Reader 1, 2008, ]: > \\"I do agree, when you are faced with the possibility of just selecting > existing art work that is a very traditional take on what a curator is. But > then again, I think that I Am A Curator tried to do something that goes > beyond that. By using a very traditional approach it enabled us to do > something that was extremely creative and which opened new ideas about how > to put together exhibitions. In terms of selecting the works, It wasn't as > if they had only five pieces to choose from. To consider the work of fifty- > seven artists in one afternoon is a major task. Also, a lot of the work was > not finished, it was up to the curator of the day to complete it, a lot was > interactive, and a lot had different elements that needed to be put > together. So there were many different approaches on offer, reflecting the > working methods of the original selectors.\\" Another criticism of the project was that the individual artwork never got the attention it deserved.\\"Le curating est le reponse...\\", Paul O'Neill, 02#35, p.14-16, 2005, Nantes, France Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew writes: > \\"Even the 57 official ‚Äòartworks,‚Äô depending on their treatment by the > Curator of the Day, sometimes barely managed to retain their ‚Äúartwork‚Äù > status. There were times when they did slip into being things in cupboards > or things on the wall. That slippage between artworks and objects, or > between people‚Äôs roles in the process, is something I see as having been > central to the project, so I don‚Äôt know if I necessarily see the need for a > posthumous proliferation of the term ‚Äúartwork.‚Äù It feels like laminating a > piece of paper you are still making notes on. In the context of this project > a wipe-clean definition seems to jar.\\" In a review for C: International Contemporary Art Magazine, Fergal Stapleton described the exhibition as \\"a game, mutative and feudal, with several tiers of collusion\\" and \\"a bid for curatorial practice as art, and for curatorial supremacy over its subject arts disciplines.\\" In his PhD thesis Barnaby Drabble uses I am a Curator as one of three case studies. He quotes Stapleton and builds a severe critique to the project which he perceives as being elitist and self-promotional under the guise of being democratic.p. 155-157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfillment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010 On a more positive note British sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett suggests that projects like I am a Curator expands art into being a visual sociology;David Gauntlett, \\"Creative Explorations New Approaches to Identities and Audiences\\", p. 119-20. Routledge, London, 2007 > \\"We should note that, in some cases, the work of socially engaged visual > artists and the work of visual sociologists can look very similar. Many > artists have used art to explore identity, memory and the construction of > selfhood [...]. Other contemporary artists have engaged in a more externally > oriented art practice which involves ‚Äòordinary‚Äô people in the making of > work. Just as visual sociology sometimes blurs into something like art, in > these projects, art expands into being a kind of visual sociology. There are > many instances of such projects; here I will give just a few examples. A > project by the artist Per H√ºttner, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, entitled I > Am a Curator, gave 30 individuals or groups the opportunity to be ‚ÄòCurator > of the Day‚Äô, over a period of six weeks (5 November‚Äì14 December 2003). Each > day a new exhibition was assembled, using work by 57 artists that was made > available in the gallery.\\" It is clear that, I am a Curator offered novel ways for the audience to interact with artwork and the idea of an exhibition. They were forced to deal with art in a more intimate way than in a traditional exhibition. This means that the art on display might have been visible to a smaller audience than in a normal situation and yet at the same time the intimacy, reflection and constant change of context that the work was perceived in, meant that the audience was offered the possibility to understand the complexities and contradictions of artwork on a more profound level. This experimental approach to authorship and authenticity offers opportunity for creative interpretations. This openness in its turn has led to that I am a Curator has been appropriated by various participants of the project as being 'their own' in publications and academic texts.Jes Fernie, Two Minds: Artists And Architects in Collaboration, p. 136-142, Black Dog Publishing, 2006 Ten Year Anniversary For the 10 year anniversary of I am a Curator David Roberts Art Foundation in London invited Per Huttner to reflect on the project.Vision Forum website In the press release it is stated that \\"The project also provoked profound questions about artistic identity and its relationship to collectivity. Both shifts, in turn, lead to changed perspectives on the relationship between artworks, exhibitions, curators and artists. In short, IAAC opened a floodgate of problematics that overwhelmed the team working with the project. It is therefore important to revisit these questions after 10 years have passed, and to see how they have influenced individual artistic processes and how they can guide us into meaningful future reflections on related issues.\\"Press release on The David Roberts Art Foundation website / Per H√ºttner was joined by artist/architect C√©line Condorelli, neuroscientist Stephen Whitmarsh and Anette and Alberto Giacometti Foundation Director V√©ronique Wiesinger.

The writer and producer was Anatole de Grunwald, born in Russia in 1910, who fled to Britain with his parents in 1917. He had a long career there as a writer and producer, including the films The Way to the Stars, The Winslow Boy, Doctor's Dilemma, Libel, and The Yellow Rolls Royce.Innocents in Paris - BFI Plot The film is a romantic comedy about a group of Britons flying out from The London Airport for a weekend in Paris in 1953 in a British European Airways Airspeed Ambassador. An English diplomat (Sim) is on a working trip to obtain an agreement with his Russian counterpart (Illing); a Royal Marine bandsman (Shiner) has a night out on the tiles after winning a pool of the French currency held by all the Marines in his band; a young woman (Bloom) finds romance with an older Frenchman (Dauphin) who gives her a tour of Paris; an amateur artist (Rutherford) searches out fellow painters on the Left Bank and in the Louvre; a hearty Englishman (Edwards) spends the entire weekend in an English-style pub; and a Battle of Normandy veteran (Copeland) is an archetypal Scotsman in kilt and Tam o' Shanter who finds love with a young French woman (G√©rard). The film displays the mores and manners of the British, and, to a lesser extent, the French, in the early nineteen-fifties. At this time, Britons were allowed to take only ¬£25 out of the country, as ¬£5 British cash and traveller's cheques, and there are several scenes showing how the travellers dealt with this. The film also features a Russian nightclub (of which there were several in Paris at the time), with Ludmila Lopato, a Russian tzigane chanteuse, singing the original Russian version of the song that became \\"Those were the Days\\", which became a hit record for Mary Hopkin.

The current rector is the Rev. Jeanne Leinbach, installed on October 23, 2015. She is the first female rector of St. Paul's. Her predecessor was the Rev. Alan M. Gates, who served from 2004‚Äì2014, before his election as Bishop of Massachusetts. St. Paul's is a leading church and has the largest congregation in the Episcopal Diocese of Ohio. The church building is a Cleveland Heights landmark.Cleveland Heights landmarks Located at 2747 Fairmount Blvd, it is a contributing property in the Fairmount Boulevard District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. St. Paul's was first established in the city of Cleveland, Ohio on October 26, 1846. The congregation did not have its own building until 1851, as a frame building completed in 1849 burned completely. A small brick church in the Gothic Revival style was completed for the parish at Euclid and Sheriff (East 4th) Streets by 1858. St. Paul's congregation outgrew the church, however, as well as a subsequent building at East 40th Street (later sold to the Roman Catholic Church, and renamed the Church of the Conversion of St. Paul the Apostle in 1930). The first service at St. Paul's, Cleveland Heights, was on April 25, 1928. The church was designed by J. Byers Hayes of Walker & Weeks in the English Gothic style. The present nave was dedicated in 1951. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke there in May 1963 (months before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom). The early music instrument ensemble Apollo's Fire recorded their 2018 album Songs of Orpheus at St. Paul's. The album won the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo. Organs The current nave houses three pipe organs. The most notable of these three organs is a 1952 instrument built by local builder Walter Holtkamp. In the late 1980s, the church installed an instrument by the Austrian builder Gerhard Hradetzky. Hradetky's instrument is installed in the rear gallery of the sanctuary. The final, and most recent organ the church has taken possession of is an organ positive by Vladimir Slajch. The current organist and choirmaster of St. Paul's is Karel Paukert. The Holtkamp organ is considered the \\"definitive\\" example for its builder.An Encyclopedia of Organ ReferencesExternal links * St. Paul's Church website Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Cleveland Heights, Ohio Category:Episcopal churches in Ohio Category:Religious organizations established in 1846 Category:Churches in Cuyahoga County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cuyahoga County, Ohio Category:Historic district contributing properties in Ohio Category:1846 establishments in Ohio ","title":"St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Cleveland Heights, Ohio)"},{"id":"21760639","text":"The Cinder Path is a 1972 novel by Catherine Cookson. In 1994 it was adapted into a film directed by Simon Langton. Plot introduction In the English countryside of the early 20th century, the working-class protagonist must deal with a cruel and tyrannical father and later with a romantic tangle and a problematic marriage. He must keep, as well, a dark secret which must stay hidden at all costs. Later, he is taken into the British Army fighting on the Western Front of the First World War, where the shadows of his past pursue him and lead to a climax. Plot summary Charlie MacFell is the sixteen-year-old son of Edward MacFell, a cruel farm owner who punishes the farm's children by flogging them on a cinder path, causing their hands and knees to be grazed. Among MacFell's main targets is Ginger Slater, a workhouse boy who he whips for stealing a book to try and learn to read. Both MacFell and his neighbour, gentleman farmer Hal Chapman, have plans to marry Charlie to Chapman's elder daughter Victoria in the hope of one day uniting both their farms. MacFell has been bedding big Polly Benton, the wife of a crippled former labourer, as payment for her family keeping their cottage and plans to use her teenage daughter, young Polly, to \\"experience\\" Charlie. Although attracted to her, Charlie intends to refuse. Polly's brother Arthur misunderstands, thinking MacFell plans to bed Polly himself, and tries to prevent it by setting up a rope that causes MacFell to fall from his horse, accidentally killing him. Charlie covers the matter up, making it look as though the fall was an accident. He inherits the farm and, in order to prevent his mother evicting the Bentons in revenge for MacFell's infidelity, takes over managing it himself. Slater, the only other witness to MacFell's death, uses the knowledge to put pressure on Charlie and Arthur and ultimately blackmails Polly into marrying him. When Charlie is nineteen, Victoria's younger sister Nellie gets him drunk and convinces him to propose to her. He withdraws it on sobering up however and instead agrees to marry Victoria. The marriage soon falls apart; Victoria leaves the farm on inheriting a house in London and takes a lover, spreading stories that Charlie is impotent and their marriage was never consummated. Nellie also inherits a house in Gateshead and, with his mother's death, Charlie is left alone at the farm with his sister Betty. When conscription begins into the First World War, the now twenty-four-year-old Charlie decides against declaring himself exempt and finds himself at a training camp with Slater as his sergeant, who takes delight in humiliating him. Charlie learns Victoria's lover is his company commander Major Smith, but before he can file for divorce, he is recommended for a commission. On learning Nellie has tried to commit suicide because he ignored her, he realises he loves her. Soon after, he is deployed to France. Shortly before leaving, he learns Arthur, who volunteered early, has lost both his legs and an arm. During a push, Charlie ends up in charge of a small group of men including Slater. When his old enemy taunts him for buying a commission with his wife's whoredom, Charlie shoots him dead in a rage, but since Slater's rifle was moving towards him at the time, it is ruled self-defence, Slater's family are told he died bravely in battle and Charlie is commended for getting the rest of the men back safely. Towards the end of the war, Charlie suffers shrapnel injuries which leaves a large chunk lodged close to his heart: If it moves away from it, in can be removed, but it could move into it and kill him. Charlie makes plans to divorce Victoria and marry Nellie, but Betty, seeing herself as being pushed aside after years of running the farm, tricks him into giving her permission to sell the farm's furniture and livestock and flees with the money. Nellie promises to sell her house to help rebuild and she and Charlie consummate their relationship, causing the shrapnel to move away from his heart and leaving him hopeful for the future. Television adaptation In 1994, the novel was adapted into a three-part mini-series as part of ITV's series of adaptations of Catherine Cookson's novels. The adaptation starred Lloyd Owen as Charlie, Catherine Zeta-Jones as Victoria, Maria Miles as Nellie and Polly Adams as the girls' mother Florence. It was largely faithful to the source material, only removing a few minor characters and situations such as Charlie's encounter with a scrap merchant who gave him a lift, and adding extra scenes between Charlie and Nellie during their relationship (such as a last minute farewell at the train station before he is deployed) and a final confrontation between Charlie and Victoria, who is absent from the last third of the novel.

Background Following the Fourth Crusade, Baldwin IX of Flanders was elected emperor of the Latin Empire and was recognized to have not only a portion of Constantinople (the remainder was given to the Venetians), but also the north-west region of Asia Minor,. although recognition of sovereignty did not mean actual control of the territory. It was up to the emperor to exercise that control, by force of arms if necessary. Following the Fourth Crusade, Baldwin was occupied with events in Thrace and was later taken prisoner by the Bulgarians in the Battle of Adrianople in April 1205.. Asia Minor was ignored by the Latins for the time being, thus giving a breathing space for Theodore Lascaris, who had declared himself emperor and was based at Nicaea, to consolidate his power and focus his attention on the Sultanate of R√ªm during this time. Baldwin's brother, Henry, took over the Latin Empire and started operations against the Nicaean Empire at the end of 1206, but these were only minor engagements until Henry focused his attention in 1211.. On October 15 of that year, Henry won a major victory at the Rhyndacus River and pushed forward onto Pergamum and Nymphaeum, but guerrilla warfare on Theodore's part limited Henry's further advances. Due to both sides being exhausted, the Treaty of Nymphaeum was signed between the two emperors, halting the Latin advance into Asia Minor. The Latin holdings were confined to the north-western part of Anatolia, comprising the coasts of Bithynia and most of Mysia. Aftermath Although both sides would continue to fight for years to come, there were some important consequences of this peace agreement. First, the peace treaty effectively recognized both parties, as neither one was strong enough to destroy the other. The second consequence of the treaty was that David Komnenos, who had been a vassal of Henry and who had been carrying out his own war against Nicaea with the support of the Latin Empire, now effectively lost that support. Theodore was thus able to annex all of David's lands west of Sinope in late 1214, gaining access to the Black Sea. The third consequence was that Theodore was now free to wage war against the Seljuqs without the distraction of the Latins for the time being. Nicaea was able to consolidate their eastern frontier for the remainder of the century. Hostilities broke out again in 1224, and a crushing Nicaean victory at the Second Battle of Poemanenum reduced Latin territories in Asia effectively only to the Nicomedian peninsula. This treaty allowed the Nicaeans to go on the offensive in Europe years later, culminating in the reconquest of Constantinople in 1261..

HistoryEarly years (2006‚Äì2008)= Japandroids was formed in 2006 by Brian King (guitar, vocals) and David Prowse (drums, vocals). The two met in 2000 while attending the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia, and upon discovering a mutual interest in music, began attending live shows together regularly in Victoria and Vancouver. In 2003, Prowse moved to Vancouver, transferring to Simon Fraser University. Eager to form their own band, King agreed to relocate to Vancouver following his graduation, doing so in 2005. Heavily influenced by the raw and energetic recordings of The Sonics, King and Prowse began writing and recording music in 2006, hoping to emulate the same style. While they originally intended to find a third member to act as lead vocalist, they later decided to forego having a specific lead singer and simply share vocal duties.Usinger, Mike \\"Vancouver's Own Japandroids Make Good\\", The Georgia Straight, May 14, 2009 accessed November 10, 2010. The name Japandroids came from two other band name ideas: Japanese Scream (from Prowse) and Pleasure Droids (from King). Occasionally they would spell it without vowels, as JPNDRDS. Frustrated by the lack of support for live music in Vancouver, as well as the difficulty of 'breaking into' the local music scene, King and Prowse regularly set up their own shows. Inspired by the do-it-yourself methods of bands like Fugazi, they would often arrange for a venue or space to play, rent equipment, design and distribute flyers and posters, as well as arrange for their friends to help run the shows.Berman, Stuart \\"Interview: Japandroids\\", Eye Weekly, March 9, 2009 accessed November 10, 2010. Japandroids performed their first live show on December 30, 2006. Over the next two years, they would perform regularly in Vancouver, but managed only short, sporadic tours due to conflicts with King's geology studies. During this period, Japandroids self-released two EPs, 2007's All Lies,Worth, Liz \\"EP Review: All Lies\\" , Exclaim!, December 2007 accessed November 10, 2010. and 2008's Lullaby Death Jams.Worth, Liz \\"EP Review: Lullaby Death Jams\\", Exclaim!, May 2008 accessed November 10, 2010. Each EP was limited to 500 copies, and would later be re-released as a compilation titled No Singles. Japandroids recorded their first full-length album, Post-Nothing in the summer of 2008, with the intention of self-releasing it in 2009. However, by the fall of 2008, King and Prowse had become convinced that the band was going nowhere, and mutually decided to call it quits at the end of the year. It was agreed that their appearances at Pop Montreal in Montreal and CMJ Music Marathon in New York City would be their final live performances. It was also agreed that they would self-release the album early in 2009, but would not promote it. By December 2008, King was already attempting to assemble a new band. =Post- Nothing (2009‚Äì2010)= In January 2009, Japandroids signed to independent Canadian label Unfamiliar Records, who were eager to release the album, despite the band's reservations about continuing. Frustrated by label interest only after they had decided to break-up, King and Prowse reluctantly agreed to continue Japandroids temporarily, and began performing live again. In March 2009, taste-making website Pitchfork awarded the song \\"Young Hearts Spark Fire\\" a 'Best New Track' designation, instantly exposing the band to a large audience outside of Canada.Hogan, Marc \\"Single Review: Young Hearts Spark Fire\\", Pitchfork Media, March 4, 2009 accessed November 10, 2010.

The Post- Nothing Tour consisted of 9 individual legs, and included over 200 shows in more than 20 countries. While primarily headlining their own shows, Japandroids also toured supporting acts such as A Place To Bury Strangers and Health in Europe, and The Walkmen in North America. The Post-Nothing Tour was originally scheduled to begin on April 23, 2009 in Calgary, Alberta. After performing one show, Japandroids were forced to postpone and reschedule the remainder of their first full-scale North American tour due to a health emergency. On the morning of April 24, 2009, King was checked into Calgary's Foothills Medical Center to undergo emergency surgery for a life-threatening perforated ulcer. Touring resumed June 13, 2009 after King's recovery with a performance at Vancouver's Music Waste festival, and continued uninterrupted through to the final show October 27, 2010 at Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey. Among the dates of the tour were numerous festival appearances in North America and Europe, including Pitchfork Music Festival, Sasquatch!, Bonnaroo, Osheaga Festival, Roskilde Festival, and Primavera Sound. Initially, the duo desired to include several more tracks on the album, but were unable due to insufficient funds.Tedder, Michael \\"Q&A;: Japandroids' Brian King\\" , The Village Voice, October 26, 2010 accessed November 10, 2010.

These tracks include \\"Art Czars\\", \\"Younger Us\\", and \\"Heavenward Grand Prix\\". The same year, Japandroids re-released their first two EPs as a compilation titled No Singles.

Structure  MMP-27 was discovered and cloned in 1998 by Yang and Kurkinen. Initially compared to the so-called Chicken MMP (CMMP), MMP-27 actually shows very little sequence homology with this protease. Sequence homology predicts that the human MMP-27 gene encodes the canonical domains shared by most MMPs (annotation based on Uniprot entry Q9H306): (i) a signal peptide (residues 1-17), (ii) a propeptide (18-98) containing the cysteine switch motif (89-96), (iii) a catalytic domain (99-263) containing the typical HEXXHXXGXXH motif of the metzincins (M10 and M12 families of the MEROPS[2] database), (iv) a proline-rich hinge region (264-278) and (v) a hemopexin-like domain (279-465) folded as a four-bladed Œ≤-propeller through disulfide bond formation between the two flanking Cys residues (Cys279 and Cys465). MMP-27 could be classified in the stromelysin group of MMPs, since MMP-27 shows 51,6% homology with stromelysin-2 (MMP-10) and localizes in the cluster of MMPs located on chromosome 11. Like the six known MT-MMPs, human MMP-27 is prolonged by an additional C-terminal domain (466-513). The Spoctopus algorithm for topological prediction suggests that this C-terminal extension (CTE) includes a potential transmembrane domain (490-510). However, this sequence is less hydrophobic than in transmembrane MT-MMPs (MMP-14, -15, -16 and -24) as it contains hydrophilic/charged residues, in particular His492, Lys493, His504 and Lys507.  Function  Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. Cominelli A. and colleagues demonstrated that MMP-27 is an unusual protease which is not secreted and is efficiently retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in three mammalian cell lines. Deletion mutants and swapping with recombinant MMP-10 demonstrate that the unique MMP-27 C-terminal extension (CTE) is necessary and sufficient for endoplasmic reticulum retention but does not provide a stable membrane anchorage. Despite sequence homology with MT-MMPs, the CTE is not a transmembrane domain and does not interact permanently with membrane. This unique feature for an MMP raises important questions about potential functions of MMP-27, which remains to be investigated.  Clinical significance  Sparse information about MMP-27 expression was found in studies of gene expression profiling (micro-array) or in expression pattern analysis of MMP family members during developmental, physiological or pathological processes. MMP-27 transcript is detected in almost every tissue, except the brain, with the highest expression found in the liver during mouse development In the adult, MMP-27 mRNA is mostly abundant in anti-IgG/IgM stimulated B lymphocytes, bone and kidney but is present at lower levels in the heart. A recent investigation of the transcriptome from distinct tissue compartments of the menstrual endometrium disclosed specific MMP-27 overexpression in areas of stromal breakdown. In another transcriptomic study, MMP-27 was found to be increased in the human endometrium at the end of the secretory phase, before menstruation. Moreover, MMP-27 expression is down-regulated in macrophages when co-cultured with ovarian cancer cells but up-regulated in cartilages from patients with osteoarthritis or in abdominal aortic aneurysms. MMP-27 was also identified, at the protein level, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and in primary human breast cancer. Recently, MMP-27 has been demonstrated to be expressed by CD163+/CD206+ macrophages in the human endometrium and in superficial endometriotic lesions.

However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; members of this subfamily can be anchored to the extracellular membrane by either a transmembrane domain or glycophosphatidylinositol linkage, suggesting that these proteins are expressed at the cell surface rather than secreted in a soluble form.

According to Oscar Lewenstein (later co-founder of the English Stage Company), \\"Jean [Shepeard] was reluctant to let us have the rights, but eventually I was able to make a deal with her.

For this run, Freda Jackson, star of the yet to be released film, was added to the cast. Noted The Stage newspaper, \\"Jack Hylton feels this play has a vast potential audience who will welcome the cheaper seats obtainable at the Victoria Palace. There is no question of the play, which deals with the social problem of the unmarried mother, being sensationalised by its transference to a twice-nightly theatre.\\"'Chit Chat', The Stage, 5 June 1952 By this time, Hylton and Hawtrey had already taken the play on an ill-fated excursion to New York, where it opened at the Plymouth Theatre on 3 March, was deemed \\"repulsive\\"'British Play Repulsive', Coventry Evening Telegraph, 4 March 1952 by local critics and closed on 8 March after only eight performances. This production marked the only Broadway appearance for such British actresses as Betty Ann Davies, Miriam Karlin, Gwen Watford and June Whitfield. In the UK, the play began a long life on tour even while the Vaudeville production was still running. It was also popular at regional repertory theatres. Freda Jackson, for example, spent much of 1954 guest- starring in the play at various reps, notably Windsor, Richmond and Northampton. Then in 1955, director Rona Laurie and producer Jean Shepeard reclaimed the property for a tour of provincial music halls; Shepeard also acted in this version. Sylvia Rayman, meanwhile, had two further plays produced, both of them thrillers - Time to Speak and Justice in Heaven, first staged in April 1957 and March 1958 respectively. Neither repeated the success of Women of Twilight. The first notable revival of Women of Twilight was directed by Jonathan Rigby and opened at London's White Bear Theatre on 3 October 2013 as part of its Lost Classics Project. The production was itself revived, at the same venue, on 6 January 2014 and again, this time at Pleasance Islington, from 14 April.http://womenoftwilightplay.co.uk/home/4580216438 =Theatre reviews= The Stage, October 1951: \\"It is seldom that a play comes along that can grip like this one does. Perhaps it is just as well. The plight of dramatic critics whose emotions were weekly wrung with this sort of thing would be sad indeed. For here is a direct and sincere composition that, without possessing much artistic merit or beauty of line, tells, nevertheless, a story that grips the imagination from the outset and will not let it go. It does not demand much prescience to predict that it will duly gain a larger audience than it will see at Swiss Cottage ... Miss Rayman has etched a clear-cut and disturbing play in which the characters are extraordinarily well defined and endowed with a credibility that carries them unscathed through situations that verge at times perilously close to the melodramatic.\\"unsigned review, The Stage, 18 October 1951 The Observer, October 1951: \\"No one would put this among the Plays Pleasant, but it does seize the mind.\\"J C Trewin in The Observer, 21 October 1951 The Spectator, October 1951: \\"Miss Rayman has written her first play around a revolting character who makes a comfortable income by taking unmarried mothers and their infants into her Hampstead home ... Virtue triumphs on the Embassy stage but it does not always triumph outside the theatre, and one is left wondering just what does happen to such girls who have neither friends nor relatives to turn to and who escape the welfare of the State for some reason. The piece is very well acted by Barbara Couper, Vida Hope, Rene Ray and the rest of a company entirely of women.\\"Iain Hamilton in The Spectator, 18 October 1951 Daily Telegraph, October 1951: \\"Unrelieved femininity is popularly supposed to breed neurosis, and certainly this is the most hysterical play I have met for many years.\\"unsigned review, The Daily Telegraph, 16 October 1951 The Stage, November 1951: \\"The play well deserves its quick transfer to the West End ... Sylvia Rayman, whose first play this is and whose previous career has run on non-theatrical lines, piles on the agony more than somewhat. This is indeed a remarkable drama to come from an inexperienced pen; it would be praised if offered by an established dramatist ... Barbara Couper, as the baby-farmer and operator of the home, could not send a bigger thrill down our spines if she were appearing in the most horrible of avowed Grand Guignol sketches; and Rene Ray really moves us as poor Vivianne.

But the characterisation was entirely convincing, so that, thanks to an exceedingly clever all-woman cast, one quickly lost one's sense that the story was over- coloured ... Improbable though it may seem, there is a considerable amount of humour in the play, thanks to the author's undoubted gift for character drawing, and Anthony Hawtrey's production made the most of every opportunity for light and shade. Mary Purvis's setting was painfully squalid in every detail.\\"Frances Stephens in Theatre World, January 1952 The Stage, June 1952: \\"Twice-nightly performance at a theatre so long associated with the antics of the Crazy Gang is hardly the ideal environment for a bold play about unmarried mothers ... One fears not so much for the play, which, leaving aside the worth of its subject, is no more than a tolerably good one; but rather for the subject itself, which is liable to be taken in the wrong spirit by the prude and prurient ... Anthony Hawtrey's production has made the transfer from the Vaudeville without any obvious hitches ...

In addition, the enigmatic character of Laura became a continental boarder called Lilli.

The film, which infers that it has performed a social duty in bringing these unpleasant facts before the public, could have done better by dropping the pointless initial Soho nightclub scenes, and introducing a sequence showing what social services there are available for the unmarried mother. But Women of Twilight, the first British film to receive an 'X' certificate from the censor, is perhaps scarcely remarkable for truth to life.\\"unsigned review, Monthly Film Bulletin, December 1952 Sunday Dispatch, January 1953: \\"A study of low life and bad morals in the Russian manner. A houseful of unhappy unmarried mothers will arouse the sympathy of all but the most censorious. Many of the original stage cast repeat their lifelike performances on the screen. If the aim of tragedy is to purge the soul with pity, this is indeed a great tragic film.\\"Harris Deans in The Sunday Dispatch, 18 January 1953 Daily Telegraph, January 1953: \\"I missed Women of Twilight as a play because I chose to; I saw the film because I must. This study of the conditions in which unmarried mothers live and have their children, and not uncommonly watch them die, is powerful, sordid, disturbing and perhaps not so overdrawn as some good easy people think.

But if you enjoy watching women snarling, scratching or pulling each other's hair out, in sordid surroundings, this is your picture.\\"Roy Nash in The Star, 16 January 1953 Daily Sketch, January 1953: \\"Here is an adult, honest drama which focuses attention on a real-life problem to which none of us should close our eyes.

Her wickedness seeps through her mask of virtue like dampness through a newly painted wall; her every sweetness is threaded with a shiver ...

It was reopened as the 710 Main Theatre in 2012 and is managed by Shea's Performing Arts Center. History Founded in the 1920s in Buffalo by a group of local enthusiasts, the Studio Theatre evolved as both a theatre and a theatre school into Western New York's only professional regional theatre. In 1927, Jane Keeler, a teacher of speech and drama, and Lars Potter, President of the Buffalo Players, and others established the Studio Theatre School. Performances and classes were located in a second floor lodge meeting hall on the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Anderson Place.Buffalo Courier-Express Magazine, September 22, 1974. In 1934, Studio Theatre moved to a concert hall on the second floor of the Teck Theatre, until that building was converted to a movie house three years later. Studio Theatre School was incorporated with the playhouse as an educational institution in 1936 under the New York State Board of Regents. In 1937, having purchased the former Universalist Church at 305 Lafayette, the Studio Theatre was at home there for many years. In the early 1960s, the resident theatre movement was beginning, and Studio Theatre began its evolution into a professional Equity theatre under the leadership of Neal Du Brock. In a mere forty-day transformation, the former Town Casino (an important local nightclub) at 681 Main Street was transformed into the Buffalo's only not-for- profit professional regional theatre and was renamed Studio Arena Theatre in 1965. Studio Arena Theatre was a key player in the resident theater movement.http://artvoice.com/issues/v5n13/blossom_cohan Eventually it moved across the street into the former Palace Burlesque Theater at 710 Main Street in 1978 and became the cornerstone of the Buffalo Theatre District. Until its demise as The Studio Arena Theatre it had claim to being one of the oldest resident theaters in the United States. It was particularly supported over the years by Wells V. Moot. Over the years it has produced many notable plays and world premieres including work by Edward Albee, A. R. Gurney, and Lanford Wilson.

He is currently employed as Entertainment Editor at the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) news agency. He took up his present position after a short stint as a Deputy Editor in First Post WeeklyVinayak Chakravorty, Firstpost, retrieved 26 February 2019 of the Network 18 media conglomerate. Chakravorty was in charge of the cinema and popular arts section during this tenure. His position at Firstpost was preceded by a decade's association with Mail Today newspaper, when he headed the Entertainment section of the daily. He also reviewed films, apart from writing opinion pieces. His articles, reviews, exclusive interviews and op-eds are regularly featured on the websites of Daily Mail, UK, India Today and dailyo.in, the opinion website of India Today group. Chakravorty made his mark as the film critic of Delhi's leading newspaper, the Hindustan Times, between 2001 and 2006. As a film expert, Chakravorty is invited as guest speaker on cinema by various television channels. He is also occasionally quoted on subjects related to cinema by magazines including Time Magazine, which has called him a \\"well-known film critic\\".Time.com retrieved 20 December 2010 In 2012, 2015 and 2016 he has been a member of the Preview Selection Committee that finalises films for the World Cinema and Panorama sections of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), held every year in Goa, India.  Early years  Chakravorty was born in Ranchi, a town formerly in the east Indian state of Bihar and now the capital of the subsequently formed state of Jharkhand. He hails from a middle-class Bengali family, the only child of an engineer father and a school teacher mother. He studied at St. Xavier's School, Doranda, Ranchi. He further pursued BA(Hons) - English from St. Xavier's College, Ranchi. He discovered his passion for journalism in high school, when he was inducted into the board of editors of his school magazine, Endeavour. After graduation, Chakravorty moved to Kolkata for a few years, where he studied journalism at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and topped the post- graduate diploma course at the institution. Career Chakravorty admits being torn between the options of pursuing higher studies leading to a career in academics and choosing journalism as his calling. One reason is, despite performing well in journalism school, he enrolled in Kolkata's prestigious Jadavpur University for a Masters course in Comparative Literature. However, a month into his MA course, he received an offer from Kolkata's leading English daily, The Telegraph. Chakravorty quit his MA course to join The Telegraph as a trainee journalist in October 1995. He started off as a newsdesk sub editor, a job that allowed him to understand the nuances of news sense and newspaper dynamics first hand. During this stint, he also started making his mark as a feature writer, contributing to the op-ed and features pages of the newspaper. In 1997, he left Kolkata to join The Pioneer newspaper in New Delhi, as a senior feature writer in the daily's Sunday section. A year later, thanks to his passion and knowledge of mainstream and offbeat cinema, Chakravorty was given the chance to review films for the newspaper. Between 1999 and 2001, Chakravorty briefly romanced the emerging medium of the times, the internet. He joined digitalHT.com, the website hosted by Hindustan Times that was subsequently rechristened as go4i.com. During this phase, he anchored the cinema channel of the website in the capacity of Senior Content Writer, cinema channel. All along, he continued to make his mark as a film critic. Chakravorty joined Hindustan Times in January 2001 as film critic and feature journalist for a fruitful association of over six years that he ended in July 2007 to join Mail Today, the newspaper launched by the prestigious India Today Group in association with The Daily Mail, UK the same year.  Style of critique  Chakravorty's film reviews are noted for their precision of opinion and lucid style, combined with bursts of wry humour. In various blogs and websites, Chakravorty has been described as a proponent of the school of film critics who approach cinema solely from the entertainment point of view, rather than aesthetic details or the finer language of cinema. Chakravorty defends this, saying that, as a film critic in India, 99 per cent of the films he has to watch in the line of duty ‚Äî foreign or Indian ‚Äî are purely commercial ventures solely aimed at earning big money by providing entertainment. In this context, he is considered among the select film critics in India whose ratings rarely go wrong. However he believes that every film must be reviewed keeping its target audience in mind, which itself does not always translate to box-office success. A critic's star ratings, he adds, should be appreciated and understood in the overall context of his review of a particular film. As a film critic, Chakravorty cites the iconic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times as his idol and a major influence.  Personal choices  Chakravorty's knowledge of world cinema is reflected in his reviews. He labels \\"just about everything that can be projected on a screen\\" as cinematic work that might draw his interest, pointing out that good cinema is not genre- specific. He counts Charles Chaplin, Satyajit Ray, Woody Allen, Steven Spielberg, Krzysztof Kieslowski and the Coen Brothers among favourite filmmakers, besides world cinema by contemporary masters including Lars von Trier, Michael Haneke, Pedro Almodovar, Peter Greenaway and Gaspar No√©. A supporter of the new-age crossover cinema movement in India, Chakravorty welcomes the advent of new-generation Indian filmmakers such as Anurag Kashyap and Dibakar Banerjee.

The community is most well known for being named after its most prominent resident No√´l Doiron and for ship building in the nineteenth century. Noel Doiron is the namesake of the village as well as the surrounding communities of Noel Shore, Nova Scotia, East Noel (also known as Densmore Mills, Nova Scotia), Noel Road, Nova Scotia, North Noel Road, Nova Scotia. The earliest recorded reference to the community of \\"Noel\\" was by surveyor Charles Morris in 1752.

During that time Noel Doiron and others in the Noel Bay built a chapel at Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia, eight dwellings and dykes that are still there to this day. During this time, the village of Noel was in the middle of a war zone between New England and New France fighting to maintain control over Acadia. Upon his return from the New France victory in the Battle of Grand Pr√© (1747), military officer Daniel Li√©nard de Beaujeu stopped into Noel to tend to his wounded soldiers. Li√©nard de Beaujeu is the first recorded visitor to the village. First recorded visitor to Vil Noel (1747): Daniel Li√©nard de Beaujeu At the beginning of Father Le Loutre's War, Noel Doiron and many others joined the Acadian Exodus from mainland Nova Scotia to the French colony of Ile St. Jean (i.e., Prince Edward Island).

However, after the British occupied Ile St Jean following the Siege of Lousibourg in 1758 they deported Noel Doiron and the former Noel residents in the Ile Saint-Jean Campaign of the Expulsion of the Acadians. Their deportation ship the Duke William sank on December 13, 1758 en route to France. At least three hundred and sixty Acadians, including Noel and most of his extended family, perished.Letter from Captain William Nichols dated December 16, 1758 says 360 passengers aboard the Duke William: London Magazine XXVII, p. 655. The sinking of the Duke William is one of the worst marine disasters in Canadian history (as measured by Canadian lives lost)‚Äîsee List of disasters in Canada by death toll. According to the Captain of the Duke William, William Nichols, Noel Doiron was \\"head prisoner\\" aboard the doomed vessel and was described as the \\"father of the whole island\\", a reference to Noel's place of prominence among the Acadian residents of Isle St. Jean (Prince Edward Island).Journal of William Nichols, \\"The Naval Chronicle\\", 1807 For his \\"noble resignation\\" and self-sacrifice aboard the Duke William, Noel was celebrated in popular print throughout the 19th century in England and America.The Publications included Frost,John, \\"The Book of Good Examples Drawn from History and Biography\\", New York: 1846, p. 65; \\"The Saturday Magazine\\" (1821), p. 502; and Percy, Reubens, \\"Percey's Anecdotes\\", New York (1843), p. 44.  Ulster Scots (Irish)  After the exodus of the Acadians from Noel (1750), the land was owned but never settled by Charles Morris. Twenty one years after Noel was vacated by the Acadians, the village was settled by Ulster Scots people Timothy O'Brien and his four sons (1771).  Shipbuilding  Osmond O'Brien Shipyard Monument, Noel, Nova Scotia The Noel Bay had many shipyards in the 19th century. The most prominent was the Osmond O'Brien Shipyard.

Noel Doiron and the East Hants Acadians. Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society: The Journal Prior to the publication of academic scholarship on the namesake of the village of Noel (2008), the origin of the community's name was virtually unknown. The reason for the name's unknown origin was, in part, because the oral history of the community was lost with the Deportation of the Acadians, which left the village vacated for 21 years. The Ulster Scots and their descendants who arrived in the village created folklore that claimed that the village was named \\"Noel\\" (the French word for Christmas) because either the Acadians or the Irish first arrived in the village on Christmas day. Such folklore informed The Chronicle Herald headline on December 14, 1965: \\"Village of Noel has Direct Association with Christmas\\". This folklore has also been reflected in a recent children‚Äôs book by Bruce Nunn and Yolanda Poplawska named Magical Christmas Light of Old Nova Scotia (2003). There is also a special Christmas postmark by Canada Post created for the community (2005). Other scholarship erroneously asserted that the community may have been named after Noel Pinet.

Along with Kenny McEntyre, he is regarded as one of the top defensive backs in Arena Football history. He spent ten of his seasons in the AFL with the SaberCats; over this span, he won four ArenaBowl championships and three Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) awards. In 2012, Thomas was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame. Early years Clevan Thomas was born on April 6, 1979, in Miami, Florida. He attended Miami High School, where he excelled as a football player (on both offense and defense); as a result of his stellar play, he was recruited by a number of the United States' top collegiate football programs (namely Clemson, Florida State, Florida, and Miami); he ultimately chose to play for the Florida State Seminoles (FSU). In 1997, as a freshman, Thomas saw immediate action (appearing in eight games); in 1998, as a sophomore, he appeared in all 13 of Florida State's games. In 1999, as a junior, Thomas emerged as a starter; he recorded 16 tackles and 3 interceptions for the Seminoles. Thomas also started the Sugar Bowl for Florida State, recording five tackles; his efforts helped the Seminoles defeat Virginia Tech, 46‚Äì29, to win a National Championship. The following year, the team again advanced to the National Championship Game; while Thomas was again a starter, Florida State lost to the Oklahoma Sooners by a score of 13‚Äì2. This game marked the end of Thomas' collegiate career. Professional careerFirst SaberCats stint (2002 to 2008)= Despite his accomplishments at Florida State, Thomas was not selected in the 2001 NFL Draft. As a result, he signed with the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League on December 18, 2001. In 2002, as a rookie, Thomas emerged as an instant superstar. He tallied 54 tackles (46 solo), 21 pass breakups, and six interceptions during the 14‚Äìgame regular season; additionally, he returned 59 kicks for 1,353 yards and six touchdowns as San Jose's primary kick returner. For his efforts, he was named the AFL Rookie of the Year (ROY) and AFL Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY). He was also honored as a First Team All-Arena selection. Thomas' efforts helped propel the SaberCats to a then-record 13‚Äì1 regular season finish. The SaberCats would then win two playoff games to reach ArenaBowl XVI; there, they crushed the rival Arizona Rattlers in a 52‚Äì14 rout to capture the first championship in franchise history. Thomas built upon his fantastic rookie campaign in 2003. That year, he recorded 37.5 tackles (34 solo), 20 pass breakups, and 13 interceptions (three of which were returned for touchdowns) despite playing in only 14 of the team's 16 regular season games; he also returned 61 kicks for 1,253 yards and four touchdowns. In light of this, Thomas was again named the AFL Defensive Player of the year; similarly, he was named a First Team All-Arena selection for the second consecutive year. Thomas' SaberCats again marched deep into the playoffs, but lost 62‚Äì49 to the Rattlers in the semi-finals. Thomas' AFL career slowed somewhat in the mid-2000s. In 2004, he missed all but three games on account of injuries; as such, he recorded only 18 tackles (14 solo) and 1 interception (which he returned for a touchdown). Despite this setback, Thomas collected his second championship (while on the injured reserve) when the SaberCats defeated the Rattlers in ArenaBowl XVIII. In 2005, Thomas returned to action; while he played well (recording 49.5 tackles, 10 pass breakups, and 5 interceptions in 13 games), he failed to replicate the dominance of his first two seasons. The defending champion SaberCats reached the playoffs once again in 2005 (despite a pedestrian 9‚Äì7 regular season record); they were quickly ousted by the eventual champion Colorado Crush, 56‚Äì48, in the first round. 2006 marked a return to form for Thomas. His 87 tackles (79 solo) shattered his previous high of 55 (46 solo); he also posted 10 pass breakups and 7 interceptions. Thomas' steady play proved crucial for the SaberCats, who blundered their way to a 3‚Äì6 record through nine games; they would go on to win their final seven regular season games (and a playoff game) before narrowly losing to the Chicago Rush in the Conference Championship game. Thomas' resurgent season netted him a Second Team All-Arena selection. In 2007, Thomas turned in arguably his most complete performance (to that point in his career). He contributed 78.5 tackles (69 solo), 20 pass breakups, and 9 interceptions (two of which were returned for touchdowns); his fantastic play helped the SaberCats to a 13‚Äì3 regular season finish. After missing the SaberCats' opening playoff game (a 76‚Äì67 victory over the Colorado Crush), Thomas made a triumphant return; in the American Conference Championship Game, against the Chicago Rush, he intercepted two errant Matt D'Orazio passes. The SaberCats' 61‚Äì49 victory, propelled them to ArenaBowl XXI, where they crushed the Columbus Destroyers by a score of 55-33; their victory gave Thomas his third AFL Championship in six years. For his efforts, he was named a First Team All- Arena selection; he lost the Defensive Player of the Year Award to defensive end Greg White. Thomas turned in a nearly identical performance in 2008 with 83 tackles (68 solo), 18 pass breakups, and nine interceptions (two of which were returned for touchdowns). He was rewarded with a Second Team All-Arena selection (his fifth career selection) at the end of the regular season. His dominance helped the SaberCats reach the playoffs for the ninth consecutive season; they ultimately advanced to ArenaBowl XXII, which they lost (59‚Äì56) to the Philadelphia Soul. The loss marked the end of Thomas' first stint with the SaberCats. =Hiatus (2009 to 2012)= Thomas' career was abruptly interrupted when the AFL, citing financial difficulties, abruptly folded. As a result, despite opportunities to play in other indoor football leagues (such as the AF2, Thomas sat out the entire 2009 season. In 2010, the league resumed operations, but the SaberCats did not. Prior to the start of the 2010 season, Thomas practiced with the Arizona Rattlers (who had resumed operations just prior), but did not join the team. The SaberCats resumed operations one year later in 2011, but Thomas remained inactive. By 2012, despite the lack of a formal announcement, it appeared that he had entered retirement; in light of this, he was elected to the Arena Football Hall of Fame. Thomas, despite spending only seven seasons in the AFL, had 50 career interceptions, tied for the second-highest total in AFL history. In 2012, the AFL released its 25 Greatest Players list; this list declared Thomas to have been the 24th greatest player in Arena Football League history. =Second SaberCats stint (2013 to 2015)= In 2013, Thomas abruptly rejoined the SaberCats. Given his lengthy absence, the move surprised many onlookers; additionally, questions remained about his potential effectiveness and durability. Thomas responded with the finest season of his career. In 2013, he tallied 74 tackles (65 solo), 25 pass breakups, and a career-high 15 interceptions (one shy of the league record) in 17 games. He returned an AFL-record 6 interceptions for touchdowns (the previous record was four). Five of the six interception returns came in the final four games of the regular season; put another way, Thomas recorded more interception returns in the final four games of the 2013 season than any AFL player had returned in an entire season. Thomas' incredible showing netted him a third Defensive Player of the Year Award (tying the mark set by Kenny McEntyre for the most in AFL history); he was also named a First Team All-Arena selection (his fourth career appearance on the First Team). Thomas' resurgence helped the SaberCats to a 13‚Äì5 finish; they lost to the defending champion Arizona Rattlers in the first round of the playoffs. Thomas returned to the SaberCats in 2014. While his numbers dropped considerably from his 2013 campaign, he remained one of the league's best cornerbacks; in 2014, Thomas tallied 70.5 tackles (60 solo), 14 pass breakups, and 8 interceptions (one of which was returned for a touchdown) in a career- high 18 games. Thomas remained a key part of the SaberCats' top-ranked defense; despite this, he failed to garner any major awards in 2014. The SaberCats once again finished 13‚Äì5; while they won their first-round playoff game, they were again defeated by the Rattlers (this time in the Conference Championship game). Thomas did not re-join the SaberCats at the start of the 2015 season, once again fueling speculation that he had retired. During the offseason, San Jose had acquired AFL superstar cornerback Virgil Gray; this served to bolster the belief that Thomas' career had reached its end. During a Week 3 contest against the Tampa Bay Storm, Gray suffered a season-ending knee injury; days later, the SaberCats announced Thomas' return to the team. Thomas continued to play well; in 15 games, he recorded 41 tackles (34 solo), 14 pass breakups, and 6 interceptions. In 2015, the SaberCats' defense was historically dominant (allowing just 36.8 points per game, the lowest such figure in modern AFL history); the SaberCats finished the regular season with 17‚Äì1 record (tied for the best in AFL history). Thomas' SaberCats won their first two playoff games to advance to ArenaBowl XXVIII, where they faced the Jacksonville Sharks. During the game, Thomas recovered a Michael Lindsay fumble deep in Jacksonville territory; the turnover resulted, shortly thereafter, in a key score for the SaberCats. San Jose would go on to win the game, 68‚Äì47, to claim the fourth championship in franchise history; it was also the fourth championship of Thomas' career. =Los Angeles Kiss= Thomas was assigned to the Los Angeles Kiss on March 31, 2016. =Baltimore Brigade= Thomas was assigned to the Baltimore Brigade on June 13, 2018. Legacy Clevan Thomas remains one of the most decorated defensive players in Arena Football history. His three Defensive Player of the Year selections ties him with Kenny McEntyre for the most all-time; the 11-year gap between his first and last DPOY selections is the longest in AFL history. His 81 career interceptions rank second in league history, behind McEntyre's 97. Thomas remains the only player to earn either DPOY or First-Team All Arena selections after being inducted into the Hall of Fame; similarly, he remains the only player to start (and win) an ArenaBowl after his induction. Thomas holds numerous San Jose SaberCats franchise records. He has been a part of all four of the SaberCats' ArenaBowl championship teams (XVI, XVIII, XXI, and XXVIII); he is the only person to have won all four as a player. He is the only player to have won four ArenaBowls with the same team in the 21st century. His son Clevan Thomas Jr. is currently a wide receiver for Kentucky Wildcats football team.

He was the third son of Thomas Dunne of Gatley Park and Bircher Hall, Herefordshire and his wife, Harriet (n√©e Russell). His maternal grandfather was General Sir Edward Lechmere Graves Russell of Ashford Hall, Ludlow, Shropshire. Following education at Wellington College, Berkshire and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he received a commission as an officer in the Border Regiment in 1884. He subsequently entered the Staff College, Camberley, passing out of the institution in 1891. In 1896 his father died, and he resigned his commission. In 1899 he married Grace Daphne Rendel, daughter of Lord Rendel, former Liberal MP for Montgomeryshire. On the outbreak of the Second Boer War in the same year, he volunteered to return to the army, becoming brigade major at Aldershot. Following the war the couple moved to Gatley Park, an estate adjoining Wigmore Castle. In 1905 Dunne unsuccessfully contested a by-election at Kingswinford for the Liberals. In the following year a general election was held, and he was elected to serve as member of parliament for Walsall. He was only an MP for one term: at the next general election in January 1910 he was defeated by his Conservative opponent. He was chosen as Liberal candidate for the Melton Division of Leicestershire at the next election in December, but was not elected. On the outbreak of the First World War, Dunne was appointed to the staff of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1915 he was transferred to Chester, as part of the headquarters staff of the Western Command. He spent the latter part of the war on secondment to the War Office. Following the war, he settled back into country life in Herefordshire, where he was appointed a deputy lieutenant on 15 January 1919. He was high sheriff of the county in 1922, and served as a county alderman on Herefordshire County Council, where he chaired the education committee. Dunne had two daughters and a son. The latter was Philip Russell Rendel Dunne, who sat as Conservative MP for Stalybridge and Hyde from 1935 to 1937. E M Dunne died in February 1944, aged 79.

This species is commonly found in tropical and sub-tropical regions where it grows as a soil saprotroph. Farming activities in the endemic zone are a risk factor for the development of chromoblastomycosis. Classification Fonsecaea is a genus of ascomycetous fungi affiliated with the family Herpotrichiellaceae. The genus comprises three sibling species, all with pathogenic potential: F. pedrosoi, F. monophora and F. nubica. Ecology and distribution Fonsecaea pedrosoi occurs in soil and on plants and trees where it grows as a saprotroph. It is found predominantly in tropical regions especially South- and Central America. All three recognized species of Fonsecaea exhibit geographically patterned genetic variation. The closely related species F. monophora and F. nubica are distributed worldwide and show the greater population-level genetic diversity than the geographically restricted F. pedrosoi. Environmental surveys have documented the recovery of F. pedrosoi on rotting wood of the Cambara tree, (Gochnatia polymorpha) from the Brazilian Corporation of Agricultural Research forest in Colombo, Paran√°, Brazil. It has been also isolated from living trees, stumps, woodpiles and fence posts in central Nigeria. Physiology Clinical isolates of grow consistently at temperatures up to . In contrast, environmental isolates of F. pedrosoi exhibit growth consistently up to 35 ¬∞C, and irregularly up to Physiological studies have shown the degradation of urea and tyrosine, and the lack of growth on the proteins gelatin, casein and the purines xanthine and hypoxanthine. Likewise, lipase activity was demonstrated, but phospholipase, collagenase and amylase were not expressed. Human disease Fonsecaea pedrosoi is one of several main causative agents of human chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection localized to skin and subcutaneous tissue. The disease was first described by Alexandrino Pedroso in 1911. The fungus infects the host through the traumatic implantation of sexual spores known as conidia or hyphal fragments. Once introduced in the subcutaneous tissues, the propagules germinate to establish an invasive mycelium associated with sclerotic cells. This proliferation manifests as a well-defined, chronically progressive, crusted ulceration of the skin known as chromoblastomycosis. Clinically it is often misdiagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. =Histology= The disease is characterized by the appearance of spherical, brownish yellow cells with thick, darkly pigmented walls. The presence of the agent is associated with host cell proliferation and enlargement known as hyperplasia localized to the stratified squamous epithelium and the formation of mycotic granulomas. Sclerotic bodies are present both extracellularly and intracellularly throughout the affected tissue and are a defining feature of chromoblastomycosis. The melanin content of sclerotic bodies may be important in the establishment of host immune responses. =Risk factors for infection= Farmers in Central and South America are most susceptible to chromoblastomycosis due to F. pedrosoi. Infection often occurs in the upper body and legs of agricultural laborers since these areas are more prone to exposure to infected soil, plant debris or other fomites. The sex ratio of disease is globally variable. In Brazil, the agent has shown a 4:1 proclivity for men, likely as a function of exposure differences relating to work and lifestyle, while Japanese infections have shown evenly distributed infection rates between the sexes. =Treatment= Infections by F. pedrosoi are more difficult to treat than those of F. monophora. In severe cases, treatment is quite complex and involves a combination of antifungal drug therapy and surgical excision. Antifungal agents like itraconazole and terbinafine are commonly used. Surgery is often used to treat small, localized infections, although cryotherapy has been suggested an alternative approach. Topical application of amphotericin B followed by long-term administration of oral antifungal therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of corneal chromoblastomycosis from F. pedrosoi. The diagnosis and treatment of chromoblastomycosis by F. pedrosoi remains clinically challenging due to the relative rarity of the disease, its slow, chronic nature, the absence of clinical features readily differentiating it from other more common diseases such as squamous cell carcinoma, the restricted nature of therapies, and the lack of literature.

Plot When his son-in-law comes to him with a woeful tale of an unhappy relationship and a belief that all women are impossible to love, elderly Sir Humphrey Tavistock calmly puts him straight. Tavistock regales him with decades-old anecdotes of found lovers and lost love. We meet in flashback the free-thinking Ambrosine Viney, an independent woman ahead of her time, and the sophisticated Louise Tiere, a diplomat's wife. There are others as well, including one whom Tavistock adores and marries, only to lose her forever during childbirth. Cast * Laurence Harvey as Sir Humphrey Tavistock * Julie Harris as Helen Cooper * Diane Cilento as Ambrosine Viney * Mai Zetterling as Julie * Eva Gabor as Louise * Michael Denison as Rollo * Derek Farr as Anthony * Elina Labourdette as Comtesse * Roland Culver as Charles Tavistock * Wilfrid Hyde-White as Sir George Tavistock * Robert Rietti as the Sultan * Catherine Boyle (Katie Boyle) as Diana * Ambrosine Phillpotts as Lady Tavistock * Jocelyn Lane as Saida (billed as Jackie Lane) * Lisa Gastoni as Mary Maguire Critical reception TV Guide: \\"the direction is simply too serious for what should have been a much lighter comedy, so the film falls far short of its intentions\\". The New York Times: \\"an erratic but basically good- natured color pacing written, directed and produced by Muriel and Sydney Box. With Laurence Harvey heading a large, impressive cast...Visually, the picture is luscious. The five episodes that carry the well-born hero from young manhood to the fireside spread out over beautifully tinted, lavish period and modern settings. The small army of ladies engulfing the poor bloke have been dressed to kill by an expert, Cecil Beaton. Smoothly, deviously and knowingly the picture slides along as if a good joke were tucked up one of the Beaton sleeves...As an uncomplicated young painter who marries him and eventually dies in childbirth, our own American Miss Harris is splendid, far and away the best and least glittering thing in the picture. Her meeting with Mr. Harvey, in a stranded elevator, is a gem of a scene. The last section, as Mr. Harvey almost attains happiness with a wise, unselfish nurse, movingly played by Miss Zetterling, slides appropriately into a bittersweet but lighthearted fade-out. Of the large cast, such people as Michael Denison, Derek Farr, Marius Goring, Roland Culver and Wilfred Hyde-White bolster the opulent tapestry with effective bits. As for why it should take an intelligent, red-blooded Englishman more than fifty years to discover the \\"truth,\\" as Mr. Harvey finally states it, we thought they learned that at Eton.\\" References Category:1957 films Category:British films Category:1957 comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Muriel Box Category:British comedy films Category:Films with screenplays by Muriel Box Category:Films with screenplays by Sydney Box Category:Films produced by Sydney Box ","title":"The Truth About Women"},{"id":"21761051","text":"Academy Grove Historic District is a national historic district at Upper Fairmount, Somerset County, Maryland, United States.

It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Set on a fictional, medieval- inspired landmass known as \\"the Continent\\", The Witcher explores the legend of Geralt of Rivia and princess Ciri, who are linked to each other by destiny. It stars Henry Cavill, Freya Allan and Anya Chalotra. The first season consisted of eight episodes and was released on Netflix in its entirety on December 20, 2019.

Episodes The first season is based on The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. A website with timelines for the show, along with in-depth summaries of events, was later created by Netflix. ProductionDevelopment= Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher book series was almost adapted into a standalone Netflix film, but Kelly Luegenbiehl, Vice President of International Originals at Netflix, dissuaded the producers. She recalled asking them, \\"How can you take eight novels and just turn it into a film? There's so much material here. Through a number of conversations, the producers got really excited about the idea of using the source material for a longer-running series.\\" In May 2017, Netflix announced the start of production on an English-language drama TV series based on the books. In December 2017, it was reported that Lauren Schmidt Hissrich would serve as showrunner on the show. In April 2018, Schmidt Hissrich revealed that the script for the pilot episode was finished, and the first season would be eight episodes long. In 2017, it was reported that Andrzej Sapkowski would serve as a creative consultant on the show, but in January 2018, Sapkowski denied any direct involvement. However, he met with Schmidt Hissrich in April 2018 and in May 2018 she stated that Sapkowski was on the creative team of the project. In August, Andrew Laws was revealed as production designer. In December, Radio Times reported directors Alik Sakharov and Charlotte Br√§ndstr√∂m had joined the project. Netflix announced a second season on November 13, 2019, subtitled \\"Mysterious Monsters\\", with production set to begin in London in early 2020, for a planned release in 2021. =Writing= The first season was told in a non-linear manner, spanning different time periods. Hissrich said this was inspired by Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk. She pointed out that Yennefer's story covers around 70 years and Ciri's only about 2 weeks. \\"The Witcher's confusing timelines explained\\"] 'Gamespot' Hissrich also said that Yennefer and Cirilla were given more prominence to allow the viewers to understand them better. By showing their backstories, along with Geralt's, \\"we get down to the soul of the story. It's the story of a broken family. It's a story of three people who are on their own in the world, really orphans all living in the margins of society who are determined to not need anyone, and yet of course they do.\\" Hissrich said the story for the second season will build on the foundations of the first season, becoming more focused; the characters will interact with each other more frequently. \\"When I talk about The Witcher, I always talk about how these three characters coming together ‚Äî Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer ‚Äî they come together as a family. It‚Äôs the most important part of the series for me,\\" Hissrich said. \\"And when you start to imagine someone‚Äôs family, you also need to understand their family of origin. For Geralt, it‚Äôs his brothers, it‚Äôs the brotherhood of the witchers. So I‚Äôm really excited to get back in and meet Vesemir, his father figure, for the first time and all of these men that he was raised with since he was seven years old.\\" =Casting= Freya Allan, Henry Cavill and Anya Chalotra at the 2019 San Diego Convention for The Witcher In September 2018, Netflix announced that Henry Cavill would play Geralt of Rivia. He was selected from more than 200 actors. In October 2018, Freya Allan and Anya Chalotra were cast as Princess Cirilla and Yennefer of Vengerberg respectively, while Jodhi May, Bj√∂rn Hlynur Haraldsson, Adam Levy, MyAnna Buring, Mimi Ndiweni, and Therica Wilson-Read also joined. More casting was announced later that month, including Eamon Farren, Joey Batey, Lars Mikkelsen, Royce Pierreson, Maciej Musia≈Ç, Wilson Radjou-Pujalte, and Anna Shaffer. In February 2020, Netflix announced Kim Bodnia had been cast as Vesemir, an experienced witcher and a mentor to Geralt. Other additions included Kristofer Hivju, Yasen Atour, Agnes Born, Paul Bullion, Thue Ersted Rasmussen, Aisha Fabienne Ross, and Mecia Simson. In September 2020, it was announced that Basil Eidenbenz would replace Rasmussen in the role of Eskel. =Filming= In April 2018, Schmidt Hissrich revealed that the show would be filmed in Central and Eastern Europe. Principal photography for the first season began on October 31, 2018, in Hungary. Much of the series was filmed at Mafilm Studios near Budapest; the outdoor set included the exterior of wizard Stregobor's household. The hall in Cintra was constructed at Origo Studios on the outskirts of Budapest. Fort Monostor (Monostori Erod), and the nearby forest was used for some exterior scenes in Cintra. The Battle of Marnadal was filmed in the hills of a village in Hungary, Cs√°kber√©ny. The village that was Yennefer's original home was filmed at the Skanzen Village Museum, an open-air site near Szentendre some north of Budapest; this location was also used in scenes with Ciri in an area with a windmill. The production used the exteriors of Burg Kreuzenstein, a castle near Leobendorf, Austria, for the abandoned fictional castle Vizima, but the interiors were filmed at Origo Studios. In March 2019, production commenced on Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands, Spain. Some scenes were to be shot on the islands of La Palma and La Gomera, as well. Scenes of the Sorcerers' Aretuza Academy (Tower of the Gull) were shot on Roque de Santo Domingo in Garaf√≠a, an islet, and enhanced with CGI. However, the interiors used for the graduation ball were at the Kiscelli Museum in √ìbuda. The museum was a monastery in the 18th century. This location was also used for the conclave of the Northern Mages. The Barranco de Fataga area on Gran Canaria island was used for some scenes of arid landscapes. When Ciri was traveling in the desert, the actress was actually in the Natural Dune Reserve of Maspalomas on Gran Canaria. Most of episode six was filmed on La Palma island. Filming of the first season concluded in Ogrodzieniec Castle in Poland. The ruins of this medieval castle, dating from the 1300s, were the backdrop for scenes including the fictional Vilgefortz of Roggeveen and Triss Merigold. The ruins were also included when shooting the Battle of Sodden Hill in the final episode of Season 1. Filming for the first season wrapped in May 2019. Filming for the second season began in London in early 2020, but was halted for two weeks in March due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic and actor Kristofer Hivju's confirmation that he tested positive for COVID-19. Then, in May 2020, film and television productions that were filming in the U.K. were given permission to resume filming, including season two of The Witcher. The show resumed pre- production in July and officially resumed filming on August 12, 2020, with filming for the second season expected to extend into early 2021. =Music= The original song \\"Toss a Coin to Your Witcher\\", composed by Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli and sung by Jaskier (Batey) in the second episode, became a viral hit shortly after the series' release. Users have created mods to patch the song into the video game adaptions of The Witcher. All violin solos, for the entire series, were performed by Lindsay Deutsch. Release A Witcher TV series advertisement in form of a mural in Poland In April 2019, Netflix's Ted Sarandos told investors in an earnings call that the series would be released in late 2019. The series premiered on December 20, 2019. =Marketing= Netflix released the first teaser for the series at San Diego Comic-Con on July 19, 2019. The first full trailer was revealed at Lucca Comics & Games on October 31, 2019. Netflix released a final trailer on December 12, 2019. On August 26, 2020 a making-of about the first season of the show titled Making The Witcher was released on Netflix. On September 2, 2020 the making-of series The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes premiered on Netflix. ReceptionCritical reception= The first season received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the production values, action sequences, soundtrack, and Cavill's performance; criticism was mainly focused on the pacing and the lack of world-building. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 67% approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 6.21/10, based on 88 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Though the world of The Witcher at times feels only half- formed, Henry Cavill brings brawny charisma to a series teeming with subversive fantasy elements and dark humor.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 53 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a positive review of the first season, Erik Kain of Forbes wrote, \\"If you're looking for an original dark fantasy with some horror elements, some bare skin and plenty of blood and gore (and monsters) look no further.\\", while James Whitbrook of io9 said, \\"if you are willing to sit through those trudging opening episodes, punctuated by a cool fight here or an intriguing character scene there, The Witcher slowly but surely finds itself a fantastical slice of bloody, schlocky fun.\\" Conversely, Entertainment Weekly critic Darren Franich said, \\"my destiny is to never watch this borefest ever again\\", awarding the first season an F rating. Franich drew criticism when he confessed to watching only the first, second, and fifth episodes. Author Andrzej Sapkowski, commenting favorably on the show, stated, \\"I was more than happy with Henry Cavill's appearance as The Witcher. He's a real professional. Just as Viggo Mortensen gave his face to Aragorn (in The Lord of the Rings), so Henry gave his to Geralt ‚Äî and it shall be forever so.\\" Sapkowski added, \\"I shall be happy if the viewers ‚Äî and readers ‚Äî take anything away, anything that shall enrich them in some way. Also, I sincerely hope to leave the viewers ‚Äî and readers ‚Äî hot. In every sense. Not tepid, not lukewarm.\\" =Audience viewership= According to Parrot Analytics, The Witcher, in its US debut, was the third most \\"in demand\\" original streaming series, behind Stranger Things and The Mandalorian. Parrot's process measures \\"demand expressions\\", which is \\"its globally standardized TV-demand measurement unit that reflects the desire, engagement, and viewership of a series weighted by importance.\\" On December 31, 2019, Parrot Analytics reported that The Witcher became the most-in-demand TV series in the world, across all platforms. On December 30, 2019, Netflix issued a number of official lists, including the Most Popular TV Shows of 2019. The series was among the most viewed in the U.S. market, where The Witcher was ranked second among series. On January 21, 2020, Netflix announced that the first season had been viewed by over 76 million viewers on its service within its first month of release. Netflix had recently changed its viewership metric, from 70% of an episode under the previous metric, down to two minutes under the new metric. The new metric gives viewing figures 35% higher on average than the previous one. The 76million views in its first month based on the new metric (at least two minutes or more) is the largest for a Netflix series launch since the introduction of the new viewership metric. Sales of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in December 2019 were 554% greater than those from December 2018, attributed to renewed interest in the series due to the show. Spin-offs In January 2020, Netflix announced an animated spin-off film titled The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf focusing on the origin story of Geralt's mentor and fellow witcher Vesemir. Lauren Schmidt Hissrich and Beau DeMayo are working on the film, with production by Studio Mir. A live-action prequel limited series, The Witcher: Blood Origin was announced by Netflix in July 2020, set 1200 years before Geralt's time to show the origin of the Witchers. The prequel is also being developed by Hissrich. She will executive produce and Declan de Barra will showrun.

History thumb28th Fighter Squadron P-39Q AiracobraAircraft is Bell P-39Q-20-BE Airacobra serial 44-3866. Markings include squadron number 97 and tail code of Triangle H, assigned by Sixth Air Force, about December 1944. =World War II= Established in 1939 as the 28th Pursuit Squadron and activated on 1 February 1940 at Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone. The squadron was formed from a collection of four officers and enlisted ranks drawn from Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, 16th Pursuit Group, the 24th Pursuit Squadron, the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron, the 29th Pursuit Squadron, the 74th Bombardment Squadron and the 15th Air Base Squadron. Initially equipped with Boeing P-26A Peashooters, the mission of the squadron was air defense of the Panama Canal. This remained the squadron's mission throughout its existence in Sixth Air Force. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the squadron was dispersed to Paitilla Point Field, Panama, and re-equipped with some Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. By March 1942, was moved to La Joya #2 Aerodrome in Panama where it remained until 2 May 1942, only to return to Paitilla Point again in June. Was redesignated as the 28th Fighter Squadron on 15 May as part of a USAAF-wide renaming program. The unit then remained there until November, when it moved again to Chame Field, Panama. In November 1943, the Squadron was assigned directly to XXVI Fighter Command, and by December, the unit had been re-equipped with Bell P-39Q Airacobras. By February 1944, the Squadron was maintaining a detachment at Pocri Field, Panama. In May 1945, conversion to Lockheed P-38 Lightnings began, however, no sooner had conversion to the P-38s been completed than the unit was moved to Howard Field, where the entire complement of P-38s was hangared and the unit activities ran down with the end of the war in Europe. The squadron ceased all flying activities in June, and the P-38s were reassigned to other units in the command while personnel were returned to the United States. By October 1945, the squadron was reduced to a non-operational administrative organization. Inactivated on 15 October 1946. During the Cold War, the squadron was reactivated by Tactical Air Command as the 28th Fighter- Bomber Squadron at Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico on 8 April 1953 and was programmed to receive North American F-86F Sabres. However, the squadron did not become operationalRavenstein, pp.65‚Äì66 and it was inactivated on 25 June. =Test unit= The squadron was redesignated the 28th Test Squadron and activated as an Air Combat Command test squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in 1993.

It made its appearance in the country at the beginning of the 17th century, introduced by Catholic missionaries, especially Jesuits, who went there in order to catechize and accultate the native indigenous peoples and assist the Portuguese in the colonizing process. In the course of the Colonial period, expressed a close association between the Church and the State, but in the colony there was not a court that would serve as a patron of the arts, the elites did not bother to build palaces, or to help sponsor the profane arts, but at the end of the period, and how the religion had a strong influence on the daily lives of everyone in this group of factors derives from the vast majority of the legacy of the Brazilian Baroque period, is the sacred art: statuary, painting, and the work of carving for the decoration of churches and convents, or for private worship. The most typical characteristics of the Baroque, usually described as a dynamic, narrative, ornamental, dramatic style, cultivating contrasts and a seductive plasticity, convey a programmatic content articulated with exquisite rhetoric and great pragmatism. Baroque art was an art in functional essence, paying very well for the purposes it was put to serve: in addition to its purely decorative function, it facilitated the absorption of Catholic doctrine and traditional customs by neophytes, being an efficient pedagogical and catechetic instrument. In literature, Bento Teixeira's epic poem \\"Prosopopeia\\" (1601) is regarded as the initial landmark, reaching its zenith with the poet Greg√≥rio de Matos and the sacred orator Priest Ant√≥nio Vieira. In the plastic arts its greatest exponents were Aleijadinho and Master Ata√≠de. In the field of architecture this school took root mainly in the Northeast and in Minas Gerais, but left large and numerous examples throughout almost the rest of the country, from Rio Grande do Sul to Par√°. As for music, it is known from literary accounts that it was also prodigal, but, unlike the other arts, almost nothing was saved. With the development of Neoclassicism and Academism from the first decades of the 19th century, the Baroque tradition quickly fell into disuse in the elite culture. But it survived in popular culture, especially in interior regions, in the work of Santeiros and in some festivities. Since the Modernist intellectuals began, in the beginning of the 20th century, a process of rescuing the national Baroque, large number of buildings and collections of art have already been protected by the government, in its various instances, through the declaration of protected heritage, musealization or other processes, attesting the official recognition of the importance of the Baroque for the history of Brazilian culture. Baroque Historic Centers such as those of the cities of Ouro Preto, Olinda and Salvador and artistic ensembles such as the Sanctuary of the Bom Jesus de Matosinhos were granted the status of World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO seal. This precious heritage is one of the great attractions of cultural tourism in the country, at the same time that it becomes an identifier of Brazil, both for locals and for foreigners. Despite its importance, much of the material legacy of the Brazilian Baroque is in a poor state of conservation and requires restoration and other conservative measures, and there are often losses or degradation of valuable specimens in all artistic modalities. The country still has much to do to preserve such an important part of its history, tradition and culture. On the other hand, there seems to be growing awareness of the general population about the need to protect a heritage that is of all and that can benefit all, a benefit even economic, if well managed and conserved. National Museums every day strive to improve its techniques and procedures, the bibliography grows, the government has invested a lot in this area and even the good market that the National Baroque art always finds help in its valorization as worthy pieces of attention and care. The European model and its Brazilianization Pope St. Peter, from the most learned Portuguese school. Museum of Sacred Art of S√£o Paulo The Baroque was born in Italy in the turn of the 16th to the 17th century, in the midst of one of the greatest spiritual crises Europe had ever faced: the Protestant Reformation, which split the continent's ancient religious unity and sparked an international political rearrangement in which the once almighty Catholic Church has lost strength and space. It was a style of reaction against Classicism of the Renaissance, whose foundations revolved around symmetry, proportionality, economics, rationality, and formal equilibrium. Thus, Baroque aesthetics prevailed by asymmetry, excess, expressive and irregular, so much so that the term \\"Baroque\\", which named the style, designated a bizarre and irregular shaped pearl. In addition to an aesthetic tendency, these traits constituted a true way of life and set the tone for the entire culture of the period, a culture that emphasized contrast, conflict, dynamic, dramatic, grandiloquent, dissolution of boundaries, along with an accentuated taste for the opulence of shapes and materials, making it a perfect vehicle for the Counter-Reformation Catholic Church and the rising absolutist monarchies to visibly express their ideals of glory and pomp. The monumental structures erected during the Baroque, such as the palaces and the great theaters and churches, sought to create a spectacular and exuberant nature impact, proposing an integration between the various artistic languages and trapping the viewer in a cathartic, apotheotic, engaging and passionate atmosphere. This aesthetic had wide acceptance in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in Portugal, whose culture, besides being essentially Catholic and monarchical, in which officially united Church and State and delimited loose and indistinct boundaries between public and private, was impregnated with millennialism and mysticism, favoring an ubiquitous and superstitious religiosity characterized by emotional intensity. And from Portugal the movement moved to its colony in South America, where the cultural context of the indigenous peoples, marked by ritualism and festivity, provided a receptive background.

The company owns Clar√≠n, a newspaper with the largest circulation in Argentina that prints over 1,000,000 copies of its Sunday edition. Canal 13 is the second most popular TV station in Buenos Aires and Grupo Clar√≠n owns it, too, among many other media assets. The four largest media conglomerates in Argentina cover almost half of the national audience. One of the mega media companies, Grupo Clar√≠n, covers 25% of the national audience. Clar√≠n owns three of the ten largest newspapers: Clar√≠n, La Voz del Interior (from C√≥rdoba), and Los Andes. These three papers represented nearly half the national newspaper reading audience in 2018. After Grupo Clar√≠n came into the audiovisual media market in 1989, it became the biggest media group in Argentina. Clar√≠n owns over half of the pay-TV market and has significant power in controlling news, paper, film, and TV production companies. Telef√≥nica is another major player in Argentine media. Telef√≥nica owns commercial broadcast TV stations as well as landline-based and cell phone companies. (It does not, however, own any print media). Finally, Grupo Vila- Manzano is another large and significant power in Argentina‚Äôs media landscape. The company began within the Mendoza province and expanded to the rest of the nation, although it does not have much market penetration in Buenos Aires. Vila-Manzano owns pay-TV, local newspaper in provincial (state) capitals, radio stations, and TV stations. = Grupo Am√©rica = Grupo Am√©rica logo In Argentina, the largest media companies don‚Äôt make most of their money from media services. Instead, they make the majority of their revenue from other businesses and industries. For example, Grupo Am√©rica is a media company owned by two businessmen, Daniel Vila and Jos√© Luis Manzano. It owns large firms in energy, oil, and public service supplies. One of the company‚Äôs partners owns Swiss Medical Group, the largest private healthcare company in Argentina. Grupo Am√©rica (formerly, Grupo UNO) is focused on free TV and radio ever since it sold its cable TV company Supercanal in 2018. The company has 28 licenses between AM, FM and open television broadcasting. Manzano and Vila control to broadcast channel Am√©rica TV and its cable TV channel Am√©rica 24, La Red radio and newspaper networks including La Capital del Rosario and Diario UNO in Entre Rios, Mendoza and Santa Fe. With its extensive network of media services, the company reaches about 25 million people in Argentina and thus constitutes the second largest multimedia group in the country. = Grupo Indalo = Grupo Indalo holds interests in radio, TV and print. However, at the time of the MOM study, the company‚Äôs owners were in prison related to a judicial investigation. Foreign investment companies, such as Viacom, Turner and Fox, mostly run the most popular TV stations. = Others = Telefe (owned by ViacomCBS), Grupo La Naci√≥n and Grupo Perfil are smaller media groups. Unlike the big conglomerates, they earn most of their income from content production and publishing.  History  Prior to and during President Juan Per√≥n‚Äôs final period of rule (1973-1974), and that of his widow Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n (1974-1976), and the direct military rule that would follow, journalism was censored and the regime suppressed release of information about the disappearance of over 11,000 Argentinians during his time in office. However, since the country‚Äôs return to a democratic government in 1983, the country became home to ‚Äúone of South America‚Äôs leading media markets.‚Äù When the Per√≥n regime first began, the country‚Äôs oldest newspaper La Prensa butted heads with the regime, battling it out on its daily pages. Eventually, Per√≥n took it over by force. When the country‚Äôs government was restored to democracy, ‚Äúharassment of the media stopped.‚Äù President Mauricio Macri, in office from 2015-2019, upon entering his office, created a set of new rules to regulate the country‚Äôs media. His decrees also created a new government agency to implement his new rules. According to Human Rights Watch, the new agency reported to the executive branch, thus ‚Äúcompromising its ability to act independently from government interests.‚Äù As of 2019, large media groups have experienced a growth in profits and earnings. However, Argentina is in an economic crisis. Media salaries dropped by 30 percent or more. Over 20 media outlets have closed since 2016. Over 3,500 employees lost their jobs over a recent two-year period.  Internet service and industry  In 2018, 90 percent of Internet users in Argentina got their news information from the Internet each week -- a higher number than those who got it from TV or print newspapers and magazines. When Grupo Clar√≠n (the largest media company in the country) merged with Telecom, over half of Argentinians using the Internet got their service from the new merged company. The merger also created the first ever company in Argentina to be allowed to offer what is known as ‚Äúquadruple play‚Äù: landline, mobile, cable, and Internet services to consumers. All other companies wishing to offer quadruple play were required to wait until January 2019.  Government deregulation and funding gives rise to media consolidation  According to RSF, national deregulation of the industry gave way to the conglomerates becoming more powerful among the media landscape. Mauricio Macri became President in 2015. In his first month in office, he changed the rules about media concentration. It allowed media companies to be bigger and larger and more powerful. The national government gives money to media companies. It gives money for advertising, financial help, loan forgiveness, debt redemption, and license extensions. This type of leverage creates a dependent relationship between the media and the government. Because of President Macri's changes to the regulatory landscape, Clar√≠n expanded its business into the telecommunications industry. Clar√≠n's cable division (called Cablevisi√≥n) merged with a big company called Telecom. It became \\"the largest media conglomerate in the history of communications in Argentina.\\"  Legal trends  In 2009, there were two events that are considered significant factors to the modern transformation of the country‚Äôs media system. One was passage of the Audiovisual Communication Services Law (Ley de Servicios de Comunicaci√≥n Audiovisual) (also known as the ‚ÄúSCA Law‚Äù). The other was the country‚Äôs adoption of TDT, a digital standard for ‚Äúterrestrial digital TV.‚Äù The new SCA Law replaced the older law, which was ‚Äúinherited from the last military dictatorship (1976‚Äì1983), which in turn had been amended over a period of 20 years.‚Äù The SCA Law made a number of changes. It created regulations for the digitization process within the media industry; reserved portions of the spectrum for non-profit groups; required private media companies to abide by certain ‚Äúpublic service obligations‚Äù; gave licenses to native Argentinian communities; improved access to media for the hearing and visual impaired; created a new regulatory body (independent of the executive branch); made telecommunications license holders provide a certain degree of transparency; and banned phone companies from having media licenses. Many large Argentine media groups strongly opposed the SCA Law, and there was even a flood of litigation after its passage and implementation. Opposition political parties even refused to cooperate once it was passed.

Born to a family of small estancieiros (ranchers), Mau√° became one of the world's richest men; by 1867, his wealth was larger than the annual budget of the Brazilian Empire. He was called the Rothschild of the South American continent by the New York Times in 1871. He received the titles of baron (1854) and visconde com grandeza (viscount with greatness) (1874) of Mau√°. A pioneer in several areas of the economy of Brazil, one of his greatest achievements was to start the construction of the Mau√° Railroad, the first railroad in Brazil. At his peak, Mau√° controlled eight of the country's ten largest companies (the remaining two were state-owned); his banking interests stretched over to Britain, France, the United States and Argentina. Mau√° also founded the first bank in Uruguay (Banco Mau√° Y Cia). Mau√°, who established the modern Banco do Brasil, is credited with financing much of the Brazilian economy activity in the 19th century, particularly in coffee plantation, and with the construction of the first railroads, shipyard and cast iron metalwork in the country. Mau√° commissioned the first telegraphic submarine cable connecting South America to Europe, developed commercial transportation via steamboats on rivers Amazon and Gua√≠ba, and installed the first gas-fueled street lights in the city of Rio de Janeiro, then Brazil's capital.

Case  After her Jonathan Littleton's death, Littleton brought a medical malpractice suit against her husband's doctor, Mark Prange.Dahir, Mubarak (October 10, 2000). Genetics vs. love. The Advocate The defense attorney argued that the marriage was invalid because Littleton was a biological male. On appeal, Chief Justice Phil Hardberger relied on the fact that \\"Texas statutes do not allow same-sex marriages\\" and that \\"male chromosomes do not change with either hormonal treatment or sex reassignment surgery\\" in handing down his judgment that \\"Christie Littleton is a male. As a male, Christie cannot be married to another male. Her marriage to Jonathon was invalid, and she cannot bring a cause of action as his surviving spouse.\\"Littleton v.

The legs, including the claws, have bands of colour, in red, orange and white, and the claws bear short spines on the dorsal surface. The eyestalks are short, but bear large black compound eyes. P. armatus can be told apart from the similar P. ochotensis by the spines on its claws, which in P. ochotensis are replaced by granules. The two species are so similar that they have sometimes been considered members of the same species, but are now generally thought to be two distinct species.

The skatepark at the Green. Devonshire Green is a small public open space at within Sheffield city centre in South Yorkshire, England. It covers an area of approximately 9000 square metres and is designated as a district park by Sheffield City Council. It stands in the Devonshire Quarter of the city centre, bordered on its four sides by Devonshire Street, Fitzwilliam Street, Eldon Street and Wellington Street. It is the only large green space in the city centre. History Prior to World War II the area which is now Devonshire Green was a neighbourhood of housing and small firms. This area had originally been built in the first half of the 19th century on land belonging to William FitzWilliam, the 4th Earl FitzWilliam of Wentworth Woodhouse who was the local lord of the manor.\\"A History Of Sheffield\\", David Hey, Page 116 Gives early history of Devonshire Green area.\\"Old Ordnance Survey Maps : Sheffield (West)\\", Gives history and pre war street names.

After the war the site was cleared and remained as an undeveloped area, eventually serving as a temporary car parking area for the city centre. In 1981 Devonshire Green was created as a public green area with seating and pedestrian footpaths crossing it, it was officially dedicated to those who died in the Blitz of 1940. In the 1990s a floodlit skatepark was built on the southern part of the Green for skateboarders and BMX bikers. By the early part of the 21st century the Green was looking rundown and needed a facelift with large flocks of pigeons gathering in the area. The building of much new property around the Green prompted the creation of the Devonshire Quarter Action Plan which urged investment for the benefit of new residents.Sheffield Council leaflet.

History The Guild of St. Stephen was founded in 1904 by Father Hamilton McDonald when he formed a society of altar servers at the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) in London. In 1905, Pope Pius X, gave his approbation to the canonical establishment of the Guild at Westminster Cathedral. In 1906, the Sacred Congregation of Rites made the guild an Archconfraternity, enabling all the parish branches to be linked with it. In 1934, the Guild spread, leading to Pope Pius XI's enabling of all Guilds throughout the British Commonwealth to be affiliated with the Archconfraternity at Westminster. The Guild is primarily under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as that of St. Stephen (the Protomartyr, after whom the Guild was named), St. Thomas More, and St. Pius X. Purpose The purpose of the Guild of St. Stephen is \\"to encourage, positively and practically, the highest standards of serving at the Church's liturgy and so contribute to the whole community's participation in a more fruitful worship of God, to provide altar servers with a greater understanding of what they are doing so that they may serve with increasing reverence and prayerfulness and thereby be led to a deepening response to their vocation in life, and to unite servers of different parishes and dioceses for their mutual support and encouragement.\\" Medals Upon enrollment into the Guild, the server is presented with the Guild Medal, which is made of bronze and is worn around the neck, hanging from a red cord. The medal's meaning is twofold: firstly, that the parish priest, or local director of the Guild, has decided this particular server is eligible and worthy to be admitted to the Guild. Secondly, the server accepts and wears the medal as a sign of commitment to serve regularly as well as possible. The letters \\"XP\\" are in the center of the medal, being the first two letters of the name \\"Christ\\" in Greek. At the top is the crown of victory given by God to everyone who overcomes evil, especially those who die for him. At the bottom are palm branches, traditional signs of martyrs who died for Christ. The motto of the Guild, \\"Cvi Servire Regnare Est,\\" which means \\"To Serve is to Reign,\\" is located around the edge of the front of the medal. The Latin words \\"Sancti Stephani Archi Soldalitas,\\" or \\"Archconfraternity of Saint Stephen,\\" are located around the edge on the back. The material of the medal varies depending on how long a server has been a member of the Guild: The Bronze Medal is that which is given to a server upon enrollment; The Silver Medal, after 10 years of serving. The Silver Medal of Merit, is given after 20 years of serving, and the Gold Medal, after 50 years. Other medals of the Guild include the Wooden Cross (which is used by some parishes for Altar Servers who have started serving prior to their enrollment), the Centenary Medal, which was commissioned for the centenary of the Guild in 2004, and the Gold Medal of Merit, which is granted to a server after 50 years of serving, but only to those enrolled after the age of 13. Organization The Guild of St. Stephen is led by the Superior General of the Archconfraternity, the Archbishop of Westminster. The National Director, appointed by the Archbishop, reports directly to the former. A lay Central Council, consisting of a Lay President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and other members, assists in the running of the Guild. The Central Council is responsible for running the business side of the Guild. Many diocesan bishops appoint a Priest Director of the Guild for their own diocese and together these form a National Council of Priest Directors, which is an advisory body to the National Director. Some dioceses have organised their own local Lay Councils to assist the Diocesan Director in furthering the work of the Guild. The Guild may be erected in any parish with the permission of the bishop of the diocese and shall then be affiliated to the Archconfraternity at Westminster Cathedral. Thus, in each parish, while maintaining its objects and keeping the rules of the Archconfraternity, the Guild can be independent in its constitution and organisation. Membership Membership of the Guild is open to any server, regardless of age, who can serve Mass, and has shown a wish to live up to the objects and standards of the Guild. Servers must be given adequate training and reach the necessary standard before being admitted to the sanctuary. They should then should serve satisfactorily for a minimum of six months before being enrolled as a member of the Guild. The parish priest, or the local director of the Guild, decides whether a candidate is eligible and worthy of admission to the Guild, and is empowered to perform the ceremony of enrollment and invest the server with the Guild medal. Members of the Guild of St. Stephen are bound to follow various rules, including: Serving at the altar with reverence, understanding and regularity and with due attention to personal cleanliness and tidiness; Saying short prayers in preparation for and in thanksgiving after, serving Mass; Observing silence in the sacristy and great reverence in the sanctuary; Reciting the Prayer of the Guild of St. Stephen every day.
