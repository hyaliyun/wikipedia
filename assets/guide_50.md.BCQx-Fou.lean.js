His father was renowned in the fields of orchard pests and fruit hybridization, was a founding member of the Entomological Society of Ontario and published books including Insects Injurious to Fruits (1883, J. B. Lippincott & Co.) and numerous scientific papers. He was recognized with honorary degrees from several universities and by honours from King George VI. Saunders studied Physics at Johns Hopkins University and worked under Henry A. Rowland, a pioneer in use of diffraction gratings for spectroscopy, graduating PhD in 1899. He tutored in Physics at Haverford College from 1899 to 1901, then at Syracuse University where he reached the status of Professor in 1914. At Syracuse he worked with Alfred Fowler studying spectra in the far infra-red region, and during his sabbatical year 1913‚Äì14 worked with Friedrich Paschen at the University of T√ºbingen. Shortly after his return to America, he took a teaching position at Vassar College, and during World War I worked with Augustus Trowbridge (1870‚Äì1934), Karl Taylor Compton and Henry Norris Russell, developing methods of sound ranging. With Russell he would later develop Russell‚ÄìSaunders coupling. In 1918 he worked as spectroscopist under R. A. Millikan at the National Research Council in Washington D.C., followed by a short stint at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, as the guest of Willis Whitney. After a brief return to Vassar, he was invited to Harvard University by Theodore Lyman to continue his spectrographic work, then was appointed by that institution to take over the fundamentals course from the recently deceased Wallace C.

It began as a radical fringe of the Church of England, but split from the Church and later became part of the Brownist or puritan Separatist movement. William Bradford, Governor of Plymouth Plantation, cited the underground church as the first that ‚Äòprofessed and practised the cause‚Äô of the Pilgrim Fathers.  Marian underground  The underground Protestant church in London in Queen Mary's time was a forerunner of the Elizabethan underground church. It was formed in response to the Queen's campaign to re-establish Catholicism and burn Protestants as heretics. It began with 20 people and grew to 200. They met in inns and private houses. Ministers of the church included Thomas Rose, the martyr John Rough, Augustine Bernher, and Thomas Bentham who under Elizabeth became Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. As well as Rough, members who were executed included the deacon Cutbert Symson and Margaret Mearing.  Elizabethan underground  The underground church dissolved when Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558 and undertook a Protestant reformation of the Church of England. Her attempts to impose some traditional vestments on all ministers, however, gave rise to puritanism, a movement to purify the Church of such traditions. In the crisis of 1566, 37 London clergy were suspended for non-conformity and 14 eventually dismissed. The most radical started to lead illegal services, reviving the underground. One member, John Smith, later explained: ‚ÄòWhen it came to this point, that all our preachers were displaced by your law‚Ä¶ Then we bethought us what were best to do; and we remembered that there was a congregation of us in this city in Queen Mary‚Äôs days.‚Äô On 16 June 1567, a hundred people were discovered worshipping in Plumbers‚Äô Hall, Anchor Lane, and 17 arrested. Some were questioned by the Bishop of London, Edmund Grindal, and wrote a transcript of the interview. Other notable arrests occurred off Pudding Lane, in the house of James Tynne, a goldsmith, and in the dwelling of Bishop Grindal's own servant. Grindal said that they also met ‚Äòsometimes in the fields, and occasionally even in ships‚Äô. Leaders of the movement included Richard Fitz, John Browne, Mr Pattenson (who also wrote up an interview with Grindal), William Bonham and Nicholas Crane (all ministers) and the layman William White. The historian of Separatism Stephen Tomkins argues that the underground church started out as a single citywide network before splitting into factions, and that they only gradually came to see themselves as Separatists from the Church of England. He suggests the church had a thousand members at its height, which would be one percent of the population of London. In 1568, leading members of the movement, with the agreement of William Cecil, went to Scotland, apparently with a view to taking their church into exile there, but decided against it. They were disappointed to be told by John Knox that he could not support their separation from the Church of England. William White wrote a tract justifying the illegal meetings of the underground church, A brief of such things as obscure Gods glory (undated). By the end of the 1560s, the movement had split into rival factions, one led by Fitz. This and the experience of persecution reduced the movement from perhaps a thousand Londoners to a small remnant, and yet the ‚ÄòFitz church‚Äô survived into the 1580s.  Under Henry Barrow  The puritans Henry Barrow and John Greenwood were converted to Separatism ‚Äì now known as Brownism after the Norfolk Separatist Robert Browne ‚Äì around 1586. The pair joined and revived the London Underground Church. The church met in fields in summer and houses in winter, from 5am, sometimes worshipping all day. The rejected written liturgy as ‚Äòbabbling in the Lord‚Äôs sight‚Äô and allowed any member to preach. According to a visitor, ‚ÄòIn their prayer, one speaketh and the rest do groan or sob or sigh, as if they would wring out tears.‚Äô The underground church, as taught by Barrow and Greenwood, believed that churches had to be voluntary communities of committed believers, and that the Church of England, which coerced the whole population into joining, was therefore not a true Church. They published their ideas in numerous books, printed through an illegal smuggling operation, in the Netherlands. A service in the house of one Henry Martin was raided on 8 October 1587 in the west London parish of St Andrew-by-the Wardrobe. 21 people were arrested, including Greenwood. Barrow visited him in the Clink prison on 19 November and was not allowed to leave. The pair were indicted under the 1581 Recusancy Act at the 1588 Newgate Sessions, fined ¬£260, then moved to the Fleet prison. The Archbishop's men now went beyond catching the congregation while meeting, and started raiding individual's home. Roger Jackson and Thomas Legate were taken from their beds and arrested for having writings by Barrow, without warrant. William Clarke, was jailed for complaining about the procedure. Quintin Smythe's feltmaking workshop was raided, revealing Brownist writings and a Bible, so he was kept in irons in Newgate. John Purdye was arrested and tortured in Bridewell. Seven died within 19 months. On 13 March 1589, church members presented a petition directly the Queen, for which three were arrested. The petition complained that they faced ‚Äòdaily spoiling, vexing, molesting, hurting, pursuing, imprisoning, yea, barring and locking them up close prisoners in the most unwholesome and vile prisons‚Äô. They said they were held without trial and appealed for an audience with the Privy Council. On 18 March, Barrow was interviewed by the Council, where he called the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, to his face, ‚Äòa monster, a miserable compound‚Äô. Other prisoners were interviewed before an episcopal court. By February 1590, 52 members of the underground church were being held in six London prisons. Ten had died in jail. The Bishop of London put together a team of 42 ministers and academics to visit the Brownists twice a week and engage in theological debate in order to win them back to the church ‚Äì or failing that to get evidence to be used against them in court. The conversations with Barrow and Greenwood went so well for the Separatists that they published their transcripts, illegally, and the bishop abandoned the scheme. In the winter of 1590-1, the church printed 2,000 copies of Barrow's magnum opus in Dort. On its way back though, the cargo was seized by the British governor at Flushing and Arthur Bellot, who was carrying it, was arrested. The minister of the English church in Middelburg, Francis Johnson, was tasked with burning the books, but kept one copy for himself. He was converted by it, joined the London church, and later became its minister. When a number of members were released in July 1592, including Greenwood, the church elected him as teacher and Johnson as pastor. They also chose deacons and elders. Greenwood and Johnson were arrested in December, along with their elder Daniel Studley. In February, Roger Rippon died in Newgate jail. Member of the church carried his coffin to the door of Justice Richard Young, an officer in the episcopal Court of High Commission, leaving it with an inscription saying ‚Äòhis blood crieth for speedy vengeance‚Äô. 56 people were arrested as a result, though only one admitted to taking part in the procession. The church gained a high-profile convert when John Penry joined the church in October 1592. Penry, described by Stephen Tomkins as ‚Äòthe most wanted puritan in England‚Äô, was one of the leading figures behind the notorious Martin Marprelate tracts. He petitioned Parliament in protest against their treatment, and the three women who delivered the document were arrested. Five Brownists, including Barrow and Greenwood were tried at the Old Bailey in March 1593 and sentenced to death under the Seditious Words and Rumours Act of 1581. The two leaders were hanged on 6 April and the other three released.  Under Francis Johnson  The Seditious Sectaries Act of 1593 outlawed the Brownist church, banishing its members from England on pain of death. A large part of the London congregation emigrated to Amsterdam, including some who were released from prison for the purpose. Others remained surreptitiously in London. Both groups were now led by Francis Johnson, though he was kept in the Clink prison. In 1597, Johnson and three others were released to go and scout out a Brownist colony in Newfoundland, with the blessing of the government. The expedition failed, and the four joined the Amsterdam church. This congregation thrived, growing to a few hundred, and produced a stream of propaganda against the Church of England that was smuggled back into the homeland. The remaining Londoners, under the deacon Nicholas Lee, tried to appoint their own minister, but were overruled by Francis Johnson, according to his brother George, fearing there would then be less incentive for people to come to Amsterdam. Other Separatist groups appeared in the city, and one contemporary menitoned 'the manifold curses which the Brownists remaining in London have oft laid upon one another'. By 1631, there were, according to the Bishop of Exeter, 'eleven several congregations (as they call them) of separatists about the city'. Ten years later, the Bishop of Norwich counted eighty in the London area, led by 'cobblers, tailors, felt-makers and suchlike trash'.

Early life  Glynn was born at Woodgreen Station (Atartinga), 150 km north of Alice Springs and is the daughter of Ron Price and Topsy Glynn, a housemaid and cook and she is the half-sister of Rona Glynn. In September 1939 Rona and Freda, were placed in The Bungalow, a \\"half-caste institution\\", at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station. Topsy worked as a laundress here in order to stay with her children. During World War II, Glynn, with her mother and sister were evacuated from Alice Springs to Melbourne following the bombing of Darwin and Katherine. Glynn, and her family, were returned to Alice Springs in 1949, when she was 10 years old, and they lived at St Mary's Hostel and attended Alice Springs High School until she was 17.  Career  After leaving school, in 1956, Glynn worked at Trish Collier's photographic studio in the darkroom; she was one of the first Aboriginal girls in Alice Springs to get a job other then as a domestic or cleaner. Freda has a number of other roles before she became involved in media but in 1977, after gaining a community development qualification from the South Australian Institute of Technology, she did take a job as a community development adviser for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. After a lot of consideration, in 1980 Glynn joined John Macumba and Philip Batty in volunteering to make \\"The Aboriginal Half Hour\\", the first Aboriginal radio program in the Northern Territory, where she began recording interviews around town, doing the program \\"links\\" and voice-overs as well as working on English language programming. Following this Glynn became an advocate for Aboriginal media and was appointed as a committee member of CAAMA when is was chartered on 12 May 1980; this again was a voluntary position. In June 1981 Macumba resigned as the director of CAAMA and was replaced by Glynn, then known by her married name Thornton, with Philip Batty as the deputy director; the two worked together from 1981 - 1991. During this period CAAMA grew exponentially and they established: * 8KIN-FM, the first Aboriginal radio station in Australia * CAAMA Productions, a film and video production house * CAAMA Shop Pty. Ltd, retail outlets * Imparja Television, commercial television service Imparja Television drew a lot of complaints from media activists about its lack of Aboriginal programs and the fact that only 10% of its staff were Aboriginal. Following this, Glynn and Batty, were drawn in direct confrontation with not only the management board of Imparja but also their governing committee and, finding their positions untenable, they both resigned in 1991. Following her time at CAAMA Glynn has continued to work in media and in 2002 she played Grandma Nina in the short film Shit Skin and, again in 2002, she received the Award for Contribution to Indigenous Media at the Third Tudawali Indigenous Film and Video Awards.  Legacy  Glynn is the matriarch of a film making family and two of her children, Erica Glynn and Warwick Thornton are both successful film makers. Her granddaughter, Tanith Glynn-Maloney, is also a film maker. In 2019 Erica Glynn released her film, She Who Must Be Loved, about her mother; she was assisted by her daughter Tanith.

The castle was mentioned in a diploma of Charles the Bald in 852. In the 15th century, it was rased, with its simple rectangular keep, as a sign of infamy, by order of King Charles VII. Marguerite de Rohan, Countess of Angoul√™me (wife of John, Count of Angoul√™me), rebuilt the castle, of which parts still remain including the Romanesque-style keep.

The church has previously been known as \\"The American Church\\" (and informally as \\"The American Chapel\\"), but this designation was abandoned in 1977 in the light of a decreasing American participation in the congregation. In December 1924 the church was established as a charitable foundation under Swiss law: La Fondation de la Chappelle d'Emmanuel.  Early history  In 1872 a multi-denominational group of Americans requested support from the Episcopal Church of the USA to found a church in Geneva. This was denied and the group independently founded a \\"Union\\" church that year. In 1873 the Episcopal Church did send Rev. William Chauncy Langdon DD to found a church in Geneva. The first service of the new church was held in the Temple de la Fusterie on 28 July 1873, and in August Bishop William Croswell Doane presided at a meeting where the church received the name \\"Emmanuel\\" and a Vestry was elected. A period of friction between the two churches came to an end when they were merged in June 1875. The merger agreement included the provision \\" . . the combined church . . could drop the Emmanuel name\\". Press reports at the times of the opening and consecration of the building (1878) refer most frequently to \\"the American Episcopal Church\\".  Building  Memorial of the Construction and Consecration of the church In 1876 The Emmanuel Chapel Company was formed for the construction of a church; MM Barbey, Bates, Delavin, Collins and Marcelin being the administrators. The foundation stone of the building was laid on 27 July 1877 by former American President Ulysses S. Grant on land donated by Henry I. Barbey, on what was then the Rue des Voirons. The first service took place in the church on Easter Sunday, 21 April 1878, in the presence of the American Consul and Vice-Consul. The building was consecrated on 24 August 1878 by Bishop Littlejohn of Long Island. The church building stands on land reclaimed from the lake in the early 18th century. It lies on a roughly South-West to North-East axis, due to the constraints of its surroundings. An extension, the Parish House, was designed by Edmond Fatio (biography in French Edmond Fatio) and opened in November 1930. It contains the Parish Halls, offices and the Library in English (formerly the \\"American Library\\"). In 1976 the Parish House suffered damage from subsidence caused by the excavation for a new hotel nearby. The current organ, by Hans F√ºglister, was dedicated on 23 June 1991.  Windows  The first of the windows was ordered from London and installed in May 1882. The windows are subject to a preservation order. The window above the altar (the \\"East\\" window) was originally illuminated by natural light, but the construction of the Parish House required it to be lit from behind with artificial light. It is exceptional in that it depicts both Christ in Glory and Jesus as a baby; a window in Genoa is the only other known in Europe. The stained glass in the Parish Hall (petite salle) is by R.

No exceptions\\". The church serves the \\"Greater Geneva Area\\", which includes the Canton of Geneva, near-by parts of the Canton of Vaud and neighbouring France. The 2016 Parish Survey indicated that 45% of parishioners come from the United States and 61% consider English to be their native tongue. However over 20 different languages are spoken, and 57% of parishioners described themselves as fluent in three or more. French is spoken by 87% of the community. The diversity of religious backgrounds includes Episcopalian 24%, Roman Catholic 20%, with a mixture of other Anglican and Protestant traditions contributing 45%. In 1973 Philip Potter Secretary General of the World Council of Churches wrote \\"Emmanuel Church has its place in history as a pioneer of the ecumenical movement\\". Church services are conducted predominantly in English, with a few bilingual English/French services each year, often with the Old Catholic congregation of St Germain (description in French St Germain). Sunday services take place at 8:30 (Holy Eucharist) and at 10:30 with music (Holy Eucharist or Morning Prayer). The size of the congregation, being composed mainly of expatriates, has varied greatly over the years with changes in the political and economic climate. The church almost ceased to function during the periods of the two World Wars, but had a total Sunday congregation of over 300 in 1960. In response to the Covid-19 epidemic, the building was closed to the public from 16 March to 13 June 2020. Congregations are no longer limited in size by Federal regulations; seating in the church is well-spaced, following the 2m social distancing recommendation. Services are also available \\"virtually\\" (for details see the website). The monthly ministry to those in need at \\"Jardin de Montbrillant\\", the local Soup kitchen, was suspended in March 2020. Personalities Henry I. Barbey (1832‚Äì1906), husband of Mary Lorillard Barbey, was originally a member of the \\"Union\\" Church and then a member of the Emmanuel Vestry for 31 years. He donated the land for the construction of the church building, and partially financed its construction and running during the early years. A window on the \\"North\\" side (N2) is dedicated to him. He was the uncle of Edmond Fatio, architect of the Parish House. James T. Bates, creator of the daily newspaper Tribune de Gen√®ve, was a founding member of the church and a member of the Vestry for 38 years. A window on the \\"North\\" side (N5) is dedicated to him. Rev. William Chauncy Langdon, the first rector, and George Washington Holland (commemorated in the \\"South\\" side window, S1) were two of the co-founders of the YMCA. Rev. Canon Nicolas T.

He is a male Belgian Malinois and was named after Conan O'Brien due to his shaggy hair. Conan took part in the Barisha raid in Syria, which resulted in the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then-leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, ISIS) terror organization, on October 27, 2019. He chased Baghdadi down into a tunnel where the terror leader detonated his suicide vest. General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. stated on October 30 that the dog was injured during the raid due to exposed live electric wires, but had recovered and returned to field duty. There is growing support for Conan to be awarded the Purple Heart following his injury. This would require the president to reverse a policy on military canines not being awarded military honors.  Identity  President Donald Trump posted the declassified picture of Conan on Twitter and called him a \\"wonderful dog\\" in the tweet. His name was classified at the time, but it was revealed as Conan to Newsweek. A few days later, Trump also referred to the dog as Conan. Trump later re-tweeted a meme from The Daily Wire of himself awarding a bronze paw print ‚ÄúMedal of Pawner‚Äù on a two-dimensional blue ribbon (a reference to the Medal of Honor) to Conan. After quickly garnering mainstream attention following the raid, merchandising with Conan's depiction and the slogan \\"Zero Bark Thirty\\" appeared online, a reference to Zero Dark Thirty, a film about the 2011 special operations raid targeting Osama bin Laden. = Conan's sex = There were conflicting reports on Conan's sex following his reveal to the public. Newsweek initially reported that the dog is female, but the magazine later issued a correction which said Conan is male. RTL Nieuws reported that Conan was trained by a company in Best, Netherlands before being transported to the United States, and a man identified as his former owner and trainer was quoted as saying: \\"It is a five year old male. It is a very good dog.\\" On November 25, 2019, a White House official said the dog is female before issuing a correction, saying Conan is in fact male. The next day, defense officials confirmed with Stars and Stripes that Conan was male. At the same time, a U.S. defense official disputed this and told ABC News that Conan is female, but ABC's report was retracted a short time later with multiple officials saying they had verified that Conan is male. The United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has contested a Freedom of Information Act request for records related to Conan's sex. SOCOM states that it can \\"neither confirm nor deny the existence or non existence of records,\\" but if records exist, they would be a national security secret.  White House visit  Conan is introduced in the White House Rose Garden, November 25, 2019 On November 25, 2019, Conan made a surprise appearance with a handler at the White House. The handler used dog commands in German during the meeting. President Donald Trump introduced Conan to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, saying, \\"So this is Conan. Right now, probably the world's most famous dog,\\" going on to call him a \\"tough cookie\\" and \\"actually incredible\\" and \\"The Ultimate drug sniffer\\" and \\"Ultimate fighter\\". First Lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attended the event as well, with Pence petting Conan and calling him a \\"hero\\" during brief remarks. President Trump stated that along with honoring Conan with a medal and a plaque, he met with some of the other special operations soldiers that participated in the Baghdadi raid, who were not identified for national security reasons as they were engaged in active duty.

The only other station on the line was at Haywood, standing two miles from Auchengray on a double track section of the line. Apart from the collieries this was a mainly farming district at the times of the railway's construction. History The Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway in 1845 showing the location of Wilsontown Iron Works. The station opened as the terminus of the passenger line at Wilsontown in 1870 and was then closed to passengers in 1951 but freight traffic continued until closure in 1964. The nearby Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway may have suggested a physical connection with Wilsontown but it never reached this destination. Wilsontown was first established as the site of the famous Wilsontown Ironworks however these closed in 1842 and the 1870 line was built across part of the site on an embankment. Services In May 1948 the passenger services consisted of around seven return trains a day on weekdays and altered timings on Saturdays for many services such as 11.25pm departure. No trains ran on a Sunday. One train did not run on school holidays. Connections to Carnwath, Carstairs, Edinburgh and Glasgow.Scottish Region Timetables. May 1948 In 1869 the line was extended to the Climpy Colliery as a freight line. Wilsontown Colliery Pit No.3 with its coke ovens was also served by the railway as was Wilsontown Colliery No.9. Station infrastructure Trackbed looking towards the station. The station had only a single curved wooden platform with lighting and a small wooden shelter on the south side of the passing loop with its ubiquitous station clock that served as a ticket office and waiting room with a coal fire. The signalbox lay to the east of the platform and was opened in 1893 and closed in 1963. A large goods shed with two sidings, a crane and a loading dock lay to the south of the station platform with a goods yard.Lanarkshire XX.1 (Carnwath; Carstairs). Publication date:1897 Revised:1896 The platform and goods yard were accessed off the nearby road to Carnwath. A weighing machine was located on the mineral line. A bridge crossed the road on its way to the Climpy Colliery. Remains of the station The track was lifted and the bridge towards Climpy removed. The station site was used as a storage depot and nothing remains of the station buildings. The embankment towards Haywood is extant as are the bridge abutments. Part of the trackbed is in use as footpaths related to the old Wilsontown Ironworks site and its visitor interpretation as a tourist attraction.

Biography  Born in Madrid on 25 May 1893, his family came from Elgoibar (Gipuzkoa). he earned a degree as architect from the School of Architecture of Madrid in 1916, where he happened to meet other future noted architects such as Secundino Zuazo, Leopoldo Torres Balb√°s or Luis Guti√©rrez Soto. An enthusiast of the practice of sports, he got to play as goalkeeper for Atl√©tico de Madrid. He gained him a reputation as exceptional draughtsman since his spell as student at the School of Architecture. In 1917, soon after graduating, Muguruza started to work as lecturer at the School of Architecture thanks to a proposal by Ricardo Vel√°zquez Bosco, and, in March 1920, he finally obtained a Chair of \\"Projects of Architectural and Ornamental Details\\". He married Mercedes Peironcely y Puig de la Bellacasa in 1921. They had no issue. Among the projects he authored in the 1920s: the France Station in Barcelona (1923), the Palacio de la Prensa in the Gran V√≠a (1925), the 40-metre high monument to the sacred Heart of Jesus in Bilbao (topped by a sculpture of Lorenzo Coullaut Valera) or the housing project for the Plaza de Rub√©n Dar√≠o (1929). He also led the projects for the restoration of the Monastery of El Paular and the Prado Museum. During the Second Republic he authored some markets, such as Santa Mar√≠a de la Cabezas's (1933) or Maravillas (1935). After the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, Muguruza fled from the Republican area and joined the Francoist side. Franco entrusted him the task or reorganizing the architecture in the territory controlled by the rebels. Muguruza assumed as member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1938. In June 1939, only 3 months after the Francoist victory in the war, he presided over the Assembly of architects in Madrid, setting the ideological foundations behind the architecture of the new regime. Already Chief of the Services of Architecture of FET y de las JONS, he was appointed to the leadership of the Directorate General for Architecture, structured along totalitarian lines. Muguruza served in the post from 30 September 1939 to 8 March 1946. Muguruza also was, along his disciple Diego M√©ndez, one of the two architects who authored the Valle de los Ca√≠dos; the aim behind the design was for the site to become an eternal metaphor of the regime's ideology. He directed the building works until his leaving in 1949, reportedly because of a degenerative paralysis; he was replaced by M√©ndez. He died on 3 February 1952 in Madrid.

Impekoven was questioned about her relations with W√∂lffler, but was left alone after a Gestapo officer recognised that her daughter was a famous dancer. W√∂lffler however was later deported to Theresienstadt. Another time she offered her apartment to another Jewish woman, Margarete Knewitz.

St. Olavsleden was one of the Pilgrim's Routes. From the 1970s until 2012, it was called the Mittnordenleden. Today St. Olavsleden stretches 564 km from the Bothnian sea in the east to the Atlantic ocean in the west through two countries and eleven municipalities. The trail is marked with the St. Olav symbol, which marks all the so-called St. Olav roads (Sw.: S:t Olavsv√§gar), leading towards Nidaros Cathedral. St. Olavsleden passes through the ancient cultural landscape, following as closely as possible the roads and paths that pilgrims of that time and other travelers wandered and rode. The first hundred kilometers the trail mostly follows Ljungan river, and in J√§mtland the trail goes along the lakes Revsundssj√∂n and Storsj√∂n, and eventually Indals√§lven river. St. Olavsleden crosses the Scandinavian mountains on the border between Sweden and Norway along Swedish county road 322 (Skalstuguv√§gen) and in Norway goes through the agricultural landscape near the Trondheim fjord. St. Olavsleden is moderately hilly which makes it suitable for cycling.  History  Today's knowledge of St. Olaf comes mainly from the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, dead in 1241, who wrote a large number of royal sagas in his Heimskringla, one of which tells about King Olaf. In 995, Olaf Haraldsson (√ìl√°fr Haraldsson) was born in Ringerike in southern Norway. At the age of 12 he set out on a Viking voyage and it took many years before he returned to Norwegian soil. Olaf eventually became a skilled and experienced Viking with long trips in the Baltic sea and all the way down to Spain. On October 16, 1013, Olaf was baptized in French Rouen, and his significance for the Christian Church began with this baptism. In 1015 Olaf stood again on Norwegian ground and aimed to unite Norway with himself as a king and to introduce Christianity in Norway. As part of this, he tried to build an alliance with the Swedish king Olof Sk√∂tkonung, which among other things led to a marriage with Olof's daughter Astrid. In 1020 Olaf Haraldsson was the king of a united Norway, and in 1024 a new legislation was introduced which was based on the Canon law. This legislation had a profound effect on Norwegian society through its ambition to change old local traditions. This led to increased dissatisfaction with Olaf. The resistance grew, and Olaf was forced to leave the country in 1028 and make his way to Novgorod, where his sister-in-law Ingegerd lived, married to Tsar Yaroslav. Olaf stayed in Novgorod for almost two years, before deciding to return to Norway and reclaim the crown. According to the legend recorded in the 1680s,Leif Grundberg (2006). \\"Medeltid i centrum: europeisering, historieskrivning och kulturarvsbruk i norrl√§ndska kulturmilj√∂er\\" (doktorsavhandling, Ume√• universitet) sid 43‚Äì44 (in Swedish) at the beginning of July 1030 after a few years of exile, Olaf came ashore in the parish of Sel√•nger in Sundsvall. This harbor was first mentioned in a written source from the 1530s, and in the 17th century it was called King's Harbor or Sel√•nger's Harbor. King Olaf supposedly erected a copper-clad cross in the harbor which should still have remained there forty years before the story was written down. He went to Norway with his army to Christianize the country and take back the king's throne. The trip ended in Stiklestad, where Olaf was killed during the Battle of Stiklestad on July 29th. Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to spread about Olaf's holiness- Olav den hellige. A little over a year later - on August 3, 1031 - the body was excavated in the presence of Bishop Grimketel. The bishop canonized Olaf, and his remains were moved to St. Clement's church in Nidaros. The construction of the Nidaros Cathedral, a burial church for St. Olaf, began 1070. It was founded on the place where his remains were buried in the ground after the battle in Stiklestad. The burial site started to attract pilgrims from all over Europe.  Sel√•nger  Sel√•nger was the starting point for the most important transport route between Norway and Sweden during the Middle Ages and according to Swedish historian Nils Ahnlund (1889‚Äì1957) it might have been used during the Viking era. Hardware trading in the north-south direction is believed to have taken place in Sel√•nger's shipping port (at an easily accessible land connection between the sea and river Ljungan), as early as the 6th century, resulting in a wealth revealed in finds made in the H√∂gom chamber grave (H√∂goms gravf√§lt) in Sel√•nger parish. Sel√•nger church ruins are located near the harbor.  Pilgrim's way  Nidaros and its Cathedral became one of the most important pilgrimage destinations of the Christian world in parity with Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela. A large number of pilgrims from all over the Christian world visited Nidaros Cathedral annually. In connection with the Reformation, however, the number of pilgrims decreased, and in Sweden pilgrimage was banned in 1544. However, the memory of Olaf's march from Sel√•nger to Trondheim remained alive. Along the trail there are many St. Olaf's springs, and in several churches there are medieval sculptures depicting St. Olaf. √Öre Old Church (√Öre gamla kyrka) became one of these central meeting places which holds a wooden sculpture of Olaf from the 1300s but with a Carolean wooden tricorn hat from 1719 instead of the lost crown. In many towns and villages there are street names, connected to St. Olaf and to pilgrimage, including Pilgrim's road (Pilgrimsv√§gen). In the western part of Br√§cke municipality in the region of J√§mtland there is the community of Pilgrimstad. Over the years, there have been made efforts on the local level to preserve parts of the trail. Prior to the 1000th anniversary of Trondheim in 1997, the Diocese of H√§rn√∂sand took the initiative to revive interest in St. Olavsleden. Sundsvall, √ñstersund and Trondheim have had a collaboration since 1999, working together and making investments to popularize hiking tourism. The partnership between the County Administrative Board of J√§mtland and Olav's Festival (Olavsfestdagene) in Trondheim had the same goal.  The hiking trail today  On September 7, 2013 St. Olav's path was re-opened with hikes and a service in Nidaros Cathedral. The route has been recreated as follows: Sel√•nger - Tuna - St√∂de - Torp - Borgsj√∂ - J√§mtkrogen - Br√§cke - G√§ll√∂ - Revsund - Pilgrimstad - Brunflo - √ñstersund - Fr√∂s√∂n - Alsen - Mattmar - J√§rpen - Unders√•ker - √Öre - Medstugan - Skalstugan - Sul - Stiklestad ‚Äì Stj√∏rdal - Trondheim.

Life cycle =Larva= right right Larvae feed from August to June, initially in a whitish mine in the frond, and in the spring they leave the mine and burrow into a sorus, feeding on the sporangia. They later form a loose, portable case from empty sporangia and when fully grown in May the case resembles a misplaced sorus, especially on hart's-tongue fern (Asplenium scolopendrium). The larva is yellowish white with a brownish dorsa line and has a black head and black prothoracic plate. The following ferns have been recorded as food plants, * rustyback (Asplenium ceterach) * wall-rue (Asplenium ruta-muraria) * hart's-tongue fern (Asplenium scolopendrium) * maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes) * bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) Larva of another moth, Psychoides filicivora also feed on ferns.

In the , Goondi Hill had a population of 510 people.  Geography  Goondi Hill is bounded by Bamboo Creek and North Bamboo Creek to the south and south-west. The land is flat, mostly below above sea level. Immediately west of Innisfail, it has some residential overflow from Innisfail including a retirement village in the north of the locality. In the south of the locality the land use is predominantly agricultural, mostly growing sugarcane. Most of the locality contains various civic amenities, such as the race course, the golf course and the showground. The Bruce Highway enters the locality from the east (along Edith Street, Innisfail) and exits to the west (along Palmerston Drive, Goondi Bend). The North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south (Mighell) and exits the locality to the north-west (Goondi Bend / Cullinane) with Innisfail railway station within the locality ().  History  The name Goondi is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning elbow, referring to the bend in the South Johnstone River. In June 1912 there was a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Johnstone River Agricultural Association with the intention to hold their first agricultural show that same year. The first show was held on Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October 1912 in recreation ground (now Callender Park) with exhibits in the Shire Hall and the Oddfellows Hall. In 1935 the show needed more space and the present showgrounds were established with purpose-built buildings and a show ring. The show was held annually apart from 1942 and 1942 when, due to World War II, the army was using the showground. In 1986 many of the showgound's buildings were badly damaged by Cyclone Winifred with further damage sustained during Cyclone Larry in 2006. In 2002 the show introduced a banana packing competition which was very popular. In the , Goondi Hill had a population of 510 people.  Education  There are no schools in Goondi Hill.

The first generation of CLS63 was introduced in 2006 as a successor to Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG. From 2006 to 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced two generations of CLS63, as well as one facelift for each generation. A shooting-brake model was also introduced in 2012. Mercedes-Benz replaced CLS63 AMG with CLS53 AMG in 2019.  Background  Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG was first introduced in 2006 as a successor to Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG, as CLS55 wasn't powerful enough for a 2006 car. CLS63's first generation design was derived from Mercedes-Benz Vision CLS, a concept car later resulted in the development of Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class W219.  First generation (2006‚Äì2008)  The first generation CLS63 was launched in 2006, as a four-door coup√© with advanced Mercedes-AMG technologies, such as AMG high-performance brake system and 7G-Tronic transmission. The 7G-Tronic transmission allows the driver to control the car in either an automatic or a manual way. CLS63 had a V8 petrol engine, with of torque and a top speed of . The first generation of CLS63 was able to reach in 4.5 seconds. Its curb weight was . The CLS63 had a double overhead camshaft and a fuel injection system. The 7G-Tronic transmission allows the driver to change the driving mode between \\"S\\" (Sport), \\"C\\" (Comfort) and \\"M\\" (Manual) modes. Sport mode is almost 30% faster than comfort and 50% faster than manual. To change the driving mode, the driver should press a button placed inside the car. A new suspension system developed by Mercedes-AMG was used in CLS63, caused an increase in the car's handling. The front axle had a 35 millimetres wider track, which decreased the dynamic wheel loads when cornering. This also caused the wheel arches to be wider. The CLS63 was equipped with alloy wheels, with the option of receiving alloy wheels. PRE- SAFE, a collision avoidance system, was included in the first generation of CLS63 as a standard equipment.

This 65-kilometre-long road is being developed by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). The reason for creating the PRR was to decongest the Outer Ring Road which currently acts as a by-pass to the city with more than 10,000 trucks using it. According to BDA's project report, with the immense growth in intra-city traffic, the ORR is under tremendous pressure already. The city has already extended beyond the ORR which is a key factor in the increasing pressure on ORR. In order to relieve the traffic pressure on the ORR and the major road networks of the city, a peripheral ring road (PRR) of 116 km was planned outside of the ORR. This stretch is planned to not only improve connectivity of areas beyond the ORR, but also ease the congestion on the ORR.

It is a grade I listed building. History The church was built in the 12th century and lavishly rebuilt in the 15th century, though it retains earlier parts, and the 15th- century painted glass surviving in some of the windows is a notable feature. The earliest known reference to a church in Bledington is in a confirmation dated 1175 by Pope Alexander III to Winchcombe Abbey of all its churches. The east and west walls of the nave are said to be from this era. The main rebuilding in the late 15th century included the raising of the nave roof, the insertion of a clerestory and parapets, and the refenestration of the nave and aisle. Most of the new windows were square-headed, with Perpendicular tracery, and five have canopied image brackets in each reveal. A recess with a three- light window was built leading from the south-west corner of the chancel into an archway to the south aisle. The 15th-century south doorway, with moulded arch and head stops, retains part of its early door. In 1548 Somerset, the Lord Protector, acting on behalf of the boy king Edward VI, ordered that all imagery should be removed from churches, and by 1650 St Leonards had lost its rood screen and window statues. The hidden remains of the earlier wall decorations are now partially visible, including a stretch of masonry pattern enriched with rosettes and heart-shaped petals dating from the 14th century on the west wall of the chancel and a late medieval figure, in black outline, of a crowned female saint with long hair on the east wall of the nave. The building was in a very poor state by the mid-19th century. It was restored in 1881 by J. E. K. Cutts and again by F.E. Howard c.1923. The pews were replaced in 1904, but some 15th-century bench ends with decorative blind tracery were retained. The ecclesiastical parish includes both Bledington and the hamlet of Foscot in Oxfordshire and forms part of the Evenlode Vale benefice of the Anglican Church, within the Diocese of Gloucester. The patronage remains with the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. Architecture The building is of stone, with roofs of lead and of Cotswold stone, and comprises a chancel with a sanctus bell-cot, clerestoried nave, south aisle, south porch, and embattled west tower. The chancel, the nave arcade of three bays, and the south porch were built in the 13th century, and some new windows were added in the 14th century. Subsequently, a three-stage tower with an external vice was erected: the west wall of the nave serves as the base of the west wall of the tower and arches within the nave support the other walls of the tower. There are five 17th-century bells and a sixth dated 1811. One bell cast in 1639 bears the inscription We are the bells of Bledington and Charles is our King. The eight windows of the north wall of the nave and the recessed window in the south wall of the chancel were filled with contemporary painted glass. The glass survives, in some cases as fragments pieced together, but in others as nearly complete panels. It has been suggested that it was made by John Prudde of Westminster, glazier of the similar windows in the Beauchamp chapel in Warwick. Some of the inscriptions and names of donors can still be seen, one dated 1470. The tub-shaped font is 12th-century, the communion rails and altar table are 17th-century, and beside the 20th-century pulpit is an ancient wrought-iron hourglass stand. In the churchyard is a war memorial to soldiers from the village.

It was located in Aprelevka, Moscow Oblast. History The factory was founded in 1910. In the first year of operation (1911), 400,000 vinyl discs under the brand name Metropol Record were released. After the 1917 October Revolution, the plant was nationalized and began producing records with performances by Russian revolutionaries. In 1925, the plant was renamed to \\"Aprelevka Plant in the name of Memory of Year 1905\\" (Russian: –ê–ø—Ä–µ–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥ –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–∏ 1905 –≥–æ–¥–∞). In the early 1930s, the plant became the main producer of phonograph records in the USSR. The plant was expanded, it employed more than 1000 workers, and the annual release reached 19 million records. In the early days of World War II, the ‚ÄúHoly War‚Äù performed by the Alexandrov ensemble was first recorded at the plant. During the war, the plant produced aerial bombs. After the war, in 1952, the factory mastered the production of long-playing records. And in 1961, the production of the first stereo records began. In 1964, the Aprelevka Plant became part of the All-Union record company ‚ÄúMelodiya‚Äù as the main production enterprise, which subsequently produced up to 65% of all Soviet records. By the early 1980s, the plant employed more than 3,000 people, and the release of records exceeded 50 million pieces per year. In 1989, the factory began production of audio cassettes. After 1991, the structure of ‚ÄúMelodiya‚Äù (primarily the centralized system of orders and sales) began to fall apart, and the record plants included in it received unexpected and, as it turned out, burdensome freedom. Demand for vinyl records began to decline sharply: the purchasing power of the population fell, the production of turntables decreased, and new optical audio format, CD, entered the market. In 1991, when the Aprelevka Plant released about 33 million records, it was already operating at a loss, since the prices of the records remained fixed. Neither the transition to independent customers (SNC Records, Moroz Records and other record companies), nor the release of cassettes with recordings helped. In 1992, the plant was on the verge of stopping with an annual output of about 10 million pieces. The last batch of records and cassettes was released in 1997. In 2002, the decision of the Moscow Region Arbitration Court, the Aprelevka gramophone record plant was declared bankrupt. The president of the Russian independent label Lilith Records, Olga Kiryanova, said that the Aprelevka vinyl record factory will start working again in the spring of 2009, but these plans were not destined to come true. –í–æ–∑—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–∏–Ω–∏–ª–∞ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ (–ê–ø—Ä–µ–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥). –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≤–∏–Ω–∏–ª–∞ –≤ –°–°–°–†.

Its splendor was between the 12th to 14th centuries, in which two important Torah centers flourished in Barcelona and Girona. The Catalan Jewish community developed unique characteristics, which included customs, a prayer rite (Nusach Catalonia),According to Rabbi Yitzhaq Luria Ashkenazi (Arizal), nusach Catalonia is one of the 12 existing nusachim that correspond to the 12 tribes of Israel (Rabbi Chayim Vital, Sefer Shaar ha-Kavanot, nusach ha-tefillah, the secret of the 12 doors). Regarding the different traditions and customs, the Arizal divides the people of Israel into four major families: Sepharad, Ashkenaz, Catalonia and Italy (Sheneh Luchot ha-Berit, Torah she-bikhtav, Bemidbar). and a tradition of its own in issuing legal decisions (Halakhah).Rabbi Shimon ben Tzemach Duran (Rashbatz) mentions on several occasions that in Catalonia tradition was ruled according to the opinions of Rabbi Shelomoh ben Adret (Rashba) while in Sepharad was ruled according to the opinions of Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh), Rabbi Yaaqov ben Asher (Baal ha-Turim) and Rabbi Moshe ben Maymon (Rambam): ¬´In Catalonia the halachic decisions are followed according to Rashba, while in Sepharad are followed according to Baal ha-Turim and Rambam¬ª (reference: Tashbetz, vol 3, 257, see also: Tashbetz vol 2, 141, vol 3, 86, vol 3, 118, vol 4, column 3, 10). Although the Jews of Catalonia had a ritual of prayerRecently, has been published the Sidur Catalunya, which constitutes the first reconstruction of the old nusach Catalonia. The siddur is based on six medieval Hebrew manuscripts (from the 14th to the 16th century) and also includes a series of commentaries, laws and customs that were compiled by a disciple of Rabbi Yona Girondi at the Talmudic academy of Barcelona. and different traditions from those of SepharadIn the halakhic and Responsa literature of the Rishonim, a clear distinction between Sepharad and Catalonia is made, both in terms of customs as regards the rites of prayer. See: Responsa of Rabbi Avraham ben David (Raabad) 131, Responsa of Rabbi Shelomoh ben Adret (Rashba) new 345, Responsa of Rabbi Yitzchaq bar Sheshet (Ribash), 79, 369.

Following the riots of 1391 and the expulsion of 1492, Jews who did not convert to Christianity were forced to emigrate to Italy, the Ottoman Empire, North Africa and the Land of Israel.  Early History  Historians affirm that Jews arrived at the Iberian Peninsula before the destruction of the Second Temple, although as regards archaeological remains, the oldest burial gravestones that have been found which testify to the existence of Jewish communities date from the third century. The term Aspamia derives from the name Hispania and refers to the Iberian Peninsula in Roman times.Third century BCE - 5th century CE. At the beginning of the 5th century, the Roman domination of the peninsula fell to the Visigoths. During the Visigoth period, numerous decrees were issued against the Jews and sometimes they were forced to convert to Christianity or be expelled. In 711 CE, Muslims began conquering the Iberian Peninsula. The conquered areas that were under the rule of Islam were called al-Andalus (in Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿØŸÑÿ≥). We do not know much about the history of the Jews at the beginning of Islamic rule, but we are aware that the Jews began to use the term SepharadThe name Sepharad appears for the first time in the book of Obadiah 1:20: ¬´And this exiled host of the children of Israel who are [with] the Canaanites as far as Zarephath and the exile of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad shall inherit the cities of the southland¬ª. Rashi was based on the Targum Yonathan, which translated the name Sepharad by the term Aspamia: ¬´Sepharad, translated Yonathan: Aspamia¬ª. to refer to these lands.From the letter of Rabbi Chasday ibn Shaprut to the King of the Kuzarim, we can deduce that the name Sepharad referred to the lands that were under the rule of Islam, that is, al-Andalus: ¬´Know your majesty the King, that the name of our land in which we live, in the sacred language is Sepharad and in the language of the Ishmaelites (Arabs) that inhabit it is al-Andalus, and the name of its capital is Cordoba¬ª. The letter was written by Rabbi Yehudah ha-Levi, and therefore, the sentence only reflects the time of the author. In a process of territorial reoccupation called Reconquista, the Christian kingdoms progressively conquered all Islamic territories, from north to south. With the Christian Reconquista, the territories occupied by the kingdoms of Castile and Portugal were also called by the Jews Sepharad, while Catalonia and the other kingdoms of the north were called Edom or named after Esau.So, Rabbi Moshe ben Maymon (Maimonides) writes in his book Mishneh Torah: ¬´Synagogues and study houses must be treated with respect and must be sprinkled (cleaned up). In Sepharad and in the West (Morocco), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to light the candles in the synagogues and extend the blinds on the floor on which the parishioners sit. In the lands of Edom (Christian lands) in the synagogues people sit on chairs [or benches]¬ª. (Hilkhot Tefillah, 11, 5). The reconquest of Catalonia began under the auspices of the Frankish kings, who forced the Muslims who had managed to cross the Pyrenees at the Battle of Poitiers in 732 to retreat to the south. All the lands freed from the Islamic domain became counties and remained under the administrative organization of the Franks. The Catalan counties, led by the counts of Barcelona, slowly broke free from the Franks and began to govern themselves independently. Old Catalonia became a zone of containment (Marca Hispanica) against the spread of Islam. Jews often moved from Sepharad (the Muslim zone) to the northern lands (the Christian kingdoms), and vice versa. The fact that many of them spoke Arabic and also the vernacular Romance languages helped them to serve as translators and acquire important positions in both Muslim and Christian governments. Jews owned fields and vineyards and many of them devoted themselves to agriculture. In this early period, the Jewish scholars of Catalonia who sought advanced Talmudic studies used to go to study in the Talmudic academies (yeshivot) in the South. Also, those who wanted to study science or linguistics went to Sepharad, as did Rabbi Menachem ben Saruq (920-970), who was born in the Catalan city of Tortosa and moved with all his family to Cordoba to study and to devote himself to the Hebrew language under the patronage of Governor Shemuel ibn Nagrella. The first evidence of an important Jewish settlement in Barcelona and Girona are from the 9th century CE. We know that in the 11th and 12th centuries in Barcelona there was a rabbinical court (Bet Din) and an important teaching center of the Torah. In this period, Barcelona became a link in the chain of transmission of the teachings of the GeonimThe period of the Gueonim dates from the end of the 6th century to the middle of the 11th century.. Important Catalonian Rabbis from this time are Rabbi Yitzchaq ben Reuven al-Bargeloni (1043 -?), Rabbi Yehudah ben Barzilay ha-Barceloni, called Yehudah ha-Nasi of Barcelona (late 11th century, beginning of the 12th century) and Rabbi Avraham bar Chiyya NasiBarcelona was well-known like the city of the nesiim (patriarchs), due to the great amount of personalities that enjoyed this honorific title. (late 11th century, first half of the 12th century). We know that two of the great chachamim of Provence, Rabbi Yitzchaq ben Abba Mari (1122-1193) and Rabbi Avraham ben Rabbi Yitzchaq (1110-1179), moved to Barcelona. Catalonia joined Provence in 1112 and Aragon in 1137, and thus the County of Barcelona became the capital of the unified realm called the Crown of Aragon. The kings of the Crown of Aragon extended their domains to the Occitan countries.  12th and 13th centuries  Seal attributed to Nachmanides [Copy from the Museum of History of the Jews in Girona] In the 12th and 13th centuries the Catalonian Talmudic academies thrived. The great Rabbis and kabbalists Ezra and Azriel bene Shelomoh (late 12th century, beginning of the 13th century) disciples of the famous Rabbi Yitzchaq el Cec (the Blind) (1160-1235), son of Rabbi Avraham ben David (Raabad) of Posqui√®res (1120-1198), stood out in the city of Girona. We can also include Rabbi Yaaqov ben Sheshet (12th century) among the Girona kabbalists of this period. Also, from Girona was Rabbi Avraham ben Yitzchaq he-Hazan (12th-13th centuries) author of the piyyutLiturgical poem. Achot qetanah (little sister). From the city of Girona was the greatest of Catalonian sages, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban, or Nachmanides) (1194-1270), whose Catalonian name was Bonastruc √ßa Porta. Although the city of Girona was an important center of Torah that had a Bet Midrash (House of Study) dedicated to the study of the Kabbalah, the main city was Barcelona, where the Ramban served as the head of the community. During this period, Rabbi Yona Girondi (1210-1263) and his famous disciples Rabbi Aharon ben Yosef ha-Levi of Barcelona (Reah) (1235-1303) and Rabbi Shelomoh ben Adret (Rashba) (1235-1310). Also, Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh) (1250-1327), his son Rabbi Yaaqov ben Asher (Baal ha-Turim) (1269-1343), and Rabbi Yom Tov ben Avraham ha-Sevilli (Ritba) 1250-1330), disciples of Rashba and Reah. We can say that at that time Barcelona became the most important Talmudic study center in all of the European Jewry. It was also during this time that certain Catalan Jewish families occupied key positions in the Catalonian economy, such as the Taro√ß family of Girona. alt= In Catalonia in the 13th century Jews were victims of blood libels and were forced to wear a distinctive sign called Rodella. The authorities prohibited Jews from performing public office and were forced to participate in public disputes with representatives of Christianity, such as the Barcelona Disputation of 1263 in which the Ramban participate as a representative of Judaism. The Jews were private property of the monarchy who charged them taxes in exchange for protection. The kings of the Crown of Aragon expanded the Catalan domains and conquered Mallorca, Valencia, Ibiza and Menorca. In 1258 they signed the Corbeil treaty with the French king for which they renounced to their rights over the Occitan lands. In return, the Franks resigned their demands on the Catalan lands.  14th century  synagogue in Girona (14th century). In the 14th century Christian fanaticism prevailed throughout the Iberian Peninsula and there were many persecutions against the Jews. We can mention among Catalonian sages of this period Rabbi Peretz ben Yitzchaq ha-Kohen (1304-1370) who was born in Provence but dwelled in Barcelona, Rabbi Nisim ben Reuven Girondi (Ran) (1315-1376) who served as a Rabbi in Barcelona, Rabbi Chasday ben Yehudah Cresques (the elder), Rabbi Yitzchaq bar Sheshet Perfet (Ribash) (1326-1408), Rabbi Chasday Cresques (Rachaq) (1340-1412), Rabbi Yitzchaq ben Moshe ha-Levi (Profiat Duran, ha-Ephody) (1350-1415), Rabbi Shimon ben Tzemach Duran (Rashbatz) (1361-1444). From this same period, we can include the cartographer of Mallorca Avraham Cresques (14th century) and the poet Shelomoh ben Meshullam de Piera (1310/50-1420/25). Rabbi Nisim ben Reuven Girondi (Ran) resumed the activity of the Barcelona Yeshivah in the 50s and 60s, after the Jewish community was heavily affected by the Black Death in 1348. In 1370, Jews of Barcelona were victims of attacks instigated by a blood libel; a few Jews were assassinated and the secretaries of the community were imprisoned in the synagogue for a few days without food. Following the succession of John I of Castile, conditions for Jews seem to have improved somewhat. With John I even making legal exemptions for some Jews, such as Abraham David Taro√ß. Seal for the Matsot (acetic breads) (14th century) [Copy from the History Museum of the Jews in Girona]. The end of the century brought the revolts of 1391. As a result of the riots, many Jews were forced to convert to Christianity and many others died as martyrs. Others succeeded in fleeing to North Africa (such as Ribash and Rashbatz), Italy and the Ottoman Empire. It was the end of the Jewish communities of Valencia and Barcelona. The community of Mallorca held out until 1435, when Jews were forced to convert to Christianity; the community of Girona barely endured until the expulsion of 1492. Rabbi Chasday Cresques, in a letter he sent to the Jewish community of Avignon, offers us an account about the riots of 1391.The letter was published in the book Shevet Yehudah, Rabbi Yehudah ibn Verga (edition of Hanover, 1924). In summary, we can conclude from his account that the riots began on the first day of the Hebrew month of Tammuz (Sunday, 4/6/1391) in Seville, Cordoba, Toledo and close to seventy other locations. From day seven of the month of Av (Sunday, 9/7/1391), they extended to other communities of the Crown of Aragon: Valencia, Barcelona, Lleida, Girona and Mallorca. During the 1391 attacks, the majority of the Jewish communities of Sepharad, Catalonia and Aragon were destroyed. During the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the kings of the Crown of Aragon expanded their territories to the lands of the Mediterranean; they conquered Sicily (1282), Corsica (1297-1516), Athens (1311), Neopatria (1318), Sardinia (1323-1326) and Naples (1435-1442).  15th century  The fifteenth century was very hard for Jewish life in the Iberian Peninsula. The communities that survived the 1391 riots faced great pressure on the part of the church and the Christian population. The kings, who were in a difficult economic situation, imposed heavy taxes on Jewish communities. The lives of the ‚ÄúConverso‚Äù Jews who converted to Christianity was not easy either, the church called them ‚Äúnew Christians‚Äù and they always kept them under suspicion, since many of them accepted Christianity only as an outward pretense but actually maintained Judaism in secret. The Inquisition persecuted and punished the new Christians who observed the commandments of Judaism. Catalonia hosted one of the longest disputes in the Middle Ages, the famous Dispute of Tortosa (1413-1414). In the 15th century, we find the poet Shelomoh ben Reuven Bonafed in Catalonia. In 1469 King Fernando of Aragon (1452-1516) and Queen Isabel of Castile (1451-1504) married and unified the two kingdoms. In 1492 they completed the reconquest with the defeat of the Kingdom of Granada and expelled Jews from all of their kingdoms.  The diaspora of the Jews of Catalonia  The first group of exiled Jews of Catalonia came out in the wake of the 1391 attacks, they went mainly to Italy (Sicily, Naples, Rome, Livorno), North Africa (Algeria) and the Ottoman Empire (mainly Salonica, Constantinople and the Land of Israel). The second group came into exile following the expulsion of the Catholic kings. The Edict was decreed on March 31, 1492, and time was given to Jews to sell their properties and leave until July 31, which, according to the Hebrew calendar, fell that year on the eve of the eight of the month Av, which means that the Jews were traveling on the ships expelled on 9th of Av. A large number of Jews converted to Christianity in order to remain in Catalonia. = Settlement in Italy = Many of the Catalonian Jews arrived in Italy and found refuge in Sicily, Naples, Livorno and the city of Rome.  Sicily  Aron ha-Qodesh (Torah Scrolls Ark) of the Catalonian Jewish community of Agira, Sicily (1453). We know that Jews from the Iberian Peninsula settled in Sicily since the 11th century.In some manuscripts preserved in the Cairo Genizah, we find Jews called the 'Sephardic' or the 'Andalusi'. See: Menahem ben Sassoon, Yehude Sicilia, teudot u-meqorot, Jerusalem: 1991 (in Hebrew). The famous Kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Abulafia (1240-1291), who studied many years in Catalonia, settled in Sicily, where he wrote most of his works.Moshe Idel, ¬´The Ecstatic Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia in Sicily and its Transmission during the Renaissance¬ª, Italia Judaica V: Atti del V Convegno internazionale (Palermo, 15-19 giugno 1992), Roma: Ministerio per i benni culturali e ambientali, pp. 330-340. Sicily had been part of the Catalan-Aragonese crown for many years and the Jewish communities remained on the island until the end of the 15th century, with the expulsion edict of the Jews of the island on June 18, 1492. We know of the existence of a Catalan Jewish community in the island thanks to the identification of a manuscriptIn Sidur Catalunya, the manuscript Parma Palatina 1750 is identified as nusach Catalonia. Before the reading of the Torah of Shabbat there appears the \\"blessing of the king\\" in which King Don Fadrique of Aragon is mentioned, surely it is King Fadrique III (1341-1377) who reigned in Sicily during 1355-1377. This manuscript represents the first document that refers to the Catalan Jewish community of Sicily, which as we can see already existed before the 1391 revolts. of the 14th century as siddur nusach Catalonia.Until today, it was supposed that the migratory wave of Catalan Jews in Sicily began as a result of the 1391 revolts. See: Nadia Zeldes, ¬´Els jueus i conversos catalans a Sic√≠lia: migraci√≥, relacions culturals i conflicte social¬ª, Roser Salicr√∫ i Lluch et. al.

In 2017, an old Aron ha-Qodesh (the sacred Ark of the synagogue where the Torah scrolls are stored) was rediscovered in the city of Agira.See: Ariela Piatelli, ¬´Gli ebrei catalani nella Sicilia del ‚Äô400. In un armadio di pietra la loro storia¬ª, La Stampa (13 setembre 2017). It was found in the church of Sancta Sanctorum Salvatore and commemorates the construction of the synagogue of the Catalan Jews in 1453, it is one of the oldest Aron ha-Qodesh in Europe.

In 1517 the Catalonian Jewish community of Rome was well organized and built a synagogue following the minhagTradition, custom.

In 1519 Pope Leo X (1475-1521) granted them a permit to widen the community and move the synagogue to a new location, allowed them to remodel and adapt it into a house of prayer according to their rites and customs. By the end of 1527, the Catalonian community and the Aragonese community decided to merge. The joint synagogue of Catalonia and Aragon changed its location again in 1549. In 1555, the community approved the expenses for the construction of another synagogue. The Catalan-Aragonese community fought to avoid merging with the Sephardic communities. All other communities from the Iberian Peninsula merged into a single united Iberian community in Rome, except for the Catalonians who joined the Aragonese. With the establishment of the ghetto in 1555, the Catalonian community maintained its own separate synagogue. In a census of 1868, it can be observed that of the total of 4995 Jews in Rome, 838 belonged to the community of Catalonia. In 1904 the Catalan synagogue ended up joining the other synagogues of Rome to form a single synagogue that was constructed on the banks of the Tiber River. Since then we have no information about the Catalonian community. = Settlement in the Ottoman Empire = The exiled Jews of Catalonia also migrated to the Ottoman Empire where they were organized in communities according to the place of origin that were called Qehalim.They were organized in seven Qehalim called: Catalan, Aragon, Castilla, Lisbon, Guerush Sepharad, Mallorca and Sicily. There were Catalonian Qehalim in Istanbul, Edirne, Salonica and Safed, among others.The censuses were published in: Simon Schwarzfuchs, ¬´La Catalogne et l'invention de Sepharad¬ª, Actes del I Congr√©s per a l'estudi dels jueus en territori de llengua catalana: Barcelona-Girona, del 15 al 17 d'octubre de 2001, Barcelona: Publicacions i Edicions de la Universitat de Barcelona, 2004, pp. 185-208.  The Catalonian Jewish Community of Salonica  The Jews of Catalonia formed a community in Salonica that was called ‚ÄúCatalan‚Äù.The cemetery of the Jewish community of Salonica was established in the 16th century and was destroyed in 1943. Nowadays, the University of Salonica is in the same place. Although the tombstones were destroyed some local researchers transcribed the inscriptions, so the text of the funeral tombstones of the Catalan community has been preserved. Despite being a minority, the Catalonian Jews fought to avoid merging with the Sephardic communities and maintained their ancient customs. The religious leaders of the holy communities of Catalonia in Salonica received the title of Marbitz TorahTorah teacher, religious community leader. and not the title Rabbi. The first known was Eliezer ha-Shimoni, who arrived in Salonica in 1492. He had a great influence on all the communities of Salonica and was one of the first to sign the agreements (Haskamot) of the sages. Later we find Moshe Capsali. The chacham Yehudah ben Benveniste, also arrived after the expulsion and established a very important library. Another chacham from the Catalonian Jewish community was Rabbi Moshe Almosnino, Marbitz Torah, exegete and philosopher, son of Barukh Almosnino, who had rebuilt the Catalonian synagogue after the fire of 1545.In the Responsa of Rabbi Samuel de Medina, he ruled in favor of Moshe Almosnino in order to build a Synagogue of the holy community of Catalonia. In 1515, the community was divided into two Qehalim that were called Catalan yashan (Old Catalan) and Catalan chadash (New Catalan).We find witnesses of this division in the Responsa of Rabbi David Ben Zimra (Radbaz), first part, 292. Machzor according to the rite of Barcelona and the custom of Catalonia. Salonica, 1527.National Library of Israel R 52 A 347. In 1526, the machzor of Yamim Noraim (Days of Awe), known as \\"Machzor le-nusach Barcelona minhag Catalunya\\"Machzor according to the rites of Barcelona and the custom of Catalonia. was first published. According to the colophon, the impression was finished on the eve of Yom Kippur of the year 5287 (1526).In the Responsa of rabbi, Shelomoh ben Avraham ha-Kohen (Maharshakh) mentions the \\"machzor le-yamim noraim be-nusach qahal qadoix Catalan\\". Catalonian Jews published several reprints of the machzor in the nineteenth century. In 1863 they printed an edition titled \\"Machzor le- Rosh ha-Shana ve-Yom ha-Kippurim ke-minhag qahal qadosh Catalan yashan ve- chadash be-irenu zot Saloniki\\".Machzor for Rosh ha-Shana and Yom Kippur according to the custom of the old and new Catalan community of our city of Salonica. This edition was published by Yitschaq Amariliyo. In 1869 the \\"Machzor ke-minhag qahal qadosh Catalan yashan ve-chadash\\" was printed. The editors were: Moshe Yaaqov Ayash and Rabbi Chanokh Pipano, and those who carried out the impression were: David, called Bekhor Yosef Arditi, Seadi Avraham Shealtiel. The machzor was published under the title \\"Machzor le-Rosh ha-Shana kefi minhag Sepharad ba-qehilot ha-qedoshot Saloniqi\\" and includes the prayers of the community of Aragon and the communities Catalan yashan ve- chadash. Machzor according to the custom of the Catalonian Holy communities (Vol. 1: Tefillat Shemuel). Salonica, 1927.National Library of Israel R 41 A 257. The Catalonian Jewish community of Salonica existed as such until the Holocaust.Yitzchaq Shemuel Immanuel, Guedole Salonica le-dorotam, Tel Aviv: 1936 (it includes lists with the surnames of the communities Catalan yashan and Catalan chadash). In 1927, they published a numbered edition in three volumes of the machzor, entitled \\"Machzor le-yamim nora√Øm Kef√≠ Minhag q[ahal] q[adosh] Qatalan, ha-yadua be-shem nusach Bartselona minhag Qatalunya\\"First volume: ¬´Tefillat Shemuel.

In the second volume \\"Tefillat Yaaqov\\", there is a long historical introduction about the Jewish community of Catalonia and the edition of the machzor written in Judeo-Spanish;The Sephardic community (Castile) became the largest and most influential in Salonica, which was how the Judeo-Spanish language (also called Ladino, Judezmo, Spa√±olit, etc.) became the lingua franca of all Jewish communities (including those of Catalonia, France and Ashkenaz). the same summary introduction is found in the first volume \\"Tefillat Shemuel \\", written in Hebrew. Below is a fragment of the translation of the Hebrew version: ¬´One of the most precious pearls that our ancestors brought from the exile of Catalonia, when they had to leave as exiles, was the old order of the prayers of Rosh ha-Shana and Yom Kippur, known as the 'nusach Barcelona, minhag Catalunya'. And because of the misfortunes and tumult of the exile, that arrived of fatal form on the poor wandering refugees, the majority of the customs were confused, and slowly, almost all were fused in the same order of prayers called 'nusach Sepharad', almost all, except some exceptional communities that did not change their customs. The members of the Holy community Catalonia in our city of Salonica did not change their custom, and until today they maintain the tradition of their ancestors and offer their prayers to God on Days of Awe following the ancient nusach that they brought from Catalonia. The Jews of Catalonia were the most prominent among their brothers in the rest of the Sepharad countries and their wisdom and science were superior. The distinguished communities of Barcelona always took pride in the fact that great Rabbis and personalities from their community illuminated the eyes of the whole Jewish diaspora. There was a saying that Sephardic Jews used to say: the air of Barcelona, it makes you wise. ¬ª The Catalonian Jewish community of Salonica was totally annihilated in the Holocaust. The few survivors emigrated to Israel after the war between the years 1945 and 1947. = Settlement in North Africa (Algeria) = The coasts of Catalonia, Valencia and Mallorca are in front of the coast of Algeria. These lands long maintained commercial relations; also, the Jewish communities maintained close ties. After the riots of 1391, a large group of Catalonian Jews fled to the coasts of Algeria. We know that most of the Jews of Barcelona fled and settled in the city of Algiers. At that time, three kingdoms were established in North Africa after the fall of the Almohad, one in the area of present-day Morocco, another in Tunisia and a third in Algeria, which was ruled by the dynasty of Beni- Ziyan from the ancient capital of Tlemcen. In general, the Jews of Castile went to Morocco, while the Jews of Catalonia, Valencia, Mallorca and Aragon went to Algeria and Tunisia.  The Jews of Algiers  Machzor Qatan, according to the custom of the Holy communities of Algiers, Livorno, 1886.National Library of Israel R 56 A 346. The Muslim rulers of Algeria received the Jewish exiles with open arms. As soon as the Christian authorities saw that Jews and converts fled to Algeria, they forbade them from leaving the country, increased their persecution and flight became more difficult. The Jews who settled in Algeria received the status of dhimmis, as is usual in Islamic countries in exchange for paying taxes. The situation of Jews in Algeria before the arrival of the exiles was very poor, both their economic situation and the level of Torah studies. Peninsular refugees contributed to raising the country's economy thanks to commercial activities with European lands and also improved the level of Torah studies. Two of the great later Rishonim, Rabbi Yitzhaq bar Sheshet Perfet (Ribash)The Ribash was for many years the great Rabbi of Catalonia. and Rabbi Shimon ben Tzemac·∏• Duran (Rashbatz)The Rashbatz, had been dedicated in Mallorca to the medical profession. Once in Algeria, where there was not so much demand for this profession, he was forced to earn a living as a rabbi. (Maguen Avot, chap. 4, 45). fled to Algeria. Ribash had long been the grand Rabbi of Catalonia, and Rashbatz, despite his great preparation and knowledge of the Torah, had been dedicated to the medical profession. After a while, Ribash was named Mara de- Atra (maximum rabbinical authority) and head of the Rabbinic Court of the Algiers community, and Rashbatz was appointed Dayan (judge) to his court. When Ribash died, Rashbatz occupied his place. The Jews of Algeria accepted the authority of these two great Rabbis, who were followed by the descendants of Rashbatz, his son Rabbi Shelomo ben Shimon (Rashbash) and his disciples. Throughout the generations, the Jews of Algeria have faithfully and meticulously maintained the spiritual legacy and customs that came from Catalonia. Until today, Ribash, Rashbatz and Rashbash are considered the main Rabbis of Algiers. One of the characteristics of the manner of dictating halakhah by the Rabbis of Algiers throughout generations has been respect for customs and traditions; the established custom has always trumped halakha, and this is a characteristic that was inherited from Bet Midrash of the Ramban. Matters of halakha in Algiers have always been dictated following the school of Ribash, Rashbatz and Rashbash, and not according to the opinions of Maran ha-Bet Yosef (Yosef Caro, and his work the Shulchan Arukh).For example, Rabbi Refael Yedidya Shelomo Tzror (1682-1729), author of the work 'Pri Tzadiq', wrote in his introduction to the Taixbetz book: ¬´In Algiers the local custom is followed, and legal decisions are not issued according to the Bet Yosef ¬ª. In fact, the Jews of Algiers followed the halakhic dictation inherited from the Catalan Bet Midrash of the Ramban and the Rashba. Thus, for example, Rabbi Avraham ibn Taua (1510-1580),Rabbi Avraham ibn Taua was a descendant of the Rashabtz, and at the same time of the Ramban, and served as the head of the Algerian Yeshivah. His Responsa were compiled in two books, one of which was published in the third part of the book 'Chut ha-meshulash, and that the printers added to the fourth volume of the 'Tashbetz' Responsa book. grandson of Rashbatz, responded to a question asked by the Rabbis of Fez on a matter referring to the laws of Shabbat:Tashbetz, vol. 4 ('Chut ha-meshulash), 3, 10. ¬´Answer: Dear Rabbis, God guard you; know that we are [descendants of] the expelled from the land of Catalonia, and according to what our parents of blessed memory used in those lands, we also used in these places where we have dispersed because of our sins. You know that the Rabbis of Catalonia, according to the dictates on which all the customs of our community are based, are Ramban, Rashba, Reah and Ran, of blessed memory, and other great Rabbis who accompanied them in their generation, although their opinions were not published. Therefore, you do not have to question the customs of our community, since as long as you cannot find any of the issues explicitly mentioned in the books, it should be assumed that they followed the custom according to these great Rabbis. ¬ª Also, regarding the order of prayers and piyyutim, the Jews of Algiers were strictly conservative with the customs that came from Catalonia. Machzor minhag Algiers, for example, arrived from Catalonia around 1391.Rabbi Yitzchaq Morali (1867-1952), in his introduction to machzor minhag Alger, writes: \\"This machzor was brought by our Sepharad parents when they fled from the ravages of 1391, and our Rabbis Ribash and Rashbatz, of holy and blessed memory, kept it. And thus, accustomed the later generations¬ª. Chokhmat Misken: ve-hu sefer Qrovats, Livorno, 1772.National Library of Israel R 23 V 2883. In the eighteenth century, scholars questioned some of the ancient customs saying that they contradicted the dictates of Rabbi Yitzchaq Luria Ashkenazi (Arizal) (1534-1572). The old custom that came from Catalonia consisted of reciting piyyutim (and also prayers and supplications) in the middle of prayer. They argued that the custom of the city had to be changed. So, they began to change the nusach of the prayers that had been in force in Algiers since ancient times. The Algerian Rabbis opposed this development, arguing that the old custom could not be changed,See: Shelomo Ouaknin, ¬´Teshuvot chakhme Algir ve-Tunis be-inyan shinui be-minhag ha-tefillah be-Algir¬ª, Mekabtziel 39, pp. 33-102 (in Hebrew). but in the following generations, most synagogues in the city of Algiers did change the rite of prayer and adopted the custom of the Arizal (known as the custom of the Kabbalists, minhag ha-mequbalim).Minhag ha-mequbalim was established around 1765. Only two synagogues maintained the ancient custom (known as the custom of literalists, minhag ha-pashtamim): The Great Synagogue and the synagogue Yakhin u-Boaz (later renamed Guggenheim Society). The piyyutim mentioned above, which are recited on special Shabbatot and festivals, etc., were edited in a book called Qrovatz.Nehoray ben Seadya Azoviv, 'Chokhmat Misk√©n: ve-hu sefer Qrovatz she-nahagu leomram ha-qahal ha-qadosh she-be-ir Argel', Livorno 1772. The Jews from Algiers have maintained the texts and melodies that arrived in Algiers during the period of the Ribash and the Rashbatz until the present day. According to the tradition, these are the original melodies that arrived from Catalonia with the two great Rabbis.In the synagogues where minhag ha-mequbalim was imposed, they also maintained the melodies and nusach of piyyutim, although they were told outside the tefillah (amidah) and the blessings of the Shema reading, as is nowadays accustomed to the minhag of the Sephardim. In 2000, the annual Ethnomusicology Workshop was held,The workshop was organized by the faculty of music of the University of Bar-Illan with the collaboration of the phonotheque of the National Library of Israel and the Jewish Music Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. which focused on the customs and liturgical tradition of the Jews of Algeria.Edwin Seroussi & Eric Karsenti, ¬´The Study of Liturgical Music of Algerian Jewry¬ª. Pe‚Äôamim 91 (2002), pp. 31-50. Algerian cantors from France and Israel attended. The workshop was recorded and today the recordings can be listened to on the website of the National Library of Israel. The liturgy of Shabbat, Rosh Chodesh, Yamim Noraim, festivals, fasts and piyyutim for various celebrations were recorded. Although more than 600 years have elapsed, and there have been certain alterations, we can affirm that the uniqueness of the liturgical tradition of the Jews of Algiers largely preserves the medieval tradition of liturgical songs of the Jews of Catalonia.

Description Barony was designed by George Rahm and Joseph Hillmer, with cover art and interior illustrations by Todd Pickens. The game comes as three books: * 42-page rule book * 39 page scenario design book * 52-page encounters book The game also includes a tarot deck printed on three letter-sized pieces of cardstock, and a referee's screen. Gameplay =Character generation= # Players choose one of four professions for their character: Footman (soldier), Bumpkin (duelist), Street Urchin (thief) or Student (mage). # Players then choose one of six Traits for the character from: Bold, Clever, Energetic, Magical, Methodical, and Rugged. Players also roll an eight-sided die to determine if their character has any other Traits. # Rather than choosing an exact weapon, players choose a combat skill from a descriptive list such Hero's Great Weapon, Ranged Power Blow or Foul Blow. # There is no list of equipment to choose from -- characters are assumed to have the proper equipment for each adventure. If a character needs a particular piece of equipment for a certain situation, the player rolls a skill check to see if the character remembered that piece of equipment. =Character advancement= Characters gain a new level or stage for each adventure completed successfully, and choose advancement in any one of the four beginning professions. If a player chooses to advance the character along the same profession path, the character can reach the highest possible level after as few as eight adventures. Moving a character from profession to profession will slow the rate of advancement down. =Skill resolution= Skills have four categories: Gifted; Learned; Practiced and Patient; and Physical and Combat. For a character to complete a task, the referee assigns a Difficulty to the task (Simple, Difficult, or Tasking), and the player rolls two eight-sided dice to determine success. =Combat= There are no exact weapons in this game, only the character's combat skill. There are no hit points ‚Äî both characters and their opponents have a list of adjectives describing their health, divided into four columns corresponding to the severity of the wound received (Bruise/Cut; Bleeder; Vicious; and Spirit). The tougher the character or opponent, the more adjectives are contained in each list. Each time a creature takes damage, one of the adjectives is marked off. When the last adjective has been removed, the creature is dead. There is also a completely separate combat system for battling dragons. =Magic= Rather than casting a pre-printed spell, the player simply tells the referee what effect is desired, and which of six \\"laws of nature\\" is being broken. The referee judges if the request is reasonable, and decides to what degree the laws of nature are being broken. The player then makes a skill roll for each law being broken, the difficulty being dependent on the degree to which the law is being broken. If the player is not very successful, the character will either have to pay a cost in Magic Points, or if the character has no Magic Points, the player rolls dice to determine a Major Mishap that will inflict the character. Reception In the March 1992 edition of Dragon (Issue #179), Lester Smith Smith found the game \\"amazing in its inventiveness.\\" He liked the outward appearance of the packaged game, but found the titles of the three books too ambiguous, with lack of clarity as to which one he should read first. Smith found a certain \\"lack of polish\\" in the product, with small, dense text with no chapter headings, and a writing style that \\"ranges from mildly difficult to nigh impossible to read in places, and evinces a near complete lack of awareness of the simplest technical writing tricks to make text easy to comprehend. The thing that bothers me most about this is that the creative ideas included in the game deserve better presentation.\\" Despite these problems, Smith believed that \\"The Barony game should be part of every serious role-player‚Äôs library. The magic system, dragon battle system, mission generator, and encounter generator can be adapted very easily to any other fantasy role-playing game, and that FRPG will be the richer for it ... Despite my complaints about the game‚Äôs presentation, I highly recommend the Barony game. In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '80s, Shannon Appelcline noted that Barony and another game by the same company, Era Ten (1992) were part of a movement of \\"'free style roleplay' games\\" in the early 1990s, \\"early 'indie' efforts that tried to break free of the old clich√©s of RPGs and instead offer more story-oriented games.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #26 (April/May, 1991) References Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1990 ","title":"Barony (role-playing game)"},{"id":"62191471","text":"Michael Waidner (born on December 20, 1961 in M√ºhlacker) is a German computer scientist.

In 2010, after completing their PhDs, they came together to found Emerald Therapeutics in an effort to develop \\"antiviral therapeutics for diseases such as HPV and HIV\\". During this time, they experienced frustrations with laboratory hardware and software. Hardware often comes from disparate manufacturers, software is often rudimentary, and output can vary in formatting. To simplify laboratory testing, the group wrote centralized management software for the different machines and a database to store all metadata and results. This \\"laboratory operating system\\" continued to expand in capabilities, including the ability to directly control instrumentation and manage inventory and procurement. Recognizing the value this type of system presented outside of their own development goals, Kleinbaum and Frezza launched this service in 2014 under the name Emerald Cloud Lab. In 2016, Emerald Cloud Lab and Emerald Therapeutics were spun off from one another, and both are independent corporations.Emerald Cloud Lab, Inc., California Corporation Entity Number C3251573. See =Business development= As of 2014, Emerald Cloud Lab offered access to 40 types of laboratory instruments. By 2017, the range of instruments had expanded to 106. Groth, Paul; Cox, Jessica (2017), ‚ÄúDatasets for Potential of Robotic Lab Methods Usage in Biomedical Papers‚Äù, Mendeley Data, v3 http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/gy7bfzcgyd.3#file-2066813b-adc9-425e-a347-51122bdbe944 As of July 2020, Emerald Cloud Lab offered full control of over 150 laboratory instruments, with plans to expand capabilities outlined through 2021. Researchers and pharmaceutical groups have long been concerned about the lack of reproducibility of laboratory testing in the biomedical field. A 2017 literature analysis article posited that highly automated, internet connected labs like ECL could ameliorate the problem. The paper concludes that, \\"we believe that robotic labs can provide the basis for performing a large percentage of basic biomedical research in a reproducible and transparent fashion\\". Frezza has described this laboratory inconsistency as one specific reason for the development of Emerald Cloud Lab and the use of automation. Financing After spinning out of Emerald Therapeutics, the company has gone on to raise capital in multiple rounds. Key investors include Founders Fund, Schooner Capital, OS Fund, Alcazar Capital, Western Technology Investment, Sound Ventures, SciFi VC, Incite Ventures, and Spike Ventures. The business got its second round of funding by 2014 from the Founders Fund (FF), a venture capital firm founded by Peter Thiel, bringing total funding raised from FF up to $13.5 million. The first FF funding round was not public.

During his time in office, the first anti-abbot was elected.  Life  Craloh was the biological brother of his predecessor, Thieto, and was elected on 31 May 942. He is listed in the book of vows but his offices are not known before that. Because he only appears in the monks' registers from 895, one can assume that he entered the monastery after that point in time. There is a record of his work as a scribe in the form of a document from the 27 October 920. His role as abbot is mentioned for the first time in a document from the 12 June 947, in which Otto I granted him the right of coinage in Rorschach.  Works  Craloh's main task was a difficult one. He had to rebuild the abbey after being destroyed in a fire in 937. He was somewhat successful economically, as attested by eight sales or donation of goods to the Abbey of Saint Gall between 948 and 957. His strictness in wanting to reinstate former discipline in the monastery led to friction within the abbey. Part of his reforms was the renewal of a purgatorial society with Reichenau Abbey in 945. In 953/54 those tensions reached their breaking point when Liudolf began his rebellion against Otto I. The majority of monks took Liudolf's side, while Craloh took the side of Otto I. During the revolt, Craloh fled to Otto's court and only returned to the convent after the defeat of the rebellion. In the meantime, the abbey was ruled by Anno, who was elected anti-abbot by the Saint Gall monks. He died before the defeat of Liudolf, so when Cradolf returned he found the abbey under the rule of the monk Viktor. Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg reconciled the convent with the abbot, who ultimately destroyed the monks' trust by sending armed men after Viktor to blind him as he was fleeing to his relatives. As a consequence, Craloh retreated to an estate in Herisau. During the time in which he resided in Herisau, he let Dean Ekkehard I run the abbey on his behalf, wishing him to become next abbot after he died. However, due to a horseriding accident, Ekkehard was unable to assume that role.

The operations to rescue Sujith went viral across the country as prayers were conducted for the rescue operations of the boy. Around 2:00 am, 30 October 2019 officials confirmed the death of the boy, and the last rites were held six hours later. Following and the sensitive and tragic aspect of the two year boy's incident, politicians and celebrities across India paid tribute and offered their condolences for Sujith Wilson.  Development  Sujith fell into the deep bore well on 25 October 2019 at around 5.45 in the evening and was initially stuck at 30 ft but then fell deep to about 88 ft. A constant supply of oxygen was given to the child to help his survival in the deep underground environment with traces of oxygen. A wider tube-well was drilled for over two days in order to rescue the child since initial efforts to save the child from the existing bore hole failed. The officials also felt difficulties to assess the condition of the boy due to covering of mud. Nearly 550 rescue operators were indulged in this rescue operation. The whole incident went viral across all social media platforms and led to the development of hashtags such as #PrayforSujith and #SujithWilson went viral on Twitter in support of the rescue operations.  Death  The rescue operation was put on hold in late night on 28 October 2019 after detecting the odor of decomposition at the top of the bore well.

He came into the Abbey of Saint Gall at a young age as an oblate and was made deacon under Craloh. His first documented mention is dated at 959/60. His predecessor Ekkehart I, whom Craloh had selected to be his successor, but an injury following a riding accident prevented him from holding office.

In 2019, she was arrested and sentenced to a year in prison for allegedly having an illegal abortion and sex out of wedlock, though she was later pardoned by King Mohammed VI.  Early life and career  Hajar was born in 1991 in Larache, Morocco. She grew up in a conservative family. Her father was a farmer and her mother is a housewife. She received a traditional religious education and chose to wear the hijab as a teenager. After getting her baccalaureate, she moved to Sal√© in 2009 and enrolled at the Faculty of Sciences in Rabat. After a bachelor's degree in mathematics, she changed her path and choose to be a journalist. She enrolled in law school and then in political science while publishing her first articles in Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, a left-wing Arabic- language daily. At the time, Hajar was close to the (MUR) created by her uncle Ahmad al-Raysuni. She was hired at Attajdid, the daily newspaper of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) where she worked for two years. During 2015, Hajar distanced herself from the movement and then left Attajdid in 2016. In Akhbar Al Yaoum, where she works with her uncle Soulaimane Raissouni, she writes as much on the demonstrations of unemployed graduates as on the crisis of medical students or the reform of national education. Recently, she was interested in street children and was preparing a survey on the Christian community resulting from sub-Saharan immigration in Morocco.  Arrest  On August 31, 2019, Raissouni was arrested while leaving a gynecologist's office in Rabat, along with her partner Rifaat Al Amine, her gynecologist Dr. Jamal Belkeziz, and another doctor and an office assistant at the clinic. The police had been investigating the clinic for abortions Hajar Raissouni and Dr. Jamal Belkeziz said she was there to receive treatment for internal bleeding. At the trial, the Raissouni was able to prove scientifically that she had not had an abortion, but she was still found guilty. Raissouni and her partner Rifaat Al Amine were both sentenced to a year in prison, while the gynecologist, Dr. Jamal Belkeziz, was given 2 years in prison. Another doctor and an office assistant at the clinic were given suspended sentences.  Controversy  Raissouni's family and supporters believe the accusation and sentence were politically motivated. She works as a journalist for Akhbar Al Yaoum, an independent news outlet critical of the state. In her article in the New York Times, Aida Alami noted that \\"Reporters Without Borders ranks Morocco 135th in its annual press freedom index.\\" Hajar Raissouni's uncle, Ahmad al-Raysuni, is a former leader of an Islamist group with significant political influence in Morocco, though he has spoken out in condemnation of the political campaign to change the laws that were used to condemn Hajar Raissouni. The case stirred significant controversy in Morocco. The Democratic League for Women's Rights () organized protests in support of Raissouni, and many public figures, such as Ahmed Benchemsi, spoke out on her behalf.  Pardon  On October 17, 2019, King Muhammad VI gave Hajar Raissouni, her partner Rifaat Al Amine, her gynecologist Dr. Jamal Belkeziz, and the second doctor and the assistant from the clinic, a royal pardon. An official statement from the Moroccan Ministry of Justice explained: \\"In the context of His Majesty the King's compassion and mercy, His Majesty's sought to protect the future of the two fianc√©es that intend to start a family in accordance with the rule of law, in spite of the mistake that they may have made, which led to legal prosecution.\\" The move was simultaneously welcomed and criticized by rights groups, including The Coalition For Women In Journalism which noted despite being great news for Hajar, the pardon did not do justice to the issues that women journalists are tackling in the country. \\"Hajar is only free because of the pardon and not because it was recognized that the state had no business sticking its nose into her personal life. Where she has been released because of the extreme backlash the country had to face, we have to think of situations where a journalist may not hold the same kind of attention in the news,\\" the organization said.  Aftermath  Raissouni's case sparked the Kharija Ala L'Qanun () or Outlaws campaign, an ongoing campaign for the legalization of abortion and sex outside marriage in Morocco. One of the campaign's aims is the reform of abortion laws in Morocco, which currently only permit an abortion if woman's life at risk.

Harmon (1839 ‚Äì December 24, 1889) was an attorney and politician in Florida after the Civil War. He was the first African-American to be admitted to the bar in Florida.  Early life  Henry Harmon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1839. His parents, Timothy and Robinet Harmon, had been slaves in Virginia, but had escaped to the North before Henry was born. Although details of his young years are scarce, Henry was later described as \\"a [man] of education.\\" Harmon enlisted in the 3rd United States Colored Infantry Regiment when it was formed in August 1863, and was promoted to the rank of sergeant before the end of the year. He served with the Third USCI at the sieges of Fort Wagner and Fort Gregg on Morris Island. Harmon became friends with future congressman Josiah T. Walls while serving in the Third. At the end of the Civil War, a portion of the Third Regiment, including Harmon, was stationed in Gainesville, Florida. Harmon was discharged from the Army in Gainesville in late 1865. In letters to the Philadelphia Christian Recorder (a publication of the African Methodist Episcopal Church), Harmon expressed his dissatisfaction over the position of African-Americans in the South. In the first two years after the end of the Civil War control of southern states was returned to men who had supported the Confederacy, who instituted black codes that restricted the rights of African-Americans. Resistance by African- Americans to the black codes was met with violence by whites, and in 1866 Alachua County, of which Gainesville was the county seat, was placed under martial law.  Political office  Starting in March 1867, the Military Reconstruction Acts restored federal military control to the former Confederate states. Former Confederate officials and supporters were temporarily barred from voting and holding office and African-Americans were guaranteed the right to vote. Harmon was soon appointed as a voting registrar in Alachua County. In March 1868 Harmon served as a vice president of the Alachua County Republican Party Convention. He and Josiah Walls were nominated for, and won, seats in the Florida House of Representatives, serving until 1870. Harmon concentrated on improvements to the administration of government and generally avoided controversial proposals on social issues, for which he was criticized by more radical elements of the Republican Party. Harmon is credited with helping to pass legislation established free public education in Florida. Harmon was elected to the Gainesville town commission in 1869. In 1970, while campaigning for another term in the Florida House of Representative, Harmon and Josiah Walls, who was running for the Florida seat in the United States Congress, were denied a cabin on the steamboat Oklawaha, and had to sleep on the deck. Harrison Reed, Republican governor of Florida, joined the two on deck. The governor of Florida appointed Harmon clerk of the court for Alachua County in 1871. This position included keeping records for the county commission and the courts in the county, overseeing county government operations, and witnessing and recording deeds and mortgages. Harmon, as clerk of the court, together with the county judge and a justice of the peace, all Republicans, served on the board of canvassers for Alachua County in the election of 1872. The board of canvassers threw out the results from two precincts because the returns, which favored the Republicans, had been forged. Republican party officials pressured the board to count the fraudulent votes. The county judge, William Birney, was arrested on the order of Republican party leaders, and Harmon and the other canvasser were threatened by the \\"Liberty Hill Gang\\", a radical faction of the Republican Party in Florida. Harmon ran for the Florida Senate in 1872, but the Republican Party was split and Harmon lost to the incumbent Democrat. Harmon remained well regarded in the Republican Party, and he was appointed chief clerk of the Florida House of Representatives in 1873. He was re-elected to that post in 1874 and 1875. He was also appointed to a customs post in Tampa in 1873, but he was resented as an outsider, and apparently did not serve long in the post. The Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in Florida, and Democrats gained control of state government. Despite the loss of opportunity for African-Americans in politics and in appointed positions in state government, Harmon remained active in the Republican Party. He was a delegate to the 1876 Republican National Convention. He was secretary to the State Republican Executive Committee in 1880 and an officer of the 1880 Florida Republican state convention. He was appointed the deputy United States collector of revenue for Florida in June of that year. Political patronage positions in the Federal government for African-Americans in the South ended when Grover Cleveland became President in 1885. Harmon did not hold any elected or appointed office after that.  Legal career  In May 1869 Harmon applied to the circuit court to be admitted to the bar. The court appointed two members of the Alachua County bar to examine Harmon, and they reported to the court that he was competent to practice law in Florida. Harmon was the first African-American admitted to the bar in Florida. In June 1874 Harmon formed a law partnership in Gainesville with Josiah Walls, who had been admitted to the bar after Harmon had, and William U. Saunders, who had been sent to Florida from Maryland after the Civil War by the Republican National Committee to help organize the party in Florida. The next year Harmon and Saunders opened a law office in Tallahassee specializing in government land claims. Although the end of Reconstruction in 1877 had ended Harmon's chances for election to public office, he could still practice law in Tallahassee. African-Americans were still serving on juries, and the United States court system was still in Republican hands. Harmon's appointment as deputy collector of revenue in 1880 resulted in him withdrawing from the practice of law.  Arrest for fraud  Harmon was arrested in March 1874 and charged with fraud and forgery. It was alleged that, while serving as clerk of the court for Alachua County, Harmon had altered the amounts on county scrip that he redeemed and subsequently presented to the county commission for reimbursement. Harmon was released on bail, but the case did not go to trial until April 1876, when Harmon was found not guilty. Harmon avoided political office while the charge was pending, declining an attempt to nominate him for mayor of Gainesville.  Other activities  In 1867, Harmon was a founding member of the Board of Trustees for the Union Academy in Gainesville, the first school for African-Americans in Gainesville and Alachua County. In 1875, Harmon was one of several African-American leaders who requested that part of the money allocated to the West Florida Seminary be re-allocated to support schools serving African-Americans. In 1876, Harmon served as the head of a committee on education at an assembly of \\"colored men\\" of Florida held in Tallahassee. The committee issued a report calling for the establishment of an agricultural college serving African-Americans. That year, the school board in Leon County appointed Harmon as principal of the recently rebuilt Lincoln Academy in Tallahassee. He lost that position the next year with the return to power of the Democrats. Around 1880 Harmon became involved in the newspaper business. He was reported to be the publisher of three newspapers in east central Florida, the Volusia County News in Orange City, and the Florida Star and Indian River Times in Titusville. With the loss of Federal patronage positions in Florida after 1885, and facing difficulties resuming a legal career with local and state courts increasing hostile to African-Americans, Harmon opened a successful cabinetmaking and upholstery business in Tallahassee.  Family life  Harmon married local resident Sophia Ligon in Gainesville in November 1865, shortly after being discharged from the army. When he moved to Tallahassee in 1876 Sophia remained in Gainesville. Harmon transferred his property in Alachua County to Sophia in 1877. It is not clear how Harmon's marriage to Sophia ended, but by the early 1880s he had married again. In 1883, Henry and Nancy Harmon adopted Lydia DeCoursey, who may have been the daughter of Phillip DeCoursey. Decoursey had been sheriff of Leon County for nine months before his death from pneumonia in 1875. In 1885, the Florida state census listed Harmon as \\"widowed\\". Harmon died in Tallahassee on December 24, 1889.

Built in 1939, the church closed in 1979 and is now part of a residential development named St Michael's Court. History St Michael's was built to replace a temporary mission church of 1909, which was located at Elmbank Road and had 200 sittings. Owing to the dilapidated condition of the building and the need for improved church accommodation in the parish, the vicar of Paignton, Rev. B. Montague Dale, launched an appeal in February 1937 to raise ¬£10,000 for the construction of two new, permanent churches. Construction of the first church, St George's at Goodrington, began after ¬£5,000 had been raised in six months. A plot of land for the proposed new church of St Michael was donated by Mr. Herbert Whitley of Primley and plans for the building drawn up by the ecclesiastical architects Messrs. Tonar and Drury of Exeter. Once the majority of the second ¬£5,000 had been raised towards Rev. Dale's appeal, construction of St Michael's began in early 1939, although the foundation stone was not laid by the Bishop of Crediton, Rev. William Surtees, until 23 June 1939. It was constructed by Messrs. Willcocks and Barnes of Paignton for a cost of ¬£6,000. The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter, the Right Rev. Charles Curzon, on 2 December 1939. St Michael's was declared redundant on 1 April 1979. It was sold the following year to Devon Community Housing Society Ltd and planning permission was approved to extend and convert the building for the creation of 35 flats. The church now forms part of St Michael's Court, a development offering sheltered and retired housing.

It tells the story of King Hjalmar and his close friend (and later son-in-law) Ramer as they engage in various conflicts set in ancient Scandinavia. History of the text The saga first appeared as a published dissertation which stated in an introduction that it was edited from parchment fragments found by the dissertation's author, Lucas Halpap.Lucas Halpap, Fragmentum mscr. runici... (Uppsala, 1690), unnumbered page at start of dissertation: ‚ÄúNam hoc ipsum ego M. ss. ante aliquot menses a Rustico quondam pretio vel contemnendo mini comparavi‚Äù (‚ÄúFor I bought this very manuscript a few months ago at a shockingly cheap price from a farmer‚Äù). The text of the fragments was apparently written in runes, reproduced for the reader by Halpap along with a translation into Swedish. The language presented in the runes is similar to Old Norse but with a haphazard grammar and a vocabulary which at times is closer to early modern Swedish. The dissertation aroused the interest of a number of antiquarians, and the saga came to be edited on two more occasions within fifteen years of its appearance.Kay Busch, ‚ÄúGrossmachtstatus und Sagainterpretation.

While Halpap clearly played a role in the appearance of the forgery, there has been disagreement as to who was the intellectual author, although most agree that it stems from the circle of scholars close to Olof (or ‚ÄúOlaus‚Äù) Rudbeck (1630‚Äì1702) at Uppsala University (see below, Theories about Authorship).  Synopsis  The saga begins with Hjalmar and Ramer setting out on an expedition from their home in Thulemark (probably roughly equivalent to modern-day Telemark). They go to Bjarmaland where the defeat King Wagmar. Hjalmar thus becomes king there and settles down, marrying Wagmar's daughter. They have two children together, a son named Tromi and a daughter named Heidil. Heidil attracts various suitors, first being abducted by a berserk and retrieved by Thor, after Hjalmar has prayed for his aid. Heidil is then married to Ramer, but another suitor, Ulfr, is unhappy about this. Ramer and Heidil leave to establish themselves on an island close to Thulemark. At this point the manuscript is damaged, but when the narrative is taken up once more Ulfr has attacked their home. Ramer manages to escape and returns to Hjalmar. Hjalmar and Ramer end up meeting Ulfr in a sea-battle, during which Hjalmar is killed and Ramer is captured. The story ends with Ulfr putting the pagan priests to flight, with them eventually seeking out the home of a man whom the narrator claims was his father.  Editions and Manuscript  After Halpap's edition appeared in the form of his thesis in 1690, Sweden's Riksantikvarie (‚ÄúState Antiquarian‚Äù) of the time, Johan Hadorph, was eager to see the manuscript which Halpap had based his edition on.For a description of Hadorph's attempt to get the manuscript, see G√∂del, pp. 139‚Äì42. Halpap had, however, travelled abroad for studies. It was only in 1694 that a manuscript appeared in Stockholm, by which time Hadorph had died.Ibid. The new Riksantkvarie, Johan Peringski√∂ld, produced a new edition based on the manuscript, this time with a runic text, a transrunification and both a Swedish and Latin translation. No date appears in the edition, but it is believed be from 1701.See G√∂del, p. 143. The manuscript was eventually transferred to the Kungliga Bibliotek (‚ÄúRoyal Library‚Äù) in Stockholm, where it is still found today under the shelfmark V. r. 1a. Peringski√∂ld's edition also served as the basis for the text which appeared in 1703 in George Hickes' Linguarum vetterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archaeologicus.See p. 123 available at archive.org  Theories about Authorship  Vilhelm G√∂del, in his article on the matter, says that Halpap was probably too young and inexperienced to have produced the forgery on his own. G√∂del thus says: : Jag m√• dock f√• s√§ga, att man v√§l kan ha sk√§l att rikta sina misstankar mot den i m√•nga af sina uppgifter s√• otillf√∂rlitliga Lundius.See G√∂del, p. 153. : (I must however be permitted to say that there may well be reason to direct one's suspicions at Lundius, who in so many of his dealings was so untrustworthy.) Carl Lundius (1638‚Äì1715) was a friend of Olof Rudbeck and thus shared many of the ideas associated with Rudbeckianism.Information in Swedish on Lundius' life and work can be found at Svensk Biografiskt Lexikon. Henrik Sch√ºck agreed with G√∂del, pointing out that Lundius had written a thesis on Zalmoxis, a figure mentioned in Herodotus' Histories, whom Lundius believed had been the first lawmaker of the ancient Goths (i.e. the ancient inhabitants of Sweden and ancestors of the Swedes). Lundius' thesis, entitled ‚ÄúZamolxis Primus Getarum Legislator‚Äù, had been published just three years prior to the appearance of Halpap's dissertation, namely in 1687. It connects to the manuscript which Halpap claims to have found, since a few lines of a story appear before the beginning of Hjalmars och Ramers saga there, and among those lines we find mentioned ‚Äúsamolis‚Äù who came from the Greeks (presumably intended to be the same as Zamolxis/Zalmoxis). On this basis, Sch√ºck says: : Inf√∂r dessa fakta synes det om√∂jligt att f√∂rneka Lundius' skuld, ty att fyndet just var avsett att styrka hans uppgifter om Zamolxis.Henrik Sch√ºck, Kgl. vitterhets historie och antikvitets akademien. Dess f√∂rhistoria och historia, vol. III (Antikvitetskollegiet II) (Stockholm, 1993), pp. 113‚Äì114. : (Faced with these facts it seems impossible to deny Lundius' culpability, since the find was precisely calculated to strengthen his information about Zamolxis.) Nils Ahnlund, however, speculated as to whether a forger named Nils Rabenius might have played a part in the creation of the saga: : [...] i episoden med den uppl√§ndske allmogemannen, som √∂verl√§mnar manuskriptet till Halpap, erinrar icke s√• litet om Ullspegelsynnet hos den person, som √•tminstone i tv√• s√§rskilda fall bevisligen anv√§nt Lundius som sin kanal.Nils Ahnlund, Nils Rabenius (1648‚Äì1717) (Stockholm: Hugo Gebers Forlag, 1927), p. 150. : ([...] in the episode involving the common man from Uppland, who hands the manuscript over to Halpap, we are reminded in no small way of the picaresque nature of the person [i.e. Nils Rabenius] who on at least two occasions demonstrably used Lundius as an intermediary.)

It was known for economical but excellent quality food, where the diners served themselves from shared dishes set out on a long table in the dining room. There were few rooms, so most of the artists boarded elsewhere in the town. Its most famous resident was Paul Gauguin who stayed several times between 1886 and 1894. Today the building houses a bookstore, gallery and exhibition space. Artists discover the village Pont-Aven was \\"discovered\\" in 1864 by the American painter Henry Bacon (1839‚Äì1912). Two American art students, Earl Shinn (1838‚Äì1886) and Howard Roberts (1843‚Äì1900), arrived in Paris in the spring on 1866 and applied for admission to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Their teacher in Philadelphia, Robert Wylie (1839‚Äì1877), had encouraged them to visit Pont-Aven in the summer. Word spread, and about twelve American and English artists spent the summer of 1866 in the village. The villager were friendly to the artists, found them studio space in the run-down Ch√¢teau de Lezaven, and were glad to pose for them. The painters appreciated the beauty of the surrounding landscape and the low living costs. They would use barns or sheds as studios. A growing number of foreign artists returned year after year, and some settled more or less permanently. French artists began to visit the village in the mid- to late 1870s. The village became fashionable with members of the Salon in Paris. The artists stayed at the H√¥tel des Voyageurs or the Pension Gloanec, or else found lodgings in the villagers' houses. Proprietors The Pension Gloanec was opened in 1860 by Marie-Jeanne Gloanec (1839‚Äì1915) and Joseph Gloanec (1829‚Äì1906). Marie-Jeanne Morvant, later known as \\"La M√®re Gloanec\\", was born on 8 February 1839 in Pont-Aven, daughter of a tailor and a chambermaid. Some time later her father opened a small inn, where Marie-Jeanne learned the trade. Her future husband was born on 10 March 1829 in Pont-Scorff. Both Joseph and Marie-Jeanne Gloanec were almost illiterate. Joseph Gloanec worked as a sawyer and mill repairer before they opened the inn. Arthur Hoeber (1854‚Äì1915) described him as a \\"prince of scoundrels and incomparable idlers, with a halo of vague and misty tales of his early life as a smuggler and wrecker on the wild coast nearby, never quite authenticated, but giving him much distinction and interest.\\" Birge Harrison (1854‚Äì1929) described Marie Jeanne Gloanec as a \\"dear, wizened, motherly woman. She was an excellent cook, and took great pleasure in the company of her artists. Inn Artists outside the pension (1880). H√¥tel de Voyageurs in background. Gauguin 1886 La Nappe blanche The Pension Gloanec was at the entrance to the Pont-Aven village square. There were few rooms for rent, and most of the artists lived elsewhere in the town and only ate at the pension. The auberge had only two rooms on the ground floor. At the front the kitchen-living room was entered from the square, and had a large fireplace. Corwin Knapp Linson (1864‚Äì1959) said the kitchen had two great Breton beds on either side of the fireside in which the mistress and her maids slept. He wrote that the \\"time honoured fireplace was framed in a blazonment of brass and copper utensils which blinked, flashed, glowed according to ever changing humour of light.\\" Behind the kitchen was the dining room, where food was served \\"to fatten you on the spot\\". The dining room was lined with beams and floorboards, drawings and studies. The work of the regular guests covered the walls of the kitchen and dining room, depicting the local men and women who posed for the artists. The patronnes would often extend credit to the artists, or accept paintings as payment, and the artists were proud to have their work accepted and displayed. In this way, the Gloanecs acquired a major collection. The painter √âdouard Girardet (1819‚Äì1880) described the pension in 1876, when Aloysius O'Kelly (1853‚Äì1936) was staying there, as the rowdiest of the inns compared to the H√¥tel des Voyageurs, favored by the Americans and the H√¥tel du Lion d'Or, favored by the French. Thomas Hovenden stayed in the pension at that time, as did the American brothers Alexander and Birge Harrison. Henry Blackburn's Breton Folk: An Artistic Tour of Brittany (1880) described the pension as a quaint little auberge down by the bridge. The signboard was painted by one of the inmates, and the panels of the rooms were also decorated with works of art. It was the true Bohemian home in the town where lodgings and two good meals per day with cider could be had for sixty francs a month. In the evening and in the morning, casually-dressed artists could be seen sitting around a table in the road, some of them with worldwide reputations. Birge Harrison wrote in 1888 that the delicious food of the dear old Marie-Jeanne was known by all the artists. Three busy waitresses served the tables with steaming dishes among the hubbub and gaiety, and from time to time Marie-Jeanne appeared at the door to join the cheerful atmosphere. Mortimer Menpes (1855‚Äì1938) stayed at the Pension Gloanec with his wife and daughter Dorothy. Dorothy described the dining room \\"where rough men sat on either side of a long table, serving themselves out of a common dish, and dipping great slices of bread into their plates.\\" Dorothy's mother categorized the painters as \\"Stripists, Dottists and Spottists, a sect of the Dottists, whose differentiation was too subtle to be understood. Several other artists stayed at the pension, including √âmile Bernard and Arthur Wesley Dow. Gauguin Kitchen of the pension in 1892(?). Paul Gauguin in center Paul Gauguin first stayed at the Pension Gloanec in June 1886, and found that the guests were almost all foreigners. Gauguin's studio in the Pension Gloanec in 1888 was decorated by prints by Utamaro. In early October 1888 Paul S√©rusier was staying at the Pension Gloanec, where he submitted a canvas to Gauguin for criticism. The next morning Gauguin took him to the Bois d'Amour on the edge of Pont-Aven and gave him a lesson in colour. That morning S√©rusier painted The Talisman (1888), which he described to his friends when he returned to Paris as being based on \\"the concept, still unknown to us of the painting as a flat surface covered in colours assembled in a certain order.\\" Gauguin left Pont-Aven in 1889 to escape from the many painters living there. Marie Jeanne Gloanec, \\"la m√®re des peintres\\", earned enough from her painters to build a larger hotel in the town square. In 1892 the establishment was transferred to the Hotel Gloanec on the town square, later renamed the Hotel Le Glouannec. The writer Alfred Jarry (1873‚Äì1907) visited Pont-Aven in June 1894 and booked into the Pension Gloanec, where he found Gauguin laid up with a broken leg caused by a fall during a fight with some fishermen in Concarneau. Gauguin spent his enforced stay in the inn making woodcuts from the subjects of his Tahitian paintings. Jarry wrote poems about three of Gauguin's Tahitian paintings in the Pension Gloanec Livre d'or, which had been started on 23 June 1894 by Gauguin, Eric Forbes-Robertson (1865‚Äì1935) and Roderic O'Conor (1860‚Äì1940). Jarry dated his poems 1 July 1894 and dedicated them to Gauguin. Jarry created the woodcut illustrations for his first book while in Pont-Aven. Later history Marie-Jeanne died in 1915. Today the original Pension Gloanec is home to a bookstore that specializes in artistic books, with an area for meetings and exhibitions, and a permanent exhibition work by Henri Rivi√®re and Breton prints. The Hotel Gloanec is now Les Ajoncs d'Or.

Its causes laid in French disregard for Malagasy culture, executions without trial by French administrators, heavy taxation, and forced labour. Malagasy Protestants tended to support the uprising, while Malagasy Catholics tended to oppose it. For this reason, a large amount of Catholic churches were burned down by the rebels. Timeline It began on 17 November 1904, when Sergent Vinay, chief of the military post of Amparihy, was stabbed to death by a group of Malagasy rebels in his cabin in the village of Marotsipanga. The murderers included a chieftain named Mahafiry and his two sons Imoza and Fandrana. Upon sharing the news of the murder on 19 November, Mahafiry convinced locals in Amparihy to join him in an uprising against French rule in Madagascar. Rebel military decisions at that point came to be handled by 2 indigenous corporals, Kotavy and Tsimanindry. A subsequent French punitive expedition by Lieutenant Baguet would end up being a disaster for the French, with the French assault on Amparihy being repelled and with Baguet being killed. Kotavy's exploits in the Battle of Amparihy transformed him, almost overnight, from a French deserter to a revolutionary leader aimed at overthrowing French rule in Madagascar. Having defeated the French at Amparihy, the rebellion spread to Midony, Ranotsara, Befotaka, and Begogo. At Begogo, the rebels massacred a group of French soldiers. In late November, the rebels reached the district of Vondrozo and the French post at Bemahala. On 2 December, a rebel attack on Vatanato was barely repelled after reserves aided the French defenders. That defeat notwithstanding, the rebels captured Ranomafana (2 Dec), Isaka (3 Dec), Esira (3 Dec), Itapert (4 Dec), Fort Dauphin (4 Dec), and Menambaro (6 Dec). The rebel advance was marked by widespread looting. However, rebel victories were not to last. On 23 November, A military expedition under Captain Quinque encompassing 100 guns was dispatched from Vangaindrano towards Begogo and Ranotsara. On 2 December, Quinque's forces defeated the rebels at Ambiliony and subsequently captured the villages of Ranotsara and Begogo. From Ranotsara, Quinque's forces advanced on Ihosy, where they massacred 18 civilians. The French attempted to follow up these victories by defeating Kotavy's forces at Iobomary, but were unsuccessful, with Kotavy repelling every assault and still controlling the village by March 1905. However, with resources dwindling, Kotavy was forced to retreat to a better defensive position, and on 15 March his forces retreated to Papanga, to the northwest of Ranotsara. Eventually Kotavy had to also abandon Papanga and had to hide in the forest of Farahigelahy, northwest of Amparihy. After the information regarding his whereabouts was given to the French by one of his captured supporters on 19 August, Kotavy was finally arrested on 30 August in Sandravinany. After the fall of Kotavy, other rebel leaders quickly surrendered, ending the revolt. Kotavy was executed on 5 September. Despite another uprising in 1947, Madagascar would remain under French rule until 1960.

It was a short-lived venture, being replaced by a railway which used the canal bed for most of its route in 1854. History The River Eden flows through the city of Carlisle, and into the Solway Firth. There were coal mines at Maryport, a little further down the coast, and prior to 1720, places along the river were supplied with coal by boats. However, this trade ended in 1720, when duties were levied on all goods carried around the coast by sea, and it became cheaper to transport the coal by land. Three traders from Carlisle, John Hicks, Henry Orme and Thomas Pattinson, sought an Act of Parliament which would waive the coastwise duties between Ellen Foot, as Maryport was then known, and Bank End, which was locate on the river close to Carlisle. The Act enabled them to build wharves, cranes and warehouses, and to dredge the river. They obtained the Act in 1721, and could charge tolls on goods for 31 years, but there were no powers to make cuts or build locks to improve the river. On the other side of the country, there was a scheme to extend navigation on the River Tyne westwards from Newburn to Hexham, which was not actioned, but from 1794 there were various schemes to extend or bypass the River Tyne, most of which were described as being part of a coast to coast canal which might end at Carlisle or Maryport. The aspirations of the traders of Carlisle were more local, as they wanted improved facilities for ships bringing goods to Carlisle from Liverpool, Ireland, and Scottish ports. In 1795, three ships carrying around 35 tons each were regularly running between Liverpool and Sandsfield, about from Carlisle, from where some 1,000 tons of goods per year were carried by road to the city. In 1807, Mersey flats regularly made the journey from the River Mersey, carrying timber, and in 1818, six boats were engaged in the trade from Liverpool. Access along the river was not ideal, as the boats often had to wait in the estuary until the tide was suitable. The idea of a canal gained support locally when a public meeting was held on 21 May 1807. The principal aim was to provide the city with a better and cheaper supply of coal, and a committee was appointed to push the plan forwards. They asked the engineer William Chapman to advise them, and he proposed a route from Carlisle to Maryport, which he had also promoted in 1795 as part of a coast to coast route. He estimated that it would cost between ¬£90,000 and ¬£100,000 to build, but conceded that a terminus near Bowness on the Solway Firth would be cheaper. ¬£40,000 would pay for a canal suitable for 45-ton boats, but a larger canal, suitable for 90-ton boats that could cross the Irish Sea or reach the Forth and Clyde Canal, would cost between ¬£55,000 and ¬£60,000. The larger canal could still be part of a coast to coast route. The options as to the size and destination of the canal wer put to subscribers by the committee. In August 1807 Chapman suggested that a ship canal for the Irish, Scottish and Liverpool trade, and a 50-ton canal to Maryport for the coal trade could both be built, with both finding support in the newspapers. The Committee sought a second opinion from Thomas Telford, who produced a report on 6 February 1808. He described a Cumberland Canal, which would allow sea-going vessels to reach Carlisle, but would also be part of a grander plan to link Carlisle to other parts of the country, and could be incorporated into the coast to coast waterway. He suggested that locks should be at least as big as those on the Forth and Clyde Canal, with a width of and a depth of water of over the lock cills. His canal would leave the Solway Firth about upstream of Bowness-on- Solway to reach Carlisle, and would cost ¬£109,393. In order to provide a water supply, a navigable feeder would continue onwards to Wigton, which would be suitable for wide narrow boats, and would cost an additional ¬£38,139. He also quoted two other prices for narrower canals, but noted that these would require goods to be transferred to smaller boats, with the inherent costs and inconvenience. Chapman suggested that a steam pump would be a better way to supply water, unless the Wigton route was likely to be commercially profitable, and also suggested somewhat smaller locks, at long, wide with of water over the cills. This would enable Mersey flats to reach Carlisle, without resorting to transhipment. However, no further progress was made at that time. After eight and a half years, another meeting was held at Carlisle on 7 October 1817, and Chapman was asked to produce a survey for a canal suitable for vessels of at least 70 tons. He was to ensure that it could become part of the coast to coast link. His canal started at Fisher's Cross, subsequently named Port Carlisle, although this name had also been applied to Sandsfield in earlier days. It would feature locks , while the channel would be wide by deep, and would cost ¬£75,392. A link to Newcastle upon Tyne could be built on a smaller scale, and another link could be built along the valley of the Eden to serve slate quarries near Ullswater. His plan was accepted, money was raised locally, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1819, which authorised the Carlisle Canal to raise ¬£80,000 in capital, and an extra ¬£40,000 if required. The chairman of the committee, Dr John Heysham, suggested they look at other canals before starting work, and visits were made to the Lancaster Canal and the Forth and Clyde Canael. =Construction= The committee appointed Chapman as consulting engineer, but who held the position of resident engineer is less clear. Richard Buck had helped Chapman with the initial surveys, and it appears that his brother Henry fulfilled that role at the start of the project. Contracts to build the entire canal had been awarded by early 1820, but relationships between Chapman, Buck and the committee were not good, and the committee asked Thomas Ferrier from the Forth and Clyde Canal to oversee the works in March. Buck was not happy with this and resigned in July. but Richard Buck stayed on, effectively working for Ferrier. Chapman was not happy with this situation, and in November 1822, when most of the work had been completed, criticised Ferrier's workmanship, and recommended that Buck should be allowed to complete the canal. The committee took exception to this and dismissed him. Two months later, just before the canal was due to open, they dismissed Buck as well, although he did not leave and stayed on until May 1823. The canal was long, had a surface width of and was deep. At Fisher's Cross, a basin had been built, which was connected to the Solway Firth by a sea lock with a long timber jetty. Seven more locks raised the level of the canal by , and at Carlisle there was a second basin, , complete with wharves and a warehouse. The locks were long and wide, and water supply was provided by a reservoir on Mill Beck near Grinsdale. The sea lock was built so that its top was at the same level as high tides on the lowest neap tides, and there was a second lock nearby, which maintained the level of the canal at above the level of the highest tides. Beyond the two locks, the canal ran on a level for , and then the remaining six locks were grouped together in the next , after which the canal ran level again to reach Carlisle. Facilities at Carlisle were improved in 1838 by the construction of a timber pond below the basin. There were no fixed bridges on the route, so that it could be used by coastal vessels, and where crossings were required, they were built using two-leaved drawbridges, similar in style to those on the Forth and Clyde Canal. While Paget-Tomlinson and Hadfield & Biddle agree on the number of locks, Priestley, writing in 1831, suggests that there were two locks immediately above the sea lock, each with a rise of , and that the top level was above the level of the sea lock, this being the level reached by an abnormally high tide which was recorded in January 1796. He also says that there were two basins between the locks, known as the Upper and Lower Solway basins, and that the six locks further along raised the level by . The committee had succeeded in raising ¬£70,600 of the authorised capital, most of it coming from local people. To complete the project, they had borrowed around ¬£10,000, so the total cost was just over the estimated ¬£80,000. The committee consisted of nine proprietors, each of whom was required to hold at least ten shares, and they were to be elected annually. =Operation= The committee set about encouraging trade on the canal, and built a timber yard at Carlisle. Shortly afterwards, the Treasury altered the rules on coastal taxes, and repealed the duties on coal, stone and slate carried between Whitehaven and Carlisle. However, no one could be found to run a trade in coal, so in June the committee sent a boat called Mary to Harrington to fetch some, which they then sold, but decided not to run the coal trade directly. Towing of boats on the canal was organised by a group of men call Trackers, and by the end of the year, tolls of ¬£928 had been collected. In 1824, they kick-started a trade in bricks, by importing two boat loads, which they sold from the quays at Carlisle. Suspecting that the reservoir might not be adequate for the number of boats using the canal, they built a feeder from the river, with a water wheel to raise the water to the level of the canal. There were attempts to avoid the tolls on the canal, with some ships carrying timber waiting for favourable tides, and using the river to reach Rockcliffe, where the timber was loaded into carts. In 1825 the Carlisle & Liverpool Steam Navigation Company were looking to start a passenger service from Liverpool, and asked for an exclusive berth for their ship. The committee paid for a new berth, the cost to be repaid by the Navigation Company over the next ten years, and also bought a second-hand packet boat called Bailie Nicol Jarvie, to ferry the passengers from Port Carlisle to Carlisle. They leased it to a local innkeeper, Alexander Cockburn, for ¬£30 per year, and the service began on 1 July 1826. The steamer service to Liverpool began at about the same time, although the packet boat only ran in the summer months to begin with. As well as passengers, the steamer also carried goods, and these were carried along the canal by lighters. The Solway Hotel opened in Port Carlisle soon afterwards. In August 1824, there were public meetings in Newcastle, to consider again the idea of a canal to Carlisle, or possibly a railway. William Chapman, who had surveyed a route for a canal in 1796, suggested that the route was also suitable for a railway, and was asked to cost both options. He quoted ¬£888,000 for a canal and ¬£252,488 for a railway. A company was created to build a railway, although they did not obtain an Act of Parliament until 1829. There was support in Carlisle, and an agreement was reached that the railway would terminate at the canal basin. It opened in stages from 19 July 1836, reaching Redheugh, Gateshead on 18 June 1838, and Newcastle the following year. Through traffic boosted the profits of the canal. Tolls had averaged ¬£2,905 for the three years to 1835, but by 1840, they had reached ¬£6,605. Receipts from the packet boat had also climbed steadily, to ¬£829 in 1850, and the company had been able to pay dividends to shareholders, starting at 1 per cent in 1833, and rising to 4 per cent by 1839. Further progress was made. In early 1832, several shipowners had placed buoys in the Solway Firth, to mark the channel, and started collecting funds from ships to cover their costs. They asked the canal company to take over responsibility for this, and they did so. In 1833, the Carlisle and Annan Navigation Company asked for a berth at Port Carlisle for their new service to Annan and Liverpool, and one was built. With arrival of the railway imminent, the committee asked William Houston, of the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal to arrange the construction of a faster packet boat, and the Arrow entered service in 1834. The company purchased an ice-breaker, which enabled the packet service to run all year from the winter of 1836-37. The old packet boat, Bailie Nicol Jarvie, was sold for ¬£7 12 shillings (¬£7.60), and the company also started an omnibus service between Carlisle basin and the town centre. To improve the water supply, William Fairbairn was paid ¬£1,391 to construct a new waterwheel and pumps, and these were commissioned in 1835. However, they pumps did not work as well as anticipated, and Harvey's of Hoyle provided a steam engine and pumps in 1838, at a cost of ¬£3,700. These supplemented the waterwheel, being used when river levels were too low to drive it, or when the reservoir needed filling. The Admiralty surveyed the Solway Firth in 1835, and were asked for advice on buoys to mark the channel. The berths at Port Carlisle were dredged, and plans for an inner and outer dock were formulated. John Hartley of Liverpool had produced designs by November 1835, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1836. It allowed the company to borrow another ¬£40,000, and included powers to light and buoy the Solway Firth. Hartley's plans to start enclosing the dock area in June 1836 were delayed due to objections from Lord Lonsdale, who had rights over the foreshore, but work eventually started in August 1838. The purchase of eighteen new buoys was begun in May 1837, and they were installed during 1838. A lightship was built in 1840, and a lighthouse was constructed at Lees Scar near Silloth. =Railways= Traffic on the canal increased with the arrival of the railway at Carlisle basin. This included coal from Lord Carlisle's mines, and also from the Blenkinsopp Coal Company, who were based at Greenhead. Te company decided to carry coal in barges, which were towed by a tug when operating on the Solway Firth, although they had initially considered using boats or rafts onto which the loaded railway wagons would be shunted. A second packet boat was obtained from Paisley in July 1838, and tolls on the canal and railway were reduced in 1838 and 1839, to encourage through traffic. The increase in traffic was sufficient that the men who worked as bridge and lock keepers were paid extra amounts in view of their increased workload. However, the boom did not last long, and the company found that it was in competition with the railways. The Lancaster and Carlisle Railway was authorised in 1844, and was a direct threat to the steamer service and canal. The Maryport and Carlisle Railway had been authorised in 1837, but opening was delayed until 1845 by financial difficulties. It was extended to Whitehaven in early 1847 by the opening of the Whitehaven Junction Railway, and at the end of the year the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway opened. The Caledonian Railway opened in February 1848, running northwards from Carlisle to Scotland. By the autumn of 1846, the company was seriously considering converting the canal into a railway, and commissioned a report, which was produced in February 1847, and suggested the idea was feasible. They entertained the directors of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway in May, and in July were instructed by the shareholders to begin negotiations with that company, or another of the railway companies with lines to Carlisle. Little progress was made, and the canal company and steamboat companies looked at ways to reduce costs, and thus lower their tolls. Despite the sale of the packet boat Clarence in 1847, and the withdrawal of the steamer service from Port Carlisle to Annan, passenger traffic remained good, but in April 1850 was affected by the introduction of cheaper fares to Liverpool, using the railway from Carlisle to Whitehaven, and a much shorter sea voyage from there to Liverpool. In March 1852 the company decided that the best option was to convert the canal into a railway, raised some money from shareholders and loan holders, and sought an Act of Parliament. Work began in June 1853, although the Act was not obtained until 3 August. An omnibus service was used to ferry passengers between Carlisle and the steamers at Port Carlisle, and the canal closed on 1 August 1853. The Act wound up the canal company, and created the Port Carlisle Dock and Railway Company. In less than a year, construction was completed, with the line opening for goods traffic on 12 May 1854. Passenger services followed on 22 June. A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 16 July 1855, to authorise the Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway and Dock Company, with a working capital of ¬£165,000. Their railway left the Port Carlisle line at and ran to , where a dock to rival Maryport was constructed. The North British Railway leased both lines in 1862, and they all merged in 1880. The stub from Drumburgh to became known as the Port Carlisle Branch, and lasted until 1 June 1932, when it closed.

It aims to create a comprehensive account of all deaths within a determined scope, usually bound by time and location. At minimum, casualty recording typically involves documenting the date and location of a violent incident; the number of people killed; the means of violence or category of weapon used; and the party responsible. Casualty recording differs from casualty tracking, which is conducted exclusively by military actors to track the effects of their operations on the civilian population for the purpose of improving their procedures and mitigating their effects. A defining feature of casualty recording is that it is victim-centric and seeks to establish the identity of every fatality including name, age, sex, and other relevant demographic details. Where relevant to the conflict context, this may also include ethnicity and religious or political affiliation. However, depending on the aims and resources of the organisation conducting the recording, a particular initiative may record only a specific subset of deaths. Subsets may include, for example, deaths caused by a specific belligerent or weapons type, or deaths of a particular segment of the population, such as children. Casualty recording focuses on documenting direct deaths from armed violence. It does not normally include deaths caused by the indirect or reverberating effects of conflict. Some casualty recording initiatives document injuries as well as deaths. Casualty records may overlap with, or operate in conjunction with, records of persons who have gone missing during a conflict or period of violence.  Aims and uses  Practitioners have different aims and motivations for conducting casualty recording. Typically these are grounded in considerations relating to international humanitarian law or human rights law. Casualty records have also been used to support some humanitarian disarmament initiatives. The purported aims of casualty records include: * Recognising the dignity and rights of victims and their families, including the right to life and the right to the truth. This work often overlaps with efforts to trace missing people in situations of armed conflict. * Supporting accountability and peace building processes including memorialisation, transitional justice and criminal prosecutions for war crimes or crimes against humanity. These activities can play an important role in reducing cycles of violence and promoting community reconciliation. * Supporting the protection of civilians by providing information to reduce unintended consequences of military activities and improve humanitarian response planning. *Informing media reporting and policy makers on conflict dynamics. * Informing, monitoring and improving protection measures aimed at specific populations affected by armed violence including children, women, persons with disabilities, journalists, health workers and older persons. * Enabling victims' families to receive reparation, compensation and access to services, as well as inheritance rights. * Identifying the unintended and unacceptable harm to civilians caused by the use of certain weapons. Casualty data on anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions helped drive international efforts to ban these weapons, and information on the effects of explosive weapons in populated areas is informing efforts to curb their use. Memorial of victims of Kosovo war History The twenty-first century practice of monitoring and publishing detailed online information on the human casualties of armed conflicts is sometimes associated with the Iraq Body Count project that started monitoring Iraqi deaths in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Iraq Body Count estimates, the 2004 and 2006 Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties and the ORB survey of Iraq War casualties led to several years of academic debate over the accuracy of the various surveys of the total casualties of the Iraq War.  Methodology and standards  Approaches to casualty recording vary depending on the context, purpose and resources of the organisation responsible. In 2016, Standards for Casualty Recording were published by the UK-based NGO Every Casualty Worldwide, in an effort to harmonise approaches across the field and promote best practice. The data gathered by a casualty recording project will generally be stored in an electronic or paper-based database, but there is no standard format for sharing or publishing the final results. Some casualty recorders, such as Iraq Body Count project and Yemen Data Project, make their records publicly available online and searchable. Casualty recorders have also published books of their records, such as the Kosovo Memory Book and Lost Lives (relating to deaths from the conflict in Northern Ireland). Lost Lives was subsequently reproduced as a documentary film in 2019. Casualty data may also be used to produce digital or physical memorials of those who died, as in the case of Remembering The Ones We Lost, which memorialises individuals who were killed or went missing during the conflict in South Sudan.  Practitioners  Casualty recording is frequently conducted by civil society organisations in the absence of official recording processes led by state entities. In some armed conflict situations, public services normally involved in recording deaths (including hospitals and other health services, as well as coroners and police forces) are no longer functioning effectively. There may also be political reasons why state authorities do not publish or share information on conflict related deaths. Some internationally mandated entities, including UN peacekeeping missions or commissions of inquiry, conduct casualty recording as part of their broader work. Examples of organisations which conduct, or have conducted, casualty recording include: * Action on Armed Violence, UK * Airwars * Al Mezan Center for Human Rights * B'Tselem for Israel and the Israeli-occupied territories *Centre for Border Studies - Jindal School of International Affairs, India *Colombian Campaign Against Landmines (Colombia Sin Minas) *Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), Northern Ireland * Conflict Analysis Resource Centre, Colombia * Crisis Tracker * Forensic Anthropology Foundation of Guatemala * Humanitarian Law Centre, Kosovo * Humanitarian Law Centre, Serbia * Humanitarian Outcomes ‚Äì Aid Worker Security Database *Iniskoy for Peace and Democracy Organisation, Somalia * INSEC in Nepal *International Commission on Missing Persons * Iraq Body Count project, ORB survey of Iraq War casualties, Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties *Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor *Lost Lives, Northern Ireland * Nigeria Watch * Omeria Organisation * Pakistan Body Count * Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies * Palestinian Centre for Human Rights * Somali Human Rights Association (SOHRA) *Surveillance System for Attacks on Healthcare (SSA), World Health Organisation * Syria Justice and Accountability * Syrian Centre for Statistics and Research * Syrian Network for Human Rights * The Bureau of Investigative Journalism * The Human Rights Center Georgia * United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the 2018 protests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory * United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan * United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq * Violations Documentation Center in Syria * Yemen Data Project  Non-conflict casualty recording  Although casualty recording typically relates to deaths resulting from armed conflict, specialised casualty recording projects not directly related to armed violence also exist. These include projects focused on recording deaths from gender based violence and deaths or disappearances of migrants, homeless people and other vulnerable groups. Examples of such initiatives include: *Committee to Protect Journalists, recording deaths of journalists worldwide * Dying Homeless, recording deaths of homeless people in the UK, by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism *Gun Violence Archive, recording all gun violence incidents, including deaths, in the USA. * Missing Migrants, tracking deaths along international migratory routes, by the International Organisation of Migration * Los feminicidios en M√©xico, recording deaths from gender based violence in Mexico References Category:War-related deaths Category:Civilian casualties ","title":"Casualty recording"},{"id":"62192572","text":"Cessnock Castle is a 15th-century keep greatly enlarged into a baronial mansion, about south east of Galston, East Ayrshire, Scotland, and south of the River Irvine.Coventry, Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland.

She worked alongside her mother, Mary Church Terrell, in the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs and the White House pickets during demonstrations made by the National Woman's Party. Early life and education Phyllis Terrell was born on April 2, 1898 in Washington, DC to Mary Church Terrell, an activist for civil rights and suffrage, and Robert Heberton Terrell, the first Black municipal court judge in Washington D.C. She was named after Phyllis Wheatley, the first African- American author of a book of poetry. The family adopted Mary Terrell's ten- year-old niece, also named Mary, in 1905. Terrell graduated from Wilberforce University and became a teacher. Terrell continued her studies at Howard University in the College of Music. She was one of the most promising students in the College of Music, commended for her natural talent at playing piano.  Activism  The National Association of Colored Women, or NAWC, was founded in 1896 by black reformers like Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and Harriet Tubman. It eventually became the largest federation of local black women's clubs, and Mary Church Terrell, Terrell‚Äôs mother, became the first president. The NACW advocated to improve the lives of African Americans. Their motto is ‚ÄúLifting as We Climb,‚Äù which embodies their mission of advocating for women‚Äôs rights along with improving the status of African Americans. Witnessing her mother's work prompted Terrell to join the National Association of Colored Women.National Council of Negro Women Headquarters Frederick Douglass National Historic Site Terrell, along with her mother, picketed the White House during the National Woman's Party demonstrations that called on President Woodrow Wilson to support a women's suffrage amendment. As Black women, Terrell and her mother were excluded from the vote when the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed. However, Terrell and her mother joined the National Women‚Äôs Party to get Silent Sentinel pins for picketing the White House. In August 1939, Terrell and her mother Mary visited San Francisco and Oakland on a tour of California. They visited the home of Irene Belle Ruggles, the president of the California Association of Colored Women and the Association of Colored Women of San Francisco. At that time, Terrell listened to her mother give a speech commending the hospitable people they met on their trip and the glories of Treasure Island. Terrell became the postmaster for new generations of suffragists and civil rights organizations. In this role, she assisted historians and scholars regarding the plight of African Americans and worked closely with National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. Terrell watched the launching of the SS Harriet Tubman in 1944 with a group of women from the National Council of Negro Women.  Fredrick Douglass Home  In 1962, Phyllis Terrell succeeded in getting the Frederick Douglass Home in Washington, DC declared a National Shrine by an Act of Congress. The Terrells' summer home on the Chesapeake Bay in Highland Beach, Maryland, was next door to the home that Major Charles R. Douglass built for his father, Frederick Douglass, in 1893. Highland Beach was a regular summer vacation destination for educator Booker T. Washington; poets Langston Hughes and Paul Laurence Dunbar; pioneering Black Congressmen John Mercer Langston and Blanche Kelso Bruce, and generations of the Douglass family.1919 Letter from Phyllis Terrell to mother Mary Church Terrell  Personal Life  Terrell married first Lieutenant William C. Goines in 1930, and later married Lathall DeWitt Langston. Terrell did not have any of her own children. However, her second husband had two sons and one daughter. Phyllis and her mother, suffragette, Mary Church Terrell were in contact for almost 40 years through letters where Terrell addressed her mother as \\"My dearest mother,\\" and signed the letters \\"Your little daughter, Phyllis\\" or \\"Lovingly, Phippie\\".

It aims to develop a series of independent but connected democratic institutions to empower workers and residents of Jackson, particularly to address the needs of poor, unemployed, black or Latino residents. The development of Cooperation Jackson was heavily inspired by the Mondragon Corporation in Spain, which is also a federation of cooperatives, and by historical cooperative movements as described in works by W. E. B. Du Bois and in the book Collective Courage by Jessica Gordon Nembhard.  History  Cooperation Jackson plans to carry out a vision of a radically democratic city of interconnected cooperatives and supporting institutions. Although the city of Jackson was already home to the Mississippi Association of Cooperatives, before Cooperation Jackson, there were not many existing cooperative businesses. Kali Akuno, co-founder and co-director of Cooperation Jackson, describes a goal of bringing a strong focus of cooperative economics to an urban context, as opposed to the rural context of existing agricultural and utility co-ops. The organization has attempted to work within and outside of the government to achieve its goals. It has had to fight off anti- democratic measures by the Mississippi state legislators including austerity measures, an attempted takeover of Jackson‚ÄìMedgar Wiley Evers International Airport, and an attempt to pass a bill to hand control of the city government over to the governor. The organizers also struggle with working in an economically depressed city in the poorest state in the United States.  Jackson-Kush Plan  Kali Akuno has described the network as a key part of enacting the Jackson-Kush Plan. The plan, which was developed by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and the Jackson People's Assembly, involves building a strong base of community wealth, stability, racial equity, and economic democracy in Jackson. It has three planks, which are the \\"building of a broad- based solidarity economy, the building of people's assemblies, and the building of an independent black political party.\\" Organizers behind Cooperation Jackson believe that a solidarity economy rooted in democratic principles is a core requirement of developing the community's capacity and vision in making meaningful change. The direct democracy of people's assemblies and local government electoral strategy are designed to both benefit and benefit from a strong cooperative system.  Institutions  Several cooperatives already exist as part of the Cooperation Jackson network. These include the lawn care business The Green Team, the organic vegetable farm Freedom Farms, and the print shop The Center for Community Production, which also operates a 3D printer. These cooperatives try to alleviate causes of poverty and discrimination while operating in an ecologically sustainable manner. A cooperative incubator exists, called the Balagoon Center. Cooperation Jackson also owns about three hectares of land which it operates as a community land trust.

The work of the Leisners is widely acknowledged as one of the most important contributions to the study of the megalithic phenomenon in Iberia. They produced numerous publications on this topic, almost all published jointly, which remain the classic reference works on the Portuguese and Spanish megalithic. They developed a systematic method of research based on direct observation, drawings and photographs, coupled with the discussion of available sources. Over several decades, they visited, studied and described hundreds of megalithic monuments throughout Spain and Portugal. Vera Leisner (born Amanda Vera de la Camp) was born in New York on 4 February 1885 and died in Hamburg on 31 May 1972. Her husband, who was fifteen years older, was born in Kiel on 2 September 1870 and died in Stuttgart on 20 September 1957. Early lives Vera Leisner's father was a businessman in the import-export trade and was based in New York at the time of her birth. Her mother died in childbirth at the age of 25 when Vera was two years old. She then lived with her grandmother in Hamburg for eight years until her father remarried, when she returned to New York for one year, also visiting Japan. In 1898 the family returned to Hamburg, where Vera attended a local school and then a boarding school in Eisenach. As usual for girls at the time, the focus of her education was the study of music and painting. Georg Leisner's father came from a merchant family in Eckernf√∂rde to the northwest of Kiel. His mother came from an old family of Kiel master craftsmen. Georg spent his childhood in Kiel, where he completed pre-university studies in 1891. In the same year he joined the Bavarian Army. In 1900 and 1901 he took part in the campaigns that followed the Boxer Rebellion in China and in 1904 and 1905 was involved in the \\"war\\" against the Herero people in German South West Africa, now Namibia. The couple married on 2 September 1909 and lived in Munich. At that time, archaeological research was far from their thoughts. During the First World War Vera worked as a nurse in a military hospital in Munich, while her husband was an officer at the Front. After the war Georg retired from the army at the age of 48 with the rank of Lieutenant colonel and the two purchased a small farm in the village of Hohenberg an der Eger in Bavaria, although they had no prior experience of farming. In 1924-25 they undertook a seven-month trip to Italy, selling the farm on their return. The trip to Italy seems to have been the spur for their interest in archaeology. Professional development Between 1924 and 1928 Georg Leisner collaborated with the Frobenius Institute of Cultural Morphology at the University of Frankfurt and in 1926, possibly also with Vera, took part in Leo Frobenius's eighth expedition to Africa, to the Nubian desert, to examine the architecture and document rock paintings of the area. Returning to Bavaria after the trip to Italy, the couple made acquaintance with Hugo Obermaier, a distinguished prehistorian and anthropologist and professor at the Complutense University of Madrid. He suggested that Georg study prehistory and he enrolled at the University of Munich in 1927. However, he soon moved to the Department of Prehistory and Early History at the University of Marburg, where the first German chair of prehistoric archaeology was created in 1928. Vera also wanted to enrol but had never completed her bachelor's degree and first needed to comply with its requirements. By the time she entered the university Georg was already studying megalithic tombs and had developed a plan to do his doctorate on such tombs on the Iberian Peninsula. They travelled together to northwest Spain and Portugal for seven months in 1929-30 to carry out the research, Vera doing drawings of the graves and also learning photography. In 1928, at the age of 62, Georg earned his doctorate on megalithic tombs in the Spanish region of Galicia, under the supervision of Gero von Merhart. Since Vera had not yet graduated, they were faced with a choice of whether she should first obtain a degree or begin field work with her husband immediately. They chose the latter. They travelled for seven months in 1929 and 1930 through the Iberian Peninsula, including the Algarve in Portugal, where they visited the Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar. This was where the idea of a series of publications on the megalithic tombs of the Iberian Peninsula is believed to have emerged. Vera's lack of a doctorate and the fact that, at the time, archaeology was a male-dominated discipline, may explain why, in later life, Georg was very concerned to secure her rights to their work after his death. He was fully aware that fellow archaeologists considered her to be his assistant rather than his partner. Working life The Leisners travelled three times to the south of the Iberian Peninsula up to 1934 to study and document all megalithic tombs in Iberia. Initially they carried out their work without any financial support. While they received advice and moral support from Hugo Obermaier, who at the time was living in Madrid, and from Gero von Merhart at the University of Marburg, only the second and third journeys to Spain were funded by the forerunner of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Initially working in southern Spain, they began systematic mapping of the megalithic tombs of Andalusia. In the process they also met the most important contemporary specialists on the Neolithic of the Iberian Peninsula. They made contact with the Belgian-Spanish archaeologist Luis Siret y Cels and with the ailing British archaeologist George Edward Bonsor Saint Martin whose widow subsequently gave them access to his records. While working in Portugal they met with the Portuguese archaeologist Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos, who had also been working in Galicia. Fieldwork in southern Spain was followed in 1932 by research in northwestern Spain and in Portugal. Here they found that the results of earlier excavations remained unpublished and plans of the tombs were missing. In the couple's travels over many years they visited the sites of megalithic graves, drew new plans and discovered many hundreds of sites that had been completely unknown. With limited resources they had to rely on their network of contacts to provide local connections and logistical support and accommodation for the numerous journeys made by train, bus, car, horse wagon, donkey, mule, bicycle or on foot. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War they were forced to return to Germany, where they produced the first volume, \\"The South,\\" of the planned work, \\"The Megalithic Tombs of the Iberian Peninsula\\" (Die Megalithgr√§ber der Iberischen Halbinsel), which was published in the middle of World War II. It covered the Spanish provinces of Guadalajara, Teruel, Valencia, Murcia, Almeria, Granada, Malaga, Cordoba, Seville, Cadiz and Huelva as well as the Portuguese region of the Algarve. Its impact was initially limited due to the fact that it was in German, there were distribution constraints and many copies were lost at the end of the war. The war also made it difficult to get an exit visa from Germany, which they did not obtain until 1943. This enabled them to carry out fieldwork in Portugal. They were in Portugal when they learned that their Munich apartment had been destroyed by an Allied bombing raid, with the loss of important documents and research material. As a consequence they decided to stay in Portugal's capital, Lisbon, where they lived until their respective deaths. What was expected to be a two-month visit, for which they had a visa, was repeatedly extended, but not without some problems with the Portuguese security authorities. This was a time of considerable economic hardship but the Instituto de Alta Cultura (Institute of High Culture) of the Ministry of Education gave them some research assignments and, for a time, they also had a scholarship from the Siemens company. However, the available funds only allowed them to carry out fieldwork for one or two months in a year. In 1945 the Director of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Coimbra made a formal invitation to Georg to work with the university, which he accepted. However, the invitation had to be cancelled because the government did not approve the contract as Germany, close to surrender at the end of the Second World War, did not have a ‚Äúlegally organized internal government before whom the subjects of that Nation [could] be held responsible for any public act‚Äù. The Madrid office of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) was reopened in 1954. This led to a grant to the Leisners from the German Research Foundation (DFG), which enabled them to disseminate their findings in Spanish and Portuguese and to publish the second volume of their work on megalithic tombs in Iberia in 1959. They were in regular correspondence with leading archaeologists, including the Australian, V. Gordon Childe, who recognised, in particular, their work on the Bell Beaker Culture. After the death of Georg in 1958, Vera, who in Georg's later years had already been carrying out the bulk of the research work, continued the research in collaboration with leading Portuguese archaeologists. She was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Freiburg in Germany in 1960. She published the third volume in 1965. While preparing the fourth volume, she died in Hamburg in 1972. She had been professionally active until close to her death. In 1969 she had been part of a team excavating the Praia das Macas site near Colares in Portugal. Scientific estate The unfinished fourth volume was finally published in 1998, following considerable input from Philine Kalb. Vera Leisner donated her scientific estate to the Madrid office of the DAI with the special request that it should remain in Portugal. It initially formed the basis for the establishment of a DAI branch in Lisbon. When this closed in 1999, the collection was transferred by loan to the Portuguese state. Today, the ‚ÄúLeisner Archive‚Äù is housed in the Dire√ß√£o-Geral do Patrim√≥nio Cultural (DGPC) at the Palace of Ajuda in Lisbon. The archive includes around 49.500 documents, nearly 19.000 written and 30.500 drawings and photographs that were accumulated by the couple during their research on the Iberian Peninsula. Most are from 1943 onwards, although some earlier items were also found, including their wedding invitation. Some remain uncatalogued as, in spite of the precision with which the Leisners did their work, some photographs are unidentified and there are photographs of monuments where the location is unknown. The utility of the collection is enhanced by the fact that the Leisners kept a copy of every letter they wrote. With support from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation the items were listed, catalogued, indexed, treated and scanned in 2012-13 to make them available for web dissemination. It is rare today to find anything related to surface megalithism in Portugal that the Leisners have not already identified. In Portugal alone they identified some 4000 monuments. The archive allows researchers to appreciate the systematic way they compiled and published information, both from their own fieldwork and from other sources. This made it possible to understand their reasoning. Besides photographs, their drawing of plans of tombs (mostly dolmen) can still be used today. Some are especially useful as the structures have since been destroyed. The same observations can be made about photographs and drawings of artifacts, grouped by each tomb studied. This systematic approach also helped to situate Portuguese archaeology within broader European discussions about megalithic tombs.

It was designed by Edward Maufe and built in 1938‚Äì39, with later additions. History Goodrington underwent major expansion during the early part of the 20th-century, resulting in a small mission church being erected in circa 1930 as a temporary measure to provide much needed church accommodation. Later in February 1937, the vicar of Paignton, Rev. B. Montague Dale, launched an appeal to raise ¬£10,000 for the construction of two new, permanent churches in his parish. It was intended to raise the sum over a period of five years, but the appeal successfully raised ¬£5,000 in six months, allowing construction of a permanent church for Goodrington, St George's, to begin in 1938. The church was designed by Edward Maufe and cost ¬£7,000 to build. The site was donated by Colonel H. Browse Scaife. The original construction work of 1938‚Äì39 was made up of the tower, chancel and transepts. St George's was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter, the Right Rev. Charles Curzon, on 25 March 1939. In 1957‚Äì62, the nave and sacristy were built according to a simplified version of Maufe's original drawings. A church hall and ancillary facilities were added in 1963‚Äì65.

It was based on the seminal Dartmouth BASIC, including the Fifth Edition's string variables and powerful commands for matrix manipulation. In contrast to the compile-and-go Dartmouth BASIC, Extended BASIC was an interpreter. To this, Extended BASIC added substring manipulation using array slicing, which was common on BASICs of the era, found on HP Time- Shared BASIC, North Star BASIC, Atari BASIC and others. This contrasts with the Microsoft BASIC style which uses string functions like , and thus makes porting string code somewhat difficult. Data General later purchased rights to a much-expanded BASIC which was released as Data General Business Basic. This added powerful database functionality and largely replaced Extended BASIC on DG platforms. Description =Basic math= The internal floating point number format normally used two 16-bit words for a total of 32-bits, stored least significant bit first. Bit 0 was the sign, 1 through 7 was the exponent stored in excess-64 format, and 8 through 31 the mantissa stored as hexadecimal digits. Numbers could alternately used a double-precision format that extended the mantissa only, adding another 32-bits. That meant the double-precision format did not extend the range of numbers that could be stored, only the accuracy of those numbers. Possible numbers ranged from 5.4x10^-79 to -7.2x10^75. Numbers with less than six digits were displayed as decimals, while those with more were displayed in exponent format. Variable names could consist of a single letter, or a letter and a single digit. Two- letter names were not allowed. Arrays could be in 1 (array) or 2 (matrix) dimensions, and the lower bound was always 1. As was common at the time, variables with no defaulted to a 1-D array of 10 elements. Confusingly, if a variable was ed, it was not the same as a variable with the same name that had not been ed; and might be the same or different variables depending on how they were created. Mathematics operators were the standard set, with the addition of a unary plus. Relational operators for comparisons were also the standard set, there was no for not-equals as found in some contemporary BASICs. =Matrix math= Extended BASIC added the suite of matrix math operations from Dartmouth BASIC's Fifth Edition. These were, in essence, macros that performed operations that would otherwise be accomplished with loops. The system included a number of pre-rolled matrixes, like for a zero- matrix, for a matrix of all 1's, for the identity matrix. Most mathematical operations were supported, for instance, multiplies every element in A by 2. takes the determinant, and inverts it. =Strings= String literals (constants) were entered between double-quotes. Characters within strings could be escaped by placing their ASCII value between angle-brakets, for instance, String variables, like their numeric counterparts, consisted of only a single letter, or one letter and one digit. As is the case for all variables in Extended BASIC, string variables were normally allocated ten spaces, but could be extended up to a maximum of 32 k with an explicit . Because the array syntax was used to declare the length of the string, string arrays were not possible. Assigning a string to a variable that was too small too hold it resulted in any excess being truncated. String manipulation was carried out using array slicing syntax. referred to the substring from position 10 to the end of the string, while referred to characters 10 through 20. Concatenation used the comma, so added B$ to the end of A$. This was an uncommon syntax, even when it was being introduced, most BASICs using slicing used that for concatenation as well, for instance, would append B$ at the end of A$, while those using string functions, like Microsoft BASIC, already widely used the plus sign for this operation. This syntax change was because Extended BASIC allowed math operators to be applied to strings, up to the first non-numeric character. For instance, would put 3579 into A, without the need to explicitly convert them to numerics, normally handled with the function in most dialects. Non-numerics were simply ignored, put 1234 into A. Extended BASIC lacked the command from Dartmouth that converted an entire string to or from ASCII values in an array, for instance, which results in B being assigned 10 numbers, each one an ASCII value. =Statements= Extended BASIC is otherwise similar to Dartmouth and Microsoft BASIC in the variety of commands it supports and their syntax. Exceptions include instead of , instead of (which was not common anyway). Two additions were which allowed errors to be trapped, a feature that became common on other BASICs, and which allowed the break key (escape in this case) to be trapped as well. was similar to , but allowed a single line to be re-run after a break, instead of continuing the entire program. set the time limit for statements to respond, which was a \\"timed input\\" otherwise identical to . Extended BASIC added a variety of immediate mode editing statements that are not really part of the language per se. These included to remove a range of lines from a program, to read the contents of a text file into the program, and . was similar to , but read the lines from the card reader. It also added a number of statements for dealing with the underlying file system, including which lists files in the user's directory and which does the same with wildcards, which printed the name of that directory, and for the program code, and , and , which printed the free space. was like , but sent the file to th card punch. printed the attributes of a given file. Other operating system- related statements included to print a list of logged-in users, to bother them, to set the right margin (page width), and to print the memory used by the program, the opposite of what would be returned in MS BASIC with . =Functions= Functions closely matched Dartmouth and Microsoft BASIC, with a few additions. returned an numeric value encoding the positions of the front-panel switches. returned whether or not file x had reached the end-of- file. returned the position of B$ within A$, anywhere after the optional position Z, similar to the MS-standard .

Today, coffee shops serve as a niche within their urban cultures. While it was introduced earlier in history, in the sixteen and seventeenth centuries by Dutch and Portuguese traders, it gained popularity rapidly at the turn of the twentieth century. It supports the social aspects of Japan, serving both as a space to connect but also to alleviate oneself from social pressures. Coffee is also defined by class interactions and classicist behaviors and has economic influence through the mass amount of import of coffee and the mass consumption of coffee in Japan in its many different forms.  History  Japanese farm workers in Brazil working on coffee plantations Coffee first arrived in Japan via Dutch traders in 1700. The first shop opened in 1888 and was called Kahiichakan. It lasted five years before going bankrupt. In 1933, Tadao Ueshima founded Ueshima Tadao Shoten in Kobe. Ueshima has since been dubbed the \\"Father of Coffee in Japan\\". During World War II, the Japanese established a ban on coffee imports until 1950. In 1969, Ueshima re-invented and mass-produced the first canned coffee making it a commodity to be consumed anywhere. Some canned coffee brands include \\"Boss (produced by Suntory), Georgia (produced by Coca-Cola), Nescafe (produced by Nestl√©), and Roots (produced by Japan Tobacco)\\". Following its brief stint in the Meiji period, coffee wove its way back into the Japanese markets in the 1960s. During World War II coffee import was banned in Japan as they were in conflict with the influential west. To measure its growth in consumption, Japan imported 15,000 tonnes back in 1960. Today, the numbers total over 440,000 tonnes. Japan's spike in coffee consumption can be linked to its fascination with western cultures leading to large investments. Mr. Ueshima also played a large role in the establishment of the All Japanese Coffee Association in 1980. In the same year, Doutor Coffee opened the country's first chain furthering the consumption and turning coffee into a valuable economic resource. Part of Doutor's success was its on-the-go environment. This facilitated and encouraged people to take their coffee with them to work and to school. = Types of coffee shops = Tully's Coffee Smaller chains battle to stay afloat by being known for their individual traits. For example, Renoir is recognized by its plug-in and wireless access for customers. Another factor is smoking and as some customers appreciate a smoke and coffee, others despise the thought of smoking altogether. Smaller shops can better cater to the locals in terms of allowing smoking while larger chains like Starbucks, must follow company rules and ban it. Bigger chains like McDonald's and Starbucks are rooted in the west and have pushed themselves upon the growing coffee market in Japan through storefronts and stands. Big or small, they both have been heavily influenced by the west. Smaller chains like Boss and Roots enlisted the help of prominent Americans Tommy Lee Jones (Boss) and Brad Pitt (Roots) to be their spokespeople and advertise for them. Bigger Chains like Starbucks emerged to capitalize on the new booming coffee industry in Japan. The first Starbucks opened in Ginza, Tokyo, in 1996. In 2005, they partnered with Suntory to sell their own canned coffee. Over time, Starbucks has grown to over 1,000 Japanese shops clustered around the cities. In response, McDonald's McCafe has sprouted up where instead of having a whole McDonald's store there is simply a stand selling McDonald's coffee. These standalone shops were officially established in 2007 and target coffee and small on-the- go treats. Tully's is a third foreign enterprise stemming out of Seattle, Washington. Its first shop opened in 1997, and grew to 513 by 2014.  Culture  thumb Coffee culture in Japan is one of the most unique observed globally. Due to the product's foreign origins, Japanese coffee culture is heavily connected to the identity of being foreign or western. This identity resulted in the beverage being banned during World War II. Coffee franchises such as the Western Starbucks are viewed and enjoyed in the same way as the Disneyland franchise in Japan. Concerning the Starbucks franchise, the first location outside of the US for Starbucks was Japan. In postwar Japan, Western products and goods were indicators of the new Japanese middle class. High-grade coffee equipment, as well as ground coffee, fell into this category. In the world of post-war Japan, jazz caf√©s and coffee they served were examples of Japan's efforts to modernize its culture and society in the vein of Western countries. Coffee shops were also cultural spots for progressive youths during the 1960s and 1970s, serving as meeting places for feminist movements and anti- government protests. Culture wise, coffee differs greatly from a traditional Japanese tea culture. Coffee is primarily viewed as Western wise as a solitary drink. Japan has a similar view of the beverage. In the 1960s and 1970s, coffee became popular with Japanese businessmen working alone in public. However, Japanese coffee also has a social element to it, but a radically different one than the social element associated with Japanese tea culture. In Japan, tea culture is a social, unifying event, expressed through the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The Japanese tea ceremony is an expression of hospitality and respect towards friends and guests. Coffee shops and coffee produced there serve a social function as well but a more disruptive social function. Coffee shops in Japan served as meeting places for social movements aimed at transforming and disrupting Japanese society during the 1970s and 1980s. These social movements include Japanese feminist groups and various anti-government movements. While serving as a symbol for Japanese businessmen as well as youthful activists, types of coffee products also serve to illustrate a divide between age groups. Per an article written through a collaboration between professors from the University of Hawaii and St. Andrews University in Osaka, instant coffee is viewed as common while ground and fresh coffee beans are viewed as luxury goods. Instant coffee is preferred by Japanese youth while ground coffee is enjoyed by successful middle-class Japanese adults.  International Connections  A Japanese-Brazilian stamp Japanese coffee production is an international affair. Coffee beans sold and roasted in Japan are primarily grown in countries such as Brazil, Indonesia and other countries with warm climates. Between 1908 and 1924, roughly 35,000 Japanese citizens emigrated to Brazil to work on coffee farms. These Japanese Brazilians would then bring coffee back to Japan. Japan‚Äôs coffee culture has also adopted the language and terminology used in English speaking Western countries such as roast and drop rather than create Japanese terms. Coffee brands in Japan are often marked by Western actors such as Brad Pitt and Tom Selleck, further indicating the product's foreign identity.  Economy  Historically, the economy of coffee shops boomed during the ‚Äúbubble economy‚Äù, in which there was great economic growth, particularly commercially, despite the unstable nature of this expansion. Currently, average revenue as of 2019 is 4075994.85 yen, which translates to $37,478 million in USD. The major type of coffee that is the most popular is instant coffee, which accrued a revenue of 3016157.88 yen, or 27,733 million in USD in 2019. The price of instant coffee per unit has gone up over the past couple of years, but roast coffee per unit has remained relatively stable. The large majority of coffee is consumed outside of the home, in bars and restaurants, proportional to in-home consumption. The largest company in the retail coffee segment is Nestl√©, and the biggest company in the in-home and out-of-home coffee is JAB Holdings, which is Luxembourg-based. There has been a steady increase in coffee revenue in Japan over the past decade. Globally, they are the third country from the most revenue generated from coffee.

See Henri Chr√©tien‚Äôs obituary, Le Monde (22 June 2000), p. 14. As a young man in his mid-twenties, Chr√©tien went against his father‚Äôs wishes, converted to Catholicism, and was baptized one Pentecost Sunday.See Emmanuel Housset, ‚ÄúMort du philosophe Jean-Louis Chr√©tien: Une philosophie de l‚Äôhumilit√© √† l‚Äô√©preuve de la Parole,‚Äù Centre d‚Äô√©tudes th√©ologiques de Caen (2 July 2019).

Tarek R. Dika and W. Chris Hackett (New York: Fordham University Press, 2016), 229. Henceforth, his faith would play a fundamental role in the formation not only of his life, but his unique brand of philosophy. Chr√©tien studied at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne in the late 1960s, and graduated with a first from the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (1971),See the Directory of the Association des Anciens √âl√®ves, √âl√®ves et Amis de l‚Äô√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure.

After teaching in secondary schools for a few years, he earned a doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1983.See Riquier, ‚ÄúMort du philosophe et po√®te Jean-Louis Chr√©tien.‚Äù Early encounters with the philosopher Henri Maldiney played a significant role in guiding his pursuit of the philosophical vocation.In 2013, Chr√©tien wrote, \\"Philosohically, an early encounter with Henri Maldiney introduced me, in an unforgettable way, to the thought of Heidegger...\\" See Jean-Louis Chr√©tien, \\"Attempting to Think Beyond Subjectivity,\\" 228. And see Housset, ‚ÄúMort du philosophe Jean-Louis Chr√©tien.‚Äù Friendship with the philosopher Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch was another factor, as well as a foundational encounter with the writings of Martin Heidegger.See Riquier, ‚ÄúMort du philosophe et po√®te Jean-Louis Chr√©tien.‚Äù He wrote a dissertation under Pierre Aubenque on ‚ÄúThe Hermeneutic of Obliquity in Neo-Platonism and Ancient Christianity.‚ÄùHerm√©neutique de l'obliquit√© dans le n√©oplatonisme et le christianisme antiques. After teaching for some years at the University of Cr√©teil, Chr√©tien was invited to teach at the Sorbonne, where he attained a chair in the history of the philosophy of Late Antiquity and the High Middle Ages.See Jean Duchesne, ‚ÄúJean-Louis Chr√©tien, po√®te-philosophe du Verbe divin,‚Äù Aleteia (8 July 2019).

Accessed 28 October 2019. Philosophical Approach Chr√©tien was a phenomenologist, but one who consciously practiced within a tradition: not only the phenomenological tradition of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau- Ponty,On Chr√©tien and the other ‚ÄúNew Phenomenologists‚Äù working in the tradition of Husserl and Heidegger, see J. Aaron Simmons and Bruce Ellis Benson, The New Phenomenology: A Philosophical Introduction (New York: Bloomsbury, 2013), 1-6. but the Christian-Platonic tradition of Augustine.On the bringing together of the Husserlian tradition with the Augustinian- Platonic, see Jeffrey Bloechl, ‚ÄúTranslator‚Äôs Introduction‚Äù to Jean-Louis Chr√©tien, The Unforgettable and the Unhoped For (New York: Fordham University Press, 2002), viii-xi. Throughout his works, he pursued deep engagements with philosophers and theologians in these traditions, as well as poets and novelists who could help him address the human questions in which he was interested. A chief research project of Chr√©tien‚Äôs through multiple publications was the experience of transcendence, what he called the ‚Äúexcess of the encounter with things, other, world, and God . . . this encounter requires, most imperatively, our response, and yet seems at the same time to prohibit it.‚Äù Jean-Louis Chr√©tien, ‚ÄúRetrospection,‚Äù in The Unforgettable and the Unhoped For (121). Many of his books trace different aspects of this basic picture, working out phenomenologies of personal encounter, response to the call of being (The Call and the Response), prayer (‚ÄúThe Wounded Word‚Äù), and art (Hand to Hand). Perhaps most centrally, his phenomenology finds its center in the experience of speech (The Ark of Speech), in which we are always trying to make the impossible response to the fundamental excess of reality. Thus, in a 2013 interview, Chr√©tien declared that \\"the guiding theme of all of my writings has been a phenomenology of speech as the place where all meaning comes to light and is received.\\"Interview with Camille Riquier in Jean-Louis Chr√©tien, \\"Attempting to Think Beyond Subjectivity,\\" 230.

It is Peck's third choreographed piece, the 422nd ballet choreographed for the New York City Ballet, and its creation was featured in the documentary Ballet 422. The costumes were designed by Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung with supervision from Marc Happel, with lighting by Mark Stanley The 20-minute piece features 18 dancers and premiered on January 13th, 2013.  Ballet  The piece is inspired by Peck's childhood in southern California. He drew this concept from the score, Bohuslav Martin≈Ø‚Äôs Sinfonietta la Jolla, which itself is a tribute to La Jolla, a suburb of San Diego. The choreography showcases Peck's ability to manipulate groups of dancers in complicated formations and patterns, as well as quick, detailed ballet phrasing. These elements are hallmarks of Peck's own personal style, but also reveal the influence of George Balanchine, founder of the New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet, where Peck underwent the majority of his ballet training. The cast consists of 15 members of the corps de ballet and 3 principle dancers. The ballet was premiered at the New York City Ballet in 2013 and was also performed by The National Ballet of Canada in June 2018. The ballet's plot, a love story, begins with a couple meeting on the beach, the male lead, wearing a dark blue and grey costume, bumping into his partner. The ballerina, wearing a white dress, then gets lost in a fast-moving crowd of the supporting dancers. When the couple is reunited, she embraces her counterpart and they lay down together, watching the ocean, made of the members of the corps. They go to sleep, but the female dancer wakes and swims into the ocean. Once the male dancer realizes she is gone, he dives in after her. The corps de ballet, an integral part of the piece, is led by the third principle dancer, a female dancer in a teal swimsuit, who plays the liveliest girl on the beach. = Costumes = The costumes were designed by Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung, also known as the design duo Reid & Harriet. The female dancers wear bathing suits, the men tees and shorts, to implant the dancers into the beachfront setting. To transform the dancers into the ocean, the dancers wear translucent blue tunics on top of their original costumes. The male lead is dressed in a dark blue-grey sleeveless boat-neck shirt and grey and blue striped shorts. His female counterpart wears an off-white V-neck dress. The other female principle dancer wears a light teal swimsuit with a chiffon halter-neck and a belt with a bow. = Music = Sinfonietta la Jolla was composed by Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, a Czech composer. The score was commissioned by the Musical Arts Society of La Jolla and was first performed by the Orchestra of the Musical Arts Society of La Jolla on August 13th, 1950. The piece has three movements: Poco allegro, Largo ‚Äì andante moderato, and Allegro.  Ballet 422  Ballet 422, a film directed by Jody Lee Lipes, follows Peck during the two months in which he choreographed and produced Paz de la Jolla. The film focuses on Peck's creative process and the work he put in leading up to the premiere, including shots of him during the first stages of choreographing the piece, teaching the ballet to the cast, working with costume designers Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung and the costume department of the New York City Ballet, staging it with the lighting director, Mark Stanley, talking to the orchestra, and on the night of the premiere. The film was nominated for the Documentary Award at the Seattle International Film Festival, the Jury Award at the Tribeca Film Festival, and the Golden Eye at the Zurich Film Festival.

Life and career  Suma was born in Balba, Albania, in the Diocese of Sap√´ to a noble Catholic family. On the same day he was baptized as \\"Zupin\\" by Don Nikola Kabashi. Suma was described as kind and diligent. Don Tibeo Paccalorzi, the principal of the Fermo College in Rome, wrote on April 15, 1711, that ‚ÄùMihael Summa is a person of which much is expected.\\" When Suma returned home from his studies, he was ordained a priest on 28 October 1718, in the parish church of Saxony by Marin Gjini. On 29 October Peter Karagiƒá appointed Suma as his Vicar General. Suma became the Capital Vicar of the Archdiocese in 1727 after Peter Karagiƒá died on 15 January. Archbishop Vicko Zmajeviƒá wrote on May 16, 1727 to the Rome Congregation recommending Suma as the Archbishop of Skopje. In 1727, after an investigation, the Pope selected Suma as the new Archbishop, and he was appointed on 15 November 1728. He was ordained a bishop on 3 July 1729 in Crkva sv. Spasitelja, Velja. In 1728, during the Great Turkish War, Suma began negotiations with the Austrian forces but was exposed by the Ottomans. He was forced to flee to Austria at the end of 1736. In the same year, he visited Osijek, Croatia. In 1737, Suma led the Albanian highlanders in an anti-Ottoman revolt, but after the Austrian forces retreat through Novi Pazar, the Albanians were left to resist for three years. During the spread of the plague in the region, it is believed that Suma stayed in Belgrade, but letters to Rome written on 6 April and 6 June 1739 show that he traveled to the Pe≈°ter region in the Novi Pazar. In his letters he describing how his countrymen in Pe≈°ter and Novi Pazar were subjected to Austrian rule. Suma was fluent in Albanian, Croatian and Turkish resulting in him being appreciated by the local Turks and Orthodox believers in Skopje (Shkup). After the Turks seized Belgrade, Suma fled to Osijek, where he had the status of an Imperial senior citizen, with 1800 forints a year as pension. He lived with his son, sat on the city council and became a merchant. Before 23 September 1743, Suma resigned as Archbiship, becoming Archbishop Emeritus. In 1765, Suma bought a house, where he lived with his son. He preached in Dakovo, Pedukh, Petrijevci, Valpov, Dardi, Vukovar, Ilok and Petrovaradin for many decades. In May 1777, Suma fell ill and on 20 November, at the age of 82, he died in his home surrounded by relatives. Suma was buried at the Franciscan church in Osijek by Bishop Krtica. In July 1778, a monument of black marble was raised above his tomb. Suma had been a priest for 59 years and a bishop for 48.

The co-founder of startups Avantome and Guardant Health, Eltoukhy was named to Time Magazine‚Äôs inaugural 50 Most Influential People in Healthcare (2018) and Fortune‚Äôs 40 under 40 (2017). Acquired by Illumina in 2008, Avantome was founded to develop and commercialize semiconductor-based DNA sequencing, during the race for the $1,000 genome. Guardant Health was founded to pioneer non-invasive liquid biopsy approaches for cancer diagnosis, monitoring, personalized medicine treatment, and research. Education Eltoukhy attended Bellarmine College Preparatory, studying college level math during his freshman year, and graduating in 1997. Subsequently, Eltoukhy studied electrical engineering at Stanford University, completing an accelerated Bachelor of Science (BS) in two and a half years, followed by Master of Science (MS) and Doctorate (PhD) degrees. Eltoukhy‚Äôs doctoral thesis, ‚ÄúAn integrated system for de novo DNA sequencing‚Äù research was completed in the laboratory of Abbas El Gamal, for a project that combined genomics and sensor engineering. Eltoukhy discovered that low cost CMOS image sensors coupled to light-emitting DNA sequencing reactions could form the basis for building a less expensive, portable DNA sequencer. Career =Genome Technology Center= After graduation, Eltoukhy completed a post- doctoral fellowship at Stanford University‚Äôs Genome Technology Center, investigating low-cost DNA sequencing technologies as part of the Human Genome Project. Eltoukhy‚Äôs research focused on developing new assays and detection methods, with an emphasis on semiconductor-based approaches for DNA sequencing. That research was funded, in part, by one of the first National Human Genome Research Institute grants awarded for massive parallel sequencing (also known as Next Generation Sequencing or NGS). =Avantome and Illumina= In 2007, Eltoukhy and Mostafa Ronaghi co-founded the biotechnology startup company Avantome, to accelerate the commercialization of semiconductor sequencing technologies and affordable high-throughput DNA sequencing. Eltoukhy was President and CEO of the new company until 2008, when Avantome was acquired by Illumina. As part of the acquisition terms, Ronaghi and Eltoukhy joined Illumina, where Eltoukhy continued pioneering genomic research as Director of Advanced Sequencing Development until 2012. At Illumina, Avantome‚Äôs CMOS/semiconductor sequencing platform became the basis for Project Firefly, a program to develop an \\"integrated sequencing solution simple and affordable enough to install in hospitals for routine testing\\". In 2018, Illumina launched iSEQ, a new product developed using Avantome‚Äôs CMOS sensor approach combined with nanowell technology; iSEQ delivered on the original Avantome goals of low cost instrumentation and reduced per-sample processing cost in a long read format. =Guardant Health= In 2012, Eltoukhy and AmirAli Talasaz co-founded Guardant Health, established to \\"forge a new frontier\\" in cancer detection and treatment using artificial intelligence and a big data approach. They developed new methods to detect and monitor the low levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments released into the bloodstream of people who have cancer, enabling cancer detection and monitoring using minimally-invasive blood tests (liquid biopsies) which are lower cost and lower risk compared to traditional tissue biopsies. Under Eltoukhy‚Äôs direction as CEO, Guardant Health raised over one billion dollars (US) in financing, launched three products, established collaborations with oncology researchers, and gained recognition as a healthcare innovator in liquid biopsy approaches used for cancer diagnosis and research. Named as a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer and to Fierce Biotech's Fierce 15 list in 2015, the company launched Guardant360, the first commercially available comprehensive liquid biopsy for cancer in 2014. The test uses a combination of genomics and signal processing innovations to simultaneously profile the mutational signature of several circulating tumor DNA genes in patient blood samples. By 2016, the test was in use by oncologists to guide personalized treatment plans for late-stage cancer patients, and to pair advanced cancer patients with clinical trial opportunities. The Food and Drug Administration granted Guardant360 Expedited Access Pathway status in 2018. GuardantOMNI, an expanded testing panel measuring levels of 500 circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) genes, was launched in 2017. Released for research use in 2019, LUNAR is an assay for high sensitivity detection of changes in genomic and epigenetic signatures of ctDNA in early stage and recurring cancers. In 2017, a venture capital funding round led by SoftBank raised $360 million, allowing Guardant Health to expand operations globally and continue to focus on accelerating progress towards early cancer detection. Eltoukhy and Talasaz rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq when Guardant Health went public (IPO) on October 4, 2018. In January 2019, Guardant Health entered a partnership with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to develop companion diagnostics. In October 2019, the company initiated ECLIPSE, a 10,000 patient colorectal cancer study, in an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of using blood tests to screen for colorectal cancer in the general population.

The building was built in 1887 to serve as a meeting hall for the various social organizations in Lincoln Park; while its first floor was dedicated to retail space, it had six meeting rooms on its upper floors. Chapters of national fraternal organizations and ethnic clubs formed by immigrants in the neighborhood met in the building, and its largest hall hosted speeches and performances as well. Designed by Frederick Alschlager, the building combines Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival elements. While its terra cotta clad storefronts and metal cornice are typical of the former style, its use of decorative brickwork and stone is inspired by the latter. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, 1984.

He was born in Carlow town to a prosperous Catholic shopkeeper, and educated at Knockbeg College and Blackrock College. He spent time in Mountjoy Prison during the Irish War of Independence and left Trinity College Dublin without graduating. His brother, Sean O'Farrell, was the commanding officer of the Carlow Brigade of the Irish Republican Army from the brigade's formation until September 1920. After his time in university, he worked for several years in the Belgian Congo as a Marine Superintendent of Customs, returning to Ireland after managing to sell a ship for a handsome profit. He worked for Radio √âireann and as a journalist. In 1930 he married businesswoman Frances Cautley Baker, divorced daughter of painter Frances Baker, with whom she ran a textile company in Blackrock, Dublin called the Crock of Gold. The Crock manufactured wool products, with Frances designing patterns and primarily selling wholesale to fashion houses. The couple settled in Kilmacanogue. In 1934 Farrell wrote, produced, and directed the silent film Some Say Chance, notable as the screen debut of Maureen O'Hara; Frances did set design and location scouting. Farrell's magnum opus, Thy Tears Might Cease, is a novel set in the Irish revolutionary period. Although the first draft was completed in 1937, it was published only posthumously in 1963, after editing by Monk Gibbon. He contributed as \\"Gulliver\\" to The Bell.

He participated in various battles and campaigns throughout the Pacific War and was eventually shot down and killed over Leyte, Philippines on 24 November 1944. He was officially credited with destroying nine enemy aircraft. Early career Ayao Shirane enrolled in the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in April 1933, and graduated as part of the 64th class in March 1937. He completed an aerial training program and became a fighter pilot in March 1939. He was assigned to the 12th Air Group in Central China in September of that year, and on 19 August 1940 participated in the Bombing of Chongqing. This mission marked the combat debut of the new Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter, although no aerial opposition was encountered. On 13 September, Shirane led six of Lieutenant Sabur≈ç Shindo's 13 Zeros on a bomber escort mission to Hankow. This mission marked the Zero's true baptism of fire, with the Japanese pilots claiming 27 out of 30 Chinese fighters (including one for Shirane) without suffering any losses in return. He was promoted to full Lieutenant in May 1941. Pacific War At the start of Pacific War, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to the carrier Akagi and participated in several early battles, including the Attack on Darwin and the Indian Ocean Raid. He was eventually appointed flight division leader (buntaich≈ç) of Akagi's fighter squadron. On 4 June 1942, he participated in the Battle of Midway, leading nine Akagi Zeros as part of the morning strike against Midway Island. His unit engaged the defending fighters of VMF-221 (claiming 11 destroyed), and then strafed the island, losing one plane in return.Akagi fighter squadron report at https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/rep/Midway/Nagumo/#III-5 He returned safely to Akagi, and was sent back into the air at 09.32 to intercept Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from USS Hornet's VT-8. His division missed the main engagement, but shot down the last plane, flown by Ensign George Gay, just after it cleared S≈çry≈´.Parshall and Tully, Shattered Sword, p.207 He went on to intercept the successive attacks of USS Enterprises VT-6 and USS Yorktowns VT-3 and VF-3. However, during the latter engagement Akagi was attacked and mortally damaged by Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers from Enterprise. With his carrier sinking, Shirane landed aboard Hiry≈´, the sole undamaged carrier. He was launched as part of her Combat Air Patrol (CAP) at 15.34, but was unable to prevent her own sinking at the hands of Enterprise and Yorktown dive bombers. He ditched his Zero at 19.00 and was rescued by the cruiser Nagara.Parshall and Tully, Shattered Sword, pp. 323-326, 501 In July 1942, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to the carrier Zuikaku and became its fighter squadron leader. On 24 August 1942, he participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. He led nine A6M Zeros that escorted the second strike on the US carriers, consisting of 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers under the command of Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi (Zuikaku dive bomber squadron leader and hik≈çtaich≈ç). However, they could not locate the enemy carriers since Takahashi failed to receive an updated report on the position of the US fleet. Nevertheless, the carrier Enterprise was badly damaged by Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki's first strike, which included Shirane's academy classmate, Lieutenant Keiichi Arima, as a division leader. On 26 October 1942, Lieutenant Shirane participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. As the senior fighter leader in Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata's first strike on the US carriers, he led 21 A6M Zeros (including eight from Zuikaku) as an escort for 21 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 20 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. However, on the way to the US fleet, nine Zuih≈ç Zeros led by Lieutenant Saneyasu Hidaka broke off to attack an incoming US strike force on a reciprocal course, reducing the escort to twelve Zeros. Shirane's own Zuikaku fighters were involved in intense aerial combat over the US fleet, where they shot down several Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and lost two of their own Zeros in return. After US dive bombers damaged Sh≈çkaku and Zuih≈ç, the remaining Japanese carriers, Zuikaku and Jun'y≈ç, launched follow-up strikes against the US carriers. Shirane again led Zeros to escort the bombers. On 1 November 1943, Shirane was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and was transferred to the 341st Air Group, which operated the new Kawanishi N1K fighters. On 24 November 1944, he was shot down and killed over Leyte, Philippines while he was engaged in combat with Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters.

She holds the position of Professor of Linguistics at the University of York. Vihman is widely cited as an expert on language development. Her views on infant babbling and the transition to intelligible, meaningful language have reached the mainstream media attention, including The New York Times, and The Guardian. According to Vihman, infant babbling paves the way to language as \\"kind of a predictor for being able to get word forms under control, so that you can make words that people will recognize.‚Äù  Education Vihman received her B.A. degree in Russian at Bryn Mawr College in 1961. She attended graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley where she obtained her Ph.D in Linguistics in 1971 under the supervision of Karl Zimmer. Her dissertation titled Livonian Phonology, with an Appendix on Stod in Danish and Livonian, focused on Livonian, a critically endangered Finno-Ugric language that is closely related to Estonian. Vihman received post-doctoral training at the Stanford Child Phonology Project, where she worked under the direction of Charles A. Ferguson. Vihman's research with Ferguson emphasized individual differences and variability in infant babbling and first words, up to the point of having a 50-word vocabulary. Career From 1980 to 1989, Vihman was Director of the Child Phonology Program at Stanford University. While at Stanford, Vihman conducted longitudinal research on six French-speaking infants in the late single-word period (approximate ages 10‚Äì18 months), with the dataset made publicly available through PhonBank and CHILDES. Vihman was also involved in creating the reference manual and user's guide for the Stanford Phonology Archive. Vihman was Associate Professor of Special Education at Southeastern Louisiana University from 1993 to 1995 and Professor of Developmental Psychology at Bangor University from 1996 to 2006. She moved to her current position at the University of York in 2007. Her research on various topics in language acquisition, such as the effects of input on early word learning, late talking toddlers, phonological acquisition in multilingual settings, and production templates in phonological and lexical development, has been funded through grants from the Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom.  Books  Vihman is the author of Phonological Development: The Origins of Language in the Child and the later edition Phonological Development: The First Two Years, which offer a functionalist perspective on child phonology and the emergence of referential language. In her most recent book Phonological Templates in Development, Vihman adopts a dynamic systems perspective, emphasizing the role of templates, or preferred word forms, in early lexical development. Vihman proposes infants are initially attracted to words with sounds they can say. If a word corresponds to a syllable that the infant already has in their repertoire, they will start making that syllable when the situation recurs and thus produce their first recognizable words. Vihman co-edited the volume The Emergence of Phonology: Whole-word Approaches and Cross-linguistic Evidence with her former student Tamar Keren-Portnoy. Personal Vihman met her husband, linguist Eero Vihman, in 1962. Eero taught her Estonian, and together they raised their children Virve-Anneli and Raivo Vihman in California while communicating almost exclusively in Estonian at home. Raivo's bilingual development has been featured in academic articles, and cited as an example of language mixing in infant bilingualism. Virve-Anneli Vihman is a member of the faculty of the Institute of Estonian and General Linguistics at the University of Tartu; she collaborated with her mother on a case study of early phonological development.

He was a member of the religious organization known as the \\"Sweet Singers\\" (or Covenanters), which defied Anglican orthodoxy and the restored Stuart monarchy. Jamison was arrested for burning a bible, then tried and sentenced to be hanged, however, on August 7, 1685, the King's Privy Council ordered the sentence commuted to exile. Jamison was required to serve an indenture of four years in America to cover the cost of his transportation. He was bound to George Lockhart who assigned him to Rev. Clarke, the chaplain of Fort James, which was under the control of Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick, the royal governor of New York. Due to Jamison's education, the citizens arranged to purchase his time and set him up to teach a Latin school in the city. Career Great Nine Partners Patent.

She has also previously served as president of the Society for Text and Discourse, and serves on the editorial board of Discourse Processes, a multidisciplinary journal published by Taylor & Francis.  Biography  McNamara received her B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Kansas in 1982, and her M.A. in Clinical Psychology from Wichita State University, Kansas, in 1989. In 1992, she earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. During her Ph.D., McNamara conducted research on learning theories with Alice F. Healy and reading comprehension with Walter Kintsch. She moved into educational research after receiving two grants from the James S. McDonnell Foundation to apply cognitive psychology principles to education. McNamara is the Director of the Science of Learning and Educational Technology (SoLET) Lab, where she and her team research and develop intelligent tutoring systems and natural language processing software. SoLET learning technologies like iSTART, a game-based tool to help readers develop self-explanation strategies, and Writing Pal, an intelligent writing tutor with game-based writing guides and automatic feedback, are free to access online through McNamara's Adaptive Literacy website. iSTART and Writing Pal are funded by the U.S. Department of Education through the Institute of Education Sciences.  Research  McNamara's research focuses on the development of intelligent tutoring systems that use game-based exercises to increase learner motivation when practicing reading and writing strategies. She developed the intelligent tutoring system Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking (iSTART), an online application based on the idea of Self-Explanation Reading Training (SERT), which coaches learners to use active reading strategies. iSTART has been found to be as effective as live, one-on-one human tutoring of SERT in improving students' quality of self-explanation when reading. With Arthur Graesser, McNamara developed Coh-Metrix, a computational tool for evaluating text readability based on measuring levels of cohesion, world knowledge, language and discourse characteristics. Coh-Metrix has made it easier for researchers and publishers to assess text difficulty and cohesion without relying on previous methods that focused primarily on word and sentence length.

Pomegranate seeds and parsley garnish the hummus. The author cites Exodus 38:33-34, which begins, \\"On its hem you shall make pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet yarns...\\" (English Standard Version) Helen Corey (born October 9, 1923) is a Syrian-American cookbook author, television producer, and educator. She is also the first Syrian-American woman to have held elected office in Indiana. She is known for her cookbooks The Art of Syrian Cookery (1962) and Helen Corey's Food from Biblical Lands (1989), in which she stressed the biblical origins of Middle Eastern cuisine and the value of sharing food as a vehicle for cross-cultural and inter-faith dialogue. In her cookbooks she also promoted awareness of Eastern Christianity in the United States, by discussing her family's culture in the Antiochian Orthodox Church.  Family and early life  Helen Corey‚Äôs parents, Maheeba (‚ÄúMabel‚Äù) and Mkhyal (‚ÄúMichael‚Äù), were born in the Arne and Ein el-shara suburbs of Damascus, Syria, and migrated to the United States. Helen Corey was born on October 9, 1923 in Canton, Ohio, and lived there until she moved to Terre Haute, Indiana in 1946. She and her family were part of a wave of Arabic immigrants who migrated to Terre Haute during the early twentieth century and who settled there due to the city‚Äôs ‚Äúpotential for prosperity through farming, mining and a growing manufacturing base.‚Äù As early as 1927, the town had a sufficiently substantial Syrian Christian community that its members wrote and notarized a constitution for its church, St. George Orthodox Church. In 2018, Corey participated in a ceremony commemorating a historical marker for ‚ÄúLittle Syria on the Wabash‚Äù, the site of the original twentieth-century immigrant Syrian neighborhoods of Terre Haute. As a member of St. George Orthodox Church (the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox church of Terre Haute) Helen Corey often acted as a de facto ambassador for her church. She also served on this church‚Äôs board of trustees. Through her cookbooks, television show, and other public programs, she aimed to raise public awareness about Syrian culture and to share information on the Antiochian Orthodox Church‚Äôs feast and fast days. With five godchildren, Corey describes herself as belonging to a close-knit family community.  Career and civic engagement  Helen Corey published The Art of Syrian Cookery in 1962. Years later, she founded a press, called CharLyn Publishing, which then published her second major cookbook, Helen Corey‚Äôs Food From Biblical Lands in 1989, followed by Healthy Syrian and Lebanese Cooking in 2004. Corey produced a televised show inspired by Food From Biblical Lands in 1990 and a later documentary about Easter as observed in the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox Church Easter. She occasionally hosted television shows and often interviewed international guests. Her 2004 book Healthy Syrian and Lebanese Cooking received first place in the National Federation of Press Women, out of 1,700 books submitted. Helen Corey‚Äôs Food From Biblical Lands was out of print until October 2016, when Echo Print Books and Media issued an updated version of the cookbook for the Middle Eastern Festival sponsored in Terre Haute, Indiana by St. George Social Center. Proceeds from the book sale benefited the associated St. George Orthodox Church. Helen Corey worked for many years in municipal and state government. From 1948 to 1961 she was secretary to the mayor of Terre Haute and Indiana‚Äôs Young Democrat National Committeewoman. In November 1964, she was elected Reporter for the Supreme and Appellate Courts ‚Äì and thereby the first Syrian American elected to public office in Indiana. At one time she also served on the Indiana Governor‚Äôs Commission on the Status of Women. Through her cookbooks, television show, and other public programs, she aimed to raise public awareness about Syrian culture and to share information on the Antiochian Orthodox Church‚Äôs feast and fast days.  Cooking  = Religion = In her cookbooks, Corey prominently features dishes associated with Lent, when Christians in the Antiochan Orthodox Church and in many other Middle Eastern churches abstain from meat, poultry, dairy, and eggs during the forty days before Easter and in preparation for the Passion of Christ. Lenten dishes are either vegan or based on fish. Orthodox Christians follow the same guidelines on Wednesdays and Fridays, as well as smaller fasts throughout the year. Before Lent, Christians in different countries have had different traditions regarding pre-Lent meals. Corey‚Äôs cookbooks include many recipes centered around pre-Lent dishes in Syria, especially kibby (beef or lamb- stuffed wheat), the national dish of Syria and Lebanon. Syrian Orthodox Christians, she reported, also partake in a ‚Äúcheese-fare‚Äù the week before Lent in which they sampled many cheeses before the fast begins. The pre-fast rituals ended with the consumption of a boiled egg. Lent also ended with the breaking of an egg, common in many Christian traditions. Corey‚Äôs cookbooks also include many Lenten recipes, including hummus bi-tahini (chickpeas pureed with sesame paste). Many of Corey‚Äôs Lenten foods consist of ingredients commonly used in many Syrian dishes, such as lentils, fava beans, and eggplant. = Culinary diplomacy = Corey's cookbooks have been described as participating in culinary diplomacy, the practice of promoting cultural links between people in different countries or communities through sharing foods and drinks - respective culinary repertoires ‚Äì whether through published recipes, via film, or in restaurants or home kitchens, in ways that facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding. Historian Jennifer Dueck has noted that cookbooks like Corey's were appreciated by the American mainstream as evidenced by their multiple editions and major publishers.

That synthesis reflected both the position of Strasbourg as a crossroads of European cultures, and the search for a specific identity of the locals, who had been incorporated into the German Empire some 30 years prior, after two centuries of French domination.  Architecture  23, rue Oberlin (1904), by L√ºtke & Backes Art Nouveau houses (multi-story buildings and villas), department stores, and other public buildings such as a concert hall, and a church, were built in the years 1898‚Äì1910 in the Neustadt district, the Neudorf district, the historic city center, and in the Krutenau district. Most of these have survived World War II and the changes of taste, and many are classified as Monuments historiques. The most notable architects were the associates Franz L√ºtke (1860‚Äì1929) and Heinrich Backes (1866‚Äì1931); Jules (Julius) Berninger (1856‚Äì1926) and Gustave (Gustav) Krafft (1861‚Äì1927); Joseph M√ºller (1863‚Äì??) and ; David Falk (1875‚Äì1949) and √âmile Wolf (1874‚Äì??); Auguste Mossler (1873‚Äì1947) and Auguste M√ºller (1863‚Äì1936), as well as the unaffiliated Fritz Beblo, Auguste Brion (1861‚Äì1940), Samuel Landshut (1860‚Äì1919), , and Aloys Walter (1869‚Äì1926).

These artists, as well several others who were not drawn to Art Nouveau/Jugendstil (Alfred Marzolff, L√©o Schnug, Lothar von Seebach, Gustave Stoskopf...), were members of the Cercle de Saint-L√©onard, a francophile circle of painters, playwrights, sculptors, and designers, established in 1897 and strongly attached to redefining and reinventing Alsatian regionalist art. Fran√ßois-Rupert Carabin, born in Saverne and buried in Strasbourg, did not spend the Art Nouveau years in Alsace-Lorraine; nevertheless, due to his having become the director of the √âcole des arts d√©coratifs de Strasbourg after World War I, the Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art owns a large and representative collection of his works in all domains.

Background The result at the last general election and the current situation in the House of Commons is given below: Electoral system Provisionally, the next general election will be conducted using the same electoral system as the 2019 election (first-past-the-post). The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the fifteen-year limit on voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a voter identification requirement in Great Britain. =Boundary review= In March 2020, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith confirmed that the 2021 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies would commence based on retaining 650 seats. The 2021 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies will begin in 2021 with the existing relevant legislation amended by the Parliamentary Constituencies Bill 2019-21. The postponed Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies proposed reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600. In April 2016, each of the four parliamentary Boundary Commissions of the United Kingdom recommenced their review process. A projection by psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of how the 2017 votes would have translated to seats under the new boundaries suggested the changes would be beneficial to the Conservative Party and detrimental to Labour. Boundary changes cannot be implemented until they are approved by both Houses of Parliament. No changes were submitted by the government during the 2017‚Äì2019 Parliament. The majority Conservative government manifesto states that this will be implemented before the next general election. Date of the election The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (FTPA) introduced fixed-term parliaments to the United Kingdom, with elections scheduled on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, unless the previous general election took place between 1 January and the first Thursday in May, in which case the election takes place on the first Thursday in May of the fourth year after the previous general election. Removing the power of the monarch, on advice of the prime minister, to dissolve parliament before its five-year maximum length, the act permits early dissolution if the House of Commons votes by a two-thirds supermajority. Parliament is also dissolved if a government loses a vote of no confidence by a simple majority and a new government is not formed within 14 days. Alternatively, a bill requiring just a simple majority in both Houses could be introduced to establish in law an earlier date for the election, which is how the date of the previous general election was set in 2019. Thus, the next general election is due to take place on Thursday 2 May 2024, unless it is triggered earlier. Under the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 parliament would be dissolved 25 working days before this date on Monday 26 March 2024. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the Prime Minister may schedule polling day up to two months after 2 May 2024, subject to approval by both Houses. =Proposed repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act= At the 2019 general election, where the Conservatives won a majority of 80 seats, the manifesto of the party contained a commitment to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act due to \\"paralysis at a time when the country has needed decisive action\\". The pledge was confirmed in the first Queen's Speech following the election. However, as the FTPA repealed the previous legislation in relation to limited term parliaments, further legislation would be required to set out how long parliaments should last.

It grows on trees and is native to eastern North America. Description Usnea trichodea hangs from the branches and twigs of trees and can reach a length of . The main branches are smooth and slender, with a diameter of less than ; they send out side branches at an obtuse angle at intervals. The thallus is divided into articulating sections with raised cracks between; the medulla is dense and white while the axis is reddish-brown. It could be confused with Usnea longissima but the branching structure and reddish axis are distinctive. Distribution and habitat Usnea trichodea occurs in eastern North America where it grows on trees. Its range extends from Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and eastern Quebec in Canada, southwards to Texas and Florida in the United States. Ecology Some lichens are extremely sensitive to pollution, and it has been found that Usnea trichodea and Evernia spp. will sicken and die if exposed to sulphur dioxide. These lichens can be used as indicators of air pollution. Researchers found that in Nova Scotia, the tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), which roosts in tree foliage over much of its range, was roosting exclusively in the dangling thalli of Usnea trichodea; the lichen was typically growing on conifers, the majority of which were species of spruce. The authors of the study speculated that the tricolored bats might use the lichen, which contains usnic acid, to reduce parasitism, as the bats were found to be free of ectoparasites.

The county formed part of the Nation's Moshulatubbee District, or First District, one of three administrative super-regions.  History  The county was also called Nvnih Chufvk Kaunti. The Choctaw word nvnih means ‚Äúa mountain or high hill‚Äù and chufvk means ‚Äúa pointed object.‚Äù (The apparent lower-case letter ‚Äúv‚Äù is the Greek letter upsilon, which makes a short ‚Äúu‚Äù sound, for a pronunciation akin to ‚Äúnunih chufuk.‚Äù) This description referred to Sugar Loaf Mountain, which anchored the county's eastern border with Arkansas southeast of Poteau, east of the community of Gilmore. Sugar Loaf Mountain, whose summit is very conical, is locally prominent, rising from the valley floor to an elevation of 2,560 feet.‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 319-320. Sugar Loaf County was one of the original 19 counties created by the General Council of the Choctaw Nation in 1850.‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 319-320. The county's boundaries were established and designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as were the boundaries of all Choctaw Nation counties. The county was bordered on the south by the Winding Stair Mountains. The county's northern border threaded its way through well-defined valleys along Cavanal Mountain and adjacent ridges, following Cedar Creek, Fourche Maline, and the Poteau River. Its eastern border was with Arkansas, and its western border was formed by a line from the source of Gaines Creek north to the headwaters of Bayouzeal. It then followed the Bayouzeal to the Skullyville County boundary line. (Bayouzeal is not a stream name currently in use, and the exact identity of the stream in question is unknown. Maps from the 1800s suggest it may be Brushy Creek or Brazil Creek.)Map of the Indian and Oklahoma Territories. Rand McNally and Company, 1892; John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, Plate 38. The county courthouse at statehood was located at Conser, a settlement which is no longer extant. It was located southwest of present-day Heavener, west of Hodgen, and southeast of Wister Lake. The county served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge's duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 15; ‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 323, 332.  Statehood  As Oklahoma's statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state's counties that, while logically designed, the Choctaw Nation's counties could not exist as economically viable political subdivisions. In most the county seat existed generally for holding county court and not as a population center. This was certainly true of sparsely populated Sugar Loaf County. This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also proposed a county structure that abolished the Choctaw counties. Sugar Loaf County was divided principally into the proposed Wade County and Rutherford County. Poteau would have been Rutherford County's principal town. Talihina and Heavener would have been the largest towns in Wade County.Map, ‚ÄúState of Sequoyah,‚Äù compiled by the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, 1905. Amos Maxwell, Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Meador Publishing Col., 1953. Although the map carried in wikipedia's article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell's book offers further insight. Almost none of this proposition was borrowed two years later by Oklahoma's framers, who adopted a very different county structure for the region. The territory formerly comprising Sugar Loaf County, Choctaw Nation now falls within Le Flore County, Oklahoma. Sugar Loaf County ceased to exist upon Oklahoma's statehood on November 16, 1907.

I., Introduction to the Pentateuch in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J. (2001), The Oxford Bible Commentary, p. 19 The opening sentence of this chapter (and this book) is identical to the final sentence of 2 Chronicles. Text Right column of p. 575 of the Greek Uncial manuscript Codex Vaticanus (4th century AD), from the Vatican Library, containing 1 Esdras 1:55-2:5. The original text is written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 11 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). An ancient Greek book called 1 Esdras (Greek: ·ºúœÉŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ Œë π) containing some parts of 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah is included in most editions of the Septuagint and is placed before the single book of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah (which is titled in Greek: ·ºúœÉŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ Œí π). 1 Esdras 2:1-14 is an equivalent of Ezra 1:1-11 (Cyrus's edict).Catholic Encyclopedia: Esdras: THE BOOKS OF ESDRAS: III EsdrasJewish Encyclopedia: Esdras, Books of: I Esdras God is sovereign (1:1‚Äì4) The Nabonidus Chronicle, which contains the title of Cyrus as the \\"king of Persia\\". Front of the Cyrus Cylinder, containing inscription similar to the Cyrus's edict. The book starts with a historical context of a real event: ‚Äúthe first year of Cyrus king of Persia‚Äù, but immediately follows with the statement about God who has the real control and even already speaks about this event before the birth of Cyrus (Isaiah 44:28; 45:13) and the fulfillment of his word through Jeremiah. =Verse 1= :Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, KJV *Cross reference: 2 Chronicles 36:22 *\\"Now\\": translated from the Hebrew connecting word \\"waw\\".

He \\"put in writing\\" a declaration in Akkadian cuneiform script on a clay cylinder, now known as the \\"Cyrus Cylinder\\", which was used as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, when the Neo-Babylonian Empire was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his Persian Empire. The words recorded in verses 2‚Äì4 are thought to represent the oral form of the edict, whereas the written form is recorded in chapter 6. =Verse 2= :Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: :\\"The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has charged me to build Him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.\\" MEV *Cross reference: 2 Chronicles 36:23 In the Cyrus Cylinder there is a statement related to the Cyrus's edict which gives the historical background to the book of Ezra: :I returned the images of the gods, who had resided there [i.e., in Babylon], to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes. I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings.Line 32 in Text adapted from . English translation adapted from Cogan's translation in . Cyrus's edict is significant to the return of the Jews, because it shows that they did not slip away from Babylon but were given official permission by the Persian king in the first year of his rule, and it is a specific fulfillment of the seventy years prophecy of Jeremiah (; ). =Verse 3= :Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.

Cooperation (1:5‚Äì11) In response to Cyrus's Decree, the family heads of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the priests and the Levites rose up and went to Jerusalem, but the ten other tribes did not show any reactions. The last three verses detail the inventory of captured temple articles (probably based on the official document authorizing the return) which are counted out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah, to be brought from Babylon to Jerusalem. =Verse 7= :Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; KJV The Temple treasures that Nebuchadnezzar took away () are now to be returned to Jerusalem.

Park-and-ride railway stations in the United Kingdom Several mainly park-and-ride-status railway stations in England have the suffix \\"parkway\\" in their name. The etymology is from the original U.S. meaning as the Bristol Parkway railway station was named after the adjacent M32 motorway, originally known as The Parkway because of its green-buffered route into the city. Bristol Parkway was the first railway station so named, in 1972. The majority of such stations were opened in the late 20th century to relieve pressure on existing city centre stations. Examples such as Didcot Parkway are renamings following the expansion of the car parking facilities where the name is used promotionally (for example commuters to Oxford are encouraged to leave their car at Didcot and travel to Oxford by train) whereas in others with multi-storey car parks serving modest settlements such as Brookwood and Fleet the suffix has not been adopted. Luton Airport Parkway and Southampton Airport Parkway are examples serving Luton and Southampton airports. Some were so named as they are not in easy walking distance of an airport terminal; passengers use shuttle bus services, although Southampton Airport station is within easy walking distance of Southampton Airport and has no separate car parking facilities of its own. In the United States In the United States, it is common for outlying rail stations to include automobile parking, often with hundreds of spaces. Boston, for example, has built several large parking facilities at its commuter rail and metro stations near major highways and large arterial surface roads around the periphery of the city: Alewife, Braintree, Forest Hills, Hyde Park, Quincy Adams, Riverside, Route 128, Wellington, Woburn. The local transit operator, the MBTA, offers 46,000 park and ride spaces.

Monroe was a lawyer, pioneer, and suffragette who spent the majority of her days in Topeka, Kansas. She contributed significantly to the Women's suffrage movement in Kansas. She also compiled the stories of over 800 women pioneers, which her great-granddaughter published as a book in 1982. Life Lilla Day Monroe was born Lilla Day Moore on November 11, 1859, in Mooresburg, Indiana. Mooresburg is in Pulaski County, Indiana and was named for her father. Her mother raised her in the traditional homemaker skills. She taught her the importance of reading. Mother, daughter, and brothers walked regularly to a distant library to borrow books. The books were read and discussed after studies. Monroe's first occupation was that of a schoolteacher. The law Monroe started reading for the law early, initially for Judge Slack of Indiana. She migrated to Wakeeney, Kansas, in 1884, just at the end of the frontier era. There she met and married Lee Monroe, who was an attorney originally from Pennsylvania. They raised four children. Monroe was interested in the law, so she clerked in her husband's practice. She also studied law with her husband at home. She passed the local bar examination in 1894. Then she practiced law in the District Court. On May 7, 1895, she became the first woman admitted to practice in the Kansas Supreme Court. When her husband became judge of the Twenty-Third Judicial District, every court where Moore might practice was covered by her husband. Moore suspended all private practice of the law. She must have perceived a possible conflict or the appearance of one. Moore did, however, continue to use her training in volunteer pursuits for women's suffrage and other laws. Women's suffrage In what is assumed to be one of her earliest speeches regarding women's suffrage, titled, \\"Intemperance and Women's Rights\\", she argued for women to have the right to vote using liquor regulation laws as an example. The Monroe family moved to Topeka, Kansas, in 1901. There Monroe became active in many causes, but most notably suffrage. She joined the Kansas State Suffrage Association. She served as its president for many years. She was also the head of the Kansas branch of the National Woman's Party. From 1908 to 1912, Monroe spent significant time urging legislators to support Women's suffrage. She also made numerous public lectures espousing the need for expanded women's rights. The Monroe home was located where the Docking State Office Building now resides in Topeka, the state capital. Monroe's home hosted many women and organizations who were participants in Women's suffrage. Monroe's children pointed out that it was commonplace for some of the women to become houseguests for many weeks. Monroe composed and wrote a book during the years she worked towards accomplishing Women's suffrage. The book was entitled, \\"The Gee-Gee's Mother Goose\\" and was full of verse and nursery rhymes. She once explained that the book's goal was to alleviate tension \\"when the argument grew too heated\\". No matter how dedicated she was to Women's suffrage, Monroe was adamantly against being used for other purposes. When it seemed that the movement had been turned over to the Democrats, she resigned from her position as Kansas chair. She resigned from the organization as well. She claimed that the organization was putting the agenda of the Democratic party first and Women's suffrage second. Monroe wrote and spoke quite frequently. Published accounts demonstrate Monroe's works were popular for their content as well as their delivery. It is also demonstrated in her 1906 address \\"Some Women Suffrage History,\\" to a mixed audience at Pike's Pawnee Village in honor of their centennial celebrations. The Pawnee Village was an event established from the Good Government Club which involved Munroe and her friends one year prior. In 1919, Monroe was elected the first President of the Kansas Women Lawyers Association. Accordingly, the Association appropriated the same legislative programs as the Good Government Club. With Monroe piloting the association, it seemed normal when the association encouraged women to become lawyers. That would enable them to better further the interests of women and children.This plea for more women lawyers was cited in the women Lawyers' Journal. Monroe was also a member of the Kansas Equal Suffrage Association. This organization actively advocated for legislators to pass laws regarding women's rights. Monroe was the president of the organization for many years. Other ventures =Kansas Day Club= An event known as the Kansas Day Club had existed for a long time of which purpose had been to celebrate Kansas statehood. In 1905, Munroe and her friends felt that a women's version of the event would be more gratifying than being passive observers of the men's club. Monroe was an officer in the new Women's Kansas Day Club. She also composed the club's articles. The purpose of the club was to gather and preserve Kansas history and encourage patriotism among the youth of the state. The club was an outshoot of the Good Government Club. =Good Government Club= Monroe spent many years as a lobbyist with the Good Government Club of Topeka. This and her good reputation led a unanimous Senate to allow her free rein to the Senate floor. Monroe appears to have the most material in the Hand Book of Laws. Laws discussed in this handbook are mostly from reprints from her articles published in The Women Lawyers' Journal. Monroe spent 27 years as the head of this club's lobbying efforts. Other lobbying attempts included a minimum wage bill, child hygiene division in the State Board of Health, the property and inheritance laws, prenuptial contracts, divorce reform, \\"care and confinement degenerates, and the segregation of mental and moral delinquents\\", equal tax exemption to both sexes. Monroe experienced a great deal of success in lobbying for Wome's suffrage and other examples mentioned herein. =Other clubs= Monroe created and edited The Club Woman. She created and edited The Kansas Woman's Journal. She was a member of the Women's Press Association, the State Federation of Clubs, the Business and Professional Women's Club, and the National League of Pen Women. Pioneer women stories While Munroe was publishing her magazine, The Kansas Women's Journal, she started a journalism project to record the stories of pioneer women, which her daughter and great-granddaughter continued after she died. Munroe preserved more than 800 stories related by or about pioneer women. The stories reflect the adversity the women faced in settling the American frontier and their strength in overcoming these obstacles. The project is still in existence today, maintained as the Lilla Day Monroe Collection of Pioneer Women's Stories. Death and legacy Monroe's daughter Lenore Monroe Stratton carried the project on by typing and indexing the stories. Then, Monroe's great-granddaughter Joanna Stratton, who was a Harvard University professor, was the woman who finally published Monroe's pioneer women stories as a complete volume in Simon and Schuster's Pioneer Women, Voices From the Kansas Frontier in 1982.

Dec (January 6, 1926January 21, 1996) was an American lawyer and outsider writer who was best known for his typewritten diatribes that he independently mailed and published from the late 1960s onward. His works are characterized by highly accusatory and vulgar attacks on various subjects, often making use of phrases like \\"Mad Deadly Worldwide Communist Gangster Computer God\\" to slander hierarchies that he believed were engaging in electronic harassment against him. Biography Francis E. Dec was born in New York on January 6, 1926. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he enlisted into the United States Army with the rank of private. However, he remained within the United States for the duration of the war, albeit periodically moving between bases, at one point being assigned to Yuma Army Air Station. After the war, Dec entered into law, but was eventually disbarred by the state of New York in 1958 and proceeded to make numerous \\"incoherent\\" legal appeals, including an appeal to the Supreme Court. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 60 days in 1961 and in 1965 attempted to flee his home in Hempstead, New York for Poland. Dec spent the next 25 years writing and distributing lengthy screeds about the \\"Worldwide Communist Gangster Computer God\\" and its conspiracy to control the world through electronic mind control devices, or influencing machines. These flyers were mailed to radio and television stations across the United States. Analysis Jeffrey Sconce analyzed the written works of Francis E. Dec in his book The Technical Delusion: Electronics, Power, Insanity, within a chapter discussing the phenomenon of targeted individuals. In it, he states that \\"his writing speaks to a feature of technical delusions that became increasingly prominent in the second half of the twentieth century.\\" Sconce also identifies that \\"Dec's screeds are emblematic in their careening, amplified panic over imperious yet chimerical powers that seemingly are everywhere all the time and yet can never be fully confronted or understood.\\" Legacy Dec gained a cult following in the 1980s, especially when specific fans of his attempted to contact him. In 1989, Dec went on a sojourn to New York, and fans attempting to contact him at his house were left facing his house in dismay: > \\"The house is daubed red-on-blue, surrounded by wild hedges, and has a blue > trash can with ornamental glass knob for a mailbox. Heavy blinds kept us > from viewing any 'strange stuff' inside. It was I who asked the cabbies > about Dec: 'Dat old German mon? He's in dere!' 'Is he, you know...' pointing > to my head. 'Well, look at de house, mon!' End of adventure. Should've sent > money.\\" Among other figures interested in Dec's works were William S. Burroughs and Genesis P-Orridge; the latter used a recording of his voice on the Psychic TV album \\"Ultrahouse (The L.A. Connection)\\". A 1983 issue of Weirdo by Robert Crumb was based on Dec's works, and a stage play inspired by Dec, titled A History of Heen (not Francis E. Dec Esq.) premiered in 1999.

Bakaj (; b. 1982) is a Washington, DC attorney and former intelligence officer with the Central Intelligence Agency. He was the principal attorney representing the whistleblower who filed the initial complaint that led to the launch of multiple investigations by the United States Congress into the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal, the impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump, and, ultimately, the Impeachment of Donald Trump. Bakaj is the founding and managing partner of Compass Rose Legal Group. He represented multiple whistleblowers in the U.S. House of Representatives investigations into the Trump Administration. Previously while serving as a U.S. government official, he designed the legal and investigative apparatus to protect intelligence community whistleblowers.  Early Life and Education Bakaj was born in Stamford, Connecticut and is a graduate of Trinity Catholic High School. He subsequently went on to attend The George Washington University, Elliott School of International Affairs in Washington, DC from which he earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in International Affairs with a concentration in National Security Policy. Bakaj earned his Juris Doctorate from Syracuse University College of Law in Syracuse, New York, specializing in both national security law and public international law.  Career  As a student attending The George Washington University, Bakaj interned for three United States Senators: Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Charles Schumer, and Hillary Clinton. Bakaj's internship with Clinton coincided with the September 11 attacks, and he worked directly for her foreign policy advisor. Subsequently in 2002, Bakaj served the Department of State overseas with the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. During his tour and while traveling to L‚Äôviv, Ukraine on mission, a deadly air show accident occurred at the Sknyliv Airfield. Due to his proficiency in Ukrainian and proximity to the disaster, Bakaj coordinated with the Embassy in Kyiv to secure emergency aid from the United States. Bakaj continued his public service while in law school, clerking with the Department of Justice. Upon graduating law school, he became a government official with the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General and subsequently the Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General. While with the Department of Defense, Bakaj created the department‚Äôs legal and investigative framework for national security whistleblower reprisal investigations. As a consequence of this accomplishment, the Department of Defense recognized him with a Career Achievement Award. The program he developed became the model for what would eventually become Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD-19), Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information, issued by President Barack Obama in 2012. Bakaj eventually transitioned to the CIA where he created a whistleblower protection program modeled on the one he developed at the Defense Department so as to comply with the directive. In 2014, Bakaj was instrumental in protecting CIA officers within the Office of Inspector General who reported misconduct within their chain-of-command and, ultimately, to him. The disclosures included allegations that individuals within his own office (the CIA Office of Inspector General) fabricated evidence in a federal criminal investigation in order to obtain a false prosecution. In elevating the matter, he protected the whistleblowers who disclosed the information to him. Because he refused to compromise their identity, Bakaj himself was ultimately reprised against by then-Inspector General David B. Buckley, an Obama appointee. In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Christopher Sharpley to assume the role of CIA Inspector General. Shortly after Sharpley‚Äôs confirmation hearing, Bakaj presented evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence establishing that Sharpley was less than candid during his confirmation hearing. As a result of Bakaj‚Äôs disclosure, the White House subsequently withdrew Sharpley‚Äôs nomination. In 2018 Sharpley resigned from the CIA. In 2019, a years-long investigation found that Buckley illegally reprised against Bakaj. Upon transitioning from government service, Bakaj assumed the role as Special Of Counsel with Mark S. Zaid, P.C. and founded Compass Rose Legal Group, PLLC.  Impeachment Inquiry of President Donald J. Trump  Bakaj was lead counsel representing the whistleblower who filed the initial complaint that led to the launch of multiple investigations by the United States Congress into the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal, the impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump, and, ultimately, the Impeachment of Donald Trump. A friend of the whistleblower, who is an attorney and an expert on national security law, referred the whistleblower to Bakaj, who had more expertise on whistleblower procedure and law. Bakaj provided the whistleblower guidance on filing the complaint. On August 11, 2019, per Bakaj's guidance, the whistleblower filed the complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC). The whistleblower's complaint was deemed credible and a matter of \\"urgent concern\\" by the IGIC.Mary Clare Jalonick, Acting intelligence chief agrees to testify after subpoena, Associated Press (September 18, 2019). Under federal law, when the IGIC determines that an complaint credibly raises an urgent concern, he or she forwards it to the relevant agency head (here, the DNI), who is required to forward it to the congressional intelligence committees within seven days.Kel McClanahan, Q&A; on Whistleblower Complaint Being Withheld from Congressional Intelligence Committees, Just Security (September 17, 2019). In this case, however, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, withheld the complaint from Congress.Kyle Cheney, Schiff accuses top intel official of illegally withholding 'urgent' whistleblower complaint, Politico(September 13, 2019). On September 9, 2019, Bakaj hand-delivered a letter informing the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the complaint‚Äôs existence and that ‚ÄúThe ICIG has informed [Bakaj] that . . . . my client‚Äôs disclosure will not be transmitted to Congress because the Acting Director of National Intelligence views the matter as 'outside the scope' of the applicable whistleblower statute\\". The next day, the committee‚Äôs Democratic chairman, Adam Schiff, wrote Maguire demanding the release the complaint, and was rebuffed. Maguire later testified that the White House counsel had told him he could not release the whistle-blower‚Äôs complaint to Congress because it was covered by executive privilege. Schiff went public. Facing a subpoena, the DNI finally released the complaint to Congress on September 25, 2019. On September 24, 2019, because his client's complaint was being blocked from transmittal to Congress, Bakaj sent a letter to Maguire providing \\"formal notice\\" of his intent to contact congressional intelligence committees directly concerning the matter. The following day the White House authorized the complaint be transmitted to congress. On November 7, 2019, Bakaj sent a letter to the White House warning President Trump to \\"cease and desist\\" calling for the public disclosure of the whistleblower's identity and \\"engaging in rhetoric and activity that places the whistleblower and their family in physical danger.\\" He said the president would be legally and morally liable if anyone were to be \\"physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates', behavior.\\" It has been reported that Bakaj and his co-counsel, Mark Zaid, have received death threats that are being investigated by the FBI. In a New York Times OpEd on March 2, 2020, Bakaj advocated protecting, expanding, and enhancing federal whistleblower protection laws.Andrew P. Bakaj and Mark S. Zaid,We Represented the Whistle- Blower. The Law Needs Urgent Help, The New York Times (March 1, 2020, Online Edition); Those Who Tell Need Urgent Help, The New York Times, March 2, 2020, at Section A, Page 27 (Print Edition). In a Washington Post OpEd on April 14, 2020, Bakaj expressed concern about the purging of Inspectors General following Michael Atkinson's firing by President Trump, stating that \\"alarm bells should be going off\\". Bakaj and authors Zaid and John Tye discussed the impact of such actions. In light of the President questioning the independence and integrity of the Health and Human Services Inspector General and removing Glenn A.

Testosterone is a banned drug under the laws of the World Anti Doping Agency. He faced a tribunal in Manchester, United Kingdom in November and December 2019, but, due to his deteriorating health, the tribunal was postponed to April 2020. Career Richard Freeman worked as the head of medicine and head of sports science at Bolton Wanderers F.C. from 2001-09. He began working for British Cycling and Team Sky in 2009. Bradley Wiggins in 2011. He was granted the Therapeutic use exemption shortly before the 2011 Tour de France. The General Medical Council alleged that, in May 2011, Freeman ordered 30 Testogel (testosterone) sachets from Fit4Sports Limited to the National Cycling Centre, Manchester. It is also alleged that Freeman claimed that the delivery was a mistake and later asked for confirmation to be sent from Fit4Sports asking for the return of the delivery. On 12 June 2011, Freeman received a jiffy bag from British Cycling coach Simon Cope. An investigation into the jiffy bag, conducted by UK Anti- Doping, revealed that the bag had been moved by Cope in an airplane to Geneva, Switzerland where it was driven to La Toissure, France. The contents of the package is disputed. Later in June, Freeman arranged a Therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for Bradley Wiggins to take triamcinolone. Freeman denies any wrongdoing surrounding the powerful drug, stating that he was \\"abiding by the TUE system\\". Freeman has said that his laptop, where medical records of the cyclists were kept, was stolen from a Greek hotel in 2014. Thus, the contents of the jiffy bag is not certain. Freeman claims that it contained Fluimucil, but the medication is common throughout Europe; this questions the need to have the package sent by air. He resigned from British Cycling in October 2017, citing \\"stress related issues\\". Medical tribunal The tribunal began in early November 2019, with 22 allegations against Freeman surrounding the incidents in May 2011. He admitted to 18 of the allegations, including the claim \\"that he asked supplier Fit4Sport to falsely claim the Testogel has been sent in error\\". The employee who sent the false email claims that \\"she trusted Dr Freeman because he is a doctor\\" and also that the 30 Testogel sachets were never returned to the company. Although Freeman admitted to the allegations, he claimed that the testosterone was intended for former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton, which Sutton strongly denied. Freeman's lawyer, Mary O'Rourke, had \\"confrontational exchanges\\" with Sutton, resulting in him calling Freeman \\"spineless\\" before leaving the tribunal. Tensions between Sutton and Freeman were high throughout the tribunal and the latter did not return to the tribunal after the premature leave. After admitting to 18 of the 22 allegations against him, Freeman requested to have the remaining four dropped in early December, but the tribunal refused. Freeman maintained that he did not order the drug \\"knowing or believing that it was intended for an athlete\\". The tribunal was due to restart on 28 April 2020 as O'Rourke was not going \\"to take risks or play games with [Freeman's] health\\", after his absence at many hearings. The tribunal resumed in October 2020. Freeman said he used \\"a screwdriver of blunt instrument\\" to destroy a laptop that may have contained information important to the investigation. Freeman stated that he destroyed the laptop out of fear that information could be hacked, and stated the incident had occurred during period of ill-health. On 8th October 2020 Freeman stated that he secretly took the 30 sachets of Testogel home on the day it was delivered to the National Cycling Centre and washed them down the sink. On 11th October, Freeman clamed that he complained to senior management about alleged misuse of resources by Shane Sutton, including an allegation he spent ¬£6,000 of British Cycling money on personal cosmetic dentistry. Freeman claimed that Sutton demanded that he confess to being the whistle-blower and \\"made threats during an intimidating exchange\\". He also stated that he was asked by ex-medical director Dr Steve Peters to treat senior management and staff as well as riders free of charge. Dr Steve Peters released a statement denying the allegations stating it was \\"simply untrue\\" that he \\"gave the green light to unregulated medicine, out of British Cycling supplies, to be given to senior manageent and selected staff\\". On the 14th October, Freeman admitted to losing medical information from a third computer after the UCI requested blood data from riders after the 2011 Giro d'Italia and the 2011 Tour de France. He stated that he didn't loose the hard drive despite suggesting so in an email sent to the UCI at the time, stating he believed the email was in relation to his inability to gain access to the data on the hard drive.

Gameplay Bladestorm is a fantasy miniatures combat game. The game component was designed by Coleman Charlton, while the sourcebook was designed by Tim Taylor, Peter Fenlon, and John Ruemmler. Interior illustrations were by Michael Hernandez, Sandy Collora, and Ellisa Martin, and cover art was by Angus McBride. Contents Bladestorm comes as a boxed set containing: * 64-page rulebook * 160-page sourcebook * 32-page scenario book * 8-page miniature painting manual * 32-page color guidebook * 22\\" x 17\\" double-sided color map * dice =Character generation= Each player must provide a miniature. In the Basic Game this character has attribute ratings for Movement, Melee Attack, Melee Damage, Defense and Endurance. =Combat= If an attacker is within range of an opponent, it can attack using a number of six-sided dice equal to the attacking character's Melee Attack rating; one or more of the dice must exceed the defender's Defense rating in order to inflict damage. Damage is simply equal to the highest die roll that exceeded the defender's Defense rating. =Magic= Most spells in the game are designed for mass combat, and are cast using a spell point system. Wizards with Power Hues can accumulate additional spell points if the sky turns a particular color during combat. The title of the game is taken from one of the most powerful spells, bladestorm, which takes the form of a massive tornado or an expanding ring that inflicts critical damage on friend and foe alike. Reception In the February 1992 edition of Dragon (Issue #178), Rick Swan called the game \\"a remarkable design that not only features an elegant set of game mechanics but a fully developed fantasy world in which to use them.\\" Swan admired the combat system, calling it, \\"quick and simple, minimizing the need for charts and complicated formulas\\", and thought that the magic system was \\"superb\\". He also liked the Advanced rules, saying that they \\"build on the concepts introduced in the Basic game, adding interesting twists instead of needless complications.\\" Swan did think that the game was best designed for small engagements rather than large-scale combats, and advised avoiding the \\"cumbersome\\" optional rules. He concluded by giving the game a rating of 4 out of 6, saying, \\"the Bladestorm game is terrific fun, a stylish integration of clever mechanics and sparkling background material, highlighted by the best mass-combat magic system on the market... Skillfully written, richly detailed, and endlessly replayable, there may be a better self- contained fantasy miniatures game than the Bladestorm rules, but I‚Äôve never seen it.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1990 Category:Iron Crown Enterprises games ","title":"Bladestorm (board game)"},{"id":"62194637","text":"The Richmond Relief Society Hall is a historic building in Richmond, Utah.

It is part of the North Cascades, a subset of the Cascade Range. Pelton Peak is situated southeast of Cascade Pass in North Cascades National Park near the northern end of the Ptarmigan Traverse. The nearest higher peak is Magic Mountain, to the southwest. The Yawning Glacier rests on its western flank between these two peaks. Surface runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Stehekin River. The mountain's name comes from the Pelton wheel which was used in early mining times, and several mines were located in the vicinity of Pelton Basin, Horseshoe Basin, and Boston Basin. Climate Pelton Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift).Pelton Peak and Pelton Basin from Cascade Pass in summer As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. View from Sahale Arm with Pelton Peak centered and Magic Mountain to right Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

She was launched in 1740, as S√©rieux and fought at the Battle of Toulon before her capture by the British at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747. After being renamed and refitted by the Royal Navy, she entered British service in late 1747. Between 1748 and 1752 she was assigned as a guard ship off the coast of Kent in south- east England. In 1756 she joined the Mediterranean fleet and was heavily damaged at the Battle of Minorca, one of the first naval battles of the Seven Years' War, where she suffered 45 casualties. After undergoing repairs and a further refit, during which she was reduced to a 60-gun fourth rate ship of the line, Intrepid rejoined the Seven Years' War, taking part in the Battle of Lagos and the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. She crossed the Atlantic in 1761, and fought in the West Indies Campaign of the War, featuring in the Siege of Havana the following year. She was broken up at Chatham in 1765. Design and description During the first 25 years of Louis XV of France's reign, beginning in 1715, France built relatively few ships. A sustained period of peace led to low funding for the French Navy, and those ships that were built were designed to be cost effective; maximising their manoeuvrability and armament in order to be able to stand up to the British Royal Navy, which had more ships. As a result, most French third rate ships of the line were built from a formulaic design with 60 or 64 guns dating back to the 1660s. The design was updated slightly in the 1730s to allow an extra pair of guns on each gun deck, but otherwise remained constant. It was to this standard that Ren√© Boyer based his design for S√©rieux in the late 1730s, though Boyer died before the ship could be completed, and it was finished under the supervision of Pierre-Blaise Coulomb. S√©rieux measured long at the gun deck and long at the keel. She had a beam of , a draught of , and a depth of hold of , and a tonnage of 1,286 bm as designed. She was initially carried a crew of 400 men during wartime and 340 at peace, commanded by six officers, but the complement later rose to 460 and 410 during war and peacetime, respectively. S√©rieux was armed with 64 guns, consisting of twenty-six 24-pounders on the lower gun deck, twenty-eight 12-pounders on the upper gun deck, six 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and four 12-pounders on the forecastle. Service =French Navy= S√©rieux was ordered on 6 February 1738, laid down in Toulon on 4 October 1738, and launched just over two years later, on 26 October 1740. She was completed in May 1741. On 19 February 1744, under the command of , she sailed out of Toulon as part of a French fleet which was tasked with escorting trapped Spanish ships past the British blockade of Toulon, leading to the Battle of Toulon. The British and French were not at war, so the French fleet was under orders not to attack the British, but to retaliate if attacked. The Franco-Spanish fleet established a line of battle, with three distinct sections: forward, centre and vanguard. S√©rieux formed part of the central group, which combined both French and Spanish ships. When the British attacked, HMS Berwick should have engaged S√©rieux, but was too far back, and became embroiled with the Spanish ships behind instead, while S√©rieux was able to fire upon her lee side bow. S√©rieux also exchanged fire with Princess Caroline and one of the British flagships, Barfleur. Although the battle was indecisive, the Franco-Spanish fleet was able to escape and deliver troops to Italy to shift the balance of the war. In early May 1747, a pair of French convoys left Rochefort; one intended for India, and the other for North America. A French naval fleet under the command of Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonqui√®re, on board S√©rieux as his flagship and on Invincible provided an escort. A British fleet led by Admiral George Anson sailed to intercept the convoy, and after patrolling the Bay of Biscay, encountered the French fleet on 14 May, north-west of Cape Finisterre in Spain. De la Jonqui√®re ordered his fleet into a line of battle, but they were significantly outnumbered by the British, and after three hours, the entire French naval fleet, including S√©rieux, was captured. =Royal Navy= After her capture on 14 May 1747, S√©rieux was sailed to Portsmouth where she was surveyed just over two weeks later, and subsequently purchased by the Board of Admiralty on 19 August for ¬£8 5s per ton. Two days later, she was renamed HMS Intrepid. She underwent refit between from August until the following March at a cost of over ¬£10,000, and was commissioned in November 1747 under the command of Captain William Parry. A year later, she was placed on guard duties, doing so in Kent, at Chatham from 1749 to 1751, and Sheerness in 1752, before being decommissioned in November that year. After a survey in July 1753 required no repairs, she was eventually recommissioned in September 1755, commanded by Captain James Young. In April 1756, during the prelude to what later became known as the Seven Years' War, the Intrepid left Britain as part of a fleet sailing to the Mediterranean under the command of Admiral John Byng. The French had been menacing British-held Minorca for some time, and on 18 April a large French fleet had established itself off the north-west of the island. They bombarded the island, until Byng's fleet arrived on 19 May. The two fleets were relatively equally matched; the British had 842 guns to the French fleet's 800, and each had around a dozen ships of the line. The next day, at the Battle of Minorca, the fleets met in a wedge; rather than match-up side by side, the British fleet intercepted the French at an angle of around 30 to 40 degrees, meaning that while the ships at the front were engaged, those at the rear were too far from the French to fight. Intrepid, the sixth British ship from the front, was immobilised early in the fighting when her fore-topmast was hit by enemy fire and destroyed. This caused her to fall back out of the line of battle. Byng instructed the 44-gun frigate HMS Chesterfield to lay by Intrepid while the rest of the fleet continued. Ultimately, Byng and his council of war called off the attack, and Minorca fell to the French soon after. During the battle, along with the damage suffered, Intrepid suffered 45 casualties; 9 killed and 36 wounded. Intrepid was part of a large British fleet which defeated the French at the Battle of Lagos in 1759. Four months of refits and repairs during 1757 cost ¬£8,842, during which she was reduced to a 60-gun fourth rate ship. Under the command of Captain Edward Pratten, she was recommissioned in June 1757, and sailed with Hawke's fleet until switching to Anson's the following summer. She was involved with the blockade of Brest in April 1758, where Pratten had command of a small squadron. The crew of the Intrepid spotted a French ship, Raisonnable, and Pratten sent two of his ships to chase her. The British ships successfully captured Raisonnable, which was subsequently commissioned into the Royal Navy. The following year, she was involved in the Battle of Lagos; a British victory over the a French fleet attempting to escape the Mediterranean. Intrepid was one of fifteen British ships of the line which helped Admiral Edward Boscawen capture three enemy vessels and destroy two others. Towards the end of the battle, Boscawen's main aim was to secure the French commander, and so he ordered Intrepid, along with America to seize the enemy flagship, Oc√©an. As Intrepid had already anchored, she was unable to carry out the orders, which America completed alone, destroying the French flagship and capturing its surviving crew. Intrepid lost six men during the battle, while a further ten were wounded. She returned to England with Boscawen's fleet. Two years later, Captain commanded her at the Battle of Quiberon Bay, a decisive naval victory over the French, after which she blockaded the Basque Roads. She crossed the Atlantic to North America in August 1761, and took part in the Havana operations, under the command of Captain John Hale, from June to August 1762, before being decommissioned in 1763. After surveys in May 1764 and June 1765, she was broken up at Chatham from June until August 1765 for ¬£644 10s 2d.

The game is set during World War II and runs on Unreal Engine 4.  Gameplay  Matches play out as 100-player battles between two teams, each consisting of multiple smaller units of up to six players. , two game modes exist in the game: Warfare and Offensive. In both modes, the map is divided into sectors that each team seeks to capture and control. In the Warfare mode, the game is won by either controlling all sectors at a given point in time, or by controlling a majority of them when the timer runs out. In the Offensive mode, a defending team is in control of all sectors at the beginning of the match, and the objective for the opposing side is then to capture all of them before the timer runs out. Communication is intended as a central gameplay aspect by the developers. Each unit may be led by a single officer, who can communicate with other officers and the commander through a \\"leadership\\" voice channel. Similarly, there are unit-only and proximity voice channels as well. As an alternative to voice communication, players also have access to a team-wide text chat.

These white paintings are believed to be products of the Wamia people, who occupied the region before the Wagogo people (the current residents). The paintings, which depict cattle, human figures, stools, gourds, a bird, and an arrow, among other symbols, were supposedly executed during important occasions such as funerals. The Wagogo people, though not fully aware of the original significance of the paintings to the Wamia, have continued to use the sites as sacred locations for rain-making ceremonies. The Bahi paintings are estimated to be at least 340 years old based on the genealogy of the Bahi chief in 1929, which revealed the estimated time of his ancestor Kimanchambogo's arrival in the area.

The show features a present day teenager who awakens a princess from a 1,000-year magical slumber. Season one (Spring 2019) and Season two (Fall 2019) both contain 10 episodes. In June 2019 the series was approved for two more seasons of 10 episodes. Plot Dwight is a present-day teenager who falls into an ancient, underground chamber. He lands on Gretta, a gothic princess who has been magically sleeping for a thousand years. Dwight inadvertently kisses Gretta, breaking the magic spell. This action also awakens her court magician, Baldric, as well as scores of medieval villains, and makes Dwight her de facto champion until her hordes of enemies are defeated. Dwight must deal with new role as protector while helping Gretta assimilate into high school life. Cast and characters *Sloane Morgan Siegel as Dwight, described as a model Generation Z kid: sensitive, open-minded, health-conscious, responsible, and non- confrontational. He's not really interested in becoming a rough and tough champion. If he has to do this job, he's going to do it his way. *Caitlin Carmichael as Gretta who comes from a rough and tough gothic war zone. She has no way of understanding 21st century manners or political climate, and she's not really interested in adapting as all the problems from her world have followed her. She is described as more Wonder Woman than fairy tale princess. *Joel McCrary as Baldric the court magician who placed the spell on Gretta as a last ditch effort to save her life. He is not fond of Dwight as a champion, but is extremely protective of Gretta. *Danielle Bisutti as Witch Hexela. Hexela and Baldric have a complicated past as former lovers. Hexela originally only desires to keep her youth. However when she reconciles with Baldric and Gretta she decides to join the team to keep Gretta safe. She uses her magic to keep the team out of trouble whenever the most dire situations arrive. *Evan Hofer as Chlodwig. Chlodwig was originally Gretta's fiance. Eventually the two agree to be friends, and he becomes good friends with Dwight. When the situation arrives he trains Dwight in knighthood, but his clumsiness tends to put the group in more comedic situations than they hope to face off with.

On January 10, 2017, she was appointed Minister of Democratic Institutions in the 29th Canadian Ministry, headed by Justin Trudeau, becoming the youngest female cabinet minister in Canadian history.  Early life and career  Gould was born in 1987, and grew up in Burlington, Ontario in a family with three brothers. At sixteen, she participated in the Forum for Young Canadians, spending a week in Ottawa learning about the federal government, which she credits as the impetus for her goal of a career in Parliament. After she graduated from M.M. Robinson High School in 2005, she spent the next year volunteering at an orphanage in Mexico, where she met her husband, Alberto Gerones. Upon her return to Canada in 2006, Gould attended McGill University, earning a joint honours degree in political science as well as Latin American and Caribbean studies. Writing her honours thesis on the Canadian Electoral System, she graduated first class honours with distinction in 2010. During her time as an undergraduate student she served as President of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) and helped organize fundraising for humanitarian aid for Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. In 2010, Gould took a job with the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C., working as a consultant in the Migration and Development Program. She is cited as contributing to the 2011 report, International Migration in the Americas: First Report of the Continuous Reporting System on International Migration in the Americas (SICREMI). She subsequently completed a master's degree in international relations at Oxford University. Upon completion of her graduate studies at Oxford, Gould decided to move back to her hometown of Burlington, Ontario. She took a job working as a Trade and Investment Specialist for the Mexican Trade Commission \\"ProMexico\\" in Toronto. Gould held this position for less than a year before announcing her candidacy in the 2015 election at the age of twenty-eight.  Political career  = 2015 Canadian Federal Election = During the election campaign, she attracted minor attention for deleting a three-year-old tweet expressing opposition to the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines ‚Äì eventually not approved by the Trudeau government ‚Äì and to the development of the Alberta tar sands in general.Joanna Smith, Liberal candidate Karina Gould deletes ‚Äòtar sands‚Äô tweet, The Toronto Star, August 11, 2015.

Retrieved 2 December 2015. During her time in this role she chaired a foreign-aid strategy session at the Health Systems Research Conference in Vancouver (2016) where stated that it was important to empower women and girls within a feminist approach to foreign-aid. During Barack Obama's July 2016 state visit to Ottawa, he gave a shoutout to Burlington, where his brother in law lives, during his address to Parliament, prompting Gould to wave for the cameras, in what Macleans called her most high-profile moment. = Minister of Democratic Institutions = On January 10, 2017, she was named Minister of Democratic Institutions, succeeding Maryam Monsef. She also became the President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. These appointments made her the youngest female cabinet minister in Canadian history. Despite electoral reforms being a pledged mandate of Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau's 2015 campaign, with this appointment such electoral reforms were no longer part of the Minister of Democratic Institutions mandate. Instead, Gould's mandate included commitments to strengthen Canada's democratic institutions and improve Canada's democratic process by addressing and cyber threats like online meddling and the spread of disinformation from social media giants and combating foreign interference. Gould has been credited as being instrumental in not both passing and defending Bill C-76 or Elections Modernization Act, which made significant amendments to the Canadian Elections Act, including numerous accommodations for voter accessibility, restrictions on third-party interference on election campaigns, and a prohibition on spending by foreign entities during elections. = 2019 Canadian Federal Election = Running as the incumbent in the 2019 Canadian federal election, Gould was re-elected as the Member of Parliament representing the Burlington, Ontario riding.

Gould has been outspoken about the obstacles facing women in politics, stating in a 2019 interview, \\"In 2015, I'd say the No. 1 thing people asked me at the door was how old I was and why I thought I could jump into politics at such a young age...

The hotel was a popular destination in Los Angeles, serving US politicians, Hollywood actors, and members of the American Mafia. Cockatoo gained a reputation for being a gathering place for the elites in Los Angeles. The 210-room hotel featured intricate European furnishings, grand banquet halls, and an eccentric bar. The hotel was founded in 1958, when a notorious American Mafia member Andrew Lococo built the hotel. Cockatoo Inn quickly became popular in Los Angeles. Guests of the hotel include John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Mickey Rooney. An acting US Attorney identified Andrew Lococo as a prominent member of the American Mafia, making Lococo subject to federal investigations. Shortly afterward he was convicted of horse race-fixing, gambling violations, and perjury in a grand trial. Lococo proceeded to sell the hotel two years after his conviction. The hotel business continued to prosper, but by the late 1980s, the hotel began to suffer and became bankrupt in 1991. The next corporation to buy the bankrupt hotel was also unable to make the Cockatoo Inn profitable and sold the property to investors from China. The Cockatoo inn soon fell into disarray and shut down, prompting Chinese investors to sell the property to property developers. After purchasing the property in 2004, the developers demolished the hotel with plans for a new three hotel complex to replace it. The project was met with neighborhood appeals however, the developers were able to approve the project and pushed forward with its construction. During the complex's construction in 2009, the hotel industry in Los Angeles was suffering with average daily rates for hotels falling 15% in just 2009 alone. Despite obstacles of slow construction, franchising regulations, economic downturn, and financing troubles Pournamdari completed the three hotels. In 2019 plans were announced for an expansion of the complex for a total of seven hotels and 760 rooms. The complex currently includes a Candlewood Suites and Holiday Inn Express, with the \\"Cockatoo\\" name having been adopted by a Comfort Inn across from the complex on Acacia Avenue.

Mazurek has abandoned neither melody, harmony nor rhythm, and the band's hard-bop origins can also be discerned from time to time ... Throughout, Rob and the band shrewdly employ uncommon elements - the sound of a glockenspiel or bamboo flute, for example - to accentuate their singular point of view. Everyone is on the same page, and those who fancy Jazz that veers slightly off the beaten path without self-indulgent cerebralism should find this picturesque Playground well-suited to whatever musical byways they might care to pursue\\"Bowers, J.

The type and only species is Nemegtonykus citus. It is only the second alvarezsaur known from the Nemegt Formation, the other being Mononykus. Discovery Size comparison In 2008, the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur Expedition at the Altan Uul III site in the Gobi Desert excavated a dense concentration of theropod skeletons. Some of these were of Gobiraptor as well as a yet undescribed oviraptorid but three were of Alvarezsauridae. One specimen, MPC-D 100/206, was considered cf. Mononykus sp. but the other two represented a species new to science. In 2019, the type species Nemegtonykus citus was named and described by Lee Sungjin, Park Jin-Young, Lee Yuong-Nam, Kim Su-Hwan, L√º Junchang, Rinchen Barsbold and Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar. The generic name combines a reference to the Nemegt with a Greek ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒæ, onyx, \\"claw\\", analogous to Mononykus. The specific name means \\"the fast one\\" in Latin. The holotype, MPC-D 100/203, was found in a layer of the Nemegt Formation (perhaps late Campanian - early Maastrichtian). It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains six back vertebrae, two sacral vertebrae, twenty-one tail vertebrae, five ribs, the left shoulder girdle, the left pubic bone, parts of other pelvic bones, the left hindlimb and the right shinbone. The left hindlimb and the tail were articulated. The other bones were associated on a small surface.

They are also sometimes used as auxiliary vessels to larger warships for piracy and coastal raids.  Etymology  The name \\"kakap\\" comes from Malay word meaning \\"spy\\", \\"scout\\", \\"lookout\\". Thus, the name means \\"type of boat used for scouting\\".  Description  Kakap resemble pangajava but are smaller and lighter. It also uses a mast and rectangular tanja sail. The boards and planks on the hull are not nailed with iron nail, but are attached using a wooden dowel technique and reinforced with rattan bonds. Larger kakap is able to reach eight meters in length and able to carry 10 crews. The kakap jeram's hull is planked and built with frames, made by meranti (dipterocarp) wood. It has carved figurehead and ornamented sternpost. A washstrake made of bamboo splits sewn together with bamboo withies, and held in position by lashings. A heavy beam is fitted forward and used for winding the anchor cable and bitting it. The steering gear consist of a paddle held on the quarter on a stout upright and held at the neck by a rattan lashing. It has 1 mast with junk sail. Average length of mast is 13 ft (4 m). The length of a kakap jeram is about 13 ft (4 m), the width is 7 ft (2.1 m), with 3 ft (91 cm) depth. It has a freeboard of 1 ft (30 cm) and crew of 3 men.  Role  In Selangor coast, kakap is used as fishing boat, precisely under the name kakap Jeram. Jeram is the name of big fishing village in the Kuala Selangor district. Its name can be interpreted as \\"Jeram scouter\\". For piracy activities, kakap does not sail alone and often accompanies penjajap and is used as an observer in piracy activities. If merchant ships encountered this boat, a penjajap or lanong must be hiding around the waters. Kakap is also suitable to be used to go along the beach and sail to the river estuary. If attacked, kakap can land easily on the beach or riverbank to make it easier for the crew to escape to the mangrove or palm forest area while carrying the boat with them. Sea people use kakap which can contain 20 people used for piracy activities at sea.Mohamed Zen (2002). Orang Laut: Studi Etnopedagogi.

The street is closed to through traffic at Bopa Plads, a small square located at the intersection with Randersgade. History August Neubert's Textile Factory The area south of Jagtvej and east of √òsterbrogade was up until the middle of the 19th century a rural area known as Slaftervangen (\\"The Butchers' Pasture\\"). It was owned by the City but leased by the Butchers' Guild and used for livestock fattening. In 1852, the so- called demarcation line was moved from Jagtvej to The Lakes, paving the way for redevelopment of the area. The older, eastern section of the street was initially called Batterivej (\\"Battery Road\\". The name referred to Kalkbr√∏nbderihavns Batteri (\\"Limery Dock Battery\\", a coastel fortress constructed at the site in the 1850s as part of Copenhagen's new defensive ring. J. Kornbecks Asfaltfabrik opened in the street in 1865. In 1867, it was joined by August Neubart's Textile Factory. A small working-class neighbourhood of two-storey buildings developed around the factories. In 1886, the street was extended to √òsterbrogade and renamed Viborggade. The new name was in line with a naming scheme introduced by Thorvald Krak according to which streets in the area were named after Danish market towns. The industrial activities continued for more than a hundred years. J. Kornbecks Asfaltfabrik had by 1897 been taken over by Tr√¶kompagniet, a wood factory, and by 1920 by K√∏benhavns Smergelfabrik. The factory in Voborggade was decommissioned when a new one in Maribo on Lolland was occupied in 1975. August Neubert's Textile Factory was later taken over by Pia Lys, a manufacturer of candles. The factory was destroyed in a fire in 1982. Notable buildings A few of K√∏benhavns Smergelfabrik's former buildings have survived. The building at No. 70 is from 1907 and was designed by Anton Rosen. Transport The western end of the street is located approximately halfway between the metro stations at Poul Henningsens Plads (510 m) and Trianglen (590 m).

Biography  = Early life and studies = In 1983 he graduated from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina with a BA in Political Sciences, and in 1985 Grossi joined the Argentine foreign service. In 1997, he graduated from the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International Studies with a MA and PhD on International Relations, History and International Politics. Career Grossi alongside Yukiya Amano in 2011. Grossi started his experience on the nuclear field during a collaboration between the Argentine foreign service and INVAP. Between 1997 and 2000 he was the President of the United Nations Group of Government Experts on the International Weapons Registry, and later became adviser to the Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations on disarmament. From 2002 to 2007 he was Chief of Staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. While working for the United Nations, Grossi visited North Korea's nuclear facilities and participated in several meetings with representatives of Iran to reach an agreement to freeze its nuclear program. During his work for the Argentine foreign service, he was the General Director of Political Coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship, Ambassador to Belgium and the Argentine Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva. Between 2010 and 2013 he served as Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and that last year, President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner assigned him as Ambassador to Austria and International Organisations based in Vienna, concurrent also in Slovakia and Slovenia. In September 2015, the Argentine Government announced the nomination of Grossi as a candidate for Director General of the IAEA, with support from the other countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. But in 2016, the Government of Mauricio Macri withdrew its support to promote Susana Malcorra's candidacy as UN Secretary General. In 2016, he was the President of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In 2017, President Macri announced that he would nominate Grossi for the presidency of the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be held in 2020. = Contribution to the search of ARA San Juan = In November 2017, after the Disappearance of ARA San Juan, Grossi had the idea of reviewing the records of the hydro- acoustic stations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as an alternative to obtain clues about what happened with the submarine. He contacted Lassina Zerbo, the Executive Secretary of the CTBTO, and convinced him of doing such reviews. His efforts paid off: the agency subsequently reported on \\"an underwater impulse event\\" occurred near the last known position of the submarine by the listening posts on Ascension Island and Crozet Islands at . The remains of the ill-fated ship were found a year later, about twenty kilometers from the estimated position based on the cited records. = Director General of IAEA = Grossi with Hayat Sindi of the Islamic Development Bank On August 2, 2019, Grossi was presented as the Argentine candidate to become the Director General of IAEA.

Stage 1 is expected to start major construction by early 2022 and open by late 2025. The possibility of future extensions to the south will be accommodated by providing stub tunnels in the project. The project will include new shared cycle and pedestrian pathways, as well as a new pedestrian bridge across President Avenue. There will also be an upgrade of the Princes Highway and President Avenue intersection. As part of the motorway, a motorway control centre and tunnel ventilation facilities will be built. History =Planning= Princes Motorway, formerly F6 Southern Freeway, is an existing motorway linking Sydney and Wollongong, with its northern terminus currently at Waterfall. There had been previous proposals to extend the F6 northwards into inner Sydney since the 1950s, but no proposal has come into fruition. Only the six-lane Captain Cook Bridge and a short connecting section of Taren Point Road to the south have been built and opened in May 1965 as part of the F6 extension proposal. In the mid 2010s, the F6 extension project was revived under the Liberal-National coalition state government. As part of modifications made during the planning stage of the WestConnex project, stub tunnels was added to the New M5 (now M8) tunnel to allow for an extension connection to it by the F6 extension. In June 2016 the Roads & Maritime Services commenced geotechnical analysis to determine underground rock and soil conditions on the former F6 corridor from Waterfall to the Sydney Orbital Network at Rockdale with a view into developing a possible link between the Princes Motorway and the Orbital Network. It was further reported in October 2016 that any extension would be known as SouthConnex. In June 2017, it was revealed that the state government had reviewed a 3.6 billion dollar train tunnel between Thirroul and Waterfall on the Illawarra railway line that could reduce travel time between Sydney and Wollongong by 22 minutes, but that rail improvements were being sidetracked in favour of improving and extending the Motorway. Later in September 2017, a state government leak showed the extent of the route, to be carried out in multiple sections which would largely follow the original planned route. The leaked document referred to the road as South Link. Sections included tunnels to the northern side of the Captain Cook Bridge, a bridge duplication allowing for motorway traffic to use the existing bridge and local traffic to keep access. To the south of the bridge, a surface motorway would run through current parks and reserves which had been left for the original route, then run along the route of the current Princes Highway with tunnels bypassing the towns of Heathcote and Waterfall before joining the existing freeway. In October 2017, the government announced it will proceed with Stage 1 of the F6 extension, which will run via two 4 km tunnels linking the New M5 (now M8) tunnels at Arncliffe to President Avenue at Kogarah. Stage 1 was originally planned to start construction in 2020 and open to traffic in late 2024. In October 2019, the government announced a name change of the extension to \\"M6 Motorway\\", removing its reference to the defunct F6 name. The renaming to a different route number was likely due to the government deciding not to connect the future southern end of M6 at Loftus to the northern end of the M1 Princes Motorway at Waterfall, resulting in the two motorways to remain separated in the short-term. The completion date of Stage 1 was also pushed back to late 2025, with major construction to begin by early 2022. In December 2019, planning approval for M6 Stage 1 was granted, and the construction contract will be awarded in December 2020. =Construction= Stage 1 is expected to start major construction by early 2022. Prior to the start of major construction, associated construction works began on open spaces near the M6 corridor in August 2020. These include upgrades to Ador Park and McCarthy Reserve at Rockdale, and Brighton Memorial Playing Fields at Brighton-Le-Sands. The upgrades are due to the upcoming construction impacts on the open space and recreational facilities at Rockdale Bicentennial Park.

The first Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) began on December 2, 1958, and the most recent Stand-By Arrangement began on June 20, 2018, and will expire on June 19, 2021. The most recent arrangement approved Argentina to borrow SDR 40,714.00 million, of which Argentina has borrowed SDR 31,913.71 million as of December 10, 2019. Over the past 63 years, Argentina has frequently used the resources of the IMF and holds the record for the largest loan distributed, reaching nearly $57 billion in 2018. However, in 2006 under the leadership of N√©stor Kirchner, Argentina was able to pay off its debts, thus escaping Article IV IMF surveillance. In 2016 under the leadership of Mauricio Macri relations between the IMF and Argentina were reestablished due to the continuous decline of the country's GDP, leading to the 2018 arrangement.  2001 Economic Crisis in Argentina  President Aldolfo Rodriguez Sa√° November 30th marks the beginning of the 2001 economic crisis in Argentina caused by the rising fear at how rapidly the Argentinian peso was being devalued. This crisis was caused in part by the extensive borrowing Argentina implemented during the presidency of Carlos Menem, and the governments dwindling tax revenue. On December 5th, 2001 the IMF made an announcement that they would no longer provide aid due to Argentina's inability to meet the conditionality set by the IMF to receive loans. President Aldolfo Rodriguez Sa√° resigned shortly after the announcement of Argentina‚Äôs default.  2018 Stand-By Arrangement  The 2018 Arrangement allowed Argentina the option to immediately purchase US$15 billion (SDR 10,614 billion) while the remainder of the funds would be disbursed at the discretion of the Executive Board's quarterly review throughout the three year arrangement period. As of 2018, Argentina is ranked the 24th largest economy with a GDP of US$518,475 million, however, the GDP has continued to decline throughout the Macri presidency. The goals of the 2018 Stand-By Arrangement are \\"to strengthen the country‚Äôs economy by restoring market confidence via a consistent macroeconomic program that lessens financing needs, puts Argentina‚Äôs public debt on a firm downward trajectory, and strengthens the plan to reduce inflation by setting more realistic inflation targets and reinforcing the independence of the central bank\\". Furthermore, the goal of the Arrangement is intended to bolster social spending and continue on the trajectory of spending for healthcare that is currently implemented.  2019 Presidential Election  233x233px As of October 27, 2019, Alberto Fern√°ndez won the presidency in the general election (by 48.1% of the vote) against Mauricio Macri among others. Fern√°ndez's presidential term begins December 10, 2019. In a 2019 press briefing with the IMF, it is stated that Alberto Fern√°ndez \\"hopes the IMF will help Argentina pay down its debt\\". Many account Fern√°ndez's victory to the economic failures of his predecessor Mauricio Macri and the fear that Argentina may default on their 2018 SBA as they did in 2001 after mass economic decline within their economy. As of 2019 in Argentina, 25.4% of households live under the poverty line and 35.4% of the general population is living in poverty. Recent telephone communication between the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, and president-elect Alberto Fern√°ndez indicate that both parties hope to ‚Äúpursue an open dialogue for the benefit of the Argentinian people‚Äù.

Bosnia and Herzegovina officially succeeded to the IMF membership of the former Yugoslavia on December 20th, 1995, thereby giving the country access to the quota, as well as outstanding loans and payments, on behalf of Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzogovina, often synecdochically referred to as Bosnia, currently has an IMF quota of 265.20 million SDR (or $364.01 USD). Bosnia is part of the constituency that contains primarily Eastern European countries but is led by the Netherlands and Belgium. Bosnia controls 4,117 votes of the constituencies 273,058 total votes, and the constituency overall accounts for 5.43% of the IMF's total votes. Since Bosnia joined the IMF in 1992, the country has utilized five borrowing arrangements, four of which were under the Stand-By Arrangements (SBA) and one of which was under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The first of the five arrangements was enacted in May of 1998 and the most recent was enacted in September of 2016. As of September 2019, Bosnia has 126.82 million SDR outstanding loans and/or purchases from the IMF.  Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina  Sarajevo, Capital City of Bosnia and Herzegovina As a part of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina was relatively peaceful and prosperous, with \\"high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, good education system and social and medical security for every citizen.\\" This status quo was shattered by the onset of the Bosnian War, which would kill around 100,000 Bosnians and displace around 2.2 million more. The war would also cause an estimated $221 billion USD in material damages to Bosnia's economy and cause the countries GDP to fall by 60%. In the aftermath of the war, Bosnia faced a multi-faceted economic challenge; the struggle to rebuild their infrastructure, as well as begin the transition to an increasingly market based economy instead of their previously mixed economy. As of 2017, Bosnia was $6.69 billion USD in debt and had an unemployment rate of 20.47%.  IMF Intervention in Bosnia  = 1998 = The IMF first intervened in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1998 in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In May of 1998, the IMF approved a loan of 60.6 million SDR (roughly $81 million USD) in an attempt to curtail rampant unemployment, sagging GDP growth, varying levels of inflation around the country. This loan package was under a 12 month Stand- By Arrangement and it made available 24.2 million SDR (roughly $32 million USD) immediately, all of which was dispensed that year. The four main tenants of this 1998 agreement are \\"a fixed exchange rate under a currency board arrangement; budgets that are as supportive as possible of reconstruction and social needs, while avoiding any domestic borrowing; external financial assistance, to help supplement the still-limited domestic resources and promote economic recovery; and acceleration of the transition to a market economy through structural reforms.\\" The structural adjustments included in this agreement include banking reforms, sweeping privatization of enterprise, and the liberalization of trade and market practices. = 2002 = The second IMF intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred in the form of a Stand-By Arrangement that was approved on August 2nd, 2002. This 15 month SBA enabled Bosnia and Herzegovina access to 67.6 million SDR, which is 40% of the countries overall quota. This arrangement was targeted at increasing real GDP growth in the country through a demobilization of the Bosnian military, which will yield annual savings of over 1.15% of the countries overall GDP, as well as measure to strengthen tax policy and improve the countries budget execution. The SBA was also aimed at correcting the balance of payments issues in the country by securing the necessary foreign financing it required. = 2009 = On July 8th, 2009, the IMF approved a 36 month long Stand-By Arrangement program for Bosnia and Herzegovina worth 1.01 billion SDR, or around $1.57 billion USD. This arrangement was aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis on the country, and made 182.63 million SDR, or $282.37 USD, immediately available. Its specific aims were to improve and safeguard the currency regulation board, further consolidate public finances, ensure adequate liquidity and capitalization among public and private banks, and restore confidence in the country as to maintain and ensure sufficient levels of foreign financing. = 2012 = On September 26th, 2012, the IMF approved a 24 month long Stand-By Arrangement program with Bosnia and Herzegovina worth 338.2 million SDR, or around $520.6 million USD. The program immediately made available 50.73 million SDR, or around $78.1 million USD, with the express purpose of addressing domestic structural weaknesses in its economic framework. There are four main aims of this arrangement, the first of which is further strengthening the role of the Fiscal Council in order to improve national policy coordination. The other main tenants of this arrangement are to aid fiscal consolidation through continued structural reforms to maintain medium-term economic stability, to further increase the countries crisis preparedness. With these reforms being implemented, the IMF believed that they will catalyze the economic environment and create an environment that will be more conducive to private sector development. = 2016 = The most recent intervention by the IMF in Bosnia and Herzegovina occurred in 2016 in the form of a three year loan under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The authorized loan amount is 443 million SDR ($612 million USD), which is 167% of the countries quota, and 63.4 million SDR ($87.7 million USD) of this amount was made available to Bosnia immediately. This loan is aimed at addressing a medium term balance of payments issue, as well as increasing overall economic potential and stability. The three main objectives of this program include structural reforms that attempt to boost private sector employment, gradually decreasing public debt, and reviving bank lending and credit growth.

He was a canon and notary of Prague Cathedral. His Annals cover the reign of Vladislav II of Bohemia from his accession in 1140 until 1167.Lisa Wolverton (2016), \\"Vincent of Prague\\", Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle, ed. Graeme Dunphy, Cristian Bratu (Brill). Consulted online on 30 October 2019. Vincent was in the entourage of Bishop Daniel of Prague between 1154 and 1160. He was thus an eyewitness to many important events in the Holy Roman Empire. He took part with Daniel and Vladislav in Emperor Frederick I's campaign in Italy in 1158. When Milan sued for peace, the city first approached the bishops‚Äîincluding Daniel of Prague‚Äîand then Vladislav, who dictated terms of surrender that Vincent wrote down. Rahewin included the text of this surrender agreement in his chronicle.John B. Freed (2016), Frederick Barbarossa: The Prince and the Myth (Yale University Press) p. 227. Vincent's Annals is a strictly chronological account of Vladislav's reign down to 1167, when it abruptly stops. The Italian campaign of 1158 takes up over a third of the work. In his prologue Vincent states his purpose as recording the gesta (deeds) of King Vladislav and the opera gloriosa (glorious works) of his queen, Judith of Thuringia. The unfinished Annals were continued by Gerlach of Milevsko between 1214 and 1222.

It was designed by Alice Aycock. Despite being motionless, Ghost Ballet seeks to achieve 'static animation'. With its location between the downtown area, pedestrian bridge, and stadium, Ghost Ballet has the ability to be observed from many vantage points throughout the central business district of Nashville. The way the piece seems to change shapes while the viewer moves around it from these highly utilized areas reminded Aycock of \\"a certain kind of movement, dance movements\\" which is why she titled it Ghost Ballet.  Composition  The sculpture is approximately 100-feet tall, 100-feet wide and 60-feet deep. A distinct element of the piece is how it is built atop a partially deconstructed gantry crane. According to Aycock, the structure is \\"engineered for hurricane-strength winds, snow and human loads\\". Most of the materials for the metalwork came from Dover Tank and Plate Company of Dover, Ohio while the electrical elements came from Perfection Electricks. These materials include painted steel and aluminum in the form of thermoformed acrylic shapes that are painted in neon hues and periodically lighten up with electronic lights. The spiral red steel is meant to invoke imagery of the use of railroads in Nashville‚Äôs industrial history. The Nashville Office of Arts and Culture describes Ghost Ballet's visuals as follows: > \\"The main structure of the sculpture is arced, red-painted steel trusses > that twist upward from the crane base to form a disconnected spherical > shape. On the ground, a red-painted aluminum ‚Äúturbine whirlwind‚Äù serves as a > visual generator for the swirling trusses above. At night, a glowing neon > fixture illuminates the sculpture‚Äôs center.\\" The piece was completed in 2007; however, a small portion of the piece was rotated in 2008 at the request of Aycock. Aycock was sixty‚Äêtwo years of age when Ghost Ballet for the East Bank Machineworks was officially dedicated in 2008.  Vision  Nashville's skyline and Cumberland River as seen from Ghost Ballet, August 2019 The incorporation of the gantry crane is a testament to the river commerce that was once the lifeblood of Nashville's economy. Thematically combining historical elements of the city with this modern art piece continues with the incorporation of railroad-like twisted red metal that is the hallmark of the Ghost Ballet. In using elements of the mostly departed river and railroad industries of the city, Ghost Ballet seeks to memorialize them while simultaneously acknowledging a transcendence from them. The decision to install the sculpture on existing concrete pillars and steel trusses emphasizes the historical context of the setting. This placement seeks to instill the memory of the industrial history of Nashville‚Äôs once heavily utilized Cumberland River and surrounding railroads. Also, by using an existing foundation the installation is able to further bolster its height without added materials. Furthermore, with its location as a central focal point of Nashville, it itself is a blend of old and new just like the city that continues to grow around it. When proposing the piece to Metro Nashville Arts Commission‚Äôs Competition Committee, Aycock had the following remark: > ‚ÄúThe new metaphorical construction operates as a sign signifying the > activity and energy that was generated on the site and also refers to the > energy and excitement that still exists. The flying trusses and bridgework, > which form the compositional structure of the project, refer not only to the > cranes that once occupied the site but also to the existing bridges, which > span the river. The flying trusses suggest that the viewer experience the > entire site as a work of art ‚Äê a museum without walls.‚Äù As Aycock stated when proposing the piece, the use of lighting throughout the structure is further meant to convey the idea of a ‚Äú'ghost image' of the past as well as the visual manifestation of the energy of the present\\".  Funding  In June 2000, the Metro Nashville Arts Commission‚Äôs (MNAC) public art program was established when the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County established the ‚ÄúPercent for Public Art‚Äù ordinance which earmarked ‚Äúone percent (1%) of the net proceeds of general obligation bonds issued for construction projects to fund public art‚Äù. Despite being completed in 2007, Ghost Ballet for East Bank Machineworks was the first piece commissioned using funds from the city‚Äôs Percent for Public Art Work. According to the Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC), ‚Äúthis new program funded the roughly $500,000 cost of the sculpture, including artist fees, engineering, and fabrication of the sculptural elements; site preparation; restoration of existing steel beams; transportation; signage; installation; and lighting.‚Äù  Reception  Ghost Ballet for the East Bank Machineworks was selected by the Americans for the Arts 2010 Public Art Network's Year in Review 50-Year Retrospective as one of the best 50 public art projects over the past 50 years.\\" Some art historians have praised Aycock for her desire to transform decaying infrastructure into more structures that more greatly contribute to the spirit of modern society.

The show served as the year-end finale for CMLL before Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue, closed down for the winter for renovations and to host Circo Atayde. The shows replaced the regular Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows held by CMLL since the mid-1930s. The main event of the 1983 Juico Final was a two-stage match, starting with a Relevos Suicida (\\"Suicide Relays\\") where the losing team would be forced to fight each other immediately afterwards, with both risking their hair. Hombre Bala and Masakre defeated Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and El Egipico in the Relevos Suicida. Subsequently, Rayo de Jalisco Jr. pinned El Egipico to win the last match of the night. After unmasking El Egipico revealed that his real name was Jose Luis Hernandez. In the third-to-last match of the show Enfermero Jr. defeated C√©sar Curiel, which meant that Curiel had to have all his hair shaved off. The show included four additional matches. Production =Background= For decades Arena M√©xico, the main venue of the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting Circo Atayde occupy the space over the holidays. As a result, CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\".

He especially collected beetles, many from his time spent in Australia. He was one of the founders of the Norwegian Entomological Society, which was established in 1904.  Career  Fischer passed his university entrance exam in 1895. He later attended the Norwegian Military Academy. He graduated in 1903 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Royal College of Technology in Germany. He was employed by the Swedish company ASEA and was involved in the installation of Tyssedal Hydroelectric Power Station and the Notodden Saltpeter Factory. From 1912 to 1925 he worked as the chief engineer at the Swedish‚ÄìAustralian company Gardner Waern & Co. in Melbourne, Australia. He became interested at an early age in nature and insects. In particular, beetles (Coleoptera) caught his interest. During his stay in Australia, he caught beetles on his travels to various places on the continent and in the light of powerful arc lamps (the light trap technique). Electric light was quite new at that time, and insects are attracted to light. This made a great impression, and newspapers often printed long articles about the phenomenon. The number of beetles Fischer captured was far lower than other groups such as butterflies and moths, which are attracted to light sources. His collection included about 3,500 species, but this was only a fraction of the total species available. He stated that \\"being an entomologist in Australia was like being a cow in a meadow of clover.\\" In 1925, Fischer had to leave Australia due to health problems, and he moved back to Norway. He still had contact with Australian entomologists and he organized his large collection of Australian beetles. His large beetle collection and specialized literature can be found in the insect collection at the Natural History Museum in Oslo today. At the time it was assembled, this collection was of a size that few other museums outside Australia had. He shared some of his experiences in an article in the Norwegian Journal of Entomology. Fischer created many illustrations of insects in his diaries between 1900 and 1904. During his stay in Australia, Fischer suffered from Spanish flu and then pneumonia, forcing him to return to Norway. He died on February 8, 1930, after a long illness.

A Geographical Indication in the north-east of the South Island, it covers the entire Marlborough Region and the Kaik≈çura District of the Canterbury region, but in practice the vineyards are concentrated around the Blenheim and Seddon townships. Internationally, Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is recognised as world class; wine writers such as Oz Clarke and George Taber have described it as the best in the world.  History  Early settlers in Marlborough planted vines as early as the 1870s. A small block of Brown Muscat was planted in 1873 by David Herd, but in 1931 his son pulled up the last of the vines, and no others were recorded in the region for the next forty years. Commercial wine-making began in earnest only in 1973 when the first large-scale vineyards were planted by Montana Wines, at the time New Zealand's largest producer (now Brancott Estate, owned by Pernod Ricard). Meanwhile in 1975 Daniel Le Brun, a Champagne maker, emigrated to New Zealand to begin producing m√©thode traditionelle in Marlborough. Wineries in the Marlborough region were producing outstanding Sauvignon Blanc by the early 1980s, and in 1985 the Sauvignon Blanc from Cloudy Bay Vineyards finally garnered international attention and critical acclaim for New Zealand wine. Wine writer George Taber recounted in 2006 that Cloudy Bay is \\"what many people consider to be the world's best Sauvignon Blanc\\" and Oz Clarke wrote that New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is \\"arguably the best in the world.\\" The suitability of the region and later success of Daniel Le Brun's sparkling wines were also sufficient to attract significant investment from Champagne producers. File:NZ vineyard area by grape variety.png New Zealand's plantings of Sauvignon Blanc experienced enormous growth in the 21st century, driven almost exclusively by investment in the Marlborough region. It expanded from of vineyard area in 2003 to in 2018, a five-fold increase in just 15 years.  Climate and geography  The soils in the Wairau Valley and the wine-growing districts surrounding Blenheim are primarily free-draining alluvial gravels. The valley is situated between the Richmond Ranges to the north and the Wither Hills to the south, which protect it from extreme weather conditions. These two factors make the valley ideal for viticulture. The climate is usually sunny and warm in summer and autumn, resulting in a long growing season, and the cool night-time sea breezes provide the temperature variation required for good characterful wines. It can also be very dry, and younger vines often require some degree of irrigation. Extensive planting has been undertaken on the river terraces and flood plains on the valley floor, although some wineries are using organic practices to also dry-farm vines on north-facing hill slopes.  Sub-regions  Broadly, there are three sub-regions. The Wairau Valley is the river flood plain around the town of Blenheim, with deep alluvial gravel soils and river terraces. The Southern Valleys are to the south, and include the north-facing hill slopes of the Wither Hills, with largely glacial loess soils. Awatere Valley is to the south-east, around the town of Seddon, with a generally cooler climate. It accounts for about a third of the total Marlborough vineyard area.  Winemaking and regulations  Marlborough was established in 2018 as a New Zealand geographical indication (GI) under new legislation. In the same year, several Marlborough wineries formed Appellation Marlborough Wine to further protect the integrity and quality standards of Marlborough wines through a certification process. To qualify, wines must be made entirely from sustainably grown grapes from Marlborough, comply with cropping rates set annually, and be bottled in New Zealand. M√©thode Marlborough, a collaboration of sparkling wine producers. Marlborough also hosts significant production of m√©thode traditionelle sparkling wine made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, sufficient to attract investment from large Champagne producers Mumm, Deutz, Mo√´t & Chandon (which now owns Cloudy Bay) and Veuve Clicquot. In 2013 several Marlborough producers established M√©thode Marlborough, a collaborative organisation to standardise and promote the brand both domestically and internationally.

According to Lieutenant General Apollo Galafeev, on February 15, 1842, a Tsarist detachment led by Lt. Col. Sulimovsky and a Chechen detachment led by Naib Shamil Akhverdy-Magom took place near Bolshaya Yandyrka. A detachment of the Ingush regular police fought on the side of the Russian troops. Among the 23 Chechens captured was Taymaskha Gekhinskaya (Khalid Oshaev disputes the number of prisoners. According to him, two seriously wounded Chechens were taken prisoner, besides Taymaskha). The prisoners were sent to Vladikavkaz. Emperor Nicholas I became aware of the capture of Taimaskha. Since she was known to him, on his orders, Taimaskha was taken to the palace in her national attire, in which she fought. She was given money to travel to St. Petersburg and purchase clothes. On the road, she was accompanied by a Cossack officer Fedor Grigoriev. The officer was ordered not to take his eyes off her, not to turn off the indicated route and, in case of illness, to escort her to the nearest hospital. Taimaskha was thanked by the Emperor as a sign of admiration for her courage and released.

Gekhinskaya spent three weeks in St. Petersburg. On October 4, she was taken to Stavropol, and then to the Grozny fortress. Although Taimaskha's Gekhi native village was not far away, she was not allowed to go home. She filed a petition in which she announced her desire to return the gold chain presented to her by the Empress and to receive its value from the treasury. This desire caused a great commotion among the Caucasian authorities and reached the emperor. In the end, she was allowed to return to her native village.

The house on the eastern slope of a steeply sloping slope of the Ri√ütal, northeast above the old town, located on Mettenberger Weg 17 was planned and built for Werner Schmitz. The larger house with the address Mettenberger Weg 15 was also planned and built by Hugo H√§ring for the father of Werner Schmitz, Guido Schmitz a weaving miller working in the silk mill. The entry to the Hugo- H√§ring-Haus is on the upper floor. The core of the building is a two-storey building with a floor plan in the form of an angle. The one leg of the angle is directed with its long side of the south side and takes up the living rooms. The other, branching off to the north, the staircase and the side rooms. A south-facing pent roof emphasizes the opening towards the sunlight. Haring was not allowed to build during the Nazi period. He occupied himself at this time and later in theoretical writings with architecture. So he wrote about the design process when creating a floorplan in general: > \\"It's about building the house from the inside, starting with the living > processes of living ....

Conventional- ended paduwang is at the front, bifid-ended paduwang is at the back. Paduwang (also known as bedouang) is a traditional double-outrigger vessel from Madura, Indonesia. It is built with planks instead of single log, and used for fishing, trading and transport of people and goods near Madura island.Stenross. (2007). p.66. In the 19th century, Paduwang was a popular fishing craft in East Java.  Etymology  According to Horridge, the word ‚Äúpaduwang‚Äù have its roots from word wa, wangka, waga, wangga, and bangka of Austronesian languages. The term is associated with outrigger perahu or small perahu. The name bedouang is used by western observer such as admiral Fran√ßois-Edmond P√¢ris, possibly a mispronunciation of the name.  Description  Paduwang had two short masts, one is on the bow and the other is about 1/3 of the length behind. The rigging is using lete rig, which has upper yard (called pebahu) and lower yard (pekaki). Pebahu is always supported by bamboo support pole (called sokong or supak).Stenross. (2007). p.272. The foresail is mounted on a short mast, while the mainsail has no mast. The mainsail is kept in position by vangs and other ropes attached to its yard.H. H. Frese. (1956).

The hull is built on a dugout keel, both ends closed by simple vertical board. Paduwang only had 1 rudder, held by a rope, moored to a board. The rudder is always positioned under the direction of the wind, with such configuration that it can be switched to other side easily. Small paduwang is only 5 m in length, while large transport paduwang had a small deckhouse at the middle of the hull, and is about 14-16 m long. Paduwang can also be propelled using paddles. Large paduwang disappeared in the early 20th century, not long after the emergence of golekan.

Their major label debut, it was released by Century Media Records on 25 October 2019 in digital formats while a manufacturing problem delayed the physical release until 8 November 2019. Background and promotion The band went into the studio not long after the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive anniversary tour in which the band played the iconic debut album in its entirety for various dates around the world. Many critics suggested the tour was highly influential to the sound of Daemon with many comparing it to that album. The album was also released on the back of the Lords of Chaos semi- biopic movie, giving the band a boost in popularity and interest. During promotional interviews for the album, Necrobutcher claimed he was On [his] way to kill Euronymous but Varg beat [him] to it, and also claimed that the Norwegian Police were aware of Vikernes' plot to kill Euronymous, stating: But little did I know that the Norwegian police already knew that Count Grishnackh [Varg] was going down also to kill him. Because they bugged his phone, and he actually talked about this killing before he went to Bergen so the cops already knew that he was coming, so they probably were thinking to themselves, ‚ÄòWe didn‚Äôt nail this guy for the church burnings, so let‚Äôs nail him for murder, and get rid of this f‚Äìking guy in Oslo the same time.‚Äô So that‚Äôs basically what happened.

Children usually learn concepts through concept formation method. In this method children observe many examples of the concept about which the concept will be formed, follow all the processes stated above and finally generalize to arrive at the concept. This is how the children formulate the concepts of cat, dog, ball etc. Here the observation of the objects will be first time in life. Concept formation provides students with the opportunity to explore ideas by making connections and seeing relationships between items and information. This approach helps students to develop their abilities to recall and discriminate among key ideas to see commonalities and identify relationships. Concept formation lessons can be highly motivational because students are provided with an opportunity to participate actively in their own learning, the thinking process involved helps them to create new and expanded meaning. The teacher is the initiator of the activity and guides students as they move co-operatively through the task. In this approach students are given data about a particular concept. These data may be generated by the teacher or by the students themselves. Students are encouraged to classify or group information and to give description labels to that grouping. By linking examples to the labels and by explaining the reasoning the students form their own understanding of the concept. Hilda Taba: The first phase of inductive thinking model is an example of a concept formation strategy; concept formation is the basis for inductive thinking model. It requires presentation of examples. Concept formation is the process of sorting out given examples into meaningful classes. In inductive thinking model students group examples together on some basis and form as many groups as they can, each group illustrate a different concept. According to Hilda Taba, concept formation process involves three steps: 1. Identifying and enumerating data that are relevant to the problem (observation); 2. Grouping these data on the basis of some similarity (categorization); and 3. Developing categories and labels for the groups (conclusion). To engage students in each of these activities Taba invented teaching moves (steps) in the form of questions. These questions are matched to particular type of activities. For example the questions: ‚ÄúWhat did you see?‚Äù might induce the students to enumerate a list (listing). ‚ÄúWhich belong together?‚Äù is likely to make students group things that have been listed. ‚ÄúWhat would we call this group?‚Äù it induces students to develop labels or categories. The purpose is to make students expand the conceptual system with which they process information. Reference: 1\\\\.

Still working for Electro- Harmonix, Cockerell designed one of the first digital delay pedals with looping capabilities in 1980, the Instant Replay, followed by the 2 Second Digital Delay in 1981 and the 16 Second Digital Delay in 1982. Work that later made him go to work in Akai where he was involved in the design of samplers like the S612, S900, S1000 and the famous MPC60. He is currently working for Electro-Harmonix as a Chief Design Engineer.  Career  = EMS = Cockerell was working as a medical technician when a coworker of him, Mark Dowson, introduced him to Peter Zinovieff who was looking for someone with a technical skill to make the sounds that Peter wanted to create. The company's first commercial synthesizer, the VCS 3, designed by David Cockerell, was produced in 1969, followed after the Synthi KB1 in 1970, also designed by Cockerell. = Electro-Harmonix = Cockerell went to visit some friends in New York in 1974 where he met Electro-Harmonix's founder Mike Matthews, who made Cockerell an offer to work for him as a Chief Design Engineer.

The post-and-beam house is believed to have begun with a stone cellar dug into a hill around 1640 by Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake who purchased \\"Elizabeth's Neck\\" (Greenwich Point) that year and the house is situated on Greenwich Cove. Around 1645 Feake constructed a one-room-over-one- room house on top of the cellar before selling the property to Jeffrey Ferris in 1653. Around 1660 Jeffrey Ferris added a lean-to to the back of the house giving the house its saltbox shape. In 1689 Ferris' son, James Ferris, constructed the final major addition, to the right side of house, leaving the house with a two-over-two form and extended lean-to, and Ferris installed new windows, one of which has survived intact and was discovered during the 2018 restoration.

The series was first published by Simon & Schuster between 2012 and 2014. West Toronto, when annexed in 1909 Corner of Dundas Street and High Park Avenue, The Junction, July 2013 Synopsis =The Placebo Effect= In a prologue set in 1988, Decker Roberts, aged 22, stands in Chartres Cathedral, where he meets a monk who asks whether he has decided to stay. Brother Malcolm offers to teach him everything he knows and in return, the cathedral and ministry will become his home, and he will avoid \\"the room with no windows ‚Äì and the hanging man\\". The young Roberts knew then, as the older Roberts knows now, that the monk spoke the truth, as he always knows when anyone speaks the truth, a unique benefit of his particular form of synaesthesia, a neurological condition. For years, this talent has proven to be a lucrative sideline to his regular work as a theatre director and acting coach based in The Junction, Toronto. Roberts is hired by companies because he can tell them if their potential recruits are lying. He leads a successful double life, carefully compartmentalized with a myriad of alter egos. His inner life, however, is one of sorrow, having lost his wife to ALS and missing his estranged son, Seth. He is also disturbed by the excessive number of churches in the area. He believes they are there to prevent an evil from re- appearing. He senses its existence when he walks the streets and feels the Junction \\"hunch around him in the cold.\\" Annette Street Public Library When homeless synaesthete Michael Shedloski arrives in the Junction, he has a vision of a boy dangling from a lamp post across from the public library on Annette Street, grasping a rope at his neck, trying in vain to get his last breath. The event is real, but took place a century earlier. Hearing of this, Roberts knows that the hanged boy is a \\"marker\\" ‚Äì that there must be a portal in the Junction. Then he realizes that its name does not really refer to a railroad depot as most of its residents believe, but rather to a point of connection, a connection between this world and another, and the hanged boy marks the access. Henry-Clay Yolles, the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, exploits Sedloski's unique talent for determining perfect ratios, allowing the company to know how many placebo pills can be included in a prescription as a cost saving measure without affecting the drug's efficaciousness. Yolles Pharmaceuticals is now interested in Roberts. A resentful Shedloski publicly protests his dismissal by Yolles and tries to warn Roberts, but is killed. Yolles now needs to eliminate Roberts because he might discover the truth about its new product. Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., the National Security Agency is also interested in Roberts as a means of evaluating statements by terrorists. Yslan Hicks, who studies synasethetes, has been observing him. The NSA becomes more involved as it perceives its potential asset is threatened. Narrowly escaping death when his house burns down, it does not occur to Roberts that it was no accident. Next, his finances are crippled, and his studio condemned. He realizes that he must have heard something in one of his sessions that he should not have, and goes on the run trying to work out why he has been targeted and by whom. His escape route takes him from coast to coast, north to south, through small towns and big cities across North America, as both pursuer and pursued. As Roberts draws closer to his quarry, he grudgingly agrees to work with and for the NSA. Agent Yslan Hicks tells him his friend Crazy Eddie betrayed him, but he refuses to believe it. =A Murder of Crows= Fourteen months have passed since the incident with Yolles Pharmaceuticals. Roberts has spent some time applying his talent in Las Vegas, simultaneously seeking information about Seth, who is suffering from am aggressive form of cancer of the bladder. Crazy Eddie is still trying to win back his daughter, and to do so he intends to incriminate Ira Charendoff, the lawyer to whom he betrayed Roberts over a year earlier. In order to clear the playing field and keep the NSA off his best friend's back at the same time, Eddie sends Roberts to South Africa. A close eye is being kept on both men and others like them by the NSA with a view to using them for combating terrorism. In upper New York State, the elite science-focused Ancaster College prepares for spring graduation. Aggrieved professor Neil Frost and resentful janitor Walter Jones conspire to exact violent revenge against the faculty and students. Bombs explode at the graduation ceremony killing over 200 people, the worst terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. Led by the NSA, America's security forces descend upon Ancaster, and track down Roberts in South Africa, using Seth's whereabouts to persuade him to return to the United States and determine the veracity of hundreds of video statements. Over the course of the work, Roberts shows that his gift has limitations: while he can tell that someone is not telling the truth, he cannot say whether that person is lying, that is, if an untruth is deliberate. Worse, since almost everyone in the videos is not telling the truth about something, it is hard to determine who may have been involved. Roberts learns that the NSA has been tracking other people like him, including a tiny childlike woman named Viola Tripping who can reveal the final thoughts of a deceased person just before death. Agent Yslan Hicks takes the two of them to the crime scene at Ancaster so that Tripping can read the victims' final thoughts and Roberts can tell if those statements were truthful. Roberts privately pieces together what happened, but withholds this information from the NSA. In the course of their work, Tripping also provides Roberts with a vision of his estranged son Seth's whereabouts ‚Äî in Namibia. Dundas Street and Keele Avenue, The Junction =The Glass House, or, When the Moon's Too Thin for Stories= In Namibia, Roberts struggles to find his way in isolation. Seth, whose cancer is advancing swiftly, is kidnapped by WJ, a musical prodigy who is unable to feel and who desperately wants to learn from Seth's special abilities. The kidnapping sets a mysterious chain of events in motion. Seth, it seems, is the key to everyone's plans: his inherited \\"gifts\\" are more powerful than his father's, and there are many who will do anything to control them. Yslan Hicks desperately needs to find both father and son to deal with an urgent threat faced by the NSA. When the trails run cold, Hicks turns to Roberts' old friends for help, but they quickly find themselves confronting an ancient conspiracy, one that draws the synaesthetes, via \\"waking dreams\\" of a \\"glass house\\", back to The Junction, the place where a young boy was killed by hanging shortly after 1900. Roberts, his friends, and the NSA are inexorably drawn towards a conclusion that will change both themselves and the world around them. Queen West Setting The Placebo Effect features such Junction landmarks as Squirly's and the Swan Diner (both on Queen West). Rotenberg spoke of the Junction area as \\"a different world\\" than the Greater Toronto Area: \\"For years we had the stockyards just around the corner, hot dog Tuesday was unbelievable... all those churches‚Äîso many churches in such a small area.\\" referring to Annette Street. Rotenberg wondered if something happened in the neighbourhood that led to the building of so many churches, and did some research, discovering that some police records disappeared when the area was ammalgamated with Toronto: \\"I thought, 'What awful thing happened here that some police records were lost?'\\" and grew suspicious that ammalgamation provided a convenient opportunity to destroy evidence of a crime by \\"wealthy people\\". These ideas are explored in some depth in The Placebo Effect. While the initial setting for the series is The Junction, a lot of the action in the first novel actually takes place in New York City, and its landmarks figure prominently. Rotenberg lived there for about a dozen years, and he still knew the city better than he did Greater Toronto. Much of the action in the second novel also takes place in other parts of Canada and the United States, in the wake of a terrorist attack at a college in Upper New York State. As well, the plot of the second and third novels takes the protagonist to South Africa and Namibia. Characters =Decker Roberts= Series protagonist Decker Roberts is a middle aged acting coach and a widower, with a \\"strained\\" relationship with his son Seth. He has a neurological condition called synaesthesia, which, in his case, has led to the innate ability to \\"see if people are telling the truth\\". > Roberts is a synesthete; he \\"sees\\" language and can tell when people are not > telling the truth, but only just. He sees designs and lines that define > absolute truth and an absolute lie, but the nuances evade him. If the > speaker tells a lie he truly believes to be truth, Decker sees \\"truth.\\" When he hears a statement he can close his eyes and the patterns he sees tell him if the statement is true. When the ability manifests, Roberts senses \\"a stream of cool, clear air above him ... something heavy in his right hand and a coldness.\\" He sees \\"a series of squiggly lines that appear in his line of vision when someone is talking\\". Despite his unique insight, or perhaps somehow because of it, Roberts is repeatedly told he is a \\"terrible liar.\\" Rotenberg said of the character that he is an \\"outsider\\" and a \\"loner\\", and, \\"as in all my previous novels wants desperately to be part of his society but also fights to keep intact those things that make him special and apart.\\" He dislikes police officers and the National Security Agency he grudgingly works for, as he \\"distrusts authority of any sort\\" He has \\"used his head to keep ahead of the inherent violence all around him\\", not because he is \\"a weakling or a coward\\"; rather, he \\"sees and understands the diminishing returns of violence.\\" Only his \\"closest friends\\" know about his ability, which he has used for years to supplement his income through a sideline working for companies as a \\"human lie detector\\" screening potential new employees. He keeps his identity a secret from these employers through \\"a myriad of alter egos.\\" The notion that there may be others of \\"his kind\\" only dawns on him slowly, and \\"that he needs to find them to understand who and what he is.\\" Steven Patrick Clare observes: \\"By day he seems sociable, liked and respected by his peers and pupils. After hours, however, he seeks solace with select company, often through synesthesia social-media sites.\\" On more than one occasion Roberts says to himself: \\"You are from them, but not of them\\", as though he thinks of himself as other than, or perhaps better than, \\"his kind\\", other synaesthetes. Roberts also comes to believe that each time he uses his gift \\"someone close to him gets hurt.\\" His wife's last words to him were, \\"What have you done, Decker: What have you done?\\" Roberts teaches acting at the Pro Actors Lab, the institute founded by Rotenberg and where he was still teaching at the time the novels were written. Roberts even directed a couple of plays on Broadway, the same as Rotenberg. It is not the first time Rotenberg makes use of \\"autobiographical details\\": in the Zhong Fong novels there is a Canadian director, Geoffrey Hyland, who teaches \\"precisely\\" what Rotenberg did and directs \\"exactly\\" what he directed, and who in turn was taught by Toronto-based Charles Roeg, who can always tell when people are telling the truth. =NSA agents= Yslan Hicks Special Agent Yslan Hicks, \\"a young blond woman with almost translucent eyes,\\" responsible for monitoring Roberts and other synaeesthetes like him. She often makes reference to her resemblance to the fictional character Clarice Starling. When introduced, she \\"plays by the rules\\" of the NSA, but her time spent with Roberts influences her: she can no longer lie, and turns introspective, wondering she played by the rules \\"when the NSA essentially operates without them,\\" and when the phenomenon exhibited by Roberts \\"can't be explained by logic.\\" Leonard Harrison Head of the NSA Leonard Harrison is described as a Tommy Lee Jones \\"without the snark\\". =Synaesthetes= Seth Roberts Seth Roberts is the protagonist's son. His mother died of ALS. Nineteen years old in The Placebo Effect, the younger Roberts resents his father, apparently blaming him for his mother's death; he refers to his mother's last words when he writes a message to his father: \\"This is what happens when you get close to people Dad. Stay away from me.\\" The young man has inherited the same neurological condition, and his talents \\"may be even greater than his father's.\\" Like his father, he is being tracked by the NSA, among others. Crazy Eddie A close friend of Decker Roberts and \\"fellow synaesthete\\", their relationship \\"goes back a very long time and they obviously have a special understanding between one another, often not needing to ask for explanations or give details.\\" Eddie is described by critics variously as a \\"technology whiz\\", computer \\"nerd\\", or \\"genius\\". He is not entirely reliable or trustworthy, motivated primarily by a desire to get his daughter back, berating Roberts for not tracking his son down. Michael (Mike) Shedloski Shedloski has a gift for sensing balance, creating unique sculptures from ordinary items; he can determine the ratios that provide balance in many other circumstances. He is homeless. Viola Tripping Introduced in A Murder of Crows, Viola Tripping is presented as \\"simultaneously a woman and a little girl in both appearance and mannerisms\\" who can \\"recite the last thoughts of dead people.\\" =Antagonists= Henry-Clay Yolles The Cincinnati CEO of Yolles Pharmaceuticals and the principal antagonist of The Placebo Effect, he is unscrupulous. Ira Charendoff A lawyer representing parties interested in, or involved with cases against, both Decker Roberts and Crazy Eddie, he manipulates the latter against the former in The Placebo Effect, and remains Eddie's antagonist in A Murder of Crows. Neil Frost and Walter Jones Professor Neil Frost harbours a grudge against his colleagues at Ancaster College, \\"aggravated by a university system that pays him modestly and ever more frustrated at being denied a full professorship.\\" In A Murder of Crows, he conspires to commit heinous crime of mass murder with Walter Jones, a janitor at Ancaster with a scatalogical obsession who stalks female students and comes to display psychopathic tendencies. Jones resents the students and faculty alike for their \\"sense of superiority\\", believing himself to be \\"the equal or better of anyone at the university.\\" Daniel Tammet, a synaesthete autistic savant. WJ Introduced in The Glass House, WJ is a highly talented mathematician who has used his skills with numbers to become wealthy, but is frustrated by his incapacity to enjoy it for lack of feelings: he cannot appreciate relationships, and concepts like beauty or ugliness \\"are but words.\\" Music is at the centre of the man's life: he is a technically skilled cellist but to him the notes are \\"merely sounds\\". Themes =Synaesthesia= Stephen Wiltshire \\"the human camera\\" Outside the speculative fictional world of the novel, a synaesthete is \\"someone whose awareness mixes two or more senses\\"; it is a \\"documented condition\\" which occurs naturally but may also be linked to head injuries. Rotenberg's own conception of synaesthesia elaborates on this as a condition bestowing the person \\"access to the 'other'\\", referring to documentaries he had seen on the synaesthete Daniel Tammet, who is also an autistic savant, as an example, a man with \\"special gifts in mathematics and languages\\", who sees numbers in colours, shapes and sizes and learned conversational Icelandic in a week. Rotenberg also referenced autistic savant Stephen Wiltshire (\\"the human camera\\"), and Ken Peek, the inspiration for the film Rain Man. Doubt as to the accuracy of the term in-universe is introduced at the beginning of A Murder of Crows, when NSA Special Agent Yslan Hicks questions the agency's use of \\"synaesthetes\\" for describing the people she monitors; Leonard Harrison retorts: \\"But we had to call them something.\\" She would rather call them \\"the Gifted\\". Some of them effectively display \\"superpowers\\", some of which potentially qualify as \\"supernatural\\"; the most outstanding example is Viola Tripping, whom Andrew Wilmot characterizes as really \\"a medium for speaking to the dead\\". =Outsiders= A Canadian in the U.S. Rotenberg stated more than once that Roberts is a \\"loner\\" but also an \\"outsider\\", and in more than one sense. When asked by Bill Selnes why the Canadian hero of a Canadian novel criss-crosses the American border so many times, Rotenberg pointed out that a lead character who is Canadian \\"allows a perspective on America that often Americans don't have.\\" Rotenberg lived in the U.S. for a dozen years, his wife is a Puerto Rican American, both children dual citizens. \\"One lives in the States; the other has the knee jerk hatred of America that is pretty common here.\\" > Our relationship with the elephant down there is pretty darned important for > us to understand past the knee jerk stuff. Hence, start in Toronto and work > south. I was born and raised in Toronto, although I left for 15 years I've > been back for 22... and there are times that publishers want to push for > American Heroes. Decker's an outsider, we as Canadians are outsiders to the > world's most powerful entity, crumbling as it may be. Bill Selnes later remarked: \\"Making the hero a Canadian rather than an American when part of the story is set in the United States is so uncommon I do not think I have read another mystery with a comparable hero.\\" An atypical hero Roberts is an atypical literary action hero in that he displays no excessive strength, nor skill with weapons. Asked by Selnes why the character was created \\"with his mind his primary resource\\", Rotenberg said: \\"Partially because he's an outsider. Partially because I've got pretty sick of cops and sleuths altogether. How many times can a guy be hit on the back of the head and get back up on his feet and continue?\\" Agreeing with the reasoning behind Rotenberg's decision, Selnes later wrote: \\"It is tiring to read of fictional heroes being battered about and then swiftly rising again to smite the bad guy. At times I think there is evolving a new rule for thrillers that it cannot be a thriller without a massive body count.\\" Writing =Background= By the early 2010s, David Rotenberg had become established as the author of the Zhong Fong series of mystery novels about a Chinese detective based primarily in the city of Shanghai, and then Shanghai, an epic historical novel also set in Shanghai. Rotenberg was approached by Simon & Schuster to write something else: \\"After what amounts to eight novels about and around China I was ready for a change. I've been back in Toronto since 1987 after an absence of about 18 years. And yet in all that time ‚Äî and all those novels ‚Äî I hadn't written a word about the city.\\" He said \\"it was finally time to look around and try to write about home.\\" =Process= As the Zhong Fong novels are police procedurals, Rotenberg purposefully had his writing space cluttered with images and books when he wrote it: \\"two large modern desks at right angles to each other ‚Äî the whole thing dominated by a large computer monitor. It felt that the job was to produce order from the chaos ‚Äî just as police officers must.\\" For The Junction Chronicles, he felt he needed a different kind of workspace for a different kind of literary work, \\"spare ‚Äî filled with leaps in time and space, often defying normal rules of storytelling\\", pushing the boundaries: \\"Here the job has to do with entering blank spaces ‚Äî creating from whole cloth.\\" It took him seven weeks and three days of \\"intense looking\\" to find the desk for his new office. Made from reclaimed wood, and only a foot and a half deep and about four and half feet long, it is \\"a piece of art in and of itself.\\" The desk has no drawers or file cabinets nor in and out trays, just a small laptop. \\"Even the hard copies of what I've written ... kept in a book shelf out of the room.\\" =Structure and genre= The Junction Chronicles is an episodic series: in order to follow the action and understand the characters, readers must read the three novels in order, starting with The Placebo Effect. It is written in \\"short, snappy chapters\\" sometimes less than a page in length. At the time Rotenberg had finished writing the draft of A Murder of Crows in early 2012, he described it as open-ended, anticipating that he would write as many as five or more novels in the series. As a \\"speculative thriller\\" series, the novels feature elements which may be understood as either supernatural or paranormal fiction, or science fiction, depending on the reader. In 2018, Richard Lanoie reviewed The Placebo Effect a \\"mystery\\" novel. In The Glass House, what Bill Selnes calls the \\"touch of the supernatural\\" in the first two novels \\"has taken over the story\\": the synaesthetes' exceptional talents are \\"supplemented\\" by \\"mystical abilities\\" such as telepathy. Reception =Critical response to The Placebo Effect= Richard Lanoie's review of The Placebo Effect is overwhelmingly positive: \\"Not only is Decker Roberts a very original and interesting character but the premise behind the character, the plot itself, and even the writing are fresh.\\" Stephen Patrick Clare said Rotenberg blended the best elements of his previous novels, with a \\"quirky cast of characters in an entertaining and engaging read that is distinctly Canadian\\", and dialogue that \\"is crisp, clear and concise, but never obvious or over-the-top\\". Clare is ambivalent about the series protagonist Derek Roberts: > Amidst the adventure, there is ample opportunity for Roberts' true persona > to emerge. Unfortunately, despite being privy to his peculiar private life, > the protagonist never feels fully fleshed out. That said, the book's weakest > link might also be its greatest strength; the author's glaring omission of > Roberts' inner life leaves a gaping hole that readers can fill in on their > own. As such, it is in the power of what is left unsaid ‚Äî the silent spaces > in between ‚Äî that the novel finds its... voice. Robert J. Wiersema called it a \\"somewhat workmanlike\\" thriller \\"possessed of an enthralling undercurrent that allows it to transcend its genre and shine on its own terms\\", and that Rotenberg \\"reveals a surprising depth and intricacy, not in the mechanics of his plot, but at the level of characterization.\\" Andrew Wilmot disagrees, finding characterization to be the single greatest problem in the novel, but far from the only one: Rotenberg \\"plays fast and loose with the concept of synaesthesia.\\" Wilmot also dislikes \\"film- and pop culture-based asides\\" which \\"add little if anything to the characters\\". =Critical response to A Murder of Crows= Valerie Senyk appreciated how Rotenberg built \\"suspenseful momentum\\" in telling the story: \\"It is a pleasure to read intelligent thrillers by Canadian writers. David Rotenberg ... is a man of many talents who brings his substantial experience in the theatre to his novels. Not only are they extremely literate and sophisticated, they boast truly inventive characters.\\" Bill Selnes found \\"the fascinating characters of the synaesthetes\\" were the strength of the novel, which \\"flows well\\", despite the plot being \\"disjointed at times\\", noting also that the title is \\"brilliantly related to the plot.\\" Rotenberg has created \\"a unique form of sleuth in Roberts.\\" Joseph Serge thought the \\"best parts\\" of A Murder of Crows were those related to the character of the janitor who blows up the graduating class of Ancaster College, comparing this aspect favourably to Thomas Harris' Silence of the Lambs: \\"Rotenberg gets us inside the mind of the psychopath. We find out about the people who've hurt him in the past and why he agrees to help the professor.\\" Serge finds that after the investigation with Roberts and Viola Tripping, however, the novel's pace slows \\"drastically\\": > Although the NSA was using the synaesthetes to track down the killer or > killers, there is never a sense of urgency, of racing against the clock. > There is no reason to believe the killer or killers will strike again... A > lot of fuss is made made about the U.S. president travelling to Ancaster > College to speak at the memorial service, but nothing really comes of it, > and we are left with an unsatisfying Edgar Allen Poe-style climax involving > a premature burial. Sarah Weinman finds the action fast-paced, \\"even a little too frenetic,\\" despite the introspection, \\"especially on the part of Decker's NSA handler Yslan Hicks\\", a conflict which \\"undercuts the believability\\" of the novel: \\"it's fun while reading, but the dots don't quite connect the way they are supposed to.\\" Andrew Wilmot criticizes the novel for the same flaws he found in The Placebo Effect, such as \\"frustratingly thin\\" characters, \\"a problem that stems in large part from the breakneck pace of each very short chapter\\". But the sequel has even more issues: political asides \\"that feel less tied to the characters and more as if they are a product of the author breaking the fourth wall to tell us how he feels about the world\\"; a \\"strange and out of place racial insensitivity on display when describing the almost magical connection most Africans seem to have to the planet, or the very free-flowing anti-Muslim language used in sections describing suspects in the attack.\\" As well, there is \\"insensitivity displayed towards women and size and sexual attraction.\\" =Critical response to The Glass House= Bill Selnes found The Glass House \\"interesting\\" but thought it demanded greater suspension of disbelief than the first two novels in the series: \\"The book became a form of fable requiring the reader to either suspend conventional assessments or accept the plot has become a modern myth.\\" While he also found the plot \\"disjointed\\", and the \\"connections between the plot lines awkward\\", he conceded that those who enjoy the paranormal (\\"an unconventional paranormal if that is possible\\") will be \\"fascinated\\" by the novel. Adaptations A series of CNIB audiobooks was produced in 2015, narrated by Maureen McAdams (The Placebo Effect), Pat Softly (A Murder of Crows), and Pat Davey (The Glass House).

Education and career Lindstedt grew up in Lund, where she studied at the Lund University. Concurrent with her post in China, Lindstedt served as Ambassador of Sweden to Mongolia. She also served as Ambassador of Sweden to Mexico (2006‚Äì2011) and Vietnam (2003‚Äì2006). Prior to joining the Foreign Service, she worked as a journalist and teacher.  Backdoor diplomacy controversy  In February 2019, Gui Minhai's daughter Angela made a blog post documenting a \\"very strange experience\\" involving Lindstedt. In it, she alleged that Lindstedt contacted her in mid-January and invited her to a meeting in Stockholm that she had set up with some Chinese businessmen who she thought could help secure her father's release. Angela recounted in her blog that the meetings were held at a private lounge in a Stockholm hotel, where she was sequestered for days, and was even escorted to and from the bathroom. The men, who claimed to have \\"connections within the Chinese Communist Party\\", apparently used a mixture of inducements, manipulation and threats on her. She was told that her father's release would be contingent on her stopping her campaign and avoiding media engagement. They offered her a Chinese visa as well as a job in the Chinese embassy. To Angela, Ambassador Lindstedt's presence and seemingly supportive stance suggested the talks were initiated by the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. She nevertheless felt uncomfortable with the meetings. When she later made inquiries of the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, it said it was unaware of the events. The Chinese Embassy in Stockholm denied any involvement; the Swedish Ministry said it was not aware of the events until after the meetings had taken place. It confirmed to the press that the ambassador had been recalled, and that an internal investigation into the incident was under way. Prosecutors investigated her ‚Äúfor breaching the country's national security by ‚Äòarbitrary conduct when negotiating with a foreign power.‚Äò‚Äú On 9 December, Lindstedt was charged by Swedish prosecutors for \\"arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power\\", an unprecedented charge in modern Sweden, with a possible maximum prison sentence of 2 years. Later on, her trial in Stockholm District Court started in June 2020. On 10 July the lower court ruled that the prosecutors could not prove Anna Lindstedt had exceeded her authority and acquitted her of the charges against her.

The 2011 census showed their population to be around 137,040. They are classified as a Scheduled Tribe by the Indian government. Etymology There are multiple legends regarding the origin of the tribe's name. According to one legend the name is derived from the words Bin and Jhal, meaning without sweat. The name Binjhal or Binjhwar is derived from the Vindhya Range hills (also known as Vindhyanchal) and they worship their patron deity Bindhyabasini'. History Historically the tribe has been known for fighting spirit. It is said that the tribe gave shelter to the mother of Chauhan Dynasty king Ramai Dev in 14th century. They also fought on the side of Veer Surendra Sai & Madho Singh (Ghess) during the Paika rebellion. Subdivisions The Binjhals are divided into a number of exogamous groups called Vansas, namely Amri, Nag, Khusal, Duguke, Kamati, Mahaiinga, Bagha, Marthi Endja, Bentakar, Majhi. These are further divided into patriarchal lineages such as Surya Bansi, Nag Bansi, Hillchip, Chauhan and Rajput.  Culture  Binjhal families are mostly nuclear. They follow Paternal lineage and Patrilocal traditions. Marriage with same exogamous vansa is prohibited. Monogamous marriages are common. Marriage by negotiation is the most common type of marriage. However cross-cousin marriage, junior levirate, junior sororate, marriage by elopement, by capture are also allowed. Divorce, remarriage of widows, widowers and divorcees are also permitted. The groom has to pay the bride price is cash. They practice burial in cases of deaths. However cremation is practised by the rich. They do not have any traditional village council.

It runs from √òsterbrogade in the southwest to √òstbanegade in the northeast. History Justinenborg The street is named after major-general and industrialist Johan Frederik Classen. whose summer retreat, Classens Have (\\"Classen's Garden\\") was located in the area. It had a vast garden as indicated by the name. Having no children, Classen endowed his estate to a foundation, Det Classenske Fideicommis. Classensgade originates in the access road to a property, Justineborg, which was named after Classen's sister- in_law. The street was officially named Classensvej (\\"Classen's Road#) in 1860. The short section from Lille Triangle to Kastelsvej was then part of Kastelsvej. In 1889, Classensvej and the first short section of Kastelsvej were renamed Classensgade. Notable buildings Np. 17-19: Classensgaard One of the only surviving country houses in √òsterbro, √òbrog√•rd or Vennero, is located in the courtyard of No. 11. It dates from the 19th century. Classensg√•rd (Np. 17-19), located opposite Kastelsvej, is a high-end apartment building. The facade surrounds a small cul-de-sac, a solution chosen to make the most of the site without employment of the traditional courtyard buildings. The building features two corner towers and a small bell tower as well as a clock gface at the bottom of the cul-de-sac. The building is from 1909. No. 44: H√∏kerforeningens Stiftelse H√∏kerforeningens Stiftelse (No. 44) is from 1862. Classens Have (No. 52-68) is a large Neoclassical apartment complex from 1922-24 designed by Povl Baumann, Peter Nielsen and Ole Falkentorp based on a project by Hans Koch og Carl Petersen. The perimeter block surrounds a large garden complex. The Neoclassical property at No. 59-65 was designed by Henning Hansen. No. 70, a building from 1931 designed by Thorkild Henningsen, is an example of the transition from Neoclassicism to Modernism. Public art, monuments and memorials Np. 38: Cow On a small mound in Classen's Garden stands a memorial to Johan Frederik Classen. The medallion with a portrait relief of Classen was designed by Johannes Wiedewelt. A marble plaque on No. 40 commemorates that the entertainer Victor Borge was born in the building. The plaque features a portrait of Borge as well as a quote by him, stating that the smile is the shortest distance between two people. Transport The nearest station is √òsterport, served both by metro, S-trains, regional and intercity trains. Movia bus line 37 runs through the street.

He currently works for the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotion where he portrays a face (known as a tecnico in lucha libre, the protagonists of professional wrestling). He is one of the competitors in CMLL's Micro-Estrella (\\"Micro-Star\\") division where he competes with and against other wrestlers with dwarfism. He started his professional wrestling career as a mascota companion for the regular-sized wrestler El Gallo, on who El Gallito's ring persona, masks and tights are patterned on. In 2017 he became an active wrestler in the Micro-Estrella division. He was originally known as El Gallito Tapatio, Spanish for \\"The Little Rooster from Guadalajara\\", later shortened to just \\"The Little Rooster\\". Professional wrestling career El Gallito (\\"The Little Rooster\\") started his professional wrestling career as a mascota for El Gallo (\\"The Rooster\\") in 2012. As a mascota, he portrayed a diminutive version of El Gallo and competed as the same rooster character as him.. The rooster imagery was supported by his mask, complete with a fake cockscomb on top of his head and fabric wattles dangling from his chin. As a mascota he would accompany El Gallo to the ring, the character was created primarily to appeal to children and assist El Gallo to portray a tecnico character (called a face, the protagonists in professional wrestling). = Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2017‚Äìpresent) = In early 2017 CMLL recruited El Gallito, and his fellow mascotas Mije and Zacar√≠as el Perico to help establish a Micro-Estrellas (\\"Micro-Stars\\") division, featuring only wrestlers with dwarfism. The first match of the Micro-Estrellas division took place on April 30, 2017, and saw El Gallito and Microman defeat Mije and Zacar√≠as in a special featured match. For the first anniversary of the Micro-Estrellas division, CMLL held an eight- micros torneo cibernetico elimination match, featuring the entire active Micro-Estrella division at the time. Gallito, Mije, Angelito, and Chamuel took on Microman, Atomo, Guapito, and Zacar√≠as, which saw Micropan pin Chamuel to win the tournament while Galliot was the fourth to be eliminated from the match. For the 2018 D√≠a de Muertos (\\"Day of the Dead\\") supercard show Gallito, Microman, and Atomo defeated Mije, Chamuel, and Zacar√≠as two falls to one. four weeks later the Micro-Estrellas also appeared at CMLL's Leyendas Mexicanas (\\"Mexican Legends\\") show where Gallito, Microman, and Guapito defeated Mije, Chamuel, and Zacar√≠as in the second match of the night. At the 2019 version of the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") show El Gallito and his team once again won their match. With the popularity of the Micro-Estrellas division, CMLL introduced the CMLL World Micro-Estrellas Championship in December 2019. El Gallito and five other Micro-Estrellas (Chamuel, Atomo, Microman, Guapito, and Zacar√≠as) were involved in the elimination match to determine the first champion on December 25. El Gallito was the second-to-last man eliminated from the match. In the end, Chamuel pinned Microman to eliminate him and win the championship. =Independent circuit (2017‚Äìpresent)= While working for CMLL, El Gallito, like all wrestlers employed by the company, is allowed to take independent circuit bookings on days he is not needed for their shows. El Gallito's independent circuit appearances usually sees him team with, and face off against, other CMLL Micro-Estrellas. His first non-CMLL match was on June 14, 2017, on a Promociones El Cholo show in Tijuana, Baja California, and saw El Gallito and Microman defeat Mije and Zacar√≠as by disqualification. On September 15, 2018, El Gallito and Microman defeated Chamuel and Zacar√≠as in a match at the Benito Juarez ExpoMuseo in Mexico City. The Micro-Estrellas also competed at Desastre Total Ultraviolento's 11th Anniversary Show, which saw Gallito and Microman defeating Mije and Zacar√≠as. They also made a special appearance for The Crash Lucha Libre, one of Mexico's largest independent promotions, with El Gallito and Microman once again defeating Chamuel and Zacar√≠as in their March 2, 2019 match.

He is the Eric L. and Lila D. Nelson Professor of Neuropharmacology at University of California, Irvine. He is also a Professor in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biology at University of California, Irvine. He is most known for his work in advancing understanding of neurotransmission and his impact on drug discovery. Civelli's research is focused on understanding brain function and the identification and study of novel molecules involved in brain activity. He was the first to decipher the structure of a dopamine receptor, the D2 receptor, central to neurobiology. He also uncovered the diversity of dopamine receptor family, identifying the D1 and D5 receptors and discovered the D4 receptor, of importance in psychiatry. Civelli then invented the strategy that uses orphan receptors to discover new neurotransmitters referred to as reverse pharmacology. Utilizing this strategy, he was the first to identify a novel neuropeptide, orphanin FQ (Nociceptin) in 1995, which he showed to regulate anxiety. He has written over 450 papers and holds 30 patents. In 2004, Nature Drug Discovery recognized him as one of the world's 20 leading experts on GPCR research and The Scientist featured him in Hooked on a Hunt in 2008. In 2015, he was awarded the Chinese Academy of Sciences President‚Äôs International Fellowship Initiative for Visiting Scientists.  Early life and education  Civelli was born in Fribourg, Switzerland. He received his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The research for his thesis was done at the Institut Jacques Monod in Paris under the supervision of Klaus Scherrer. He then worked as postdoctoral fellow on the discovery of opioid peptide precursors at the University of Oregon, Eugene, with Edward Herbert.  Career  In 1985, Civelli joined the Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, as a research assistant professor, and was a founding member of the Vollum Institute. It is there that he cloned the dopamine receptors and discovered their diversity. Civelli joined F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel in 1992 as vice president and developed the reverse pharmacology approach that allowed him to discover novel neuropeptides. He returned to academia as the Eric L. and Lila D. Nelson professor of neuropharmacology at the University of California, Irvine in 1996. From 2012 to 2019, he was the Chair of Department of Pharmacology at UC Irvine. = Research and work = Civelli's research is focused on understanding brain function and the identification and study of novel molecules involved in brain activity. He has conducted research in the area of molecular psychiatry, G protein-coupled receptors, neuropeptides, orphan receptors, novel neurotransmitters, dopamine receptors, orphanin FQ/nociceptin, MCH, and traditional Chinese medicines. In the mid-1980s, Civelli‚Äôs research pioneered the identification of new neurotransmitter receptors by applying the homology screening approach to G-protein coupled receptors, an approach which ultimately led to cloning of most of the G protein-coupled receptor families. This development led Civelli to be the first to characterize structurally a dopamine receptor, the D2 receptor. This discovery opened the search for additional dopamine receptors, and, in the subsequent years, Civelli discovered and described the unexpected diversity of dopamine receptors by successively cloning the D1, D4 and D5 receptors. His discovery of the D4 receptor suggested that this receptor may have a particular affinity for the atypical neuroleptic clozapine. Civelli's research in this period did not focus solely on dopamine receptors; he also discovered the adenosine A3 receptor. By cloning G protein-coupled receptors on the basis of their genomic sequences, Civelli had faced receptors that were not matched to their ligands, the so-called orphan receptors. He recognized that some orphan receptors will not match to known ligands and consequently that they will bind novel neurotransmitters or neuropeptides. So he devised a 'reverse pharmacology'. In 1995, he was first to discover a novel neuropeptide by using an orphan receptor as target. He named this novel neuropeptide orphanin FQ (OFQ, also known as nociceptin). It is similar in sequence to the opioid peptides. Civelli showed that OFQ does not act on opioid receptors and, in a series of pharmacological analyses, showed that the opioid and OFQ systems have diverged through evolution to prevent crosstalk. He furthermore showed that OFQ blocks stress-induced analgesia, and more importantly, that OFQ is anxiolytic, an activity that he assessed further by generating OFQ knock-out mice. Civelli has then pursued his search for novel transmitters by applying the strategy that he devised to additional orphan receptors. In doing so he was able to find that two particular orphan GPCRs were indeed receptors for melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and urotensin II. Then, he uncovered the physiological roles of another novel neuropeptide, NPS. More recently he has applied his approach to the discovery of active compounds in traditional medicines and has identified dihydrocorybulbine as a novel analgesic. The reverse pharmacological strategy that Civelli devised has since been used worldwide to discover several more peptides (in particular the orexins and ghrelin) and has had major impact on drug discovery.

Production =Background= For decades Arena M√©xico, the main venue of the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting Circo Atayde occupy the space over the holidays. As a result, CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". =Storylines= The 1982 Juicio Final show featured six professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform.

The characters that are introduced in this initial chapter later appear as the narrator or central protagonist in the following chapters. The second chapter follows the story of Dong-ho‚Äôs friend Jeong-dae, who died in the May uprising. The protagonist in the third chapter is Eun-sook, who worked with Dong-ho to collect the dead bodies after the Gwangju uprising. Eun-sook is living in the mid-1980s and works at a publishing agency. The fourth chapter traces the arc of Kim Jin-su, who was jailed for his involvement in the Gwangju uprising. He had spent time with Dong-ho and Jin-su and was the only boy who survived. Unable to bear his guilt, however, Jin-su takes his own life nearly ten years after the May 18 uprising. The narrator of the fifth chapter is Seon-ju, who suffered terrible sexual torture during the uprising and is working as an activist in the present day. The sixth chapter is a current-day soliloquy by Dong-ho‚Äôs mother, while in the epilogue, the author herself appears as the narrator. In this manner, Kang Dong-ho‚Äôs death and the confessions and testimonies of the people who remember him compose the framework of the novel.  Development and publication  Human Acts was serialized in the literary blog Window (Ï∞ΩÎ¨∏) run by Changbi, a Korean publishing house, from November 2013, to January 2014. Later, Human Acts was published in novel form, as the author‚Äôs sixth full-length novel. The novel is inspired by the Gwangju democratic movement that occurred on May 18, 1980, a major incident in Korea‚Äôs contemporary history. The author, Han Kang, has once remarked that her life was changed when her father showed her an album of photographs from the Gwangju uprising. Han conducted extensive research and reportage before writing a work of fiction based on such an unimaginably violent historical incident. At the time of her writing, the author has said there were times she couldn‚Äôt write more than three lines a day, due to the emotionally heavy toll of the incident. However, Han herself has said that Human Acts remains her most cherished work. The novel‚Äôs original title was You, In the Summer to shed light on the fact that spring has passed and summer has come, with the boy no longer alive to welcome the new season. The title was also intended to hint at how cruel summer can be. The ultimate title Human Acts was decided at the last minute. The young protagonist in the novel is merely referred to as ‚Äúyou‚Äù throughout the book, and the novel hauntingly makes it seem as if he is traveling across time from the 1980s to the present day. The boy is dead and can no longer be seen, but his presence can be felt each time the people who knew him calls for him.  Reception  Both the author and her critics have hailed Human Acts as her most representative work. Although the novel describes an incident familiar to most Korean readers, critics pointed out that the book was able to maintain its pace and tension until the end largely thanks to the power of Han‚Äôs writing. During the Park Geun-hye administration, Human Acts was excluded from inclusion into the Sejong Library project for reasons of ideological bias (books featuring keywords such as May 18, North Korea, Kaesong Industrial Complex, Karl Marx, etc. were largely excluded from the same list), and Han Kang was placed on the blacklist of professionals in the culture and the arts.  Style and themes  Human Acts was written in the author‚Äôs characteristically poetic, succinct style. Rather than discussing the heavy, somber ramifications of the Gwangju uprising or using titillating language, Han Kang chose to portray the grief of the individual people in a concise, boiled-down style. To appear authentic, the testimonies are offered individually across different chapters, by different narrators, in different styles, and in different forms. Together, these stories create a nuanced, dimensional look at the Gwangju uprising. To ensure the readers can appreciate the novel in a more deliberate, measured pace, some of the passages have been italicized to slow the readers down. The characters in Human Acts are average citizens. The novel illustrates how these people respond to the sudden tragedy that befell them. Rather than reenacting the historical incident, the author chose to place the perspectives squarely on the people who endured the horrific accident and the trauma they have had to carry since. Human Acts asks fundamental questions about the still-open wounds inflicted by state violence and human brutality. In the book, it is asked, ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to be human? What should we do, to make sure humans don‚Äôt become something?‚Äù This question is central to the novel and leads to the understanding that survivors must discuss the incident, record it, and remember it to make sure the unfortunate event, where the victims were their own neighbors, our friends, and our family members, will not repeat itself. The most fundamental way to make sure a painful historical event does not repeat itself is to remember what happened. The author herself has said she wants this novel not to expose or accuse, but rather to serve as a testimony and a gesture of mourning.  Adaptations  Human Acts was adapted for a theatrical production May 18 in Poland in October 2019. This was the first play produced in Europe that deals with the May 18 uprising. The May 18 Memorial Foundation provided material to inform the play. When the production was first staged in June for a limited four-time run, it was well received for having combined a Western production with Asian aesthetics. The book has been translated to over 14 languages.

She helped open a branch library for the community in Dallas, Texas. Early life Clanton was born on October 27, 1891 to parents Robert Allen Clanton and Susanna Elizabeth Webb in Dallas, Texas. Career In 1915, Clanton began her library career when she accepted a position with the Dallas Public Library. Over the years, she was appointed to branch librarian, assistant librarian, and eventually acting librarian before becoming head of the Dallas Public Library in 1927. After her promotion, she had to face the libraries financial crisis due to a lack of funding. In 1924, she revealed that there was an increase of over 5, 000 book loans from the Dallas Public Library, despite the increased popularity of radio. Although there was an increase, Clanton reported the library needed $25,000 worth of repairs. While she was head of the Dallas Public Library, Clanton was also elected President of the Texas Library Association. In 1929, Dallas had two libraries, Central and Oak Cliff. Clanton was one of the major advocates for branch libraries. She also created bookmobiles as a resource to reach more of the Dallas population. This was in part due to the drop in library book loans due to WW2. She also actively supported the creation of a library branch to serve Dallas' African-American community. In 1941, Clanton was selected for the Library Publicity Honor Roll. In the 1950s, she fought against the United States censorship of reading materials. She spoke in front of the City Council of Dallas to advocate for the allowance of pamphlet funding of material that the Council deemed \\"un-American.\\" When ordered to remove Communist material from the library, she refused on the basis that knowledge of Communism was not in itself harmful. In 1955, she retired and was succeeded by James Meeks. Although she was replaced, she kept her role as associate librarian with a salary of $500 a month. Before retiring, she helped lead the campaign for construction of a new library building in downtown Dallas.

On Synesthesia, the duo combines elements of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew-era fusion with a futuristic, technological sensibility that could only come out of Chicago. ... Synesthesia brings out the brilliance of Taylor and Mazurek's sparse instrumentation as, for the most part, they use only a cornet, a keyboard, and drums to weave their plaintive and complex compositions. Mazurek's trumpeting skill is impeccable and his experimentation with Synesthesia's rhythm structures is mindblowing as he switches from totally free jazz, to hard bop, to acid jazz at the drop of a hat. Certainly, the lack of other instruments in the mix makes for a grand space to showcase both Mazurek's and Taylor's talents. With Synesthesia, the Chicago Underground Duo provides a strong link between experimental avant-garde jazz and jazz-flecked electronic music. A very provocative and beautiful record\\". Pitchfork's Mat LeMay called it \\"a thoroughly enjoyable record, at times reaching even beyond that\\" but noted \\"Unfortunately, Mazurek's electronic wizardry doesn't always couple well with Taylor's more traditional free jazz stylings\\" conceding that \\"The more adventurous passages obviously spring from the able mind of Mazurek, whereas Taylor's portion consists of extended forays into free jazz, complete with wanky drum solos ... For a record with such startling and emphatic dynamics changes, the better portions of Synesthesia are remarkably smooth ... Mazurek seems to be chipping away at band members and, in doing so, bringing his own unique brand of genre-twisting, rock-influenced electronic jazz into focus. With Synesthesia, Mazurek proves once and for all that he's more than just an ace horn player\\".LeMay, M. Pitchfork Review, accessed October 29 On All About Jazz Derek John stated \\"A magnificent example of what happens when open-minded musicians realize the full potential of jazz in the present tense, Synesthesia, contrary to the word's connotations, could, in fact, be the reawakening of the rebirth of cool\\".Joh, D. All About Jazz Review, accessed October 29 In JazzTimes Christopher Porter noted \\"While the CD features some unique soundscapes, and its appeal increases immensely with repeated listens, it‚Äôs one of the lesser titles in the group‚Äôs ever-expanding catalog ... Synesthesia‚Äôs vibe is more of a studio-composed experiment that relies on overdubs and the layering of Taylor‚Äôs vibraphones and Mazurek‚Äôs electronically manipulated cornet and keyboard squiggles to make its bed of sound, which often recalls Miles Davis during the abstract-ambient parts of Get Up with It\\".Porter, C.

On 25 November 2019, the Bulgarian broadcaster Bulgarian National Television (BNT) announced that Victoria had been internally selected to compete at the 2020 contest in Rotterdam, Netherlands. However, due to 2019-20 pandemic of Coronavirus, the contest was cancelled. Background Prior to the 2020 contest, Bulgaria had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twelve times since its first entry in . The nation achieved their best result in the contest in 2017 with the song \\"Beautiful Mess\\" performed by Kristian Kostov, which placed second. To this point, four Bulgarian entry have qualified to the Eurovision final; the nation had failed to qualify to the final with their other eight entries. The Bulgarian national broadcaster, Bulgarian National Television (BNT), broadcasts the event within Bulgaria and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. In the past, BNT had alternated between both internal selections and national finals in order to select the Bulgarian entry. After consistently being present for every contest since their debut in 2005, the Bulgarian broadcaster announced in November 2013 that the country would not participate in the citing an expensive participation fee and limited funds due to budget cuts as reasons for their decision. Limited finances also prevented the broadcaster from returning in . After a two-year absence, BNT confirmed Bulgaria's return at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016.

He led the development of the \\"82 Project\\", China's first fiber-optic communication system that was approved for practical use. He won the National Science Congress Award in 1978 and the State Science and Technology Progress Award (Second Class) in 1985.  Early life and education  Yang was born on 20 October 1919 in Raoping County, Guangdong, Republic of China. He was admitted to Wuhan University in 1937, shortly before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Before Wuhan fell to the invading Japanese Army, the university evacuated to Leshan in Sichuan province, where Yang and his fellow students studied in between Japanese bombing raids. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in telecommunications in 1941 and 1943, respectively.  Career  After graduation, Yang taught at Wuhan University, Sun Yat-sen University, Nankai University, Tianjin University, and Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications.

The system, spanning , would link the districts of Wuchang and Hankou of Wuhan, which are separated by the Yangtze river. Fiber-optic communication was a new technology at the time and there had been no prior research in the field in China. Yang and his colleagues overcame many technical difficulties, including the loss of signals and limitation in the length of the optical fibre. The system was approved by the Chinese government for practical use in 1982, the first in the country. The project laid the foundation for the rapid development of the fiber-optic industry in China, and fiber-optic communication systems were subsequently built in many other cities. The project won the State Science and Technology Progress Award (Second Class) in 1985, as well as provincial and ministerial awards. Yang returned to Tianjin University in 1985 to serve as President of the Institute of Fiber-Optic Technology, where he built the first fiber-optic laboratory in the city of Tianjin. He retired from the position in 1988, but kept teaching at the university until the age of 99 (100 in East Asian age reckoning). In 2005, Yang donated 300,000 yuan to construct a science building at the central primary school of his hometown Raoping County. Over his remaining years, he also donated about 500,000 yuan to help needy students in Raoping.  Personal life  Yang played tennis until he was 93 and taught till the last year of his life.

Biography He was born at Carpentras about 1578, and died at Paris in 1650. Son of a Jewish second-hand dealer, his original name was Mordekha√Ø Crescas (or Mardoch√©e Cresque) and early in life he left his native town to study medicine for a few years without ever obtaining a degree. He was excommunicated from his religious community for having disregarded the obligation on Saturday and for this reason went to Aquino, where he became converted to Catholic Church and changed his name to Philippe d'Aquin. In 1610 he went to Paris, and was appointed by Louis XIII professor of the Hebrew and Aramaic language at the Royal College. He also worked as a doctor with Marie de Medici and Concino Concini and was mentioned among the accusers in the proceedings for \\"the crime of Judaism\\".

He became famous at the turn of the twentieth century for his efforts in designing structures in eclectic and Art Nouveau styles. Life and career Born to Francesco Locati and Angela Fossati, he studied at the Accademia di Brera, where he was a pupil of Camillo Boito and Carlo Formenti. After completing his studies in 1881, he won the Oggioni Competition for a two-year post-graduate course in Rome, after which he moved to Paris, where he enrolled in the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and where he updated his artistic knowledge, nurturing his eclectic taste. His career began in 1885 when he collaborated as an assistant with Luca Beltrami and Giovanni Ceruti in designing the Sartorelli house on the via Torino in Milan. [2] There, Locati built several eclectic buildings for private clients, including the Casa Rigamonti at 24 via Solferino (1889‚Äì90), the Casa dei fratelli Reining (later demolished) on the Corso Genova at the corner of the Piazzale Cantore (1895‚Äì96), and the house of the sculptor Odoardo Tabacchi (1902). [3] In 1899 he obtained an appointment as a professor at the University of Pavia, where he taught decoration and architecture, architectural composition and practical architecture until 1935. He also held the post of commissioner of the Conservative Commission of Monuments for Lombardy under the direction of the architect Gaetano Moretti. Locati reached the peak of his professional career in 1906, when he was in charge of the general artistic direction of the section set up at the Parco Sempione of the great Milan International Exhibition, dedicated to the opening of the new Simplon railway tunnel. For the fair he designed the main entrance with an elliptical configuration with the reproduction of the two entrances to the tunnel, some pavilions, the entrance and pavilion of the National Exhibition of Fine Arts and the Aquarium building, in which the references to the Vienna Secession are clearly evident. He is buried at the Monumental Cemetery in Milan. Bibliography * G.L. Ciag√†, ed., Archivi di architettura in Lombardia.

Gustave Courbet and √âdouard Manet are the two main suspects. = Act I = In Paris 1865, in a police station, a vast rectangular room, Inspector Denis is leaning against a long counter. A second police officer is sitting in front of a desk. They're talking. Behind the counter, we see people who are constantly being marginalized and mistreated by the police. Inspector Denis describes the lifeless body of a young girl who has just been murdered. His identity is unknown. Inspector Denis decided to investigate in a place where the young girl was dating: the Caf√© Vingt-et-Un. In this caf√©, the customers are demi-mondaines, left-winged and strolling people with questionable morals. Inspector Denis shows Victorine Meurend a picture of the body, which, horrified, identifies her friend Virginie. Victorine denounces the Inspector's contempt for the demi-mondaines women of which she is a member: : At the police station, Sergeant Nozi√®re and Inspector Denis linked this murder to a series of murders of young women. They speculate in order to find the motive for the crimes and the culprit. They allude to several works of art: Gustave Courbet's Les Demoiselles des Bords de la Seine and Manet's Olympia. They decide to question their informer, Picas Osebracs. = Act II = La Toilette de V√©nus, de Fran√ßois Boucher. At the police station, Inspector Denis, Sergeant Nozi√®re and a second police officer observe various images. They're still looking for the motive for the crime. The second police officer takes a photograph and shows it to Inspector Denis as if he was showing a drawing to a connoisseur. Allusion to Fran√ßois Boucher's La Toilette de V√©nus. Conversation between Picas Osebracs, Inspector Denis and Sergeant Nozi√®re. Picas Osebracs reveals to Inspector Denis that the murdered girl was not a prostitute but a model who posed for painters. A certain Jean Fils sends a ticket to Inspector Denis because he wants to meet him at 11 a.m. at the Caf√© Vingt-et-Un. Inspector Denis decides to go there incognito. Jean Fils introduced himself with a girl. Jean Fils insinuates to Inspector Denis that Courbet is the guilty party. : At the police station, at dawn, Inspector Denis asked his collaborators if they had found any clues about Courbet. In a file he discovers a writing from him: \\"Work it out who can!\\", an allusion to a letter from Courbet to his friend Louis Fran√ßais in 1855 in which he refers to the painter's studio. : Inspector Denis decides to go to Courbet's workshop. = Act III = In a dark street in Paris, Inspector Denis and Sergeant Nozi√®re are hidden in order to watch the entrance to Gustave Courbet's workshop. Sergeant Nozi√®re evokes the notoriety of Courbet's work. Inspector Denis believes that these are political crimes executed by the Republicans. A man and a peasant holding a scythe enter. They mumble an unintelligible foreign language. Inspector Denis visits Courbet's workshop,. which he entered without knocking. He decides to pretend to be the fire chief: Inspector R. Janvin Rambrent. This is an allusion to the painting Firemen running at the fire by Courbet. Begins a conversation between the painter and Inspector Denis. Courbet declares: : Inspector Denis shows him a search warrant. He wants to search his workshop. Courbet unmasked Inspector Denis and discovered that he was a police officer. The Inspector asked him what his alibi was for the night of June 2, 1858. Courbet replied that he was hunting in Frankfurt. He then asked him for his alibi for February 10, 1849. Courbet states that he was then in Amsterdam. Finally, Inspector Denis asked him for his alibi for March 10 ten years earlier. Courbet replied that he was in Ornans where he was realising a painting from his studio. : Inspector Denis returns to the police station. A police report mentions Manet's name. In Manet's studio, he and his friend Mr Barbin contemplate Olympia. Inspector Denis broke into the studio and listened to them in secret. Inspector Denis then asked Manet to provide an alibi. Manet says he was painting. Victorine Meurend has to join him to pose in his studio. Courbet shows Inspector Denis the painting in his workshop. We see a woman lying there, Olympia. Confused, the Inspector sees in Olympia's painting a projection of the murder that Manet intends to commit. For him, Victorine is in danger of death. Jean Fils arrives in Manet's studio. He describes Victorine as an embodiment of modernity: : Finally, Inspector Denis excludes Manet as a suspect. = Act IV = Victorine Meurend talks with her friend Marianne Bricaf√®re in her apartment at 17 rue Ma√Ætre-Albert. They talk about their friend Virginie's sad fate. The janitor enters and tells Victorine that the police are looking for her because she would be in danger of death. The act ends with an aria \\"What can I say to these crazy police?\\" in which Victorine concludes by saying that the crime is that of jouissance. :  Musical score  Victorine's musical score is written by Mayo Thompson, leader of the American experimental rock group Red Krayola. who has been collaborating regularly with Art & Language since the 1970s. It remains unfinished to this day.  Opera performances  Initially, Victorine was to be performed in the city of Cassel, Germany for documenta 7 in 1982 and shown alongside Art & Language Studio at 3 Wesley Place; Painted by Actors. The performance was to be filmed by a German television channel,. but the project was not successful. A unique performance of Victorine's Act IV was given in 2012, during the biennale of the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Felix Bernstein performed Victorine and Gabe Rubin, his friend Marianne Bricaf√®re. A capture of this representation is shown at the Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau - Museum of Contemporary Art in the hanging of the museum's permanent collection.

She is currently an associate professor at the University of Bristol. Aplin has made significant contributions to interdisciplinary aspects of space and terrestrial science, in particular the importance of electrical effects on planetary atmospheres.  Education and research career  After attending The High School, Gloucester, Aplin completed a BSc in Natural Sciences at Durham University in 1997. She was president of Durham University Orchestral Society and received the Norah C. Bowes bequest for the arts. She completed her PhD in experimental atmospheric physics in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading in 2000. She took up research posts at the University of Hertfordshire and the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, working on aspects of space and atmospheric instrumentation, before becoming head of the physics laboratories at Oxford University in 2009. In 2018 she moved to the University of Bristol.  Work on atmospheric electricity  Aplin's research has focussed on innovative instrumentation as applied to problems in space and atmospheric science, in particular electrical effects and measurements. She currently maintains the Snowdon space-weather observatory. She has performed experimental work on the atmospheric effects of ions formed by cosmic rays, but has been keen to stress that the formed \\"particles are too small to act as cloud condensation nuclei\\", and thus there is unlikely to be a strong cosmic- ray link to global cloud cover. Her work on atmospheric electricity also extends to the link between volcanoes, lightning and radon gas, and to other solar system bodies, in particular the ultraviolet and galactic cosmic ray effects on Neptune's atmosphere. In a similarly interdisciplinary spirit, Aplin has researched the influence of the climate and weather on western orchestral composers.

Upon delivery, she will become the company's fifth Royal-class ship in the fleet. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, her completion and debut dates are pending further determination.  History  = Construction = Carnival Corporation first entered a strategic agreement with Fincantieri in March 2015 for five cruise ships for delivery between 2019 and 2022. From this agreement, the contract for a then-unnamed, fifth Royal-class vessel was finalized for Princess on 2 April 2016. She will measure 145,000 GT and have a capacity of 3,660 passengers. On 20 August 2018, Princess Cruises announced that the name of their fifth Royal-class ship would be Enchanted Princess, and is scheduled to debut on 15 June 2020. Enchanted Princess is under construction at Fincantieri's shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. The keel was laid at the shipyard on 14 February 2019. The ship was first floated out from the shipyard on 6 August 2019, with a dedication performed by Marinella Cossu, a Fincantieri employee. Princess Cruises celebrated a formal float-out in a ceremony in Monfalcone on 17 September 2019 with Doris Magsaysay Ho, a Princess crew recruiter and trainer in the Philippines, performing the honors. In April 2020, Princess announced that the ship would experience delays in construction progress due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the national lockdown in Italy, which together resulted in the temporary closure of Fincantieri's shipyards. Work eventually resumed and sea trials began on 13 June 2020, when the ship sailed from Monfalcone to Palermo. The ship remained in Palermo until 26 June before returning to Monfalcone on 29 June. On 8 July 2020, Princess announced the ship's sea trials had been successfully completed. Her delivery was delayed ant the ship was finally delivered on 30 September 2020.

The ship was initially scheduled for a public debut in Rome on 19 June 2020 on a Mediterranean sailing. Her christening was set for 30 June 2020 in Southampton. Her 10-day maiden voyage was scheduled for 1 July 2020 from Southampton to Rome, calling in Bilbao, Lisbon, Gibraltar, Barcelona, Toulon, and Florence. The ship's christening and inaugural festivities have subsequently been postponed, with the date of her debut pending further determination. = Operational career = The ship's inaugural season has also been impacted by the delays. After her maiden voyage, she was scheduled to sail Mediterranean itineraries through summer 2020. She was scheduled to re-position to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida via a transatlantic crossing in the fall. The delays, compounded by Princess' suspension of operations, resulted in the cancellation of these sailings. Enchanted Princess is scheduled to commence operations in November 2020 from Port Everglades. For her inaugural Caribbean season, she will sail seven-day, round-trip Eastern and Western Caribbean itineraries between November 2020 and April 2021. The ship is scheduled to sail Mediterranean itineraries in summer 2021.

Its passenger cabin seated six. Only one was completed, and that was eventually scuttled to keep it out of Allied hands. Another of the military prototypes was intended to have a bigger, nine seat cabin and other refinements but the Gs.II was incomplete when discovered by Allied inspectors. Design and development The Gs.I was originally designed as a reconnaissance flying boat for the German Navy. Construction began in August 1918 but it was unfinished by the time of the November Armistice, after which militarary aircraft building was forbidden. Zeppelin-Lindau responded by completing one of the three examples ordered into a small airliner. Like the earlier Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.II and its successors, the all-metal Gs.I was a high wing, strut-braced monoplane but its engines were on top of the wing rather than between it and the hull. The wing had twin, triangular section spars, aluminium ribs and was fabric-covered. It was rectangular in plan apart from slightly blunted tips, with a low aspect ratio of 5.6. On each side a parallel pair of steel tube struts braced the outer wings to the sponsons, which provided stability on water. The centre-section struttage was complicated by the need to support and absorb the engine weight and thrust. The Gs.I was powered by a pair of water-cooled, six cylinder inline, Maybach Mb IVa engines in push-pull configuration within a single cowling on top of the wing. The forward engine had a frontal radiator but the rear one had a smaller radiator above the cowling and its upper parts exposed for cooling. Their tanks held of fuel. The flying boat's duralumin hull was wide and its shallow planing bottom had its main step under mid-wing, narrowing aft to a secondary step. The original military design accommodated three, a nose gunner, the pilot in a cockpit ahead of the wing and a dorsal gunner between wing and tail. Instead, the airliner had a small, enclosed, rounded passenger cabin built upon the deck ahead of the wing. The pilot sat in an open cockpit above the front of the cabin, which held six (or eight) passengers and had four generous windows on each side. The position of the flight engineer is uncertain: L'A√©rophile describes a post under the wing whilst images show a position behind the pilot as well as an unenclosed dorsal post. The Gs.I had a twin finned, strutted biplane tail. The lower, rectangular plan tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage with rectangular fins at its tips supporting a wider span upper tailplane with slightly angled tips. The elevators were also rectangular but the rudders were cut away at the top for elevator movement. Operational history The Gs.I made its first flight on 21 July 1919. After a period of flight-testing it was trialed by the Swiss airliner ad Astra, a forerunner of Swissair. After a series of flights it was returned to Lindau on 10 December 1919. It then gave a demonstration flight on 3 March 1920 in the Netherlands, where KLM had shown an interest. On their way to another demonstration, this time in Stockholm, the crew learned that the aircraft was to be searched by the commission who supervised German aircraft construction at the time. Rather than risking the Gs.I's confiscation and the revelation of its advanced construction features they diverted to Kiel and, on 25 April 1920, scuttled it in the Baltic. Zeppelin-Lindau Gs.II thumb The Gs.II was a planned larger and more refined version of the Gs.I, using the two remaining military Gs.I airframes. The layout and engines remained the same but wing area was increased by 22% by a 7% increase in span and 6% decrease in aspect ratio. The new wing was metal-skinned, with readily removed panels for internal inspection, though fabric-covering was an option, yielding an extra of payload. Dornier Gs.II cabin The other major changes were to the passenger and crew accommodation and to the tail. The bulbous cabin of the Gs.I was removed and a new, longer cabin built under the original deckline, stretching back to the plane of the forward propeller. It could hold eight, or nine \\"at a pinch\\". To the rear of the cabin there was a luggage hold and, behind that, the fuel tanks. The pilot and mechanic also sat to the rear of the cabin, raised to deck level and behind the propeller, in an open, side-by-side seat cockpit. The Gs.I's biplane, twin-finned tail was replaced by a more conventional, cruciform unit with angular surfaces. A small fin with a cropped triangular profile carried a balanced rudder and also mounted a rectangular plan tailplane, double strut-mounted just above the fuselage. This carried rectangular, narrow chord elevators. The partial construction of at least one Gs.II is known from photographs to have started and its new forward fuselage mostly built but it was probably destroyed by the Allies in 1919 before completion.

The building was built by Leslie 'Snow' Kenna in 1942 and closed, as a theatre, in 1984 and now operates as the Alice Springs YHA.  History  Leslie Kenna, known almost universally as Snow, arrived in Alice Springs in the latter half of 1936 with motion picture equipment and ‚Äúa tonne of nitrate picture film‚Äù. Kenna very soon started showing movies at the Welfare Hall before the Capitol Theatre was opened by his friend, and landlord Ly Underdown who Kenna leased it from. Movies were a very important part of the social life of people in Alice Springs at this time; especially because. from 1928 - 1964 Aboriginal people were only allowed into the \\"town-limits\\" during daylight hours for medical attention, and only to attend \\"the pictures\\" in the evenings. In 1942 Kenna built his own theatre, Pioneer Theatre, on Parsons Street, which had no roof as there was no air-conditioning in town and this, in combination with the deck chairs provided, kept keep people cool. In winter, when minus temperatures are reached, people brought blankets, hot water bottles and flasks of coffee. Frequently dogs, from the outlying town- camps, wandered into the Theatre with their Aboriginal owners and provided an entertainment of their own. Important events in the Theatres operation were: * 1955; The Alice Springs premiere of the film Jedda, an Australian classic which starred local girl Rose Kgarla Kunoth (now known as Rosalie Kunoth- Monks) and much of the film was shot in Central Australia. * 1956; The 'bush' premiere of A Town Like Alice which was partially filmed in Alice Springs. This was apparently a very relaxed occasion and, during the intermission, Arrernte men from Hermannsburg, sung in the Arrernte language; it was said that \\"Hollywood would have been horrified\\". In attendance were: Peter Finch (who brought the air hostess from his flight to Alice Springs, Beryl Oliver, as his date), Nevil Shute, Jock Nelson and Gough Whitlam. This event raised almost ¬£1000; all of which Kenna gave to the Royal Flying Doctors Service. Kenna died in August 1965 and the Kenna family continued to run the theatre, and the Pioneer Drive-In Picture Theatre (which Kenna had established in 1957) until the early 1970s when they sold them the Greater Union Theatres. Greater Union Theatres only opened the Pioneer Theatre on Saturday nights and, for many years, new releases would be shown first here before opening at the drive-in. Following a decline in demand, the Theatre was closed in early 1984 and, on the 8th of December 1984, Major Leslie Oldfield opened \\"Pioneer Market Place\\", a grocery, and one of the two dozen shops opened on the property. This was, however, short lived, and in 1986 the Theatre was threatened with demolition but, following intervention from the National Trust of Australia (Northern Territory), and the YHA's interest in buying the property in 1988 it was saved. It is one of the few surviving World War II era buildings remaining in Alice Springs and it is believed to be the last known example of its kind in the Northern Territory. The former theatre was nominated in 1994 for inclusion on the Northern Territory Heritage Register, but the nomination lapsed in 2013 after the owner declined to agree to have the building listed.

He discovered his passion for the area's avant-garde culture in early 1970. Before becoming known as an artist, Mundo Meza worked for shoe designer Fred Slatten on Santa Monica Boulevard as a window dresser. He also painted unique designs onto Slatten's platform shoes, gathering a celebrity clientele which included Cher, Elton John, and Diana Ross. He played a pivotal role in the emergence of Chicano conceptualists which included Robert Legorreta (Cyclona), Joey Terrill, Teddy Sandoval, Jack Vargas and members of the collective Asco led by Harry Gamboa, Jr., Gronk, Willie Herr√≥n, and Patssi Valdez. His work was highly influenced by the Chicano artistic community which has recently started to receive public recognition due to its panache, confrontational aesthetics, and extravagance. He died in 1985 due to complications from AIDS.  Education  He graduated from Huntington Park High in 1973 with a scholarship to Otis Art Institute.{8}June 1973}}  Career  Mundo Meza had a multidisciplinary practice that encompassed an array of different fields including painting, design, fashion, and installation. Initially, all of his work responded directly to the issues of society, and by his use of mesoamerican imagery, Meza was able to contextualize within the gay liberation movement. Meza is widely known for his collaborations with Robert Legorreta (Cyclona) and Gronk during the early 1970s. His work included a number of confrontational performances in East Los Angeles, including, Caca-Roaches Have No Friends. His early practice combined Chicano Nationalism with visual panache and psychedelic experimentation in order to enunciate the ideology behind his work. From 1975 to 1978, Mundo danced with the Aisha Dance Company. He performed, along with others, for the opening of the King Tut exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in March 1978. Mundo also mastered the difficult, meditative \\"Turkish Whirling Dervish\\" dance. In the early 80s, Mundo collaborated with British creative director Simon Doonan, producing window displays for Maxfield Bleu in West Hollywood and other Melrose Avenue boutiques. Parody and satire were a common theme which set them apart from other displays. By 1983, his work became increasingly lyrical and abstract. Most of his paintings depicted the Chicano Body as a site for subversion and were calm simplified compositions. This change in tone was his method of using modernist abstraction in order to shed light on a new dialectic figure of queerness in the face of AIDS.  Legacy  In 2014 and 2015, the Getty Foundation awarded grants totaling $270,000 for exhibition research, support, and implementation of Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A. Organized by the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the University of Southern California Libraries, the exhibition takes its name from Meza's work and focuses on queer, Chicanx artists and their collaborations from the late 1960s to the early 1990s.

History The federation was established in 1952, on the initiative of British Actors' Equity Association, and the Syndicat Fran√ßais des Artistes-Intepr√®tes. The organisation's logo was designed by Jean Cocteau. In 1970, the International Federation of Variety Artists joined the organisation. For many years, the secretariat was independent of both the main international federations of trade unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions, and as such, by the 1980s, it represented both unions in capitalist countries, and in communist countries. In 1997, the organisation affiliated to the International Arts and Entertainment Alliance.Verity Burgmann, Globalization and Labour in the Twenty-First Century, pp.122-123 Leadership =General Secretaries= :1952: Pierre Chesnais :1968: Rolf Rembe :1974: Gerald Croasdell :1983: Rolf Rembe :1991: Michael Crosby :1996: Katherine Sand :2001: Dominick Luquer =Presidents= :1952: Jean Darcante :1956: Gordon Sandison :1958: Fernand Gravey :1964: Rodolfo Landa :1967: Vlastimil Fisar :1970: Pierre Boucher :1973: France Delahalle :1982: Peter Heinz Kersten :1992: Tomas Bolme :2008: Agnete Haaland :2012: Ferne Downey References Category:Trade unions established in 1952 Category:Global union federations Category:Actors' trade unions ","title":"International Federation of Actors"},{"id":"62198979","text":"David Rin√ßon (born 8 March 1970) is a French former football forward.

In international rallying, R5 refers to a class of cars competing under Group R regulations. R5 regulations were introduced by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in 2012 as a replacement for the Super 2000 class. R5 cars are based on production cars and feature a 1600cc turbocharged petrol engine. R5 cars are a step down from World Rally Cars in their power and performance. They are eligible to compete in the World Rally Championship and in a dedicated series known as the World Rally Championship-2. This championship is exclusively open to manufacturer and professional independent teams competing in R5 cars. In 2020, privateer entries in R5 cars will contest the World Rally Championship-3. R5 cars also compete in regional championships such as the European Rally Championship and national-level events such as the British Rally Championship. List of R5 models A Volkswagen Polo GTI R5 at the 2019 Rally Bohemia. The following models are eligible to compete in the World Rally Championship and its support categories: * Citro√´n C3 R5 * Citro√´n DS3 R5 * Ford Fiesta R5 and Fiesta R5 Mk.
