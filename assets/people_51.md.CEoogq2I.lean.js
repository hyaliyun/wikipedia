The mix is balanced and breathes with the music. A key element of each tune is the razor precision playing of Aaron Akin and Trevor Johanson.

The gameplay has been compared to a cross between Super Meat Boy and Flappy Bird. Its developers were inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and the 90s cartoon SWAT Kats. The game was released in September 24, 2014 on Microsoft Windows and it will be released in 2017 on OS X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox One platforms.  Gameplay  The player-character, Fenix, pursues an evil creature after it freezes and destroys his town. Fenix can jump infinitely as well as dash. There are 200 levels, and the game has no tutorial. The player jumps around each level to reach a blue door. Each level has an optional cookie hidden in a difficult to access area. Players who collect them receive out-of-game recipes for new cookies. Players must restart the entire level upon dying, though respawns are fast.  Development  Fenix Rage was made by Green Lava Studios, a three-person team from Costa Rica: CEO and programmer Eduardo Ramirez, Diego Vasquez, and Jose Mora. The gameplay is inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and its art direction is influenced by 90s cartoon SWAT Kats and the Hellboy comics by Mike Mignola. Ramirez has said that they want players \\"to recapture the feeling of discovery\\". They debuted a \\"simple\\" prototype of the game on Google Play \\"a couple of years\\" before its late May 2014 announcement for the PlayStation 4. The game made its first public demo at PAX East 2014, where the team received positive feedback about the controls. Fenix Rage was released in September 24, 2014 on Microsoft Windows and it will be released in 2016 on OS X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox One.  Reception  Video game journalists compared the game to a cross between Super Meat Boy and Flappy Bird. IGN wrote that dying often was what made the game fun. Hardcore Gamer said the game is \\"a worthy entry into an unfortunately short line of hardcore and enjoyable platformers, with great aesthetics and music backed by solid mechanics.\\"  References  Category:2014 video games Category:Video games developed in Costa Rica Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Xbox One games Category:Platform games Category:Indie video games ","title":"Fenix Rage"},{"id":"43011768","text":"White Night is a 2015 survival horror puzzle video game developed by French indie studio OSome Studio, and published by Activision. On 3 March 2015, it was released on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was later released on Xbox One on 6 March 2015.  Development  White Night started in 2010, when its lead developer was working on a remake of Alone in the Dark. During this time, he became interested with the idea of putting black and white into a survival horror game. The team built the engine from scratch and found it gratifying to see it play out on various consoles. They enjoyed working with Activision, and appreciated the resources that partnership came with, for instance them showing the game off to the media. They had free rein in their creative decision, and while Activision offered tips on where to improve; money was no issue.  Design and gameplay  The game has a monochromatic graphical style. Its slow jazz piano soundscape is reminiscent of classic noir thrillers. The narrative is told to the player via \\"voice-over, on-screen text, and journal entries\\".  Plot  The game takes place within Vesper Mansion, where the player aims to solve a mystery. After having a car crash, the 30-something- year-old protagonist finds himself stumbling into what appears at first glance to be an abandoned mansion.  Reception  IGN praised the title's atmospheric and eerie atmosphere, though felt the aesthetic design compromised the title's exploration and puzzle-solving. Destructoid felt that the game falsely advertises itself as a \\"traditional survival experience of limited resources against considerable odds\\", whereas it just takes some gameplay elements of survival titles while centering on exploration mechanics. GameSpot made comparisons to Resident Evil due to its fixed camera angles.

It was released for Windows, Mac and Linux on September 18, 2014, for Xbox One on February 20, 2015, and for PlayStation 4 on May 26, 2015. A PlayStation Vita port was released on June 26, 2018, as a cross-buy title with the PlayStation 4 version. The game involves a constantly-rotating limousine which the player has to drive around an open world while completing miscellaneous objectives such as pick up and dropping people off or finding collectible items. The gameplay has been described as inspired by Kuru Kuru Kururin (where you also control a constantly-rotating vehicle), and Crazy Taxi (where the goal of the game is to drive NPCs from one location to another). Gameplay Plot In 1977, Georgio Manos becomes the world's first revolving limousine driver, taxiing the citizens of the city of Roundabout to various destinations. A frequent passenger named Elizabeth earns Georgio's deep admiration, and a romance begins to develop between the two. Georgio also develops a rivalry with Ronaldo, another limousine driver who steals Georgio's technique and overtakes them as the #1 revolving limousine driver in the city. Desperate to defeat Ronaldo, Georgio acquires some candy dots with the help of Mickey the mechanic, which causes Georgio to hallucinate and see Jeffrey the Skeleton. Guided by Jeffrey in a candy-dot-fueled frenzy, Georgio goes on a murderous rampage through the city. Spurred on by Elizabeth, Georgio then challenges Ronaldo to a race, during which they run Ronaldo off the road, destroying his car and killing him. Six months later, Georgio has retreated to the northern mountains out of shame, as destroying someone else's car is akin to treason in Roundabout. Having lost Elizabeth and running low on candy dots, Jeffrey urges Georgio to get their act back together and win back Elizabeth's heart. At the same time, Georgio is hounded by Ge-Op (Georgio Operations), a police squad tasked with hunting them down. In the end, Georgio and Elizabeth are reunited, and Elizabeth explains that she is tired of Georgio's constant spinning, pleading with Georgio to drive straight for even a little while. After Georgio awkwardly attempts to drive straight, Elizabeth decides that she should not force Georgio to be someone they are not, and the two drive off into the sunset together. Reception The game received positive reviews upon release. The versions for each console received different scores despite being identical to each other.

The company supplies a wide range of pharmaceuticals and home healthcare with around 1,000 employees dealing with more than 150,000 patients a year. In Spring 2015, Healthcare at Home reverted to using in house logistics rather than working with a third party for all deliveries. In Autumn 2015, the company went through a full corporate rebranding, including new logos, literature, strap line and website in an attempt to re-establish the company's status in the market.  Previous Issues  In 2013 Healthcare at Home took over almost 3,000 patients from another drug delivery company, Medco Health Solutions which pulled out of the UK market. Subsequently the company struggled to maintain services. In March 2014 Healthcare at Home said that it was no longer accepting new ‚Äòhigh risk‚Äô patients such as those suffering from haemophilia or respiratory diseases like cystic fibrosis because it could not guarantee getting their drugs to them on time or in full. The company blamed IT issues and a ‚Äòsystem failure‚Äô relating to the firm‚Äôs outsourcing of its logistics and warehousing departments. Dave Roberts, chief executive of the National Clinical Homecare Association, says there are questions about whether the rapid growth and low profit margins in the sector have contributed to the situation. ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs been 20% growth in this sector year on year for several years now in terms of numbers of patients ‚Äì that‚Äôs a very rapid expansion. But profits in this sector are just 2-4%. That is a poor return given the extent of capital investment needed and the governance and logistics issues. As NHS budgets have fallen, all the slack has been cut out of contracts,‚Äô Roberts added. In its 2014 accounts Healthcare at Home, which is majority-owned by private equity firm Vitruvian Partners, reported a turnover of ¬£1bn, with pretax profits of just ¬£15m. The chief executive Mike Gordon stepped down in June 2014 after the revelation that seven per cent of the firm‚Äôs 150,000 patients had not received their medication on time or in full during the last six months.

Viroqua High serves about 334 students, grades 9-12, and offers a variety of co-curricular sports and activities that include student council, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, tennis, volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, hockey, wrestling, baseball, softball, and track and field. Students at Viroqua High can take Advanced Placement courses and exams. The rate of participation for AP course work is currently 23 percent. History =Early History= The first school in Viroqua was taught by Mrs. Margaret C. Terhune, in the old log court house building during the latter part of the summer and fall of 1851. The school started two or three weeks after the arrival of W. F. Terhune and his wife. There were about sixteen scholars in attendance. The term lasted about three months and was paid for by subscription at $2 for each scholar. During the succeeding winter of 1851‚Äì2 Judge Terhune taught the school at the same place and upon the same plan. Jennie Clark, now Mrs. Messersmith had charge during the following summer. The old log building continued to be used for school purposes about two years, after which rooms were rented for public schools until 1856, when, the district having been organized, a school house was erected. It stood opposite the present residence of Warren Dunlap. It was, for those days, a commodious frame building, containing two rooms. School was then held in this building. Among the teachers who at different times had charge of the school while this building was in use were: R. C. Bierce, C. M. Butt, L. M. Perham, O. C. Smith, Mr. Moore, T. B. Brown and A. D. Chase. This school house was used for school purposes until 1868, when the present building was erected and the old one was sold to Charles Brown at auction. IIe moved it to a block east of his present place of business, where he used it for a shop for some time and finally sold it to J. H. Tate. It is now used as a dwelling house. The present building, as stated, was erected in 1868. It is a large stone structure, occupying an excellent site a few blocks east of the main part of town. The Viroqua high school was organized in 1876. A large brick edifice was erected a little east of the center of town, in 1882, at a cost of $2,400 for the high and grammar schools. The lower departments occupy the stone building formerly occupied by all the departments. In 1882‚Äì3 new furnaces were placed in both buildings and now the schools are heated and ventilated by the latest improved methods. The grounds surrounding the school are extensive and are beautified with different varieties of treeS. In 1883 the teachers were as follows: High school, C. J. Smith, principal; Lona Washburn, assistant; grammar department, Emma F. Howell, teacher; first intermediate department, Hattie E. Terrell; second intermediate department, Eliza Haughton; first primary department, Ida B. Coe; second primary, Hattie McRie. Thus it will be seen that the educational facilities of Viroqua are excellent, and the public schools are justly a matter of pride to the citizens. In 1883 the school board consisted of the following gentleman: Director, R. S. McMichael; clerk, H. A. Chase; treasurer, Earl M. Rogers. The committee upon examination of graduating class was composed of O. B. Wyman, William Haughton and C. J. Smith.History of Vernon County, Wisconsin: Together with Sketches of Its Towns, Villages and Townships, Educational, Civil, Military and Political History; Portraits of Prominent Persons, and Biographies of Representative Citizens; History of Wisconsin ...Published in 1884  Notable alumni  * Andrew H.

By 1986 Young was practicing as a naturopathic doctor in Tijuana, Mexico and offering cancer and lupus treatments, with a claimed 90% cure rate for the latter. Young became interested in essential oils after meeting with a French lavender distiller at a conference in California some time before traveling to France to learn distillation.

In 2008, David Stirling, was fired from the firm and - along with other ex-executives from Young Living - founded the rival company doTerra. doTerra aimed to sell essential oils to a wider client base than Young Living, and like Young Living they saw rapid growth in the market.

Business model Young Living employs a multi-level marketing model, recruiting \\"thousands of independent distributors who can sell directly to customers and earn commissions on sales to distributors recruited into a hierarchical network called 'downlines'.\\" Although distributors can potentially make a profit from direct sales, more money is made by commissions through sales made by people who the distributors recruit. Distributors are categorized based on their sales: the lowest rank with the least sales are referred to as simply \\"Distributors\\", while at the top are the \\"Royal Crown Diamonds.\\" In 2017, the New Yorker reported that distributors are required by Young Living to make $100 of purchases per month to qualify for a commission. According to a public income statement, in 2016 approximately 94% of Young Living's active members made less than a dollar, while less than one tenth of one percent (about one thousand Royal Crown Diamond distributors) made over a million dollars. According to an analysis of the company‚Äôs 2018 income disclosure statement by Business Insider, 89% of all members attempting their own business were on the bottom tier, earning an average of $4 annually, while those on the first three tiers, comprising 98.7% of active members, averaged between $4 and $1,551 annually, not counting required monthly costs to remain active with the company. Prohibited marketing claims In September 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Young Living against illegally marketing its products as possible treatments or cures for Ebola virus and other conditions, including \\"Parkinson‚Äôs disease, autism, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, insomnia, heart disease, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dementia, and multiple sclerosis\\", after they identified multiple instances of such claims being made by Young Living's distributors on social media and other websites.Andrews, Natalie (October 3, 2014) \\"FDA cracks down on sellers touting Ebola treatments\\", Wall Street Journal.

Interview by Sherrill Sutherland, The Globe and Mail, 2 June 2014. Their mission is to showcase Canadian fashion design nationally and internationally as well as introducing foreign designers to local Canadian markets. The FDCC aims to connect \\"designers, media, buyers, sponsors, and industry.\\" The current president of the FDCC is one of the founders Robin Kay. Joe Mimran, fashion designer best known for creating Club Monaco and Joe Fresh, is the current chairman of FDCC's board of directors. The FDCC's head office is currently located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Robin Kay, on behalf of the FDCC has been working tirelessly for the past several years to establish a first-ever sustainable mandate and federal charter that officially endorses the fashion industry in Canada as a crucial contributor to the country‚Äôs economic and cultural landscape. Robin Kay Robin Kay was born in 1950 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She left Winnipeg in 1965 to begin her life defining it her way. After travelling to Europe to work in retail, Kay returned to Canada, this time heading straight to Toronto where after a few stints working in major department stores, she decided it was time to work for herself. It was a lesson learned growing up in Winnipeg in a family of entrepreneurs where the how-to‚Äôs of business were schooled upon her simply by her being there, an education through osmosis, saying, ‚ÄúI grew up in a very commercial environment. My grandfather was a cooper, a barrel maker, my father didn‚Äôt go to school, he joined his father. From barrels they went into steel drums, the company then grew into plastics etc. So I really heard all of that. I learned the intensity of making, buying, selling.‚Äù Robin Kay founded the ‚ÄòRobin Kay‚Äô brand in Toronto in 1976. She wasn‚Äôt a designer but she describes herself as ‚Äúinstinctively‚Äù knowing how to sell. Kay took a shop on Bellair in Yorkville (an upscale area of Toronto), painted it all white, it had a little neon ‚ÄòRobin‚Äô sign on it. She then went over to Spadina (Toronto‚Äôs historic garment district) and got beautiful, never before worn army, navy clothes, carpenter shirts and carpenter overalls. And then one day, not long after, a woman walked through the door carrying a cotton sweater. She fell in love with that cotton sweater. The woman was from Switzerland and she made these pure cotton sweaters on the Dubied hand knitting machine. She and Robin became partners. Kay then opened a factory in downtown Toronto followed by a big knitting mill. (The brand) grew to 22-23 shops, 600 wholesale accounts across North America. For someone who wasn‚Äôt a designer or trained as one when she started, she was able to tap into the style of the time, perhaps even before its time whether it was a simple white t-shirt made from organic cotton before ‚Äòorganic‚Äô became fashionable or becoming a champion of sustainable fashion, making sweaters from unbleached and recycled yarn at a time when sustainable fashion wasn‚Äôt even a thing. For a while she and her business thrived. Until it didn‚Äôt. Debt and the economy would bring testing times in the form of a business partner to help the Robin Kay branch out. For someone who preferred to be self- sufficient, the partnership would prove to be misaligned with Kay‚Äôs life vision. She \\"lost the business to the Canadian firm Wing Son Garments\\", which she had taken on as a partner. The firm would do an about-turn and sever all ties with the woman whose brand bore her name. The new owner would own the ‚ÄòRobin Kay‚Äô name and would eventually change the brand name to ‚ÄòRK‚Äô. Three months after her ouster, Kay was diagnosed with breast cancer. It would take Robin Kay a year to heal and recover but she would never lose sight of her raison d'√™tre--to champion Canada's fashion talent. After given the all-clear, Robin was invited to chair a small provincial not-for-profit organisation called Designers Ontario which would inspire in her a need to create a national entity with a mission to champion the Canadian fashion industry. In 1999 she established the Fashion Design Council of Canada to build a stage on which Canadian designers and brands would be nurtured, supported, and celebrated. At the same time Kay had the idea to showcase Canadian designers with a \\"fashion week\\" to sit alongside the major events in New York, London, and Paris. Toronto Fashion Week, under the guidance and promotion of the FDCC, held its first event in 2000. Toronto Fashion Week was a coup for the city and the country. It would become the largest fashion week in Canada with its first major and title sponsor, L‚ÄôOr√©al, in 2002. In its decade under Kay, the event would grow in profits and prominence attracting global attention and major sponsors such as LG and World Mastercard. TFW would also grow to be the 2nd largest fashion week in North America, after New York Fashion Week. Robin Kay sold TFW to IMG in 2012 with the hopes that with IMG's vast resources and reach TFW would continue to grow and would play a dominant role in the fashion world. After selling TFW, Kay stepped down from her role as Executive Director of TFW. Telling the Globe and Mail newspaper, \\"The purpose in selling the event to IMG was to build out Toronto to more global exposure. This was the promise of IMG.‚Äù She went on to tell the paper, ‚ÄúIMG is a billion-dollar global corporation. And they failed.‚Äù But for a while, Kay took it as a personal failure saying, ‚ÄúI have to stand up sometimes and say 'look, Robin, you can‚Äôt look backwards, you have to look forwards.‚Äô Because I am troubled by the sale of fashion week to IMG. That was a total letdown. I sold it so well financially. It was an excellent event that only needed tweaking. I regret that, that I wasn‚Äôt paying more attention. I believed IMG because they had 28 fashion weeks and they knew what to do , but they didn‚Äôt.‚Äù With the FDCC, Robin Kay has been a vocal advocate for young Canadian designers trying to make their way through ever-changing business models and retail demands, and how they survive in a country where fashion is yet to be seen as art. Unlike Britain and France, Canada is the only G7country that does not include fashion as a cultural industry. Leaving Canadian designers and the industry for which they work and their nation's identity to which they contribute, essentially \\"orphans\\" as Kay describes it. Without much, if any, provincial and federal support, designers in Canada are swimming upstream in a world where the demands of a fashion house are like a pressure cooker for already-established brands, let alone those that are still trying to find their feet on unsure ground. And so the FDCC and Robin Kay in particular, are fighting tooth and nail for them, travelling the world carrying the Canadian flag so that they are recognised and supported. And for Ms. Kay it‚Äôs personal. She‚Äôs been there. She knows what it takes to survive and succeed. She knows the pressures and pitfalls. Kay is currently working on projects to establish a first-ever sustainable mandate and federal charter that officially endorses the fashion industry in Canada as a crucial contributor to the country‚Äôs economic and cultural landscape. Through her work with George Brown College, Kay is helping to educate designers of the future to become independent, creative, and confident artists that will add to the fabric that is Canadian culture and design. She is also an active advocate for working with organisations like the David Suzuki Foundation to find new solutions that will enable Canadian designers and brands to have available to them, new forms of creating that are not harmful to the environment. Robin Kay believes in, and has worked tirelessly to promote, the world class talent that is inherent in the fabric of Canada‚Äôs fashion industry. It has been, and continues to be, her mission to find solutions to the challenges they face as well as mentoring them to become successes in the business of fashion.

As a result of the change of ownership, Robin Kay stepped down from her position as Toronto Fashion Week executive director. However, in the subsequent years, Toronto Fashion Week has waned both in public support and private sponsorship.

Recording \\"Lincoln County\\" was recorded around the sessions of The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, and, like \\"Death of a Clown\\" and \\"Susannah's Still Alive\\", featured all of the members of the Kinks participating. Release Dave Davies' third solo 45 had a checkered history, two release dates came and went before it was released, contrary to popular belief the single was not released and withdrawn, although a handful of promo copies were date stamped with the previous release dates. The delays were partly down to PYE not wanting competing Kinks' product and the Kinks' uncertainty of what their next single would be and it was left waiting in the wings until an appropriate gap in the release schedule became available. \\"Lincoln County\\" was eventually released in June 1968, backed with \\"There Is No Life Without Love\\". Unlike the previous two Dave Davies singles (\\"Death of a Clown\\" and \\"Susannah's Still Alive\\"), the single flopped internationally and at home, only hitting #15 on the Dutch Singles Chart and missing the charts elsewhere. There was only modest promotion of the single by PYE, but surprisingly it did get good airplay on the BBC's fledgling Radio 1 as well a promotional film recorded to support its release. After this, Davies would only release one more single (\\"Hold My Hand\\") before putting his solo career on hold until 1980 (despite some solo dablings in the mid '70s after the Kinks own recording studios Konk opened in 1973) with his album Dave Davies (referred to in the US as AFL1-3603.) \\"Lincoln County\\" would have likely appeared on any Dave Davies solo album had it appeared in the second half of the 1960s, but an album was never released. It however has since appeared on numerous compilations including The Album That Never Was and the reissues of Something Else by the Kinks from 1997 onwards. Most notably it appeared on 2011's \\"Hidden Treasures\\" in remastered stereo, this album finally brought the whole tortured saga of the lost 1960s Dave Davies solo album into full public gaze. Reception \\"Lincoln County\\" has generally received positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic cited the song as a highlight from the Dave Davies compilation album Hidden Treasures.

Main terms The agreement was an effort to achieve an agreement about the conflicting territorial claims of the two countries. *Greece pledged to support the Italian claims over Vlor√´ and the establishment of an Italian protectorate over Albania. In Asia Minor, Greece would support the Italian claims over the parts of the sanjaks of Aydƒ±n and Menteshe, which were not already captured by the Greek army. A line of demarcation between Greek and Italian zones was drawn in the Maeander River valley. Greece would secure also for Italy a free zone at the port of Smyrna (under Greek administration from May 1919). *Italy pledged to support the Greek territorial claims over Northern Epirus and transfer the Dodecanese to Greece, except for the island of Rhodes, which would remain under Italian rule until such time as Cyprus would be ceded to Greece by Britain, at which time a referendum would be held for union with Greece. Developments In January 1920, Venizelos made known the agreement to the Supreme Allied Council with no negative reaction. The stance of Italy changed in July 1920, when the new Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Carlo Sforza, with a secret note to the Greek government renounced the agreement.

Early life and career Born in Montijo, Spain, Quintana and her family migrated to Mexico when she was 5 years old. She began her career working in theatre and later participated in films as an extra. Her first important role was as Carmen Ochoa in \\"Una soluci√≥n inesperada\\", a segment of the drama film Canasta de cuentos mexicanos (1956). She then enrolled in the National Association of Actors' theatre and film institute (Instituto Teatral y Cinematogr√°fico). She was given her first starring role in El buen ladr√≥n (1957) before her breakthrough in Bolero inmortal (1958), in which she debuted as a singer; the film's soundtrack album, for which she recorded songs, was a commercial success throughout Hispanic America. She starred opposite Pedro Armend√°riz, her favorite actor, in Dos hijos desobedientes (1960). Greatly admired by audiences for her beauty and talent, she became one of the most popular Mexican performers of the 1960s. Her last appearances were in the telenovelas El dolor de amar (1966), in which she played a villain for the first time, and Felipa S√°nchez, la soldadera (1967), in which the press declared she created \\"an unforgettable character\\" as the title role. Death and legacy Quintana, who never married, suffered from pancreatic problems and kidney failure during her last months. She died of a stroke on 8 August 1968, in Mexico City; she was survived by her mother, Alejandra Molina, and her two siblings, Juana Quintana Molina and Jos√© D√≠az Molina. She was interred at the Pante√≥n Jard√≠n on 9 August. A street in Montijo, her hometown, is named after her.

The church is a Grade I listed building. Location The church is located in sand dunes, about 20m from the high water mark of St George's Channel, at the southern end of the village of Llandanwg. It is also known as \\"the church in the sand\\". To the south west of the church is the mouth of the River Artro. History The current building is medieval, with the western end possibly dating back to the 13th century. However, the presence of 6th century inscribed stones, and the dedication to St Tanwg, suggest much earlier use of the site as a church, possibly dating to around 453 AD as part of Saint Patrick's work to establish links between Ireland and Britain. St Tanwg's was extended to the east, including a tall east window and the addition of a rood screen, in the 15th century. The church was restored in the 17th century when windows were rebuilt and changed. This was also probably when a choir loft was removed and floor beams moved to the back of the church. The initials REP and date 1685, which are cut into a cross incised stone on the west gable, may date this period of alteration. The first recorded incumbent for the parish was Rector Thomas Humphrey in 1662. The floor of the church was flagged in 1786 and, three years later, some medieval paintings were lost during replastering and repainting of the walls. St Tanwg's had been the parish church for the parish of Llandanwg, which included the small town of Harlech, for hundreds of years but between 1839 and 1841 a new parish church (also dedicated to St Tanwg) was built in Harlech. The old church was abandoned, and the 15th century octagonal font, bell and other furnishings, removed to the new building. The church soon fell into disrepair, with roof tiles lost, and the roof at the west end falling in. The church filled with sand and was used by fishermen who hung their nets on the altar rail. In 1884 the church was re-roofed for ¬£80 by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, who had raised an appeal for funds. Since then, more work has been done on various occasions, with a major restoration costing ¬£20,000 in 1987. Architecture St Tanwg's church is a simple rectangular building, long (west-east) and wide (north-south), with a continuous nave and chancel. The nave is probably 13th century, with the chancel added in the 15th century. The church is built of local rubble stone with larger stone quoins and gritstone dressings. The roof is of slate with rough stone dressings. alt= The church is accessed through a door in the west wall. The doorway is arched with radiating quoins. There was probably once a gabled porch above the doorway, indicated by the stonework above the entrance. Above the door, on the roof, is a small bellcote, housing one, undated, bell. The south wall includes a blocked of door from the 13th century, a window added to the nave in the 17th century, and a window in the 15th century chancel.. The north wall includes a window added to the nave in the 17th century, and a window in the 15th century chancel. The east wall was added as part of the 15th century extension of the building and included a tall window, which was replaced by a smaller window in the 17th century.

Some reviewers felt that Scorsese and Tedeschi were noticeably well disposed to the Review. The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"a warm, engaging, celebratory love letter from one New York institution to another\\" but commented on \\"the irony of a film that champions serious criticism without containing any serious criticism itself.\\" The English newspaper The Guardian concurred, observing that Scorsese and Tedeschi \\"are here to celebrate the magazine, not challenge it.

He is the founder and coach of Atlantis, an invitational 7s rugby team for developing rugby talent among both men and women. Women's rugby Signes is often referred to as \\"The Emperor\\" for his work growing and expanding the game of rugby sevens worldwide. In the official magazine for the first Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993, he was profiled among leaders in rugby sevens and called an \\"international legend.\\" With regard to the inclusion of rugby sevens in the Olympics: This is in line with the International Olympic Committee's focus of advancing the cause of women in sport. Coaching of coaches Signes has earned other notable nicknames: For having coached numerous players that went on to become coaches, as well as for having coached both parents and their children, Signes was given the nickname of \\"Grandcoach\\" by Paddy McNally, Northern Hemisphere Referee Selector for the Sevens World Series. At the 2011 USA Sevens Collegiate Rugby Championship in Philadelphia, 18 of the 24 teams in attendance were coached by players that had formerly played on one of Signes's teams. Many of the players coached by Signes have subsequently gone on to coach national rugby teams themselves, including Al Caravelli, Tom Billups, Kathy Flores, Pete Steinberg and Alex Magleby. Signes began coaching Princeton University Women's Rugby Club in 2004, helping them that year to the USA Rugby Collegiate Final Four. He led the team to two Ivy League championships (2005 and 2013). He also coached Princeton in the inaugural USA Sevens Women's Collegiate Rugby Championship. Signes retired from coaching 15s rugby in 2013 after serving as head coach to Princeton for 9 years, although he still works as a coaching consultant. Signes founded Atlantis US Sevens Rugby in 1986. Between 1986 and mid-2014 Atlantis ‚Äì men, women, boys, girls - has fielded 206 squads at 145 tournaments in 31 different countries. In their spring 2014 efforts, Atlantis Women won the Madrid Sevens (Spain) and the Atlantis High School Boys won the Surfside Sevens (NJ). Signes continues to coach rugby sevens through Atlantis, helping players of both genders to develop and compete for positions on the USA Sevens National Teams.

The #1 Swiss artist on Spotify, he was proclaimed a genius by British electronic dance music magazine Mixmag for his production and remixing talent. EDX is currently signed to the Spinnin' Deep sublabel of Spinnin' Records, although also releases via his own label Sirup Music. His radio mix show, No Xcuses, debuted in 2011 on Sirius XM and is now broadcast weekly on the Evolution platform on iHeartRadio. Biography Ethnically Calabrian and Campanian, EDX was born in Z√ºrich to Italian parents; he credits his Italian heritage for his involvement with music from a young age as well as his summer visits to Italy and experience with the dance music culture there, which influenced his interest in DJing and producing music. EDX's earliest releases were cassette tape mixes in 1994 for the \\"Tarot Techno\\" party series at in Z√ºrich. EDX released his first track, \\"I'm Not Interested\\", under Warner Music Switzerland in 1997. The following year, he formed his own record label, Club Control, on which he released several tracks including collaborations with Leon Klein. EDX's most well-known releases with Klein were \\"Gonna Catch You\\", which was picked up by Warner Music Switzerland, and DJ Dado's \\"Where Are You?\\" on Vale Music, both in 2000; the latter would peak at chart position #17 in Italy. The pair also released remixes of Kool & The Gang, Armand Van Helden, and Steve Angello. EDX also released several mix CDs during this time, both solo and with Klein, mostly for the Energy and Evolution series by Energetic Records, a sublabel of Warner Music. EDX returned to the music scene in 2007 with a more distinct progressive house style. His remix of Dubfire's \\"Roadkill\\" in 2007 featured on Armin van Buuren's Universal Religion Chapter 3. Over the following months, EDX released several more remixes, most notably of van Buuren's \\"The Sound of Goodbye\\" and Kaskade's \\"Angel on my Shoulder\\", the latter of which EDX credits for his breakthrough in the United States. He also collaborated with Tatana Sterba as a duo under the name Dobenbeck, releasing the track \\"Please Don't Go\\" featuring vocals by Sarah Vieth. EDX was named in the top 3 of Beatport's annual \\"Best Progressive House Artist\\" award, along with deadmau5 and Eric Prydz, in 2009.

Early life and education Albert Felix Etter was born near Shingle Springs in Eldorado County, California, on November 27, 1872. He was one of ten surviving children of the Swiss-born Benjamin Etter (d. 1889), all but one of whom were boys. Around 1876 the family moved to Humboldt County, where Benjamin acquired a farm near Ferndale and became the first person to grow lentils in the county. Development of Ettersburg Albert's German-born mother, Wilhelmina (Kern) Etter (d. 1913) was skilled at cultivating plants, and Etter showed a talent for hybridizing plants in childhood, working with apples, peaches, dahlias, and strawberries by the time he was twelve. He attended public school and by the end of his teens was looking out for a site where he could continue his plant-breeding experiments. On a fishing trip to the Mattole River Valley, he found a section of land above Bear Creek and in 1894 he staked a claim to it. This area along the Pacific coast in the King Range has wet winters and hot summers, and Etter later attributed his success partly to his choice of location. The site where Etter developed his ranch was subsequently named after him, first as Etter and then as Ettersburg. Etter managed the ranch with three of his brothers, George, Fred, and August; and another four of his siblings also lived nearby. While Etter focused on plant breeding, his brothers oversaw other kinds of farming and stockkeeping operations. The ranch holdings, operated under the business name Etter Brothers, eventually reached 800 acres in size. Although the Etter Brothers firm and the Ettersburg Experimental Place became internationally known among plant breeders, and Etter renowned as \\"the Luther Burbank of Humboldt County\\", they never made more than a modest living from the land. For one thing, they were far removed from the main trucking and rail routes, and for another, new plant hybrids were not protected by the patent system until 1930. Strawberry breeding Etter became known for his insistence on the value of using unimproved parent material, often taken from wild strains, and he frequently made 'wide' crosses between widely divergent genetic types. In his work with strawberries, he showed other breeders the value of the beach strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis) as a source of germplasm conveying vigor, productivity, flavor, and disease resistance. He also worked in a more minor way with F. virginiana species. By 1910, Ettersburg 121 had become the leading variety in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, because its firm flesh, high color, and strong flavor meant that it canned well. By 1920, Etter's catalog showcased over 50 new varieties, some of which achieved limited commercial success. None are commercially important today, although their germplasm continues in a number of modern cultivars. In 1928, he donated all of his strawberry material to the University of California, where his Ettersburg 121 became an ancestor of various commercially important varieties. =Strawberry varieties= *Beaderarena *Ettersburg 80 (Huxley) *Ettersburg 121 (an ancestor of the Northwest) *Ettersburg 450 (an ancestor of the Fairfax) *Fendalcino *Rose Ettersburg *Trebla (also known as Ettersburg Trebla) Apple breeding In 1899 it was reported that Albert Etter, with the help of the University of California, was establishing a private experimental orchard near Briceland. Etter started with 62 varieties in 1898 and was to receive several hundred more varieties. Years later Etter wrote about apple breeding at Ettersberg in the Pacific Rural Press (1922) He said that \\"the anniversary of my arrival here to begin operations was afterward made National Apple Day‚Äîthe 17th of October.\\" The Pacific Rural Press reported that he had 10,000 varieties of apples. He started with almost 600 apple varieties. These were gathered from America and Europe, with the help of Charles Howard Shinn, when he was Inspector of California Experiment Stations, between 1890 and 1901. In 1924, the Livermore Journal reported that he was about to introduce 75 different apple varieties. In the late 1920s, Etter shifted his attention to apple breeding, using scion wood gleaned from a number of sources including the University of California. He felt that the west coast climate called for new kinds of apples, and he began experimenting with wide crosses, especially between apples and crabapples. Although many of his apple strains have been lost, those that survive include Pink Pearl, the best-known of his unusual series of some two dozen pink- and red-fleshed cultivars based on a European apple called Surprise (itself probably a descendant of Malus niedzwetskyana). Some eastern and midwestern breeders, including Liberty Hyde Bailey and Charles Downing had already made some experiments with Surprise and been unhappy with the results, but Etter found that it worked much better as part of a west-coast breeding program. By 1928, Etter was far enough along in his breeding experiments to publish a preliminary report in the Pacific Rural Press, where he wrote up two of his pink-fleshed cultivars, the Redflesh Winter Banana and a nameless seedling that, by its description, might have been Pink Pearl. Subsequently, the midwestern breeder Niels Ebbesen Hansen worked on breeding red-fleshed apples and crabapples, expressing disappointment when he found that Etter had beaten him to the punch. Although not all of Etter's Surprise descendants were successful, the best of them shared a pronounced aromatic quality that appears to be linked to the anthocyanin pigmentation that gives the flesh its distinctive pinkish and reddish tones. In 1940, Etter began a partnership with George Roeding Jr., the owner of the California Nursery Company in Niles (now a district of Fremont, CA). Their goal was to patent and market Etter's best apple varieties. The California Nursery Company introduced six Etter varieties in its 1944 catalog - Pink Pearl and five apples with regular non-pigmented flesh (Alaska, All Gold, Humboldt Crab, Jonwin, and Wickson). A seventh apple, Crimson Gold, was introduced in the 1947 catalog. In the 1970 catalog carried only five varieties of Etter's apples: Alaska, Etter's Gold, Jonwin, Pink Pearl, and Wickson. A flyer with \\"Distinctive New Recipes....for the Apples of Albert Etter\\" was provided in a catalog. Recipes were by Robert Stoney Mayock who was a winemaker (Los Amigos Vineyards in Irvington), amateur chef and gourmet, and food columnist. =Apple varieties= *Alaska (a white apple, originally Bedfordshire Junior; U.S. patent #699, June 18, 1946) *Crimson Gold (apple) (originally Little Rosybloom) *Etter's Gold (originally Allgold; U.S. patent #659, April 28, 1945) *Hoover Redflesh *Humboldt (originally Jumbo Transcendent; U.S. patent #658, June 5, 1945) *Jonwin (U.S. patent #710, Sept. 17, 1946) *Katharine (named for Etter's wife) *Pink Pearl (U.S. patent #723) *Redflesh Spizenberg *Redflesh Winter Banana *Waltana (named for Etter's brother Walter and his wife) *Wickson crabapple (named for Edward J. Wickson; U.S. patent #724, March 4, 1947) Other plant breeding Etter also experimented with breeding over a hundred varieties of forage plants, grasses, and clovers. His research showed that some of the large white clovers from southern Europe were suitable for Humboldt County dairy farmers to use for forage because they put on a great deal of growth during the winter. He also undertook some experiments with tree nut crops such as English walnuts, chestnuts and filberts. Etter was a member of the California Nurserymen's Association and the American Pomological Society, and he was president of the Ettersburg Farm Center (a branch of the Humboldt County Farm Bureau). Etter died in November 1950. His wife Katharine (born Katharine McCormick in 1891) outlived him by nearly three decades, dying in 1979. In the 1970s, apple fancier Ram Fishman visited the remains of Etter's experimental orchard and found over one hundred trees still thriving. On many of these trees, multiple test varieties were represented, often by a single grafted branch. Fishman ultimately located about half of Etter's pink-fleshed varieties in the test orchard and in nearby areas, and in 1983 he founded the Greenmantle Nursery to make seven of them available to the public. They were given new names since the old names could not be firmly determined and are marketed under the Rosetta series title.

Shortly after his arrest in April 2013, the author dropped all references to the use of the word Singapore from his work, and changed his style from multiple panel comics to mostly single panel cartoons. Legal issues In December 2012, the Attorney General's Chamber sent a demand letter to Leslie Chew to take down and apologise for a comic, to which he refused. In April 2013, Leslie Chew was arrested for sedition over a comic which he has created in March 2013 that shows the population percentile of the Malay population steadily decreasing over the years despite their consistently higher Total Fertility Rate vs the other races. His parents' home was raided and the police confiscated all the computers, data storages, phones in the property, as well as impounded his passport.

He was the brother and successor of Khurshid of Dailam.  Biography  Map of northern Iran Justan is first mentioned in 865, when he was placed on the Justanid throne by his suzerain, the Alid ruler Hasan ibn Zayd, who had deposed Justan's brother Khurshid because of his hostility towards the Alids. In 866/7, Justan fought against the Abbasid governor of Ray, 'Abd-Allah ibn 'Aziz. Justan eventually won, killing and capturing many inhabitants of the city. Justan later agreed to leave the city after having been paid 2,000,000 dirhams. In 869, the Abbasid military officer Muflih al-Turki invaded Tabaristan, and defeated Justan at the nearby city of Qazvin. Fortunately for the Alids, however, Muflih shortly left the region. In ca. 889, Justan aided the new Alid ruler Muhammad ibn Zayd against the ruler of Khorasan, Rafi ibn Harthama. In 900, the Samanids, who had become the new masters of Khorasan, defeated the Alids at Gurgan and conquered their domains in Tabaristan. They also shortly managed to defeat Justan, but failed to conquer his territory. Some time later, Justan welcomed another Alid named Hasan al-Utrush, who had taken refugee at Ray after the Samanid conquest of Tabaristan. Together, Justan and Hasan tried in 902 and 903 to recover control of Tabaristan, but without success. Worried by the fickleness of Justan, Hasan resolved to build a power base of his own. He therefore went on a mission to the as-yet unconverted Gilites and Dailamites to the north of the Alborz mountains, where he preached in person and founded mosques. His efforts were swiftly crowned by success: the mountain Daylamites and the Gilites east of the Safid Rud river recognized him as their imam with the name of al-NƒÅ·π£ir li'l-·∏§aqq (\\"Defender of the True Faith\\") and were converted to his own branch of Zaydi Islam, which was named after him as the Nasiriyya and differed in some practices from the \\"mainstream\\" Qasimiyya branch adopted in Tabaristan following the teachings of Qasim ibn Ibrahim. This development threatened the position of Justan, but in the ensuing showdown between the two Hasan was able to affirm his position and compel Justan to swear allegiance to himself. Justan was murdered in 919 by his brother Ali of Dailam, who became the new ruler of the Justanids. However, Justan's murder was shortly avenged by his son-in-law Muhammad ibn Musafir who had married his daughter Kharasuya and was from another Dailamite dynasty known as the Sallarids, which ruled over Tarum.

Situated in the Western Maine Mountains in the Northwest Somerset Region, the pond is located in a deep mountain valley between Coburn Mountain (to the east) and Shutdown Mountain (to the west). Near its southern end, the pond is distinguished by two rockslides from the exposed cliffs of these mountains that extend down into the water along both shores. Enchanted Pond is fed by mountain springs and Little Enchanted Pond, and is the primary source of Enchanted Stream which flows into the Dead River, a tributary of the Kennebec River. Development on the pond is limited to a small set of sporting camps at the northern end of the pond and one remote camp on the southwest shore, both a part of Bulldog Camps. There are no islands in the pond. Enchanted Pond is exceptionally deep, and has only a very narrow area of shallow water along its shoreline. Rock and gravel make up the majority of its shores with many large boulders in the rockslide areas and a few sandy beaches, one on the east side directly across from another on the west side, and one on the south shore near the outlet. There is very little aquatic vegetation, resulting in excellent water clarity and oligotrophic conditions. The pond was last surveyed by the State of Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in August, 1979 when the water temperature was determined to be 66 ¬∞F at the surface and 41 ¬∞F at a depth of 100 feet. History Shutdown Mountain, with 800-foot (244 m) cliffs rising up abruptly from Enchanted Pond, gave the pond its alternative name \\"Bulldog Pond\\" sometime in the mid to late 1800s. Its shale face, along with the rocky cliff that forms the western side of Coburn Mountain resembled the profile of two bulldogs looking across the pond at one other. Since there were other ponds with the name Enchanted, it seemed a good way to uniquely identify this pond in particular. Enchanted Pond has attracted visitors for well over a century, from early lumbermen who worked out of the logging camps on its north shore to later sportsmen seeking the outdoor tranquility, seclusion, and hunting and fishing opportunities it provided. 19th-century \\"rusticators\\" traveled by railroad and after the turn of the century float plane fly-in service became popular for anglers. Guests can spare themselves the arduous ten mile hike in from U.S. Route 201 via the access road built by the owner of Bulldog Camps in 2005. Various species dwell among the surrounding cliffs and talus slopes, including peregrine falcons, bald eagles and common loons. The region also has a large moose and bear population. The shores of the pond are scattered with various fossil rocks millions of years old. =Namesake= The Enchanted region includes not just Enchanted Pond, but mountain spring-fed Little Enchanted Pond which runs into Upper Enchanted Stream, then into Enchanted Pond, back into Enchanted Stream, into Lower Enchanted Pond and Lower Enchanted Stream, then on to the Dead River. The area was named for the many \\"enchanting: things that happened there: the upper reaches of Enchanted Stream would go underground from time to time and then pop up again several hundred feet away; men in the woods of the Enchanted would search for the source of laughter or voices they heard, only to find themselves alone in the forest; hunters would follow tracks in the snow out onto frozen Enchanted Pond only to find them disappear in the middle and they could follow them no more.Arlen, Alice. Maine Sporting Camps: A Year-Round Guide to Vacationing at Traditional Hunting & Fishing Lodges. 3rd ed. Woodstock: The Countryman, 2003. Print. =H.P. McKenney log sluice= The pond is the historic site of H.P. McKenney‚Äôs famous log sluice built in 1898. After several failed attempts at procuring financial assistance to help him with the project, it was apparent that no one believed his modern feat of engineering would work, so Henry Patrick McKenney took it upon himself to finance the job and he and his men spent the next two years constructing a wooden sluiceway down Enchanted Stream to run his logs from Enchanted to the Dead River, saving him a significant amount of mileage to the mill compared to his old route via the Moose River over to Moosehead Lake and down the Kennebec River. Logs were cut on site with four-inch-thick pine planks used for the flooring and three inch planks for the sides. Several trestles were built over deep gullies, ravines, and boulders, from ten feet high up to thirty feet high in places. A wooden dam was constructed at the outlet in order to hold the water back until it was needed for the drive in the spring, although there was no guarantee that the sluice would actually work. In the spring of 1900, after years of backbreaking work, anxiety, and mounting debts, McKenney gave the order to open the gate at the dam, the first load of long logs were guided into the sluice, and down they sped. It was said that it only took the logs one and a quarter minutes to travel the length of the one and a quarter mile sluiceway. In reference to the previously popular opinion that such a sluice could not be successful, some would sarcastically remark at how many huge stacks of logs now waited in the surrounding woods to be sent down H.P.‚Äôs Folly. Brook trout caught out of Enchanted Pond, June 2007 Fish Although water chemistry and conditions are excellent for cold water game fish at all depths, Enchanted Pond is not a very productive pond due to so much of its area being so deep. There are two small tributaries at the northern end of the pond that are good spawning areas for the pond‚Äôs population of native brook trout maintained only through natural reproduction. The Enchanted Stream inlet also produces many young trout for the pond as it is an excellent spawning and nursery habitat as well. The Enchanted Stream outlet does not allow for the passage of fish into the pond due to the remains of the old, wooden driving dam, though natural barriers downstream have also prevented other fish species which occur in the drainage from entering Enchanted Pond. There currently exists a regulation prohibiting the use or possession of live bait in order to prevent the introduction of any new species to the pond which is currently being managed for its wild brook trout population. Geography Looking north from Enchanted Lookout in autumn Set at an elevation of 1,443 feet (440 m), Enchanted Pond is approx. 2 miles long by a half mile wide (3.2 km by 0.8 km), with an area of 1 mile¬≤ (2.6 km¬≤), and over 5 miles (8 km) of shoreline. Its major inlet is Enchanted Stream, which flows southeast from Little Enchanted Pond into the northwest corner of Enchanted. To the northeast, a stream fed by springs on Coburn Mountain is its second largest tributary. Flowing out of Enchanted Pond to the south is its only outlet, Lower Enchanted Stream with leads to Lower Enchanted Pond. Enchanted Pond is located in Upper Enchanted Township in Somerset County, Maine. During the last glacial era, hundreds of natural lakes and ponds were carved into the surrounding landscape, varying in size from one acre (4,000 m¬≤) ponds to Moosehead Lake, at 74,890 acres (303 km¬≤) one of the largest natural freshwater lakes in the United States. Access to the pond is limited to a few hiking trails and the road built to access Bulldog Camps. Development New Hampshire-based Wagner Forest Management oversees the land surrounding the pond as part of its 2.7 million acres of forestland managed as a timberland investment for several select clients. The land is open to the public for low-impact activities such as hunting, fishing and hiking in an attempt to bring residents, money, and tourists to Maine. The land is protected from further development as no other buildings are allowed to be built outside of the existing sporting camps on the north shore. Many areas around the pond have been logged since the 1860s all the way up to clear- cutting that began in the 1970s.

It was released worldwide through November and December 2014, and it is the third entry in the main LittleBigPlanet series, eighth entry overall. It was announced at Sony's E3 2014 media briefing on 9 June 2014. It was developed primarily by Sumo Digital, with XDev and series creator Media Molecule assisting in an undisclosed capacity. LittleBigPlanet 3 received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the visuals, the create mode, and the many new gameplay elements, such as the addition of the new characters. The game did however draw criticism for its technical issues. Gameplay LittleBigPlanet 3 features gameplay elements very similar to the first two games in the main LittleBigPlanet series, LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2. As such, it is a puzzle platformer game which features elements of a sandbox game. Like other LittleBigPlanet games, LittleBigPlanet 3 places a heavy emphasis on creation. Players create their own levels, characters, objects, such as power ups, tools, decorations, stickers, or vehicles, hub levels, Pods (effectively the character's 'home'), and other things. Players may share their creations. The core gameplay revolves around navigating colourful and vibrant levels with a set character, using power ups, jumping, swimming, swinging, grabbing, interacting with switches and non-player characters, defeating enemies, completing the main objectives, and finding collectibles, such as Collectibells, stickers, materials, objects, and gadgets. = Characters and abilities = LittleBigPlanet 3 introduces three new characters in addition to Sackboy, each with their own unique traits and abilities. OddSock is a four- legged, dog-like character who can run faster than Sackboy and can wall-jump. Swoop is a bird-like character who can fly freely around levels and can pick up other light objects. In addition to objects, Swoop can pick up other characters, with the exception of Big Toggle. Toggle is another character, who can transform between a large, heavy version and a small, light version. The larger version, called Big Toggle, is much heavier than Sackboy and can weigh down platforms or pressure plates. His miniature version is called Little Toggle, and can walk quickly on the surface of water, is very small and can fit through tight spaces. Level creators have the ability to allow players to play as more than one character during gameplay. In addition, Sackboy has a climbing ability which works on rope-based textures like vines. LittleBigPlanet 3 has several power-ups which, when equipped, give players additional abilities. One such power-up, the \\"Pumpinator\\", blows air to move light objects. In addition to pre-made power-ups, creators are able to make their own using the new Power-up Creator. There are 70 tools, in addition to enhanced ones retained from three previous titles, LittleBigPlanet, LittleBigPlanet 2 and LittleBigPlanet PS Vita. = Backwards compatibility = All previous downloadable content packs from LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2 are fully backwards compatible, being transferable to LittleBigPlanet 3 on both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 versions. However, story progression logged from LittleBigPlanet 3s predecessors does not transfer onto the PlayStation 4 version of the game. =User-created levels = In LittleBigPlanet 3, players can play any levels created in LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2. The PlayStation 4 version of the game is rendered with an improved graphics engine and textures at 1080p resolution, while the PlayStation 3 version renders everything at 720p. Unlike previous games in the series which had three playable layers of depth, LittleBigPlanet 3 allows creators to use 16 layers. Players are limited by the classic Thermometer rules by default, but players can choose to use the new \\"Dynamic Thermometer\\" streaming for levels. In addition, players can extend, or \\"stitch\\", their levels to make them longer. Plot LittleBigPlanet 3 begins in a white void, as the Narrator (Stephen Fry) teaches controls on how to use the player character Sackboy. Midway through the opening, Newton (Hugh Laurie) interrupts the Narrator, and uses one of his devices to create a wormhole. This wormhole sends Sackboy to another world called Bunkum, where he is greeted by Newton. Newton begins to tell a story on how Nana Pud is going to unleash three Titans that were sealed away long ago in a tea jar by Bunkum's heroes. The duo fly off in Newton's airship, landing on the doorstep of Nana Pud's home, Stitchem Manor. Newton stays behind, to \\"boil some eggs\\" as Sackboy infiltrates Stitchem Manor. Sackboy reaches the roof, defeating all of Nana Pud's security measures. Newton appears, revealing that it was his plan to unleash the titans to make Bunkum more creative, and that Nana Pud was his mother, who warned him not to open the jar. Newton proceeds to open the jar, unwittingly getting possessed by the three Titans. As a result, Newton flings Sackboy off the roof. Nana Pud and Sackboy strike an alliance after Nana finds out Newton tricked Sackboy, to which Nana suggests that they reawaken the three heroes of Bunkum. First, they reach Manglewood, where the first hero is held. The Creator Curator, Marlon Random, helps Sackboy find the three marbles needed to reawaken the hero. Once the hero, Oddsock, is found, Newton unleashes the first Titan to try and defeat Sackboy and company. The pair defeat the Titan, moving onto the next world. They reach The Ziggurat, home to the creator curator Papal Mache. Once again, they reacquire the marbles, reawakening Toggle, a hero that can change size at will. Newton once again tries to slow down the heroes by unleashing the second Titan, which also gets defeated. Finally, the trio reach the Bunkum Lagoon, hosted by the vain Pinky Bufflooms. After reawakening Swoop, the final hero, Newton appears to be trapped and cornered by the four heroes. At the last moment, he traps Sackboy, forcing the heroes to save him. Newton is stopped from getting away with Sackboy, becoming furious and releases the third Titan inside his own fortress. This act relinquishes control back to his normal self, dropping his malevolent and rude behavior. Newton and the four of the heroes confront the final Titan. They blow up the third titan whilst destroying Newton's fortress. Nearly falling to their death, Newton, Sackboy, Toggle, Swoop, and Oddsock are saved by Newton's father, Captain Pud. The four heroes are flown back to Stitchem Manor, where Newton builds a new portal to send them back to the Craftworld. =Cast= LittleBigPlanet 3 is fully voice-acted, including cutscenes and gameplay, whereas previous games only featured voice acting during cutscenes. As in previous LittleBigPlanet games, Stephen Fry narrates. Other actors for the game include Hugh Laurie as Newton, the main antagonist of the game, Lewis MacLeod as Oleg and Captain Pud, Newton's father, Tara Strong as Coach Rock and Vera Oblonsky, Robbie Stevens as Larry Da Vinci, Peter Serafinowicz as Dr. Maxim, El Jeff, and Papal Mache, Lorelei King as Elena and Felica, John Guerrasio as Guard 1 and Guard 2, Martin T.

[...] It was really cool to get a sense of what they were thinking, how the game came out like it did, what was their vision for it, what limitations did they put on themselves.\\" Media Molecule stressed to Sumo Digital that the game's story must set a good example to what players can accomplish themselves in Create mode. Hosen said this concept helped \\"everything make sense [...] it all just clipped into place. [...] Those personal insights we got from them early on were invaluable in shaping how we made the rest of the game.\\" During the game's development process, around 20 prolific members of the LittleBigPlanet community were selected to work alongside Sony XDev to provide feedback and offer suggestions on the game's mechanics.Parker, Laura. (23 July 2014). \\"For Little Big Planet 3, Sony's Getting Development Help From the Community\\". GameSpot. Retrieved 6 September 2015. Additionally, the game's introduction sequence ‚Äì which is a combination of live action footage and visual effects ‚Äì was produced by the UK studio Carbon Digital. Carbon digital \\"worked closely\\" with Sumo Digital during the production of the video.Batchelor, James. (1 December 2014). \\"Carbon Digital creates LittleBigPlanet 3 intro\\". Develop. Retrieved 6 September 2015. Early in the game's development, all of the playable characters were initially designed as silhouettes. The developers created \\"loads\\" of silhouettes and chose the best ones, which were then fully designed, and eventually became Oddsock, Swoop, and Toggle. (Sackboy, previously the only playable character, underwent minimal changes.) Oddsock and Swoop's designs were thought of early on and required no major redesigns. However, Toggle was initially just the 'big' character, and could not change into a smaller version of himself. Toggle was then revamped and the 'toggle' idea was implemented; without it, there weren't \\"enough combinations\\" or gameplay variety for the player. Pete Smith of SCE Worldwide Studios said the characters \\"needed to be game changers, they need to be fully customizable, they needed to feel like they belonged in the world, and they needed to have personality. I think the final three characters have really struck that balance.\\" One character that was scrapped early on was 'Sackworm'; Smith said: \\"The Sackworm didn't last too long before he found himself on the cutting room floor.\\"Nunneley, Stephany. (20 June 2014). \\"Poor Sackworm didn‚Äôt make the cut in LittleBigPlanet 3\\". VG247. Retrieved 31 August 2015.

It received an aggregated score of 80.78% on GameRankings based on 50 reviews and 79/100 on Metacritic based on 76 reviews. Justin Clark from Joystiq gave the game a 4.5/5, praising the level design, change of pacing and scale in adventure mode, new characters and items, as well as the Hook Hat, a new feature in LittleBigPlanet 3. He also praised the user-friendly and satisfying creation mode and accessible tutorial. He stated that \\"LittleBigPlanet 3 is a foundation, upon which eager minds can start building even more inspiring content, and that process has been made more accessible than ever before.\\" Louise Blain from GamesRadar gave the game an 8/10, praising the inclusion of a tutorial, distant characters and intuitive menu. However, she criticized the adventure mode for being too short and having frustrating checkpoints, as well as slightly disappointing pre-built content. She summarized the review by saying: \\"Beautiful, creative and filled with knitted joy, LittleBigPlanet 3 does however disappoint in its Adventure mode's comparatively sparse content. Nonetheless, it hands over an impressive array of exceptional design tools for budding creators.\\" Kevin Dunsmore from Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3.5/5, saying \\"LittleBigPlanet 3 is an endearing and charming game that will work its way into your heart thanks to its presentation and new characters. The end- game possibilities are endless thanks to the co-op, level creator and millions of community driven stages imported from past titles, but it's held back due to Sumo Digital's unwillingness to fully flesh out their ideas.\\" Alexa Ray Corriea from GameSpot gave the game a 7/10. She praised the soundtrack, new characters introduced, drastic and refreshing gameplay changes when controlling different characters, freedom of movement and navigation, challenging but rewarding levels, as well as Popit Puzzles, a tutorial introduced in the creative mode. However, she criticized the limited use of other characters in both Adventure Mode and co-op multiplayer, as well as multiple game-breaking bugs. She stated that \\"The push for creativity is limited in the way you play the campaign, but it's an overwhelming presence within creation mode, offering boundless ways to leave your own mark on Craftworld.\\" Polygon's Philip Kollar scored the game a 7 out of 10 and wrote: \\"Despite switching to a new developer, it has the big ideas and wide-eyed, arms-open demeanor of the series at its best. Yet it never totally commits, never goes all the way with its new concepts and characters. LittleBigPlanet 3s devoted fans will surely craft some excellent levels in the months to come, but mostly this feels like a proof of concept for a much better LittleBigPlanet 4.\\" Writing for Destructoid, Chris Carter scored the game a 7.5 out of 10. He said: \\"With all of the innovations LittleBigPlanet 3 brings with Toggle, Oddsock, and Swoop, it's a shame they aren't allowed to show off their stuff on a regular basis, because they are the best thing to happen to the series in years. It would be nice to see them return in a big way in a potential sequel, but for now hardcore LBP fans should have enough creation options to last them until that point.\\" Chris Schilling from Eurogamer scored the game a 7/10. He praised the game's new additions and improvements, as well as the create mode tutorials, but heavily criticized the presence of technical issues, saying he thought they dragged down the game. Schilling summed up the review by stating: \\"Held together by Sellotape rather than superglue, LittleBigPlanet 3 is in constant danger of falling apart.\\" Lucy O'Brien of IGN gave the game a mixed review. She scored it a 6.8/10, praising the design and visuals, but criticizing the \\"game-breaking\\" technical problems. O'Brien said: \\"LittleBigPlanet 3 is an enormous ‚Äì and, at times, unruly ‚Äì game. [Its] Adventure mode is beautifully designed, and new power-ups and character abilities switch up the usual bread-and-butter platforming gameplay, but it's let down by limited options for co-operative play and most significantly, a number of game-breaking bugs on the PlayStation 4. While a little daunting for newcomers, its supersized creation tookit has enormous potential for creating deep and diverse play, and it's here where LittleBigPlanet 3 justifies its existence.\\"  Notes  References External links * Official website * Sumo Digital website Category:2014 video games Category:Electronic circuit simulators Category:LittleBigPlanet Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games scored by Winifred Phillips Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Video games with user-generated gameplay content Category:Sumo Digital games ","title":"LittleBigPlanet 3"},{"id":"43013084","text":"John Leonard Knapp (9 May 1767 ‚Äì 29 April 1845) was an English botanist and naturalist. He is best known for his Journal of a Naturalist, and his work on British grasses. History Born at Shenley, Buckinghamshire, John Leonard Knapp was the son of Primatt Knapp, rector of Shenley. Educated at Thame grammar school, Knapp entered the navy, but finding the sea unsuited to his health, he resigned and served successively in the Herefordshire and Northamptonshire militia, becoming a captain in the latter. He lived for a time at Powick, near Worcester, and was then in the habit of making long summer botanical excursions. On one of these he visited Scotland in company with Scottish botanist George Don and collected several of the rarest species of British native grasses. =Publications= In 1804 he published Gramina Britannica, or Representations of the British Grasses on 119 coloured plates, with Descriptions, in quarto, the figures being executed by himself. This edition was, with the exception of a hundred copies, destroyed by a fire at Bensley's, the printers, and the book was not reissued until 1842. In 1818 Knapp published anonymously a poem entitled \\"Arthur, or the Pastor of the Village,\\" and between 1820 and 1830 a series of articles, under the title of ‚ÄòThe Naturalist's Diary,‚Äô in the almanac series ‚ÄòTime's Telescope.‚Äô These formed the germ of his most successful work, the Journal of a Naturalist, published anonymously in 1829, which went through three editions during his lifetime. It was published in America in 1853 as Country Rambles in England with an introduction and notes by Susan Fenimore Cooper. Knapp viewed it as a botanical companion to Gilbert White's ‚ÄòSelborne.‚Äô =Personal life= He lived till 1813 at Llanfoist, near Abergavenny, and subsequently at Alveston, near Bristol, where he died. In 1804 he married Lydia Frances Freeman (1772-1838), daughter of Arthur Freeman of Antigua, by whom he had seven children; two sons and a daughter survived him. His son Arthur John Knapp (d. 1883) was a Bristol solicitor and one of the original promoters of the Great Western Railway.The Solicitors' Journal and Reporter, Volume 27 (1883), p. 300 Commemoration Knapp became in 1796 a fellow of the Linnean Society, and was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. The genus of grasses previously named Mibora by Michel Adanson was renamed Knappia by Smith, although the original name is now used. Rhynchoglossum, originally named by Carl Ludwig Blume, was similarly unsuccessfully renamed Knappia by Franz Bauer in 1840. \\\\---- ;Taxonomy References Category:British botanists Category:Agrostologists Category:1767 births Category:1845 deaths Category:English botanical writers Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:Fellows of the Linnean Society of London Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London Category:19th-century English writers Category:19th-century British botanists Category:People from the Borough of Milton Keynes Category:People from Abergavenny Category:People from Alveston ","title":"John Leonard Knapp"},{"id":"43013122","text":"The 1985 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was the 26th conference playoff in league history and 33rd season where a WCHA champion was crowned.

He originally joined them in 2004 as a game designer for the Armored Core series, later becoming known for creating the Souls series, starting with Demon's Souls in 2009. Other games he has worked on include Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Miyazaki's influences range from the works of various novelists, mangakas, and other game designers such as Fumito Ueda and Yuji Horii, as well as Asian and European architecture. Miyazaki's games, particularly the Souls series, often invoke the use of high difficulty, strong visual and environmental storytelling, and a large amount of setting and character background information provided through mostly vague flavor text. His work in the Souls series has been seen as influential, with him winning awards and being cited as an auteur of the video game medium. Early life Miyazaki grew up \\"tremendously poor\\" while living in the city of Shizuoka, Japan, stating that he had no life ambitions as a child. Despite that, he was a heavy reader, but as his parents could not afford to buy him books or manga, he had to borrow from his local library. The books he read at the time, many in English, were sometimes beyond his reading capabilities, with parts he could not fully understand. Using his imagination to fill in the blanks by using the accompanying illustrations, Miyazaki used this as inspiration for some of his later ideas on video game design. Alongside this, he was restricted from playing video games by his parents until he was old enough to attend university, so he instead played gamebooks and tabletop games such as Steve Jackson's Sorcery! and Dungeons & Dragons. Career After graduating from Keio University with a degree in social science, Miyazaki went to work doing account managing for the US based Oracle Corporation. Upon a friend's recommendation, Miyazaki began playing the 2001 video game Ico, causing him to consider a career change to a game designer. At age 29 however, Miyazaki found that few game companies would employ him, with one of the few being FromSoftware, where Miyazaki began working as a game planner on Armored Core: Last Raven in 2004, joining the game's development halfway through. Miyazaki later directed Armored Core 4 and its direct sequel, Armored Core: For Answer. Upon learning about what later became Demon's Souls, Miyazaki became excited at the prospect of a fantasy action role-playing game and offered to help. The project, up until Miyazaki was assigned to it, was considered a failure by the company, with Miyazaki stating \\"I figured if I could find a way to take control of the game, I could turn it into anything I wanted. Best of all, if my ideas failed, nobody would care ‚Äì it was already a failure.\\" Although the game was received negatively at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show and sold far under expectations upon release, it began to pick up after a few months and soon found publishers willing to release the title outside of Japan. After the release and success of the game's spiritual successor Dark Souls in 2011, Miyazaki was promoted to the position of company president in May 2014. After the release of the Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls in August 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment approached FromSoftware concerning cooperative development on a new title. Miyazaki asked about the possibility of developing a game for eighth-generation consoles, and the concept of Bloodborne developed from there. There were no story or setting connections to FromSoftware's previous games, even though Miyazaki conceded that it carried the \\"DNA\\" of Demon's Souls and its specific level design. Development ran parallel to that of Dark Souls II, which Miyazaki supervised only as he was unable to direct both games simultaneously. After the release of Bloodborne in March 2015, Miyazaki returned to the Souls series as the director on Dark Souls III (2016), with assistance from Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor and Dark Souls II directors Isamu Okano and Yui Tanimura, respectively. After its release, Miyazaki stated his intentions to personally stop development on the Souls series. His next two projects were the 2018 virtual reality game D√©racin√© and the 2019 action-adventure game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. At the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards ceremony, he was awarded the show's Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the video game industry. The award was presented to him by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson, two of his design influences. Miyazaki is also set to direct the action role-playing game Elden Ring, written in collaboration with A Song of Ice and Fire series author George R. R. Martin. Influences and design philosophy Miyazaki's influences include video games such as Ico, the early Dragon Quest games, and The Legend of Zelda and King's Field video game series, manga series such as Berserk, Saint Seiya, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and Devilman, the literary works of H. P. Lovecraft, Bram Stoker, and George R. R. Martin, and gamebooks such as Steve Jackson's Sorcery! and RuneQuest. Miyazaki is also inspired by architecture, especially of Europe, and often uses it as a way of environmental storytelling. Psychology, sociology, and the history of humanity have also influenced his design philosophy. The multiplayer mechanics of the Souls series were inspired by his own personal experience of driving up on a snowy road as cars ahead began slipping back and were pushed up hill by other people in the area. As Miyazaki was unable to give his appreciation to them before leaving the area, he wondered whether the last person in the line had made it to their destination, thinking that he would probably never meet them again. This gave birth to the series' interconnected multiplayer systems, with it attempting to emulate that same sense of silent cooperation in the face of adversity. Miyazaki stated that the notable difficulty of the Souls series had no intention of being more difficult than other games. Rather, the difficulty was a part of the process that gives players a sense of accomplishment by \\"overcoming tremendous odds\\", while also having a certain level of difficulty incentivizing players to experiment more with character builds and weapons. He stated that death in his games are meant to be used as a trial and error learning tool, adding that the idea was only accepted by players following the success of Demon's Souls. When asked about his style of storytelling, Miyazaki stated that despite what others may believe, he does not dislike direct storytelling, but instead prefers players to interpret the world for themselves; stating that the player gets more value from it when \\"they themselves find out hints of plot from items or side-characters they encounter in the world\\". Many gaming journalists and critics have called him an \\"auteur\\" of video games, noting his influential work in the Souls series that has gone on to influence other game designers.

The group's posted mission is \\"...to provide outstanding networking and educational opportunities for professionals who serve and participate in executive doctoral degree programs.\\" The group states on its website that it is the only global organization of its kind. History The EDBAC was founded in 2011 to promote the DBA degree as a business or executive qualification, rather than an academic qualification, such as a PhD. The group held its first meeting at Case Western Reserve University in June 2011. DBA versus PhD The DBA and PhD both focus on developing an individual's research skills, but the PhD is designed to prepare individuals for academic careers. The DBA is intended to prepare students for a research career in business. An executive qualification such as a DBA is also called a practitioner degree. Membership The EDBAC offers membership to accredited, not-for-profit public or private institutions of higher learning that offer a doctoral program for executives or are considering doing so. As of January 2016, there were 48 member schools, including University of Maryland University College, Benedictine University, Case Western Reserve University, City University of Hong Kong, Copenhagen Business School, Cranfield University, ESC Rennes School of Business, Georgia State University, Manchester University, Oklahoma State University, Paris Dauphine University, Rollins College, Temple University, University of Florida and University of Reading. Organization structure The EDBAC has a board consisting of a chairperson and ten other members, of which two are program alumni. Emma Parry of Cranfield University, is the current chairperson. Events The Executive DBA Council sponsors and organizes an Annual Engaged Management Scholarship (EMS) Conference where current students and alumni of member programs present peer-reviewed research. The sixth annual conference was held in Paris, France in September 2016. The 2017 conference was scheduled for Tampa, Florida in September 2017 but was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. The 2018 conference is scheduled to take place at Temple University September 6-9 2018.

It was released on May 26, 2015 and was announced at Sony's E3 2014 media briefing with a trailer. Instead of being developed by Arrowhead Game Studios, the title was developed by Pieces Interactive alongside the publisher Paradox Interactive. Plot =Opening= The opening of Magicka 2 starts with a backstory, how 1 through 4 wizards from the Order of Magick saved Midgard from certain doom multiple times (the story of Magicka). Due to this success, the Order of Magick decided to expand by founding multiple wizard schools all over Midgard. However, conflict between the schools grew, eventually sparking the Wizard Wars. The aftermath of the wars resulted in many wizards decimated, and those who survived tread the shadows of their former glory. Without wizards destroying the human's way of life, the Golden Age of Man has begun. During this period of calmness, a seer named Nostrir the Soothslayer has prophesied that a child, infused with magick from the magickal residue caused by the Wizard Wars, was born somewhere in Midgard. This very child, once of age, will lead Midgard into a better place, free of suffering. However, the prophesy also told that an opposing force would seek to prevent the child from realizing her power. Vlad, back from his multi-decade vacation, returns to Aldrheim only to find the castle in ruins. Hearing Nostrir's prophesy, Vlad decides to guide 1 through 4 wizards from the ruins of Aldrheim to save the prophesied child. =Main Story= After being treated to a brief tutorial the 1-4 players are instructed by Vlad to find the seer Nostrir and set out towards Crystal Bay, where Nostrir resides. On the way, the player passes through a group of humans celebrating a festival called ‚ÄúInterdependence Day‚Äù. The festival grounds are attacked by goblins which the player defeats. After arriving in Crystal Bay, Vlad informs the players of Nostrirs last known residence. The wizards make their way towards Nostrirs house while fighting of hordes of Goblins and vicious, man-eating crabs. When the wizards arrive at Nostrirs house it is discovered that a group of goblins and orcs are also searching for him but that he no longer resides in his house. After defeating the leaders of the orc and goblin raid, Vlad appears and instructs the wizards to search the caves beneath Crystal Bay for Nostrir. Venturing through the caves the players discover an underground fortress where Nostrir now resides. After defeating a giant horde of enemy crabs the wizards are allowed entrance and meets Nostrir. Vlad teleports in and asks him where the prophesied child may be found, Nostrir reveals that the child was born in the Vanir higherlands in the clan of chieftess Frida. Before Nostrir can fully reveal who the child is, however, a giant claw appears from a nearby underground lake and pulls him in. Vlad tells the players to venture north into the Vanir Higerlands anyway and find the child. Continuing to venture through the caves the wizards encounter the Beastkin, a group of aggressive, vegan half human- half animal creatures, and has to fight through them to reach the Higherlands. After exiting through a passageway that leads to the Higherlands the wizards discover a massive army of orcs and goblins presumably heading north to stop the child from realising its power. The wizards make haste having to fight through beastkin, orcs and goblins alike. The wizards then reach a bridge leading into the Vanir‚Äôs territory, a group of beastkin demand entry into the land as their lands are being destroyed by elves and humans. The Vanir deny them entry and in the ensuing fight the wizards emerge victorious. After finding the chieftess Frida Vlad mediates between the Vanir, who wants to kill the wizards for killing their bridge keepers in the aforementioned fight, and the wizards who wish to find the child. Frida realises that the prophesied child may be her own daughter, Lok. The wizards continue to head north towards the Vanir village where Lok resides, arriving at the same time as the orcs, under the leadership of the warlady Khan IV the first, and the goblins under the leadership of the shaman Metexas. The wizards manage to defeat warlady Khan with their magic causing the orcs to scatter. After the battle Lok‚Äôs mentor, Elin, wants to kill the wizards, citing the fact wizards can never be trusted and cause more harm than good. Lok refuses and instead traps the wizards inside a magical crystal ball, also trapping the nearby Metexas in the process. After being trapped inside the crystal ball Metexas berates the wizards for trusting in Vlad and Nostrir and presents an alternative version of the prophecy where it is the child who endangers the world with her powers. This prophecy is the reason for the orcs and goblins unifying, as they wished to stop the child before it causes to much damage. One year after being imprisoned the wizards and Metexas are freed by Vlad, who briefs them on what has happened during their year of imprisonment where it appears Metexas‚Äô predictions are coming true as the Vanir have since pushed southwards under Lok‚Äôs leadership and have united humans, elves and dwarves in an alliance under the Vanir. A disgruntled Metexas teleports away and Vlad tasks the wizards with stopping Lok before it‚Äôs too late. The wizards then head through the forest towards castle Vanirhall, Lok‚Äôs base of operations built atop the ruins of Aldrheim. After encountering a group of elves Vlad teleports in front of the wizards to give them another briefing, accidentally blowing their cover and leading to the wizards having to fight their way to Vanirhall. After arriving to Vanirhall the wizards defeat most of the castles guards before encountering Elin, whom they defeat. The wizards confront Lok, who is initially excited to see them thinking they are still mostly harmless. After sensing that the wizards have killed Elin, she attacks them using a golem she has constructed with her magic. The wizards managed to incapacitate the golem by destroying its magical power reserves and Vlad then appears and uses his magic to trap Lok. After looking around the castle Vlad states that it would make a good new magic school and then teleports away after declaring himself the headmaster. The wizards celebrate their victory before the golem initiates a self-destruct sequence, the screen promptly cuts to black. Reception Magicka 2 received mixed reviews from critics upon release. On Metacritic, the game holds score of 69/100 for the PC version based on 37 reviews, and 72/100 based on 18 reviews for the PlayStation 4 version. IGN awarded the game a score of 7.7 out of 10, saying \\"Though it may occasionally test your patience, Magicka 2's charm and depth make it a really fun co-op experience\\". PCGamesN awarded it 6 out of 10, saying \\" At the moment it‚Äôs functional, sometimes fun, but only something that should really be considered if you‚Äôve got three chums who are guaranteed to play with you.\\". GameSpot awarded it 7 out of 10, saying \\"Put Magicka 2 next to its 2011 predecessor and you‚Äôve got a before-and-after comparison straight out of a weight-loss advertising campaign.\\" WGRank 6.2 out of 10 based on Good points: Skill based magic - co-operative - good combat system and Bad points: Some bug need to solve - difficult to point when doing solo.

Playing career =Provincial= Linee made his debut for Western Province in 1992 and played 112 games for the province until his retirement in 2001. Renowned as a hard-hitting centre, he was a regular starter in the midfield for Western Province. In 2001, future Springbok captain Jean de Villiers made his Western Province debut alongside Tinus Linee. On 14 October 1995 Linee played in his first Currie Cup final, against the at Kings Park Stadium in Durban. Linee played alongside Springbok and Western Province legends such as Pieter Rossouw, Chester Williams, Justin Swart, Joel Stransky and Tiaan Strauss as well as French legend Laurent Cabannes.

He made his debut for the Springboks in a tour match against the Victoria national rugby union team in Melbourne on 21 July 1993. At the time, Heinrich F√ºls and Pieter Muller were the preferred centres for the test matches, so Linee played only in tour games and failed to make the team for the test matches. In 1994 Linee again made the Springbok squad for both the Argentinean tour to South Africa as well as the Springbok tour to , and . He again did not feature in any of the test matches and on 22 November 1994, he played his last tour match for the Springboks against Pontypridd in Pontypridd, Wales.

It was released on 14 April 2015.  Plot  Between Earth and the real world beyond lie the Titan Souls, the spiritual source and sum of all living things. Now scattered amongst the ruins and guarded by the idle titans charged with their care, a solitary hero armed with but a single arrow is once again assembling shards of the Titan Soul in a quest for truth and power.  Gameplay  Titan Souls is a strategic, open world, 2D, top-down action-adventure, where the player has only one arrow and can only take one hit. The goal is to defeat the nineteen giant monsters called the Titans, which can, just like the player, only take one hit but only have one way to be defeated. During the fight, the player has to figure out how the respective boss behaves and by that find a way to defeat that boss. The difficulty is that the single arrow has to be charged to be shot and afterwards has to be retrieved to be reused, each action only able to be done while the player is standing still, making them an easy target for the bosses.  Development  Titan Souls draws inspiration from influences such as Dark Souls, Shadow of the Colossus and The Legend of Zelda. The game was originally created for the Ludum Dare Game Jam #28 as TITAN SOULS, uploaded under the username Claw. The game placed first in the categories \\"Overall (Jam)\\", \\"Audio (Jam)\\" and \\"Mood (Jam)\\". Over the course of six months, the game was ported from Adobe Flash to its new engine, enhancing graphics and improving performance, adding a new soundtrack and expanding the game from three to sixteen titans. In June 2014, Titan Souls was shown at E3 2014, revealing that the game will be published by Devolver Digital. After E3, the game was expanded further with three additional titans and a story. On 25 March 2015, Devolver Digital revealed that Titan Souls will be released on 14 April 2015. On 2 April 2015, the Game Jam prototype was remade in the new engine, adding better graphics, an improved soundtrack and new bosses, and a demo was made available before the full game release. The game was ported to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita by Abstraction Games. The game was released on 14 April 2015. Abstraction Games later announced that an Android port was also underway, which released 30 June 2015.  Reception  Titan Souls received positive reviews. It received a score of 74/100 on Metacritic. Tim Turi from Game Informer gave the game an 8.5/10, praising the simple control, as well as the huge variety of bosses featured, high replay value, as well as the attractive and captivating atmosphere and environmental-design and the extra challenges for extending the longevity of the game. The inspiring boss- design is also praised. He also praised the music featured in the game, calling it \\"a clever contrast to the pulse-pounding boss tunes\\" However, he noted that patience is needed in enjoying the game because the player will die very often in a playthrough. He summarized the review by calling a top down game with \\"Zelda-style battles against a large gallery of tough bosses in the vein of Shadow of the Colossus.\\" Tom Orry from VideoGamer.com gave the game an 8/10, praising the game's artistic visuals, challenging and quality boss battles, rewarding gameplay, as well as the game's emphasis on skill. However, he noted that the game can be frustrating to play and that the limited world and exploration and the lack of an instant respawn option has dragged the game down. He summarized the review by calling the game \\"a unique and memorable experience\\" and stated that the game is one of the most interesting titles he has played in 2015. Brandin Tyrrel from IGN gave the game an 8/10, while praising the game's checkpoint system, which saves the game from being tedious, as well as the endearing 16-bit art-style, responsive control and creative boss battles, he criticized the game for having generic and boring environmental design and for lacking randomization, which lowers the replay value. Arthur Gies from Polygon is much more negative about the game, calling the boss-fights anti-climactic, as well as criticizing the game's empty world, \\"gibberish\\" boss description, basic puzzles and the control for being overly- simplistic. He also criticized the game boss battles for encouraging a repetitive pattern in defeating bosses.

History Little Buffalo Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179489. A gristmill and a sawmill were built on Little Buffalo Creek during the winter of 1774 to 1775. The Hubbler Bridge, which is also known as the Lewisburg Penitentiary Bridge, is located on Little Buffalo Creek west of Lewisburg. It is on private property. A bridge built over the creek in 1850 was used as a route for transporting grain to Campbell's Mill. A bridge carrying T-404 over Little Buffalo Creek was built before 1977. It is west of New Columbia and is long. A bridge carrying State Route 1003 was built over the creek north of Kelly Cross Roads in 1934. This bridge is long and was repaired in 1983. Another bridge carrying that road was built over the creek north of Kelly Cross Roads in 1936 and is long. A two-span bridge was built across the creek south of Kelly Cross Roads in 1949, was repaired in 2002, and is long. In 1950, a bridge carrying State Route 1004 was constructed over the creek in Kelly Cross Roads and is long. In 1951, a bridge carrying State Route 1006 was built over Little Buffalo Creek in northeast of Kelly Cross Roads and is long. A bridge with a length of was built across Little Buffalo Creek in 1985 and carries State Route 1003 west of Kelly Point. A bridge with a length of was built over the creek in 1991 and carries T-391 east of Kelly Point. In the 2008 report, the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek was ranked fourth amongst several sub- watersheds in the Buffalo Creek drainage basin for restoration priority. In 2014, the a $329,851 grant from the Growing Greener program was issued to the Union County Conservation District for agricultural best management practices in the creek's watershed. Biology The drainage basin of Little Buffalo Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce on a reach of the creek from the T442 bridge downstream to the second State Route 1006 bridge. This reach is long. A group of spawning white suckers were observed in the creek in the 1920s. A population of American eels was released into Little Buffalo Creek in 2013. The eels also carried with them the larvae of freshwater mussels. The aim of the project was to restore American eels and freshwater mussels to the ecosystem of the Susquehanna River. In a 2008 study, Little Buffalo Creek was found to be less biologically impaired than expected given the amount of agricultural activity and livestock in its watershed. Additionally, some wetlands have been created along the creek by landowners to serve as waterfowl habitats and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program of the United States Department of Agriculture has installed riparian buffers on the creek in some formerly agricultural land.

Initially released as a digital title in August 2016, a retail version for consoles was released in January 2017. Following the journey of a diver exploring the ocean and restoring life using sonar calls, the gameplay allows the player to freely navigate underwater environments ranging from open water and natural caverns to ancient ruins. Development lasted three years, involving a team of thirteen people. Several members, including director Matt Nava and composer Austin Wintory, had previously worked on the 2012 video game Journey‚Äîthe ocean setting of Abz√ª was both a reaction to the desert setting of Journey and inspired by Nava's love of scuba diving. The setting and story drew from Sumerian mythology and the cosmic ocean myth. Reaching high positions in sales charts, Abz√ª was praised by journalists: the majority of praise went to its art style, with some critics comparing it to Journey. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing the playable character underwater In Abz√ª, the player takes on the role of a diver in a vast ocean‚Äîafter waking up floating on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the diver to find. Synopsis The narrative of Abz√ª is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, taking place in a vast ocean. The player character, referred to as a female diver, awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a great white shark to wells that‚Äîwhen activated using an energy from within her‚Äîrestore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices called Harvesters, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original Harvester known as the Great Harvester, the diver sees the great white shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver‚Äîrevealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean‚Äîand mortally wounds the great white shark, which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, the great white shark manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the Great Harvester which the diver destroys, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and great white shark swim together through the revitalized ocean. Development The origins of Abz√ª lay in the development of Journey, an independent video game developed by Thatgamecompany and released in 2012. Abz√ªs creator, director and art director Matt Nava had previously worked as art director for Journey during its three-year development. Having worked in a game featuring a desert setting, Nava wanted to change to a more vibrant and populated setting for his next title. Nava began creating the pitch for Abz√ª before leaving Thatgamecompany and founding the game's developer Giant Squid Studios. One of the main elements Nava incorporated was his love for ancient cultures and their artwork, particularly relating to the myths surrounding the concept of Abzu. Nava's love of the ocean, which he explored through his hobby of scuba diving, also figured heavily in the design of Abz√ª. The team at Giant Squid Studios grew to ten developers from across the industry, mainly programmers who specialized in multiple aspects of game design from gameplay to graphics, in addition to a graphical and technical artist who helped create and animate the character models. The game was first announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was later previewed at E3 2016. The game's initial digital release was on PlayStation 4 via PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows through Steam on August 2, 2016. Later it was also released digitally on Xbox One through Xbox Live on December 6, 2016 and on Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo eShop on November 29, 2018. It was released in Japan on February 27, 2020. The game also received a physical release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 31, 2017. All versions were published by 505 Games. =Design= The game's title stems from Sumerian mythology, particularly the myth of the ocean goddess Tiamat and the fresh water god Abzu uniting to form all life: a reason this was chosen was that myths surrounding land-based life and their supposed origins in a cosmic ocean were a recurring theme in multiple world mythologies. The title is made up of the words \\"Ab\\" (water) and \\"Z√ª\\" (to know), translated by the developers as \\"Ocean of Wisdom\\". The word provided difficulties early on, as the Sumerian spelling \\"Abzu\\" differed from the Akkadian spelling \\"Aps√ª\\". As a compromise, the team merged the two spellings into the game's title. The circumflex over the letter \\"u\\" caused problems for the team as hardly anyone knew how to type it and the computer programs had trouble handling it as part of the coding. The use of the word played into the game's focus on the ocean due to its mythic connections. The Middle Eastern influences extended to the game's architecture, and incorporated Nava's wish for structures to have meaning beyond being simple scenery or tools for player progression. The aim from an early stage was not to simulate diving, but instead to capture the dream-like feeling of ocean exploration. As part of his research, Nava experimented with other ocean simulation games and found they were not \\"fun\\". By removing any time limit or air gauge, the team sought to promote a relaxing sense of exploration. One of the main issues was giving the player complete freedom to swim around, including doing a full loop‚Äîthis effect was normally held back due to camera difficulties, but Giant Squid managed to resolve the issue and allow for greater range of movement. The meditation mechanic was added during later development from 2015 to 2016 as a means of allowing players a view of the surrounding marine life and environment. When choosing their game engine, Matt Nava was still the only staff member and so they needed an easy-to-use platform with tools and technology to create his vision. Unreal Engine 4 was still quite new at this time, but it was chosen after the team had vetted other developer software available at the time. The team were able to use both Unreal Engine 4's advanced developer tools and expand the engine's functionality to incorporate unique elements such as fish shoal behavior, vegetation animation, and underwater lighting. Using Unreal Engine 4 allowed engineer Derek Cornish to construct unique systems for underwater lighting effects. The artistic style was meant to portray a vibrant underwater world, but the team also needed to prevent activity on-screen from overwhelming the player, so a stylized look was chosen to both maintain the game's artistic style and reduce the amount of \\"visual noise\\". Environmental editing was a big issue for the team, with much of their early development dedicated to creating editing tools that could do small-scale edits to environments after they had been locked down. When creating the environments, Nava drew on his experience developing Flower for Thatgamecompany, creating sporadically scattered interaction points that triggered with player exploration and triggered new life or new elements within each environment. Since there was no dedicated animator, the team needed to use multiple techniques for animating the diver, fish and flexible vegetation: the diver used a skeletal animation run through a complex state machine, vegetation such as seaweed used rope physics, while fish mainly used mathematical motion in combination with morph target posing to remove the need of individual skeletal structures. The types of fish seen in Abz√ª were based on real-life creatures from the oceans of Earth, and to fit them into the game each species was distilled down to its most distinctive traits. The team had \\"tens of thousands\\" of fish within the game. Their swimming styles were directly modeled on the behavior and physics of real fish movements. The number of fish presented problems with running the game, but the programming staff developed a method of simplifying each fish's animation without compromising the game's visuals, which \\"multiplied the number of fish possible on screens by 10\\". Each fish species had its own unique artificial intelligence that had cascading levels of awareness and interaction with other species and objects in the environment. The team started with getting the fish to swim without clipping through walls, then built upon that with further expansion on fish behavior and interaction. Their most challenging task was creating realistic bait balling effects for shoals of small fish, which was only achieved and finalized near the end of development. The developers did take liberties by grouping together types of fish from different parts of the globe which would normally not be able to interact, though this fell in line with the game's overall theme and the myths it referenced. Despite this, the developers emulated the zones that each fish would be found in, whether it be a coral reef or the deep ocean where sunlight does not reach. The amount of work and the team's dedication to creating a realistic and vibrant experience meant they were creating fish until development finished. =Music= The soundtrack for Abz√ª was composed, conducted, and produced by Austin Wintory, who had previously worked on Journey and The Banner Saga. Wintory was first shown concept art for the project by Nava before Giant Squid Studios was founded and development began. When the studio was founded, Wintory was invited on board the project. The music was written from the start to be interactive and dynamic rather than based on specific cues. To achieve this, Wintory had to play the game extensively and repeatedly to get a sense for what players would experience and what would best match the mood. Similar to Wintory's work on Journey, the first track written was the main theme \\"To Know, Water\\" and further tracks were created over the game's three year development based on that theme. The score's instrumental element began with using a harp as its base, with a choir being used later. More instrumentation was needed, with a full orchestra eventually being incorporated. As with his work on Journey and Assassin's Creed Syndicate, he used a soloist alongside an ensemble orchestra: in this case, the solo instrument was an oboe. The oboe solos were performed by Kristin Naigus, whom Wintory had heard performing a cover of a track from Journey on YouTube. Wintory worked closely with Abz√ªs sound designer Steve Green created a music-based story that flowed alongside and worked with the visual narrative of Abz√ª. The official soundtrack was released as a digital album through Bandcamp and iTunes on August 2, 2016. A physical edition was released on October 22 through Var√®se Sarabande. Music reviewers were generally positive about the soundtrack album. The soundtrack later won the 2017 Game Audio Network Guild's \\"Best Original Soundtrack Album\\" award. The soundtrack was also nominated at the 2017 BAFTA Games Awards in the \\"Music\\" category, but lost to Virginia. For his work on Abz√ª, Wintory won the 2016 International Film Music Critics Association award for \\"Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media\\", making his second win in a row. The score was also nominated at the Hollywood Music in Media Awards in the \\"Original Score ‚Äì Video Game\\" category. Reviewers of the game also gave unanimous praise to the soundtrack, positively comparing it to that of Journey. Reception In its debut week on Steam, the game reached #9 in platform sales charts. Abz√ª was at #18 among the best-selling titles on PlayStation Store's PS4 charts for August, being the third best-selling new title that month behind Batman: The Telltale Series (#7) and No Man's Sky (#1). The PS4 and PC versions received scores of 78 and 83 on aggregate site Metacritic based on 19 and 72 reviews respectively, each denoting \\"generally favorable\\" reception. Abz√ª was nominated at The Game Awards 2016 in the \\"Best Art Direction\\" category; at the Golden Joystick Awards in the \\"Best Original Game\\", \\"Best Visual Design\\" and \\"PlayStation Game of the Year\\" categories; and at the 2017 BAFTA Games Awards in the \\"Artistic Achievement\\" category. Martin Gaston of Eurogamer called it \\"a mechanically simple game, but a pleasurable one\\"‚Äîwhile finding early sections barren and the camera awkward at times, he enjoyed the gameplay's simplicity. Scott Butterworth of GameSpot found the gameplay lacking in variety, but otherwise praised the game's immersive qualities. Justin McElroy of Polygon felt that the gameplay, while generally enjoyable, was undermined by a lack of player interaction. Zack Furniss of Destructoid found swimming easy and enjoyable despite simplistic controls, and found that the experience benefited from its short length. Matthew Kato of Game Informer found the lack of interaction was balanced out by the sheer spectacle of environments and swimming with marine life. Jose Otero of IGN enjoyed the continued rewards of exploration despite its minimal amount of gameplay mechanics, while James Davenport of PCGamer enjoyed both the exploration and the ability to meditate and observe the environment. Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com enjoyed the gameplay but disliked its lack of seamless environments, and David Roberts of GamesRadar felt that the game's biggest strength was its simplicity when compared to other titles on the market at the time. The visuals and environments were generally praised for their artistic style and beautiful environments, with many citing the graphics as one of the game's main strengths; Butterworth positively compared the graphics to the cel-shaded style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Otero called the game's art direction \\"fantastic\\" and praised the consistent framerate, while Orry praised the art style and graphics despite the simplistic models making Abz√ª appear \\"basic looking\\". Reactions to the story were generally positive, with many critics calling it an emotive experience, with many noting its narrative as being mostly open to interpretation: Kato compared the game's themes to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some reviewers were less positive: Furniss felt that Abz√ªs story was not as grand as its developers touted, while Davenport found it overly familiar to the point of being cliche. Multiple reviewers favorably compared the artistic style and gameplay experience to Journey and the previous work of Thatgamecompany. Roberts in particular noted that some players might find it too similar to the likes of Journey.

Previously considered as a subspecies (Upupa epops africana) of the hoopoe, due to its vocalisations and small differences in plumage, it is otherwise similar to that species. Even with the controversy, the African Hoopoe is not an overwhelmingly studied bird and more research should be done.  Description  = Size = The African Hoopoe has the average size of 25 to 29 cm, with a wingspan between 44 to 48 cm. The weight is between 38 to 67 g when fully grown. This is about the size of the average robin. = Coloring = African Hoopoes have a crown also called a crest which is usually chestnut colored with black on the tips. This crown will raise when the bird has been startled or disturbed, especially when eating. No eyerings or eye-stripes are present, but the bill is long, dark and narrow and slightly down curved. These birds do exhibit sexual dimorphism, therefore the male and female are different colors. The male is typically fully chestnut colored, whereas the female has a grayer body. Both males and females have black and white stripes on their wings and tail which are rounded. This black and white striped pattern leads to a V-formation on their backs. The juveniles are colored similarly to females except they have shorter beaks. You‚Äôll notice in adults, the beaks are about the same size of the head. = Flight = When these birds are in flight, they flap between 4 to 5 beats, then pause in which their body drops, and then continue to beat their wings 4 to 5 times. When in the air, you‚Äôll notice the same black and white striping on the wings and tail on their underside as when they are perched. = Other = Not much research has been done on the African Hoopoe, but they seem to have similar habits to the Eurasian Hoopoe, besides them living in completely different ecological niches. Their biggest threats predatorily are raptor species which include hawks and eagles.  Taxonomy  The African Hoopoe, Upupa africana is part of the genus Upupa, which includes all Hoopoes. This particular species is interesting, because taxonomists are debating whether this is a subspecies of the Eurasian Hoopoe, Upupa epops or its own species. In 1811, Bechstein named it as Upupa epops africana. The speciation of these birds, leading to confusion may have occurred because the Eurasian Hoopoe migrates, usually from Europe to Northern Africa but is known to migrate further south in Africa. The birds that migrated further may have just decided to stay in Southern Africa, leading to a subspecies or possibly a whole new species known as Upupa africana. Some taxonomists still consider all three species conspecific. Some authorities also keep the African and Eurasian hoopoe together, but split the Madagascar hoopoe. The species was described by the German naturalist Johann Matth√§us Bechstein under the current binomial name Upupa africana. Other members of the genus Upupa include: * Eurasian Hoopoe, Upupa epops * Madagascar Hoopoe, Upupa marginata * St. Helena Hoopoe, Upupa antaios  Habitat & Distribution  = Distribution = The African Hoopoe is widely distributed throughout South Africa, as well as from Central Democratic Republic of Congo to Central Kenya and all the way south of the Cape of South Africa. They have even been recorded as far north as Sudan. A list of countries where the African Hoopoe has been seen is as follows: South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and the southern half of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Therefore they are considered to be of least concern according to the IUCN red list. Although they are of least concern, populations are decreasing and Common Starlings have begun outcompeting them for nesting sites in urban areas. Interestingly, even though the Eurasian Hoopoe migrates, African Hoopoes do not migrate although some may travel short distances within South Africa and other Southern African countries. = Habitat = The African Hoopoe prefers open and bushy areas, including thornveld, a landscape with mostly thorny bush and trees, and riverine woodlands in dry areas. It inhabits broadleaf forests and savannah.  Behavior  = Vocalizations = The African Hoopoes most common call is easy to remember because it sounds like its name: ‚ÄúHoo-poo‚Äù. This will be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times with a break and then continued with the same pattern. This call is only made by males and is usually used during mating season. Besides the most common ‚ÄúHoo-poo‚Äù call, the male will also produce a ‚Äúswizzling‚Äù sound: ‚Äúswizzle-swizzle-swizzle‚Äù. Both of these calls are in mating season. When not in mating season, these birds are more silent but still have some sounds such as the ‚Äúrattle‚Äù and ‚Äúhuk‚Äù. These sounds are used more often when the bird has been disturbed and is used by both the males and females. Lastly, a sound: ‚Äúchoorie, choorie, choorie‚Äù is used by males when he gives food to the female during the mating season. Again this is only done by the male. = Diet = African Hoopoes eat mainly insects. These include Coleoptera, which are beetles, Dermaptera (earwigs) and Orthoptera, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets according to a study done by Kopij. Besides these, small reptiles have been found to be fed to chicks as well as worms, slugs, and small snakes. Small seeds and berries may even be eaten. To find the insects, the African Hoopoe uses its long beak to penetrate the soil and then may whack the insect or prey onto the ground to break it up into smaller pieces. They prefer to do this in shorter grass. Unlike the rest of the year, African Hoopoes maintain a specific territory throughout the breeding season in which they feed. = Reproduction =  Overview  The mating season begins in mid April where the male seeks out a female, where he will ‚Äòbribe‚Äô her with little bits of food. Once the mate is found, breeding occurs later in August. Once mating has begun, the incubation periods last between 14 to 16 days in which the female incubates the eggs. Once the chicks have hatched they will spend between 26-32 days in which they will be fed mostly by the male until closer to their fledging date when the female and male share the responsibilities. The breeding season then ends in December. These birds are monogamous so each bird only mates with one other African Hoopoe.  Nesting  The African Hoopoe doesn‚Äôt make its own nest but rather finds holes that are just slightly larger than their bodies to nest. It seems possible that the nests are chosen by males but haven't been studied efficiently enough. The nests are also usually found from the ground to a maximum of about eight meters above the ground.  Clutch Size  These birds are double brooded, meaning they may have two sets of chicks per year. Within these broods, 4 to 7 eggs will be laid which are smooth when freshly laid but become rougher. They are also blue-green when laid compared to a faded color after laying. Interestingly, another bird, the Greater Honeyguide may actually use the nests of African Hoopoes to lay their own eggs making them brood parasites.

Until 2005 he was a research advisor and senior economist in the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and editor of the Bank's flagship publication, the Economic Quarterly. His publications cover macroeconomics, monetary economics, and the history of economic thought. Mark Blaug called him the \\"undisputed master\\" of British classical monetary thought. Writing and research Humphrey has written books and journal articles on monetary policy history. He is the author of articles published in journals such as the Cato Journal, HOPE (History of Political Economy), Southern Economics Journal,Southern Economics Journal. 41 (July 1974), 58 and Econ Focus (formerly Region Focus). He wrote over 70 articles published in the journals of the Richmond Federal Reserve. Articles by Humphrey such as Rival Notions of Money Humphrey, Thomas M.

Humphrey was an editor of the Federal Reserve of Richmond Economic Quarterly, previously known as the Economic Review and before that as the Monthly Review. In 1998 his annual report for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was Mercantilists and Capitalists: Insights from Doctrinal History. His first four books on the history of monetary thought were: The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments, Exchange Rates, and World Inflation (co-author Robert Keleher); Money, Banking and Inflation: Essays in the History of Monetary Thought; Money, Exchange and Production: Further Essays in the History of Economic Thought; and Essays on Inflation. Charles R. McCann, Jr. stated, in reference to Humphrey's book Money, Banking and Inflation: Essays in the History of Monetary Thought that \\"monetary economists looking for an accessible introduction to their discipline's past will find few better starting points than this volume.\\" In 2019 The Cato Institute published his fifth book, Gold, the Real Bills Doctrine, and the Fed: Sources of Monetary Disorder--1922-1938, a collaboration between Humphrey and his co-author Richard H. Timberlake. His writing on the history of economic thought was included in the first edition to the New Palgrave and in the later An Encyclopedia of Keynesian Economics to which he contributed an article on the Chicago School of Economics, and also in festschriften, book reviews, textbooks, annual reports, and anthologies. For Famous Figures in Diagrams and Economics by Mark Blaug and Peter Lloyd, Humphrey wrote the first chapter, Marshallian Cross Diagrams and Chapter 55, Intertemporal utility maximization ‚Äì the Fisher diagram. Humphrey's works on monetary theory are cited in David Laidler's book Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution: Studies of the Inter-War Literature on Money, the Cycle, and Unemployment. In 2006, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at the Fourth ECB Central Banking Conference, Frankfurt, Germany, cited Humphrey's article on the real bills doctrine. In 2008 Humphrey gave the Fourth Annual Ranlett Lecture in Economics at California State University, Sacramento, entitled Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History. In 2009 Humphrey participated in the Adam Smith Program, Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond, where he presented The Fed's Deviation from Classical Thornton-Bagehot Lender- of-Last-Resort Policy, a paper co-authored with Richard Timberlake. At the 2010 Annual Meeting of the American Economics Association (AEA) in Atlanta, Georgia, his subject was The Lender of Last Resort in the History of Economic Thought.

In 2007 changes to Liquor Licensing Regulations in Western Australia opened up the opportunities for small bars. This was followed in August 2008 by the City of Perth formally adopting a laneways enhancement strategy, \\"Forgotten Spaces ‚Äì Revitalising Perth's Laneways\\". Shafto Lane Shafto Lane links Hay and Murray Streets. It was originally two lanes, Chipper Lane from Hay Street to Murray Street and Barratt Lane from Murray Street to Wellington Street. Chipper Lane was originally the internal laneway for the Chipper property. On 10 June 1889, Donald J Chipper established an undertaker, coachbuilder & wheelwright business at the Murray Street end and two retail shops were at the Hay Street end. In between, were stables and workshops. In 1898, Chipper ceased coachbuilding and wheelwrighting and moved the funeral home to the Hay Street end. Barratt Lane, named after Enoch Pearson Barratt, a convict who established Western Australia's first nursery. Barratt owned land on Murray Street, which ran through to Wellington Street. He was also employed as the gardener for the Government Gardens, now known as Stirling Gardens. In December 1929 the City of Perth resolved to rename Barratt Lane to Shafto Lane. The renaming recognised Thomas Alfred Shafto, who was a City of Perth councillor for twelve years, a failed mayoral candidate and owner of the Shaftsbury Hotel and Shaftsbury Theatre. Wolf Lane In 2001 the Perth City Council identified the potential for the redevelopment of Wolf Lane into a secondary and distinctive retail area within the King Street precinct. The Council spent $315,000 upgrading Wolf Lane. Wolf Lane includes small bars: Wolfe Lane Bar, Cheeky Sparrow and hairdresser Toni & Guy. In 2014 FORM, a Western Australian art consultancy, staged a public art festival, which produced a number of large-scale urban artworks developed by International and Australian urban artists. Works in Wolf Lane included those by Maya Hyuk (New York, US), Alexis Diaz (Puerto Rico, US), Hyuro (Argentina), Luke Cornish aka E.L.K. (Canberra, AUS), ROA (Belgium) and Hurben (Perth, Western Australia). Howard Lane Howard Lane is a U-shaped laneway that runs parallel to and west of Howard Street, between St Georges Terrace to the north and The Esplanade to the south. Access to the lane is off Howard Street. Howard Lane was upgraded by the City of Perth in 2009, and features a series of artworks commissioned by Stormie Mills and Yok. In May 2010, the Council received the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (WA Chapter) Award in Design for the Howard Lane Upgrade. Howard Lane includes two small bars, Andaluz and Helvetica. Prince Lane Prince Lane connects Wellington and Murray Streets, parallel to and west of King Street. It was upgraded by the City of Perth in 2012-13 for $800,000 (AUS). The upgrading included new gutters, granite kerbs, lighting and a series of artworks along the length of the laneway, commissioned from well-known Western Australian artists: Clare McFarlane; Denise Brown; Stephen Genovese; Jae Criddle; Paul Caporn and Leanne Bray and Stormie Mills. Grand Lane Grand Lane runs between Murray Street Mall (north side), near the junction with Barrack Street, almost through to Wellington Street where it branches east to Barrack Street. The name of the lane relates to the former Grand Theatre, which used to occupy a prominent site on the south-western side of the laneway. It was upgraded by the City of Perth in 2011 for $500,000 (AUS), the works include a 99-metre mural on the western wall by Victorian artists Bonsai and Twoone, an artwork on the eastern wall by Timothy Rollin, and a mural by Chris Nixon. At the north end of the laneway is Foodchain's Light Locker Art Space, a peer-curated exhibition space for emerging Perth artists. Mercantile Lane Mercantile Lane links St Georges Terrace and Mounts Bay Road, adjacent to the Brookfield Place development. The name of the lane reflects that it abuts the former MLC building on St Georges Terrace. Munster Lane Munster Lane is a U-shaped laneway that runs parallel to and west of King Street, between Hay Street to the south and Murray Street to the north. Access to Munster Lane is from King Street. McLean Lane McLean Lane links Murray Street and Wellington Street, running between a multi-storey car park (Pier Street Car Park) and a former gasworks building (which is occupied by arts group, Artsource, as studio space). In 2009 the City of Perth sought to rename the lane, Gasworks Lane.

Five people died, including the two shooters. The couple, who espoused extreme anti-government views, first killed two Las Vegas police officers at a restaurant before fleeing into a Walmart, where they killed an intervening armed civilian. The couple died after engaging responding officers in a shootout; police shot and killed Jerad, while Amanda committed suicide after being wounded. Shootings On June 8, 2014, the Millers first went to a CiCi's Pizza restaurant on foot at 11:22 a.m., finding Las Vegas police officers Igor Soldo and Alyn Beck, who were eating at the restaurant on their lunch break. Prior to the shooting, they had observed the restaurant. Jerad Miller fatally shot Soldo in the side of the head with a handgun, then shot Beck in the throat, head and chest. Both Millers then fired at Soldo and Beck, shooting them multiple times after Beck had fallen to the ground. Afterwards, they covered Beck with a yellow Gadsden flag and a swastika. They pinned a note on Beck's body, which read: \\"This is the beginning of the revolution.\\" They also stole both officers' handguns and spare ammunition magazines. During the restaurant shooting, the Millers loudly declared to other patrons that it happened to be the start of \\"a revolution\\". The two then fled to a nearby Walmart, where Jerad fired a shot at the ceiling and ordered shoppers to leave. Joseph Wilcox drew his concealed 9mm Glock 19 and confronted Jerad, but passed Amanda as he did so, not realizing that she was armed and Jerad's accomplice; Amanda shot and killed Wilcox. Police (Officers Brett Brosnahan, Tim Gross, Zachery Beal, John Bethard, David Corbin, and Sergeant Kurt McKenzie) later responded to 9-1-1 calls and arrived at the Walmart, engaging the Millers in a gunfight (The police officers were able to locate the suspects and get information from Officers Troy Nicol and Ryan Fryman who were monitoring the CCTV of the Walmart), during which Amanda was wounded. The Millers moved toward the back of the store, where they tried to protect themselves from gunfire using several items from the store as a barricade. Police Officer Zachery Beal eventually shot and killed Jerad in the chest, while Amanda shot and critically wounded herself in the head. She was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where she died. Initial reports inaccurately indicated that Amanda shot Jerad repeatedly in the chest after he had \\"laid down\\" in front of her, killing him, before committing suicide. An investigation later recovered a 9mm Smith & Wesson M&P; handgun, a .38-caliber Ruger revolver, the two handguns stolen from Officers Soldo and Beck (a Glock 17 and H&K; USP 9mm, respectively), a Winchester 1300 shotgun, 200 rounds of ammunition, knives, and survival items from both Millers' backpacks. During a search at the Millers' apartment, papers that detailed plans to \\"take over a courthouse and execute public officials\\" were found. =Victims= *Officer Igor Soldo, 31 *Officer Alyn Beck, 41 *Joseph Robert Wilcox, 31 Perpetrators =Jerad Miller= Jerad Dwain Miller (January 3, 1983 ‚Äì June 8, 2014) was born in Kennewick, Washington. Jerad was arrested for multiple offenses in Washington and Indiana, starting in 2001. In 2007, he was sentenced to a diversion program after pleading guilty to a felony criminal recklessness charge. In 2009, he was arrested and charged with battery, but was acquitted later that year. In 2011, he was sentenced to two years of probation and drug counseling after pleading guilty to felony drug charges. That same year, Jerad met Amanda Woodruff, with whom he applied for a marriage license in Tippecanoe County, Indiana in August. They later married on September 22. Prior to the shooting, he worked as a street performer. In February 2014, Jerad threatened a Bureau of Motor Vehicles office in Indiana, claiming that he would start killing anyone who showed up to arrest him for having a suspended driver's license. He was described as often talking about conspiracy theories, dressing in camouflage, and espousing his hatred of the federal government and President Barack Obama. He was also a fan of the decentralized police accountability group Cop Block and would share online videos of police brutality, as well as posts of conspiracy theories and anti- government rhetoric. Prior to the shooting, Jerad had accounts on Facebook and YouTube, where he made ranting posts and videos. He once posted on June 2: One month prior to the shooting, Jerad asked several other Facebook users to send him \\"a rifle to help stand against tyranny\\". On the day prior to the shooting, Jerad posted a message on his account that forewarned the attack: =Amanda Miller= Amanda Miller (n√©e Woodruff; December 27, 1991 ‚Äì June 8, 2014) was born in Indiana. She did not have a criminal record preceding the shootings. In 2011, she met Jerad, with whom she applied for a marriage license in Tippecanoe County, Indiana in August 2012. They married on September 22. Like Jerad, she had a Facebook account, in which she made multiple posts, including numerous photos depicting the Millers dressed as supervillains. In one such photo, Amanda and Jerad were dressed up as Batman villains Harley Quinn and the Joker, respectively; according to a neighbor, the Millers particularly liked to dress up as the characters. In one of her Facebook posts, which was dated May 23, 2011, she wrote: On January 2014, the Millers moved from Lafayette, Indiana to Las Vegas, which Amanda recorded. =Presence at Bundy standoff= During the April 2014 Bundy standoff, in which the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) attempted to round up cattle belonging to rancher Cliven Bundy, who refused to vacate public land, Jerad was said to have been among the armed protesters who joined Bundy during the incident. According to Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, the Millers were present during the standoff for a few days, but had been instructed by a militia member to leave due to \\"their radical beliefs\\", which did not align with the protest's main issues. They were also instructed to leave because Jerad was a felon in possession of a firearm. Carol Bundy later commented, \\"I have not seen or heard anything from the militia and others who have came to our ranch that would, in any way, make me think they had an intent to kill or harm anyone.\\" During the standoff, Jerad had made interviews with other protesters at the ranch, and was also interviewed by CNN, NBC News affiliate KRNV-DT, and other news stations, during which he said: =Motives= Jerad posted several online videos in which he was dressed as the Joker. In one video, he expressed a strong hatred for law enforcement and police officers in general, warning in an online video that they \\"cannot be trusted\\". In another, he denounced the US government as being oppressive, especially criticizing their measures at gun control, surveillance, and their treatment of Cliven Bundy. Friends of the Millers reported that they idolized Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two perpetrators of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, and wanted to follow in their footsteps. The Millers' ideology about the government has been described as \\"along the lines of militia and white supremacists\\" by a police official. During the shooting, the Millers placed a swastika on the body of slain officer Alyn Beck and hung a Gadsden flag on the crime scene; police officials remarked that this act didn't signify the Millers were white supremacists, but instead was intended to associate police officers with Nazism. The Millers supported the Patriot movement, a collection of various groups with a shared ideology for limited federal government. According to Mark Potok, a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, there was no evidence that they belonged in a specific group, but that they considered the outcome of the standoff between Bundy and the BLM as \\"a huge victory against the federal government\\", which reportedly motivated them to commit the shooting spree. Reactions Interior Secretary Sally Jewell made a statement on the day following the shootings and commented about the Millers' presence on the Bundy ranch. She said, \\"It's very important to bring lawbreakers to justice. There's no question that my colleagues back here, the governors of Western states, do not want people riding roughshod over the landscape ... [Bundy] had put our people in grave danger by calling in armed citizens from around the country.\\" U.S. Senator Harry Reid, who had a staff member related to one of the victims, said, \\"All of Nevada mourns the tragic loss of our neighbors, our friends, and in the case of Officers Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo, our protectors\\" and called for universal background checks in the purchases of firearms. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman called the shootings \\"a cruel act\\" and also praised the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police for \\"dedicating their lives to protecting all of us in our community\\". Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval released a statement, saying that he was saddened by the murders and called the shootings \\"an act of senseless violence\\". CiCi's Pizza and Walmart also gave their condolences to the victims, with the latter also stating that it would cooperate with police during the investigation. Las Vegas Sheriff Doug Gillespie described Joseph Wilcox as a hero, saying, \\"Joseph died attempting to protect others. His death is completely senseless.\\" Wilcox's attempt at stopping Jerad Miller by using his concealed firearm also led to a debate over the necessity of concealed carry and its effectiveness during similar incidents. On social media, there has been some public praise by anti- government radicals for the killings of Soldo and Beck. As a result of aggressive anti-police posts on Facebook, there has been criticism of the site's lack of responsive action. Facebook commented through a spokesperson, \\"People come to Facebook to share experiences of the world around them and on occasion this may result in the sharing of content that some may find upsetting. We encourage anyone who sees content that violates our community standards to report it to us.\\" See also * List of right-wing terrorist attacks *2009 shootings of Oakland police officers *2009 Lakewood shooting *2016 shooting of Dallas police officers *2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers *2010 Las Vegas courthouse shooting *Christopher Dorner shootings and manhunt *2017 Las Vegas shooting References Category:2014 in Nevada Category:2014 murders in the United States Category:21st century in Las Vegas Category:American police officers killed in the line of duty Category:Anti- Federalism Category:Bundy standoff Category:Patriot movement Category:Sovereign citizen movement Category:Crimes in Nevada Category:Deaths by firearm in Nevada Category:June 2014 events in the United States Category:Murder in Nevada Category:Murder‚Äìsuicides in Nevada Category:Spree shootings in the United States Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States in 2014 Category:Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department ","title":"2014 Las Vegas shootings"},{"id":"43013494","text":"Amanda Miller may refer to: * Amanda Miller (cyclist), American professional road, MTB and cyclo-cross racer * Amanda Miller (choreographer), Eurovision Young Dancers 2001 jurist * Amanda Miller (ice dancer), juvenile ice dancer in the 2014 United States Figure Skating Championships * Amanda C.

Perry was a federal lawsuit challenging Texas marriage law, specifically the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and corresponding statutes. A U.S. district court ruled in favor of the plaintiff same-sex couples on February 26, 2014, granting their motion for a preliminary injunction. The state defendants filed an interlocutory appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, as the disposition on the motion was not a final ruling in the case. On April 14, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an expedited hearing, which was denied on May 21, 2014. The plaintiffs filed another motion for an expedited hearing on October 6, 2014, after the Supreme Court of the United States denied appeals in other marriage equality cases, and the motion was granted on October 7, 2014, setting a hearing for November 2014. However, on October 27, 2014, the Fifth Circuit set oral arguments for January 9, 2015. The Fifth Circuit heard oral argument on January 9, 2015. The case was still pending in the Fifth Circuit when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26, 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges that the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples is unconstitutional. On July 1, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Background Article I, Section 32 of the Constitution of Texas, added via referendum as Proposition 2 on November 8, 2005, specifically banned same-sex marriage by definition: \\"Marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman.\\" Plaintiffs in the case are Mark Phariss and Victor (\\"Vic\\") Holmes, then an unmarried gay couple who wished to marry in-state, and Nicole Dimetman and Cleopatra De Leon, a lesbian couple lawfully married in Massachusetts wanting in-state recognition of that marriage. The lead named plaintiff, Cleopatra De Leon, is a U.S. Air Force and Texas Air National Guard veteran, and in a committed relationship with her wife for 12 years at the time of the filing of the suit. Victor Holmes, a retired United States Air Force major who served almost 23 years, and Mark Phariss, a corporate attorney, were in a committed relationship for 16 years at the time of the filing of the lawsuit. On the other end, the lead named defendant is Rick Perry, sued in his official capacity as the Governor of Texas. U.S. district court action On October 28, 2013, the plaintiffs filed suit in U.S. district court, challenging the Texas' same-sex marriage ban. The case was assigned to Federal District Judge Orlando Garcia. The district judge heard oral arguments on February 12, 2014, forecasting that the issue of same-sex marriage \\"will make its way to the Supreme Court\\". Arguing for the state, Assistant Texas Solicitor General Mike Murphy said: \\"The purpose of Texas marriage law is not to discriminate against same-sex couples but to promote responsible procreation\\" and that a heterosexual couple provides the best environment for childrearing. On February 26, Garcia ruled against Texas' ban on same-sex marriage, writing that \\"Texas' current marriage laws deny homosexual couples the right to marry, and in doing so, demean their dignity for no legitimate reason\\". Garcia agreed with the plaintiffs' argument that homosexuals are a suspect class entitled to a more exacting standard of review, heightened scrutiny, but found that the state's arguments fail \\"even under the most deferential rational basis level of review\\" regarding equal protection. Regarding due process and the denial of a fundamental right, he wrote that the state's ban must be reviewed under the strict scrutiny standard. He ruled that the state has \\"failed to identify any rational, much less a compelling, reason that is served by denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry\\". He stayed enforcement of his ruling pending appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. Court of Appeals action Attorney General Greg Abbott said the state would appeal the decision. Governor Rick Perry said: \\"The 10th Amendment guarantees Texas voters the freedom to make these decisions, and this is yet another attempt to achieve via the courts what couldn't be achieved at the ballot box. We will continue to fight for the rights of Texans to self-determine the laws of our state.\\" On November 24, the plaintiffs asked the district court to lift its stay, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has denied stays in similar cases and dissolved stays by denying cert in several more. The district court denied that request on December 12. The Fifth Circuit heard oral argument on January 9, 2015, before Judges Patrick E. Higginbotham, Jerry E. Smith, and James E. Graves, Jr. On February 12, the plaintiffs asked the Fifth Circuit to lift the stay, citing the refusal of the U.S. Supreme to extend stays in similar Alabama and Florida cases, or at the least lift the stay with respect to plaintiffs De Leon and Dimetman, who expected the birth of their child on March 15 and sought to avoid the adoption process. The case and the motion to lift the stay was still pending in the Fifth Circuit when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26, 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges that the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples is unconstitutional. On July 1, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The ruling of the Fifth Circuit Court required Judge Garcia of the District Court to enter his final judgment on the case by July 17, 2015. Pursuant to the Fifth Circuit's order, the district court entered a final judgment on July 7, 2015, permanently enjoining the State of Texas from enforcing any laws prohibiting any same-sex marriage. Subsequently, in December 2015, the district court awarded more than $605,000 in legal fees and costs to the plaintiffs' law firm, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the award of legal fees in a 2-1 per curiam decision on April 18, 2017.http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/15/15-51241.0.pdf Post- decision The plaintiffs, Mark Phariss and Vic Holmes, were later married on November 21, 2015, in Frisco, Texas, at the Westin Stonebriar Hotel after more than 18 years together by former Congressman Charles A.

He is a leading expert on dual citizenship. Formerly the Rusk Professor of International Law at the University of Georgia, since 2006 he has been the Charles R. Weiner Professor of Law at Temple University. Personal life and career Spiro graduated from Harvard University in 1982, where he majored in history and wrote his senior honors thesis on France's relations with Germany in the immediate aftermath of World War II. He went on to the University of Virginia Law School, receiving his J.D. in 1987. For his first several years out of law school, Spiro circulated among various government and NGO positions in DC, spending two years in the State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser and two more as a law clerk for DC Circuit judge Stephen F. Williams and then Supreme Court Associate Justice David Souter. After spending 1992 and 1993 in private practice at Shea & Gardner, he joined the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace as a Council on Foreign Relations Fellow, and then the Clinton administration's National Security Council as Director for Democracy. Spiro began teaching at the Hofstra University School of Law in 1994, where he remained until joining the faculty of the University of Georgia School of Law as the Dean and Virginia Rusk Professor of International Law in 2004. He was additionally appointed as UGA's associate dean for faculty development in 2005. The following year, he moved on to the Temple University Beasley School of Law as one of a number of hires that year aimed at expanding the university's highly ranked international law program. Works =Beyond Citizenship= Spiro's first book, Beyond Citizenship: American Identity After Globalization, discussed the impact of dual citizenship, naturalization, and diaspora identity on citizenship in the United States. Spiro criticized traditional methods of ascribing nationality ‚Äî jus soli and jus sanguinis ‚Äî for their increasing disassociation with the reality of who participates in the American political and social community, and argued that the ultimate effect would be a decline in the importance of countries and citizenship laws. It was reviewed by political scientist Rogers Smith of the University of Pennsylvania in the Harvard Law Review. =At Home in Two Countries= Spiro's second book, At Home in Two Countries: The Past and Future of Dual Citizenship, was published in 2016 by New York University Press. It describes the evolution of legal treatment and public attitudes towards multiple nationality in the United States, including milestones such as the Expatriation Act of 1868 and the Supreme Court case Afroyim v. Rusk, as well as Spiro's own experience of acquiring German citizenship. =Selected papers=  References External links *Author page on the Social Science Research Network, including papers available for viewing & download *Posts by Spiro on Opinio Juris, a group law blog to which he, Kenneth Anderson, and eleven other authors regularly contribute * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American legal scholars Category:University of Virginia School of Law alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Temple University faculty Category:Law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States ","title":"Peter J.

He was twice elected to the House of Burgesses, in the assemblies of 1758-61 and 1761-65. On May 30, 1765 Johnston seconded Patrick Henry's speech advocating for resolutions against the Stamp Act. Johnston was elected to a third term, but died before the assembly reconvened. His death was reported in the Virginia Gazette on September 19, 1766. Johnston married Sarah McCarty (1724 - 1785), daughter of Major Dennis McCarty from Westmoreland County, Virginia. He had three children by Sarah: George, William, and Mary Massey. His son, Lt. Col George Johnston, Jr., was Aide-de-camp and confidential military secretary to General George Washington from December 1776 until his death at Morristown, New Jersey in May 1777. As a burgess, Johnston made a motion to resolve the House into a committee of the whole, seconded by Patrick Henry, at which time their coalition brought forth a shocking series of resolutions now known as the Stamp Act Resolutions. The House of Burgesses was an aristocratic company of wealthy plantation owners and gentlemen, having long operated under a relaxed rule of 24 percent constituting a quorum. With only 39 members in attendance, Johnston's motion passed, and in the absence of the House's regular leadership, all five of the offered resolutions were adopted. The first four were adopted more quickly than the fifth, which required several hours of heated debate, and even after that, passed by only one vote. George Johnston served as George Washington's attorney, and a trustee of the town of Alexandria, Virginia. At the time of his death, Washington succeeded Johnston to both positions. His son, George Johnston, served as a captain in the 5th Company, 15th Regiment of Virginia.

Early life, family, and education Sparrow was born in Inglewood on 25 June 1935 to Daniel James Muir and Jessie Isobel Muir (n√©e McMillan), and was educated at Waitara District High School and New Plymouth Girls' High School. She went on to study at Victoria University College from 1953 to 1955, graduating BSc; the University of Otago from 1957 to 1963, from where she graduated MB ChB; and the University of London, where she completed a Diploma in Venereology in 1976. In 1956, she married Peter Charles Methven Sparrow, and the couple went on to have two children. Peter Sparrow died in 1982. Career Sparrow started her career in health working at the student health centre at Victoria University of Wellington in the late 1960s. At the time, the clinic would only allow contraception to be given to married couples, and she had to go against the wishes of the director of the clinic to put up an information display about contraception. While working at the clinic, student demand for contraception led to her introducing the morning-after pill and helping students to get abortions. She worked as a medical officer at Student Health until 1981. Between 1977 and 1999 she worked as a visiting venereologist at Wellington Hospital. Sparrow was the president of the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand from 1975 to 1980, and again from 1984 until 2011. She is a Director of Istar Ltd, a not-for-profit company that imports the abortion pill mifepristone from France. The pill was approved for use in 2001, and allowed women to have medical ‚Äî rather than surgical ‚Äî abortions for the first time. No other pharmaceutical company was interested in importing the drug. Views In 2015, Sparrow stated that New Zealand's abortion law was out of date and should be reformed: She is also critical of the way the current abortion system forces women to claim they need abortions on the grounds of a danger to mental health: Honours and awards In the 1987 Queen's Birthday Honours, Sparrow was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to medicine and the community, and in 1993 she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, she was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to medicine and the community, and in 2009 she accepted redesignation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government. The family planning clinic in Wellington is named after Sparrow. Sparrow was a keen collector of contraceptive devices, which were later donated to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. In 2015‚Äì16, Te Papa used them as the core of an exhibition on contraception.The Dame Margaret Sparrow Collection, tepapa.govt.nz; accessed 21 March 2017.

They register on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. These users follow active members, but do not partake in liking, commenting, messaging, and posting. These accounts may be created by people or by social bots. Ghost follower scams Many ghost followers are accounts created by scammers who create fictional profiles and use them to target and scam others. \\"Social Networking Scams\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 11 June 2014.  Buying followers  Commercial services provide the ability to buy Instagram followers, most of which are ghosts. These individuals are paid to follow accounts but are not required to engage with them. This allows those seeking publicity to quickly increase their number of followers and appear to be popular, or \\"trending\\". For example, Rantic (formerly \\"SocialVEVO\\" and \\"Swenzy\\") was able to increase the number of Daily Dot's Twitter followers from 48,000 followers to 122,000 in only four days.\\"Hoaxsters Bought Us 75,000 Fake Followers in a New Kind of Twitter Attack.\\" The Daily Dot. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 June 2014. This faux- popularity may still attract \\"volunteer\\" users. However, this technique may backfire if its use becomes known. According to Olivier Blanchard, unless the objective is just to appear popular, purchased ghosts do not help meet business objectives, other than possibly a form of brand marketing. In January 2018 an article in the New York Times described the business of a company called Devumi in selling ghost followers on Twitter, and named many of Devumi's customers. =Rantic.com= Rantic is perhaps the most widely publicized seller of ghost followers.\\"Friends, and Influence, for Sale Online\\" The New York Times Web. 20 April 2014. According to a New York Times report, Rantic's clientele includes corporations, celebrities, journalists, politicians and even governments.\\"Instagram could delete up to 10 million accounts\\" International Business Times Web. 11 December 2014. The company rose to international mainstream media attention over its \\"controversial\\" bots, which can reportedly generate millions of user accounts on social media platforms. These ghost followers are being purchased for many popular social platforms including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and SoundCloud.\\"Rantic: How your followers would look if you buy USA Twitter followers\\" Rantic.com Web. 30 November 2014. As a result, the practice of selling ghost followers has turned into a multimillion-dollar online business, according to another New York Times report.\\"Fake Twitter Followers Become Multimillion-Dollar Business\\" New York Times Web. 05 April 2013.  Removal  As of 2014, removing a ghost requires accessing the account and explicitly blocking it. This will immediately remove the connection between the ghost follower and your account. Ghosts can be avoided by marking an account as private, requiring would-be followers to request permission. Since May 2018, Twitter has been trying to clean up its platform from phony records who ruined the experience of the real social media users. Their objectives run from trolling, cyberbullying, and most importantly controlling political talk or even to con influencer advertisers into forking over cash to fake web-based social networking influencers.

The film follows John Nguyen, a war veteran suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. After he rescues a prostitute, Hollis, a local crime lord, marks them for death. It was released direct to video in the United States on March 11, 2014, followed by a limited release in other countries.  Plot  John Nguyen is a veteran suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite his status as a war hero, he's had difficulty adjusting to civilian life. When he hears a woman scream, he investigates and gets into a fight with several Aryan Nation thugs who are hassling Tanya, a prostitute in the service of local crime boss Hollis. Tanya is horrified when John kills all but one of the thugs; although thankful for his help, she says that John has doomed them both to die at Hollis' hands. Planning to flee the city, Tanya buys a bus ticket, but Hollis convinces her to stay by promising her that she can come off the streets and live with him again. Hollis directs his lieutenant Vin to murder John's family. Although reluctant, Vin complies. Enraged, John tracks down Bennett, a drug dealer, and strikes back at Hollis' meth business, brutally killing several of the men responsible for his family's death. As Hollis and John war with each other, two cops try to solve the case. Sgt. Mitchell believes John to be honorable, while his partner, a dirty cop in the employ of Hollis, attempts to derail the investigation. John recruits his disabled war buddy J. P. to help him in the final confrontation with Hollis. As Hollis is in the midst of violently raping Tanya, Vin intercedes. Before Vin and Hollis can come to blows, John assaults Hollis' house. John kills most of Hollis' henchmen and leaves Vin to die after a knife fight. Although John captures Hollis, reinforcements arrive and turn the tide against him. Both John and J. P. are captured, and Hollis murders J. P. John challenges Hollis to a one-on-one fight, and, when John appears to be winning, Tanya shoots and kills Hollis' remaining henchmen before they can interfere. After John kills Hollis, Mitchell arrives and tells him to leave the scene of the crime, as he will clean it up.

Jane criticized the film's cinematography, saying that it relies \\"too heavily on shaky cam tactics\\". On the other hand, he complimented the film for being \\"fast paced, reasonably well acted, [very] violent and generally [a] solid [piece of] entertainment\\" for the \\"less demanding action movie aficionado\\".

Career Though Dahl received a football scholarship from the University of Minnesota, he transferred to and graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in 1976 with a degree in physical education and social sciences. Dahl began his coaching career a few years later when he took over the top job at Bethel College from David Harris. Over the course of 5 seasons at the helm Dahl directed the fledgling program on an upwards trajectory, going from 3 wins in his first season to 15 in his last, including being named 1985 MIAC Coach of the Year. Dahl moved east for 1985-86, taking over at Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls before receiving the opportunity to serve under storied college coach Herb Brooks as an assistant with St. Cloud State as it was getting ready to move up to Division I. Dahl remained as an assistant for only one season, however, as Brooks moved back to the NHL to coach the Minnesota North Stars the next year. With the Huskies playing as a D-I independent starting in 1987-88, Dahl was offered the head coaching duties and proceeded to serve in that position for the next 19 years.

In 1991 St. Cloud joined the WCHA, giving it a much better opportunity to receive further invites to the NCAA tournament though it took over a decade for the Huskies t make their return. Despite playing against multiple powerhouse teams throughout the 1990s, Dahl was able to keep St. Cloud's record respectable, posting 4 winning seasons and finishing with a sub-.400 mark only once (1995‚Äì96) while also making the conference tournament title game in 1994. Dahl closed out the Huskies first decade with the WCHA by leading St. Cloud to their first tournament berth in 2000. The next season Dahl led the Huskies to their first 30-win season and conference tournament championship (the only time in school for either (as of 2014)). From 2000 to 2003 Dahl brought the St. Cloud to four consecutive NCAA tournament berths but failed to win a single game.

Otter is a case initiated in 2013 in U.S. federal court by plaintiffs seeking to prevent the state of Idaho from enforcing its ban on same-sex marriage. The plaintiffs won in U.S. District Court. The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard this together with two related cases‚ÄìJackson v. Abercrombie, and Sevcik v. Sandoval. The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on September 8 and affirmed the District Court's ruling on October 7. State officials requested and received an emergency stay of the Ninth Circuit's ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on October 8, which Justice Anthony Kennedy vacated on October 10, denying the requested stay. Introduction In November 2013, four Idaho lesbian couples filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court, Latta v. Otter, challenging the state's ban on same- sex marriage. They were represented by the National Center for Lesbian Rights. One couple was married in California in 2008, another in New York in 2011. Two of the four couples were raising a child. They named as defendants Governor Butch Otter and Ada County Clerk Chris Rich. The parties are disputing Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden's attempt to intervene on behalf of the state. Both parties asked the court for summary judgment. U.S. district court ruling Latta v. Otter was heard before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Dale on May 5, 2014 and she issued her ruling on May 13. The decision granted the plaintiff same-sex couples' motion for summary judgment, declared Idaho marriage laws that ban same-sex marriage unconstitutional, and enjoined state officials from enforcing any law to the extent it restricts same-sex couples from marrying or from having their marriages recognized. In her decision, Judge Dale dispensed with Baker v. Nelson: \\"The Supreme Court's due process and equal protection jurisprudence has developed significantly in the four decades after Baker, and, in last year‚Äôs Windsor decision, the Court dramatically changed tone with regard to laws that withhold marriage benefits from same-sex couples.\\" She argued individual liberty and Fourteenth Amendment protection: \\"An individual's protected liberties include certain fundamental rights of personhood. These rights center on the most significant decisions of a lifetime‚Äîwhom to marry, whether to have children, and how to raise and educate children. ... rights sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect.\\" She applied these rights and liberties to same-sex couples: \\"More recently, the Supreme Court confirmed that gay and lesbian individuals do not forfeit their constitutional liberties simply because of their sexual orientation...the Supreme Court's marriage cases demonstrate that the right to marry is an individual right, belonging to all. If every individual enjoys a constitutional right to marry, what is the substance of that right for gay or lesbian individuals who cannot marry their partners of choice?\\" (internal citations omitted). Dale summarized by stating: Dale issued an injunction prohibiting the state from denying recognition to same-sex marriages, effective May 16. U.S. Court of Appeals activity The defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit and on May 15 a three- judge panel issued a temporary stay of Judge Dale's injunction. On May 20, the panel granted a stay during appeal. U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz concurred, writing that \\"solely because I believe that the Supreme Court, in Herbert v. Kitchen ... has virtually instructed courts of appeals to grant stays in the circumstances before us today. If we were writing on a cleaner state, I would conclude that application of the familiar factors ... counsels against the stay requested by the Idaho appellants.\\" On May 30, state defendants petitioned the Ninth Circuit to hear the case before an en banc panel of 11 justices rather than a 3-judge panel because any ruling \\"will carry profound legal and broader social consequences\\". The state also argued that there is a circuit split in the U.S. Courts of Appeals with respect to the level of scrutiny used when deciding cases of discrimination based on sexual orientation, that plaintiffs will argue heightened scrutiny, based on the Ninth Circuit decision in SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., while the other circuits have applied the less restrictive standard of scrutiny called \\"rational basis review.\\" On August 19, the Ninth Circuit denied the state's request for an initial hearing en banc.Otter v. Latta, Order, August 19, 2014 It scheduled oral argument for September 8 before Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Ronald M. Gould, and Marsha S. Berzon.Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: Oral Argument Notice, accessed September 1, 2014 Because of public interest in this and other same-sex marriage cases under Ninth Circuit jurisdiction, the court set up a web site where orders and filings in these cases can be downloaded as they become available. The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on September 8. It upheld the district court's ruling on October 7. The Ninth Circuit's order implementing its decision was challenged by Idaho officials in the early morning hours of October 8. They asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay while they pursued further litigation, and Justice Anthony Kennedy granted a temporary stay within hours. The plaintiffs responded on October 9. On October 10, after Justice Kennedy withdrew his emergency stay in Latta, Idaho Governor Butch Otter announced the state would no longer attempt to preserve the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. Also on October 10, the Latta plaintiffs asked the Ninth Circuit to lift the stay of the district court's order that it had imposed on May 20. The Ninth Circuit gave the parties until October 13 to reply. On October 13, the Ninth Circuit rejected the contrary arguments and lifted its stay of the district court's order enjoining Idaho officials from enforcing the state's ban on same-sex marriage, effective 9 a.m. PDT October 15. On October 21, Governor Otter asked the Ninth Circuit to re-hear the case en banc. Having received no response, both he and the state filed petitions for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on December 30, 2014, and January 2, 2015, respectively. The Ninth Circuit denied the request for rehearing en banc on January 9, 2015. Latta asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case. That court, on June 26 ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples is unconstitutional. On June 30, the Supreme Court denied that certiorari request.

Prior to being elected as mayor of Regina, Fougere served as a city councillor in Ward 4 which covered the majority of the city's south-eastern neighbourhoods, being re-elected five times. He was first elected to city council in 1997. At the time he was the co-founder of the Association of Concerned Taxpayers. Prior to his election as mayor, Fougere served on various civic boards such as the Wascana Centre Authority, Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association, Tourism Regina and the Regina Downtown Business Improvement District. During his first mayoral campaign, Fougere was the lone candidate that supported the funding arrangement between the city, the province and the Saskatchewan Roughriders for the construction of the new Mosaic Stadium, which opened in 2016. Under his tenure, a city-wide referendum on a new waste water treatment facility was held on September 25th 2013. The issue of the referendum was whether the facility would be financed through a Public-private partnership (P3) or through the design-bid-build (DBB) approach. After initially opposing the call for a referendum, Fougere's administration campaigned in favour of a P3. The result was 57% against the DBB approach, and the treatment plant ended up being financed by a P3.\\" In January 2019, Fougere came out in support of an NHL game to be played at Mosaic Stadium.

The company was founded in 2003 by Bob Carr and John Knowles to further develop a technique Bob Carr had invented to visualize nanoparticles suspended in liquid. The company has since developed the technique of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and they produce a series of instruments to count, size and visualize nanoparticles in liquid suspension using this patented technology. NanoSight has 25 employees in the UK and has received several awards and recognitions.A Queen's Award for Enterprise for International Trade 2012 has been awarded to NanoSight. Nanotechnology Now, 1 May 2012. More than 450 instruments had been sold as of 2012. The technology has been cited in over 1300 scientific publications, presentations and reports. NanoSight was acquired by Malvern Instruments on 30 September 2013. Product overview NanoSight develops and produces instruments that visualize, characterize and measure small particles in suspension. Detected particles may be as small as 10 nm in diameter, depending on composition. NanoSight instruments can analyze particle size, concentration, aggregation, and zeta potential. An optional fluorescence mode, employing an optical filter, allows speciation of fluorescently labeled particles. Each instrument comprises a scientific camera, a microscope,*Bob Carr, Patrick Hole, Andrew Malloy, Jonathan Smith, Andrew Weld and Jeremy Warren (2008) \\"The real-time, simultaneous analysis of nanoparticle size, zeta potential, count, asymmetry and fluorescence in liquids\\", Particles 2008; Particle Synthesis, Characterization, and Particle-Based Advanced Materials, 10‚Äì13 May 2008, Wyndham Orlando Resort, Orlando, Florida.*Warren, J and Carr, R (2007), \\"Application of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis to BioNano Systems\\", 2nd International Congress of Nanobiotechnology & Nanomedicine (NanoBio2007), San Francisco, USA, 19 June 2007. and a sample viewing unit (LM12 or LM14). The viewing unit uses a laser diode to illuminate particles in liquid suspension that are held within or advanced through a flow chamber within the unit. The instrument is used in conjunction with a computer control unit that runs a custom-designed Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) software package. NTA analyzes videos captured using the instrument, giving a particle size distribution and particle count based upon tracking of each particle's Brownian motion. Tracking is carried out for all particles in the laser scattering volume to produce a particle size distribution using the Stokes- Einstein equation, relating the Brownian motion of a particle to a sphere- equivalent hydrodynamic radius. Instruments Several instruments are currently available. General specifications: ::*Nanoparticle analysis range: typically 10‚Äì1000 nm, dependent on particle material ::*Particle type: any ::*Solvent: any non-corrosive solvent and water. A range of solvent-resistant seals are available. ::*Power requirement (own adapter supplied): 110‚Äì220 V ::*Laser output: Various. 40 mW at 640 nm (Class 1 Laser Product) for basic LM10 and LM20 models. Other lasers are available. ::*Viewing chamber volume requirements: 0.3 ml (most models) or 0.1 ml (NS500, although larger volumes must be loaded into the fluidics system if sample is not directly injected) =LM10= An LM10 Instrument NanoSight's LM10 instrument is based upon a conventional optical microscope fitted with a scientific camera (CCD, EMCCD or sCMOS) and either the LM12 or LM14 viewing unit. Using a laser light source with a wavelength of 405 nm (blue), 532 nm (green), or 638 nm (red), the particles in the sample are illuminated and the scattered light is captured by the camera and displayed on the connected personal computer running Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) software. Using NTA, the particles are automatically tracked and sized. Results are displayed as a frequency size distribution graph and are exported in various, user-selected formats including spreadsheets and video files. Additionally, information-rich videos clips may be captured and archived for future reference and alternative analyses. The LM10 is proven with most nanoparticle classes down to 10 nm (dependent upon particle density) dispersed in a wide range of solvents. =LM10-HS= An LM10-HS Instrument The LM10-HS instrument is similar to the standard LM10 unit but has a higher sensitivity sCMOS camera (EMCCD in earlier models). This allows smaller, lower refractive index particles to be analyzed. The LM10-HS is more commonly used for sizing biological samples including viruses and vaccines. =LM20= An LM20 Instrument NanoSight's LM20 is, in essence, a 'boxed-up' LM10, designed and created for greater ease of use. Using the same standard LM12 viewing unit as the LM10, this instrument provides identical results to those obtained in analyses run on an LM10 system. Typically, the LM20 is used in more industrial applications, such as analyzing particles used in paints, pigments, cosmetics, and foodstuffs. The LM20 is ideal for users unfamiliar with using a microscope. =NS500= The NS500 incorporates multiple automated features, including computer-controlled peristaltic pumps and stage positioning, for reproducibility and ease of use. Through the interface of the NTA Software Suite, the fluidics system may be used to inject samples into a small viewing chamber, dilute samples to a specified degree, flush the system between samples, or clean and dry the viewing chamber. In contrast with earlier models, the NS500 does not require manual cleaning of the viewing chamber between each sample, thus increasing throughput. Optical stage positions may be set for optical and fluorescent readings, improving reproducibility. Sample temperature control is also programmable. The NS500 can be used for both static as flow measurement using the additional syringe pump. A sample changer can provide enhanced throughput for static measurements, and using scripts high-throughput measurements under flow are available as well. =NS200= Like the LM20, but with a high- sensitivity camera like that of the NS500, the NS200 has a housing and is ideal for use in industrial settings, such as manufacture of inks, paints, pigments, petrochemicals, and vaccines. Its configuration is designed for study of small or otherwise weakly scattering nanoparticles, such as viruses, phage, liposomes and other drug delivery nanoparticles, and protein aggregates. It can be used in a non-laboratory environment by individuals unfamiliar with microscopes. Applications NanoSight instruments are used for a variety of applications, including: ::*Ceramic and metallic nanoparticles ::*Pigments, paints and sun creams ::*Exosomes, microvesicles, outer membrane vesicles, and other small biological particles ::*Pharmaceutical particles - liposomes ::*Viruses ::*Carbon nanotubes (multi- walled) ::*Colloidal suspensions and polymer particles ::*Cosmetics and foodstuffs ::*Particles in fuels and oils (soot, catalyst, wax etc.) ::*Wear debris in lubricants ::*Chemical Mechanical Polishing Slurries ::*Nanotoxicology studies In 2011, the European Union (EU) announced that companies that use nanoparticles in their products may be required to report the quantity and size of their nanomaterials. NanoSight suggests that its products will be important for companies seeking to satisfy the new requirements.

Newspaper history  The Cootamundra Herald, subtitled Murrumburrah, Bethungra and Bland Advertiser, was founded by Thomas Campbell Brown (c. 1855 ‚Äì 7 April 1936) and Frederick Pinkstone (1847 ‚Äì 2 January 1922) and first published on 30 January 1877. Brown, a friend of Pinkstone for even longer than they were business partners, left for Sydney in 1883, and Pinkstone continued as editor until 1916, when he was forced to retire due to illness. He called on his son William Henry to take over the editorship which he did until the age of 75 and held the ownership until his death at 78. William Henry's son Harry Pinkstone then inherited the paper and edited it for five years before his own death at the age of 48. Harry Pinkstone's widow eventually sold the newspaper to the Bradley family in 1963. On 2 October 1990 the Bradley family sold the newspaper to Rural Press Limited which merged with Fairfax in 2007. Barry Clarke was the longest standing editor of The Cootamundra Herald, a position he held from approximately 1965-1997. He was known for his strong editorial and campaigning for the benefits of the community. Between approximately 1946 and 1954 the newspaper issued in a daily frequency and was briefly titled Cootamundra Daily Herald. More recently it was published twice weekly (Wednesday and Friday) both on-line and as hard copy until 17 March 2020, when the printed version was suspended, initially for three months, attributable to the economic decline that attended the COVID-19 pandemic. Competition In August 1882 the Cootamundra Liberal was founded, for many years owned by Edwin Doidge, father of Frederick W. Doidge. In 1928, shortly after being renamed the Cootamundra Daily News, the paper was purchased from its proprietor, William John Bright (c. 1886 ‚Äì c. 1 April 1966), by the Herald, and discontinued. The Liberal and the Herald have been confused by commentators.

Hodnet Old Hall was a timber-framed manor house surrounded by the park which was recorded on Christopher Saxton's Map of Shropshire in the late 16th century. Historically it was owned by the Heber family, the family of the noted English cleric Reginald Heber. In 1752 a Richard Heber received the manor and estate as a bequest from a cousin of his wife. On Richard Heber's death in 1766 his brother, named Reginald, who had taken Holy Orders and was co-rector of the parish of Malpas in Cheshire, inherited the estate. The old hall was demolished in 1870 when a new hall in the neo-Elizabethan style was built. It was the boyhood home of Robert Heber- Percy, known as \\"the Mad Boy\\" and \\"an English eccentric in the grand tradition\\". In the 20th century the hall was used as a convalescent hospital during the world wars, and in World War II there was an airfield in the grounds for the storage and dispersal of aircraft from Ternhill and RAF Shawbury. Today the hall is particularly noted for its gardens, created in 1922 when rare trees, shrubs and a chain of seven lakes and pools was added. The gardens contains rhododendrons, camellias, crocuses, daffodils and magnolias. They are open to the public on Sundays and Bank Holidays from early April to late September.

He was the Principal Librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales (now State Library of New South Wales) from 1912 until his retirement in 1942. Early life William Ifould was born at One Tree Hill near Gawler, South Australia on 28 August 1877. He was the son of Edward Lomer Ifould and Marion Burn Ifould, n√©e Cameron. He attended the Sturt Street School and Norwood State School in Adelaide before winning a scholarship to the Adelaide Collegiate School. He attended the University of Adelaide from 1902‚Äì07. He married Carrie Eugenie Foale on 5 March 1907. Career William Ifould began his library career as a cadet at the Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery of South Australia in 1892. He held a number of different positions over twenty years at the Library and in 1905 was appointed Principal Librarian. He introduced the Dewey Decimal classification system to the Library, overseeing a twelve- year project reclassifying the collections. On his departure from Adelaide, Ifould gave a revealing interview to journalists from The Advertiser newspaper indicating he had experienced a challenging working relationship with the board of the Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery of South Australia. Ifould had a lifelong interest in horticulture. He founded the National Rose Society of New South Wales in 1912, wrote a gardening column in the Evening News for many years, and in his spare time developed an orange orchard at Waikerie in South Australia. He was passionate about architecture and the arts, and for 39 years served as a trustee on the Board of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Ifould was active in Rotary International, representing Australia at the International Rotary Convention in St. Louis in June 1923. =At the Public Library of New South Wales= In 1912 the Trustees of the Public Library of New South Wales recommended Ifould to the Minister and he was appointed to the position of Principal Librarian of the Public Library of New South Wales (now State Library of New South Wales) a position he held from 1912 until his retirement in 1942. When Ifould took up his position at the Library, the new Mitchell Library building had recently opened in 1910 while the public library remained in a building on Bent Street. The poor state of the Bent Street building was noted in Library Annual Reports and debated in the local press. As the collections grew in the 1920s the conditions at the library became very crowded in both the Mitchell Wing and the Bent Street building. The Mitchell wing had been designed as the first instalment of a proposed National Library. William Ifould cultivated the interest of Sir William Dixson as a library benefactor. Dixson, a wealthy bachelor with an interest in collecting paintings, manuscripts and an extensive Australiana collection, had a long association with the Library. In 1919 Dixson wrote to Ifould, offering his pictures collection to the NSW Government if they would provide a suitable space for them to be stored and displayed. Ifould persistently advocated the completion of the library building to the government. In 1924 Ifould provided information to a Sydney Morning Herald journalist about the value of Sir William's collection and the importance of it being accepted by the Government and housed in a new wing of the Mitchell Library building. In 1925 the Library Trustees reported that work was to begin on the new sections of the library building. Ifould oversaw the design and construction of the next stages of the Mitchell Library, the basement section to house the Country Circulation Department in 1928, the Dixson Wing which opened in 1929 and the central portion and entrance which was completed in 1942 to house the general reference collection. The plans for the enlarged and remodelled central portion and north-east wing were prepared by the Government Architect, Cobden Parkes, with advice from Ifould and Nita Kibble the Principal Research Officer at the Library. Ifould was very involved in the design and decoration of the Library. Ifould also oversaw the establishment of the Research Department of the General Reference Library in 1919‚Äì20 as an extension of the reading room reference service creating a library service that was accessible to the public, including people living in country areas not just to researchers and scholars. Ifould built the reputation of the Library as a leading institution in the Commonwealth for collecting records and documents relating to Australian history. As Principal Librarian during World War I, William Ifould recognised the significance of the personal stories of Australian servicemen in World War I to the nation's historical record. In December 1918 he launched The European War Collecting Project. Ifould placed newspaper advertisements around Australia, New Zealand and in the United Kingdom seeking diaries, letters, photographs and related material from servicemen and their families to be deposited in the library collection. Approximately 500 diaries were collected by the Library through the campaign. =The New South Wales Library Act 1939= There were very few free public libraries available to the people of New South Wales in the early years of the twentieth century. Different types of subscription libraries, including mechanics institutes, schools of arts and some commercial lending libraries were the only option in many communities. Several municipal libraries had begun only to close down and by the 1930s there were only two free lending libraries which served the people of Broken Hill and Sydney. In 1934, at the instigation of the Australian Council for Educational Research the Carnegie Corporation of New York funded two commissioners, Ralph Munn and E. R. Pitt, to tour and inspect Australian libraries and to publish their report. The Munn-Pitt report examined the differences between regional library networks in Australia and the United States of America and England. The report was highly critical of the state of libraries across the country. The main recommendations from the Munn‚ÄìPitt report were the strengthening and growth of the profession of librarianship in Australia through the establishment of a library association to raise the status of trained library staff; fostering the National Library's development; combined state-municipal libraries in all capital cities except Sydney; the establishment of rate-supported municipal free libraries outside the capital cities, with continued state government subsidies; the establishment of district or regional library services covering small towns and rural areas. Not all of the Munn‚ÄìPitt recommendations were adopted, however two of these recommendations were priorities for William Ifould \\"to establish tax-supported municipal 'free libraries'; and to strengthen and extend librarianship by professionalising the training and registration of librarians.\\" In New South Wales, the Munn‚ÄìPitt report was the impetus for the establishment of a lobbying group. William Ifould addressed a public meeting held on 26 June 1935 in Chatswood where the Free Library Movement (FLM) was established. They enlisted a range of high-profile supporters and created a publicity campaign which included distributing transcripts of a speech by Geoffrey Cochrane Remington, a prominent Sydney solicitor, an address by Mrs Hubert Fairfax to the Country Women's Association in 1937 together with several radio interviews all promoting the introduction of public libraries. A visiting Carnegie scholar, Hartley Grattan, also published a leaflet Libraries: a necessity for democracy in 1938 supporting the free public library cause. In response to the lobbying of the Free Library Movement the Minister for Education, D. H. Drummond, established the Libraries Advisory Committee which was chaired by William Ifould. The Committee prepared a report which was adopted in principle by the New South Wales Cabinet in January 1939 and led to the preparation of a Library Bill. Some of the Munn-Pitt report recommendations, including the establishment of free public libraries in every local council area, were enshrined in the Library Bill, which Ifould and Deputy Principal Librarian John Wallace Metcalfe helped to draft. The progress of these activities was interrupted in September 1939 by the outbreak of World War II. In September 1939, Cabinet deferred the introduction of the Library Bill into Parliament. The Free Library Movement continued to lobby the government. Ifould approached members of the exclusive Australian Club winning their support along with other businessmen and newspaper editors. Ifould suggested to the Minister that the Act could be passed but the financial clauses deferred, adding that \\"If the Government drops the Library Bill at this stage every important metropolitan newspaper will hammer it as showing no courage or leadership. I will give the newspapers all the pabulum they require for such a campaign. I must, of course, first resign from the service.\\" Cabinet met on 10 October 1939 agreeing to introduce the Bill into Parliament while suspending the financial provisions. The Library Bill passed through the New South Wales Parliament on 3 November 1939 with bipartisan support. The involvement of Australia in World War II delayed the full implementation of the Library Act 1939 until Premier William McKell announced that the Act would be fully proclaimed, including the financial clauses, taking effect from 1 January 1944. Municipalities began to introduce public library services, with 32 councils adopting the Act by the middle of 1945. Another of the Munn‚ÄìPitt report recommendations, that professional training be made available for librarians, was also implemented by Ifould when a Library School was established at the Public Library of New South Wales in 1939. It also experienced an interruption due to World War II and was suspended during 1940 but reopened in 1941. =Australian Institute of Librarians= Group photograph of the delegates attending the Australian Institute of Librarians' inaugural meeting at Canberra, 20 August 1937. During the Great Depression awareness of social and political issues had grown in Australia, including censorship and the freedom of expression. As a profession, librarians responded by establishing the Australian Institute of Librarians (AIL). Fifty- five librarians attended the inaugural meeting of the AIL in Canberra on 20 August 1937 to form the association. William Ifould was elected as the foundation president (1937‚Äì38). John Metcalfe wrote that they believed in access to \\"the best that has been and is being thought and said, pictured and played, written and read by our people, and throughout the world\\" Later life Following his retirement from the library in February 1942, Ifould was appointed Deputy Director of the Department of War Organisation of Industry in New South Wales. William Ifould died on 6 April 1969. He was survived by one son, Edward Lister Ifould, but his two younger sons were killed in action in World War II.

Less well known than the 40 mm quick- firing AA gun, the gun was nevertheless adopted by armed forces of numerous countries during World War II, including Argentina, China, Dutch East Indies, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Persia and Thailand. It was closely related to the 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41, one of the best-known AA guns of World War II, which was partially based on it. Some pieces captured by the Japanese in China served as the blueprint for the Type 4 75 mm AA Gun, a reverse-engineered clone of the Bofors 75mm gun.  History and Development  World War I AA guns were often pieces of standard medium-calibre artillery modified for anti- aircraft fire. However, fast development of aerial warfare meant that a higher muzzle velocity was needed to target modern planes flying faster and at higher altitudes. Having lost the war, Germany had been forbidden from developing new weapons of most types by the Versailles treaty. However, the Krupp company almost immediately started cooperation with the Swedish Bofors (partially owned by Krupp) to develop a new AA gun. By 1925 Krupp acquired a controlling interest in the Swedish firm and a team of German experts was sent to Sweden. The development of a new gun was funded secretly by the Reichswehr. The resulting 75 mm gun proved adequate to the Swedes, but extensive trials of two German prototypes (the 7,5 cm Flugabwehrkanone L/60 and 7,5 cm Flugabwehrkanone L/59) by the German army proved unsatisfactory and the Germans requested a heavier design. The 75 mm was then modified to include a larger calibre barrel, which was further developed into the 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41, one of the best-known AA guns of World War II. Nevertheless, despite the German unwillingness to buy the 75 mm variant, the Swedish company decided to start serial production anyway. There were many notable differences between Krupp's design and the one eventually produced by the Swedish company, but both guns shared a similar layout and a cruciform firing platform, which allowed the gun to traverse full 360 degrees and fire in all directions. The platform was lowered to the ground from two wheeled axles, which had to be removed before firing. One of major advantages of the Swedish design over the 88 eventually adopted by Germany was its simplicity: it lacked complicated fire-control mechanisms, but was easy enough to operate by less-well trained crews in poorer countries. The m/29 and m/30 guns formed the backbone of the Swedish passive air defence during and immediately after World War II  Operational use  The Swedish gun entered service in the Swedish Army under two distinct designations: luftv√§rnskanon m/29 and luftv√§rnskanon m/30, both produced either in 75 mm (\\"7,5 cm\\") and 80 mm (\\"8 cm\\") bore, depending on the order. In November 1929 Finland bought eight early prototypes and test-series guns of the mobile variant and pressed them into service as 76 ItK/29 B and 76 ItK/28 B, ItK standing for IlmaTorjuntaKanuunaan, \\"Anti-air gun\\". Unlike later models, the gun used a different transport system with one heavy axle and two wheels. During the Winter War the guns were coupled with Vickers M34 Vc fire- control mechanical computers. In 1938 Persia bought 24 pieces of slightly modified Luftv√§rnskanon m/30-37 (also known as Luftv√§rnskanon m/37), intended for 6 batteries of 4 guns each. The outbreak of World War II prevented any further deliveries. Hungarian 8-cm 29M in Russia, 1942 One of the largest batches of the gun were bought by Hungary (all in 80 mm variant), which successfully used it on the Eastern Front of World War II both in anti- aircraft and anti-tank role (under the designation of 8-cm 29M). Gy√∂rgy Szebeny also designed a version of the 40M Nimr√≥d self-propelled AA gun armed with the 80 mm Bofors instead of the original 40 mm gun, but it never went into production. Greece ordered 80 mm variant and used it to reinforce the air defence of the Metaxas Line. Between 1935 and 1938 the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army ordered 52 pieces of slightly modified Luftv√§rnskanon m/36 gun in 80 mm L/50 variant. Out of those 36 were delivered, 12 on mobile cruciform platforms and the rest to be used on fixed positions. Most were delivered in parts and then assembled at Wilton-Fijenoord facilities. The Dutch East Indies forces used the guns to bolster the defence of key ports, notably eight pieces were protecting Soerabaja against the Japanese invasion.

Early history J. McGonigle founded The Free Lance as the Hollister Enterprise on October 18, 1873. On December 10, 1886, W.B. Winn began publishing under the Free Lance nameplate. After eight years of publishing in Hollister, Winn sold the newspaper in February 1891 to J. L. Lahiff and moved to San Francisco. The Free Lance merged with the Hesperian. Lahiff was city editor, and business partner Robert P. Stephenson served as editor. \\"The paper is enthusiastically and aggressively Republican in politics,\\" an 1893 author wrote. Printer James Piratsky acquired a 50 percent interest in the newspaper around that time. The Hollister newspaper market was a competitive one. In 1921, the publisher of the Free Lance, which claimed a circulation of 1,019, placed an ad in Editor and Publisher, a trade magazine, offering a $250 reward to anyone who could produce proof that the Morning Daily Advance of Hollister published more than 1,026 copies. Corporate Ownership McClatchy Newspapers purchased the Free Lance in 1981. On February 28, 1997, McClatchy sold the Dispatch, along with the Hollister Free Lance, the Morgan Hill Times and the Amador Ledger to Independent Newspapers Ltd. of New Zealand. Independent's largest shareholder was Australia-based News Ltd., controlled by publisher Rupert Murdoch. The New Zealand group sold the papers in 1998 to Central Valley Publishing Holdings, Inc., an operator of 30 small-market papers that was based in Festus, Missouri. Purchase of The Pinnacle At the end of 2003, Mainstreet Media, a company formed by Central Valley Publishing executives and backed by private equity funding, acquired the publishing group. A year later, the group acquired its competitor, The Pinnacle, from Tracie Cone and Anna Marie dos Remedios, who had purchased The Pinnacle in 1999. Cone retired from the Pinnacle in 2005 and in 2006 ran unsuccessfully for San Benito County supervisor. The Pinnacle nameplate was retired in 2013. The same year, Mainstreet‚Äôs controlling shareholder, The Brookside Group of Stamford, CT, put its California newspapers on the market. Current Ownership In April 2014, the Hollister Free Lance returned to ownership by a Northern California publisher with its purchase by New SV Media Inc., a subsidiary of Metro Newspapers of San Jose, California. In October 2014, Metro‚Äôs CEO began to move the paper away from its alignment with petroleum drilling interests and attacks on environmentalists, publicly separating itself from a $1.9 million oil company-funded political campaign in opposition to San Benito County Measure J that heavily featured the Free Lance‚Äôs logo and quotes from an opinion piece by its former editorial board. Coverage The paper's coverage and circulation are concentrated on the San Benito County, including Hollister and San Juan Bautista. San Benito Magazine On July 15, 2016, the Free Lance launched and began distributing San Benito magazine inside each issue. The full color magazine replaced the Free Lance‚Äôs former ‚ÄúLifestyles‚Äù section. Awards The Free Lance has won many awards from the California Newspaper Publishers Association for its editorial work. The Free Lance and Pinnacle together won seven CNPA awards in 2011. It won first place in investigative or enterprise reporting, for Connor Ramey, Kollin Kosmicki and Marty Richman's stories on the 2010 San Benito County sheriff's race; first place in breaking news, for coverage of the Pentagon shooting involving a Hollister resident, by Adam Breen, Melissa Flores, Andrew Matheson, Lora Schraft and Kosmicki; first place in the sports photo category for Nick Lovejoy's coverage of San Benito High School sports; second place in the sports photo category, also for Lovejoy's coverage of local sports; second place in online breaking news for coverage of the Pentagon shooting involving a Hollister resident, by Breen, Flores, Matheson, Schraft and Kosmicki. The Pinnacle competed against other weekly newspapers with a circulation of 11,001 to 25,000. It won in the following categories: second place for a breaking news photo by Lovejoy while covering the Eagle Recycling fire; second place for a sports photo by Lovejoy involving cross-country. The prior year, in 2010, the newspaper also captured six awards ‚Äì for photography, sports and investigative reporting. The Free Lance won seven CNPA awards in the 2015 Better Newspapers Contest. Sports Editor Emanuel Lee won first place for the Free Lance‚Äôs sports coverage. Second-place awards were given for photography and columns, and blue ribbons were awarded for agriculture reporting, sports feature and lifestyle coverage. Under editor Barry Holtzclaw, the Free Lance won two 2017 CNPA first place awards for ‚ÄúEnterprise News Story‚Äù and ‚ÄúEditorial Comment‚Äù and one second place award for ‚ÄúEditorial Comment‚Äù for pieces on the disappearance of funds in a charitable trust managed by school board member Mitchell Dabo.

In the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century, the last resident of Courbefy bought one by one all the houses and lands of the village, after having built a hotel and restaurant in the 1990s. In 2008 he went bankrupt and left the village. In February 2012, a judicial procedure assigned his property to a creditor bank, which then put the whole hamlet up for auction. On 21 May 2012, the village was acquired by Yoo Byung-eun for ().  Monuments  One of three holy wells in Courbefy to the right and a cross of devotion left. A small chapel of the seventeenth century lies a few dozen meters from the old dungeon. Courbefy has three holy wells located a few hundred meters from the chapel. One of them is still used as evidenced by the numerous offerings of pieces of cloth, children's shoes or diapers. They seem to be dedicated to Saint Eutropius.

Facts The case specifically related to a Jet2.com flight, number 810, which was scheduled to depart at 18:25 on 26 October 2011 from Malaga to Manchester. The flight was subject to a 27-hour delay. On the inbound flight to Malaga the aircraft‚Äôs left engine fuel advisory light became illuminated, indicating a possible defect in the fuel shut-off valve. On landing, Jet2.com arranged for a spare valve to be fitted but the problem remained. It was not possible for the problem to be resolved before the airport shut for the evening. The following day engineers discovered a wiring defect in the fuel valve circuit which required repairing. As a result Jet2.com sent a specialist engineer and spare wiring from its hangar at Leeds Bradford airport. In the meantime Jet2.com decided to bring another aircraft from Glasgow to take passengers from Malaga to Manchester.http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/791.html Mr Huzar acted as litigant in person, issuing proceedings for compensation on behalf of himself, his wife and their granddaughter of ‚Ç¨400 each, under European Union (EU) Regulation 261/2004. Mr Huzar had initially referred his complaint to AESA, the Spanish National Enforcement Body, which ruled that his flight was claimable; however Jet2.com still refused compensation. History of the case On 20 December 2012 Mr Huzar commenced proceedings himself via the County Court Bulk Centre. Jet2.com instructed a firm of solicitors to act on its behalf and filed a defence citing extraordinary circumstances, specifically a left engine fuel valve problem which came to light during the previous flight. After troubleshooting it became apparent this was a wiring defect. On 10 June 2013http://www.bottonline.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/179933236-Jet2-appeal.pdf the matter was listed for a small claims hearing at Stockport County Court before Deputy District Judge Dignan. Mr Huzar acted as a litigant in person with Jet2.com represented by commercial law barristers. As part of his judgment Deputy Dignan commented :‚ÄúI accept it could be argued that a fault with the engine wiring is not an event which is not inherent in the normal exercise of the air carrier‚Äôs activities because the engine is part and parcel of the aeroplane, but the crux is, it goes on to say, ‚Äúand are beyond its actual control\\". ‚ÄúA gloss has been put on that by the case presented by Miss McCrea (sic) in her skeleton argument, Wallentin-Hermann v Alitalia,http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/legal_service/arrets/07c549_en.pdf and clearly that case has provided a basis for being able to argue that if there is a defect which could not have been revealed during ordinary flight maintenance and of itself is so exceptional that it could not have been detected in advance through maintenance and examination, and I am prepared to find that that sort of fault is beyond the control of the carrier, and therefore the exception to the regulations does apply in this case.\\" Deputy Dignan found in favour for Jet2.com and dismissed the claim. Mr Huzar then approached a firm of solicitors in the immediate aftermath of the hearing, which agreed to appeal on his behalf.http://www.bottonline.co.uk/aviation- latest-news/statement-on-jet2-application-to-the-supreme-court-to-appeal- huzar-decision On 27 June 2013 the appeal was filed at court on the grounds there had been a mistake as to the Application of the Law and undue prejudice to the claimant. The application relied on the case of Friederike Wallentin- Hermann v Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane SpA. Mr Huzar argued that this was a two part test ‚Äì that Jet2.com must show the defect was not inherent and that the defect was beyond its actual control. If one part of the test failed, compensation must be awarded. On 14 August 2013 permission to appeal was granted and the matter was listed for hearing before His Honour Judge Platts at Manchester County Court on 8 October 2013, with a time estimate of one day. This time both sides were represented by barristers. Jet2.com argued that in effect the test in Wallentin is actually one test, and that the court can effectively ask ‚Äòwas the event beyond the control of the air carrier?‚Äô. The Defendant also argued that events found outside of maintenance were extraordinary and that these events were unforeseen, unexpected and unpredictable. Mr Huzar argued that a technical problem as this, caused by wear and tear, is an event which is inherent in the normal running of an airline and whether it is unexpected is inutile. Furthermore, he argued the wear and tear affecting the aircraft is firmly within the air carrier‚Äôs actual control. In the absence of any external cause the technical problem must not be extraordinary. In paragraphs 27 and 28 of his judgment His Honour Judge Platts found:http://www.bottonline.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/179933236-Jet2-appeal.pdf ‚ÄúAgainst that background I am persuaded that in this case the cause of delay or cancellation was the need to resolve the technical problem which had been identified. That being the case, in my judgment it does not matter how the technical problem was identified. Whether it was identified by routine maintenance (as was the case in Wallentin) or as a result of a warning light during flight (as in the present case) seems to me to be irrelevant. Equally and for that very reason the fact that it was unexpected and unforeseeable is also irrelevant. The reality is that once a technical problem is identified it is inherent in the normal activity of the air carrier to have to resolve that technical problem. Further, the resolution of the problem, as was demonstrated in this case, is entirely within the control of the carrier. ‚ÄúOn such an analysis the delay caused by the resolution of an unexpected, unforeseen and unforeseeable technical problem cannot be said to be an extraordinary circumstance given the Wallentin test. Air carriers have to encounter and deal with such circumstances as part of running an airline just as the owner of a car has to encounter and deal with unexpected and unforeseen breakdowns of his car.‚Äù The appeal was successful and judgment was entered for Mr Huzar. Jet2.com applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on 11 November 2013. Application was made on the grounds that His Honour Judge Platts had erred in law on the grounds he had found the resolution of a technical defect to be inherent and in suggesting it was irrelevant how the problem was identified. The airline submitted that if a technical defect was found as a result of sabotage, terrorism or a manufacturing defect then it was an extraordinary circumstance as set out within the preamble to the Regulations. On 31 January 2014 the Lewison LJ granted leave to appeal, stating ‚ÄòThe grounds of appeal raise an important point of principle which, as the judge said ‚Äúdoes not admit to an easy answer‚Äù.‚Äô The matter was listed at Court 68 of the Royal Courts of Justice on 22 May 2014. Each party was represented by a Queen's Counsel (QC) before Lord Justice Law, Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice Gloster.http://www.bottonline.co.uk/articles/appeal-hearing-huzar-v-jet2-com Outcome At the end of the hearing on 22 May 2014 at the Royal Courts of Justice, the judges Law LJ, Elias LJ, and Gloster LJ reserved their judgment.http://www.bottonline.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2014/06/img-611094038-0001.pdf The judgment on 11 June 2014 was found in favour of Mr Huzar. Jet2.com requested to appeal against the rulinghttp://www.bottonline.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/179933236-Jet2-appeal.pdf but the Supreme Court refused its application to do so stating that: \\"[...]the application does not raise a point of law of general public importance and, in relation to the point of European Union law said to be raised by or in response to the application, it is not necessary to request the Court of Justice to give any ruling, because the Court's existing jurisprudence already provides sufficient answer.\\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/flight-delay-compensation-pay-tv- retailers-in-administration.html Significance On 13 June 2014 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) issued an apology to passengers who had previously sought its advice on flight delay or cancellation compensation. The authority confirmed that in future, all claims should be assessed in light of the Huzar v Jet2 ruling, adding: ‚ÄúClaims previously put to an airline can be reconsidered in the light of the judgement, if the passenger wishes, unless the passenger agreed a settlement with the airline.‚Äù Because of the landmark ruling, airlines are no longer able to claim that flight disruption caused by ordinary technical problems (such as wear and tear) are part of the extraordinary circumstances outlined in EU Regulation 261/2004. Figures from the CAA show that on average 221.1 million terminal passengers per year use British airports.http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=1279&pagetype;=90&pageid;=9793 According to statistics released by the European Commission an average of 1.5 percent of flights to/from British airports each year are delayed or cancelled by more than three hours and so could potentially be claimable.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52013SC0062 This is equivalent to approximately 3.27 million passengers per year for each of the previous six years, which is the period covered by the regulation in England and Wales (total 19.6 million passengers).

Access  There are three main access routes which lead to the summit of la Munia. The first, most direct and most frequented, runs along the impressive north face, in the vast cirque de Troumouse. The starting point is located at the Troumouse car park, at about 2,100 m. The ascent is a bit technical (PD), with two delicate passages : a first small wall (III-) that one needs to climb before arriving at the col de la Munia, then the cat's footstep (II) shortly before the summit ~ all this achieved in a spectacular high mountain landscape. After having reached the col de la Munia (at 2,853 m), the route leading to the summit is clear-cut, leading straight east, by a sharp ridge. The second starts south, in the Pineta valley at about 1,900 m. A path leads (without any major difficulty) to the col de la Munia, this time from the other side of the mountain. The ascent concludes the same way as the first route. The third, begins at Troumouse car park, but runs through the most eastern point of the cirque. The ascent is made along the crest, from east to west.

Plot Jack (Jason David Brown) is an average sewage worker who has been asked to investigate a water contamination in his hometown that has forced everyone else, including his pregnant wife Shelley (Molly Dunsworth), to evacuate. He decides to investigate the local sewage plant but ends up getting trapped in a septic tank by Lord Auch (Tim Burd) and his brother Giant (Robert Maillet).

The editor in chief of The World of the Bible is Beno√Æt de Sagazan since October 2008. Due to its editorial style, The World of the Bible is more appropriately called a review than a magazine. Its writers and contributors are often authorities in their disciplines, which vary from exegesis, history of religions, archeology, to art history. Established scholars, such as Thomas R√∂mer (professor at the Coll√®ge de France), Daniel Marguerat (University of Lausanne), Marie-Fran√ßoise Baslez (Sorbonne), Michel Quesnel (Catholic University of Lyon), Simon Claude Minouni (EPHE), R√©gis Burnet (UCLouvain), Bertrand Lafond (CNRS), Fran√ßois Brossier (professor emeritus at the Catholic Institute of Paris), and archeologist Estelle Villeneuve (Maison Ren√© Ginouv√®s of archeology and ethnology, Nanterre), preside over its editorial and scientific committee. The review publishes English and French e-books in the fields mentioned above. It maintains a partnership with Welt und Umwelt der Bibel in Germany and Il Mondo della Bibbia in Italy.

It is a condition in which one or more areas of the lung receive oxygen but no blood flow, or they receive blood flow but no oxygen due to some diseases and disorders. The V/Q ratio of a healthy lung is approximately equal to 0.8, as normal lungs are not perfectly matched.,Linda Physiology 5e by Linda Costanzo, PhD which means the rate of alveolar ventilation to the rate of pulmonary blood flow is roughly equal. The ventilation perfusion ratio can be measured by measuring the A-a gradient i.e. the alveolar-arterial gradient. __TOC__ Pathogenesis Consider some scenarios where there is a defect in ventilation and/ or perfusion of the lungs. In condition such as pulmonary embolism, the pulmonary blood flow is affected, thus the ventilation of the lung is adequate, however there is a perfusion defect with defect in blood flow. Gas exchange thus becomes highly inefficient leading to hypoxemia as measured by arterial oxygenation. A ventilation perfusion scan or lung scintigraphy shows some areas of lungs being ventilated but not adequately perfused. This also leads to a high A-a gradient which is not responsive to oxygen In conditions with right to left shunts, there is again a ventilation perfusion defect with high A-a gradient. However, the A-a gradient is responsive to oxygen therapy. In cases of right to left shunts more of deoxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood from the lungs and thus to a small extent the condition might neutralize the high A-a gradient with pure oxygen therapy. Patient with parenchymal lung diseases will have an increased A-a gradient with moderate response to oxygen therapy. A patient with hypoventilation will have complete response to 100% oxygen therapy Diagnosis : To check whether we are suffering from ventilation perfusion mismatch or not, we need to get a lung scan. It is a simple test to check ventilation and perfusion separately. If both scans are done simultaneously then it is called as V/Q scan. Ventilation Scan is done first as it is easy to wash out tracer gas from lungs with the help of hyperventilation than clearing the tracer radioactive material from blood. Indication - It is most commonly done in suspected case of pulmonary embolism. 1\\\\. Ventilation Scan- It usually takes 15 to 20 minutes. In this a radioactive tracer gas is inhaled and then this radioactive tracer gas is traced(looked) by taking pictures from specialised camera which capture the route and location of tracer gas. These pictures show us the part of lung devoid of tracer gas and then we correlate it with different types of lung pathology. How the test is performed - by using a mouth piece while closing nose with the help of clip, person is asked to inhale the radioactive tracer gas for few minutes and pictures are taken at regular intervals. Then person is asked to hold the breath and remain still for at least 10 seconds and final picture is taken. Then by looking upon the picture, the poorly ventilated or overvented area is noted. 2\\\\. Perfusion scan- It is done by injecting a radioactive tracer into a peripheral vein usually in arms and then following the path of tracer by camera as the tracer moves to lungs. It tells us about the area of lung poorly perused or any type of obstruction to the flow like in case of pulmonary embolism which will seen on image as an area devoid of tracer element distal to the obstruction. Results - 1\\\\. Ventilation Scan is abnormal but perfusion scan is normal indicating abnormal airway suggesting COPD or ASTHMA. 2\\\\. Ventilation Scan is normal but perfusion is abnormal indicating any obstruction to the blood flow (perfusion), may be because of the PULMONARY EMBOLISM obstructing the flow. 3\\\\. Both scans are abnormal. It may be found in PNEUMONIA or COPD. Results are reported in following way- 1\\\\. Normal - No abnormality found. 2\\\\. Low Probability - Chances of blood clot is low. Needs further and more testing. 3\\\\. Intermediate Probability - Scan shows possibility of blood clot. Needs more testing. 4\\\\. High Probability - High chances of clot. Needs treatment. Management Through ventilation and perfusion scans, the abnormal area of lung may be localized. A provisional diagnosis of COPD, asthma or pulmonary embolisms may be made. Treatment of these underlying conditions may address ventilation perfusion mismatch. Management of the condition may vary; if ventilation is abnormal or low, increasing the tidal volume or the rate may result in the poorly ventilated area receiving an adequate amount of air, which ultimately leads to an improved V/Q ratio. Conversely, if perfusion scan is of low quality showing low perfusion to lung as in case of hypovolemia, treatment of the conditions is by giving it fluid and using inotropes in case of shock.

Location The property is situated approximately north west of Doomadgee and west of Burketown. The homestead overlooks Settlement Creek. It has approximately of frontage onto the Gulf of Carpentaria. The property is bordered by the Pungalina-Seven Emu Sanctuary and Calvert Hills Station to the west, the Gulf of Carpentaria to the north, the Queensland border to the east and the Waanyi- Garawa Aboriginal Land Trust to the south. Description Several watercourses flow through the property including Branch Creek, Settlement Creek, Gold Creek and Running Creek. Wollogorang occupies an area of . and is able to carry more than 40,000 head of cattle. It contains the Wollogorang Important Bird Area. History The name Wollogorang in the local Indigenous Australian peoples language means Happy running waters, the name comes from Settlement Creek which runs through the property. The first Europeans to visit the area was the Ludwig Leichhardt expedition from Queensland to Port Essington in 1845. The lease for the landholding was established in 1881 by the Chisholm family who had come from Wollogorang house near Goulburn. Initially established and stocked in 1883 the property boasts the longest continuous occupation of any property in the Northern Territory as, unlike others, it has never been abandoned since it was first settled. The Anning family purchased the property in 1895 for ¬£3000 after the station manager, Harry Shadforth, had been speared by Aborigines. Copper was discovered on the property in 1899. The Annings sold the property in about 1906. In 2007 a Filipino worker, Pablo Balading, arrived in Australia on a 457 visa to commence work on Amungee Mungee Station. Instead he was taken to Wollogorang where he worked as a farm hand. Balading was harassed by his Australian workmates until he was killed when he fell from a vehicle speeding down a dirt road on the property. He died shortly afterward and his family was left without any compensation or information on to what had caused his death. The owner in 2006 was Paul Zlotkowskis who had placed it on the market for 40 million in 2008.

He studied at Buddhist English-Burmese School Thar Yawaddy, Tharyawaddy ABM and Insein High Schools respectively. Career He joined Dobama Asiayone and became a Thakin in 1935. He began to take part in peasant movements. In 1938, he became a member of the working committee of the All Burma Peasants Organization, a branch of Dobama Asiayone. At the same time, he was the secretary of All Burma Peasant Organization (Insein District). He participated actively in year 1300 revolution and also campaigned against the oppressive laws on peasants; for this he was arrested and imprisoned by the colonial British Government. In the 1942 Resistance Against the Japanese, he worked underground as a member for the People‚Äôs Revolution Party (PRP) (later become socialist party). On the formation of the Burma Independence Army (BIA), as a revolutionary leader of the Insein District, he took part in the administration of Insein District. Later, in the movement against British Occupation and the struggle for the independence, he worked closely with Thakin Tin, U Kyaw Nyein, Thakin Chit, U Ba Swe and Thakin Tin Tun. In May 1942, he attended BIA officer training school. On the transition of BIA to BDA (Burma Defence Army) he left the army. As an organizer in Insein District for Dobama Poor Man organization, he undertook secret organization for the resistance against the Japanese occupation, by communicating with Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Chit. In 1945, he was the political leader for Insein District and worked with Division 1, Min Hla Sithu Force. After the World War II, he took part in the formation of the Socialist Party. Later he became deputy secretary for the Socialist Party. In 1950, he became the General Secretary of the All Burma Peasants Organization. He was elected as a member of parliament in the 1947 election from Insein North. In 1950, he became the parliament secretary for Forestry and Agriculture Ministry. In 1952, he became Minister for the same department. From 1956 to 1960, he worked as the president of Economy and Trade Organization. In 1956, when U Nu resigned from Prime Minister Post to take up the president post of AFPFL Thakin Kyaw Tun also resigned from the minister post to work along with U Nu as the general secretary of AFPFL. Because of the differences among the leaders of AFPFL, the party split in 1958. Thakin Kyaw Tun became the general secretary of AFPFL (clean) faction which was led by U Nu and Thakin Tin. Thakin Kyaw Tun‚Äôs post as the minister for Forestry and Agriculture and Cooperatives and Good Distribution in the new AFPFL (clean) government lasted only for 3 month and 17 days, cut short by the first Coup de ta by the army in 1958. He did not participate in 1960 election, instead playing the role of general secretary of ‚ÄúUnion Party‚Äù, formerly the AFPFL (clean) party. During the split between ‚ÄúU-BO‚Äù and ‚ÄúThakin‚Äù fractions, Thakin Kyaw Tun led the Thakin Fraction. In 1964, he resigned from the Union Party and joined the Burmese Way to Socialist Party and in 1965 we worked as the president of Trade Corporation No. 6.

It buckles the Louron valley with its impressive silhouette It is located between the massifs of Monte Perdido and Posets.  Toponymy  Formerly named Grand Batchimale, it was renamed in honour of the mountaineer, cartographer, geographer and landscape painter Franz Schrader (1844-1924), who charted many mountains and valleys in the Pyrenees in the 19th century and who carried out its first known ascent on August 11, 1878, with the mountain guide Henri Passet. The name Batchimale is the name of the borderline crest of which it is the highest summit (there is also the Petit Batchimale). Franz Schrader quotes in his memoirs the term Pic P√©tard in the sense of Pic Tonnerre (\\"thunder\\").  Topography  It is located on the Franco-Spanish borderline crest between the Louron valley (Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es) and the Spanish Huesca province, which is also situated on the Pyrenean watershed.  History  On August 11, 1878, at 10:05, the first ascent was carried out by Franz Schrader, Henri Passet and a porter whose name is forgotten.  Access  Pic Schrader can be accessed from the French side through the valley of La Pez or from the refuge of La Soula. From the Spanish side, there are two itineraries, from the Viados refuge, following the western crest of la Punta del Sabre and, less frequented, passing by the Batchimale lakes.

It was carried out in the center of Warsaw by a unit of Kedyw, \\"Motor\\", which seized a transport car carrying the money. It was one of the best organized actions of the Polish underground during the German occupation, and it took only two minutes. The name of the action comes from the \\"G√≥ral\\", the popular name for the 500 z≈Çoty currency note (which were also known as \\"M≈Çynarki\\"). Polish historian Tomasz Strzembosz called this operation one of the most successful resistance operations in occupied Europe. History German bounty poster offering 5 million zloties for information about the perpetrators, defaced by Polish resistance with a note offering 10 million for information about potential robbery targets. Following the German invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, a large resistance network was formed. That resistance required funds to operate, and the resources of the Polish government in exile, delivered through the cichociemni commando-couriers, were limited. In 1942 the resistance began planning to acquire money from the occupiers by carrying out large-scale robberies. Having learned that a large quantity of money would be moved by the occupiers to the German-established Bank of Issue in Poland, the resistance recruited a number of sympathizers within the bank. Preparations lasted about 14 months. A cell, codenamed \\"Motor 30\\" from the Kedyw formation, led by operative \\"Pol\\", was assigned to the operation. The plan was to block the road at a specified location, shoot the German personnel attempting to clear it, and carry away the money. The action was initially planned for August 5, but a miscommunication resulted in the operation not being carried out. Fortunately for the insurgents, a new delivery was planned for the following week. The plan was carried out successfully, with the truck redirected into a small alley, all German personnel, including an escorting vehicle, quickly eliminated (according to one report, the Germans suffered nine fatalities and seven wounded; according to another, six killed and six wounded; only one of the Polish insurgents was wounded;), and the truck captured. Approximately 50 Polish insurgents took part in the operation, which lasted only about two minutes. The Polish insurgents obtained about 105‚Äì106 million z≈Çotys and a smaller amount of German currency, estimated to be worth about one million 1943 US dollars (approximately twenty million of 2010's USD). German investigation efforts, despite a large bounty for informants, failed to produce results, and the Germans were even not sure who had carried out the operations ‚Äì the insurgents or regular criminals, which led to no reprisals against the civilian population (an otherwise-common tactic used by the Germans to discourage resistance operations).

Her interests include exploring human evolution and spirituality from the perspective of integral feminism. She teaches in the fields of religion and gender studies, literature and academic writing practice at the University of Western Sydney and Notre Dame University, Sydney. She has been an honorary Postdoctoral Research Associate of Sydney University‚Äôs Department of Studies in Religion. and was an awardee of the Ian Potter Cultural Trust Fellowship for Literature. Career Joseph Campbell's work on the hero's journey was an early inspiration for Nicholson. She too was driven by the sense of curiosity and admiration about the purpose of living. She began researching women in mythology and religion, and from there explored the development of feminist spirituality from within the context of integral theory and human evolutionary development; following the heroine image of a woman from the ancient Archaic stage to the burgeoning Integral stage of human history. In her book The Evolutionary Journey of Woman: From the Goddess to Integral Feminism she discusses women's rich contribution to human evolutionary history, their oppression, and the integration of women's past wisdom with the full spectrum of present and future possibilities. =Integral theory and integral feminism= Nicholson was invited to speak on the topic of Integral Feminism at both of the two Integral Theory Conferences held at John F Kennedy University in California in 2008 and 2010. Her work on Integral Feminist theory has been published in the Journal of Integral Theory and Practice. Her book The Evolutionary Journey of Woman: from the Goddess to Integral Theory is published by Integral Publishers and is in part a critique of Ken Wilber's Sex, Ecology and Spirituality. She has an upcoming book Integral Voices on Sex, Gender and Spirituality with co- editor Vanessa Fisher through SUNY Press' Integral Theory series (under editor Sean Hargens).

In the game's 100 levels, the player interacts with different types of circles to bring a counter to the number 100. The game was developed and published by Semi Secret Software in collaboration with Greg Wohlwend and was released for iOS on January 7, 2013, and on Android later that year. It was originally built for the Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from staring at the ceiling, and Wohlwend applied a grayscale color palette from his first year in art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer. The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It was an honorable mention in Best Mobile Game and Nuovo Award categories of the 2012 Independent Games Festival, their honorable mention in Excellence in Visual Art the next year, and an official selection at IndieCade 2012. Reviewers praised its minimalist design aesthetic and puzzle variety, and criticized its obtuse cryptography subgame. Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a design object, a feat unique for the video game medium.  Gameplay  Players touch circles onscreen to make them grow in size. Numbers within the circles count upwards with the duration of the touch. If a growing circle overlaps another, the player must restart the puzzle. Levels are completed when the numbers within the circles total 100. There are 100 levels that progress in complexity from a simple circle with no nearby obstructions to the advanced mechanics, such as linked circles that need to be touched at once, buzzsaws that reset the numbers within the circles, and snowflakes that freeze other circles. The game has no pause feature or motion controls, and there is no formal tutorial. Hidden between the puzzles are a few ciphers‚Äîincomprehensible text to be decoded through substitution cipher and other methods. The endless mode unlocks when the 100 puzzles are complete, and features a series of randomly generated levels.  Development  Hundreds is a puzzle game developed and published by Semi Secret Software: Adam Saltsman of Canabalt, Greg Wohlwend of Puzzlejuice, composer Scott Morgan (also known as Loscil), and developer Eric Johnson. Wohlwend originally built Hundreds as a Flash game. As an artist, he wanted to experiment with game programming following his release of Solipskier with programmer Mike Boxleiter. He developed the game from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling, where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing. He found this to be a good core game concept and based the game around \\"patience and persistence\\". The game's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school, where Wohlwend composed in black, white, and red so as to focus on composition rather than color. The Flash version was released in 2010 and is available online at Newgrounds. The Flash version was much simpler in design, and added circles onscreen as the game progressed. This gameplay evolved into what became the iOS release. Though Wohlwend describes his interest in \\"simple and elegant\\" game design as permeating his works, Hundreds minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming. The code was \\"brute forced\\" and written in a single file. It was the first game he programmed, though he had some assistance with the in-game physics. Wohlwend wanted the game to be purchased by a Flash game site like Kongregate or Newgrounds. When the sites were not interested, he chose to open source his code, partly with the intent to spur \\"non-coders\\" to try coding, as he had. At the time, Semi Secret Software was in a lull between projects. Programmer Eric Johnson of Semi Secret found the open source version and ported the game to iPad in a weekend before notifying Wohlwend. At the time, Wohlwend did not have an iOS device to test the port, and had to purchase an iPad. Johnson's iPad version spurred Wohlwend to consider how Hundreds would work with multitouch and cooperative play, and Semi Secret's Adam Saltsman to consider a Hundreds collaboration, especially as the company lacked the funds to work on a new game from scratch. They began to work towards an iOS release. Saltsman expected Wohlwend to work with Johnson to finish the game in a few months by adding new \\"circle types\\" and designing 100 discrete puzzles, but extended that estimate and joined the project himself in that time. Wohlwend and Saltsman extended the game's mechanics with new circles and puzzles, but their results were clunky. Saltsman recalled wanting to add atop the game's \\"basic building blocks\\", which took them off-track after a few months and took a few additional months to recover. Wohlwend wanted to make the game easier than the Flash version and so proposed ten new circles that were not adopted. However, he was happy with the final result and credited the game's \\"emergent interaction\\" qualities to Saltsman. They built on each other's level designs, though Wohlwend said that Saltsman made \\"basically all the levels\\". The new team enjoyed working with each other. The core differences between the Flash and iOS versions are a new endless mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and codes. The latter feature spiraled from email conversations between Wohlwend and Saltsman about a \\"really obtuse and weird\\" subgame that functioned as a story. Wohlwend credited Saltsman with the idea of a Brave New World-style fiction within the game that used ciphers, though the idea was also influenced by a similar plot element in Dash Shaw's Bottomless Belly Button. The endless mode was added about six months into development. They hoped the game's presentation conveyed \\"honest and confident rather than overly mysterious and weird\\". The team was also inspired by Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP boldness. Hundreds was first announced at the 2012 Game Developers Conference and \\"reannounced\\" later that year following changes in its presentation. It was released on January 7, 2013 for iPhone and iPad, and on June 28 for Android. It was later added to the November 2013 Humble Mobile Bundle 3. The composer released a compilation of remixes of the Hundreds track as 100 Minutes on Bandcamp in June 2013.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It was an honorable mention in Best Mobile Game and Nuovo Award categories of the 2012 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival, and an honorable mention in Excellence in Visual Art at the 2013 festival. Hundreds was also an official selection at IndieCade 2012. Reviewers noted the game's unadorned nature. Edge called it \\"handsomely austere\\", \\"modish\\", and \\"elegant\\". Dan Ryckert of Game Informer complimented its simplicity, and The Guardian Stuart Dredge found the game's minimalism \\"stylish\\" and its gameplay \\"genuinely hypnotic\\". Eurogamer Dan Whitehead said the game was \\"basically interactive porn for graphic designers\\". Nissa Campbell from TouchArcade wrote that its red, gray, and black graphics were \\"striking\\" albeit not flashy, and that the game was interesting \\"visually, aurally, and mechanically\\". In a piece for The Atlantic, Ian Bogost wrote that its game, visual, and interaction design \\"embodied an elegant minimalism\\" akin to the Bauhausian aesthetic promoted by Apple. He added that Hundreds had cultural cachet \\"unprecedented\\" in the medium of video games and similar to that of other design objects‚Äîthat the game was closer to Prada or a lobby bar than to Angry Birds. Bogost felt that it required an amount of attention unlike other \\"time- waster\\" mobile games, and referred to the precarious strategies required to complete some levels as a \\"multi-touch ballet\\". Edge thought the game to be \\"an astoundingly harmonious mix of art and design\\" and said its \\"simple premise\\" is \\"perfectly suited for a multitouch screen\\". The magazine noted that the game occasionally becomes one of patience and not skill due to the degree of entropy in each level. Dan Ryckert of Game Informer noted Hundreds as one of the better examples of games that successfully \\"embraced the simplicity of touch control\\", such that translation to traditional controller would be \\"virtually impossible\\". He appreciated the way the game slowly introduced the new circle types, though he did not like how his hand occasionally obscured the screen. (For this reason, reviewers preferred the iPad version for its larger screen.) Multiple reviewers liked how the game continually renewed itself with the slow introduction of new game elements, though Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer described the core gameplay as \\"one-note\\" and criticized its lack of addictive loops that keep players interested. Mike Rose of Gamasutra compared the game as the inverse of Jezzball. Multiple reviewers noted Hundreds variety of puzzles and endgame difficulty. Edge commented that the \\"arcane codes\\" and puzzles with prescribed solutions made the game's pacing \\"unusual\\" when compared to the other puzzles designed to be completed leisurely. Slater of Pocket Gamer too felt the pacing was \\"swift but uninspiring\\", and Eurogamer Whitehead called its rhythm \\"weird\\" as he waited for the right opportunity some puzzles and could finish others with a single trick. Game Informer Ryckert also found the final puzzles too aggravating, especially the ones with invisible elements. Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the variety of puzzles from \\"twitch\\" to \\"slow and thoughtful\\" to, her favorite, the \\"cerebral\\" puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles. She also found the last level nigh impossible. Multiple reviewers felt that the cipher puzzles were out of place, and TouchArcade said it was easy to ignore them as what felt like an \\"utterly distinct\\" game. The Atlantic Bogost thought that the hidden ciphers were the \\"surest clue\\" of its status as \\"a design object and not a consumable media experience\\". Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the ciphers felt forced and unexciting, and was disappointed overall in consideration of \\"the incredible talent involved\\". Whitehead of Eurogamer called the puzzles \\"deftly constructed\\" and said the game \\"delights more than it frustrates\\". Wired Ryan Rigney wrote that Hundreds distinguished itself among iOS puzzle games in its style and design.

Since he assumed he would be arrested there (possibly warned by Nikolai Yezhov), Uspensky deserted on November 14, 1938, faked his own suicide and took refuge in the Ural Mountains. However, he was tracked down and arrested on April 15, 1939. On January 27, 1940, he was sentenced to death and executed the next day.

The circular instructs marriage registrars to register Muslim marriages even if the parties have not attained the age fixed by the Child Marriage Act. Political parties and Muslim women's organisations have said that this would encourage child marriages. Following an amendment, only underage marriages occurring before 28June 2013 could be registered. Nine prominent Muslim organisations in Kerala took legal action seeking exemption from the community marriage-age restrictions, saying that the minimum marriage age for women (fixed at 18 by the Child Marriage Act) as well as its Supreme Court endorsement infringe on the Muslim law. Background The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) opposes the Child Marriage Act on the grounds that it contravenes the Muslim personal law. According to a survey by the Integrated Child Development Scheme, of the 3,400 girls aged 13 to 18 married in Malappuram, Kerala in 2012, 2,800 were Muslims. In 2008, 4,249 of the 4,955 brides in child marriages were Muslims. Although most Muslim religious organisations and clerics have defended the government circular, Muslim women have opposed it. Examples A 28-year-old United Arab Emirates (UAE) citizen, Jasem Mohammed Abdul Karim Abdulahmed, married a 17-year-old girl from an orphanage in Malappuram on 13June 2013. He left the country after two weeks, divorcing her by telephone with a triple talaq. Outrage over child marriage is believed to have been triggered by this incident, and the Kerala High Court later halted the marriage of a 14-year-old girl from Kannur. Film Aryadan Shoukath's film on the topic, Paadam Onnu: Oru Vilapam, received national acclaim. Opposition The Students' Federation of India organised meetings at colleges across the state to protest the move by Muslim organisations to legally challenge the minimum age of marriage, demonstrating their opposition by wearing gags. Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said that the IUML was trying to polarise the community to influence Lok Sabha elections and deny educational rights to Muslim girls by lowering their marriageable age. Opposition leader and former Chief Minister of Kerala V. S. Achuthanandan condemned the move by some Muslim organisations to reduce the marriageable age of Muslim girls, and the Kerala Women‚Äôs Commission has also condemned child marriage.

He lives in Tourinnes-la-Grosse, in Walloon Brabant (Belgium). One of his acting roles was the \\"father Jacques\\" in The Mystery of the Yellow Room and . Beaucarne's first single was recorded in 1964. He has produced multiple albums since then.  Biography  In 1964, he recorded his first single and its first LP Julos chante Julos came out in 1967. Since then, he produced about one album every two years. These include L'enfant qui veut vider la mer (1968), Julos chante pour vous (1969), Chandeleur 75 (1975), Les communiqu√©s colombophiles (1976), Julos au Th√©√¢tre de la ville (1977), La p'tite gayole (1981), Chansons d'amour (2002), a double album with Barbara Alcantara given to the farm of Wahenge, site of the post-industrial pagodas near the village where he lives, and two CDs where he sings poems he set to music. These albums range from song collages, recited poems, humorous monologues, to \\"catch-up sounds and voice clips\\". Each album is thus an atmosphere more than a concept, which reflects a state of mind mixing revolt (lettre √† Kissinger, Bosnia and Herzegovina), tenderness (Y Vaut Meyeu S'b√™tchi), humor (Pompes fun√®bres) and everyday life, as his neighbor's voice in the \\"communiqu√©s colombophiles\\" (pigeon releases). He refuses stardom, has his own publishing house, records and books (Publishing Louise-H√©l√®ne France). He continues to live in his village of Tourinnes-la-Grosse in Wallonia and talks by himself on the forum of his website. The murder of his wife Loulou (Louise-H√©l√®ne France) at Candlemas in 1975, changed his style to a more humanist one. That night he wrote an open letter analyzing the guilt of the society that put the weapon in the hands of assassins, along with a call to \\"reforest the human soul\\" with \\"love, friendship and persuasion\\". After this tragedy, he traveled, particularly in Quebec and he strengthened his ties with French speakers' singers culture. At the death of King Baudouin, he was chosen as a symbol of the Belgian people to sing a tribute to the late king. He was knighted in July 2002 by King Albert II. He also signed the Manifesto for Walloon culture in 1983. He puts poems into songs, from Belgian authors (especiallyMax Elskamp) or non-Belgian, which gave birth to the songs \\"Je ne songeais pas √† Rose\\" (Victor Hugo), \\"Je fais souvent ce r√™ve √©trange\\" (Paul Verlaine). He played the \\"father Jacques\\" in The Mystery of the Yellow Room and '. In 2012, he played the role of father of Prudence in Associ√©s contre le crime Pascal Thomas, Catherine Frot and Dussollier.

Stage 1 opened in September 2020. Stage 1 is 11.34 km in length and will connect the Bruce Highway to the south of Mackay (at Stockroute Road) with the Bruce Highway to the north of Mackay (near Bald Hill Road). It will involve a new bridge over the Pioneer River and an interchange with the Peak Downs Highway. It aims to provide a bypass of Mackay for Bruce Highway traffic that is immune to flooding and free of signalised intersections. Stage 1 of the project is expected to cost $540 million, 80% of the funding is from the Commonwealth and the remaining 20% from Queensland. Stage 2 is 8.2 km in length. It will connect Stage 1 near the Bruce Highway at Glenella to Harbour Road at Mackay Harbour. The route will follow the Mackay Harbour Railway (Port Rail Line). Stage 3 is 1.4 km in length. An additional connection from Stage 2 to the Port and Slade Point Road. It is expected that many vehicles will bypass the city once completed.

Prandtl condition-in Normal Shock In the case of normal shock, flow is assumed to be in a steady state and thickness of shock is very small. It is further assumed that there is no friction or heat loss at the shock (because heat transfer is negligible because it occurs on a relatively small surface). It is customary in this field to denote x as the upstream and y as the downstream condition. Since the mass flow rate from the two sides of the shock are constant, the mass balance becomes, \\\\rho_{x}.U_{x}=\\\\rho_{y}.U_{y} As there is no external force applied , momentum is conserved .Which give rises to the equation P_{x}-P_{y}=\\\\rho_{x}.U_{x}^2-\\\\rho_{y}.U{y}^2 Because heat flow is negligible, the process can be treated as adiabatic. So the energy equation will be C_{p}.T_{x}+\\\\frac{U_{x}^2}{2}=C_{p}.T_{y}+\\\\frac{U_{y}^2}{2} From the equation of state for perfect gas, P=œÅRT As the temperature from both sides of the shock wave is discontinues, the speed of sound is different in these adjoining medium. So it is convenient to define the star mach number that will be independent of the specific mach number.

Crowned Miss Germany of 1957, she is probably most famous for being the girl who many thought should have won the scandal- plagued 1957 Miss Universe contest but didn't. Scandal-plagued Miss Universe Pageant The 1957 Miss Universe Pageant was beset by a number of serious scandals, not just the judges' failure to select Miss Germany, the popular favorite, as Miss Universe. =Daub appears unbeatable= Daub, a 19-year-old, 5' 6¬Ω\\" green-eyed blonde from Hamburg, was crowned Miss Hamburg in May, 1957. The next month she won the Miss Germany title and just four days later placed third in the Miss Europe competition. There she was chosen \\"Miss Photogenic Europe.\\" Soon after she became Miss Germany, the press started calling her \\"Grace Kelly\\" because of her strong resemblance to the beautiful American movie star. Next came the Miss Universe Pageant in Long Beach, California. Opening ceremonies were Saturday, 13 July 1957, followed by the Miss Universe Parade on Sunday, after which Daub was again voted \\"Miss Photogenic\\" by members of the international press corps covering the Pageant. By Tuesday, Daub was clearly the favorite of both the media and the public and the next morning's Los Angeles Times would describe her as \\"a virtually perfect 19-year-old blonde, who is becoming a favorite to win the Miss Universe crown.\\" Another Times article would refer to her as \\"the exquisitely beautiful Miss Germany.\\" The press soon came up with another nickname for Daub -- \\"Germany's Blonde Venus.\\" The Austin Daily Herald would refer to her as \\"the breath-takingly beautiful Gerti Daub.\\" The Los Angeles Herald-Express would call her \\"the almost unanimous choice of television viewers and press photographers.\\" Another article in the same paper would say, \\"Germany's entrant in the lavish spectacle, blonde, delicate Gerti Daub seemed an overwhelming favorite.\\" On Thursday when the 15 semi-finalists gave their speeches, Daub clearly received the most applause. =Crowd doesn't agree with judges= It was in such an atmosphere that Pageant emcee Ed Hennessy had the unenviable task of introducing Daub as the fourth runner-up during Friday night's selection of Miss Universe. His announcement drew such sustained booing and hissing from the 4,000-member audience that he finally told the crowd: \\"Thank you. That's democracy. It's not very nice democracy, but it's democracy.\\" The Times would report: \\"Obviously the favorite of the packed [Long Beach Municipal] auditorium, Miss Germany's introduction as the fourth runner-up drew spontaneous boos from the audience to the extent that Ed Hennessy, the master of ceremonies, had to remonstrate with the crowd.\\" Subsequently, so little applause greeted announcement of the fourth-, third-, and second-place finishers, Hennessy would ask each time for more applause, stressing how important that particular award was. And just before introducing Miss Peru, Gladys Zender, as the new Miss Universe, he even made a plea to the audience: \\"I hope that we've heard for this year the last boo....\\" The public was so upset with the judges' snub of Miss Germany that the telephone switchboard at KTTV, the Los Angeles TV station carrying the Pageant, was flooded with angry callers. The same was true at the Los Angeles Times which then owned KTTV. The next day, the Herald-Express's front-page headline didn't tell who'd won the title, instead it read: \\"HISS, BOO BEAUTY JUDGES\\", with a subheading \\"Fans of Germany Entrant in Protest.\\" =Viewers question legitimacy of pageant= The legitimacy of the contest, itself, was called into question by viewers. One caller said, \\"From Miss Maryland on down the whole contest was a fake.\\" (This was a reference to the fact that earlier that day, Leona Gage of Maryland had been stripped of the Miss USA title after she admitted she was married, a violation of Pageant rules. Actually she had been married twice and had two children.) A different caller stated, \\"Miss Germany stood an all-out winner. I'm so disgusted I'll never look at another Miss Universe contest again.\\" \\"Miss Germany should have won hands down\\", claimed yet another. And with Latin Americans winning three of the top five places, a caller complained, \\"We can't have strictly objective judging when four judges are from Latin America.\\" =Other contestants fault judges= The International News Service (INS) reported that many of the other contestants \\"grumbled that blonde Gerti Daub (Miss Germany) should have won and most of them complained about the judging.\\" Even Zender said Gerti should have won. And Miss Morocco, Jacqueline Bonilla, stated most emphatically that Daub should have been the victor: \\"Zee judges, zey don't understand. Miss Germany should have won\\", she explained. \\"Anyone could see that she was the winner.\\" Bonilla also said that the judges \\"...are too stern and make a girl like me shake in the boots.\\" =Judges defend their vote= The nine Miss Universe judges would defend their choice of Miss Peru over Miss Germany, claiming their decision had nothing to do with the presence of four Latin Americans on the panel. In addition to a Venezuelan, there was a Peruvian, a Brazilian, and a Cuban; Miss Peru won, Miss Brazil finished second, and Miss Cuba fourth. (Altogether there were five Latin judges, but the judge from Argentina was unable to continue and was replaced by the Brazilian.) Just the year before, the then-Miss Peru had led a brief sit-down strike when not one of the Latin American entries was chosen as a finalist. Some claimed the Pageant was now paying back the Latin Americans for previous slights. Popular columnist Earl Wilson, a judge, would say, \\"We really struggled with the decision. It ought to be good for our relations down south.\\" Chief Judge Vincent Trotta of New York City defended his judges by saying \\"Miss Germany had a very beautiful face\\", but did not measure up to the first three winners on other scores. \\"A 'statuesque figure,'\\" he said, \\"counts mainly in every judges mind. And that's the way I instruct my judges.\\" Zender was 1.4\\" larger in the bust (36.0\\"-34.6\\"), but also 2.3\\" larger in the waist (23.6\\"-21.3\\") than Daub. Hip measurements were virtually the same, with Zender 0.2\\" smaller (36.0\\"-36.2\\"). So which figure is the more statuesque? Statuesque is a subjective quality. And it is culturally dependent. Apparently the judges felt a larger chest measurement constituted \\"more statuesque\\", whereas one newspaper account referred to the smaller Daub as \\"delicate.\\" =Daub says nothing= Miss Germany said nothing about the judges' decision, but was later seen crying. \\"I am homesick\\", she sobbed. \\"Everyone seems to have friends and family but I have no one.\\" She had also shed a few tears earlier when happy after being selected as one of the 15 semifinalists. =Long Beach paper says almost nothing= The next morning's edition of the Long Beach newspaper, the Independent (a sponsor of the Miss Universe Pageant), skipped over all the booing, the delays it caused, and the many unhappy-viewer phone calls, and merely stated: \\"When the fifth-place winner, Miss Germany, was announced, an audible sigh of disappointment rose from the crowd.\\" =More scandals= More scandals would rock the 1957 Miss Universe Pageant. Miss Zender was not actually 18 years old as required by Pageant rules, but several months short of 18. Pageant officials allowed her to keep the title after being convinced by Zender's representatives and others that, in Peru, someone who reaches 17 years, 7 months is considered to be 18. Officials would also learn that Miss England, Sonia Hamilton, was already 25 years old which put her over the Pageant's age limit (under 25). In addition, her real name was Cynthia Cooper and her parents were Australian not British. Finally, when the Miss USA crown was taken away from Leona Gage, Charlotte Sheffield, Miss Utah, who had come in second, assumed the Miss USA title. However, since she had already missed the first night's judging for Miss Universe, Pageant officials ruled she was not eligible to participate for that title. Titles Gerti Daub didn't become Miss Universe, but racked up a number of other titles, official and otherwise: Miss Hamburg, Miss Germany, Miss Photogenic Europe, Miss Photogenic (Miss Universe), \\"Grace Kelly\\", and \\"Germany's Blonde Venus\\". Daub acquired yet another \\"title of sorts\\" back when the Mayor of Baden-Baden congratulated her upon winning the Miss Germany title in his city. He wanted to kiss Daub on the mouth, but she turned to the side. The Frankfurt evening newspaper then ran the headline, \\"Miss Germany was a fridge.\\" Daub explained that she didn't just kiss everyone. Life after the Miss Universe pageant After becoming Miss Hamburg, Daub had been asked by famous German actor and singer Hans Albers to appear in his movie Das Herz von St. Pauli (The Heart of St. Pauli). She accepted and said it was a great experience, but she didn't think she was a good actress. A few days after Daub returned home to Hamburg following the Miss Universe Pageant, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offered her $250,000 to make a movie. Maria Schell, Curt Jurgens, Yul Brenner, and Sammy Davis, Jr. all tried to convince her to do it. An MGM agent even came to Hamburg several times trying to persuade her. Daub declined, saying she was not a good actress and did not seek a film career. \\"The line of bad actresses is long enough\\", she said. The head of MGM told her he'd never had such a refusal in his entire life. Daub, however, explained that many actresses fail, but she \\"knew what she had\\" at the beauty salon she owned in Hamburg. Also, as Miss Germany she had a nearly 12-month commitment to various sponsors to travel and promote their products. Daub would later say she never would have guessed how much hard work being Miss Germany actually entailed. It involved long days after little sleep, with first a press conference, followed by signing autographs, going to sales events, and then nightly VIP invitations. The next day would be the same, only in a different city. =Highest honor and greatest happiness= Daub says that the highest honor for her was being the only Miss Germany to be received by Pope Pius XII in a private audience. And the greatest happiness of her Miss Germany time? Meeting her husband, Carlheinz Hollmann, when the journalist and television host interviewed her after she returned from a one- month trip to South America early in 1958. Daub would marry Hollmann on 1 December 1958, and the pair would have two children, Nils (an advertising salesman) and Nicole (a photographer). On 4 May 2004, she would lose Hollmann (73) to cancer after a happy marriage of more than 47 years. After 57 years Daub reveals what actually happened \\"Behind the Curtain\\" Daub's disclosure, \\"Behind the Curtain\\", exactly as she wrote it in English: > Behind the Curtain In 2014, 57 years after my so very special year 1957, I > want to tell for the first time what happened behind the curtain and why I > wept: After many days in Long Beach/California, which were filled with > parades, elections and tasks, shows, presentations, cocktail parties and > charity events; came the day of decision.

Then already I heard the announcement: \\"Fourth runner- > up is Miss Germany, Gerti Daub\\"! I had no time to pull myself together and > had no chance to calm down a little.

Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, CPTPP, G-20 major economies, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations.  History  = Early history = Under Spanish colonial rule, Mexico, then known as New Spain, controlled the trade routes between Manila, capital of the Philippines and the Mexican port of Acapulco. Through this trade route, Spanish galleons sailed from Acapulco to the Philippines and traded with neighboring countries/territories within the vicinity. Some of those territories were the islands of Japan. In Manila, Japanese trading boats would arrive and bring goods and food to trade with the New Spanish government.Bilateral relations between Japan and Mexico (in Spanish) From Manila, Spanish vessels would transport the goods back to Acapulco, traverse the Mexican terrain until they reached the port of Veracruz and from there transport the goods onto another Spanish vessel to Spain. In the mid-1500, Spanish Jesuits, many of them born in New Spain, began to arrive to Japan to preach Christianity. In 1597, general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who is accredited with uniting the islands of Japan; prohibited the teaching of Christianity and ordered all missionaries to leave Japan. Several Jesuits did not leave and they were executed in Nagasaki.History of Mexico and Japan (in Spanish) San Juan Bautista ship docked in Acapulco bay in 1614 In 1609, a Spanish galleon called San Francisco capsized near ≈åtaki, Chiba while making its way from Manila to Acapulco. 370 castaways were rescued by Japanese fisherman. Among those rescued was the New Spanish governor of the Philippines; Rodrigo de Vivero. In Japan, de Vivero was able to travel to Tokyo and met with high level dignitaries and establish direct commercial relations between Japan and the Spanish empire via the Philippines. After spending some time travelling throughout the Japanese islands, de Vivero returned to Acapulco with a new ship built in Japan called the San Buenaventura and with some Japanese men on board. Once in Acapulco, de Vivero brought his mission to Mexico City and met with the Spanish viceroy, Luis de Velazco and communicated to him his report. In March 1611, the Spanish viceroy Veleazco sent a mission directly from Acapulco to Japan thanking the Japanese government for assisting his governor de Vivero and reimbursed them for the ship San Buenaventura, and giving them gifts in homage, one of them being a clock made in Madrid and it was to be the first clock that people of Japan had ever seen before. The Japanese Navy visiting Mexico in 1900. In October 1613, the first Japanese diplomatic mission was sent to New Spain by Masamune Date, a regional strongman. This diplomatic mission was to be known as the Keich≈ç embassy and it was the second diplomatic mission to travel to Europe after the first historic mission known as the Tensh≈ç embassy. Date had built a new exploration ship called the Date Maru or San Juan Bautista which was to take the diplomatic party to the Americas. The ambassador, Hasekura Tsunenaga traveled from Japan to Acapulco and met with the Spanish viceroy Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. In Mexico City, Hasekura met with several colonial leaders and offered the New Spanish government free commerce between the New Spanish territories and Japan and asked for a group of Christian missionaries to return to Japan. The diplomatic mission also offered to expel both English and Dutch citizens from the country because both nations were considered at the time to be enemies of the Spanish king. In June 1614, Hasekura left New Spain via Veracruz and continued on his journey to Spain to meet with the Spanish king leaving behind a small delegation. In Spain, Hasekura was baptized a catholic and changed his name to Francisco Felipe Faxicura. Two years later in February 1617, Hasekura/Faxicura returned from Spain to Veracruz and traveled to Mexico City. Upon arrival to Mexico City, Hasekura was surprised to see that most members of his delegation that he had left behind, had married and integrated into the local community. In 1618, Hasekura and his diplomatic mission set sail and returned to Japan. On arrival, they were confronted with the fact the country had dramatically changed since their departure in 1613 and that anything related to Christianity had been banned. Hasekura and his delegation had to renounce their adopted religion. Since Hasekura's diplomatic mission to New Spain, Japan entered a time of isolation and refused to trade with foreign nations. Birthplace Monument of Traffic and Friendship between Japan, Spain and Mexico in Onjuku, Japan After the Meiji Restoration, in which the Empire of Japan officially reestablished diplomatic relations with various governments of the world, in Mexico arose interest to initiate official relations with the Empire of Japan. The expedition from Mexico to Japan in 1874, led by the Mexican scientist Francisco D√≠az Covarrubias, was the reason why formal attempts were made between representatives of the governments of both countries to have diplomatic relations. At the end of Diaz Covarrubias' report, such action was recommended. In 1874 (fifty-three years after Mexico declared independence from Spain in 1821), a Mexican scientific delegation headed by Francisco D√≠az Covarrubias arrived in Japan to witness the transit of the planet Venus through a solar disc. Although the scientific delegation did not have much success, this mission did allow for formal diplomatic relations to begin between the two nations. In 1888 Foreign Ministers Mat√≠as Romero and Munemitsu Mutsu signed a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation; which was to be Japan's first \\"equal\\" treaty with a foreign nation and thus formally established diplomatic relations between the two nations.Japan-Mexico Relations (Basic Data) = World War II and post-war relations = Since establishing diplomatic relations, contact between the two nations increased through trade and commerce. In May 1942, Mexico declared war on the Axis Powers, which included Japan, and joined World War II. The Escuadr√≥n 201 was a squadron of fighter planes that fought against Japanese pilots at the Battle of Luzon, in the Philippines. After the war, diplomatic relations were restored and have continued unabated ever since. The fact that Mexico agreed to sign a more just treaty in the context of agreements reached by other countries and not Japan was a grateful fact for that country and that the location of the Mexican embassy in Tokyo has a location Unique and central, just next to the Official Residence of the Prime Minister in the heart of the Japanese capital, in an area reserved for the room of senior rulers of the country, where it remainsMario M., Miyoshi (Abril, mayo y junio de 2016). \\"La embajada de M√©xico en Jap√≥n.

He made an important contribution to the mapping of the Pyrenees and was highly considered among the pyreneists.  Biography  He was the son of Prussian Ferdinand Schrader from Magdeburg, who emigrated to Bordeaux, and of Marie- Louise Ducos, from a family of N√©rac, and cousin of geographers √âlis√©e and On√©sime Reclus. He showed a talent for drawing from an early age. But his strict father, denying him the opportunity of higher education, placed him as a pen pusher at a tax gatherer. Franz then found another job in a trading house run by one of his father's friends, a situation where he could devote more time to broadening his literary and scientific knowledge.

In 1866, while staying with his friend L√©once Lourde-Rocheblave in Pau, he had a sort of revelation at the spectacle grandiose de la barri√®re montagneuse of the Pyrenees. His vocation strengthened when reading stories by Ramond de Carbonni√®res (1755‚Äì1827) (Les Voyages au Mont-Perdu - Travels to Monte Perdido) and by Henry Russell (1834‚Äì1909) (Les Grandes Ascensions des Pyr√©n√©es, guide d'une mer √† l'autre - Great ascents of the Pyrenees, a guide from one sea to the other). While devoting the main part of his leisure to long hikes in the mountains, during which he gathered thousands of observations for his topographical records, he still found time to paint numerous panoramas of the Pyrenees as well as the Alps which he also studied, H√©l√®ne Saule-Sorb√©, Michel Rodes, Guy Auriol.

While Schrader scoured the Pyrenees with his friend Lourde-Rocheblave, he also acquired a strong background in cartography with the aim of applying it to a large scale map of the nearby Pyrenees. To facilitate topographical work in rugged terrain, he developed the orograph in 1873. His first great cartographic work, in 1874, was the map of the massif of Gavarnie-Mont-Perdu at a scale of 1:40 000, for which he collected the measurements with the participation of Lourde- Rocheblave from nearby Pau. That map triggered such a sensation that it was included in the annual M√©moires of the Soci√©t√© des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles of Bordeaux with an explanatory text the following year. The Club alpin fran√ßais directory followed with the publication of an enthusiastic review, describing Schrader as qualified for \\"first rank topographer in a glorious master stroke\\". In 1876 he took part in the creation of the Bordeaux section of the Club Alpin Fran√ßais, becoming its first president. In 1877 he traveled to Paris with a recommendation from his cousins √âlis√©e and On√©sime Reclus. There, having met √âmile Templier, nephew and collaborator of Louis Hachette, and Adolphe Joanne, president of the Parisian section of the Club Alpin Fran√ßais, he was employed as a geographer by Librairie Hachette and was able to practice his passion in the scope of his profession. He also gave geography lessons at the School of Anthropology, and became editor of the French Alpine Club directory. On August 11, 1878, accompanied by high-mountain guide Henri Passet, he carried out the first known ascension of the Grand Batchimale (3,176 m), consequently renamed pic Schrader. In 1880, he was promoted director of cartography for Hachette and aimed at surpassing in quality the Stieler Atlas, by German Adolf Stieler. On November 25, 1897, as vice-president of the C.A.F. he convened a conference at the Club Alpin which constituted his true esthetic credo of the mountain and in which he announced the imminent foundation of a French school of mountain painting. The conference text title was : √Ä quoi tient la beaut√© des montagnes (What makes the beauty of mountains); this speech is considered as the birth bulletin of la Soci√©t√© des peintres de montagneSoci√©t√© des peintres de montagne. (Paris) and its text is reproduced in 1898 in the Club Alpin Fran√ßais directory. From 1901 to 1904, he presided over le Club Alpin Fran√ßais. He also actively contributed to the Guides Joanne of the Librairie Hachette, which in 1919 became the Guides bleus. The scientific commission created by Franz Schrader in the Club Alpin Fran√ßais still exists today, as well as the Soci√©t√© des Peintres de Montagne. He died in Paris in 1924. In 1927 his remains were transferred to a tomb on a slope of the cirque de Gavarnie.  The orograph  Model of orograph built in 1885 upon Schrader's directivesFranz Schrader, Pyr√©n√©es, Tome II, coll. Science et Art, Ed. Privat, Toulouse, 1936. Named from the ancient Greek word for \\"mountain\\", and -graph, the orograph was developed at the turn of the 1870s. It was designed to take precise measurements of mountains. One of its characteristics is its ease of transport: it is small enough to be carried while scrambling in the mountains. It is equipped with a sort of telescope that the operator moves along the relief, linked to a rule carrying a pen. The pen draws onto a paper disk that registers the lines on which the telescope is aimed. It thus creates an instant graph of said relief.  ≈íuvres  = Atlas = * Atlas de g√©ographie universelle (continuation de l'≈ìuvre de Vivien de Saint-Martin * 1890 : Atlas de g√©ographie moderne (directeur de la cartographie) * 1893 : Atlas de g√©ographie historique (id.) * de 1891 √† 1914 : l'Ann√©e cartographique (id.) * Franz Schrader et Louis Gallou√©dec, Atlas classique de g√©ographie ancienne et moderne, Paris : Hachette, 1905. 96 cartes et index de 13 pages. * 1923 : Atlas universel de g√©ographie = Topography = * 1874 : map of the massif Gavarnie - Mont Perdu, √† 1/40 000 (avec Lourde-Rocheblave). * 1886-1891 : map of the whole Pyr√©n√©es, topographique et g√©ologique, √† 1/80 000\\\\. * 1882-1892 : map of central Pyr√©n√©es at 1/100 000.carte des Pyr√©n√©es centrales √† 1/100 000 * 1914 : carte de Gavarnie - Mont Perdu, √† 1/20 000\\\\. = Paintings = * le Cirque de Gavarnie * la Grande Cascade de Gavarnie * le Lac Glac√© du Mont- Perdu * le Massif de la Maladetta * Panorama du mont Blanc (presented at the pavillon du Club alpin fran√ßais, during l'Exposition universelle of 1900) * le Pic du Midi d'Ossau * le Vignemale Non-comprehensive list (several hundreds of landscape paintings) = Geography lessons = In collaboration with Henri Lemonnier : * √âl√©ments de g√©ographie, r√©dig√©s suivant les programmes de l'enseignement primaire.

Early life Alvin Seale was born on July 8, 1871, in Fairmount, Indiana, to a family of Quakers. In 1892, he attended Stanford University, and was tutored by David Starr Jordan. Education In 1886, the year that Seale would have graduated from Stanford in zoology, he was picked by Professor Jordan, along with fellow student Norman B. Scofield, to go to Point Barrow in Alaska. His mission was to look for salmon in the Mackenzie River. Travels Before returning to Stanford Seale collected sea birds along the Alaskan coast on behalf of the British Museum. He also went with his roommate to the Klondike to join the gold rush there. According to Seale, his companion ‚Äústruck it rich.‚Äù Seale, however, was too busy exploring the native wildlife to waste his time searching for gold. In his unpublished diary Seale writes that he spent ‚Äúan exciting year.\\" Polynesian career and adventure In 1899 Seale returned to Stanford, only to leave again to take the job of field naturalist at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii. Within two years he was promoted to Curator of Fishes there. He held this position until 1904, when he returned to Stanford once again. While still curator Seale made the first zoological survey of Guam in 1900. He returned to Hawaii via Manila, Hong Kong, China, and Japan. From the time of his return until 1903 Seale collected specimens from all over Polynesia. He went exploring in the Society Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, and the Marquesas, Gambier, Austral, Cook, and Samoan islands. He also visited New Zealand, Australia, the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands. In May, 1905 he finally received his degree from Stanford, 13 years after beginning his studies. By this time he was already recognized as a world authority on the fishes of Polynesia, as well as an expert ichthyologist. He knew more about Polynesia and its fish and fisheries than anyone else in the United States, publishing several important papers on the subject. Books * Fishes of the South Pacific (1911) * Quest for the Golden Cloak and Other Experiences of a Field Naturalist (1946) Letter to John Muir On August 23, 1904 Seale wrote a letter to the famed naturalist John Muir, in Martinez, California.

For most of that time, its headquarters was located in the notorious Glavnjaƒça prison, on the present-day site of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Chemistry, on Students Square. From the mid-19th century until the mid-20th century, Belgrade was governed by two levels of authority - Belgrade City Administration as holder of police and administrative state authority, and Belgrade City Municipality as holder of local self-government. In 1944, Belgrade City Administration was abolished after a different administrative organization was established in Belgrade. Kingdom of Yugoslavia Belgrade City Administration in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1931 When the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was divided into banovinas in 1929, a separate administrative-territorial unit called the Belgrade City Administration was formed, encompassing the City of Belgrade with surrounding area, including Zemun and Panƒçevo. This territory was entirely surrounded by Danube Banovina, which had administrative seat in Novi Sad. Following Axis invasion, occupation and partition of Yugoslavia in 1941, the Belgrade City Administration continued to exist as an administrative-territorial unit of the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia until the end of 1941, when Serbia was divided into districts in a new territorial organization.

Dr. Bates has done especially important work in the area of medication safety. He began by describing the epidemiology of harm caused by medications, first in hospitalized patients and then in other settings such as the home and nursing homes. Subsequently, he demonstrated that by implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), medication safety could be dramatically improved in hospitals. This work led the Leapfrog Group to call CPOE one of the four changes that would most improve the safety of U.S. healthcare. It also helped hospitals to justify investing in electronic health records and in particular, CPOE. Throughout his career, Bates has published over 600 peer reviewed articles and is the most cited researcher in the fields of both patient safety and biomedical informatics, with an h-index of 115. In a 2013 analysis published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation, he ranked among the top 400 living biomedical researchers of any type. He is currently Editor of the Journal of Patient Safety. Currently, Dr. Bates serves as the Chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital and the Medical Director of Clinical and Quality Analysis for Information Systems at Partners HealthCare. In addition, he is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He served as Chief Quality Officer and Senior Vice President of Brigham and Women's from 2011 to 2014. He was appointed Chief Innovation Officer in October 2014 to 2016, and he directs the Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice there. In addition, he serves as the director of the AHRQ funded Health Information Technology Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (HIT-CERT) and the Patient Centered Learning Lab (PSLL) at the Brigham Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice.  Biography and career  David Westfall Bates was born on June 5, 1957 in Madison, Wisconsin, although he grew up in Tucson, Arizona. In high school, he worked as a computer programmer before attending college at Stanford University, where he earned his B.S. in 1979. He received an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1983, and did his residency from 1983 to 1986 at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon. From 1988 to 1990, Dr. Bates did a fellowship in general internal medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA.

Strategic control is also focused on the achievement of future goals, rather than the evaluation of past performance. Vis: > The purpose of control at the strategic level is not to answer the > question:' 'Have we made the right strategic choices at some time in the > past?\\" but rather \\"How well are we doing now and how well will we be doing > in the immediate future for which reliable information is available?\\" The > point is not to bring to light past errors but to identify needed > corrections to steer the corporation in the desired direction. And this > determination must be made with respect to currently desirable long-range > goals and not against the goals or plans that were established at some time > in the past. As with other control processes, strategic control processes are at their core cybernetic in nature: using one or more 'closed loop' controls to ensure that any observed deviations from expected activity or outcomes are highlighted to managers who can then intervene to correct / adjust the organisation's future activities. John Preble noted the need for these controls to be 'forward looking' when used to control strategy, to give controls that are \\"future- directed and anticipatory\\". > Strategic control systems cannot \\"...wait for a strategy to be executed > before getting any feedback on how well it is working. Since this might take > several years...\\" A related concern for strategic control processes is the amount of time and effort required for the process to work: if either is too great the process will either be ineffective or be ignored by the organisation. Various authors have proposed that all strategic control systems necessarily comprise a small set of standard elements, the absence of any one of which makes strategic control impossible to achieve (e.g. Goold & Quinn, Muralidharan). The four elements proposed by Muralidharan are: * the articulation of the strategic outcomes being sought * the description of the strategic activities to be carried out (attached to specific managed resources) in pursuit of the required outcomes * the definition of a method to track progress made against these two elements (usually via the monitoring of a small number of performance measures and associated target values) * the identification of an effective intervention mechanism that would allow observers (usually the organisation's managers) to change / correct / adjust the organisation's activities when targets are not achieved. These elements imply an active involvement by senior managers in the determination of the strategic activities pursued by the component parts of an organisation, and this has led some to observe that strategic control is most effective in organisations that focus on a single market or area of activity. In organisations undertaking a mix of diverse / unrelated activities (e.g. traditional conglomerates) simpler forms of financial control are more common and perhaps more effective.  History  Although control was one of the six 'functions of management'Forecasting, Planning, Organising, Commanding, Co-ordinating, Controlling listed by Henri Fayol in 1917, the idea of strategic control as a distinct activity does not appear in the management literature until the late 1970s (e.g. \\"Strategic Control: a new task for top management\\" by J H Horovitz, which was published in 1979, is a candidate for first paper to explicitly discuss the topic), but the first definition of strategic control in a form consistent with modern usage of the term is probably in a paper by Reufli and Sarrazin published in 1981. As Reufli and Sarrazin observed, the key issue with strategic control mechanisms is the need to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. A landmark study by Michael Goold and Andrew Campbell identified that a variety of control methods are used across a continuum ranging from purely financial controls at one extreme, through to detailed strategic planning systems at the other. They observed a series of trade-offs between these extremes ‚Äì financial controls being simpler and therefore cheaper and more flexible to operate, but providing less scope for co-ordination between components of an organisation, strategic planning being time-consuming and expensive to operate, but providing the greatest scope to push for maximum strategic advantage. In the middle of this range, Goold and Campbell described strategic control as allowing firms to \\"balance competitive and financial ambitions\\". This idea of a spectrum of control has since been widely adopted.  Links to other tools  Although strategic control is a general management topic rather than a proscriptive tool, its reliance on feedback on organisational performance has resulted in a long association with performance management tools such as the balanced scorecard and its derivatives such as the Performance Prism, and with related strategy implementation / execution frameworks such as the ACME framework, the five step process that proposed by Hrebiniak and Joyce., or the approach proposed by Kaplan and Norton in 2001.

Probably built about 1765 by an early settler, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, notable for its remarkably unaltered interior. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Caleb Whittaker Place is located in a remote rural setting of southwestern Weare, on the west side of Perkins Pond Road north of Peacock Hill Road. The oldest portion of the house is a simple three-bay Cape-style structure, 1-1/2 stories in height with an unfinished attic space, with what is now the central chimney offset on its west side. On the far side of the chimney a similar section was built, probably not long after the first section, but it was never finished. The finished portions of interior include deeply worn wooden flooring, horizontal wood paneling on the walls, and doors fastened with leather strap hinges. The house is believed to have been built by Caleb Whittaker, the son of one of Weare's first settlers, who may have arrived as early as 1753. The unfinished left side of the house was probably used for storage and animal shelter in the early days, and remained unfinished until 1977, when care was taken to preserve the original hand-hewn timbers. The exterior of the house was resided in 1902, at which time dormers and a porch were added. Because the house was tied up in estate litigation for many years in the 20th century, a number of features have survived inside that are often lost due to modernization.

It is located in a Classical Revival brick building on Forest Street, near the north end of Wilton's downtown area. The building was designed by the Boston, Massachusetts, firm of McLean and Wright, and built 1905-07. It was a gift of David Almus Gregg, a local manufacturer of building parts; Gregg further gave the library an endowment in 1912. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Wilton Public Library is located near the north end of Wilton's principal downtown thoroughfare, on the east side of Forest Street just beyond the junction of Main Street and Island Street. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with limestone trim. It is covered by a hip roof whose eave is studded with heavy modillion blocks. The main facade is three bays wide, with a projecting center bay topped by a fully pedimented gable and fronted by four large Corinthian columns. The outer bays house windows set in rounded-arch openings, with the openings surrounded by a keystoned arch, side pilasters, and a limestone balustrade below. The main entrance is in the center bay, flanked by smaller columns set in antis which rise to an entablature. Above this entablature is a large half-round transom with a keystoned arch. David Almus Gregg was a native of Wilton who owned a successful building parts business in Nashua, manufacturing doors, window blinds, and window sashes. Gregg was significantly involved in the design and construction of the building, providing the highest quality building materials and contractors to the project, which was estimated to cost $100,000 when completed in 1907. He then followed up the building construction with an endowment for its care, given in 1912.

ISIL and its allies captured several cities and surrounding territory, beginning with an attack on Samarra on 4 June, followed by the seizure of Mosul on 10 June, and Tikrit on 11 June. As Iraqi government forces fled south on 13 June, Kurdistan Regional Government forces took control of the oil hub of Kirkuk, part of the disputed territories of Northern Iraq. The Islamic State (IS) called the battles of Mosul and Saladin Governorate \\"the Battle of the Lion of God al-Bilawi,\\" () in honor of Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi. By late June, the Iraqi government had lost control of its borders with both Jordan and Syria. Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki called for a national state of emergency on 10 June following the attack on Mosul, which had been seized overnight. However, despite the security crisis, Iraq's parliament did not allow Maliki to declare a state of emergency; many Sunni Arab and Kurdish legislators boycotted the session because they opposed expanding the prime minister's powers. Background Since December 2013, clashes involving tribal militias, Iraqi security forces, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have been occurring throughout western Iraq. In early January 2014, ISIL militia successfully took control of Fallujah and Ramadi, bringing much of Al Anbar Governorate under their control. Afterwards, the Iraqi Army began conducting an offensive against the Anbar region, the stronghold of ISIL, with the stated goal of bringing the region under government control. Prior to conducting this counter offensive, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki gave a controversial speech in which he charactized the military campaign as a continuation of the ancient sectarian war between \\"the followers of Hussein and the followers of Yazid\\", a reference to a 7th-century defining battle for Shi'ites, thereby alienating the Sunnis of Anbar who had prior collaborated with the Iraqi government. The advances ISIL made in neighboring Syria‚Äîa source of their weapons‚Äîsubstantially strengthened their position. In early June, insurgents began to advance up over to central and northern part of Iraqi land following the Iraqi Army's capture in the Anbar industrial zone. At that point, they were still in control of most of Fallujah and Garmah, as well as parts of Haditha, Jurf Al Sakhar, Anah, Abu Ghraib and several smaller settlements in Al Anbar Governorate. On 29 June 2014, ISIL announced a change of name to Islamic State, and declared a 'Caliphate' that includes Syria and Iraq. They then declared Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as the Caliph and leader of all Muslims. Cause Some trace the beginnings of current offensive to the Syrian civil war which gave ISIL and other Sunni jihadi groups a cause and a battlefield when it looked like their campaign in Iraq was in decline while critics of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 believe the root of these events should trace back to unsuccessful nation-building as well as sectarian and ethnic division in the aftermath of Saddam Hussein's removal from power. Anne-Marie Slaughter wrote that had Obama forcibly intervened in the Syrian Civil War, it \\"could have stopped the carnage spreading today in Syria and in Iraq,\\" while Fareed Zakaria, editor of Time and former Middle Eastern policy advisor for the Bush Administration, alleged that counterproductive western intervention in Iraq and Syria served to accelerate sectarian infighting in both countries and empowered radicals on all sides. The Financial Times described the conflicts spanning Iraq and Syria as religious wars akin to Europe's Thirty Years' War. According to the Iraq's government critics, the pro-Shia policies of al-Maliki have been considered one of the main reasons of alienation Sunni Arabs and Kurds, which has played a significant role in the deterioration of security and the reemergence of Sunni extremists. Conversely, al-Maliki has accused Saudi Arabia of backing the militants of ISIL, who want to carve out a Sunni caliphate in the heart of the Middle East. This view was supported by writers in Foreign Policy magazine and The Daily Beast who asserted that the Saudi government, viewing the political ascendancy of Iraq's Shia populace as a threat, elected to provide the Sunni opposition with arms. Michael Weiss traces the origins of ISIL to Ansar al-Islam's infiltration of Iraqi Kurdistan through Iran prior to the invasion of Iraq, and further cites a variety of evidence to claim that Syrian officials intentionally abetted the rise of ISIL to damage the reputation of moderate Syrian rebels. The Iraqi army which took responsibility for holding northern Iraq, collapsed when militants including ISIL and its allies, with less than 1000 militants, attacked and seized Mosul and Tikrit easily. The Iraqi army ceded control of Kirkuk to the Kurdish Peshmerga. There are different reasons offered for this event. According to The Guardian, one scenario is that the three Iraqi generals responsible for Mosul, Tikrit, and Kirkuk didn't want to fight for a state that wasn't working. According to The Daily Telegraph, the other view is that the generals in the military headquarters of these cities had shared the same Ba'athist ideology and were the first to flee. Another scenario is that the Iraqi troops quickly realized they were no match for battle-hardened and ideologically motivated jihadis heading their way. A third theory is that the Kurds had long ago lost faith in prime minister Nouri al-Maliki's ability to serve either their interests or those of Iraq. Washington Institute for Near East Policy analyst Michael Knights noted that mutual opposition to the Shia-led government allowed for an alliance between the hitherto ideologically opposed ISIL and secular Ba'ath influenced insurgents such as the Naqshbandi order. Coordination between both groups granted ISIL the assistance of underground networks of former military, insurgents, Sunni officials and tribal groups sympathetic to the Ba'ath era government, thereby allowing a relatively small number of militants to execute a \\"coup\\" in Sunni regions where the banned Ba'ath party still retains a degree of support. The presence of Naqshbandi, MCIR and other secular Sunni insurgent groups has therefore led to tribes and some Awakening Councils opposed to ISIL supporting the insurrection. Additionally, Knights reported that in the years preceding the insurrection, the Naqshbandi led by Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri aggressively forged ties to elements of Sunni civil society opposed to the Maliki government, encouraged the establishment of protest camps at sites including Hawija and attempted to co-opt Sunni militia. The arrival of ISIS militants from Syria ultimately serving as the final catalyst behind a broader revolt. Offensive =Assault on Samarra= On 4 and 5 June 2014, ISIL militants attacked and captured parts of the city of Samarra. The ISIL operatives blew up a police station south of Samara overnight, killing several policemen, before they advanced on the city in pick-up trucks, raiding checkpoints along the way. They entered the city from the east and west and quickly captured the municipality building, university and the two largest mosques. The insurgents had reached to within from the Al-Askari Mosque, which was defended by three security belts. Militants targeted command centres near the shrine. Soon, government reinforcements were sent from Baghdad and the military managed to regain control of the city, pushing militant forces out of Samarra. 12 policemen and several civilians were killed in the fighting, while an army official claimed 80 militants also died. =Fall of Mosul and push into Kirkuk= On 6 June, ISIL attacked Mosul from the northwest and quickly entered the western part of the city. The ISIL forces numbered approximately 1,500, while there were at least 15 times more Iraqi forces. The assault started at 02:30 in the morning when ISIL convoys of pickup trucks advancing from the west shot their way through the two-man checkpoints into the city. By 03:30, street fighting was raging in Mosul. In southern Mosul, five suicide bombers attacked an arms depot killing 11 soldiers. Two suicide bombers also killed six people in the village of Muaffakiya, near Mosul. Heavy fighting continued in the city the next day. Over the two days, 61 militants, 41 government troops and seven civilians were killed. As the militants advanced they seized military vehicles and weapons and reportedly hanged soldiers and lit them ablaze, crucified them, and torched them on the hoods of Humvees. On the western edge of Tamoz 17 neighbourhood, police from the fourth battalion made a stand against the insurgents as government forces were order to form a defensive line to cordon off the besieged western Mosul neighbourhoods from the Tigris River. While fighting raged in Mosul, on 8 June, a double bomb attack, including a suicide bomber, against the Kurdish PUK party office in the town of Jalawla left 18 people dead, most of them members of the Kurdish security forces. At the same time, ISIL advanced to the east of Mosul, capturing the Hawija, Zab, Riyadh, and Abbasi areas west of the city of Kirkuk, and Rashad and Yankaja to its south after government forces retreated. By this time, insurgents surged into Mosul, sleeper cells hiding in the city had been activated and neighbourhoods rallied to them. The insurgents bombed a police station in the al-Uraybi neighbourhood and charged into the area around the Mosul Hotel, on the western bank of the Tigris, where a battle post was set up for 30 police SWAT members. The next day, ISIL forces executed 15 security forces members captured near Kirkuk. Four days later, on 13 June, in the eastern part of the province, Kurdish military forces (Peshmerga) advanced and took the city of Kirkuk, after government forces abandoned their posts in the face of the ISIL offensive, expanding the Kurdish zone of control in Northern Iraq. Kurdish forces then awaited further orders before moving towards the areas controlled by ISIL. A Peshmerga spokesman said, \\"The whole of Kirkuk has fallen into the hands of Peshmerga, no Iraqi army remains in Kirkuk now.\\" Ten tanks and dozens of Humvee vehicles that had been abandoned by the Army were seized by Kurdish forces. By the afternoon of 9 June, some 40 members of the fourth police battalion (Iraqi Federal Police?) were among the very last local police fighting to hold back the jihadists in western Mosul. The rest had either defected or deserted. At 04:30 in the afternoon, a military water tanker, rigged with explosives, raced towards the Mosul Hotel where the policemen were stationed. The subsequent explosion wounded the battalion's commander, Colonel Dhiyab Ahmed al-Assi al-Obeidi, whose leg was ripped open by the blast. Other police officers then transported him by boat across the river. This attack broke the defensive line in the west of the city. That night, generals Aboud Qanbar and Ali Ghaidan decided to withdraw across the river, leaving Lieutenant General Mahdi Gharawi, the operational commander of Nineveh Governorate, at his command post without any orders. Ghaidan and Qanbar's retreating convoy created the impression that Iraq's security forces were deserting and so Iraqi Army soldiers started to flee Mosul. The 2nd Division (Iraq) had deserted the city within a few hours and both Ghaidan and Qanbar arrived in Kurdistan the next day. On the morning of 10 June, Gharawi and 26 of his men, who were still at the operation command centre in the western part of the city, decided to fight their way across a bridge to eastern Mosul. On the east bank, their five vehicles were set ablaze and after coming under heavy fire, during which three of the soldiers were killed, it was every man for himself, as Gharawi said. In the east, Gharawi and three of his men commandeered an armoured vehicle with flat tires and headed north to safety. The militants were in control of much of the city by midday on 10 June. The militants seized numerous facilities, including Mosul International Airport, which had served as a hub for the U.S. military in the region. It was thought all aircraft located there had been captured, including helicopters and jet fighters. The militants also claimed to had released at least 2,400 prisoners, after seizing police stations and prisons across the city. However, after the takeover of Badush prison near Mosul, ISIL separated and removed the Sunni inmates, while the remaining 670 prisoners were executed. At the end of 10 June, ISIL was considered to be in control of Mosul. On 11 June, ISIL members seized the Turkish consulate in Mosul and kidnapped 48 Turkish citizens including the consul general, three children and several members of the Turkish Special Forces. Reports suggested the abductees were taken to a nearby militant base and were unharmed. An unnamed Turkish official confirmed the government was in contact with the insurgents, while Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan held an emergency meeting with members of the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) and Deputy Prime Minister Be≈üir Atalay to discuss the situation. The daring assault came a day after 28 Turkish truck drivers were abducted by militants while delivering fuel to a power plant in Mosul. Earlier that day, the governor of Ninawa Governate, Atheel al-Nujaifi, accused the military commanders that were in Mosul of abandoning the battlefield and fleeing from the city. The governor demanded that they be tried in a military court. He also stated that it was not just ISIL that captured Mosul but that other small militias had provided support in capturing the city. On 20 September 2014 the hostages captured on 11 June 2014 from the Turkish consulate in Mosul were released. ISIL seized large quantities of US- supplied military equipment. It also freed thousands of prisoners, many of whom are likely to join the insurgency. There were conflicting reports about the east bank of Mosul, which has a significant population of Assyrians, Kurds, Turkmens, Shabaks and Armenians, with some suggesting it was controlled by Kurdish Peshmergas while according to others it was ISIL-controlled. Sources within the Iraq government allege that in the months preceding the assault, Ba'ath loyalists led by al-Douri had been in contact with disaffected Sunni officers who either defected or withdrew upon the ISIL-Ba'ath attack. While speaking to the charity Aid to the Church in Need, Chaldean Catholic Church Archbishop Amel Nona stated \\"Mosul's last remaining Christians had left now a city which until 2003 was home to 35,000 faithful.\\" =Conquest of Baiji and Tikrit= On 11 June, insurgents advanced into the oil refinery town of Baiji, seizing the main court house and police station and setting them on fire. The militants, who were travelling in a group of around 60 vehicles, also took control of the Baiji prison and freed all the inmates. Local residents told members of the media that ISIL sent a group of local tribal chiefs ahead of them to convince the 250 guards at the oil plant to withdraw, while soldiers and police had been warned to leave as well. Later in the day, militants reportedly retreated from Baiji, either due to persuasion from local tribal leaders or due to reinforcements from the Iraqi Army's Fourth Armored Division arriving in the city. However, the next day it was confirmed ISIL was still in control of the town, except the refinery which was surrounded. Continuing their offensive, on the evening of 11 June, insurgents took full control of the city of Tikrit, the hometown of former president Saddam Hussein and the second provincial capital to fall in two days. Local officials reported that checkpoints had been set up around the city, while at least 300 inmates had been freed from the city's prisons, many of them serving sentences under terrorism charges. Two police stations were burned down and a military base was captured. ISIL forces had also reached Samarra and were fighting government troops at the city's northwest entrance. At this point, Iraqi government officials described the situation as a \\"strategic disaster\\" for the Iraqi government and army. =Advance towards Baghdad and into Diyala= On 12 June, ISIL continued their advance towards Baghdad, the capital and largest city of Iraq, moving into towns just an hour's drive from the city. It controlled parts of the small town of Udhaim, 90 km (60 miles) north of Baghdad, after most of the army troops left their positions and withdrew towards the nearby town of Khalis in Diyala Governorate. ISIL also captured ten towns in Saladin Governorate, but not Tuz Khormato, Dujail, Balad, Samarra or Amirli. Samarra had reportedly become surrounded by ISIL forces. Meanwhile, an Iraqi Border Patrol battalion stationed along the Syrian border in the western Anbar Governorate abandoned its positions in the face of advancing ISIL forces to break out to the relative safety of the Kurdish-controlled town of Sinjar in Nineveh. However, the convoy of 60 trucks and hundreds of border police were thrown into disarray and panic when a small force of ISIL vehicles attacked them en route. By the time Kurdish forces arrived, the police force had been completely routed, with an unknown number of killed and captured, while others fled into the desert, leaving all their vehicles behind. Only two policemen managed to arrive at Sinjar on foot. In the early hours of 13 June, ISIL seized two towns in Diyala Governorate, after security forces abandoned their posts in Al-Sadiyah and Jalawla. Several villages around the Hamrin Mountains were also captured.Insurgents take two more Iraqi towns, Obama threatens air strikes At the same time, Kurdish forces entered Jalula to secure offices of Kurdish parties in the town. =Government counter-attack= An Iraqi Air Force AC-208 firing a Hellfire missile during a training exercise in 2010. On 13 June 2014, Iraqi forces supported by elements of the Quds Force and Iranian Revolutionary Guards had gathered in the town of Samarra and claimed to have regained control of parts of Saladin Governorate, namely the town of Dhuluiyah. Journalists from Al-Monitor embedded in Mosul and Tikrit reported that repeated airstrikes by the government made ISIL militants depart from conspicuous positions within the cities. In their place, militants associated with the Naqshbandi Army and other anti-government groups led by former Ba'ath officers assumed the visible role of patrolling and administration. Militants were reported to have appointed former Ba'ath generals Azhar al-Obeidi and Ahmed Abdul Rashid as the governors of Mosul and Tikrit. Sunni militants remained in control of Tikrit and its strategically significant COB Speicher military base and air field. Insurgents in Tikrit were reported to be mining the roads leading into the city and positioning artillery to resist an anticipated siege. According to The Guardian newspaper, the call to arms by the highest Shia authority in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, on 13 June mobilized in less than one day around a division of militiamen who, unlike the military, would not run from a fight with the insurgents. On 14 June, Al-Maliki went to Samarra and declared \\"Samarra will be the starting point, the gathering station of our troops to cleanse every inch that was desecrated by footsteps of those traitors.\\" There were conflicting reports about the situation of al-Dhuluiya, outside of Samarra. Government officials and state TV claimed that Iraqi security forces had taken control of the town, but security officials in Samarra and witnesses there told CNN the town was still under ISIL control. The same day, the Iraqi military attacked ISIL forces in al-Mutasim, south-east of Samarra, driving militants out into the surrounding desert. Meanwhile, the bodies of 128 Iraqi soldiers and policemen killed in clashes with ISIL were received by medical staff in Mosul. Also, it was reported that the Iraqi Army had killed seven Kurdish security forces in an airstrike in Diyala. Jabbar Yawar, the secretary general of the Peshmerga, said talks with Iraqi authorities were under way to ascertain what had happened. The next day, the military recaptured Ishaqi where the burned bodies of 12 policemen were found. On 28 June, Iraqi forces launched an attack against the city of Tikrit. =Renewed ISIL advance= Peshmerga T-55 tank outside Kirkuk on 19 June 2014. Late on 15 June, after repeated assaults, an insurgent assault, primarily led by the Naqshbandi Army and former Ba'athists, captured Tal Afar and its nearby airbase The defenders, composed largely of Shia Turkmen and soldiers retreating from Mosul, escaped to Kurdish-controlled territory. During the fighting for Tal Afar, 18 militants died, and ten people were killed in the insurgent shelling of the town. The local security garrison suffered heavy casualties, but the number was unknown. It was also claimed that Major General Abu Al-Waleed was captured at Tal Afar, but he allegedly later denied this on state TV. During that day, rebels made claims of executing 1,000‚Äì1,800 captured soldiers, while the military claimed the Air Force had killed 279 militants in the previous 24 hours. Analysis of execution videos by military experts managed to confirm the killing of at least 170 soldiers. On 15 June, ISIL also advanced further into Diyala Governorate gaining control of two villages in Adhaim, northeast of Baghdad. The next day, 28‚Äì29 Iraqi Shiite volunteer militiamen were killed in an ambush of their convoy south of Samarra by ISIL. Meanwhile, the military claimed to have killed 56 insurgents in areas of western and southern Baghdad, while fighting in Diyala Governorate left 29 militants and eight soldiers dead. A number of soldiers were also captured. The first Iranian soldier was also killed. West of Baghdad, ISIL captured Saqlawiyah where army helicopters were hovering over the town to provide cover for retreating troops. During the fighting a helicopter was shot down. In the evening, police executed 44 Sunni prisoners at a police station in Baqubah before retreating due to an advance by ISIL forces which captured several neighborhoods in the city. Conflicting information has been presented regarding the number killed and the identity of those responsible, as the Washington Post reported that the prisoners were either killed during a battle with ISIL or \\"preemptively\\" by security forces. The situation regarding the killing of a Sunni imam in Baghdad is also unclear. On 17 June, according to BBC the Army had retaken the captured districts of Baqubah. Elsewhere, security forces withdrew from the Al-Qa'im border crossing as rebels from the Free Syrian Army and al-Nusra Front crossed the border and took hold of it. Also, east of Samarra, the bodies of 18 executed security force members were discovered. On 18 June, ISIL attacked Iraq's largest oil refinery in Baiji with mortars and machine guns. An official from inside the refinery stated the militants had captured 75 percent of the facility, while a military spokesman claimed the attack had been repelled with 40 insurgents being killed. Meanwhile, rebels overran three villages in Salaheddin Governorate following fighting that left some 20 civilians dead. Also, India said that 40 of its nationals, who were working for a Turkish construction company in Mosul, had been abducted by militants. At the same time, Raouf Abdel Rahman, the presiding judge during the trial of Saddam Hussein, was reportedly captured and executed by insurgents, though that was later denied by family members and the Kurdistan Regional Government. On 19 June, government forces claimed to have regained full control of the Baiji oil refinery, after heavy fighting with ISIL fighters that left 100 militants dead. An Iraqi witness who drove past the Baiji refinery told the Associated Press that ISIL had hung their banners from the watch towers and created checkpoints surrounding the facility, despite government claims of control. By the evening, the two sides held different parts of the refinery. The same day, ISIL captured the Al Muthanna Chemical Weapons Facility near Lake Tharthar, 45 miles northwest of Baghdad, in an area which was firmly come under rebel control by this point. On 20 June, the oil refinery was still surrounded by ISIL forces and had once again come under attack. By the evening, US officials had told ABC News that the 270 Iraqi troops trapped in the refinery were outnumbered and outgunned. And, with ISIL in control of the roads to and from Baiji, there was little chance of their resources being replenished. The militants planned to wait until the troops ran out of food and ammunition. On the same day, ISIL claimed to have captured most of the Tal Afar airport. Kurdish forces, who were accompanied by a BBC news crew, became surrounded by ISIL on three sides in Jalula and later it was confirmed the control of the town was divided between the Kurds and ISIL. On 21 June, militants captured the Baiji oil refinery after overnight clashes with government forces. On the same day, Iraqi Shia militias rallied all over Iraq to show their strength. The largest rally was in Baghdad in which thousands of members of Shia militia Promised Day Brigades participated. Also, ISIL clashed with allied Sunni militants, leaving 17 dead in Hawija. On 23 June, insurgents captured the Tal Afar airport and secured the town itself. Iraqi security sources confirmed for the first time the Baiji oil refinery had been seized by militants, after being attacked for several days. 400 soldiers of the 37th Brigade, including its officers, deserted from the refinery following an agreement reached with tribal leaders per which the troops had free passage to leave for 24 hours. 50‚Äì75 police commandos, who refused to desert, attempted to prevent the Brigade's desertion at gunpoint but were outnumbered by the soldiers and backed down. This left the insurgents in control of virtually the entire facility, except one compound where the refinery's operating systems are located due to the SWAT members barricading themselves in the building. A standoff ensued as the insurgents didn't want to risk a direct assault for fear of damaging the facilities systems. Instead, ISIL decided to slowly starve out the commandos if they refused to surrender, since no reinforcements could be flown in to the SWAT unit due to the heavy insurgent anti-aircraft fire around the refinery. The siege of the building continued as of mid-July. By this point, sources reported that a combination of desertions, casualties and loss of equipment crippled the regular Iraqi military, forcing the government to increasingly rely on volunteers drawn from Shia militias. Iraqi officials also conceded they had essentially given up on the north of the country to the insurgent forces. On 24 June, the Syrian Arab Republic launched its first airstrikes in Iraqi territory after previously targeting Syrian- Iraqi border crossings controlled by ISIL. Syria launched new strikes the next day when at least 50 people were killed and 132 others wounded, including civilians, after missiles launched by Syrian fighters hit a municipal building, a market, and a bank in Al Rutba. It was unclear whether the Syrian fighters actually entered Iraqi territory when they made the airstrikes. On 25 June, anonymous American officials reported that Iran set up a special control center at Al-Rasheed Air Base in Baghdad and was flying a \\"small fleet\\" of Ababil drones over Iraq, and an Iranian signals intelligence unit had also been deployed at the airfield to intercept electronic communications between ISIL fighters and commanders. 10 divisions of Iranian and Quds Force troops were massed on the Iran‚ÄìIraq border and about two dozen Iranian aircraft had been stationed in western Iran. Meanwhile, insurgents overran the Ajeel oil site, east of Tikrit, after the nearby town of al-Alam was seized by the militants and insurgents surrounded on three sides the massive Balad air base, also known as Joint Base Balad and \\"Camp Anaconda\\" under U.S. occupation, and struck it with mortars. Aftermath =Army Tikrit counter-offensive= On 26 June, government forces launched an airborne assault on Tikrit and an all- out ground offensive two days later in an attempt to recapture the city. However, by 30 June the assault had stalled and government troops pulled back from Tikrit to the south, after meeting stiff resistance, in an attempt to regroup. Also during this time, on the morning of 26 June, militants captured the town of Mansouriyat al-Jabal, which is the home to four natural gas fields, although government forces managed to recapture the town the next day. They also reportedly recaptured al-Alam. On 4 July, the ISIL published a video claiming its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivered a sermon for half an hour during Friday prayers at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri Mosul, Iraq. \\"Iraqi agencies are still investigating the video and comparing it with its intelligence,\\" Iraq's military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Qassim Atta, said on 7 July. On the other hand, the United States \\"has no reason to doubt\\" the authenticity of a video that purports to show ISIL leader.'No reason to doubt' it's al-Baghdadi On 15 July, the military launched a new assault on Tikrit from Awja. However, by the next day, government troops had been repelled and once again retreated. Several security force's vehicles were seen abandoned, with at least one of them burnt out. On 17 July, insurgents launched an assault on Camp Speicher, near Tikrit, in an attempt to capture the air base. However, by 21 July, the attack had reportedly been repelled. =August ISIL offensive= In early August 2014, ISIL launched a new offensive against Kurdish-held territory in northern Iraq and within days captured the town of Sinjar, displacing its Yazidi population. ISIL had also advanced to within 40 kilometers from the Kurdish capital of Erbil. This prompted the United States to start launching air-strikes on advancing ISIL forces. Consequences =Proclamation of a Caliphate= On 29 June 2014, ISIL or ISIS announced its name change to the Islamic State and announced the formation of a 'Caliphate', which would include Iraq and Syria, and in theory covers the global Muslim population. They called upon Muslims all over the world to pledge allegiance to their Caliph, Ibrahim Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ISIL claimed to have a plan to take over the city of Arar in Saudi Arabia, which is very close to the Iraqi border. In July NBC news reported that disagreements had erupted between ISIL and two large Sunni insurgent groups in Iraq, the Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order and 1920 Revolution Brigade, leading to skirmishes between the allies on July. NBC quoted an unnamed senior U.S. counterterrorism official claiming that \\"the tribal groups do not necessarily follow strict Islamic law the way ISIS does, which naturally leads to conflict\\". =Kurdish referendum for independence= thumb250px Masoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdistan Region expressed on 3 July his will to organize a referendum to push forward the area's independence from Iraq. The Kurdish forces indeed control an important area in northern Iraq, outside of ISIL's control, and now away from the Iraqi government's influence. Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu declared in June 2014 that his government would support an independent Kurdistan. =Massacre of minorities= Reports tell that thousands of Assyrians, Yazidis, Kurds and other ethnic minorities were massacred by ISIL fighters. After the capture of Qaraqosh, the Iraqi city with largest Assyrian population, on 7 August, thousands fled their homes from the city and Mosul as they were given an ultimatum by the insurgents. The Assyrians, Yazidis, Kurds and other minorities were massacred. They were buried alive, burnt alive, shot down, the women of these groups were raped and killed or married to ISIL fighters. Many Kurds were frightened that ISIL would make another Anfal Genocide. \\"Qaraqosh, Tal Kayf, Bartella and Karamlesh have been emptied of their original population and are now under the control of militants\\", Joseph Thomas, the Arch Bishop of the Iraqi cities of Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah, told AFP. Qaraqosh has an estimated Christian population of about 50,000. Chaldean Patriarch Louis Sako said the ISIL advance into Iraq created a 'humanitarian disaster' and that more than 100,000 Christians were forced to leave their homes. \\"The churches are occupied and crosses taken down\\", and more than 1,500 documents had been destroyed, he said. Around Sinjar, the withdrawal of Peshmerga from the area without notifying the Yazidis after reassurances of protection, prompted the locals to flee to Kurdistan Region after brief clashes between the locals and ISIS. The Peshmerga has also been accused of confiscating weapons from the Yazidis in Sinjar. In the Nineveh Plains, Peshmerga also abandoned their posts without notifying the local population. Local Assyrians had accused the Peshmerga of confiscating their weapons. This allowed for a larger-scale massacre of the defenseless Assyrian and Yazidi populations. Reactions =Domestic= Despite the security crisis, Iraq's Parliament was not convened and did not allow Maliki to declare a state of emergency; many Sunni and Kurdish legislators boycotted the session because they opposed expanding the prime minister's powers. Most Iraqis view the conflict as a partial Sunni uprising, rather than as a simple lunge for power by ISIL.Iraq: How did it come to this?, economist.com. Shia On 13 June 2014, the highest religious authority for the Shia in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, asked people to fight the Islamic State. According to one of his representatives, Sheikh Abdulmehdi al-Karbalai, he asked for \\"people who are capable of carrying arms and fighting the terrorists in defense of their country...

In late June, powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr vowed to \\"shake the ground\\" under the feet of the militants, days after fighters loyal to him paraded with weapons in the Sadr City area of north Baghdad, vowing to fight the militant offensive. Sunni Fugitive Iraq Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni who described the fall of Mosul as a \\"Revolution of the oppressed, downtrodden and marginalized people in Mosul\\", denied ISIL played a leading role amongst the government's opponents and alleged the militancy against the central government was led by Sunni tribes and disenfranchised Sunnis. Another prominent Sunni, Ali Hatem al-Suleiman (emir of the large Dulaim tribe), claimed \\"It is the tribal rebels who are in control of the situation in Mosul. It is not reasonable to say that a group like ISIL, which has a small number of men and vehicles, could be in control of a large city like Mosul. Therefore, it is clear that this is a tribal revolution, but the government is trying to force us all to wear the robe of the terrorists and ISIS.\\" A member of insurgent held Mosul's governing council, a former colonel in the Ba'ath era military alleged that the opposition to the government was composed of multiple Sunni Arab factions, most of which are led by officers from the disbanded military. The former officer claimed that the various opposition factions were working to minimize ISIL influence and appoint officials capable of restoring services in insurgent held areas. Kurdish Kurdish parliamentarian Shoresh Haji stated \\"I hope that the Kurdish leadership will not miss this golden opportunity to bring Kurdish lands in the disputed territories back under Kurdish control\\". =International reactions= ;International bodies * ‚Äì On 12 June, Arab League Secretary-General, Nabil al-Arabi condemned what he described as the \\"criminal activities\\" committed by ISIL group in Mosul. He emphasized on the necessity of \\"national consensus in Iraq at this critical time, which threatens Iraq's security and political stability.\\" * ‚Äì On 10 June, the United Nation's Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, asked all political leaders in Iraq to show national unity against the ISIL invasion, expressed grave concern about the \\"serious deterioration\\", and condemned the recent attacks that have left scores dead and wounded in Iraq's northern and eastern provinces. He recalled that all UN Member States have an obligation to implement and enforce the targeted financial sanctions, arms embargo and travel ban imposed on ISIS under the sanctions regime pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1267 (1999) and Security Council Resolution 1989 (2011). It also evacuated its 60 staff members from Baghdad to neighboring Jordan. After ISIL released graphic photographs of its fighters shooting scores of young men, the United Nations said on 16 June, cold blooded \\"executions\\" said to have been carried out by militants in northern Iraq almost certainly amount to war crimes. ; U.N. member states * ‚Äì On 16 June, Indian External Affairs Ministry condemned the takeover of Iraqi cities like Mosul and Tikrit by ISIL and reiterated its support to the government and the people of Iraq in their fight against international terrorism. It also set up a 24-hour helpline at Indian embassy in Baghdad for assistance of Indian nationals stranded in these cities. It has been reported that 46 Indian nurses were abducted from the Iraqi town of Mosul who were later freed and flown back to India. * ‚Äì On 12 June, the Iranian president, Hasan Rouhani, stated: \\"For our part, as the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran ... we will combat violence, extremism and terrorism in the region and the world.\\" On 11 June, the Foreign Minister of Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif, had condemned the \\"murder of Iraqi citizens\\" as he offered Iraq's government support against terrorism. However, Iranian officials have not explained how Iran will help Iraq's government. Iran dispatched Revolutionary Guard forces to help Iraq's government recapture Tikrit. Iran sent three battalions of the special operations Quds Force and has sent a total of 2000 men between 12‚Äì14 June. According to Washington Post, any support from Iran will be subtler, confined to military planning and strategy rather than manpower. * - Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed \\"full support\\" to the Iraqi government. Eight days later, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov announced that \\"Russia will not stand idle toward attempts by terrorist groups to spread terrorism in regional states\\" and urged Europe and the United States to take action against ISIL. On 29 June, Russia delivered Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft to the Iraqi Air Force, days after a request by the Iraqi government. Unconfirmed reports suggest that six Sukhoi Su-30 multirole aircraft are to be delivered as well. Photos have appears on Iraqi social media depicting Russian-made rocket artillery TOS-1 arriving in Baghdad. * ‚Äì On 11 June, Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates condemned recent acts of militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant on the territory of Iraq. It also expressed support and solidarity to the Iraqi government in its fight against the armed terrorist groups in Iraq. On 15 June, the Syrian Air Force was carrying out airstrikes on ISIL bases in coordination with Iraq. Airstrikes were carried out against ISIL bases in Raqqa and Al-Hasakah inside Syria, and headquarters in Shaddadi, a town close to the border with Iraq. * ‚Äì The Saudi Arabia government said that the tensions there were due to sectarian policies which threatened its stability and sovereignty, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. It warned against foreign intervention and urged Iraqis to form a national unity government. * ‚Äì ISIL captured Ankara's consul general in Mosul and detained 49 Turkish citizens including the Consul-General, √ñzt√ºrk Yƒ±lmaz. It also took hostage 31 Turkish truck drivers. Some reports suggest that the hostages have been moved to the residence of the ISIL-sponsored Mosul governor, in possible preparation for their release. Turkey has called an emergency NATO meeting. :The hostages were freed in mid September 2014. Turkey denied paying ransom but prisoner swaps were hinted at. It was later revealed that Turkish authorities had initially paid a certain amount of money to ISIL officials and the hostages were later swapped for 180 militants who had been apprehended or undergoing medical treatment in Turkey. * ‚Äì On 17 June, Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would be reopening the British Embassy in Iran in an effort to rebuild the nations' diplomatic relationship to help combat the recent event in Iraq. On 18 June, PM Cameron said that he believed ISIL was planning a terror attack on the UK. * ‚Äì On 12 June, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was exploring all options to save Iraq's security forces from collapse, and U.S. companies evacuated hundreds from a major air base. \\"Our national security team is looking at all the options... I don't rule out anything,\\" he declared. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham warned an ISIL takeover in both Iraq and Syria would create a \\"hell on earth\\" and called for the urgent deployment of U.S. air power to \\"change the battlefield equation.\\" :On 13 June, Obama said the United States \\"will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq,\\" but that he would be reviewing a range of other options in coming days. He called on Iraq's neighbors to help out, too, and told the only guarantee of success involved political reforms by al-Maliki that promoted cooperation with Sunnis. :On 15 June, US government announced that it was drawing down staff at its embassy in Baghdad. Referring to the \\"ongoing instability and violence in certain areas,\\" a State Department statement said the embassy will also increase the number of security personnel deployed at the heavily guarded mission. A separate Pentagon statement said \\"a small number\\" of Defense Department personnel were being sent to augment security at the facility. :On 16 June, President Obama notified Congress that a total of 275 U.S. soldiers and Marines could be deployed to Iraq to provide security for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other U.S. personnel in Iraq. About 160 troops were already in the country and 100 will be stationed as reserve forces in a nearby country to be deployed if needed. The special forces team would operate under the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and would be barred from engaging in ground combat. :The Guardian reported on 18 June that Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and John McCain thought Maliki's government should step down. White House spokesman Jay Carney said, \\"we will aggressively attempt to impress upon that leader the absolute necessity of rejecting sectarian governance\\". The Secretary of State, John Kerry, stated that Washington was not focused Maliki, but on the Iraqi people. A spokesman for the Nouri al-Malik said he will not stand down. :As of 19 June, reports emerged suggesting that if the United States carries out airstrikes over Iraq, as requested by the Iraqi government, that Obama may act without Congressional approval. Also on 19 June, Barack Obama announced he is sending up to 300 military advisers to Iraq, and could down the road authorize targeted military action, if necessary. According to CNN, one aircraft carrier and five warships are already positioned in the Persian Gulf, U.S. drones are flying intelligence missions over Iraq and a list of ISIL targets has been compiled. :On 23 June, John Kerry met with Nouri al-Malik, Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zibari, and Sunni and Shia leaders in Baghdad. The purpose was to affirm the US commitment to Iraq during the crisis and to discuss the formation of a new government. These meetings occur as ISIL proceeded to capture more territory north and west of the capital. Kerry also rejected al- Maliki's request for prompt American airstrikes on the militants' positions in Iraq and Syria, saying that care must be taken before such attacks are launched to avoid giving the impression that the Americans are targeting Sunnis. :On 8 August 2014, President Obama authorized airstrikes and humanitarian aid to civilians trapped in the mountains, who didn't have access to food or water. He said the move for airstrikes was to stop the advancement of the IS convoys into Erbil. He strongly asserted that the minorities, including the Christians and the Yazidis must be protected from the 'genocide'. =Others= On 14 June, Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, described the event as a \\"national revolution\\"ÿ•ŸÜ ŸÖÿß Ÿäÿ≠ÿØÿ´ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÜŸáŸäÿßÿ± ÿ¥ÿßŸÖŸÑ ŸçŸÑŸÇŸàŸâ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ≥ŸÉÿ± ŸàÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ÿ∑ÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ ŸÑŸÖ Ÿäÿ£ÿ™ ŸÖŸÜ ŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ∫ÿå ŸàŸÑÿß ŸäŸÖŸÉŸÜ ÿ£ŸÜ ŸäŸÅÿ≥ÿ± ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ£ŸÜŸá ÿ¨ÿßÿ° ÿ®ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ® ÿ´Ÿàÿ±ÿ© Ÿçÿ¥ÿπÿ®Ÿäÿ©ÿå ŸÉŸÖÿß ÿØÿπÿß ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇŸäŸäŸÜ ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπÿßŸã ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿπ ÿ®ÿ™ÿ£ŸÑŸäŸÅ ÿßÿ™ÿ≠ÿßÿØ ÿπŸÑŸÖÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖŸäŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¶ÿßÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿ∂ÿßŸàŸä: ŸÖÿß Ÿäÿ≠ÿØÿ´ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ ÿ´Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ÿ¥ÿπÿ®Ÿäÿ© He said the insurgency \\"could not have been led by one Islamist party,\\" a reference to ISIL, instead describing it as a \\"all-out Sunni revolution\\" (or \\"Overwhelming revolution for Sunnah\\" ) and warned against sectarian war. Calling for the formation of a \\"national unity government\\", he said that \\"this is not a revolution against the Shias\\". According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, \\"The Kurds, seeing the Iraqi central regime's weakness, will take all the necessary measures to protect their autonomy and expand their influence to neighboring Syrian Kurdistan. The Kurds understand very well that they could be the next target after the Assyrians and accordingly will preempt any attempt by the jihadists to set foot in their areas. The fall of Mosul could become the beginning of Kurdish quest for independence.\\" Tirana Hassan, of the Human Rights Watch, reports that Khorasani Brigade, a Shia militia, has ethnically cleansed the village of Yengija, 50 miles south of Kirkuk. The Sunni population was driven from the village and their homes were razed.

Built in 1886, the red brick building is a prominent local example of civic Queen Anne style architecture. In a common style of the day, it includes a theater space which was used for dramatic presentations, silent films, and vaudeville productions, before being converted to its present use as a movie theater. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history Wilton Town Hall occupies a prominent setting in the center of the town, on the east side of Main Street. It occupies a steeply sloping triangular lot bounded on the north by Maple Street. Its basement side is completely exposed on the Main Street side, and is composed of rustically cut Milford granite. The rest of the building is built out of load-bearing red brick, and is covered by a slate roof with a complex roofline. Windows in the upper levels are generally set in rounded- arch openings, and the roof is punctuated by several brick chimneys and a square clock tower. The clock is original to the building, made by George Milton Stevens of Boston, Massachusetts. The interior of the building is divided into civic offices and a theater. Its finishes are largely original, including fine woodwork on the main staircases, floors, and wainscoting. The town hall was completed in 1886, and has housed town offices since then. It was the first building in the town dedicated to housing all of the town functions, including town clerk, police, and selectmen's offices. It was built in the aftermath of fires in 1874 and 1881 that destroyed much of what is now downtown Wilton. Its construction further cemented the importance of Wilton's East Village as the town's main village center. The hall was designed by Merrill and Cutler of Lowell, Massachusetts, and its design was featured in an architectural publication in 1884.

The bill would appropriate $20.9 billion. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill. Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \\"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. The bill covers appropriations for the Department of Agriculture, as well as for a variety of related agencies. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall. In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation.

Procedural history The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 4, 2014 by Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL). The bill was reported by the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The accompanying committee report was Report 113-468. The bill was considered by the House on June 11, 2014 under an open rule which meant that House members were allowed to offer as many amendments to the bill as they wanted. Debate and discussion One provision of the bill would waive the requirement that schools follow certain nutritional requirements in their school lunches, requirements that first lady Michelle Obama has been a strong supporter of. Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) announced his intention to add an amendment to the bill that would stop the FDA from interfering with artisan cheese-makers who use wooden boards and shelves to age their cheese. According to Welch, the FDA's crackdown is \\"without evidence\\" and an example of \\"overreach.\\" An amendment offered by Rep Barbara Lee (D-CA) was accepted by voice vote. The amendment moves $8.1 million of funding from the Secretary of Agriculture's administrative budget to provide additional funding (now a total of $35 million) for a grant program to schools allowing them to buy equipment for making and serving breakfast to students. Lee argued that \\"the bottom line is breakfasts are very, very important to the growth, health and welfare and the development of our children.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *2015 United States federal appropriations References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4800 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4800 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4800 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4800 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4800 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4800 *Report 113-468 on H.R. 4800 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States federal appropriations in the 113th Congress ","title":"Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015"},{"id":"43017488","text":"John Tarleton (26 October 1755 ‚Äì 19 September 1841) was an English ship-owner, slave-trader and politician. He was a son of John Tarleton, a West Indies merchant and slave trader, from Aigburth near Liverpool, and brother of Banastre Tarleton. The younger John also became a West India merchant, in partnership with his brothers Thomas and Clayton, and Daniel Backhouse. Between 1786 and 1804 he invested in 39 Liverpool-registered ships. At the 1790 general election he unsuccessfully contested the borough of Seaford, but an election petition resulted in him being awarded the seat in 1792. In Parliament, he opposed measures to abolish or regulate the slave trade. At the 1796 general election, he did not contest Seaford but stood against his brother Banastre in Liverpool, but failed to win a seat. Tarleton married Isabella Collingwood (c.1770‚Äìc.1850), who was heir of Alexander Collingwood of Unthank and Little Ryle, near Alnham. Their four children were all born between 1792 and 1806 in Liverpool. Tarleton went on to inherit the Collingwood estates in Northumberland, and also owned property in Gloucester Place, London.

History The station was the terminus of the Corringham Light Railway. As opened, it had a cycle shed, male and female lavatories and an open-fronted shelter. There was also a small loading bank beyond the passenger platform. The buildings and platform were in red brick. Initially, the platform's length was 150 ft. During the First World War, the platform was lengthened to 340 ft, owing to the increased number of workers travelling to the explosive factories at Kynochtown. The platform remained this length until closure. In later years, the station became very dilapidated and run-down, and suffered a sharp fall in passenger numbers after the introduction of buses to the area in the 1920s. The loading bank was cut back and was out of use by the mid-1930s. The station closed in 1952 when the Vacuum Oil Company bought up the Coryton refinery and discontinued the passenger services. After closure The station was demolished almost immediately after closure and the whole branch was lifted at about the same time. Despite this, the remainder of the railway remains in use as a goods line. The section between Thames Haven and Coryton was relaid at about the same time the Corringham branch was removed.

It houses the offices of the Government of San Diego County. It was completed in 1938 and was primarily funded by the Works Progress Administration. It was previously known as the San Diego Civic Center and as the City and County Administration Building. Because of its notable architecture and its location fronting San Diego Bay, it is nicknamed the Jewel on the Bay. Architects were Samuel Wood Hamill, William Templeton Johnson, Richard Requa and Louis John Gill. The building used innovative construction techniques to guard against earthquakes, and the project was considered to be \\"a prototype of American civic center architecture\\".Bridging the Centuries, San Diego County Government websiteThe Journal of San Diego History, SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY, Winter 2002, Volume 48, Number 1, \\"CIVIL ENGINEERING FOR BUILDINGS\\", Thomas G. Atkinson The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 16, 1988. History In order to consolidate city and county government offices which were scattered across downtown San Diego, city planner John Nolen was engaged to plan a civic center. Voters rejected the first draft plan (1908) which would have placed the civic center downtown. In 1926 Nolen completed a plan which placed the civic center on newly dredged tidelands. This plan was approved in a March 1927 election. There was considerable opposition to building on the tidelands, in part because it was felt such a building would be unstable in an earthquake, but it was stabilized by 30-foot-long steel pilings driven in the ground and other measures. Some of the steel pilings were alternated in a manner designed to bear lateral stress; this was a novel design and was considered to be \\"on the cutting edge of engineering developments.\\" Engineering issues and the Great Depression delayed the start of construction until 1935, when $1 million of Works Progress Administration funds were assigned to the project (combined with $750,000 of local funds). President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the building on July 16, 1938 before a crowd estimated as 25,000 people. In 1964 the city moved its offices to a new downtown Community Concourse, and since then the building has held county offices only. Today many county offices are housed in a County Operations Center at 5500-5600 Overland Avenue, and the county maintains several branch offices to serve the public. The historic County Administration Center is still the home of the Board of Supervisors, the Chief Administrative Officer, the Assessor, the County Clerk, the Treasurer/Tax Collector, and many forms of public records. In 2014 a waterfront park was opened on the former site of the building's parking lots. Architecture The design was intended to complement structures in Balboa Park, a mix of Spanish Revival and Beaux-Arts architecture. Southwestern touches include \\"a red Mission tile roof, glazed Franciscan inlaid pottery tile, and arched door and window openings.\\" The design of the central office tower included so-called P.W.A. Moderne. The structure also features the detail of Zigzag moderne through the use of a large amount of ornamentation, \\"recessed windows in vertical patterns,\\" and \\"smooth-surfaced columns.\\" The county's art collection shown inside the building includes works by Charles Reiffel, Charles Fries, and a portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt by Donald Armand Luscomb. Artwork A sculpture fountain, Guardian of Water (1939), by Donal Hord, stands on the harbor side of the building. Murals inside the building are by Arthur Ames and Jean Goodwin; they are painted with egg tempera, a popular water medium used in Italy in the 13th-15th centuries. Waterfront Park In May 2014, the County Administration Center Waterfront Park opened on both the north and south sides of the building, formerly surface parking lots. The Waterfront Park, more than a decade in the making, contains open grassy areas, gardens planted with drought-tolerant flowers on the north side, and picnic areas, a playground with colorful swings and slides, and an interactive water fountain on the south side.\\"New Waterfront Park Opens to Public\\", NBC7 San Diego, May 12, 2014\\"CAC Waterfront Park\\", San Diego County website Gallery San Diego County Administration Center 2.jpgDetail of west entrance San Diego County Administration Center 1.jpgCloseup of headstone on mosaic, west entrance San Diego City and County Administration Building.jpgCounty Building, west facade San Diego Civic Center 2.jpgCounty Building, seen from across Harbor Drive Waterfront Park, San Diego County Administration Center 1.jpgFountains, Waterfront Park Waterfront Park, San Diego County Administration Center 2.jpgPlayground, Waterfront Park San Diego Port Authority building (49464379223).jpgBuilding lit in Los Angeles Lakers shortly after the death of Kobe Bryant References Country Administration Center Category:Government buildings completed in 1938 Category:Parks in San Diego Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Diego Category:1930s architecture in the United States Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in California Category:Mission Revival architecture in California Category:Moderne architecture in California Category:PWA Moderne architecture in California Category:Spanish Revival architecture in California Category:Streamline Moderne architecture in California Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in California ","title":"San Diego County Administration Center"},{"id":"43017513","text":"Covasna's inclined plane (also called »òiclƒÉu) is a unique standard gauge railway system used to carry logs by using gravity, without any other source of energy. History 'Covasna's inclined plane' '('»òiclƒÉul, as it is known locally), was designed by engineer Emil Lux in 1886, at the initiative of lumber mill owner David Horn near the border between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Romania. The railway's main purpose was to increase wood supply and timber transportation. A narrow gauge railway (760 mm) ComandƒÉu - Covasna was therefore built between 1889 and 1891. After two years Horn transferred the concession to forestry company Ardeleana, formerly Erdelyi Erdoipar RT. Ardeleana was founded in 1890 and was owned by Groedel brothers. This company built nine railway systems covering a total of 118.3 km. To enable the connection between Valea Z√¢nelor (Fairy's Valley) and »òiclƒÉu, the Inclined Plane was inaugurated in 1890. The components were manufactured by Viennese firm Obach. The Inclined Plane was used every day for over a century (1892-1995). It transported daily around 30 cars, each having the capacity of 10m¬≥ of wood. In 1995, only a few years after celebrating its centenary, the Inclined Plane underwent a series of unfortunate events when a powerful storm toppled almost all the nearby trees. In addition, in 1997 the top control station was destroyed by fire. A drastic reduction in wood volumes ended the Inclined Plane on 1 October 1999 (along with 32 km of railway that formed the last remains of the forestry railways system from ComandƒÉu). Operation The train operated by allowing the weight of a loaded train to pull a lighter, empty train up the slope. A metal cable connected the two trains. Operation was controlled from the control room located in the top station. Trains ran on a normal track gauge (1435 mm). In the middle of the route a branch allowed the simultaneous passage of the wagons.

In addition to Neum√ºnster, it passed through the district of Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde and Dithmarschen. The most important station on the line is Hohenwestedt. Near Beldorf the line crosses the Gr√ºnental high bridge (Gr√ºnentaler Hochbr√ºcke) over the Kiel Canal. It runs to the eastern side of Heide station and continues as the Heide‚ÄìB√ºsum railway under the Hamburg‚ÄìHusum‚ÄìWesterland railway. History  The Neum√ºnster‚ÄìHeide‚ÄìWeddinghusen‚ÄìKarolinenkoog line was opened on 22 August 1877 by the Westholsteinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (West Holstein Railway Company). In Karolinenkoog a steam ferry connected to the port of T√∂nning in Eiderstedt (see Heide‚ÄìKarolinenkoog railway). In 1878, the company built a branch line was built from Weddinghusen to Wesselburen. This line was extended to B√ºsum in 1883. The Western Holstein railway company was taken over by the Prussian state railways on 1 July 1890. High bridge in about 1900 In 1892, the Gr√ºnental high bridge was built over the Kiel Canal, which was under construction. It was a road bridge with the railway track running down the centre. When rail traffic needed to run over the bridge, it was closed to road traffic by barriers at short notice. In Hohenwestedt, there were connections to the Rendsburg District Railway (Rendsburger Kreisbahn) until 1954 (towards Schenefeld) and until 1956 (towards Rendsburg). In the late 1950s, passenger services included, in addition to stopping trains, a pair of express services on the route from B√ºsum via Heide and Neum√ºnster to Eutin. =1970s until today = Passenger services in the 1970s and 1980s were operated with class 515 railcars and then with less comfortable railbuses because the bridge over the Kiel Canal did not allow for higher axle loads. In 1986, the old Gr√ºnental high bridge was demolished and replaced to its north with a new bridge with the road separated from the rail track. Passenger services on the line were closed around 1990. The line was one of two remaining east‚Äìwest lines in Schleswig-Holstein. In particular, the line was a possible detour route of military strategic importance. After peripheral rationalisation, the operator of the Hamburg-Altona‚ÄìNeum√ºnster railway (AKN Eisenbahn) took over both the operation of rail traffic and the management of the track infrastructure in 1993 from Deutsche Bahn, initially on a trial basis with a ten-year lease. This brought significant upgrades for the wayside stations. Passenger services were operated by AKN with modernised VT A railcars. Current operations Since the timetable change in December 2011, the line has been operated by NBE Nordbahn Eisenbahngesellschaft mbh & Co. KG, a joint subsidiary of AKN Eisenbahn AG and BeNEX GmbH. In 2003, AKN took over the operations of Schleswig-Holstein-Bahn GmbH. Since then, almost all trains have run to B√ºsum. This is reflected in the common timetable route number of 132. The number of trains has been increased on the weekends. Services are operated with LINT 41 railcars. At the time of the acquisition of the SHB by the AKN, it also terminated the lease of the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìHeide line. DB Netz also took over the line‚Äôs maintenance again and straightened the line to remove numerous speed restrictions, which had significantly lengthened travel times. Due to the extended travel times, the scheduled meeting of trains at Heide and Neum√ºnster stations under the regular interval timetable could not be fully achieved.Pro Bahn SHS-22 Freight traffic is no longer carried out on the line. The last freight customers were Lego and some other firms in Hohenwestedt and the Bundeswehr in Albersdorf. Trains run every hour between Hohenwestedt and Neum√ºnster. The total line is, however, served only every two hours. There are numerous stops along the line. In the course of the modernisation of the line, however, the old station building in Wasbek, Aukrug, Osterstedt, Gokels and Nordhastedt were demolished. Hohenwestedt is the only station on the line with a crossing loop. After a short stop in Heide, trains continue to B√ºsum.

It is the second oldest museum of the United States Army, the oldest being the Museum at West Point. History There have been two museum locations. It was first founded in 1905 as the Ordnance Museum, later shutting down during World War I and reopening a few years later. It was renamed in 1919 to the Rock Island Arsenal Museum. The now renamed museum moved to a different location in 1948. Collection The original museum was opened with donations from the 1904 World's Fair and the American Civil War ordnance warehouse. The exhibits are about the people in Arsenal Island's history, its manufacturing processes, and the equipment it has produced. There is a large display of more than 1,100 firearms that were used by the military, both from overseas or within the United States. Five of these weapons were used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Twenty-five percent of the collection's small firearms are not on display, including three rare rifles. Jodean Murdock, education curator, says that the firearms get the most attention from visitors. The museum has a research center located in its basement, containing books, maps, manuals, and magazines, among others. A Children's Discovery Room was created with uniforms and hats for children to try on. Hygrothermographs and a thermostat are used to control the temperature and humidity in the collection rooms so that the items contained within them are not damaged. The museum collections were reduced in 2016, with almost 3,200 pieces being moved to a warehouse operated by the Army. There was also a large reduction in staff. The museum's gift shop went out of business as well due to falling sales.

He matriculated at St. John's College, Oxford on 5 June 1684 and entered Lincoln's Inn on 30 April 1685. In 1694, he was called to the bar. He married Grace Pelham, daughter of Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham on 4 July 1704. He purchased the estate at Hurstmonceaux Castle in 1708. Herstmonceux Castle Naylor was returned unopposed as Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Seaford in the interest of his father-in-law Lord Pelham at a by-election on 12 December 1706. He was returned unopposed at the 1708 general election, and though not a very active member, supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He was defeated at Seaford in a contest at the 1710 general election. His father-in-law, Lord Pelham died in February 1712, and Naylor became an executor and guardian of Pelham's two sons, Thomas, the new Lord Pelham, and Henry.

Clearing the lanes at 6x lights outlane extra ball. Thereafter, completing USA gives players a USA bonus that starts at 100,000 points, and increases by 100,000 each time it is collected, without limit. There are two sets of drop targets; one on the far left (H-A-R) and one in the center, (L-E-Y). completing HAR lights the left spinner for 3,000 points per spin, and completing LEY lights the right. Completing both scores and advances the HARLEY bonus (50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, and 500,000). There are also the DAVIDSON standups. D is on the very left below the drops, A is between the left orbit and left eject, V is in the same spot on the right, and the rest are along the right wall. Completing DAVIDSON lights the speed bonus at the right eject, a hurry-up that starts at 1 million points, and increases by 1 million each time collected. Completing DAVIDSON twice on one ball lights the extra ball at the right eject. Jackpot is also lit here, when players travel across America. The left eject is lit for 25,000 at start of game. Hitting this eject scores and advances the eject hole value (10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 150,000 plus ball lock). Upon locking a ball, right eject lights for lock. Hitting right eject when lit for lock starts multiball. During multiball, completing HARLEY and DAVIDSON scores 5 million, and lights the orbit shots for 1 million each for the rest of multiball. The jackpot is not related to multiball. After the first multiball, the eject hole resets to 10,000 (no lights). There is a third eject on the field, this one is below the IDSON standups, and is impossible to shoot directly. A ball can only bounce in by accident. This awards Speed trap (\\"He's gettin away!\\"), provided it did not land in from a weak plunge, a random mystery value. This can be a score bonus, bonus advance, lighting the speed bonus, losing a tilt warning (\\"Let me see your license... hey, that's a nice bike. Now go on. Git!\\") a traffic ticket (lose 10,000 points) or advance city. Speed bonus, traffic ticker, and tilt warning seem to be most common. It will always award instant multiball if a ball is locked. Locked balls can be stolen in this game. Speed trap is usually awarded only once per ball. Like Fathom, the inlanes are where the outlanes should be, and vice versa. The inlanes and outlanes spell B-I-K-E. Lighting BIKE (lane change works here too) spots a city (\\"Harley spotted in \\"), and scores the BIKE bonus (50,000). B and I light the right orbit, and K or E lights the left. Hitting a LIT orbit lets the ball go all the way around the loop, and awards a city plus 50,000 points, just like spelling BIKE. It also lights the orbit players have shot for one million (\\"One Million...\\"). Shooting an unlit orbit feeds the jets, and lights that orbit. Lit orbits and millions time out after 10 or 15 seconds. A ball that goes up a LIT orbit and trickles back down usually awards two cities, depending on speed (one for the return trip) A ball that goes up and down an unlit orbit will award one. Lighting all cities lights jackpot (e.g. \\"Harley spotted in Laconia, heading for jackpot\\"). Jackpot has a minimum of 5 million points, and is progressively increased by the jet bumpers. Subsequent jackpots are multiplied. Thus, the second jackpot is a double jackpot, the third is a triple jackpot, and so on. Hitting an unlit eject hole (other than the left one) gives players a rest stop bonus, which starts at 30,000 or so and goes up 5,000 each time.

OECD Publishing uses a freemium model by making its books available online in HTML with the option to purchase a print copy. There is some evidence that making electronic editions of books open access can increase sales of the print edition. History While open access to journal articles has become very common, with 50% of articles published in 2011 available as open access, open access to books has not yet seen as much uptake. However, there are dedicated open-access book publishers such as Open Book Publishers, punctum books, and others who publish both books and journals, such as Open Humanities Press. A report released in 2015 by the UK's main funding body for research, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, states the importance of open access monographs: \\"Monographs are a vitally important and distinctive vehicle for research communication, and must be sustained in any moves to open access.\\" The OAPEN (Open Access Publishing in European Networks) online library and publication platform provides access to thousands of peer-reviewed academic books, mainly in the humanities and social sciences. The OAPEN Foundation also provides a directory of open access works via Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB).

The 1971 NCAA champion at 880 yards, Winzenried narrowly missed qualifying for the American Olympic team in 1968 and was favored to qualify in 1972 until an injured Achilles tendon spoiled his chances. He held the indoor world best at the unusual distance of 1000 yards from 1972 to 1981, and still holds the world junior best in another non-standard event, 600 meters. Career =1968= Winzenried became a top half-miler in 1968 while a freshman at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He placed second to Oregon Track Club's Wade Bell at the 1968 national championships in Sacramento, California, running 1:46.5, then his personal best. The United States Olympic Trials in 1968 were divided in two parts, with a semi-final meet in Los Angeles in late June and the final Trials at altitude in Echo Summit two and a half months later. Winzenried placed third behind Bell and Felix Johnson in the June meet, clocking 1:46.9; he had led at the bell in 51.5, but faded toward the end. The unusual distance of 600 m was contested in a warm-up meet two weeks before the final Olympic Trials, and Winzenried took part. He placed third to quarter-milers Lee Evans and Larry James, with Evans setting a new world best of 1:14.3; James was second in 1:14.6, and Winzenried's time of 1:14.8 was also well below the previous world best. , his time still remains the junior (under-20) world best for the distance. Like the Trials themselves, the warm-up meet was held at altitude in Echo Summit. At the final Trials, Winzenried narrowly missed out on making the team. He again led after the first lap (52.8), but was overtaken first by Tom Farrell (who would go on to win bronze at the Olympics) and then by Bell; again fading, he battled for the third and final Olympic spot with Ron Kutschinski down the final straight and eventually lost by a tenth of a second, 1:47.8 to 1:47.9. =1969‚Äì1971= Winzenried placed fifth at 880 yards at the 1969 NCAA championships in Knoxville; his time of 1:46.6 was equivalent to 1:45.9 or 1:46.0 for 800 meters and his personal best. He won his first NCAA title in 1970, winning the indoor 880 yards in 1:51.7. He placed fourth at that year's NCAA outdoor championships, won by Ken Swenson of Kansas State University. At the national (AAU) championships he finished a close second to Swenson, with both clocking the same time and Swenson winning by \\"an eyelash\\", in the words of The Sheboygan Press Winzenried's second place qualified him to represent the United States in a series of dual meets in Europe in July 1970, including one against West Germany in Stuttgart. In the Stuttgart race he set the pace for most of the way; although he eventually only placed fourth, his time of 1:45.6 was his personal best and would remain so. The winner, Swenson, was clocked in 1:44.8, an American record for the metric distance, although Jim Ryun had run an intrinsically superior 1:44.9 for the longer 880-yard run. Track & Field News ranked Winzenried the fifth-best 800 m runner in the world in 1970, and second only to Swenson among Americans. Winzenried repeated as NCAA indoor champion in 1971, clocking 1:50.9 for 880 yards. He also won his first and only outdoor NCAA title, triumphing in the final in 1:48.8 after running conservatively in the earlier rounds; he was the only senior in the final, and Wisconsin's only winner. However, he only placed fifth at that year's national championships; Track & Field News ranked him tenth in the world and second (to Juris Luzins) in the United States in its 1971 rankings. =Later career and injuries= Winzenried's good form continued in 1972, and he broke the indoor world best at the unusual distance of 1000 yards at the Mason-Dixon Games in Louisville, Kentucky on February 12, his time of 2:05.1 beating Ralph Doubell's 1970 record of 2:05.5 by four-tenths of a second. Winzenried's record lasted for almost nine years until Don Paige ran 2:04.9 in February 1981. Winzenried ran his first four-minute mile (3:59.5) in Los Angeles on March 4. Entering the 1972 Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, he had the fastest time of any American at 800 meters that year (1:46.6) and was considered likely to make the team. However, he injured his Achilles tendon at the national championships two weeks before the Trials; he attempted to run at the Trials despite the injury, but only placed fifth in his heat and failed to make the semi-finals. He considered making another attempt at qualifying at his second-best distance, 1500 meters, but eventually scratched from that race. Although Winzenried continued competing after 1972, he was never world- ranked again. He made another push at the Olympics four years later, but re- injured his Achilles tendon in late March 1976 and, unable to train properly, had to abandon his attempt. He was inducted in the Wisconsin Badgers Hall of Fame in 2005.

The bill is a response to the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014, in which it was discovered that there was systematic lying about the wait times veterans experienced waiting to be seen by doctors.Griffin, Richard J., Acting Inspector General, Interim Report: Review of Patient Wait Times, Scheduling Practices, and Alleged Patient Deaths at the Phoenix Health Care System, VA Office of Inspector General, Veterans Health Administration, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, May 28, 2014, 14-02603-178, Washington, D.C., retrieved June 7, 2014 By June 5, 2014, Veterans Affairs internal investigations had identified a total of 35 veterans who had died while waiting for care in the Phoenix VHA system. Another audit determined that \\"more than 57,000 veterans waited at least 90 days to see a doctor, while another 63,000 over the last decade never received an initial appointment.\\" The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background CNN reported on April 30, 2014 that at least 40 United States Armed Forces veterans died while waiting for care at the Phoenix, Arizona, Veterans Health Administration facilities. By June 5, 2014, Veterans Affairs internal investigations had identified a total of 35 veterans who had died while waiting for care in the Phoenix VHA system. An investigation of delays in treatment throughout the Veterans Health Administration system is being conducted by the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General, and the House has passed legislation to fund a $1 million criminal investigation by the Justice Department. On May 16, 2014, the Veterans Health Administration's top health official, Dr. Robert Petzel, retired early at the request of Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. On May 30, 2014, Secretary Shinseki, himself, resigned from office amid the fallout from the controversy.Obama, Barack, President of the United States,\\"Statement by the President, May 30, 2014, Office of the Press Secretary, The White House, retrieved June 7, 2014 As of early June 2014, several other VA medical centers around the nation have been identified with the same problems as the Phoenix facility, and the investigations by the VA Inspector General, the Congress and others are widening.

The Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 would, in section 2, direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to enter into contracts with such non-VA facilities as may be necessary to furnish hospital care and medical services to veterans who: :*have waited longer than the wait-time goals of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) (as of June 1, 2014) for an appointment for hospital care or medical services in a VA facility; :*have been notified by a VA facility that an appointment for hospital care or medical services is not available within such wait-time goals; or :*reside more than 40 miles from the VA medical facility, including a community-based outpatient clinic, that is closest to their residence. The bill would allow eligible veterans who opt for hospital care or medical services in a non-VA facility to receive such care or services through the completion of the episode of care, but for no longer than 60 days. The bill would direct the Secretary to submit a quarterly report to Congress on the provision of such hospital care and medical services through contracts with non-VA facilities. The bill would terminate the Secretary's authority to contract with non-VA facilities for the provision of such care and services two years after this Act's enactment. Section 3 would direct the Secretary, to the extent that appropriations are available to the VHA for medical services, to reimburse non-VA facilities with which the VA does not have such a contract for providing hospital care and medical services to such veterans, if such care and services cannot be provided within the VHA's wait-time goals in a facility with which the VA has a contract. Sets the reimbursement rate for such care or services at the greatest of the VA, Medicare, or TRICARE (a Department of Defense [DOD] managed care program) payment rate for such care or services. The bill would terminate the Secretary's authority to reimburse non-VA facilities for the provision of such care and services two years after this Act's enactment. Section 4 would direct the Secretary, within 120 days of this Act's enactment, to enter into a contract or contracts with a private entity or entities with experience in VHA and private delivery systems and in health care management to conduct an independent assessment of the hospital care and medical services furnished in VA facilities. The bill would list the factors that must be addressed in assessing veterans access to, and the quality of, hospital care and medical services in VA facilities. The bill would direct the Secretary to submit reports to the congressional veterans committees regarding: (1) the findings and recommendations of the independent assessment; and (2) the Secretary's response to those findings, including an action plan for fully implementing such recommendations. Section 5 would prohibit the Secretary from paying awards and bonuses to VA employees for FY2014-FY2016. Section 6 would require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), within 30 days of this Act's enactment, to transmit to Congress: :*an estimate of the budgetary effects of this Act's coverage of hospital care and medical services for veterans in non-VA facilities; :*any transfer authority needed to utilize the savings from denying VA awards and bonuses to satisfy such budgetary effects; and :*a request, if necessary, for additional funding, or the transfer or reprogramming of existing funding, for this Act's coverage of the hospital care and medical services provided to veterans in non-VA facilities. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. H.R. 4810 would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase the provision of health care by contracting out to non-VA providers. For that purpose, the Secretary would be able to use available appropriations. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) anticipates that this bill would make available some appropriated funds that would otherwise lapse - an estimated $620 million over the 2014-2016 period. In addition to those direct spending costs shown above, the bill would also substantially increase spending for veterans' health care, if sufficient appropriations were provided for that purpose. The CBO has not completed an estimate of the discretionary costs. Procedural history The Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 9, 2014 by Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. On June 20, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in Roll Call Vote 287 by a vote of 426-0. This was actually the second vote the House made on the bill because some members who missed the first vote asked for a re-vote so that they could be on the record in support of the bill. One of the Representatives who missed the vote did so because he was recovering from brain surgery. The Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 was received in the United States Senate on June 11, 2014 and was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. On June 11, 2014, the Senate passed its own VA reform bill, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014. Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Jeff Miller said that \\"many of the provisions included in today's Senate-passed bill are based on ideas that have already cleared the House, so I'm hopeful both chambers of Congress can soon agree on a final package to send to the president's desk.\\" Debate and discussion Rep. Jeff Miller, who sponsored the bill, said that the wait times veterans were forced to face was \\"a national disgrace.\\" Rep. Michael Michaud (D-ME) argued that the care veterans receive at the VA is not the problem, but the wait times were. Michaud stated that \\"we often hear that the care veterans receive at the VA facilities is second to none. That is, if you can get in... Tens of thousands of veterans are not getting in.\\" Rep. Julia Brownley (D-CA) argued that the legislation should consider time as well as distance when it came to allowing veterans to visit non-VA medical centers. Brownley argued that \\"those of us who represent urban areas like Southern California we all know that 40 miles can take the better part of a day to traverse back and forth.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities *Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4810 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4810 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4810 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4810 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4810 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4810 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014"},{"id":"43017928","text":"Friends of the Los Angeles River (FoLAR) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in California in 1986, whose mission is to protect and restore the natural and historic heritage of the Los Angeles River and its riparian habitat.

The first storm, Eline, formed on February 1, and took an extended track across the Indian Ocean, eventually making landfall near Mahanoro on February 17\\\\. On March 1, Gloria struck northeastern Madagascar, and like Eline, moved southwestward across the country. Meteorological history Ahead of the primary flooding in February 2000, a tropical disturbance persisted off the west coast of Madagascar in January. Rains from the system helped end previous drought conditions, while also causing flooding and damage. In Morombe, precipitation from the system reached the equivalence of the annual rainfall in just 36 hours. On February 1, a low- pressure area formed within the monsoon trough to the south of Indonesia, which would eventually become Tropical Cyclone Leon. The storm tracked westward across much of the Indian Ocean, fluctuating in strength due to changes in the atmosphere. After crossing 90¬∞ E, the M√©t√©o-France (MFR) began tracking the system as Tropical Storm Eline. The storm continued westward across the Indian Ocean and intensified greatly as it approached the east coast of Madagascar. Late on February 17, Eline made landfall near Mahanoro, with 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) according to the MFR. The storm rapidly weakened over land, but eventually restrengthened in the Mozambique Channel to make another damaging landfall in Mozambique. Eline dropped heavy rainfall in Madagascar, with a 24‚Äëhour total of at Ivato International Airport near the capital Antananarivo. The rains also caused flooding along Madagascar's west coast, which is usually spared from precipitation by mountains. Eline struck while Madagascar was in the midst of a cholera epidemic that had killed over 1,000 people. While Eline was dissipating over southern Africa, another area of disturbed weather formed to the northeast of Madagascar, becoming a tropical disturbance on February 27\\\\. Moving generally westward toward the country, it intensified into Tropical Storm Gloria on March 1\\\\. Later that day, the MFR estimated that the storm reached peak 10 minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), before Gloria made landfall about 10 km (6 mi) north of Sambava. The storm moved southwestward across the country, gradually weakening and eventually moving into the Mozambique Channel. Gloria brought additional heavy rainfall to Madagascar, with Mananjary reporting a two-day total of . Nosy Be along the northwest coast recorded a 24‚Äëhour rainfall total of , which is over half the average monthly precipitation. Mananjary reported a two-day total of . Later, Gloria produced sporadic rainfall in southern Madagascar, in part due to increased humidity. Impact The rains from Gloria occurred less than two weeks after Cyclone Leon‚ÄìEline struck the country, bringing additional flooding, landslides, and damage. In the area where Gloria moved ashore, several communities were temporarily isolated due to the flooding. In Sambava, near where Gloria moved ashore, the storm killed 18 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and damaged a road connecting the area to the capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo. Across the region, the floods destroyed at least 30 bridges, many of them wooden, and damaged 100 km (60 mi) of roads. In the region around Vatomandry, where Eline made landfall, 65% of houses were damaged, 90% of crops were lost, and 75% of health facilities were wrecked; about 10,000 people there were left homeless. The floods also affected the west coast of Madagascar. In Morombe along the southwest coast, about one-third of buildings were destroyed and many others were damaged, with 1,600 people left homeless in that area. The west coast is usually unaffected by cyclones striking from the east coast, which left several communities unprepared. Fields were inundated for over a week, causing severe losses to coffee and banana crops. Thousands of hectares of rice paddy fields were flooded. The flooding destroyed many cash crops, thus depriving a poor region with a source of income, as well as threatening food supply. Floods from the two storm inundated 70% of homes and wrecked 70% of the crops in the districts of Andapa, Sambava, Antalaha, and Vohemar. Up to half of the rice harvest in the country was lost during the floods. About 12,000 people were isolated by floods in 114 villages. Overall, about 700,000 people were directly impacted by the floods. Collectively, 12,230 people were left without access to clean water. The government of Madagascar reported that cyclones Eline and Gloria killed 64 and 66 people, respectively, although the exact toll was initially unknown due to disrupted communications. Cyclone Gloria alone killed 40 people at Andapa. Overall, at least 205 people were killed. Damage from Eline alone was estimated at $9 million (USD). Aftermath Immediately after Eline struck Madagascar, the government began distributing relief items, such as rice, tents, and sheets. On February 21, survey flights helped indicate the extent of damage across the nation. Supplies were distributed by road from Antananarivo to the worst affected areas, with helicopters dropping off aid to isolated communities. However, poor road infrastructure, residual flooding, and landslides caused difficulties in distributing aid. In addition, many of the affected residents were in remote regions of the country, further complicating relief efforts. By the middle of March 2000, flooding had largely receded, leaving behind mud and dead animals along roads and fields. However, about 60,000 people in northeastern Madagascar remained isolated as of March 17. Road access was gradually restored to the hardest hit areas, allowing relief distribution to shift from air to land more. The Fianarantsoa-C√¥te Est railway, damaged during the storm, took three months to be reopened. The lack of road or rail prevented farmers from selling crops that hadn't been destroyed during the storms. By March 21, the situation was no longer life-threatening, although food distribution was still required due to the ruined rice harvest. Costs for rice in some parts of the country doubled due to the flooding. In addition, houses were gradually rebuilt. On April 2, around a month after Gloria struck Madagascar, Cyclone Hudah also struck the country, causing an additional 111 deaths and heavy damage. The floods caused outbreaks of malaria and cholera while also decreasing food supplies. In the month after Eline struck, 384 people died due to cholera, representing a 39% increase in the death toll in that time period, after there were 22,000 new cases of the disease. However, officials in the country stated the increase was not due to the storms' flooding, but rather from poor hygiene conditions and the start of the rainy season. In addition, the Malagasy government prevented foreign non-governmental organizations from treating cholera patients, causing M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res to leave the country in late February. Due to the combined impacts of Eline and Gloria, the government of Madagascar requested for international assistance on March 7, which was coordinated through the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The government believed that the flooding in Mozambique, also caused by Eline, was receiving more international attention, and sought more assistance. On March 12, then-Prime Minister Tantely Andrianarivo flew over the northeast portion of the country to survey the damage, as well as hold a religious ceremony for the storm victims. After receiving request from the Malagasy government, UNICEF flew 15 tons of supplies from Copenhagen, such as medicine, 10.5 tons of food, and equipment to help coordinate relief work. The agency also transported thousands of blankets and water purification tablets from Antananarivo. However, UNICEF faced difficulties in distributing the supplies. The government of the United Kingdom donated ¬£1.3 million to Madagascar. The World Food Programme flew about 400 tons of food to affected residents across the country, and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res sent about 35 tons of supplies, such as medicine, water purifying devices, and food. The Organisation of African Unity donated $200,000 to Madagascar on March 10, and five days later, the African Development Bank approved a $500,000 grant to the country. Beginning on March 13, the French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (R97) began sending six helicopters to drop off 27 tons' worth of aid. The Netherlands Red Cross donated 40 tons of supplies, including medical kits, blankets, and plastic sheets. For the 2001 fiscal year, the United States Agency for International Development provided $14 million (USD) to Madagascar, mostly toward rebuilding damaged roads and ports.

The resort was formerly known as the Maui Prince Hotel, and was designed by Anbe, Aruga, and Ishizu architects. It was opened in August 1986 and subsequently sold in July 2010 to AREA Property Partners. It had several hundred rooms and suites leading to an open-air atrium and outdoor pools built around an Asian meditation garden with waterfalls. In July 2016, the resort owner, ATC Makena Holdings LLC, announced that it was closing the hotel to redevelop the property into a luxury condominium community called the Makena Golf and Beach Club. History Seibu Hawaii, Inc. a Japanese company, acquired a prime beachfront parcel of land in Makena in 1983. The design by Anbe, Aruga, and Ishizu architects of Honolulu and the opening of the Maui Prince Hotel resort followed in August 1986. About 1,300 acres of land surrounding the hotel and golf courses were kept in their natural state. The Seibu Group of Japan operated the Maui Prince Hotel resort until 2007. It was then acquired by Maui developers and investors Everett Dowling and Morgan Stanley who tried unsuccessfully to run it until September 2009. The hotel was subsequently sold in July 2010 to a group of investors led by AREA Property Partners, Trinity Investments LLC, and Stanford Carr Development LLC. Then Landmark Hotels Group, Inc. took control of its management until January 2012 and renamed it the Makena Beach & Golf Resort with Declan McCarthy as the current General Manager. The resort, located near the Wailea Golf Courses, had 290 rooms and 20 suites. There were two outdoor pools (one for adults, one for children), an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., six tennis courts, a fitness room, a Jacuzzi, water sports assistance, a shopping arcade, a salon, and in-room massage. In addition, the Makena Kai Day Spa was operated by Hawaiian Rainforest Spa which specializes in Hawaiian healing arts and provides massage therapy, facials, and body treatments. The resort had four restaurants and two bars (with local Hawaiian music nightly). In 2014, a group led by Hawaii developer Stanford Carr expressed to the Maui Planning Commission the intention to transform the resort into luxury apartments and hotel. In 2016, it was announced by ATC Makena Holdings, LLC, owners of the 1,800-acre Makena Resort, that it would close the 310-room Makena Beach & Golf Resort (formerly the Maui Prince Hotel) at noon on July 1.

The title, which is a follow-up game of the 2005 Nintendo DS title Kirby: Canvas Curse, was released by Nintendo on January 22, 2015 in Japan, February 20, 2015 in North America, May 8, 2015 in Europe and May 9, 2015 in Australia. The game supports the Kirby, Meta Knight, and King Dedede Amiibo. Gameplay A pre-release gameplay screenshot of Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. Kirby follows a line drawn on the Wii U GamePad and collects stars scattered around levels to activate the \\"Star Dash\\" power-up. Kirby and the Rainbow Curse carries on the style of gameplay from Canvas Curse, presenting the game with a unique modelling clay look. Players use the Wii U GamePad to help Kirby, who is stuck in a ball form, move across the level by drawing rainbow colored lines on the touchscreen to guide him. Making Kirby go through loops will speed him up, while touching him will put him into a spinning attack to use against enemies. For every 100 stars Kirby collects, Kirby can perform a Star Dash which increases his size, allowing him to charge through normally-indestructible blocks. Similarly to Kirby's Epic Yarn, Kirby can gain various forms throughout the game, such as a submarine, a rocket, and a tank. These forms help him progress through the game and provide certain elements that alters the gameplay. Up to three additional players using Wii Remotes can play as Waddle Dees, who can assist Kirby by carrying him around and attacking enemies and can also perform charged attacks. During these levels, an evil hand may try to capture Kirby, with only the Waddle Dees able to damage it. Each level contains several hidden treasure chests, some of which requires solving a puzzle or clearing a timed room, which unlock viewable clay figures and music tracks, as well as diary pages detailing Elline's journey. The main story mode in Kirby and the Rainbow Curse has 28 levels, while challenge mode has over 40. The game features amiibo support with the Kirby, King Dedede, and Meta Knight figures from the Super Smash Bros. range. The Kirby figure allows Kirby to activate the \\"Star Dash\\" ability at any time, the King Dedede figure gives Kirby extra hitpoints, and the Meta Knight figure gives him greater attack power during his touch-activated spinning attack. Plot One day in Dream Land, as Kirby and Bandana Waddle Dee are playing together, a mysterious hole opens in the sky, draining all the color from Dream Land and stopping everything and everyone in its tracks. Elline, a paintbrush fairy from the land of Seventopia, goes through the portal in order to escape several \\"grab hands\\" and uses her powers to bring color back to Kirby and Bandana Waddle Dee. She reveals that her best friend, Claycia, suddenly became evil and has used the colors from Kirby's planet, Pop Star, in order to create seven worlds. Wanting to stop Claycia and restore Planet Popstar's color, Kirby, Bandana Waddle Dee, and Elline set off to Seventopia, Elline painting magical rainbow rope. Kirby is stuck in a ball form similar to Kirby: Canvas Curse. On the last world's final boss stage, it is revealed that Claycia had been possessed by an evil force known as the Dark Crafter, who has the urge to drain all of the color in a specific place. After Kirby pursues the Dark Crafter and manages to defeat it, he, Bandana Waddle Dee, Claycia, and Elline all return to Dream Land and bring back all of the missing color into Planet Popstar. The ending scene includes Claycia and Elline making a bushel of apples for Kirby to eat. Development When they first saw the Wii U GamePad, the developers realized they could incorporate asymmetric multiplayer into the new Kirby game and decided that, while Wii Remote players would have a more traditional running-and-jumping platformer experience, the GamePad player would draw \\"footholds\\". They decided to use the same line-drawing gameplay from Kirby: Canvas Curse. The Wii U game's polymer clay art style was chosen to create a more three-dimensional version of the DS game's painterly style, while the framerate of the animations was kept low so the game would look like it was made in claymation. Waddle Dees were chosen as the multiplayer characters because the developers felt that Meta Knight or King Dedede were not as well-suited to protect Kirby. Reception Kirby and the Rainbow Curse received mixed to positive reviews. It received an aggregated score of 75% on GameRankings based on 50 reviews and 73/100 on Metacritic based on 72 reviews. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu awarded Kirby and the Rainbow Curse a 34 out of 40, with one reviewer stating \\"Although guiding a character by drawing lines with the GamePad isn‚Äôt a new mechanism in itself, the game deserves applause for making that mechanism more interesting to play. The visuals are cute and look like clay animation. The game is filled with a surprisingly diverse load of gimmicks so it excites in many ways. The game is packed with the true charm of action games.\\" Giant Bomb's Dan Ryckert gave Kirby and the Rainbow Curse two stars out of five, comparing the title negatively to its DS predecessor. He felt that the levels were too simple and linear, with collectibles too easy to reach. He disliked that Kirby could not steal enemies' abilities like in Canvas Curse, and thought that the vehicles Kirby could turn into made certain levels \\"even more stripped-down.\\" While he found the controls functional, the repetitive boss fights were frustrating due to the stylus' lack of precision. Ryckert preferred to play as a Waddle Dee, whose traditional control scheme afforded more reliable platforming and boss fighting than the \\"unreliable stylus paths\\" provided. However, Ryckert did find the clay-based art style \\"gorgeous.\\" IGN's Marty Sliva found the game much more enjoyable, awarding it 8.0 out of 10. He appreciated the game's occasional difficulty and its variety, finding the vehicular stages enjoyable and the various world themes beautiful. Sliva thought that the visuals were \\"absolutely gorgeous,\\" praising details like fingerprints in the clay and the stop-motion movements of the bosses, but was disappointed that he had to focus on the GamePad instead of an HDTV. He found that Waddle Dee multiplayer did not \\"add a whole lot to the experience,\\" but it was \\"a nice experiment to test out.\\" Nintendo Life's Jon Walgren gave Rainbow Curse seven stars out of ten. He found the game \\"charming\\" and its visuals to be \\"the prettiest [...] on Wii U so far,\\" but was disappointed that the clay aesthetic did not influence the gameplay like the fabric did in Kirby's Epic Yarn. He thought the main campaign was easy, but the Challenge Mode and the search for collectibles provided a bit more difficulty. Like other reviewers, Walgren would have liked to see the game in high definition but found he had to focus on the GamePad's low-definition screen. Playing with others was \\"pleasant,\\" but it was not the best local mutliplayer experience on Wii U. Hardcore Gamer's Dermot Creegan gave the game a 4.5 out of 5, calling it a \\"constantly creative adventure that offers players something they won‚Äôt find anywhere else.\\" He praised the claymation aesthetic calling them \\"astoundingly beautiful,\\" while also complimenting the number of collectibles and challenges. = Sales = Nearly one month after its release in Japan, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse had sold roughly 58,000 units, with 83,000 copies sold by the end of June 2015.

Some botanists consider it a distinct species, while others have argued it is simply an unusual variety of the common apple, Malus pumila. Niedzwetzky's apple is rare, often growing as an isolated tree, and is endangered throughout its range by agricultural encroachment and logging operations. Only 111 specimens of the tree are known to survive in Kyrgyzstan. The conservation group Fauna & Flora International is working to save and restore the species in that country, and has put M. niedzwetzkyana on its endangered list, brought it under its Global Trees Campaign, and planted over 1000 saplings in area forests in 2010 and 2011 The tree was introduced to the West c. 1890 by Georg Dieck at the Z√∂schen Arboretum, Germany, who grew it from seed sent by the Russian lawyer and amateur botanist Vladislav E. Niedzwiecki living in exile in Turkestan; Dieck later donated specimens to the Sp√§th nursery, which exported the tree to the USA c. 1896.Hansen, N. How to produce that $1000 premium apple, in Minnesota State Hort. Soc. (1900). Trees, fruits & flowers of Minnesota. Vol. 28. 470-1. Forgotten Books, London, 2013. Description flowers of M. niedzwetzkyana The tree is winter-hardy and drought-resistant, growing tall in the wild (<5 m under cultivation), with a globular crown and very dark purplish-brown bark. New shoots are dark purple, and leaves range from purplish when new to dark green when mature. In the spring it puts out intensely magenta-rose flowers that are up to 4 inches in diameter. The skin of the fruit is deep red to purple-red (sometimes with a bluish, waxy bloom) and the flesh ranges from light to bright red, with dark reddish-brown seeds. The fruit is edible and not very tart, with dry, somewhat chewy flesh. In the Kashgar region of China near the Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan borders, it is known as 'kisil alma': 'red apple'. Cultivation Malus niedzwetzkyana has been used to breed some modern red-leaved, red-flowered, and red-fruited apples and crabapples. It is believed to be the ancestor of Surprise, a pink- fleshed apple that was brought to the United States by German immigrants around 1840 and was later used by the horticulturist Albert Etter to breed some 30 pink- and red-fleshed varieties, the best-known of which is Pink Pearl. Another horticulturist, Niels Ebbesen Hansen, encountered M. niedzwetzkyana in the Ili valley, where he also met Niedzwetzky, in what was then the Russian region of Turkestan (but now Kazakhstan) during his 1897 expedition. Hansen began two breeding programs based on this unusual fruit, one aimed at developing a cold-hardy cooking and eating apple, and the other aimed at developing ornamental crabapples. His efforts resulted in the Almata apple and the Hopa crabapple, among other varieties. Some of these apples, as well as M. niedzwetzkyana itself, are being used for small-scale commercial production of ros√© apple ciders. =Cultivars= * 'Red Vein'.Moffet, L. (1931).

In the twentieth century Azerbaijani musician Mirza Sadigh (also known as Sadighjan) made some changes by increasing number of strings to18. Then he reduces strings to 13. In order to strengthen the sound effects, he reduced the depth of the body part by flattening the sides. In 1932, Uzeyir Hajibeyov created an orchestra consisted of Azerbaijani folk instruments. The first tar and kamancha concerts with symphony orchestra were arranged by Haji Khanmammadov. Nowadays, Farkhad Khudyev and Imamyar Hasanov are well-known Azerbaijani kamancha players. In 2013, Farkhad Khudyev performed concert for kamancha with the Youth Music Monterrey County Symphony Orchestra from California dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the Khamammadov‚Äôs Symphony Orchestra.

The current building dates to the early 19th-century and is Grade II* listed as well as being the southernmost man- made structure in Cumbria. Completed in 1804, the stone lighthouse and its attached cottages actually predate Barrow and its port. The structure was built to replace a smaller wooden lighthouse that was constructed by the Lancaster Quay Commissioners in 1790 to aid in navigation towards the docks at Glasson close to Lancaster and the River Lune. It contained three reflectors mounted on a slowly-revolving shaft; the reflectors consisted of a concave wooden frame covered with small pieces of mirrored glass. The original lighthouse was destroyed by fire in 1803 and was swiftly replaced by the lighthouse of today. The lighthouse was designed by engineer E. Dawson. The optical system (as renewed in 1846) was a clockwork-driven rotating array of four Argand lamps backed by parabolic reflectors, which gave a white flash once a minute.

In the 1920s, the legal scholar Yevgeny Bronislawowitsch Paschukanis foreshadowed the debate with his explanation of the legal form of the commodity. Important writers in this area since 1970 are Rudolf Wolfgang M√ºller, Christel Neus√º√ü, Bernhard Blanke, Elmar Altvater, Freerk Huisken, Joachim Hirsch and the class analysis project (including Joachim Bischoff).  Debate  The debate was considered a branch of New Marx Reading and took place primarily among academicians, but also arose from political situation. After the electoral victory in 1969 of a social-liberal coalition in Germany, many on the left hoped for social reforms and sought a revision of institutions and a reform of society by means of the state. Within the state-derivation debate the state is seen as a \\"structural component of the capitalist relations of production itself, its specific political form. The capitalist classes and relations of exploitation are set up so that the economically ruling class do not rule directly but their rule can only be realized by means of a body that is relatively separate, the state. At the same time, the structural and functional logic of capitalism remains in control. The state does not stand outside and independent of capital. The bourgeois state is therefore a class-state without being the direct instrument of a class. And this particularization 'or' relative autonomy 'of the state is the basis of the state illusion. \\"(Joachim Hirsch)Tote Hunde wecken? Interview mit Joachim Hirsch zur Staatstheorie und Staatsableitung , Arranca!, Nr. 24, 2002 = Criticism = Rainer-Olaf Schultze has argued that the derivative- debate remains \\"mostly in the conceptual logical domain of the interpretation of the Marxist classics\\" and failed \\"to deliver the necessary mediation for the concrete analysis of the reality of capitalist states.\\" ‚ÄûAbleitung‚Äú von Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; in: Nohlen, Dieter; Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Lexikon der Politikwissenschaft. Theorien, Methoden, Begriffe, 2. Aufl. (2004) Similarly, Frank Deppe suggests that the state-derivation debate 'was a typical example of a - largely detached from practice and finally only self-reflexive - \\"academic Marxism\\", especially focusing on the state - given the importance of civil society in the sense of Gramsci - involves a narrowing of the political concept\\".Oder auch: Vor allem in der sog. ‚ÄûStaatsableitungsdebatte‚Äú der 70er Jahre stand das Bem√ºhen um die ‚Äûrichtige Ableitung‚Äú des Staates aus dem [Anm.: marxschen] ‚ÄûKapital‚Äú im Zentrum. Diese Debatte verlief sich bald in hoch abstrakte Elaborate, deren Bezug zur wirklichen Bewegung und zu den K√§mpfen der Zeit kaum noch nachzuvollziehen war.

Also, the time in the debate decisively involved Joachim Hirsch conceded later, \\"that the state derivation debate was conducted on a highly abstract level and sometimes the direction became a form of theoretical tiddly winks\\". On the other hand, according to Hirsch, however, in many cases the status of the debate has been misunderstood, in which it had not gone to a finished theory of the state, but the shape determination of civil society as part of a broader historical theory.

He was most notably affiliated as a curator with The Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio. As a university educator, he has worked at Youngstown State University and Penn State University. Pernotto is dually known as a canvas painter and paper sculptor. His works have been described as post-post- modern arte povera. He currently resides in Youngstown, Ohio.  Career in the 1960s and early 1970s  As a student Ohio State University, Pernotto was highly influenced by the pop-art of Rauschenberg, Warhol, and Lichtenstein rendering images from comic books and editorial photography into satirical collage. At that point, he began being featured in national shows including shows at the Print Club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and ColorPrint USA at Texas Tech University.  Career in the 1970s and 1980s  During this time, Pernotto lived in Madison, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C., and worked primarily in painting on hand-made paper, teaching workshops at Parson‚Äôs School of Design in Lake Placid, New York, and Rutgers University. He was exposed to Chicago imagist painters and non-figurative painters such as Alan Shields and Sam Gilliam whom greatly influenced Pernotto's involvement in Arte Povre. He received his MFA in 1975 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Pernotto's most notable work from this period was a travelling museum commissioned in 1977 by the Madison Art Center entitled ‚ÄúKing Toot.‚Äù This exhibition was a complete sculptural parody of the King Tutankhamun exhibition updated with contemporary artifacts such as the Barbie Selket, Coke adds Ankh vase. King Toot travelled to the International Art Exposition at Navy Pier in Chicago in 1982. Pernotto was featured in the Fendrick Gallery, Allan Frumkin Gallery, and Carl Solway Gallery during this period. He earned a fellowship at PS1 International Studio Program (now MoMA PS1) in 1987.  Career in the 1990s and 2000s  During this period, Pernotto transitioned from painting on hand-made paper to painting primarily on canvas. Initially, paintings were inspired by previously created illustrated book pages in a palimpsest fashion. His work was featured at the Center for Book Arts. He was awarded a 1994 Ohio Arts Council Fellowship and a 1994 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. That year, he moved to New York City, and a shift in focus occurred as Science and Technology now combined with History to drive his work. While in New York City, Pernotto kept a small studio space in the East Village and a studio in the Bronx. Inspired by the book The Mayan Factor by Jose Arguelles, Pernotto began weaving together time and space within his images. Pernotto was the conceptual driving force in the founding of Pacifico Fine Art Gallery on Hudson Street in Greenwich Village, which exhibited emerging and mid-career artists, and operated from 1999 to 2001. In 2004, Pernotto moved back to his original studio in his hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, where he resumed art production and began the process of documenting his collection. In 2006, The Butler Institute of American Art asked that he exhibit a retrospective show of his works which he entitled ‚ÄúMEME.‚Äù In 2009, received a Juror‚Äôs Choice award for his acrylic/photo/wood work titled ‚ÄúS.A.L.T.: Germs, Steel,‚Äù which depicts a gritty scene from the local steel industry. Pernotto is just one of several area artists whose works appear in the show.  Career from 2010-present  In 2010, Pernotto launched NEXT Best Art, a non-profit with the mission to create an independently run public gallery, considering the juncture of art and physics, to educate and enhance the cultural community of Downtown Youngstown. Next Best Art is working to establish a home within the Mahoning Valley to embrace the opportunity for a consistent cultural dialogue with the greater worldwide art forum. In a featured story about Jim Pernotto in the Youngstown Vindicator on August 9th, 2014, Editor Todd Franko discusses his downtown apartment and workspace as \\"It‚Äôs a fantastic loft space right out of Hollywood central casting for an artist/Bohemian type like Pernotto.\\" The article linked here shows Pernotto's passion for art, Youngstown and especially the downtown urban area, and linking continued development with using art as a vehicle. On January 10th, 2016, Pernotto will be celebrating the opening of his latest show at the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown Ohio. The show titled \\"Merkaba\\" is scheduled to run until the end of February 2016. \\"Merkaba\\" opened at the Butler Art Institute with a reception attended by many local artists, media, family and friends. In an article in the Youngstown Vindicator, Guy D'Astolfo writes \\"The art in the exhibit, titled ‚ÄúMerkaba,‚Äù merges geometric shapes and patterns with scenes that can be cosmic in scope or theme. The results connect the eternal truths of science with mythology in a way that appears to be both ancient and futuristic\\". In the same article published on January 7th, 2016, Jim Pernotto states ‚ÄúThere are three words ‚Äì Pro Bono Publico ‚Äì above the doorway at the Butler Institute of American Art,‚Äù said Pernotto. ‚ÄúWe are at a place as individuals, as a city, a country and world, were we need to decide if things can only be done to maximize profit or for the good of the people.‚Äù The Butler show is scheduled to run through February 28th, 2016.

The formation of the unit started in the spring of 2014 during the 2014 pro- Russian unrest in Ukraine. The unit was initially formed as an independent force, but has been since fully integrated into the National Guard as the 2nd Special Purpose Battalion \\"Donbas\\" within the 15th Regiment of the National Guard.Ukraine civil war fears mount as volunteer units take up arms, The Guardian (15 May 2014) In October 2016 a veteran of the former volunteer battalion Anatoliy Vinohrodskyi announced about their intent to revive a volunteer battalion outside of the National Guard.

Gordon.ua. 28 January 2017 History = Prerequisites = At the beginning of March 2014, when separatist sentiments started to boil over in Donetsk, the pro-Ukrainian self- defense of the Donetsk Oblast was created by the Ukrainian patriots from Donetsk Oblast in order to protect pro-Ukrainian protests in response to the calls to create a so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and to prevent violence from the Russian special services and separatists in relation to Ukrainian citizens. The Chief of Staff of the Self-Defense Headquarter was Semen Semenchenko, and some of its participants formed the basis of the future Donbass battalion. Major-General Roman Romanov, the Head of Militsiya Department of Donetsk Oblast, handed over his powers to separatists, and Pavel Gubarev, the leader of the pro-Russian sentiments in the Donbass seized the building of the Donetsk Oblast Administration, letting supporters of the \\"Russian world\\" in. The Donbass self-defense forces asked the leadership of the Oblast and the military commissariat to create a territorial defense battalion and succeeded in this. On 15 April, a recruitment of volunteers and officers began into a new unit, which was named the Donbass Battalion. Volunteer groups, a charitable foundation of the battalion are being created, and the Ukrainians from all over the country send aid and transfer money for the unit logistics. The newly formed battalion is based in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Citizens with licensed weapons are invited to join. = Non- governmental armed formation (April 2014 ‚Äì June 2014) = In March 2014, a self-defense unit of the Donetsk Oblast was created. After the first battles, the creation of the Donbass Volunteer Battalion was announced. The commander of the squad was Semen Semenchenko, who announced a recruitment of volunteers to the unit on his Facebook page. In a few days, about 600 volunteers signed up to the Donbass battalion, and since the end of April the unit began its activities in the Donetsk Oblast. They provided assistance in moving activists who are in danger, collected information about the coordinators of pro-Russian rallies and checkpoints. The battalion leadership created groups of counteraction, intelligence, warning and escort. On 1 May, the unit participates in the first operation to capture and destroy the terrorists‚Äô checkpoints. The Donbass Battalion successfully destroyed a separatist checkpoint in Krasnoarmiysk. Three Kalashnikov guns were seized and 15 terrorists captured. The battalion commander was offered to locate a base in Novopidgorodnye at the boundary of the Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk Oblasts. After the checkpoint in Krasnoarmiysk had been destroyed, the personnel returned to the location. A few hours later, reported Russian mercenaries arrived in three buses to assault the Donbass base. The Donbass fighters were armed with several small-caliber rifles, an old rifle and several grenades. The attempt to assault the checkpoint did not succeed, as a Ukrainian military helicopter flew to help the surrounded volunteer battalion, prompting the attackers to retreat. On 11 May, a subdivision of the Donbass Battalion was stationed in Mariupol and was engaged in the protection of the city. The soldiers of the unit took part in the liberation of the military unit of the National Guard of Ukraine. On 15 May 2014, the formed unit carried out an operation to clear the territories from enemy sabotage groups. The operation was held in Velyka Novosilka, during which the DPR flag was torn down from the building of the district administration and the flag of Ukraine was put on and the control over the district was returned. Educational work was carried out with militiamen, who handed over the local militia department to terrorists. The Donbas battalion took the district under its protection, the residents of Velikonovosilkivsky district were elected to the leading positions of the district, and the branches of the Party of Regions and the Communists were forced to dissolve. On 21 May 2014, Semen Semenchenko, the battalion commander, called the part of the employees of the State Automobile Inspection of Ukraine in the Donetsk region, who defected to the DPR side as \\"traitors\\" as well as those who are carrying a joint service with the DPR soldiers at the checkpoints, accompanying vehicles‚Äô columns and guard the administrative buildings. He demanded to hand over their arms and leave the Donetsk Oblast territory within 24 hours, until noon of 22 May, threatening to eliminate them in case they continue to cooperate with the DPR. As of 21 May, the battalion took control over the administration buildings of four districts: Velikonovosilkivsky, Volodarsky, Dobropolsky and Aleksandrivsky. This was a part of the operation to ensure the security of polling stations, which allowed the presidential elections in Ukraine to be held smoothly in 2014. On 22 May 2014, Semenchenko announced the control over the Volodarske district was re-established. On 23 May, the unit performed an operation to attack fortified areas, but fell into an ambush in Karlivka. 25 fighters fought with the enemy, a company of the Vostok battalion. Five Donbas fighters were killed and the Vostok battalion lost 11. According to Semenchenko, the losses of the Donbass battalion was 4 people killed, 1 died from wounds, about 20 wounded, some were captured. = Special purpose battalion in the National Guard of Ukraine (June 2014 ‚Äì October 2016) = After the battle near Karlivka, for the leadership of the Donbass battalion it became clear that Russian mercenaries in the Donbass had already got not only small arms but heavy weapons as well. Moreover, it became obvious that the Armed Forces leadership did not provide assistance to Ukrainian volunteer detachments. The Armed Forces units, located 5 km from Karlivka, did not come to help Ukrainian volunteers. In this regard, Semen Semenchenko accepted the proposal of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov to merge the battalion into the National Guard of Ukraine. This would have offered an opportunity to arm the battalion, should have given it a legal status and provided an opportunity to coordinate its actions with the units of the Armed Forces, the NGU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Donbas Battalion training group near Kyiv (2014)On 1 June, Semen Semenchenko spoke at the People‚Äôs Veche (assembly) on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), where he first called on participants to join the unit to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. On the first day of the volunteers' recording, about 600 people arrived at Novy Petrovtsy training range, a base of Ukrainian Army Unit 3027. After this, several more volunteer enrollments were held on the Maidan. During one of these enrollments on 8, 10 June soldiers of the Presidential Regiment appeared to enter the battalion ranks. On 3 June, while a decision was being made to send volunteer battalions to the ATO, the Donbass battalion was asked to keep guard near the Verkhovna Rada as the Internal Troops were not able to offer adequate protection. The Donbass fighters faced the building of the Verkhovna Rada turning their backs to the people, demonstrating on which side they were - on the side of people. On 29 June, Semenchenko, the battalion commander spoke at the People's Veche (assembly) on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), calling for a complete change and reform of all public authorities and state institutions. A mobilization station was announced to be created on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), and many volunteers were recorded. After the Veche (assembly) the Donbass battalion volunteers went to the Presidential Administration. The battalion volunteers headed by Semen Semenchenko, their battalion commander demanded to stop a seize-fire regime with Russian mercenaries. President Poroshenko assured the future military that they would soon have an opportunity to go to the ATO area and fight. On 19 July, a decision was made to form a special purpose volunteer battalion Crimea, and on 21 July, the commander of the Donbass battalion announced the recruitment of volunteers to a new unit. It was planned to liberate Donbass from Russian mercenaries first, then involve the Crimea battalion in the liberation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea from the Russian occupation. On 4 June 2014, in the city of Izium, a meeting of the political, military and police leadership of Ukraine was held to coordinate the actions of the Donbas and Azov volunteer battalions with other military units, attended by Oleksandr Turchynov, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Arseniy Avakov, Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, representatives of law enforcement agencies, as well as commanders of both battalions. At the meeting, samples of modern armored vehicles manufactured by the Malyshev plant were shown, particularly armored combat vehicles Dozor which the Donbass were planned to be supplied to the Battalion. Semenchenko stated that having such armored vehicles he was ready to liberate Donetsk. However, for all subsequent years of the war, the Donbass battalion did not receive any such vehicle. After the military meeting in Slavyansk it was decided to send a company of the Donbass battalion to the ATO area. However, the unit was provided neither with vehicles, nor with fuel for transportation, nor with adequate equipment. At request of Semen Semenchenko, the unit commander, volunteers, entrepreneurs and ordinary Ukrainians gathered everything necessary and a company of the Donbass battalion managed to go to the frontline. 4 July 2014, an assault company of the Donbass battalion took part in a liberation operation of Mykolayivka, the Donetsk Oblast. Immediately after this operation a retreat of Russian mercenaries from Slavyansk started. The first person who provided intelligence data that the city could be enter in was Yaroslav Markevych, a volunteer of the Donbass battalion, who led a group of unmanned aerial vehicles. The battalion fighters located in Artemivsk were taking active steps to liberate the city from terrorists; night-time attacks of militants were being met, checkpoints were being built in and outside the city, as well as operations were underway to clear the territory. The battalion units provided patrols of the surrounding areas of Artemivsk and Horlivka. Only one IFV out of the promised armored vehicles was allocated for the Donbass battalion and the battalion had a KRAZ on the balance sheet armored by volunteers. Among the other \\"special equipment\\" they had two CIT vehicles, which Donbass fighters retook from Russian mercenaries in the first minutes of the battle. As a result of the operation, the volunteer battalions accused the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine of failing to provide the necessary support in heavy weapons. On 17 August 2014, together with other units, the Donbass Battalion again participated in the assault of Ilovaysk. The unit entered the city and took positions at the city school number 14 near the railway, fulfilling the task set. However, the adjacent units did not fully fulfill their obligations again. In the interim report of the Temporary Investigative Commission of the Verkhovna Rada investigating the tragic events under Ilovaysk, it says: On 19 August 2014, Semen Semenchenko, the commander of the Donbass battalion, was injured during the assault of Ilovaysk, having fragment wounds. Within 10 days, fierce battles did not stop. On 29 August 2014, leaving Ilovaysk via the Green Corridor, a Ukrainian military group fell into ambush and happened to be under the shell fire of the Russian regular army. During leaving Ilovaysk mousetrap 98 soldiers of the unit were captured. More than 100 unit fighters were injured. The official estimates were 366 military perished, 249 wounded, and 158 missing during fighting for Ilovaysk and leaving the Green Corridor. During September, October and November, the battalion personnel was withdrawn from the ATO area and engaged in a combat coordination. A part of the fighters were sent to Zolochiv city to undergo a sergeant school. In September, a large number of volunteers came to the battalion and it deployed a training camp on the polygon of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade in Cherkaske village, Dnipropetrovsk oblast, which has about 300 recruits. At the end of October, the battalion personnel together with the recruits was relocated to Kyiv oblast for training with instructors and a combat coordination. During that period, the battalion could not move to the combat area to fulfill the tasks due to the fact that about 100 soldiers of the unit were captured by Russian mercenaries during leaving Ilovaisk mousetrap. In case the battalion moved to the front line, the prisoners could have been executed. On 18 November, the first rotation of the Donbass battalion to the Peace Valley of Luhansk oblast took place. They had to watch at the local support point to assist the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The battalion was engaged in a clearing operation of sabotage reconnaissance groups of Russian army mercenaries and support of 24th separate mechanized brigade on the Bakhmut route..On 15 December the second rotation took place. From 15‚Äì25 December 2015, Donbas Battalion organized a blockade of Akhmetov humanitarian convoys to the occupied territories in order to accelerate an exchange process of captives, blocking motorways in Luhansk oblast by mobile groups in a tank-dangerous direction. Volunteer divisions like Dnipro-1, Right Sector and Aidar were involved in fulfilling separate tasks. Supplies of tobacco and vodka by Russian mercenaries were also blocked. The operation was successful: as a result of the blockade after the negotiations on 26 December, 97 soldiers from the Donbass Battalion were released from captivity of pro-Russian mercenaries, who had been captured during the operation in Ilovaysk. On 11 January 2015, the Donbass Battalion marched to Kyiv demanding an immediate sending of the unit into a combat area to carry out its functions there. A volunteer column came to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and surrounded the building. At that time, an active propaganda campaign was launched, aimed at the unit collapse. So, in January 2015, those who were expelled from the battalion for one or another misdemeanor began to accuse Semenchenko, the battalion commander, of evidence- free crimes and misdemeanors. However, the majority of the personnel didn‚Äôt believe the accusation. Nevertheless, on 13 January 2015 two companies of the battalion went to the ATO area. However, the promised armored vehicles that had been given to the battalion before start proved to be unsuitable for military tasks.At that time, the unit was performing tasks under the guidance of the Headquarters of 24th separate mechanized brigade. On 27 January, a battalion company came to the battlefield deployment from an early rotation. On 31 January, Semen Semenchenko, the battalion commander took part in the operation to unlock Svityaz battalion and was shell-shocked. On 1 February, there was an attack of Vuglegirsk. The soldiers were killed, the commander happened to be in an accident. In January‚ÄìFebruary 2015, the Donbass battalion took part in battles near Debaltseve as in an attack of fortified areas of Russian mercenaries. Anti-diversion and assault groups were operating there. During fighting for Vuglegirsk on 1 February, the unit lost four fighters. On 9 February, the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in cooperation with an anti-diversion group of the Donbass Battalion, did not allow Russian mercenaries to take control of Debaltsevo-Artemivsk route. On 12 February, the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took control of a part of Logvinovo and unlocked Artemivsk-Debaltsevo highway, the remaining resistance cells were suppressed; the Donbass battalion units carried out a clearing operation of the village and an adjacent section of the highway. In the morning of 13 February, the clearing operation of the Donbass battalion near Logvinovo was stopped. When units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine together with armored vehicles were withdrawn, militants counterattacked using armored troops ‚Äì 7 tanks; the intensity of fighting was increasing. In the battles for Logvinovo, the Donbass battalion destroyed about a platoon of enemies, a tank and an IFV, though three soldiers perished, four were injured. In general, on 13 February by midday the Donbass battalion and the Armed Forces had destroyed about 50 fighters near Logvinovo, 17 Russian mercenaries had been captured, who were later transferred to the SSU for exchange. The Donbass battalion and the Armed Forces of Ukraine held \\"a road of life\\", parallel to the field track. It was fired, but the columns were passing. At some points, the situation was complicated, and fighters had to fight half-trapped. The Donbass battalion fighters captured an enemy‚Äôs multi-purpose light-armored towered vehicle and a 122mm mortar as trophies. On 15 February, a Donbass battalion company took part in an operation to destroy fortified areas of Russian mercenaries and entered Shirokino, but it was taken to an ambush of the militants because a conductor \\"missed a turn.\\" In the course of the battle, three battalion soldiers died, three were injured, and one of them died later because of fatal wounds. During Shirokino's fighting on 15‚Äì16 February more than 100 people from the illegal armed units were killed, 10 units of armored vehicles were destroyed by the Donbas, Azov and AFU units. Late evening on 16 February, Ukrainian military managed to squeeze armed men who were not identified as militaries of the Armed Forces of Ukraine out of one of the two ruling heights near Shirokino. Little earlier, 14 Donbas Battalion fighters were able to escape from a mousetrap made not by Ukrainian militaries in Shirokino. On 18 February, near Shirokino, having occupied a residential multi-storied building before, a unit, which SSU defined as a terrorist one with some lansquenets from a neighboring state, began shelling Ukrainian positions with two mortars. Two hours later, an illegal armed group was kicked out by Ukrainian troops and began leaving in the direction of Novoazovsk. Another illegal armed group, as a result of actions of Ukrainian troops, went to the north-east - from the eastern outskirts of Shirokino under the cover of two tanks, one of the tanks disfunctioned, was evacuated by the retreating. On that day, a representative of the Ukrainian intelligence reported that Shirokino is under the fire of mortar shells and tanks of illegal armed units; in the evening of 16 February, one soldier in a Donbass battalion platoon was killed, four were wounded; at night of 17 February, a battalion column fell into an ambush, and three soldiers were killed. On 7 March, the battalion fighters detected a sabotage- reconnaissance group of the Russian Special Forces. During the battle, three mercenaries were killed and other militants were captured. In order to take them back Russian mercenaries opened a tank fire. While repulsing the attack a Donbass battalion soldier was killed. On 9 March, a Donbass battalion company supported by a tank of the 37th Battalion and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was clearing up the sea coast and knocking off the invaders from the coastal positions and occupying a dominant position that blocked an access to the battalion's rear. During the operation, 1 fighter was lightly wounded. 15 invaders were destroyed. The Azov‚Äôs tank was put into a battle, an IFV belonging to DPR was damaged by joint efforts. Another Donbass fighter was shell-shocked. On 9 April, the barracks of illegal armed units were destroyed in Shirokino by joint actions of the Azov regiment and the Donbass battalion during the fire response to the Russian mercenary attack. On 25 April, after bombardment of an ambulance near Shirokino a wounded soldier of the Donbass battalion died on the way to hospital. On 2 May, in Shirokino, since morning the fighting had been continuing, the fighters attack was defeated by the Donbass battalion fighters. Three military were wounded. During a shooting at 13:05 a shotgun from a sniper rifle wounded a Donbass battalion fighter on his head. On 3 May, during the fighting in Shirokino, another soldier from the Donbass battalion was killed. On 24 May, in Shirokino, one soldier of the Donbass battalion was killed, one wounded. Overnight into 26 May, an antitank platoon of the Donbass Battalion destroyed a KamAZ full of bullets and militants‚Äô infantry; a battalion soldier was wounded at night; in response, the enemy's fire points were suppressed. On 19 July, in Shirokino near Mariupol the Donbass battalion combatants took an IFV-2 from the Russian mercenaries during the battle. It had a torn caterpillar and beaten optics. The IFV was towed to the positions of the Ukrainian Army. During May‚ÄìJuly 2015, in Mariupol, there were rallies against so-called demilitarization of Mariupol, which would mean a total withdrawal of the military personnel from the first line of defense in Shirokine within Minsk agreements. Demilitarization did not take place, but at the end of July 2015, the Donbass battalion was withdrawn from watching Shirokino's front positions. The Donbas and Azov volunteer battalions, which kicked the invaders out of Shirokino and from February to June 2015 \\"held\\" positions, were replaced by Marine Corps of the Armed Forces. From October 2015 to March 2016, the Donbas battalion was on duty on the checkpoints of the third defense line near Mariupol and Berdyansk. From March 2016 to April 2016, a significant part of the Donbas battalion was demobilized, serving as the mobilized for a calendar year, being reluctant to continue service on the third defense line. Part of the soldiers remained in the unit hoping that the unit would still fight on the first defense line. After April 2016, the battalion was on duty on checkpoints in Mariupol zone and protected the Azov Sea coast. In early August 2016 more than 160 battalion soldiers arrived at the military training ground in the village of Stare, Kyiv oblast (3070 military unit base), for the purpose of an operational coordination. Another company of the battalion remained in Mariupol and was preparing for retirement, as the battalion was taken out of the combat area. In mid-September, from the training ground in the village of Stare, the personnel was transferred to Slovyansk, Donetsk oblast (3035 military unit base). Part of the soldiers was sent back to the military unit 3057 in Mariupol. According to an order of the NGU commander on reducing the manpower in the military unit 3057 (end of August 2016) the special-purpose battalion Donbass was destroyed. Personnel were retired due to the organizational and staffing measures on 19 September 2016. On 26 September 2016, the battalion officers were retired. = From October 2016 to present time - a non- governmental voluntary organization aimed at protection of Ukraine =  Internal Corps of the Donbass Battalion  When the majority of personnel of the NGU Donbass battalion was demobilized into the reserve in 2016, together with an honorary commander of the Donbass battalion Semen Semenchenko and the second commander of the Donbass battalion Anatoliy Vinogrodskiy, an Internal Corps of the Donbass Battalion as a public organization was formed, and later as a non-governmental volunteer organization \\" Donbass volunteer battalion\\", where the battle flag was brought [115]. The organization consists of demilitarized soldiers of the battalion who participate and conduct community- oriented activities aimed at protecting Ukrainian citizens from the unlawful acts of titushky (bullies), law enforcement agencies and fighting corruption. Starting from July 2016, the battalion Internal Corps took part in actions against illegal construction, against unauthorized felling of green spaces in Kyiv and its suburbs; was engaged in protecting businesses and agricultural businesses from raider take-overs, protecting the population from titushky (bullies), exposing criminal activities of police and cooperation between police and titushky (bullies); provided legal and media support to political prisoners, was engaged in a civil control of court sessions in cases against corruptioners and traitors, anti-maidanivtsi and raiders; blocked railroad goods traffic to occupied territories during the Blockade of Trade with Occupants; it protected a protest camp at Hrushevskyi Street during the \\"Rally for Political Reform\\". On 2 July, during Kyiv Pechersk Court attempt to arrest a chief of staff of the Aydar battalion Valentin Likholit, several hundred veterans of the War for Independence and public figures protested in Khreshchatyk. They repelled Likholit without allowing him to be imprisoned illegally. On the same day, on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), Patriots‚Äô Liberation Headquarters was proclaimed to be established. The main task was to provide legal and moral support to illegally imprisoned and repressed volunteers and patriots. At the meeting, when Patriots' Liberation Headquarters was established, three activity directions were announced: discharge from custody unlawfully or illegally imprisoned combatants; dismiss Anatoliy Matios, a military prosecutor; arrest and imprison people who contributed to Putin's aggression against Ukraine: in particular, Medvedchuk, Akhmetov, Boyko, Novinskyi, Yefremov, etc. Veterans from the Internal Corps of the Donbass Battalion are actively visiting court sessions concerning volunteer soldiers throughout Ukraine. Human rights violations According to many reports and testimonies, the soldiers of the Donbass Battalion took part in crimes and human rights abuses of the civil population of Ukraine, enjoying general impunity. A most outrageous incident happened in August‚ÄìSeptember 2014 when eight or ten members of the Donbass and Azov battalions sexually assaulted a person with mental disability. After the different forms of violence (including cruel treatment and rape), the victim's health significantly deteriorated and he was taken to psychiatric clinic. The issue raised awareness of Ukrainian Parliamentary Association \\"Forbidden to Forbid\\". At least five fighters of the battalion have been taken to court and accused of different criminal activities committed against civilian population: banditry, abduction, armed robbery, extortion, hooliganism and illegal possession of weapons. However, after a political pressure put on the judges by the former commander of the Donbas battalion, they were released. A UN monitoring mission in Ukraine reported that during the Battle of Ilovaisk, the Donbass battalion took part in ill-treatment and torture of male population of the city, aged 30 to 66. From 18 to 28 August 2014, the majority of victims were locked in school No. 14 by members of Donbas battalion. The conditions of the incarceration may amount to ill-treatment, some victims were subjected to beatings, regarding thirteen of them the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented cases of torture. All detained ones who were interviewed by the UN officers told they were beaten with intention to extract confessions that they were affiliated with rebel forces. After the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Ilovaisk, a mass grave with three bodies was exhumed in the backyard of Ilovaisk school No. 14 where the Donbas battalion had been stationed. The UN monitoring mission identified the victims as local civilians. According to the forensic reports, two of them had signs of firearm wounds on their bodies, and third had likely died as a result of shelling.

Paleontologist F. B. Loomis named Ototriton in 1919 on the basis of a single skull from the Wind River Formation in Wyoming, misinterpreting it as the skull of a salamander. Unlike salamanders and like other rhineurids, Ototriton has a shovel-shaped snout that it presumably used for burrowing underground. Ototriton is one of the earliest known rhineurids and also one of the largest. Several other species have been assigned to Ototriton since Loomis named the genus in 1919. In 1928, paleontologist Charles W. Gilmore assigned a vertebra from the Bridger Formation of Wyoming, first classified as Glyptosaurus anceps, to Ototriton based on its large size, but later attributed it to the snake Lestophis crassus. In 1945, Gilmore and G. I. Jepsen named a new species of Ototriton, O. minor, on the basis of another skull from the Wind River Formation, distinguishing it from O. solidus on the basis of its smaller size. O. minor was later classified as its own genus, Jepsibaena. The most recent study to consider the specimen places it in the species Protorhineura hatcherii.

The law authorizes there to be funding for intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency, but a separate appropriations bill would also have to pass in order for those agencies to receive any money. The law was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. A similar bill, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 (H.R. 4681; 113th Congress), was passed by the United States House of Representatives. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 - Title I: Budget and Personnel Authorizations - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2014 for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Office of the Director of National Intelligence; (2) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (3) United States Department of Defense (DOD); (4) Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (5) National Security Agency (NSA); (6) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (7) Coast Guard; (8) Departments of State, the Treasury, Energy (DOE), and Justice (DOD); (9) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (10) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); (11) National Reconnaissance Office (NRO); (12) National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and (13) United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on November 12, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 1681 would authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2014 for intelligence activities of the U.S. government. Since Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not provide estimates for classified programs, this estimate addresses only the unclassified aspects of the bill. On that limited basis, and assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, the CBO estimates that implementing the unclassified provisions of S. 1681 would cost $564 million over the 2014-2019 period. Procedural history The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 was introduced into the United States Senate on November 12, 2013 by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D, CA). The bill was referred to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It was reported alongside Senate report 113-120. On June 11, 2014, the Senate passed the bill with an amendment by voice vote. The House voted in a voice vote on June 24, 2014 to pass the bill. President Barack Obama signed it into law on July 7, 2014. Debate and discussion Senator Feinstein, who introduced the bill, spoke in favor of it, saying that \\"Congress has a responsibility to ensure the DNI and other intelligence leaders have the resources and flexibility they need to protect the nation.\\" Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) argued that the bill provides \\"clear guidance and appropriate resources to the intelligence community, while enhancing the committee's oversight of vital intelligence activities.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *United States Intelligence Community References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 1681 *beta.congress.gov S. 1681 *GovTrack.us S. 1681 *OpenCongress.org S. 1681 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 1681 *Congressional Budget Office's report on S. 1681 Category:United States federal defense and national security legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014"},{"id":"43018703","text":"The Grim Building is an office building and former medical clinic located in Kirksville, Missouri. Constructed in the Jacobethan Revival style in 1905, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in June, 1979. History Brothers Ezra and Edward Grim, both physicians, had a desire to consolidate their medical practices under one roof. In 1904 they contracted with the St. Louis, Missouri architectural firm of Weber and Groves for a building large enough to house offices, examination rooms and operating suites. Local contractor Albert L. Holmes was chosen for the construction, which was finished in October, 1905 for a final cost of $11,248. This was considered only slightly higher than a similar size building of more utilitarian design, surprising considering the ornate details often associated with a Jacobethan Revival building. The exterior is of red brick with white accent stones and trim around the windows. Great detail was given to the main entrance, a hooded limestone basket-handle arch with considerable ornamentation. An adjacent carriage house still remains from the original construction, though it has been heavily renovated over the years to provide more office and retail space. The Grims spared little expense on the interior either, with plentiful high-quality oak woodwork throughout and Tennessee marble in the main first floor hallway. Several fireplaces in the building feature ornate metal screens and green glazed tile in the immediate floor area. The Grim brothers used the eastern half of the first floor for outpatient surgery and treatment rooms until they established the Grim Brothers Hospital in 1910. A new hospital building was completed for them just south of the First District Normal School; however, Edward Grim continued to use the original building for his office until his death in 1936. The brothers' partnership went on hiatus for a time beginning in 1917 when Ezra Grim joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps, serving in France during World War I. They would continue in partnership with the hospital until their retirement while also maintaining ownership of the original building, renting out office space to other businesses. The ownership of the building remained within the extended Grim family until 1970 when a grandnephew sold it to outside investors. Plans were put forth in the 1980s to demolish the building and replace it with more parking for downtown businesses, despite the buildings' very good condition. However, public outcry, and new ownership of the building, prevented the demolition from happening. Renovation and restoration returned the Grim Building to an appearance much like it did when first constructed, save for modern lighting, heating and cooling, and some carpeted areas of individual offices. Although not a museum by intent, the interior decor of the building features many items and photos that chronicle the medical history of Kirksville, from osteopaths like Andrew Taylor Still to medical doctors such as the Grim brothers.

In most cases trilateral retinoblastoma presents itself as pineoblastoma (pineal TRb). In about a fourth of the cases the tumor develops in another intracranial region, most commonly supra- or parasellar (non-pineal TRb), but there are reported cases with non-pineal TRb in the 3rd ventricle. In most cases pineal TRb is diagnosed before the age of 5, but after the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Non-pineal TRb, however, is often diagnosed simultaneous with retinoblastoma. Prognosis of patients with trilateral retinoblastoma is dismal, only a few patients have survived more than 5 years after diagnosis; all survivors were diagnosed with small tumors in a subclinical stage. Recent advances in (high-dose) chemotherapy treatment regimens and early detection have improved survival of patients with trilateral retinoblastoma.

The coastal railway line starts as a branch line from Ernakulam Junction railway station towards Alappuzha and joins with the route via Kottayam ( Ernakulam- Kottayam-Kayamkulam line) at Kayamkulam Junction. The coastal line has a total distance of . This is the shortest route connecting major cities Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam and saves a considerable amount of time when compared to the circuitous route via Kottayam. History The initial survey for the Ernakulam‚ÄìKayamkulam line via Alappuzha was started in 1975. The initial proposed alignment of the railway line from Ernakulam Junction to Alappuzha has been changed after protests from various quarters. This line was mentioned in 1977-78 final budget. The final alignment of the route which was approved was Ernakulam‚ÄìKonthuruty‚ÄìNettor‚ÄìKumbalam‚ÄìAroor‚ÄìCherthala‚ÄìAlappuzha. The construction of railway line was started on 15 April 1979 and the construction has been divided into two reaches as Ernakulam‚ÄìAlappuzha reach and Alappuzha‚ÄìKayamkulam reach.E Sreedharan-Autobiography DC Books, 2014, pages 47-51 =Ernakulam‚ÄìAlappuzha section= The construction of this coastal railway line in Ernakulam Junction‚ÄìAlappuzha railway station section was started in 1979. Construction of Alleppey-Ernakulam new B.G. Railway line has been included in the budget for 1979-80, with a proposed outlay, of Rs. 1 crore in the coming financial year 1979-80.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2057/1/lsd_06_07_01-03-1979.pdf Page no. 26 Around 140 hectares of land was acquired for laying the railway lines. 11 new railway stations and 6 major bridges has been constructed along this route. The Aroor Bridge is the Longest Bridge in this section having length of The total cost outlay was 7 crores and the total length of the railway line is . The line was opened to railway traffic on 16 October 1989. =Alappuzha‚ÄìKayamkulam section= The construction of Alappuzha‚ÄìKayamkulam section was started as part of second phase of coastal railway development and the alignment was via Alappuzha‚ÄìPunnapra‚ÄìAmbalappuzha‚ÄìHaripad‚ÄìKayamkulam. The total length of the railway line was and the line was opened to railway traffic on 1992. Thus the Ernakulam Junction‚ÄìAlappuzha coastal railway line has been connected to Kayamkulam Junction railway station‚ÄìKollam Junction main railway line. Stations There are 18 stations along this route. Alappuzha, Cherthala, Haripad, Ambalappuzha stations are the major stations along this route.  Electrification and track doubling  Ernakulam Junction‚ÄìAlappuzha‚ÄìKayamkulam railway line is fully electrified. The double line work on Kayamkulam‚ÄìHaripad section has been completed and the double line track was commissioned in January 2012. The track doubling work for Haripad‚Äì Ambalapuzha is currently in progress. Track laying between Thakazhi and Ambalappuzha are nearly complete and works between Thakazhi and Haripad are through. Doubling of The Long Aroor Bridge has started in 2019. The doubling works for the Ambalapuzha- Ernakulam junction sector is painfully slow. There is not even a sign of any earth works or anything happening in this stretch at present. Rail traffic The Ernakulam‚ÄìAlappuzha‚ÄìKayamkulam coastal line has 20 express trains and 7 passenger trains running along this route. Superfast trains connecting the cities of Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi are increasingly preferring this route to the one via Kottayam because this route is shorter and saves considerable amount of time in reaching these cities. Major trains like Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode Jan Shatabdi Express and Thiruvananthapuram- Nizamuddin Rajdhani Express, Trivandrum-Chennai Super AC Express, kochuveli- Chandigarh Kerala Sampark Kranti, Tirunelveli-Gandhidham Humsafar Express and the Kochuveli-Mangalore Antyodaya Express run via Alappuzha. Mail /Express trains terminating at Alappuzha also use this route. At present there are no trains towards Palakkad‚ÄìPollachi line, Kollam‚ÄìSengottai branch line and Nilambur‚ÄìShoranur line passing through this coastal line.  Needed development  * A bypass line connecting Cochin Harbour Terminus railway station line with Alappuzha line near Kochu Kadavanthra and Thevara. It will help decongest Ernakulam Junction railway station and help start more south bound trains via Alappuzha. * Timely completion of doubling of line and improvement of signalling in a manner such that headway will be minimum. This will help start Kollam - Alappuzha - Kochi suburban trains. * Building a connection between Aroor Halt and Kanjiramattom on Ernakulam‚ÄìKottayam‚ÄìKayamkulam line so that a circular suburban rail network can be developed around Kochi. And decongest Ernakulam yard.

Lady Herries was the eldest of the four daughters of Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk (who was also the 13th Lord Herries of Terregles) and his wife, Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk (formerly The Hon Lavinia Strutt). Upon the death of her father in 1975 without a son, Lady Anne Fitzalan-Howard (as she then was) as the eldest daughter inherited the Herries of Terregles title, a Scottish Lordship of Parliament, and became the 14th Lady Herries of Terregles. The dukedom and the 16th duke's other titles passed to his heir male, Miles Fitzalan-Howard. From 1975 until the reform of the House of Lords in 1999, Herries was eligible to sit in the Lords but chose not to do so. Racehorse trainer Herries operated as a racehorse trainer for over thirty years from the Angmering Park estate, on the South Downs, near Arundel, Sussex. The most notable horse she trained was the Racing Post Trophy and Prix du Jockey Club winner Celtic Swing, who was crowned the champion two-year-old of 1994. She also had success in the King Edward VII Stakes, Great Voltigeur Stakes, Coronation Cup and Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud with Sheriff's Star. Amongst her other notable horses was Taufan's Melody who won the Caulfield Cup in Australia at odds of 66‚Äì1 in 1998, while she won the Wetherby Pattern Chase, Eider Chase and Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase with Set Point in the 1970s. She trained fewer winners in later years, but her 2014 record of seven flat winners had been one of her highest for several seasons. Personal life She grew up at Arundel Castle and was educated at the Priory School at Arundel and the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Woldingham (now called Woldingham School). From 1970 to 1979 she lived at Everingham in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where she was Master of Foxhounds for the Middleton Hunt, before returning to the Arundel area. She began training racehorses at Angmering in 1983. In 1985, Herries married England cricketer Colin Cowdrey, the couple remained married until Cowdrey's death in 2000.

Although the skull is incomplete, features such as a pointed, shovel-shaped snout indicate that it belongs to the family Rhineuridae. Within Rhineuridae, Macrorhineura is most closely related to Ototriton and Hyporhina, two genera from the Eocene and Oligocene of Colorado and Wyoming, based on the shared feature of equally sized dentary teeth in the lower jaw. Together they form a clade or evolutionary grouping of mid- continental rhineurids, which became isolated from a more western clade of rhineurids that includes Dyticonastis and Spathorhynchus. Rhineurids were relatively common across much of North America during the Paleogene, but their range contracted in the Neogene as the climate became colder, leaving only one living species in Florida, Rhineura floridana. The presence of Macrorhineura in the Miocene shows that mid-continental rhineurids persisted into the Neogene, although by this time their distribution range was already shrinking.

The series features an ensemble cast that includes Justin Theroux, Amy Brenneman, Christopher Eccleston, Liv Tyler, Chris Zylka, Margaret Qualley, Carrie Coon, Ann Dowd, Kevin Carroll and Jovan Adepo. The series takes place in a variety of locations, including New York (seasons 1‚Äì2), Texas (seasons 2‚Äì3) and Victoria, Australia (season 3). It begins three years after the \\"Sudden Departure\\", a global event that resulted in 2% of the world's population disappearing, and follows the lives of those who were left behind. Series overview Episodes =Season 1 (2014)= The first season consists of ten episodes and aired from June 29 to September 7, 2014. It takes place primarily in the small town of Mapleton, New York, three years after the \\"Sudden Departure\\" ‚Äì an event which saw 2% of the world's population (approximately 140 million people) disappear and profoundly affected the townspeople. The characters of police chief Kevin Garvey and his family (wife Laurie, son Tom, daughter Jill and father Kevin Sr.) are focal points of the season, alongside grieving widow Nora Durst, her brother Reverend Matt Jamison, and the mysterious cult-like organization the Guilty Remnant (GR), led by Patti Levin. The first season follows multiple storylines, notably the fallout from the Departure and the subsequent grief, anger and fear the townspeople share with the rest of the world. The season also focuses on Kevin's failing attempts to maintain order in the town and to keep his family together, the GR's increasingly nefarious schemes and the townspeople's sentiment against them, Matt's crisis of faith, and Nora's attempts to move on and conceal the pain she has been harboring since the Departure. The first episode has no opening credits, while the opening theme for the other nine episodes is \\"The Leftovers (Main Title Theme)\\" by series composer Max Richter. =Season 2 (2015)= The second season consists of ten episodes and aired from October 10 to December 6, 2015. It takes place a year after the first season, centering around the fourth anniversary of the Departure.

The town has become a tourist site and a popular destination, leading Kevin, Nora, Matt and other characters from the first season to move to Miracle. New characters introduced include town staples the Murphy family: father John, mother Erika, daughter Evie and son Michael. The second season follows multiple storylines, notably the ideological battle between those who believe Miracle is special and those who do not, Kevin and Nora's relationship being tested by Kevin's increasingly erratic mental state, the Murphy family's search for their missing daughter, and Matt's attempts to prove the existence of a miracle only he witnessed. The opening theme for all ten episodes is \\"Let the Mystery Be\\" by Iris DeMent. =Season 3 (2017)= The third and final season consists of eight episodes and aired from April 16 to June 4, 2017.

Thomas Benson (1708‚Äì1772), of Knapp House, (alias Nap) Appledore,Taylor, p.3 on the north Devon coast, England, was a ship-owner and merchant who was Sheriff of Devon in 1746-7 and MP for Barnstaple between 1747 and 1754.Matthews, Shirley, BENSON, Thomas (1708-72). History of Parliament Online. In 1753 he fled to Portugal from British justice, having been accused of customs duty evasion and maritime insurance fraud. Biography He was the second son of John Benson (died 1739) of Knapp by his wife Grace Melhuish. The Bensons were long established merchants at Bideford, with an established trade to France, Portugal and Placentia in Newfoundland. They also owned lime-kilns in Bideford, near Appledore. In 1737 Benson married his cousin Frances Melhuish (died 1752), a daughter of Roger Melhuish by his second wife Eleanor Barber. By Frances he had two sons and two daughters. On his father's death in 1739 Benson inherited some of his ships and some property in Appledore together with ¬£1,000. This was augmented when he became heir to his elder brother Peter, who died in 1743. In his will Peter tried to dissuade his brother Thomas from continuing in the family trade, as he considered the future economic climate to be unfavourable. In 1745 Benson presented a silver punch bowl, inscribed with his armorials, to Barnstaple mayor and corporation.Baring Gould, p.234 He was elected to Parliament as the member for Barnstaple in 1747, and the following year he acquired a lease of the Island of Lundy, off the North Devon coast, for a rent of ¬£60 per annum from John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower.Taylor, p.7 Some time before 1753, Benson also purchased the estate of Halsbury in the parish of Parkham, near Bideford, from Roger Giffard (died 1763).Risdon, Tristram (died 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.414 In 1747 he obtained a contract from the Government to transport convicts, and gave the usual bond to the Sheriff to ship them to Virginia or to Maryland. However he shipped them instead to Lundy where he employed them as slave labourers in building walls, etc. His defence was that sending convicts to Lundy was the same as sending them to America, saying \\"they were transported from England, no matter where it was so long as they were out of the kingdom\\". His interpretation of the law was upheld. =Illegal activities= Despite the advice his brother left in his will, Benson continued to trade and expanded his operations into illegal activities including avoidance of paying customs duties on his imports, a large part of which were of tobacco from the American colonies, a trade in which Bideford was pre-eminent. He stored his smuggled goods in a cave on Lundy, which were discovered and the Sheriff of Devon was directed to levy the penalties on Benson. In 1752 he failed to pay some ¬£8,000 of duty on imports valued at ¬£40,000 and was prosecuted in the Court of Exchequer for non- payment. His estates, including Nap, were sequestered by the Crown.Baring Gould, pp.234‚Äì5 In 1752 he obtained insurance at Exeter for his ship Nightingale which was fully laden with a valuable cargo of pewter, linen and salt, supposedly sailing for Maryland in America. However he gave orders to his captain and relative by marriage, John Lancey, to secretly unload the goods onto Lundy, and to scuttle the vessel. On 3 August 1752 the captain put the plan into action and scuttled the vessel in the Bristol Channel. The plot was discovered by the authorities following a confession by a crew member and Lancey was convicted, and hanged at Execution Dock in London on 7 June 1754.Baring Gould, pp.235 The episode is the subject of crime novel Hell and High Water by Tanya Landman. Benson fled to Portugal in 1753,Taylor, p.16 and his English assets and lands were seized by the Crown. Halsbury was later sold to the Davie family of nearby Orleigh.Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, p.415 In Portugal he was joined by two of his remaining ships, and with his nephew Thomas Stafford he established one of the largest English trading companies in that country.Taylor, p.18 He is said to have died in Oporto in 1771 at the age of 64, but no direct evidence of this has been found.

Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day. As of July 2017, the memorial plaque remained under development. Background Aerial view of National World War II Memorial The National World War II Memorial is a national memorial opened in 2004National World War II Memorial that is dedicated to Americans who served in the armed forces and as civilians during World War II. Consisting of 56 pillars and a pair of small triumphal arches surrounding a plaza and fountain, it is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on the former site of the Rainbow Pool at the eastern end of the Reflecting Pool, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Text of Act The act reads as follows: SEC. 2. PLACEMENT OF PLAQUE OR INSCRIPTION AT WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL The Secretary of the Interior-- (1) shall install in the area of the World War II Memorial in the District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day; (2) shall design, procure, prepare, and install the plaque or inscription referred to in paragraph (1); and (3) may not use Federal funds to prepare or install the plaque or inscription referred to in paragraph (1), but may accept and expend private contributions for this purpose. SEC. 3. COMMEMORATIVE WORKS ACT. Chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (commonly known as the \\"Commemorative Works Act,\\" shall apply to the design and placement of the plaque within the area of the World War II Memorial. Procedural history A similar version of this bill, , was introduced into the United States House of Representatives and previous versions of the bill passed in earlier Congresses, but never became law. The World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States Senate on May 23, 2013 by Sen. Rob Portman (R, OH). The bill was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on National Parks. The bill passed in the Senate on June 5, 2014 by unanimous consent. The House voted in Roll Call Vote 339 on June 23, 2014 to pass the bill 370-12. On June 30, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. Debate and discussion The bill was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Hindu American Foundation, and the Interfaith Alliance. Together the organizations argued that the bill \\"endorses the false notion that all veterans will be honored by a war memorial that includes a prayer proponents characterize as reflecting our country's 'Judeo- Christian heritage and values.'\\" The organizations argued that \\"the memorial, as it currently stands, appropriately honors those who served and encompasses the entirety of the war\\" and was carefully created, so no additional elements, such as FDR's prayer, need to be added. According to the organizations, \\"the effect of this bill, however, is to co-opt religion for political purposes, which harms the beliefs of everyone.\\" Simon Brown, of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that \\"American veterans - like those currently in the armed forces - come from many different religious traditions and some follow no spiritual path at all. Slapping a prayer onto a memorial that honors all those veterans would be an insult to both their service and their sacrifice.\\" Senator Portman, who introduced the bill, argued that Roosevelt's \\"word brought strength and comfort to many during one of the most challenging times for our nation... We should not underestimate the power of prayer through difficult times.\\" The bill was also supported by the Christian Coalition of America.

Life He was the son of a border guard. At the age of eight, his family moved to Hannoversch M√ºnden, which would be his home for the remainder of his life, despite many years spent elsewhere. His parents lacked the money to provide him with formal artistic training, so he obtained instruction wherever possible, especially from the local goldsmith.HNA Regiowiki: Biography of Eberlein In 1866, thanks to the patronage of a pastor who had recognized his talents, he was able to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Nuremberg. In 1869, he went to Berlin on a scholarship. Three years later, another scholarship enabled him to study in Rome.Biography @ Gustav Eberelein Forschung e.V. Upon his return to Berlin, he received significant support from Martin Gropius. Despite growing success, the next decade was difficult. His three-year-old son died in 1882, then his mother in 1888. This was followed by a divorce in 1891. A year later, he married the Countess Maria von Hertzberg, an aspiring young artist, and was appointed a Professor at the Prussian Academy of Arts the year after that. In 1900, he came out in strong opposition to the \\"Lex Heinze\\" (which, among other things, banned the display of \\"immoral\\" art works). That same year, all but a few of his figures were removed from display at the Great Berlin Exhibition, not only because of the law but also, probably, because of his support for French and Belgian sculptors (such as Rodin and Meunier). In fact, as tensions between Germany and its western neighbors grew, Eberlein's outspoken advocacy of peace and disarmament caused him to lose his public commissions. =Later career= Tomb at Alter St.-Matth√§us-Kirchhof He was able to find work elsewhere, notably in South America, but his finances never recovered and he was divorced for a second time in 1912. The following year, he auctioned off most of his possessions in anticipation of emigrating, but those plans were put off because of World War I. He received some orders during the war and created a small museum at his studios in Berlin but, after the war, criticism was renewed; especially for his creating a statue of Karl Marx at the same time he was doing one of the former Kaiser. He was especially well known for his small figures and portrait sculpture and produced over 900 works. The majority of his larger bronze monuments were melted down during World War II. Most of his 300 original plaster models were disposed of by the city of M√ºnden after his death. In 1962, work related to a construction project revealed approximately 80 figures and 11 paintings that were preserved and restored between 1983 and 1989. Many are now in the collection of the Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin. He was able to avert destitution only by adopting his housemaid as his daughter, ensuring that he would be cared for by her family. By the time of his death, he was nearly forgotten. He was buried at the Alter St.-Matth√§us-Kirchhof in Berlin.
