The castle had a 100 ft (33 m) high tower and was built between 1432 and 1446 by Sir John Fastolf, who (along with Sir John Oldcastle) was an inspiration for William Shakespeare's Falstaff. The castle suffered severe damage in 1469 when it was besieged and captured by the Duke of Norfolk. The castle, other than the tower, fell into ruin after 1600 when a new house was built nearby. The castle's tower is still intact and can be climbed by visitors, although as of July 2020 the tower is temporarily closed due to the need for social distancing. Paston Letters A plan of the castle from J. D. Mackenzie's The Castles of England: their story and structureMackenzie, J. D., 1897, The Castles of England: their story and structure. Macmillan. p. 348. Mural monument of William Crow (d.1688), owner of the Castle from 1659. Holy Trinity Church, Caister-on-Sea Sir John Fastolf intended that the castle should be converted into an enormous chantry, to pray for his soul and that of his nearest and dearest; but as a result of various disputes about his will, it devolved instead to the Paston family, while the bulk of Fastolf's money went to endow Magdalen College in Oxford. Consequently, the castle features extensively in the 'Paston Letters', a unique collection of family correspondence covering the period of the Wars of the Roses, documenting the Paston family's struggles to climb and maintain position on the English social ladder. John Paston was a close confidante and advisor to Sir John Fastolf. Sir John died childless, and intestate; the castle was one of many properties in his estate. John Paston, with some justification, claimed to be his heir; this put him in direct conflict with various major players of the time, such as the Duke of Norfolk and Sir William Yelverton. As a result the castle was besieged in August 1469 by the Duke ‚Äì in pursuit of his own claim of ownership ‚Äì and defended by John Paston junior and approximately 30 men. The two-month defence was unsuccessful, resulting in the death of one of the Paston's longest-serving servants by a crossbow wound, and the loss of the castle to the Duke. Some years later, the castle was ultimately returned to the Paston family's ownership. In 1659 the Pastons sold it to William Crow (d.1688), an upholsterer and money lender of the City of London, whose inscribed mural monument survives in Holy Trinity Church, Caister-on-Sea, although the fine marble sculpted bust of Crowe was stolen from it in 2014.Great Yarmouth Mercury newspaper 9 May 2014 Later the Castle descended by marriage to the Bedingfield family. The Castle later suffered from neglect and the robbing of stonework and other fittings, including in about 1776 when Rev. David Collyer removed a newell staircase with 122 stone steps from the tower and incorporated in into his house at Wroxham.https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1287573 The inner moat was filled in between 1842 and 1893 and a lake was created by the widening of the south-eastern side.

In North America, it was published by Midway Games and retitled Space Invaders Deluxe. The sequel to Space Invaders (1978), the player controls a laser base that must destroy formations of descending aliens, while avoiding their projectiles. New features have been added, such as aliens that split into two when shot and short cutscenes in-between stages. It runs on the Taito 8080 arcade system. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. The player (bottom) is exchanging shots with a formation of aliens. Space Invaders Part II is a fixed shooter with mechanics similar to its predecessor. The player controls a laser base that must eliminate all of the aliens that march down from the top of the screen, who plot to take over Earth. Aliens slowly move towards the edge of the screen and then move downward, increasing in speed as more aliens are killed. The player can protect their laser base from incoming projectiles by hiding underneath large shields, which become damaged when inflicted by projectiles fired by either the player or aliens. A UFO will occasionally appear at the top of the screen, which can be shot down for bonus points. Alongside the core Space Invaders gameplay, Part II introduces several new elements. Some aliens will split into two smaller ones when they are shot. A new type of UFO may sometimes appear that flashes as it moves towards the side of the screen, which can only be shot down when it becomes visible. In later stages, UFOs have the ability to deploy additional aliens when few remain. Completing each stage will also award the player with a short cutscene, showing the aliens causing mischief with each other. Stages are indicated by the number displayed on the shields. Development Space Invaders Part II was released in Japan by Taito in November 1979, and in North America by Midway Games in January 1980. It was designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, the creator of the original Space Invaders, and was made to clear out inventory of excess Space Invaders arcade boards. The North American release was titled Space Invaders Deluxe, however the title screen still uses the Part II name, likely due to Taito's contract with Midway that only allowed them to make minor modifications to the game. Reception Cash Box magazine liked the game's colorful graphics and additional gameplay mechanics, saying that it would \\"add to the enjoyment of the most avid and skilled players.\\" New Computer Express magazine was lukewarm towards Prize Space Invaders for its high price point, although stated that its prize mechanic made this somewhat forgivable. In a 1998 retrospective review, Allgame found Part II to be \\"barely a sequel\\" for it having very little differences from the original game, although liked its challenge and blocky graphics. Allgame also criticized it for becoming boring and tedious after prolonged play. Space Invaders creator Tomohiro Nishikado prefers it over the original, citing its variety in gameplay. Legacy A Game Boy version of the game was released in 1990, which featured support for the Game Link Cable to enable multiplayer. A harder, redemption version of the game, Prize Space Invaders, was released the same year, awarding money based on how well the player did. Part II is included in the compilations Space Invaders Virtual Collection (1995), Space Invaders Anniversary (2004), Taito Memories Gekan (2005), Taito Legends (2005), Taito Legends Power-Up (2007), and Space Invaders Pocket (2007). It was ported to mobile phones in 2007 as part of Space Invaders Trilogy, bundled with the original Space Invaders and Return of the Invaders. It is also set to appear in the upcoming Nintendo Switch compilation Space Invaders Invincible Collection.

Established in the 11th century as a motte-and-bailey design within an Anglo-Saxon burgh, it grew to become what historian Nicholas Brooks has described as \\"one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries\\".Brooks, p.17. Held for the Empress Matilda during the civil war years of the Anarchy, it survived multiple sieges and was never taken. Over the next two centuries it became a luxurious castle, used by royalty and their immediate family. After being abandoned as a royal residence by Henry VIII, the castle fell into decline. Refortified during the English Civil War, it was eventually slighted, i.e. deliberately destroyed, after being captured by Parliamentary forces after a long siege. The site was subsequently left relatively undeveloped, and the limited remains of the castle walls and the considerable earthworks are now open to the public. History =11th century= As an important regional town, overlooking a key crossing point on the River Thames, prosperous and with its own mint, the town of Wallingford had been defended by an Anglo-Saxon burgh, or town wall, prior to the Norman invasion of 1066.Durham, Hassal, Rowley and Simpson (1972), p.82; The Borough of Wallingford: Introduction and Castle, A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 (1923), pp. 517‚Äì531, accessed 26 April 2011. Wigod of Wallingford, who controlled the town, supported William the Conqueror's invasion and entertained the king when he arrived in Wallingford.The Borough of Wallingford: Introduction and Castle, A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 (1923), pp. 517‚Äì531, accessed 26 April 2011. Immediately after the end of the initial invasion, the king set about establishing control over the Thames Valley through constructing three key castles, the royal castles of Windsor and Wallingford, and the baronial castle, later transferred to royal hands, built at Oxford.Emery, p.15. Wallingford Castle was probably built by Robert D'Oyly between 1067 and 1071. Robert had married Wigod's daughter Ealdgyth, and ultimately inherited many of his father-in-law's lands. The wooden castle was built in the north-east corner of the town, taking advantage of the old Anglo-Saxon ramparts, with the motte close to the river overlooking the ford, and required substantial demolition work to make room for the new motte-and-bailey structure.Armitage, p.437; Pounds, p.207. Unusually, it appears that the castle was constructed on top of high-status Anglo-Saxon housing, probably belonging to former housecarls.Creighton, p.140. The motte today is 60 metres (197 feet) across and 13 metres (43 feet) high. Robert endowed a sixteen-strong college of priests within the castle, which he named St Nicholas College.Pounds, p.235. =12th century= A 1912 plan of Wallingford Castle: A ‚Äì Wallingford bridge and ford; B ‚Äì River Thames; C ‚Äì city defences; D ‚Äì bailey; E ‚Äì motte Wallingford Castle passed from Robert to first his son-in-law Miles Crispin, and then Brien FitzCount, who married Robert's daughter after Miles died. Brien, an important supporter of Henry I, was the son of the Duke of Brittany, and probably strengthened the castle in stone in the 1130s.Keats-Rohan, p.315; Bradbury, p.82. He produced a very powerful fortification, including a shell keep and a curtain wall around the bailey, that, combined with the extensive earthworks, has been described by historian Nicholas Brooks as \\"one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries\\".Keats-Rohan, p.315; Bradbury, p.82; Brooks, p.17; 'Wallingford Castle, the Gatehouse website, accessed 3 July 2011. After the death of Henry, however, the political situation in England became less stable, with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne. Brien had originally been considered a supporter of Stephen, but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her, joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south-west. Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress's faction ‚Äì it was either the closest base to London, or the first in line to be attacked by Stephen's forces, depending on one's perspective.Bradbury, pp.82‚Äì3. Stephen attacked the castle in 1139, initially intending to besiege it, as the walls were considered impregnable to assault.Bradbury, p.83; Slade, p.34. Brien had brought in considerable supplies ‚Äì contemporaries believed the castle could survive a siege for several years if need be ‚Äì and Stephen changed his mind, putting up two counter-castles to contain Wallingford along the road to Bristol, before continuing west.Bradbury, p.83; Hosler, p.43. The next year, Miles of Gloucester, possibly acting under orders from Robert of Gloucester, struck east, destroying one of the counter-castles outside Wallingford.Bradbury, p.90. The civil war between Stephen and Matilda rapidly descended into an attritional campaign, in which castles like Wallingford played a critical role in efforts by both sides to secure the Thames Valley.Bradbury, p.133. After the fall of Oxford to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, and the importance of the castle continued to grow. Around this time Brien established a notorious prison within the castle, called Cloere Brien, or \\"Brien's Close\\", as part of his efforts to extract money and resources from the surrounding region. The nobleman William Martel, Stephen's royal steward, was one of the most high-profile prisoners to be kept there.Slade, p.40. Contemporary chroniclers reported the cries of tortured prisoners in the castle disturbed the inhabitants of the town of Wallingford. There was not enough space in the castle for all of Brien's forces, and various houses in the town had to be taken for the use of his knights.Slade, p.39. St Nicholas College, Wallingford Castle Between 1145 and 1146 Stephen made another attempt to seize Wallingford, but was again unable to take the castle despite building a powerful counter-castle to the east, opposite Wallingford at Crowmarsh Gifford, and building castles to the west at Brightwell, South Moreton and Cholsey.The Borough of Wallingford: Introduction and Castle, A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 (1923), pp. 517‚Äì531, accessed 26 April 2011; Spurrell, pp.269‚Äì270. He returned with larger forces in 1152, reestablishing the counter-castle at Crowmarsh Gifford and building another one overlooking Wallingford bridge, and settled his forces down to starve the castle out.Bradbury, p.182; Hosler, p.43. Brien, supported by Miles' son, Roger of Hereford, who had also become trapped in the castle, attempted to break through the blockade, but without success.Bradbury, p.182. By 1153, the castle garrison was running very low on food, and Roger made a deal with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself.Bradbury, p.183. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately bring an end to the civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153.Bradbury, p.184. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153. At the end of the 12th century, the castle become closely associated with King John, who had been granted the town by Richard I in 1189. John seized the castle as well during his revolt in 1191, and although he was forced to return it, he reclaimed it when he became king himself in 1199. John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it. =13th‚Äì15th centuries= The castle moat Under Henry III, Richard, the 1st Earl of Cornwall was formally granted the castle as his main residence in 1231. Richard lived in considerable style, and spent substantial sums on the property, building a new hall and more luxurious fittings. Richard's election as King of the Romans in 1251 brought an end to his use of the property, but the castle became embroiled in the Second Barons' War in the 1260s. Simon de Montfort seized the castle after his victory at the battle of Lewes, using it to imprison the royal family for a time, before moving them to the more secure Kenilworth Castle. Reclaimed by Henry III at the end of the conflict, it continued to be used by the Earls of Cornwall as a luxurious home for the rest of the century. Edward II gave Wallingford Castle first to his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, and then to his young wife, Isabella of France, with large sums still being spent on the property. Edward continued to use the castle as a royal prison for holding his enemies, until his own fall from power in 1326; Isabella, who overthrew her husband, then used it as an early headquarters following her invasion of England. Her son, Edward III, ultimately settled the castle on the new title of the Duke of Cornwall, used by sons of the king. The castle continued to be used as a county jail, with many complaints about the number of felons who were able to escape from it. The cost of maintaining the castle from local rents and revenues became more challenging towards the end of the 14th century, with additional royal revenues being required for the ongoing work required on it. Nonetheless, in 1399 when Richard II was deposed, the castle was well fortified and in good condition, forming what historian Douglas Biggs calls \\"a formidable obstacle\\" to Richard's enemies, and able to host the royal government when it first fled from London.Biggs, p.130. Wallingford Castle played little role in the Wars of the Roses and after Henry VIII used it for a final time in 1518 it appears to have fallen into disuse as a royal residence. =16th‚Äì19th centuries= One of the few pieces of castle wall to survive the slighting in 1652 The castle fell into decline in the 16th century; it was separated from the Duchy of Cornwall, and under Queen Mary the site was stripped for lead and other building materials for use at Windsor Castle. The antiquarian John Leland described the castle in 1540 as being \\"nowe sore yn ruine, and for the most part defaced\\", although the jail continued in use throughout the period, albeit still suffering from many escapee inmates. Held by various nobles from 1600 onwards, it returned to the crown under Charles I, who gave it to Queen Henrietta Maria, but by then the castle was only really valuable for the surrounding meadow land and fisheries. The English Civil War broke out between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament in the 1640s; with the king and Parliament maintaining their capitals in Oxford and London respectively, the Thames Valley once again became a critical war zone. Wallingford was a Royalist town, with a garrison established there in 1642 to prevent an advance on Oxford to the north-west.Newman, p.31. Colonel Thomas Blagge was appointed governor, and in 1643 the king instructed him to refortify the castle, inspecting the results later that year. By 1644, the surrounding Thames towns of Abingdon and Reading had fallen and Parliamentary forces unsuccessfully attacked the town and castle of Wallingford in 1645. General Thomas Fairfax placed Wallingford Castle under siege the next year; after 16 weeks, during which Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces, the castle finally surrendered in July 1646 under generous terms for the defenders. The risk of civil conflict continued, however, and Parliament decided that it was necessary to slight, or damage so as to put beyond military use, the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur.Lysons, p.397. The castle was virtually razed to the ground in the operation, although a brick building continued to be used as a prison into the 18th century.Lysons, p.397; The Borough of Wallingford: Introduction and Castle, A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 (1923), pp. 517‚Äì531, accessed 26 April 2011. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.Rowley and Breakell, p.158. Today The mansion, abandoned due to rising costs, was demolished in 1972, allowing Wallingford Castle to be declared a scheduled monument as well as a Grade I listed building.Wallingford Castle, the Gatehouse website, accessed 26 April 2011; Rowley and Breakell, p.159. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming to better understand the historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.Wallingford Burh to Borough Research Project, University of Leicester, accessed 3 July 2011; The Big Dig: Wallingford, Archaeology, Oliver Creighton, Neil Christie, Matt Edgeworth and Helena Hamerow, accessed 3 July 2011.

The exact originator of towel animals is unknown, but their popularity is often attributed to Carnival Cruise Lines. The ancestors of the towel animals are perhaps handkerchief animals or napkin folds. Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Disney Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Disney Hotels and Holland America Line cruises will often place towel animals on a patron's bed as part of their nightly turndown service.

It is regarded by some as The First World Cup. It is predated by the Torneo Internazionale Stampa Sportiva, which was hosted in 1908 in Turin. Also seen as an international competition, but with the noted lack of an England team, Lipton in partnership with the Italian royal family, wanted to go one further and make a more complete tournament. Of course the actual World Cup features international teams from around the world, but the Lipton Cup, an invitational, only featured a few club sides from Europe. Italy, Germany and Switzerland sent their most prestigious club sides to the competition, but The Football Association of England refused to be associated with it and declined the offer to send a team. Not wishing to have England unrepresented in the competition, Lipton invited West Auckland FC, an amateur side from County Durham and mostly made up of coal miners, to take part. Some verbal tradition in West Auckland was that the FA intended to send Woolwich Arsenal but West Auckland were invited instead as they shared the same initials. West Auckland won the tournament and returned to Italy in 1911 to defend their title. In this second competition, West Auckland beat the then amateur team Juventus 6-1 in the final, and were awarded the trophy outright. The development of football on other continents: Asia, Africa and the Americas was not very advanced and Europe was where the major football was happening. In January 1994 the original trophy, which was being held in West Auckland Working Men's Club, was stolen and to date has not been recovered.

Borislav Kostic was born in Vr≈°ac, Kingdom of Hungary, then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father Dimitrije was a merchant and his mother was Emilija (n√©e: Mandukiƒá). He learned the game around the age of ten and made rapid progress while studying Oriental Trade in Budapest. He also spent time in Vienna, the chess capital of the day, and this enabled him to get the high level practice necessary to take his game to the next level. In 1910 he moved to Cologne and from there, travelled and toured extensively, mainly in the Americas, playing matches against local champions and exhibiting his legendary skills as a player of simultaneous blindfold chess. At New York in 1916, he once played twenty opponents without sight of a board and won nineteen games and drew one, while engaging in polite conversation with opponents and spectators. Kostic played more formal matches against Frank Marshall, Jackson Showalter, and Paul Leonhardt, and won them all. At Havana in 1919 however, this impressive winning streak came to an abrupt end with a 5‚Äì0 loss to Capablanca. Capablanca wrote that his own career peaked with this match. Kostic also played tournaments while in the United States, including New York 1916, Chicago 1918 and New York 1918, where he finished second behind Capablanca. A monument to Bora Kostic in Vr≈°acOn the European circuit, he won at Stockholm 1913, finished second at Hastings 1919 and won at Hastings 1921/1922. At Trencianske Teplice 1928, he won ahead of Steiner, S√§misch and Spielmann. At Bled 1931, he finished in tenth place, but nevertheless outscored such luminaries as Mar√≥czy, Colle and Pirc - the tournament was, at the time, regarded as one of the strongest in history. At Bucharest 1932, he won the title of Romanian champion. At Belgrade 1935, he shared the title of Yugoslav champion with Pirc, and went on to become sole champion in 1938. He was a clear winner at Ljubljana the same year. From 1923‚Äì26, Kostic travelled all over the world, including Australasia, the Far East, Africa, India, and Siberia, demonstrating his exceptional skills, generating interest in chess and forging new links with people across the globe. He was undoubtedly a brilliant publicist and ambassador for the game, although this probably prevented him from realizing his full potential as a player. An interesting chess match was held in Africa at the equator. Bora Kostic was on the northern hemisphere, and his opponent on the south. In the late 1920s, he made a return trip to the Americas. He represented Yugoslavia in four Chess Olympiads (London 1927, Prague 1931, Warsaw 1935, and Stockholm 1937), and in the 3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad at Munich 1936. During World War II, Kostiƒá was imprisoned in a concentration camp by a Nazi SS commander (Schiller) because he declined to participate in tournaments called \\"Free Europa\\" and to glorify the Nazi regime. Afterwards, he played chess only in a more minor capacity. His final appearance was at the Z√ºrich veterans tournament of 1962, which he won. Kostic was awarded the Grandmaster title by FIDE in 1950, on its inaugural list. He was fluent in several foreign languages: Russian, English, Hungarian, German, Spanish and Hebrew. He died in Belgrade in 1963, aged 76.

During nearly 200 years and four generations the family counted 14 fiddle makers, many of them among the most important in the fiddle- maker tradition in Norway. It may well be the largest fiddle maker family in history. From B√∏ in Telemark to Notodden, Skien and Wisconsin Olav Gunnarson Helland settled in Notodden, Telemark, Norway in 1896 and established a Hardanger fiddle workshop. His fiddles are considered among the finest within the tradition. Knut Gunnarsson Helland and Gunnar Gunnarsson Helland emigrated to US in 1901 and settled in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin where they became well known ski jumpers. They opened a fiddle workshop, \\"Helland Brothers\\" together. Knut died in 1920 and his brother Gunnar continued the business until 1927. John Gunnarson Helland settled in Skien, Telemark, Norway and ran a workshop and a music shop until his death in 1977. The other fiddle makers continued their work in B√∏ until the last, Knut Knutsson Steintj√∏nndalen died in 1969.

In May 2020, the Sunday Times estimated his net worth at ¬£978 million Early life Urs Schwarzenbach was born in Thalwil in 1948, and raised in K√ºsnacht. He is the son of a print shop owner. Career Culham Court, 2007 Schwarzenbach set up Interexchange, the largest foreign exchange dealership in Switzerland. Through its success, he has bought well over ¬£300m of property in the UK, in Australia, a palace in Morocco, ¬£17m of assets in the aviation field and the Grand Hotel Dolder in Z√ºrich. He also has his own polo team, the Black Bears, which has some 600 horses, with 350 in Australia and 250 in the UK. He personally backed the racing-themed restaurant Caf√© Grand Prix in Mayfair, London, but this went into liquidation in 2004. In 2005, Schwarzenbach was estimated to be worth around ¬£900m but, according to The Sunday Times Rich List 2012, he was ranked 87th with an estimated worth of circa ¬£850m. In 2007, Schwarzenbach outbid other foreign buyers to acquire Culham Court, a riverside estate downstream of Henley-on-Thames on the Berkshire bank. Schwarzenbach bought the estate from Paddy and Annabel Nicoll for ¬£35 million. Mrs Nicoll's father is Sir Martyn Arbib, former head of the Perpetual fund management company, who bought the estate as a wedding present for her in 1997 for ¬£12 million. Coincidentally, Culham's connections with the world of finance run deeper still; Arbib acquired the property from Felicity Behrens, wife of the banker Michael Behrens, who lived there for nearly half a century from 1949 to 1996. Schwarzenbach's development of the Culham Court estate still continues apace with the ongoing extension of the existing deer park with over 4 kilometres of wrought iron deer fencing, a mile long \\"London\\" drive through beautiful beech woodland to the main road, the 2010 ¬£8 million acquisition of three cottages and the original walled gardens which will be reinstated to provide fresh fruit and vegetables for the main house, a new ha- ha, and an extensive state of the art 24/7 security system including a \\"hard\\" room. The latest creation is a maze requiring the planting of 20,000 mature yew bushes, and this is just part of the 20-year plan that has been devised for the gardens and grounds. Another property acquired for ¬£2m in 2010, and situated on raised ground that overlooks Culham Court, has been demolished and Culham Chapel was built in its place. Symm, the Oxford-based building company undertaking all the work on the Culham estate, now sponsors the Hambleden Horse Trials. In 2008, it was reported in the press that Schwarzenbach had bought nearby Fawley Court for ¬£22 million. Another substantial riverside property on the outskirts of Henley-on-Thames and once owned in the nineteenth century by a Scottish banker, it was sold in controversial circumstances by the Congregation of Marian Fathers, a Polish religious community which had no further use for it. During 2012, extensive building works continue on the main house yet again with Symms continuing to be the main beneficiary of the contract and work at the two lodges adjacent to the A4130 at the main entrance to the \\"London drive\\" are being completed after well over a year and some interesting underground developments. In 2012 the Schwarzenbachs revoked their consent for the permissive footpath that had run alongside the Thames in front of Culham Court as part of The Thames Path for many years. Schwarzenbach has invested a large sum of money to underground the vast amount of the high and low voltage overhead electricity network with the boundaries of Culham estate. VAT fraud and art trafficking with Galerie Gmurzynska In 2013/14, Schwarzenbach was investigated by the FCA (Federal Customs Administration) for alleged VAT fraud totalling some ten million Swiss francs and art trafficking. Under Swiss law, owners of artworks do not have to pay import charges until works of art are formally brought into the country, i.e. they come out of storage and are officially transferred. On Tuesday 16 April 2013, Schwarzenbach's Hotel Dolder in Zurich, which had been displaying a lavish art collection, was raided by Swiss customs officials. This action was simultaneous with a raid on nearby Galerie Gmurzynska on the suspicion of supplying the five-star Hotel Dolder with imported artworks valuing 75M Swiss Francs without paying duty. The Swiss authorities seized a large number of documents during their raid. Gmurzynska filed a complaint to prevent their inspection, but the Federal Court has ruled that in a criminal investigation of this kind where there is reasonable suspicion, the prosecuting FCA can demand to see papers it considers relevant to the case. The case has been covered in several international outlets including 'Die Welt'. In October 2016 the Swiss Customs Directorate finalised a compelling case that Schwarzenbach in effect had legally exported artefacts for a value of at least 130 million CHF and smuggled them back into Switzerland.Article \\"Saftige Busse f√ºr Dolder- Besitzer: Kunstschmuggel nachgewiesen\\", Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung (NZZ), 24 October 2016, page 17. Schwarzenbach eventually admitted the charge and also accepted to pay the VAT amounting to ten million CHF. However, by October 2016 he was still objecting to pay the fine of 4 million Swiss francs.Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, 24 October 2016. Dolder Grand Hotel The Dolder Grand Hotel, Zurich He owns the Dolder Grand, a 5-star Zurich hotel, which cost him SFr 440 million. Australian property Schwarzenbach owns about 50,000 hectares of farmland in New South Wales, Australia, through his Romani Pastoral Company. Most of this is between Harden and Jugiong, and includes the polo estate Garangula, as well as Redbank, a house once owned by the impresario Robert Stigwood. Morocco He bought part of Palais Layadi, a 19th-century palace set in a 4,000 square meter compound in Marrakech, since at least 2008.The main parts of Palais Layadi (Palais Soleiman) which include the reception area still belong to the moroccan Segueni's family. Philanthropy Schwarzenbach has supported the internal and external refurbishment of the Venerable English College in Rome, as well as its engagement of a research fellow and project archivist. Personal life Schwarzenbach lives at Culham Court near Henley- on-Thames and sponsored the rowing gallery of the River and Rowing Museum in Henley which is named after him. He owns other estates and farms in England, a 10,000 acre sporting estate in Scotland and the largest country estate on the Isle of Wight. His wife, Francesca Schwarzenbach-Mulhall, is a former Miss Australia, born in Sydney, and is a godmother of Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter of the Earl of Wessex. The couple have two children. Their daughter Sascha is married to Irish Olympian Clifton Hugh Lancelot de Verdon Wrottesley, 6th Baron Wrottesley. They live in St Moritz, Switzerland and London, England, and have four children.

A SnorriCam presents a dynamic point of view from the actor's perspective, providing an unusual sense of vertigo for the viewer. History The SnorriCam is named after two Icelandic photographers and directors, Einar Snorri and Ei√∞ur Snorri, who worked together under the name Snorri Bros (but are not otherwise related).Snorri Bros: Bio - What We Do The concept of the SnorriCam has been around for decades. Various ad hoc versions of the device were implemented in films going as far back as the Nazi-banned \\"Kuhle Wampe\\" in 1932 and Seconds, in 1966. However, the practicality of such a point-of-view device was limited by the weight of the camera. Since most 35mm motion picture cameras were simply too heavy to carry easily, there was no real point in developing such a device. However, with the emergence of the Steadicam and the manufacture of small, lightweight cameras that could fit on the Steadicam platform, an added bonus of these newer, lighter cameras was the possibility of a point-of-view device such as the SnorriCam. Uses in film SnorriCam sequences have been used in cinema.IMDb keyword search: \\"snorricam\\" In Mean Streets, a SnorriCam shot follows the lead character (played by Harvey Keitel) as he moves through a crowded bar and passes out drunk in the back. In Truck Turner, the character played by Yaphet Kotto can be seen in his final throes of death through the eyes of a SnorriCam. Armageddon uses a virtual SnorriCam to depict an astronaut being hit by a burst of gas and flying off into space. In 28 Weeks Later, a zombie is filmed through a SnorriCam while chasing Robert Carlyle's character. In The Hangover, the character Stuart played by actor Ed Helms, has a SnorriCam attached as he wakes up disoriented and hungover. The bollywood movie Dev D uses SnorriCam sequence to depict point of view of the lead character in a drunken state where nothing makes sense in the background. The films œÄ and Requiem for a Dream, both directed by Darren Aronofsky, use the SnorriCam extensively. Uses in television The \\"Sir Digby Chicken-Caesar\\" sketches in That Mitchell and Webb Look use a SnorriCam extensively. In Torchwood, the episode \\"Dead Man Walking\\" (Season 2 Episode 7) also has a sequence where the character Owen Harper is seen moving through a nightclub in a SnorriCam sequence with a slight speed up. The first episode of the second series of Skins features a SnorriCam being used in a party scene. The British television show Misfits also uses a SnorriCam during a party scene with several of the characters. The show Scrubs uses SnorriCam shots in a few episodes to show nervousness. In the Discovery Channel show Survivorman, Les Stroud will often employ this technique when walking, due to the limitations of not having a film crew. The technique has also been used in episodes of the hit television series Lost. Season 1 of Dexter also features a SnorriCam shot at the start of episode 11 used on the main character, Dexter Morgan. Episode 10 (\\"Imperfect Harmony\\") of Selfies sole season used a SnorriCam to highlight a major character's experience at a party. The technique is also featured in the seventh series of \\"Supernatural\\". Last episode of first series of \\"Shameless\\" features Snorricam being used in the opening scene. The shots in \\"Scrubs\\", \\"Dexter\\", \\"Lost\\" and \\"Shameless\\" were all accomplished using the Bodymount from Doggicam Systems. Uses in music videos One of the first uses of a SnorriCam in music videos was in The Smashing Pumpkins video \\"1979\\" directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris in 1995. Other notable uses of the SnorriCam are in Spike Jonze's 1998 \\"Home\\" video for Sean Lennon, Janet Jackson's \\"Go Deep\\" in 1998, Tricky's 1995 video for \\"Hell Is Round the Corner\\", the Marcos Siega-directed System of a Down video for \\"Chop Suey!\\" (2001), Mick Jagger's \\"God Gave Me Everything\\" (2001) video by Mark Romanek, Siobh√°n Donaghy's \\"Overrated\\" (2003) video by Big TV!, the award-winning video for Adam Freeland's \\"We Want Your Soul\\" (2003), Samuel Bayer's Green Day \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" (2005) video, David Mould's video for Placebo's \\"Meds\\" (2006), James Blunt's \\"Same Mistake\\" (2007) directed by Jonas √Ökerlund and Tove Lo's \\"Habits\\" (2013) video directed by Motellet. Adam Buxton/Garth Jennings's video to Radiohead's \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\" (2008) uses head cams in order to achieve the same effect that the SnorriCam provides. Branden Bratuhin and Marcus Matyas' video for Danielle Duval, \\"Imposter\\" (2011) utilized a compact digital camera to record her singing her song across various locations in Toronto. The music video for \\"All We Know\\" by The Chainsmokers and Phoebe Ryan also features SnorriCam footage from both front and back of the actor. The snorricam is also used extensively in the music video for ‚ÄúSmooth Sailing‚Äù by Queens of the Stone Age. The video features the SnorriCam being used both behind the actors head as well as in front of their face.

The novellas are Dunyazadiad, Perseid and Bellerophoniad, whose titles refer eponymously to the mythical characters Dunyazad, Perseus and Bellerophon (slayer of the mythical Chimera). The book is an example of postmodernism, which can be seen in its metafictional content and its incorporation of stylistic elements that go beyond the traditional novel genre. It shared the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction with Augustus by John Edward Williams. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1973\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-30. (With acceptance speech by Barth and two essays by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog. The essay nominally about Williams and Augustus includes Augenbraum's discussion of the split award.) Plots =Dunyazadiad= The Dunyazadiad is a retelling of the framing story of Scheherazade, the famed storyteller of the One Thousand and One Nights. The story is told from the point of view of Scheherazade's younger sister Dunyazade. Its characterization as metafiction can be understood as a result of the use of several literary devices, most notably the introduction of the author as a character and his interaction with Scheherazade and Dunyazade. The author appears from the future and expresses his admiration for Scheherazade and the 1001 Nights as a work of fiction, of which Barth's Scheherazade has no knowledge. Realizing that he has appeared to Scheherazade on the eve of her first encounter with Shahryar, and seeing her without a solution to her predicament, the author himself suggests the stratagem of using a chain of interrupted stories to forestall her execution, and offers to tell her a new story every day with which to regale the king the following evening. Taking the author for a genie, Scheherazade agrees. =Perseid= The second novella entitled Perseid follows the middle aged Greek hero Perseus in his struggle to obtain immortality. Told from Perseus' point of view, the first part of the story revolves around the retelling of Perseus' life history while the following part details his rise to, and eventual immortalization as a constellation of stars. =Bellerophoniad= The final novella, Bellerophoniad, chronicles the story of Bellerophon, yet another ancient Greek hero. While somewhat rooted in the myth as told by the Greek and Roman poets, Barth's version of the story is not a direct retelling, but instead a re- imagining. Much like the Perseid, the Bellerophoniad surrounds a middle aged mythic hero who struggles with coming to terms with his past accomplishments and a desire to secure his future glory. It is, for the most part, told from the point of view of Bellerophon, with various interjections by unknown narrators, one of which is presumed to be the author Barth. Of the three novellas, it is by far the longest and--more so than in Dunyazadiad and Perseid--makes numerous references to the other novellas, further connecting common themes and events between the three. Central characters ;Dunyazadiad Scheherazade: Also referred to as \\"Sherry,\\" she is the key storyteller from One Thousand and One Nights and much of this novella's plot revolves around her and her power of crafting stories. She is nevertheless not the principal narrator of the Dunyazadiad. Dunyazad: Also referred to as \\"Doony,\\" Dunyazad is the sister of Scheherazade and being held captive by the King. Doony narrates the first and longest of the three chapters in the novella. Shahryar and Shah Zaman: The King and his brother. Both men were cuckolded by their wives, so together they devise a revenge plan whereby they each deflower and then kill a new woman from their kingdom each night, initializing the conflict of the story. The Genie: Actually a writer - likely a representation of Barth - who magically transports through time and space from 20th century America to Sherry and Doony's room. Scheherazade is his favorite author/narrator and he falls intellectually in love with her. With the help of the Genie, Sherry and Doony devise the plan to tell the King stories every night to forestall sex and execution. This plan involves the Genie reading a section of One Thousand and One Nights every day and then reporting back to Sherry, complicating notions of authorship. ;Perseid Perseus: The hero of Greek mythology who beheaded the Gorgon Medusa. He narrates his own life story to Calyxa with the aid of elaborate temple murals, paying particular attention to his life after most of his great deeds are over. In the novella, he suffers through a midlife crisis and struggles to understand his relevance now that he is no longer a heroic young man. He repeatedly struggles with impotence through his story. Andromeda: Perseus's wife who's grown dissatisfied with marriage and Perseus's obsession with his past triumphs. Calyxa: A nymph and priestess charged with the task of caring for certain gods' and heroes' temples, including Perseus's. A very devoted individual, Calyxa appears obsessed with Perseus's stories and craves his sexual attention, despite his impotence. Medusa: Beheading Medusa had been Perseus's major heroic accomplishment, but now the figure troubles Perseus because of his lost glory and issues of guilt. ;Bellerophoniad Bellerophon: The Greek mythic hero who first tamed Pegasus and slayed the Chimera, becoming the King of Lycia. Also called \\"Bell,\\" he's Perseus's younger cousin and he constantly compares himself self-consciously to the older hero. The Narrator: Somewhat a version of Bellerophon, he was \\"transformed by the seer Polyeidus into a version of Bellerophon's life\\" in order to tell this story (138). He constantly questions his own adequacy for the task, and his narrative doubts perpetually intrude in the story. Philonoe: Bellerophon's wife. She loves Bellerophon and is comfortable in her life, but she sees every delight in life as a \\"net loss\\" (148) Melanippe: An Amazonian woman that Bellerophon has as a \\"lover and alleged chronicler\\" in the second half of his life (146). Intrudes on narration periodically. Polyeidus: He tutors Bellerophon and his twin, Deliades, when they were children, and he is the marsh seer who turns Bellerophon into the narrator of the \\"Bellerophoniad.\\" Polyeidus has trouble controlling his magical abilities and prophesying. Intrudes on narration periodically. Style and structure Chimera is written in three loosely related sections, or novellas, similar to the way the mythical Chimera is a hybrid creature composed of three animals (typically some combination of a lion, a goat, and a snake). There are a number of Q&A; sessions and diagrams, all occurring in Bellerophoniad: a classification of human actions (175), a genealogical chart of demigods (182), a geometric \\"schema\\" for the course of dramatic action (251), and a cyclic depiction of the heroic journey (261).

Founded by William O'Brien MP, it generated a new national movement to achieve agreement between the different parties concerned on the historically difficult aim of Home Rule for the whole of Ireland. The AFIL established itself as a separate non-sectarian party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, binding a group of independent nationalists MPs to pursue a broader concept of Irish nationalism, a consensus of political brotherhood and reconciliation among all Irishmen, primarily to win Unionist consent to an All-Ireland parliamentary settlement. Members of Parliament, in the \\"Cork Free Press\\" 30 July 1910. These are: Patrick Guiney (North Cork), James Gilhooly (West Cork), Maurice Healy (North-east Cork), D. D. Sheehan (Mid Cork) and Eugene Crean (South-east Cork). The other MPs elected in January 1910 were: William O'Brien (Cork city), John O'Donnell (South Mayo) and Timothy Michael Healy (North Louth). Elected in December 1910 was John P. Walsh (South Cork). Maurice and Timothy Healy were brothers. Conciliation plus business O'Brien's conciliatory initiation of the 1902 Land Conference, achieved with the backing of the United Irish League (UIL) which he had founded, led to agreement on the Wyndham's Land Purchase Act of 1903, which resolved Ireland's century old land question. This was followed by the housing of agricultural labourers, settled under the 1906 Labourers (Ireland) Act. With Irish local government already well established, O'Brien was convinced that to achieve the final hurdle of All-Ireland self-government, the success of the approach he used to win the Land Act, the \\"doctrine of conciliation\\" combined with \\"conference plus business\\", must also be applied to alleviate the fears and integrate the interests of the Protestant and Unionist community in their resistance to Irish Home Rule since 1886. The issue was a source of contention amongst a significant majority of Unionists (largely but not exclusively based in Ulster), who opposed Home Rule, fearing that a Catholic Nationalist (\\"Rome Rule\\") Parliament in Dublin would discriminate or retaliate against them, impose Roman Catholic doctrine, and impose tariffs on industry. While most of Ireland was primarily agricultural, six of the counties in Ulster were the location of heavy industry and would be affected by any tariff barriers imposed. Following the success with the Land Purchase Act, the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) was long disrupted by internal dissensions after it had alienated William O'Brien from the party in November 1903. He was condemned by party leader John Dillon for allegedly making former tenant farmers less dependent on the party and for the manner in which he secured a new political base in Munster through his alliance with D. D. Sheehan and the Irish Land and Labour Association.Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, Ch.2 'Elites' pp.70‚Äì71, Gill & Macmillan (1999) In addition, forging further alliances with T. M. Healy and unionist devolutionists during 1904‚Äì05 in his engagement with the Irish Reform Association Maume, Patrick: pp.69‚Äì73 and ensuing support for the Irish Council Bill. By 1907 the country called for reunion of the split party ranks and in November O'Brien's proposals for his and other Independent‚Äôs return to the Party were accepted. Their return to the Nationalist fold in mid-January 1908 O‚ÄôDay, Alan: Irish Home Rule 1862‚Äì1921 p.224, Manchester University Press (1998) was however to be short lived, as conflict ensued from the government‚Äôs intention to amend the Land Act of 1903. Hibernian clash O'Brien had always been gravely disturbed by the Irish Parliamentary Party's involvement with \\"that sinister sectarian secret society\\", the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) also known as the Molly Maguires, or the Mollies ‚Äì what he called \\"the most damnable fact in the history of this country\\", and was bitterly resentful and unsparing in his attacks upon it.MacDonagh, Michael: The Life of William O'Brien, the Irish Nationalist, pp.181‚Äì2, Ernst Benn London (1928) AOH members represented Catholic-nationalism of a Ribbon tradition, their Ulster Protestant counterpart the Orange Order. The AOH Grandmaster was a young Belfast man of remarkable political ability, Joseph Devlin MP, who attached himself to the Dillonite section of the Irish Party, as well as being General Secretary of its adopted United Irish League (UIL).MacDonagh, Michael pp.181‚Äì2 Devlin was already known as \\"the real Chief Secretary of Ireland\\",MacDonagh, Michael: p.182 his AOH spreading successfully and eventually saturating the entire island.Garvin, Tom: The Evolution of Irish Nationalist Politics : pp. 105‚Äì110 The Rise of the Hibernians Gill & Macmillan (2005) Even in Dublin the AOH could draw large crowds and stage impressive demonstrations. In 1907, Devlin was able to assure John Redmond, the Irish Party leader, that a planned meeting of the UIL would be well attended because he would be able to get more than 400 AOH delegates to fill the hall. William O'Brien addressing the \\"Baton Convention\\" with Dillon, Redmond and Devlin looking on indifferently. Baton Convention As prelude to O'Brien's formation of the AFIL, Redmond called a National Convention at the Mansion House, Dublin, 9 February 1909,Jackson, Alvin: Ireland 1798‚Äì1998 p.448, Blackwell Publishing (1999) to win support for a House of Commons bill introducing compulsory land purchase while curtailing funding of tenant land purchase under the Birrell Land Act (1909). Over 3000 UIL delegates attended. Redmond, who chaired the meeting, claimed it would burden the British Treasury and local ratepayers excessively. O'Brien argued that the curtailing Bill would kill land purchase by provoking refusal by landlords to sell and worsen relations between tenants and landlords. The convention was obviously loaded against O'Brien when delegates suspected of supporting him were excluded at the entrance and assaulted in \\"probably the stormiest meeting ever held by constitutional nationalists\\".Jackson, Alvin: Home Rule: An Irish History 1800‚Äî2000 p.112, Phoenix Press (2003) When he attempted to speak O‚ÄôBrien was howled down by various contingents of Belfast Hibernians and midland cattle-drivers, their presence pre-organised by Devlin's AOH organisation. Its stewards, armed with batons, attacked O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs follower who had gained entrance, their general order to \\"Let no one with a \\"Cork accent\\" get near the platform\\". From which the event earned the name Baton Convention.MacDonagh, Michael: p.183 When Eugene Crean MP for Cork SE was attacked on the platform, it developed into a m√™l√©e with Devlin and his lodgemen, after D. D. Sheehan and James Gilhooly, MP for north Cork, intervened against Crean's assailants,Sheehan, D. D., Ireland since Parnell, pp.214‚Äì15, Daniel O'Connor, London (1921) this in Redmond's presence. Others targeted were members of the Young Ireland Branch, Frank Cruise-O'Brien and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, who called Devlin a brainless bludgeoner.Maume, Patrick: p.99 League launched Regarding himself as having been driven from the party by Hibernian hooligans, O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs subsequent move was to officially constitute his new movement, the \\"All-for-Ireland League\\", its embryonic origins ‚Äì the successful Land Conference of 1902, which he launched at a public rally in KanturkSheehan, D. D.: p.218 in March 1909. It was immediately openly denounced by Redmond, and at an Irish party meeting held on 23 March, the party voted fifty to one that membership in the League was incompatible with party membership.Maume, Patrick: p.100 O'Brien suffered a health breakdown in April, and retired from politics to Italy to recuperate. Control of the fledgling AFIL passed to a Provisional Committee led by D. D. Sheehan (MP) as Honorary Secretary, its foremost task to promote the League's principles and to hold O'Brien's seat in Cork at the inevitable by-election until his return. Announcement of the League's Inaugural Meeting 31 March 1910 From Italy O'Brien looked to an alliance with Arthur Griffith's moderate Sinn F√©in movement through emissaries James Brady (a Dublin solicitor), John Shawe-Taylor and Tim Healy. O'Brien offered funds for Sinn F√©in candidates to run in Dublin and funds to run its paper Sinn F√©in, in return for Sinn F√©in support of his candidates in the south. A special Sinn Fe√≠n executive council meeting called 20 December 1909 seriously considered these overtures, many present in favour of co-operation. Sinn F√©in's William Sears reported the end result: \\"Regret cannot cooperate because the Constitution will not allow us. Mr. Griffith was in favour of cooperation if possible\\".O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: William O‚ÄôBrien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, The All-for-Ireland League p.193, University of California Press (1976) Nevertheless, in the following years O‚ÄôBrien and his party continued to associate itself with Griffith's movement both in and out of Parliament. In June 1918, Griffith asked O‚ÄôBrien to have the writ moved for his candidacy in the East Cavan by-election (moved by AFIL MP Eugene Crean) when Griffith was elected with a sizeable majority.Maume, Patrick: p.207 (note 322) O‚ÄôBrien returned from Italy for the January 1910 elections, which was marked by considerable turbulences in the county Cork constituencies.O'Donovan, John: Nationalist political conflict in Cork, 1910 in ‚ÄòJournal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society 2012‚Äô Vol. 117, pp.37‚Äì39, Cuman Staire agus Seand√°la√≠ochta Chorca√≠, ISSN 0010-8731 His electoral success must have exceeded his expectations. Eleven Nationalists independent of the official party returned, seven of them his League's followers who won all their contests. It rejuvenated his project of the All- for-Ireland League,O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: p.194 as well as a new newspaper The Cork Accent, alluding to events at the Baton Convention. He next framed the League‚Äôs programme containing several unique points: ::1) extension of the conciliatory spirit of the Land Conference to the larger problem of Irish self-government; ::2) distrust of the Irish Party‚Äôs alliance with the Liberals and specific opposition to Lloyd George's budget and Birrel's revision of the land settlement; and ::3) hostility to the Ancient Order of Hibernians.Miller, David W.: Church, State and Nation in Ireland 1898‚Äì1921 p.256, Gill & Macmillan (1973) The League held its inaugural public meeting on 31 March 1910 in the City Hall, Cork. Its rules and constitution were formulated and endorsed at a public meeting on 12 April,Cork Accent, 13 April 1910 where it announced its Home Rule manifesto and political policies to be: ::*\\"the union and active co-operation in every department of our national life of all Irish men and women of all classes and creeds who believe in the principles of domestic self-government for Ireland.'' ::*For the accomplishment of this object the surest means were to be a combination of all the elements of the Irish population in a spirit of mutual tolerance and patriotic goodwill, such as shall guarantee to the Protestant minority of our fellow-countrymen inviolable security for their rights and liberties, and win the friendship of the people of Great Britain without distinction of party.\\" MacDonagh, Michael: p.185 \\"Three C s\\" Banner T.D.S.

Towns often had rival AFIL and AOH bands, occasionally clashing on Sunday parades. Decisive election Throughout the summer and autumn of 1910 the growth in strength of the AFIL continued in areas previously dominated by the UIL, which gave rise to considerable conflict. It was accompanied by repeatedly violent IPP-UIL hostilities towards O'Brien and his lieutenants wherever they endeavoured to spread his gospel of Conciliation. AFIL supporters retaliated with equally aggressive street fighting, at times RIC police forces being called upon in several towns to disperse rioting crowds.O'Donovan, John: pp.37‚Äì52 A renewed election was called on by the Prime Minister Asquith on 28 November due to a parliamentary stalemate at Westminster. In the up-and-coming election O'Brien's task was truly formidable. It was a case of AFIL versus UIL, his candidates earmarked for rejection not alone by the Irish Party‚Äôs Hibernians. There was considerable adversity to O‚ÄôBrien and his followers amongst many Catholic churchmen, who long regarded him as at heart an unreconstructed Parnellite, and latently anti-clerical.Callanan, Frank: T. M. Healy, p.465, Cork University Press, (1996) () The Church‚Äôs forces were mobilised even more thoroughly against him when Cardinal Michael Logue expressed himself against O'Brien's and his League, and disapproved of 'Conciliationism'. All three County Cork bishops opposed O'Brien. Distribution of party seats in the December 1910 election O'Brien's antagonism towards the AOH was counter-productive in mobilising the Catholic clergy, with one or two exceptions, behind the official IPP-UIL candidates. O'Brien felt as if he were under siege from clerical forces and wrote despondently \\"We have to deal with a confederacy of the priests of this country to strangle the AFIL and to strike down its standard-bearers\\".Miller, David W.: pp.256‚Äì66 The competition between the rival nationalist parties in Cork was, at times, extremely violent. In the general and council election contests of 1910 and 1914 in the city, a total of 11 people were shot and two killed in clashes between IPP-UIL and AFIL supporters. Many more injured in street brawls between the rival partiesHart, Peter: The IRA and its Enemies p.47 Supreme in Cork Attempts to carry the contest into Irish Party territory failed; a meeting at Crossmolina, County Mayo ended almost fatally when revolver shots were fired and O'Brien's audience routed by toughs and priests.O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.201 In the December 1910 general elections, the League, dependent almost entirely upon O'Brien's personal following amongst the rural community in Munster (the bulwark of Sheehan's Land and Labour Association) and though woefully lacking in clerical support, returned eight AFIL MPs (three further Nationalist Independents were also returned). In the end it was Cork, the country's largest county, which vindicated O'Brien's policies returning the eight seats to form his new political party. It included Timothy Healy who the previous November created the unusual AFIL coalescence of Healyism and O'Brienism. Healy lost his seat in Louth north, but was returned in a 1911 by-election after Moreton Frewen retired his seat in Cork north-east.O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.201/2 The Cork Free Press gave the total Redmondite vote in the country as 92,709, and the Independent Nationalist's vote, largely supporting the principles of the League, as 39,729 (30.46%) which included the constituencies outside of Cork contested by fourteen AFIL candidates (Armagh south, Dublin Harbour, Kerry south and east, Limerick city, Limerick west and east, Louth north, Mayo west, Tipperary mid, Waterford west and Wexford south).Walker, Brian M. (ed): Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801‚Äì1922, Royal Irish Academy, Dublin (1978) Striking proposals The AFIL party was convinced that the success of an Irish Parliament must depend upon it being won with the consent rather than by the compulsion of the Protestant minority. In a 1911 letter to the Prime Minister H.H. Asquith, the party specifically proposed Dominion Home Rule as the wisest of all solutions to the Irish question.Sheehan, D. D.: Ireland since Parnell, Ch. XX p.243, Daniel O'Connor London (1921) After the introduction of a new Third Home Rule Bill by Asquith in April 1912, an AFIL conference held in Cork on 25 May declared whole- hearted support of the Bill, subject to three amendments: ::* firstly: safeguards providing against the apprehensions (however imaginary) of Ulster; ::* secondly: the completion of the abolition of landlordism by the use of Imperial credit; ::* thirdly: the empowering of the Irish Parliament to raise, as well as to spend, its revenue.MacDonagh, Michael: p.187 During the House of Commons second reading and debate of the third Government of Ireland Bill on 13 June 1912, an amendment had been moved to exclude the counties Antrim, Armagh, Down and Londonderry from the provisions of Home Rule, Sir Edward Carson, leader of the Ulster Unionists, called on Redmond to \\"listen to the Cork members\\",Commons debate Government of Ireland Bill 13 June 1912, Carson section #1078 when he said: > There has been an attempt, and I admit it fully and frankly, by some few > Irish members, led, I believe by the hon.

In January 1914 both O'Brien in his Cork Free Press and D. D. Sheehan in the London Daily Express simultaneously published a list of concessions they ascertained as acceptable to Ulster, enabling its participation in a Dublin parliament. The proposals in brief were: ::1. That the representatives of Ulster should have an exercisable veto right over Irish legislation; ::2. Ulster should have sixty representatives in the Irish House of Commons, out of a total of 164; ::3. All representatives of the Irish Civil Service should be by competitive examination; ::4.

Otherwise Ireland once divided would remain divided and 'the line on which you are presently travelling will never bring you anything except division and disaster'. When the Bill finally passed the Commons on 25 May, O'Brien's speech was the only protest by an Irish representative.O'Brien, William: The Responsibility for Partition, Ch. II: A final Protest before History, p.29, Maunsel & Roberts Dublin & London (1921) In the course of his speech O‚ÄôBrien said (in extract): > \\"The game was lost for Ireland the day the honourable member for Waterford > (Mr. Redmond) and his friends consented to the Partition of Ireland. > Bitterly opposing any genuine concession to Ulster at the right time, now > consenting to the concession of all which will not only fail to conciliate > Ulster, but will rouse millions of the Irish race in revolt against your > Bill. . . . . .

Calamities unfold August saw the sudden beginning and the involvement of Ireland in World War I . The Government of Ireland Act 1914 receive the Royal Assent in September, but was suspended for the duration of the war. O'Brien and his party rallied in support of the Allied cause in support of Britain's war effort, as did the IPP and its National Volunteers in unison with most sections of Irish society. O'Brien perceived it as an opportunity for all Irishmen, Protestant and Catholic alike to unite and serve together in the long-term interest of attaining independent Irish self-government. The initial recruiting response to enlisting in Irish regiments of the 10th and 16th (Irish) Division was considerable. Ulstermen enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. By 1915 with stalemate on the Western Front and the losses of the 10th (Irish) Division in the Dardanelles at Cape Helles, enthusiasm began to wane. O'Brien had warned a decade earlier of the resurgence of revolutionary nationalism evolving out of the sectarian basis of national action, subsequently erupting in the 1916 Rebellion. This was to have serious ramifications for Ireland's subsequent history. Despite his trenchant views up to 1914, on 13 June 1916 the AFIL's main opponent Joe Devlin chaired an AOH Convention in Dublin that approved the proposed partition of Ireland by 475 votes to 265.Wm O.Brien, The Irish Revolution (1923) Chapter XVII \\"The final surrender of the six counties O'Brien suffered closure of his newspaper, the Cork Free Press in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be careful about what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in Frongoch internment camp.Martin, Peter: Censorship in the two Irelands 1922‚Äì39, Introduction p.9, Irish Academic Press (2008) Convention boycott Following the Easter Rising the Government's attempt in July 1916 to have Redmond and Carson agree on immediately introducing Home Rule, failed. The new Prime Minister Lloyd George proposed in May 1917, in what was a fifth attempt to implement Home Rule, that an Irish Convention, composed of representative Irishmen from all parties, should assemble to deliberate upon the best means of governing their country. The AFIL Party was asked to nominate representatives to the Convention. In reply O'Brien stated four essential conditions which first needed to be fulfilled if the Convention was to succeed. He submitted a panel to the Cabinet limited to twelve leading representatives of the main bodies and parties involved. It was subsequently clear that such a prominent representation would not have separated without coming to agreement, but O'Brien's proposals were set aside. None of those he proposed were invited. Instead the ninety-five who agreed to attend in July were composed of nine-tenths representatives drawn from already elected representatives who had previously voted for the Home Rule partition settlement. Lloyd George appealed to O'Brien to attend, but under the circumstances both he and Healy declined, despite the fact that for thirteen years he had been calling for a conference of all parties to settle the Irish question. O'Brien believed that the conclave would make \\"a hateful bargain for the partition of the country under a plausible disguise\\". What was needed instead was not a \\"heterogeneous assembly ... but a small round-table of representative Irishmen\\". As early as 18 May Sinn F√©in declined to send representatives, the Dublin Trades Council, the Cork Trade and Labour Council, the Gaelic and National Leagues also refused.O'Day, Alan: Irish Home Rule 1862‚Äì1921, Attempts to implement Home Rule, 1914‚Äì18, pp 280‚Äì87, Manchester University Press (1998) The only constructive contribution which the Ulster delegates made to the Irish Convention was to propose in March 1918, the partition of Ireland with the exclusion of all of the province of Ulster.Hennessey, Thomas: Dividing Ireland, World War I and Partition, The Irish Convention and Conscription p. 213, Routledge Press (1998) Handing over Kanturk Union Hall 1909 plaque commemorating the founding of the AFIL A final contest between the old parliamentary rivals ensued on the death of AFIL party chairman James Gilhooly in October 1916. The West-Cork by-election has a place in history as the first after the Rising and the last in which the Irish Party narrowly captured a seat and as the self-induced demise of the AFIL. At stake in the bitterly fought by-election was not just one of the 105 seats in the House of Commons, the great issue was William O'Brien's AFIL versus John Redmond's Irish Party. In November three candidates were nominated, the third also a local AFIL supporter who stood in protest after O'Brien passed him over in favour of Frank Healy, a Sinn F√©in close candidate who had been imprisoned in Frongoch, thereby splitting the AFIL vote to the detriment of O'Brien's party.Southern Star Centenary Edition ‚Äì 1889‚Äì1989 A bitter by-election in 1916: West Cork pivotal point in transition to new era article pp.89‚Äì90 by George D. Kelleher, Inniscarra, co. Cork (At that time seats were won by \\"candidates first past the post\\", or uncontested as in 1918 by S√©an Hayes of Sinn F√©in). Ireland's Anti-Conscription Pledge, 1918 When Britain moved to introduce Home Rule in April 1918 as proposed by the Irish Convention, it unwisely did so when it linked its implementation with a conscription bill for Ireland after the collapse of the Allied, and Irish, divisions during the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front. This resulted in the ‚ÄùIrish conscription crisis\\". At its height the AFIL withdrew from Westminster while making a final damning anti-conscription speech, joining forces with the Irish Party, Sinn F√©in and Labour in mass protest demonstrations in Dublin. Although the act was never put into force its crisis caused an unprecedented rise in popularity for Sinn F√©in, destroying all interest in Home Rule and constitutional nationalism. Towards the end of 1918, as a consequence that both the Irish Party and Britain failed to introduce Home Rule and maintain an undivided Ireland, and as it became evident that constitutional political concepts for attaining independent All-Ireland self- government were being displaced by a path of militant physical-force, the AFIL MPs recognised the futility of contesting the December general election‚ÄîO'Brien in an address to the election: > We cannot subscribe to a programme of armed resistance in the field, or even > of permanent withdrawal from Westminster; but to the spirit of Sinn F√©in, as > distinct from its abstract programme, the great mass of independent single- > minded Irishmen have been won over, and accordingly they ought now to have a > full and sympathetic trial for enforcing the Irish nation's right of self- > determination.MacDonagh, Michael: p.234 The party members issued a manifesto supporting the moderate Sinn F√©in movement, and unanimously decided to retire from the election MacDonagh, Michael: p.237 and in D. D. Sheehan's composed document: A tribute of remembrance to William O‚ÄôBrien, February 1928. putting its seats at the disposal of its candidates, all of whom were returned unopposed as Sinn F√©in representatives. Conclusion The dual policy of the League aimed at attaining All-Ireland self-government, initially as Home Rule within the United Kingdom, then as a Dominion. It maintained that there could neither be any form of coercion of Unionist Ulster nor any question of partitioning Ireland. Instead it proposed achieving this by cultivating rapprochement between moderate Catholic and Protestant Irishmen through conference and conciliation as opposed to conflict. It also demanded guarantees for unlimited safeguards to protect the minority Protestant community. Its primal aspiration was to have the people on this island come to realise that it is possible for Irish of different persuasions to live together in mutual toleration. It failed in these aims because most Nationalists underestimated the intensity of Unionist resistance to Home RuleCollins, M.E., Sovereignty and partition, 1912‚Äì1949 p.28, Edco Publishing (2004) quote: \\"Like most nationalist, Redmond knew little about Ulster unionists. He under-estimated the intensity of their resistance to Home Rule and the strength of the UVF.\\" and particularly due to the strong distrust influential Catholic clergy had towards the League.Galvin, Michael M.: Kilmurry 1906-1910; People and Politics The Year of Two Elections 1910, D.D. Sheehan Triumphant, pp.78,99, Kilmurry Archaeological and Historical Society, Carrig Print (2011) In all but two cases, the clergy acted substantially united behind Irish Party candidates,Miller, David W.: pp.258, pp.264‚Äì67 so that in the twenty-three constituencies AFIL candidates contested in the December 1910 election, the Church‚Äôs forces were thoroughly mobilised against O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs League,Miller, David W.: p.266 contributing to the subsequent polarisation of the political landscape. From 1915 members of the League were defecting to Sinn F√©in,O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: p. 217 quote: \\"The County Inspector (RIC) reported to headquarters in 1915 that the Irish Volunteers (the IRB faction) in West Cork were composed of men who had formerly given their allegiance to O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs All- for-Ireland League\\" the editorial of O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs Cork Free Press stating in the issue of 30 September \\"It is to Sinn F√©in that Ireland must now look to mould the future of her people\\".O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.223 O‚ÄôBrien was convinced that the only dignified course was to stand aside and let Sinn F√©in exert pressure on England to come to terms.O‚ÄôBrien, Joseph V.: p.235 The party did not contest the December 1918 election. Despite this, the AFIL continues to historically exert a certain fascination, undoubtedly due to the many strands encompassed underneath its umbrella. It was both an urban working-class and an agrarian-based movement, focused on reforming the political landscape in Ireland. O'Brien's oft quoted policy of 'the three Cc' is too readily dismissed by historians eager to hasten from the turbulent 1910 elections to events beyond the Home Rule crisis of 1912-14. Missing in so doing, to acknowledge the AFIL's mere existence, its actions and more importantly its rhetoric. The criticisms, arguments and the many plans it put forward for alternative Home Rule call for more thorough examination. A scrutiny of the social background and outlook of those nationalists and unionists who supported the AFIL during a vibrant period of modern Irish history could provide further insight into their cohesive interests, sympathies and traditions. The AFIL's claim to be heard in this regard deserves further study.O‚ÄôDonovan, John: pp.163,141 League's Anthem \\"The Irish People\\" March 1909 and O'Brien's vision: United Ireland a Nation ‚Äì The One, and Only Hope!

Places nearby include Stichill, Sprouston, Nenthorn, Eccles, Gordon, Greenlaw as well as Floors Castle. The village was formerly in Roxburghshire. Its name is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon \\"Edenham\\", i.e. the town on Eden Water. Near the village is a knoll called The Piper's Grave. It is named after a legend that a local piper once went searching for fairies in the hill, and was never seen again. People from Ednam *Very Rev Prof J. H. S. Burleigh - Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1960. Ednam is notable for having been associated with several Scottish poets, namely Henry Francis Lyte, writer of Abide With Me; William Wright, John Gibson Smith and James Thomson, writer of Rule Britannia. Other people associated with Ednam include William Purves, a banker. John 'Coocke' or 'Cuke'- grandfather of Captain Cook also came from here. Lastly, Thor Longus who re-populated and re-established the wasteland of Ednam after a grant in the early 1100s by King Edgar of Scotland under the Princedom of David I of Scotland, Prince of Cumbria. Thor Longus may have been the progenitor of the Laing family of the Borders Counties of Berwickshire, Roxburgshire, and Dumfriesshire, where numerous Laing/Lange (Latin: Long(us)) meaning \\"tall or long\\" in Scots resided since at least the 1100's according to written Burgess roles of Dumfries and Berwick as well as the infamous Ragman Roll of 1296AD (Edward I) and Berwick Roll of 1333AD (Edward III). The Laings are believed to be descendants of Roman auxiliary troops stationed in Northern Britain near Hadrians Wall (Carlisle to Newcastle) (based on modern Y DNA research) along with other modern Border familiesfrom Numidia/Mauretania in N Africa or Hispania where Numidians/Mauretanians settled in early Roman Republic/Empire in the 200BC to 60AD period of Roman history. As recorded in the book published in 1860 by Edmonston and Douglas Publishers of Edinburgh named \\"Concerning Some Scotch Surnames\\" (reprinted as \\"The Old Scots Surnames: Secrets and Origins of Your Name\\" by John Menzies Publishers), the authors state on page 16: \\"A Northman who was the first colonizer of Ednam in the Merse, was named Thor.

Manton was a sport shooter in his own right and a friend of Colonel Peter Hawker.Kings Of The Trigger - Biographical Sketches Of Four Famous Sportsmen: The Rev. W.B. Daniel, Colonel Peter Hawker, Joe Manton and Captain Horatio Ross, by Thormanby, Published 1901, London Gunsmith From 1780-1781, Manton was first apprenticed to a gunmaker in Grantham, Newton. He worked under his elder brother John from 1781 onward. Joseph Manton, Gunmaker, London (1766-1835) , Museum Victoria He produced around 100 weapons annually, including both cased duelling pistols and shotguns.\\"...a cased pair of Joseph Manton dueling pistols that produced the top price of the collection\\", Antiques Trade Gazette Tube lock In the early-19th century, Manton invented the tube (or pill) lock, an improvement over Alexander Forsyth's scent-bottle lock.Kinard, J, Pistols an illustrated history (2004) p.52-54 Rather than storing a reserve of fulminate in a container, they now used single-use pellets or pills. The hammer of the gun was sharpened; when it fell, it crushed the tube/pellet, causing the fulminates to detonate. Although more reliable than Forsyth's design and adopted by many sportsmen during the Regency period (and a variant for the Austrian army),\\"The story of the Augustin tube lock ignition system\\", CapAndBall.eu it was quickly overshadowed by the percussion cap, which was adopted by the armies of Britain, France, Russia, and America to replace the flintlock.Ricketts, H, Firearms (London, 1962) Artillery The greater part of Manton's career was spent at loggerheads with the British Army. Manton managed to interest the army in purchasing a larger version of his wooden cup design to be used in rifled artillery. Manton worked tirelessly to improve cannon's firing accuracy. He created a new type of ammunition. First, the ammunition was loaded in a rifled cannon. Secondly, the cannonball was attached to the wooden cup that fitted into the rifled grooves of the cannon, which was in turn connected to a sack of gunpowder, thus eliminating the need for powder and shot to be loaded separately. The idea of fixing the powder behind the shot in a disposable cartridge is the basis for modern bullet design. It helped pave the way for breech-loading weaponry. =Lost sale= The army provided Manton a cannon and funding, and in return expected a greatly improved weapon. Manton's design was superior, although an argument over payment caused the army to declare it of little benefit. A row erupted over how Manton was to be paid; he believed the agreement was to be a ¬£30,000 lump sum. The army argued that since they had already invested money (sunk costs) into research and development, they did not want to pay such a huge amount of money for a design that had not been field tested. Manton patented his design, forcing the Army to deal. The army offered him one farthing for each shell they produced, but Manton refused this offer. Surprisingly for Manton, the army stood its ground. Manton was frightened that he had spent time and money (including some of his own) developing a weapon that the army would not use. The Army rejected his offer, whereby the army could make the shells without paying royalties, while Manton would make the wooden cups. His design was more reliable than Forsyth's design and adopted by many sportsmen during the Regency period (and by the Austrian army). After more than a decade of unsuccessful legal battles, Manton lost his vast fortunes and was declared bankrupt in 1826. His Oxford Street workshop was seized and his stock of guns bought by Joseph Lang, an aspiring gun dealer whose company would eventually become part of Atkin, Grant and Lang. Lang is credited with opening one of the first shooting schools in the premises adjoining the Royal Theatre Haymarket. Legacy Manton's weapons remain some of the most highly sought-after designs of the flintlock age and can fetch more at auction than Holland & Holland's shotguns. His workforce included James Purdey (who went on to found Purdey's), Thomas Boss, William Greener, Charles Lancaster and William Moore.

They are native to northern South America east of the Andes, known roughly from the area corresponding to the Guiana Shield, as well as to the coastal area of Bahia, Brazil. Whether the genus is truly distinct from Phyzelaphryne remains uncertain. Common name shield frogs has been proposed for this genus, although the stem flea frog is used for some species. Etymology The generic name is derived from the Greek words adelos, meaning \\"unseen, unknown, obscure\\", and phryne for \\"toad\\". It refers to the fact that these small frogs were seldom collected until relatively lately. Description Adelophryne are small leaf- litter frogs. Adults of the largest species, A. patamona, measure no more than in snout‚Äìto‚Äìvent length and the remaining all are less than . At in males and in females, A. michelin is not only the smallest in the genus, but among the smallest frogs of the Americas, with only a few Brachycephalus species, Eleutherodactylus iberia and E. limbatus being of roughly similar size. The pupil of Adelophryne is oval and horizontally oriented. The tympanum is distinct. The digits are flattened and have asymmetrically pointed, laterally grooved, elongate discs. No webbing is present. The fourth finger is reduced in size. Males have a large, external subgular vocal sac. Reproduction is through direct development, that is, eggs hatch directly into froglets, without free-living larval (tadpole) stage. Before this was confirmed for Adelophryne maranguapensis, the relatively large size of the eggs in this genus led many researcher to conclude that direct development was likely to be present. Species As of late 2019, there are ten species: * Adelophryne adiastola Hoogmoed and Lescure, 1984 * Adelophryne baturitensis Hoogmoed, Borges, and Cascon, 1994 * Adelophryne glandulata Louren√ßo de Moraes, Ferreira, Fouquet, and Bastos, 2014 * Adelophryne gutturosa Hoogmoed and Lescure, 1984 * Adelophryne maranguapensis Hoogmoed, Borges, and Cascon, 1994 * Adelophryne meridionalis Santana, Fonseca, Neves, and Carvalho, 2012 * Adelophryne michelin Louren√ßo-de-Moraes, Dias, Mira-Mendes, de Oliveira, Barth, Ruas, Vences, Sol√©, and Bastos, 2018 * Adelophryne mucronatus Louren√ßo- de-Moraes, Sol√©, and Toledo, 2012 * Adelophryne pachydactyla Hoogmoed, Borges, and Cascon, 1994 * Adelophryne patamona MacCulloch, Lathrop, Kok, Minter, Khan, and Barrio-Amoros, 2008 The genus is likely to contain several undescribed species.

Southern Energy Homes, Inc. 305 F.3d 1268 (11th Cir. 2002) The act was sponsored by Senator Warren G. Magnuson of Washington and U.S. Representative John E. Moss of California, both Democrats, as well as Senator Frank Moss of Utah, who co-sponsored it with Magnuson. The statute is remedial and is intended to protect consumers from deceptive warranty practices. Consumer products are not required to have warranties, but if one is given, it must comply with the Magnuson-Moss Act.  Definitions used  The Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Act contains many definitions: * A \\"consumer\\" is a buyer of consumer goods for personal use. A buyer of consumer products for resale is not a consumer. * A \\"supplier\\" is any person engaged in the business of making a consumer product directly or indirectly available to consumers. * A \\"warrantor\\" is any supplier or other person who gives or offers a written warranty or who has some obligation under an implied warranty. * A \\"consumer product\\" is generally any tangible personal property for sale and that is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes. It is important to note that the determination whether a good is a consumer product requires a factual finding, on a case-by-case basis. Najran Co. for General Contracting and Trading v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., 659 F. Supp. 1081 (S.D. Ga. 1986). * A \\"written warranty\\" (also called an express warranty) is any written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product by a supplier to a consumer that relates to the material and/or workmanship and that affirms that the product is defect-free or will meet a certain standard of performance over a specified time. * An \\"implied warranty\\" is defined in state law. The Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Act simply provides limitations on disclaimers and provides a remedy for their violation. * Designations: ** A \\"full warranty\\" is one that meets the federal minimum standards for a warranty. Such warranties must be \\"conspicuously designated\\" as full warranties. If each of the following five statements is true about a warranty's terms and conditions, it is a \\"full\\" warranty: *** There is no limit on the duration of implied warranties. *** Warranty service is provided to anyone who owns the product during the warranty period; that is, the coverage is not limited to first purchasers. *** Warranty service is provided free of charge, including such costs as returning the product or removing and reinstalling the product when necessary. *** There is provided, at the consumer's choice, either a replacement or a full refund if, after a reasonable number of tries, the warrantor is unable to repair the product. *** It is not required of consumers to perform any duty as a precondition for receiving service, except notifying that service is needed, unless it can be demonstrated that the duty is reasonable. ** A \\"limited warranty\\" is one that does not meet the federal minimums. Such warranties must be \\"conspicuously designated\\" as limited warranties. * A \\"multiple warranty\\" is part full and part limited. * A \\"service contract\\" is different from a warranty because service contracts do not affirm the quality or workmanship of a consumer product. A service contract is a written instrument in which a supplier agrees to perform, over a fixed period or for a specified duration, services relating to the maintenance or repair, or both, of a consumer product. Agreements that meet the statutory definition of service contracts, but are sold and regulated under state law as contracts of insurance, do not come under the Act's provisions. * Disclaimer or Limitation of Implied Warranties when a service contract is sold: Sellers of consumer products who make service contracts on their products are prohibited under the act from disclaiming or limiting implied warranties. Sellers who extend written warranties on consumer products cannot disclaim implied warranties, regardless of whether they make service contracts on their products. However, sellers of consumer products that merely sell service contracts as agents of service contract companies and do not themselves extend written warranties can disclaim implied warranties on the products they sell.  Requirements  Any warrantor warranting a consumer product to a consumer by means of a written warranty must disclose, fully and conspicuously, in simple and readily understood language, the terms and conditions of the warranty to the extent required by rules of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has enacted regulations governing the disclosure of written consumer product warranty terms and conditions on consumer products actually costing the consumer more than $5. The Rules can be found at 16 C.F.R. Part 700. Under the terms of the Act, ambiguous statements in a warranty are construed against the drafter of the warranty. Likewise, service contracts must fully, clearly, and conspicuously disclose their terms and conditions in simple and readily understood language. Warrantors cannot require that only branded parts be used with the product in order to retain the warranty.15 USC 2302(c) This is commonly referred to as the \\"tie-in sales\\" provisions and is frequently mentioned in the context of third-party computer parts, such as memory and hard drives. =Full Warranty Requirements= Under a full warranty, in the case of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with the written warranty, the warrantor: * can remedy the consumer product within a reasonable time and without charge; * may not impose any limitation on the duration of any implied warranty on the product; * may not exclude or limit consequential damages for a breach of any written or implied warranty on the product, unless the exclusion or limitation conspicuously appears on the face of the warranty; and * if the product, or a component part, contains a defect or malfunction, must permit the consumer to elect either a refund or replacement without charge, after a reasonable number of repair attempts. In addition, the warrantor may not impose any duty, other than notification, upon any consumer, as a condition of securing the repair of any consumer product that malfunctions, is defective, or does not conform to the written warranty. However, the warrantor may require consumers to return a defective item to its place of purchase for repair.  Limitations  The Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Warranty Act does not invalidate or restrict any right or remedy of any consumer under any other federal law, nor does the act supersede the Federal Trade Commission Act as it pertains to antitrust actions. The act does not invalidate or restrict any right or remedy of any consumer under state law. The act is not the dominant regulation of consumer product warranties, and while it prescribes certain disclosures and restricts certain limitations on warranties, it leaves other warranty law untouched.Richardson v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 254 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 2001) Although the act covers warranties on repair or replacement parts in consumer products, warranties on services for repairs are not covered. The federal minimum standards for full warranties are waived if the warrantor can show that the problem associated with a warranted consumer product was caused by damage while in the possession of the consumer, or by unreasonable use, including a failure to provide reasonable and necessary maintenance.  Remedies under the Act  The act is meant to provide consumers with access to reasonable and effective remedies where there is a breach of warranty on a consumer product. The act provides for informal dispute-settlement procedures and for actions brought by the government and by private parties. The FTC has been mandated by Congress to promulgate rules to encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution, and full warranties may require mediation and/or arbitration as a first step toward settling disputes. In addition, the federal government has the authority to take injunctive action against a supplier or warrantor who fails to meet the requirements of the act. Finally, consumers may seek redress in the courts for alleged violations of the Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Act. A consumer who has been injured by a supplier's noncompliance may bring an action in federal court if the amount in controversy is over $50,000 or a class action if the number of class plaintiffs is greater than 100. If the jurisdictional amount, or number of plaintiffs, does not meet these thresholds, an action under the act may be brought only in state court.See 15 U.S.C. 2310(d)(1)-(3) Moreover, one of the key aids to the effectiveness of the act is that a prevailing plaintiff may recover reasonable costs of suit, including attorney fees.15 U.S.C. 2310(d)(2).

Biography Stone was born near Richmond in Madison County, Kentucky on May 7, 1848, and attended Richmond's public schools as a child; he graduated from the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1867, whereupon he began the study of law. Admitted to the bar in 1869, he began practice that year in Bedford, Indiana. Soon he moved back to Columbia, where he was the city attorney for a time in 1870. Later that year he moved to Nevada, Missouri, and continued his practice, becoming the Vernon County prosecuting attorney from 1873 to 1874 and was a presidential elector for the Democratic ticket in 1876. His son, Kimbrough Stone, was born in 1875. In 1884 Stone was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served until 1891; he did not seek renomination in 1890. In his time there he served as the chairman of the Committee on War Claims. From 1893 to 1897 he served as Missouri's governor, moving to Jefferson City in 1893. Beginning in 1896 he served as a member of the Democratic National Committee, serving in this capacity until 1904; he was the committee's vice-chairman from 1900 until his departure. In 1897 Stone moved to St. Louis, where he continued his practice; he returned to Jefferson City in 1903. In 1902 he was elected to the Senate, being reelected in 1908 and serving until his death. Stone served as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and chaired that important committee from 1913 until his death. In this capacity, he was involved in disagreements with the Wilson administration concerning European policy before the U.S. entry into World War I. He was one of the six U.S. Senators who voted against the United States declaration of war against Germany on April 4, 1917 (the other five were Asle J. Gronna, Republican from North Dakota, Robert M. La Follette, Republican from Wisconsin, Harry Lane, Democrat from Oregon, George W. Norris, Republican from Nebraska, and James K. Vardaman, Democrat from Mississippi). He supported acquisition of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Stone also served at various times as chairman of the Committee on Additional Accommodations for the Library, the Committee on Revolutionary Claims, the Committee on Corporations Organized in the District of Columbia, and the Committee on Indian Affairs. Stone died in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1918; he is buried in Nevada, Missouri. His seat was filled until the 1918 election by Xenophon P. Wilfley.

Tommaso Baldasarre Crudeli (Poppi, December 21, 1702 - Poppi, March 27, 1745) was a Florentine free thinker who was imprisoned by the Roman Inquisition.http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/crudeli_t/crudeli_t.html He was a poet, lawyer, champion of free thought and is remembered as the first martyr of Universal Freemasonry. Tomaso was born into a wealthy family from the Casentino (upper Arno), whose history dated back to the 12th century, albeit with several changes of name. The eponym is related to the story of the expulsion of Count Guidi from the castle of Poppi in 1440. Eventually, turning to Jacopo Crusca, leader of the revolt, he said \\"Vos quoque crudeles\\" and got the answer \\"in crudelitates fides\\". From this episode the family was appointed as \\"Crudeli\\" (meaning \\"cruels\\"). The Palazzo Crudeli (15th century) was the most important building after the castle and churches within the walls of Poppi, thanks to the economic strength of the family. The prosperity of the lineage is also understandable as all generations have graduated from the University of Pisa continuously since 1502. Tommaso was the seventh graduating in Utroque jure in Pisa in 1726. His mentor was Bernardo Tanucci (Premier of Naples and Sicily Kingdom) during the preparation of studies and university years. Tommaso stayed in Venice with the Counts Contarini, before returning to Florence as professor of Italian into English Colony. For his lively intellect and his boldness, Tommaso was initiated on May 5, 1735 into the English Lodge, an offshoot of the Grand Lodge of England, and the first Masonic Lodge in Italy. He became secretary, but later became a scapegoat for the growing conflict between the Vatican and the English Freemasonry. Tommaso suffered a long imprisonment (May 1739-April 1741) on uncertain charges, which was later commuted to perpetual house arrest. Bed-bound at the end of his life, he died from the after-effects of torture and imprisonment on 27 March 1745 in Poppi. He had time to dictate a long report ordered by the Grand Duke on the basis of which the Inquisition Tribunal of Florence was finally closed, in 1744, while Tommaso was still alive. The Roman Inquisition as a whole was increasingly limited from the mid-18th Century as nobles sought to curtail its power.

Born in Trebizond and patronized by Michael Maleinos, he studied at Constantinople and became famous there as Abraham, a fervent preacher who held great authority with Michael's nephew, Nicephoros Phocas. By the time Phocas ascended the imperial throne, Abraham, ill at ease with the lax morals of the monks living in the capital, changed his name to Athanasios and joined the monks at Mount Kyminas in Bithynia. In 958, he relocated to Mount Athos. He helped defend the hermits, or sketes, there against the Saracens, and also started to incorporate the sketes already there into what would eventually become known as the Great Lavra, which Athanasios built with the financial assistance of Nicephoros. This monastery was dedicated in 963. It is still in use today, and is often referred to by people of the area simply as \\"Lavra\\", or \\"The Monastery\\". Three other foundations followed shortly thereafter, with all three of them remaining in place to the present. Athanasios met with considerable opposition from the hermits already at Mount Athos in the construction of his monasteries. They resented his intrusion and his attempts to bring order and discipline to their lives. Upon Nicephoros' death the enemies of Athanasios prevailed and he had to leave Athos for Cyprus, where he lived until the new emperor, John Tzimisces, resumed the patronage of the Great Lavra and bestowed upon the monastery its first charter in 971. Athanasios, spurred by a divine vision, returned at once to Athos as a hegumen (abbot) and introduced a typicon for cenobites, based on those compiled by Theodore Studites and Basil of Caesarea. He died during an accident, killed by a falling masonry, when the cupola of his church collapsed. Upon his death, Athanasios was glorified as a saint. His feast day is July 5.

Taxonomy Placement of Dischidodactylus in the subfamily Ceuthomantinae (=Pristimantinae), family Craugastoridae, is based on morphology because no DNA sequence data are available. Dischidodactylus is closely related to Ceuthomantis, with which they share a synapomorphy: completely or almost completely divided ungual flaps. Both genera also have dorsal skin composed of small, flat, pliable (not keratinized) warts, and lack nuptial pads in adult males. They differ in that Dischidodactylus possess a dentigerous process of the vomer, and in that Ceuthomantis lack basal toe webbing. However, the AmphibiaWeb places Dischidodactylus in an entirely different family, Strabomantidae, implying a distant relationship with Ceuthomantis. Description Dischidodactylus are smallish frogs that reach a maximum snout‚Äìvent length of in females. Their head is not as wide as body.

He is best known for his staunch, if unsuccessful, defence of Maidstone in the Royalist cause, during the English Civil War. Early life William Brockman was born in England in 1595, at Lyminge in Kent, the son of Henry Brockman and Helen (Sawkins). He was educated at Oxford University and married an heiress: Ann (Bunce), the only daughter of Dorothy and Simon Bunce, Esq., of Lynsted on 28 May 1616. The couple had seven children the first born son, Henry, and a daughter died in infancy. In 1632, William Brockman, Esq., was knighted by King Charles I. The Battle of Maidstone On the outbreak of the Civil War, the recently- knighted Sir William Brockman remained loyal to King Charles I and the Royalist cause. In 1642, Sir William was appointed High Sheriff of Kent by the King, but almost immediately he was arrested and imprisoned in Winchester Palace in Southwark, in London. The action seemed to have been a tactic to remove potentially influential Royalist supporters from the scene, and Brockman was replaced as Sheriff by Sir John Honeywood. William remained in custody until August 1645, although from June 1644 he transferred back to Kent, on the grounds that his health was deteriorating in the squalid London prison, to the fortified manor house known as Westenhanger Castle, only a couple of miles from his home at Beachborough. In 1648, when the second period of conflict flared up, Sir William became directly involved in the fighting for the first and only time, under the command of Sir John Mayney. Separated from the main loyalist forces, the detachment in Maidstone had to fight unsupported against a large force of the New Model Army, under Sir Thomas Fairfax, or Lord Fairfax of Cameron as he had just become, having inherited the family peerage from the Kingdom of Scotland. Fairfax marched on Maidstone, with his division of veteran troops, numbering approximately 6, 000 men. The garrison initially comprised approximately 1, 000 men, but some of these were apparently sailors and some were raw recruits. Lord Fairfax crossed the river at East Farleigh Bridge and prepared to storm the town. Meanwhile, the Royalist strength had been boosted by Sir William, who had managed to bring in a large force of reinforcements, numbering about 800 men, during the preliminary skirmishing. The assault began about seven o'clock that evening, in driving rain. The resistance of the townsmen was determined and the battle gradually spread out into every street. Royalists fought from hasty barricades in the streets and from the houses on either side. The conflict degenerated into house-to-house fighting. The battle continued in this way until midnight, still in rain, around which time the surviving Royalists were driven into a churchyard where they regrouped and prepared for the next phase. They were eventually persuaded to surrender on conditions that guaranteed their personal safety. Fairfax's report to Parliament confirms that Sir William and the other leaders were captured, and so began Sir William's second period of imprisonment. In somewhat flowery prose, the 1836 edition of Burke's Commoners summed up the Battle of Maidstone as follows: \\"Few actions displayed more of that chivalric courage and devoted resolve which characterised the adherents of the King during the civil wars than this. Lord Clarendon terms it a sharp encounter very bravely fought with the general's whole strength\\". =The Battle Report of Lord Fairfax= The Brockman arms. These were unchanged from the original grant, in 1606, to Sir William's father, Henry. Beachborough Park, in Kent: the Brockman family's estate. The image dates from the time of Sir William's grandson, William Brockman, MP. Letter from L. Fairfax, with an Account of the Victory over the Kentish Forces at Maidstone: Later life Records show that William was still a prisoner in 1651, when he, his brother Zouch and many other Royalists were declared delinquents and had heavy fines levied against them: Sir William was fined ¬£500 and Zouch ¬£350. It is not known when William was released on this second occasion. However, perhaps more importantly, Sir William was able to avoid the sequestration of his estate during his two periods of imprisonment and was able to pass this on intact after his death in 1654. Sir William's burial took place on 6 December 1654 and the estate was inherited by his heir, James. Sir William came from a family already long-established in Kent, which possessed a number of properties in Kent at that time. Around 1500, William's great grandfather Henry Brockman bought Cheriton Manor, Newington Manor and Beachborough Manor. Henry Brockman's grandson was also called Henry, and was the father of Sir William. He is commemorated by a tablet in St Nicholas Church,St Nicholas, Newington Next Hythe Newington. As one of very few notable and documented Kentish Englishmen from his era, Sir William is of some interest to descendants of his relatives that now live in the US and Australia today. For example, it appears that in the aftermath of the civil war his second cousin, Henry Brockman, fled the country to Aruba and eventually to the American colonies, thus founding the English branch of the Brockman family in the United States. Later, descendants through the maternal Drake-Brockman line emigrated to Australia, several of whom were notable for their military and civic leadership.

Works of science and mathematics, such as Euclid's Elements, are generally not represented. Since the books are meant primarily for serious students of the classics, the prefaces and notes have traditionally been in Latin (so that the books are written in the classical languages from the title page to the index), and no translations or explanatory notes are included.

The common name coined for them is Guanabara frogs. They are endemic to Atlantic coastal forests in the southeastern Brazilian states Esp√≠rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. The name Euparkerella honours H. W. Parker, a herpetologist who named the type species, with the Greek prefix eu meaning true and suffix ella, a diminutive form. Taxonomy The phylogenetic position of Euparkerella is uncertain as they have not been included in any molecular phylogeny. On the basis of their morphological similarity to Holoaden, they are provisionally placed in subfamily Holoadeninae. The AmphibiaWeb keeps Holoadeninae, and consequently Euparkerella, in Strabomantidae, a family no longer recognized by the Amphibian Species of the World. Euparkerella species are traditionally distinguished using morphological traits. However, these species do not align well with genetically distinct units, with the latter suggesting higher diversity than the former, especially within Euparkerella brasiliensis and Euparkerella cochranae. It remains unresolved whether the genetically distinct units qualify as different species. Description Euparkerella are small frogs, growing to snout‚Äìvent length at most.

History The band's name comes from two sources: \\"Hot Club\\" from the hot jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist Stephane Grappelli's Quintette du Hot Club de France, and \\"Cowtown\\" from the western influence of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys and other early Western swing combos, as well as the band's love of fiddle tunes, hoedowns, and songs of the American west. Whit Smith (from Cape Cod, Massachusetts) and Elana James (from Prairie Village, Kansas) met through an ad in the classified music section of The Village Voice in 1994. They played together in New York City before moving to San Diego in 1997, where they spent a year playing for tips and building up their repertoire. In 1998 they moved to Austin, Texas and two years later added Jake Erwin (from Tulsa, Oklahoma) on bass. The band split briefly in 2005, though they reunited for occasional shows in 2005‚Äì07, including the Fuji Rock Festival and a tour of Australia as Elana James & The Hot Club of Cowtown, in 2007. Whit Smith performed as Whit Smith's Hot Jazz Caravan, based in Austin, Texas. Elana toured with Bob Dylan in 2005. Changing her last name to James, Elana began performing with her own trio in late 2005. Smith and James resumed playing together full-time in 2006. By early 2008 the Hot Club of Cowtown had officially re-formed. Recordings The Hot Club's first album, 1998's Swingin' Stampede is a collection of standards, fiddle tunes, and classic Western Swing songs, including two written by Bob Wills. Their 1999 follow-up album, Tall Tales, includes original songs by Smith and James, including Darling You And I Are Through by James, and Emily and When I Lost You by Smith, as well as more Western Swing standards by Bob Wills, Pee Wee King, and others. Later albums continued to mix classic Western Swing and hot jazz, with originals in the same style; including the studio albums, Ghost Train (2002) and Wishful Thinking (2009). Their 2011 album What Makes Bob Holler was a tribute to Bob Wills. The disc includes obscure B-sides with some of Wills' most popular work, including Big Balls in Cowtown and Stay a Little Longer, Osage Stomp and The Devil Ain't Lazy. In 2016, the Hot Club of Cowtown released its ninth studio album, Midnight on the Trail (Gold Strike Records), a vintage mix of 12 Western swing songs and cowboy ballads \\"hand-collected to reflect the spirit and joy of the American West,\\" including traditional songs as well as works by Cindy Walker, Gene Autry, Bob Wills, Johnny Mercer, and more. The band's previous release, \\"Rendezvous in Rhythm\\" (Gold Strike Records, 2013) was a collection of hot jazz standards and gypsy instrumentals played acoustically in the style of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli (The Quintette of the Hot Club of France). The Hot Club of Cowtown released a live DVD, \\"Continental Dance Party,\\" in 2012 which was filmed at the Continental Club Gallery in Austin, Texas. In 2017, in recognition of the band's 20th anniversary, the Hot Club of Cowtown re-released their first set of recordings, Western Clambake, a cassette which had previously been released in 1997 when the band played for tips in and around San Diego, California at farmers' markets, local cafes and coffee houses, and Balboa Park. Most recently, the Hot Club of Cowtown has released its 11th studio album, Wild Kingdom, on September 27, 2019 a fourteen-track collection of three standards and eleven new, original songs by the band about subjects as varied as cavemen, Mongolian stallions, vintage candy, rodeo pick up men, and the real meaning of \\"Last Call.\\" Awards & Live Performances The Hot Club of Cowtown continues to tour year-round, primarily in the US and the UK. In 2013, the Hot Club of Cowtown was nominated for the first-ever Ameripolitan Music Awards, held in Austin, Texas in 2014, in the Best Western Swing Group category. The band was nominated again for the Ameripolitan Music Awards the following year (2015) and won Western Swing Group of the Year, as Elana James won Western Swing Female of the year. \\"Often people at our shows, old-timers from West Texas, will come up and tell us that what they really like is those traditional, Romanian-sounding songs. This was the antidote to our Western swing CD. Our band is better known as a western swing act, and even though Western swing includes all kinds of jazzy bluesy idioms from back in the day, the western and country part of it are so prominent that it tends to overshadow the purely jazzy European side,\\" said James. In January and February 2011, they toured with Roxy Music as the opening act on Roxy's UK leg of their For Your Pleasure tour. Festivals/career highlights include the Women in Jazz series (part of Jazz at Lincoln Center), the Cambridge Folk Festival (UK), the Glastonbury Festival (UK), the Fuji Rock Festival (Japan), Byron Bay Blues & Roots Festival (AU), the National Folk Festival (US and AU), the Stagecoach Festival, the Winnipeg Folk Festival (CA), Waiting for Waits Festival (SP), the grand opening of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, The Barns at Wolf Trap, the Rochester Jazz Festival, the Strawberry Festival, the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, traveling as US State Department Musical Ambassadors to Azerbaijan, Armenia, Algeria, the Republic of Georgia, and the Sultanate of Oman, and being inducted into the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame.

The school, with 480 pupils, takes boys from 11‚Äì18 and girls from 16‚Äì18.Shiplake College ‚Äì Admissions History Shiplake College was founded in 1959 by Alexander and Eunice Everett. The land on which the school now stands was bought by Robert Harrison in 1888 and the original buildings date from 1890. The main building, which houses Skipwith House and the Great Hall, was built as a private residence for the Harrison family. The house was sold in 1925 and was at first a private home to Edward Goulding, 1st Baron Wargrave and then a prep school, before being sold to the BBC in 1941. Initially the BBC used Shiplake Court as a storage facility until in 1943 the BBC Monitoring Service moved to Caversham and the house became a hostel for BBC staff. The BBC closed the hostel in 1953 and the house remained largely unused until the arrival of the Everetts in 1958. The College now stands in 45 acres of land on the banks of the Thames. In late 1958 the Everetts purchased Shiplake Court with the intention of founding a school, which duly opened as Shiplake Court on 1 May 1959. In 1963 John Eggar, a Derbyshire cricketer who had been a housemaster at Repton School, became headmaster and in 1964 renamed the school Shiplake College. By the time he retired in 1979, numbers had increased to 300.The Times Obituary John Eggar Saturday 7 May 1983 Girls aged 16‚Äì18 were introduced towards the end of the 20th Century, forming a co-educational Sixth Form. Houses The pupils are allocated into one of eight houses with boys becoming members of either Orchard or Skipwith (if they are day boys) or Burr, Everett or Welsh (if they are boarders). Girls are members of Gilson House, whilst Upper Sixth boys reside in College. Pupils in years 7 and 8 are members of the Lower School. Co-curricular activities Two afternoons per week are dedicated towards co-curricular activities and clubs. Pupils help out at the Kikunduku schools project and participate in a wide range of other activities such as climbing Mount Kenya. Sport The Good Schools Guide notes that \\"Rugby, rowing, hockey, cricket, athletics and netball plus a good smattering of minor sports and house fixtures are important, improving, inclusive and competitive (notable successes against much bigger rivals). In line with school spirit, fixture boards welcome the opposition and wish them luck.\\"Good Schools Guide Review Rowing is a school sport, with the College located on the banks of the River Thames. Shiplake crews recently have won Schools Head of the River in 2017 and 2019 and the Child Beale Cup at National Schools' Regatta in 2015. Several boys have represented England and Great Britain.Four Shiplake Oarsmen Help Pull GB to Victory . Most notably, former pupil Will Satch claimed an Olympic Gold medal at Rio 2016 in the Men's Eight, and an Olympic Bronze medal at London 2012 in the Men's Pair event.Will Satch British Rowing Profile. As well as rowing, the College plays rugby. Former pupil Tom Howe now plays for London Wasps.

Early years John Simmons was born in Birmingham, England, in 1915. He joined the library at Birmingham University as a \\"library boy\\" in 1932, and in 1934 began to study Russian under Professor Konovalov. He graduated in 1937 with a BA in Spanish and Russian, but chose to stay on at the university as an assistant librarian, beginning a DPhil on the history of Russian printing. This was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. On his first trip to Russia, he met his wife, Fanny, whom he married in 1944. Adult life After service in World War II and three more years at Birmingham University, Simmons moved to Oxford after an invitation to take up a job as librarian/lecturer in charge of Slavonic books at Oxford University. This position was created for him by his old tutor Konovalov. Due to his actions in August 1953, when he travelled to Moscow to propose to the director of the Lenin Library a book exchange, the University received thousands of valuable, out-of-print Russian publications. Simmons was instrumental in building up the retrospective collections of Russian books in the Taylorian and Bodleian Libraries and the creation in the Bodleian of the only specialised Slavonic reading room in the country. He believed that it was these library collections along with a group of Russian academic teachers recruited by Serge Konovalov, Maurice Bowra, and Isaiah Berlin, that led to the establishment of Oxford as the only centre for Slavonic studies in England. Later years John Simmons remained an important figure in the field of Slavonics right to his death in September 2005. His Sandars lectures, given in Cambridge in 1974 are still the only serious English-language history of Russian printing. In 1985 he formed an institution named The 4Cs Club. The '4 Cs' stood for his four 'categoricals': Conserve, Consider, Contribute, Co-operate. Invitations were given out to scholars that he deemed similar to himself in attitude to learning. The members of the club (who now number over 200 in 19 countries) were given club ties (brooches for women were introduced at a later date) and encouraged to wear them on important occasions.

Life and career Don Freed was born in New Westminster, British Columbia and raised in Saskatoon. Freed, who is of M√©tis descent, began his musical career in 1966. In 1969 appeared with Johnny Cash in the documentary Johnny Cash! The Man, His World, His Music. In the film, Freed is shown visiting Cash backstage where he performs two songs, after which Cash promises to get the singer an audition with Columbia Records. He was subsequently signed by Capitol and recorded an album for them in 1972, which was never released. Freed went on to record a number of albums in the early 1980s which were regionally popular in Western Canada including Off in All Directions and Pith and Pathos. Many of Freed's songs about prairie life have been incorporated into high school curricula throughout Saskatchewan. Among performers who have collaborated with Freed on his recordings have been Colin James (who made some of his earliest recordings with Freed), Jane Siberry and actress Linda Griffiths. He also collaborated with Joni Mitchell on her album Taming the Tiger, co-writing the song \\"Crazy Cries of Love\\". Mitchell and Freed were romantically linked in the mid-1990s. Beginning in the early 1990s, Freed began to shift his musical focus from that of being a solo performer to being a promoter of M√©tis and First Nations culture, particularly involving children. His work in teaching songwriting to children in northern Saskatchewan was covered nationally by CBC Newsworld and even earned an article in the American Billboard magazine. Several albums have been released of Freed's collaborations with children, as well as an album of songs called Mystery Boyz created in collaboration with young offenders incarcerated at the North Battleford Youth Centre in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. In 1999, Freed co-wrote Sasquatch Exterminator, a book (with accompanying CD) aimed at teaching Aboriginal language to children. It was produced in conjunction with the Gabriel Dumont Institute. In recent years, Freed has brought his songwriting workshops to the Edmonton Folk Music Festival and to venues throughout the Northwest Territories and Yukon. Freed's most recent CD release is 2005's The Valley of Green and Blue, which celebrates his M√©tis heritage.

It is located near Walmley, Wishaw, Curdworth, Erdington, Water Orton, Thimble End, and Castle Vale. Businesses A large Asda Supercentre is situated on the Minworth border with Walmley. This opened on 3 May 1977 as a Carrefour hypermarket, before being taken over by the Dee Corporation that owned Gateway Foodmarkets and the larger Gateway Superstores in 1987. Since late 1989 it has been an Asda hypermarket, which after Asda was taken over by Walmart in 1999 was branded as an Asda Wal*Mart Supercentre in 2001. By 2007, however, the building was becoming outdated and Asda decided to rebuild it, but after haggling with the local authority Asda decided against this due to the costs demanded for environmental incentives and planning conditions deemed to be excessive by the company. The original store still remains there today. However, the interior of the store was completely remodelled and more or less rebuilt. The exterior was also refreshed and from 2008, the store signage was changed to Asda Supercentre¬Ñ and the Walmart branding was removed. The site has a Wickes DIY store. There is also a B&M; Bargains store overlooking the adjacent site and a Screwfix opposite. Minworth has two pubs: The Hare and Hounds and The Boat, which lie on the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. Minworth Social Club is on Water Orton Lane offers bed and breakfast accommodation as well as social club facilities. Minworth Convenience is a small local shop on Kingsbury Road and opposite this is Mansells offering MOTs and repair services for motorcycles, bicycles and lawnmowers. Motorcycle training is provided by Spirit Rider on the Kingsbury Road and further motorcycle repair services are provided by Flying on Wings Motorcycle Repair, which is adjacent. Also nearby are: Chili Spice Indian takeaway and Hullternative environmental services. On Forge Lane and Maybrook Road there are industrial units including: Selecta (vending); steelworks; Cooke & Son (furniture); Speedy (hire); Safestyle UK and Selco (building). At Midpoint Park there are premises for: The Works (books); Cadbury; Hozelock (hoses) and a paper company. There is also an American Auto Center offering specialist services for US vehicles. Water treatment works Minworth Sewage Treatment Works, east of the village, is Severn Trent's largest treatment works, treating the waste from the equivalent of 1.7 Million people from across Birmingham and the Black Country. The site includes a digester plant to generate biogas, fuelling the plant. History Minworth's name probably came from Mynna's Estate. Minworth and Curdworth both originated in the 6th or 7th centuries, being established by Angle settlers, and are historically associated with the Arden family (William Shakespeare's maternal relations). Peddimore Hall is a double-moated farmstead and can be associated with the Ardens from 1298 until 1659. The present farmhouse can be dated to the 16th century. Minworth was originally a hamlet in the parish of Curdworth in the hundred of Hemlingford. Minworth then became a civil parish in the Castle Bromwich Rural District of Warwickshire from 1894 to 1912, then becoming part of the Meriden Rural District. In 1931 the parish was abolished, with the populated parts being split between Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham, and an area of unpopulated land going to Castle Bromwich parish. Plans to revitalise Minworth in the past have met with a cool reception. A council plan aimed to construct new housing, shops and encourage new industry into the area. However, residents did not back the plan as they wanted Minworth to remain the same. Another plan to develop an patch of land into a canal-side marina also met with disapproval from residents, who did not want the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal to become a busy area.Walmley and its surroundings (Chapter V: Minworth), Douglas V.

The Vestibular usually takes place from November to January, right before the start of school year in February or March, although certain universities hold it every semester. The exams often span several days, usually two, with different disciplines being tested each day. Structure Several Brazilian universities follow the FUVEST (University of S√£o Paulo's entry exam) pattern, which is divided into two stages or \\"phases\\". The first stage consists of 90 multiple choice questions, including subjects such as Portuguese Language, Portuguese Literature and Brazilian Literature; Math, History, Geography, Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Foreign Language. The answers are marked on an answer card, and they are graded afterwards by an automated optical reader. Some institutions establish a cutoff score for the first stage. Students who score below that are automatically eliminated and do not proceed to the second stage, even if the maximum number of candidates has not been reached, although some schools make exceptions in the rare case of most candidates scoring below the cutoff. In some universities, the Vestibular may include only a single-stage exam where the scores for each subject tested are adjusted by weights depending on the student's course choice. For example, on the brazilians unities of PUC (known as one of the most prestigious private universities in Brazil) has a Vestibular consisting of 45 multiple choice questions, one written question about Chemistry and Biology, one about Maths and Physics, and another about History and Geography, in addition to a student-written essay on a provided theme. All of that is done in one single day. Another example is Mackenzie, considered one of the best private universities in the country: its Vestibular consists of 60 multiple choice questions and a student-written essay. In some military engineering colleges such as ITA and IME, the Vestibular includes exams in Math, Physics, Chemistry, Portuguese and English only. Those exams are mostly write-in and demand more from the students when compared to ordinary Vestibular exams of the same subjects by other universities, being heavily influenced by mathematics competitions questions. In the other hand, colleges with a humanities focused curriculum, such as ESPM, only include Portuguese, English, History, Geography, Math and culture. This is done in order to let the student focus on the subjects of the college's interest while preparing for the exams. University candidates must choose their majors by the time they sign in for the Vestibular, and they cannot change their choice except through a very bureaucratic process of internal transfers within the university. Some exceptions exist, such as Engineering in some universities, where the engineering major is chosen only after a three or four semester period. Throughout the last decades, there has always been a gap between the few vacancies offered and the overwhelmingly high and growing demand for high quality and tuition-free public universities. The competition goes as far as having more than 150 candidates per vacancy for the most sought-after careers, such as medicine. Origin The Vestibular was implanted primarily as a way to prevent nepotism or some other form of unfair or beneficial selection of candidates. It was considered by law the only authorized selection method until 1996, when the new Education Law was passed. Criticism  While the Vestibular is generally considered to be a fair and unbiased system to select students due to the standardized nature of the tests, there are a few controversies surrounding it. There is some criticism to the alleged standardization of the high school curriculum for the whole country to match the Vestibular agenda. As with most types of academic evaluation, the Vestibular suffers from the same limitations as a regular test, that is, factors such as stress come into play. It also seems to favor candidates that come from a wealthier background, who had access to better and deeper education in private schools, as opposed to the comparatively poor public high school educational system, although many university boards claim that it doesn't matter which background the candidates have, since their Vestibular aims to select the best students based solely on their knowledge. To ease this problem, some universities such as the Federal University of Minas Gerais, provide a 10‚Äì15% bonus for students who received their middle and high education in public schools. There is also the alternative of taking classes at cram schools called cursinhos (a Brazilian word that usually means \\"Vestibular course\\"). Those are revisions of Vestibular subjects, given through periods of 9 months (the regular year-long one), 6 months (the semi- intensive one), and 3 months (known as intensive). These courses are given usually for the most prestigious schools and can be done after concluding high school or as a complement of the last year of it. Racial quotas Racial and social quotas are a very controversial subject in Brazil. They were implemented by the government as an attempt to minimize the gap between students. That way, students who had their high school education entirely at public schools get quotas. Also, African and Indigenous Brazilian descendants gain a small percentage of bonuses on their Vestibular. That is considered an affirmative action policy. = Court challenge = In August 2005, at Universidade Federal do Paran√°, a student was granted by a federal court the right to be admitted at the university because she had a better score on the Vestibular than several other freshmen that took advantage of their quotas.Estudante ganha a√ß√£o contra sistema de cotas da UFPR In 2012 a law was approved that gave quotas to students who came from public schools. The federal universities (such as UFRJ, UNIFESP, UFPR, UFRGS...) will have to save half of the vacancies for those students. State-owned establishments, such as the University of S√£o Paulo, are not currently forced to abide by this law. New ENEM (Novo ENEM) The Ministry of Education and Culture of Brazil (MEC) proposed in 2009 that the universities should use the ENEM (National High School Exam), a non-mandatory national exam, as a standard university entrance qualification test. The \\"new ENEM\\", as it is known, is composed of 180 multiple choice questions in five main areas (natural sciences, human sciences, math, Portuguese and either English or Spanish as a foreign language) and an essay. The proposal's main objective is to democratize access to higher education, opportunities for federal jobs, academic mobility and induce the restructuring of the curricula of high school.Ser Universit√°rio The universities have the autonomy to choose whether or not they want to use the exam, and if they want to, they can also choose the way it is used: * As a single phase, with a unified system of selection, electronic and online * As the first phase * Combined with the university's test (using it to admit only part of its students or as part of the overall grade, along with a Vestibular) * As a single phase for the remaining chairs See also * Cursinho * Concurso p√∫blico General: *Brazil university rankings *Universities and higher education in Brazil References External links * Mundo Vestibular e Enem * Vestibulando Web: Provas e Vestibular * Official Website of the FUVEST vestibular Category:Education policy in Brazil Category:Standardized tests Category:University and college admissions Category:Race and education Category:Affirmative action ","title":"Vestibular exam"},{"id":"3659553","text":"The Grummore Broch Map showing the territory of the Clan Mackay that was known as Strathnaver in relation to Sutherland and Caithness. The boundary is marked with a dashed line. (click to enlarge) Strathnaver or Strath Naver () is the fertile strath of the River Naver, a famous salmon river that flows from Loch Naver to the north coast of Scotland. The term has a broader use as the name of an ancient province also known as the Mackay Country (), once controlled by the Clan Mackay and extending over most of northwest Sutherland. Geography Loch Naver lies at the head of the strath, in the shadow of Ben Klibreck. The loch is long and deep. The Altnaharra Hotel at the western end of the loch has been used by anglers since the early 19th century. The loch is fed by two rivers (Mudale and Vagastie) and several burns. Just below the loch, the Naver is joined by the River Mallart coming down from Loch Choire. It then flows through the Naver Forest and under the road bridge at Syre. The Langdale Burn and Carnachy Burn are other major tributaries as the strath widens out and flows into the sea at Bettyhill. Most of Strathnaver lies in the ecclesiastical and former civil parish of Farr named after a village on the coast northeast of Bettyhill, where the former parish church now houses the Strathnaver Museum. Today it is administered as part of the Highland Council area. History The Nabaros is mentioned by the Egyptian writer Ptolemy in the 2nd century and is shown on his map. \\\\- good general history of the area. The name may derive from nabh, an Indo-European root meaning \\"cloud\\". There is evidence of Neolithic settlements in the strath, including a \\"village\\" on the raised beach opposite Bettyhill. There are several brochs in the strath and on the hills on either side, including one by Loch Naver at Grummore dating to between 100BC and 100AD. By the eleventh century, the Norwegian family who ruled Orkney and were Earls of Caithness attempted to extend their control into Strathnaver. In the late 12th century, this was halted when they were defeated by local Scots at the Battle of Dalharrold near the east end of Loch Naver. Clan Mackay now came to prominence; in 1408, Angus Dow Mackay attained power and by 1427 was important enough to be one of the chiefs summoned to a parliament in Inverness, where they were arrested by James I. At that time he had 4000 men under his command according to the Scotichronicon; such power led to his nickname of Enneas-en-Imprissi or \\"Angus the Absolute.\\" The Earls of Sutherland contested control of Strathnaver with the Mackays for centuries; in 1230, the courtesy title Lord Strathnaver was created for the heir to the Sutherland earldom. The two families usually took opposing sides; for example, in 1554, the Regent Mary of Guise paid expenses incurred by the 11th Earl of Sutherland to arrest Iye Mackay and bring him to Edinburgh.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10 (1913), 233-4 In 1578, John Robson and Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland fought the men of Strathnaver led by the Mackays in the battle of Creag-Drumi-Doun, up on Druim Chuibhe opposite Bettyhill.. Places Creag-Drumi-Doun at By the middle of the 17th century, their attempts to compete with the more powerful Sutherlands meant the Mackays were under severe financial strain. Despite being devout Presbyterians and Covenanters, they were Royalists during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in part because the Sutherlands were on the opposite side. However, they continued to decline in influence relative to the Sutherlands who purchased the last of their Scottish estates from Lord Reay in 1829. The Scottish general Hugh Mackay settled in the Netherlands in the 1670s and this branch ultimately became hereditary Chiefs of Clan Mackay, holding the titles of Lord Reay in the Scottish peerage and Lord of Ophemert and Zennewijnen in the Netherlands. Strathnaver, like many places in the Highlands, was involved in the Highland Clearances, with the eviction of tenants to allow the creation of large sheep farms. These generated a higher rental income to the Sutherland Estate than the mixed farms that existed in the inland areas of the strath before clearance. A second objective of clearance was to overcome the recurrent years of famine that afflicted the region. The displaced tenants were offered crofts, with some shared grazing, in the coastal regions. The intention was that many would earn a living from fishing, as well as obtaining some subsistence from crops and a few cattle. The people evicted resented this change as a loss of status from farmer to crofter, but this was not understood by the estate when they started implementing their plans in Strathnaver in 1814. The first clearances in Strathnaver involved only 28 families (an estimated 140 people). Eviction notices were given in December 1813 by Patrick Sellar, the estate factor. The notices took effect on Whitsun 1814. Events were complicated by two things. Firstly Sellar had successfully bid for the lease of the sheep farm that the clearance would create. Secondly, the laying out of the land for the new crofts had been seriously delayed - displaced tenants had little time to prepare for their removal. Nevertheless, some departed before the appointed day, whilst others waited for the eviction party's arrival. As was normal practice, the roof timbers of cleared houses were destroyed to prevent re-occupation after the eviction party had left. On 13 June 1814, this was done by burning in the case of Badinloskin, the house occupied by William Chisholm. Accounts vary, but it is possible that his elderly and bedridden mother-in-law was still in the house when it was set on fire. In James Hunter's understanding of events, Sellar ordered her to be immediately carried out as soon as he realised what was happening. The old lady died 6 days later. Eric Richards suggests that the old woman was carried to an outbuilding before the house was destroyed. Whatever the facts of the matter, Sellar was charged with culpable homicide and arson, in respect of this incident and others during this clearance. The charges were brought by Robert Mackid, the Sheriff Depute, driven by the enmity he held for Sellar for catching him poaching. As the trial approached, the Sutherland estate was reluctant to assist Sellar in his defence, distancing themselves from their employee. He was acquitted of all charges at his trial in 1816. The estate were hugely relieved, taking this as a justification of their clearance activity. (Robert Mackid became a ruined man and had to leave the county, providing Sellar with a grovelling letter of apology and confession.) Nevertheless, Sellar and William Young were dismissed and replaced by Francis Suther working under the direction of James Loch. Sellar remained as the tenant of the new sheep farm in Strathnaver, Rhiloisk. A much larger clearance was undertaken in Strathnaver under the factorship of Suther in 1819 involving 236 families (approximately 1,180 people). Loch was anxious to move quickly, whilst cattle prices were high and there was a good demand for leases of sheep farms. After Sellar's trial the estate was concerned about the risk of bad publicity. However, Suther, despite precise instructions to the contrary, used fire to destroy cleared houses. This came after a spell of dry weather, in which the turf and stone walls of the houses had dried out, so that even the turf in the walls ignited, adding to the blaze of the thatch and roof timbers. Multiplied over the large number of properties that were cleared, this made a horrific impression on those who observed it. The public relations disaster that Loch had wished to avoid now followed, with the Observer newspaper running the headline: \\"the Devastation of Sutherland\\". 1819 became known as \\"the year of the burnings\\" (bliadhna na losgaidh) The result of this clearance activity was the transformation of the strath from traditional semi- subsistence agriculture to sheep farming. In later years, the Highland Clearances were re-examined, notably by the Napier Commission, who published their report in 1884. One outcome of this was the creation of the Congested Districts Board (CDB) in 1897, tasked with alleviating the problems of the over-crowded crofting communities created by clearance. This coincided with Patrick Sellar's grandson deciding not to continue with the tenancy in Strathnaver. After protracted negotiations, the CDB were able to buy North Syre in 1901 and lay it out into 29 substantial crofts, creating the present- day landscape. Natural history The River Naver is designated a Special Area of Conservation due to its importance for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and Freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera). At one time there was a significant pearl fishery on both the Naver and Mallart. Notable People *Rev Robert Munro born and raised in Strathnaver. Tourism The river has long enjoyed a reputation as a productive salmon river. The area is now being marketed to non-fishermen as \\"Mackay Country\\". The B873 road runs along the west side of the strath from Altnaharra, alongside Loch Naver, to Syre, from whence the B871 continues to a junction with the A836 a few miles south of Bettyhill. These roads together with an unclassified road running south from the east end of the Invernaver bridge through Skelpick, connect the Strathnaver Trail of historic sites.

Their common name is Andes frogs. They are endemic to Peru and inhabit the upper humid montane forest and supra-treeline grassland in the Cordillera Oriental, with one record from the Peruvian Cordillera Occidental. Taxonomy The contents and phylogenetic position of Phrynopus have long been uncertain, and species once included in this genus have been moved to other genera (Bryophryne, Lynchius, Isodactylus (now Hypodactylus), Noblella, Niceforonia, and Psychrophrynella). Hedges and colleagues placed it in 2008 in Strabomantidae, subfamily Strabomantinae. Most recently, the genus was transferred into Craugastoridae, subfamily Holoadeninae. However, the AmphibiaWeb keeps Noblella in Strabomantidae/Strabomantinae, a family/subfamily no longer recognized by the Amphibian Species of the World. Description Phrynopus are small to medium-sized frogs, from snout‚Äìvent length in Phrynopus auriculatus to in Phrynopus kauneorum. Head is narrower than the body.

An emerging application in modern engineering, it involves the use of robots or other automated systems to analyze air-borne chemicals. Such an apparatus is often called an electronic nose or e-nose. The development of machine olfaction is complicated by the fact that e-nose devices to date have responded to a limited number of chemicals, whereas odors are produced by unique sets of (potentially numerous) odorant compounds. The technology, though still in the early stages of development, promises many applications, such as: quality control in food processing, detection and diagnosis in medicine, detection of drugs, explosives and other dangerous or illegal substances, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. One type of proposed machine olfaction technology is via gas sensor array instruments capable of detecting, identifying, and measuring volatile compounds. However, a critical element in the development of these instruments is pattern analysis, and the successful design of a pattern analysis system for machine olfaction requires a careful consideration of the various issues involved in processing multivariate data: signal-preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, regression, clustering, and validation. Another challenge in current research on machine olfaction is the need to predict or estimate the sensor response to aroma mixtures. Some pattern recognition problems in machine olfaction such as odor classification and odor localization can be solved by using time series kernel methods. Detection There are three basic detection techniques using conductive-polymer odor sensors (polypyrrole), tin-oxide gas sensors, and quartz-crystal micro-balance sensors. They generally comprise (1) an array of sensors of some type, (2) the electronics to interrogate those sensors and produce digital signals, and (3) data processing and user interface software. The entire system is a means of converting complex sensor responses into a qualitative profile of the volatile (or complex mixture of chemical volatiles) that make up a smell, in the form of an output. Conventional electronic noses are not analytical instruments in the classical sense and very few claim to be able to quantify an odor. These instruments are first 'trained' with the target odor and then used to 'recognize' smells so that future samples can be identified as 'good' or 'bad'. Research into alternative pattern recognition methods for chemical sensor arrays has proposed solutions to differentiate between artificial and biological olfaction related to dimensionality. This biologically-inspired approach involves creating unique algorithms for information processing. Electronic noses are able to discriminate between odors and volatiles from a wide range of sources. The list below shows just some of the typical applications for electronic nose technology ‚Äì many are backed by research studies and published technical papers.  Odor localization  Odor localization is a combination of quantitative chemical odor analysis and path- searching algorithms, and environmental conditions play a vital role in localization quality. Different methods are being researched for various purposes and in different real-world conditions. = Motivation = Odor localization is the technique and process of locating a volatile chemical source in an environment containing one or several odors. It is vitally important for all living beings for both finding sustenance and avoiding danger. Unlike the other basic human senses, the sense of smell is entirely chemical-based. However, in comparison with the other dimensions of perception, detection of odor faces additional problems due to the complex dynamic equations of odor and unpredictable external disturbances such as wind. = Application = Odor localization technology shows promise in many applications, including: *quality control in food processing (e.g. taints, bacterial spoilage) *locating the source of dangerous substances (e.g.: explosives and chemical warfare agents) *discovering underground resources or hazards *detecting prohibited materials (e.g.: drug detection) *searching for survivors of natural disasters *environmental monitoring for pollutants *early diagnosis of diseases (e.g. in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) = History and problem statement = The earliest instrument for specific odor detection was a mechanical nose developed in 1961 by Robert Wighton Moncrieff. The first electronic nose was created by W. F. Wilkens and J. D. Hartman in 1964. Larcome and Halsall discussed the use of robots for odor sensing in the nuclear industry in the early 1980s, and research on odor localization was started in the early 1990s. Odor localization is now a fast-growing field. Various sensors have been developed and a variety of algorithms have been proposed for diverse environments and conditions. Mechanical odor localization can be executed via the following three steps, (1) search for the presence of a volatile chemical (2) search for the position of the source with an array of odor sensors and certain algorithms, and (3) identify the tracked odor source (odor recognition). = Localization methods = Odor localization methods are often classified according to odor dispersal modes in a range of environmental conditions. These modes can generally be divided into two categories: diffusion-dominated fluid flow and turbulence-dominated fluid flow. These have different algorithms for odor localization, discussed below.  Diffusion- dominated fluid flow  Tracking and localization methods for diffusion- dominated fluid flow ‚Äì which is mostly used in underground odor localization ‚Äì must be designed so that olfaction machinery can operate in environments in which fluid motion is dominated by viscosity. This means that diffusion leads to the dispersal of odor flow, and the concentration of odor decreases from the source as a Gaussian distribution. The diffusion of chemical vapor through soil without external pressure gradient is often modeled by Fick's second law: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial t} =D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 C}{\\\\partial d^2} where is the diffusion constant, is distance in the diffusion direction, is chemical concentration and is time. Assuming the chemical odor flow only disperses in one direction with a uniform cross-section profile, the relationship of odor concentration at a certain distance and certain time point between odor source concentrations is modeled as : \\\\frac{C}{C_s}=erfc\\\\frac{d}{\\\\sqrt{4Dt}} where C_s is the odor source concentration. This is the simplest dynamic equation in odor detection modeling, ignoring external wind or other interruptions. Under the diffusion-dominated propagation model, different algorithms were developed by simply tracking chemical concentration gradients to locate an odor source. = E. coli algorithm = A simple tracking method is the E. coli algorithm. In this process, the odor sensor simply compares concentration information from different locations. The robot moves along repeated straight lines in random directions. When the current state odor information is improved compared to the previous reading, the robot will continue on the current path. However, when the current state condition is worse than the previous one, the robot will backtrack then move in another random direction. This method is simple and efficient, however, the length of the path is highly variable and misteps increase with proximity to the source. = Hex-path algorithm and dodecahedron algorithm = Another method based on the diffusion model is the hex-path algorithm, developed by R. Andrew Russel for underground chemical odor localization with a buried probe controlled by a robotic manipulator. The probe moves at a certain depth along the edges of a closely packed hexagonal grid. At each state junction , there are two paths (left and right) for choosing, and the robot will take the path that leads to higher concentration of the odor based on the previous two junction states odor concentration information , . In the 3D version of the hex-path algorithm, the dodecahedron algorithm, the probe moves in a path that corresponds to a closely packed dodecahedra, so that at each state point there are three possible path choices.  Turbulence-dominated fluid flow  plume modeling In turbulence-dominated fluid flow, localization methods are designed to deal with background fluid (wind or water) flow as turbulence interruption. Most of the algorithms under this category are based on plume modeling (Figure 1). Plume dynamics are based on Gaussian models, which are based on Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. The simplified boundary condition of the Gaussian-based model is: \\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial t} =D_x\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 C}{\\\\partial x^2}+D_y\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 C}{\\\\partial y^2}+\\\\alpha\\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial x}+\\\\beta\\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial x} where and are diffusion constants; \\\\alpha is the linear wind velocity in the direction, \\\\beta is the linear wind velocity in the direction. Additionally assuming that the environment is uniform and the plume source is constant, the equation for odor detection in each robot sensor at each detection time point is R_i=\\\\gamma_i\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}{\\\\frac{C_k}{\\\\{\\\\rho_k-r_k}\\\\^\\\\alpha}}+\\\\omega_i where R_i is the sample of sensor, \\\\gamma_i is gain factor, C_k is source intensity, \\\\rho_k is the location of source, \\\\alpha is plume attenuation parameter, \\\\omega_i is background noise that satisfies N(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma^2). Under plume modeling, different algorithms can be used to localize the odor source. Figure 2. Triangulation method = Triangulation algorithm = A simple algorithm that can be used for location estimation is the triangulation method (Figure 2). Consider the odor detection equation above, the position of the odor source can be estimated by organizing sensor distances on one side of the equation and ignoring the noise. The source position can be estimated using the following equations: (x_1-x_s)^2+(y_1-y_s)^2=R_1/(\\\\gamma_1C) (x_2-x_s)^2+(y_2-y_s)^2=R_2/(\\\\gamma_2C) (x_3-x_s)^2+(y_3-y_s)^2=R_3/(\\\\gamma_3C) = Least square method (LSM) = The least square method (LSM) is a slightly complicated algorithm for odor localization. The LSM version of the odor tracking model is given by: R_i,_t=\\\\gamma_i{\\\\frac{C}{\\\\{\\\\rho_k- r_i}\\\\^2}}+\\\\omega_i=\\\\gamma_i{\\\\frac{C}{d^2}}+\\\\omega_i where d_i is the Euclidean distance between the sensor node and the plume source, given by: d_i=\\\\sqrt{(x_i-x-s)^2+(y_i+y_s)^2} The main difference between the LSM algorithm and the direct triangulation method is the noise. In LSM, noise is considered, and the odor source location is estimated by minimizing the squared error. The nonlinear least square problem is given by: J=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}({\\\\frac{C}{\\\\sqrt{(x_i-\\\\widehat{x_s})^2(y_i-\\\\widehat{y_s})^2}}-\\\\overline{z_l})} where (\\\\widehat{x_s},\\\\widehat{y_s}) is the estimated source location and \\\\overline{z_l} is the average of multiple measurements at the sensors, given by: \\\\overline{z_l}=\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{i=1}^M{z_i} = Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) = Another method based on plume modeling is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In this odor localization method, several matrices are defined as follows: Z=[\\\\frac{R_1-\\\\mu_1}{\\\\sigma_1}, \\\\frac{R_2-\\\\mu_2}{\\\\sigma_2}, ...\\\\frac{R_N-\\\\mu_N}{\\\\sigma_N}] G=diag[\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1}{\\\\sigma_1}, \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_2}{\\\\sigma_2}, ...\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_N}{\\\\sigma_N}] D=[\\\\frac{1}{d_1^2}, \\\\frac{1}{d_2^2}, ...\\\\frac{1}{d_N^2}] \\\\zeta=[\\\\zeta_1, \\\\zeta_2,...\\\\zeta_N] \\\\zeta_i=(\\\\omega_i-\\\\mu_i)/\\\\sigma_i\\\\sim N(0,1) \\\\frac{R_i-\\\\mu_i}{\\\\sigma_i}\\\\sim N(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_i}{\\\\sigma_i}\\\\frac{C}{d_i^2},1) With these matrices, the plume- based odor detection model can be expressed with the following equation: Z=GDC+\\\\zeta Then the MLE can be applied to the modeling and form the probability density function f(Z,\\\\theta)=2\\\\pi^{-(N/2)}e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}(Z-GDC)^T(Z-GDC)} where \\\\theta is the estimated odor source position, and the log likelihood function is L(\\\\theta)\\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N{\\\\Z_i-\\\\gamma_i\\\\frac{c}{d_i^2}\\\\}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N{(\\\\frac{Ri-\\\\mu_i}{\\\\sigma_i}-\\\\gamma_i\\\\frac{c}{d_i^2})^2} The maximum likelihood parameter estimation of \\\\theta can be calculated by minimizing I(\\\\theta)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N{(\\\\frac{Ri-\\\\mu_i}{\\\\sigma_i}-\\\\gamma_i\\\\frac{c}{d_i^2})^2} and the accurate position of the odor source can be estimated by solving: \\\\frac{\\\\partial{I(\\\\theta)}}{\\\\partial(x)}=0, \\\\frac{\\\\partial{I(\\\\theta)}}{\\\\partial(y)}=0 See also *Digital scent technology *Fido explosives detector *Olfactometer References External links * Electronic Nose Technologies from Scensive Technologies Ltd, UK * T.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Old New Year falls on January 14 in the Gregorian calendar. The same day is celebrated in India as the sun ends its southward journey and starts moving northward: Thai Pongal. This traditional dating of the New Year is sometimes commonly called \\"Orthodox\\" because it harks back to a time when governments in Russia and Eastern Europe used the Julian Calendar, which is still used by some jurisdictions of the Orthodox Church. The Orthodox Church's liturgical year actually begins in September. In Russia Although the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic officially adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1918, the Russian Orthodox Church continued to use the Julian calendar. The New Year became a holiday that is celebrated by both calendars. As in most countries which use the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day in Russia is a public holiday celebrated on January 1. On that day, joyous entertainment, fireworks, elaborate and often large meals and other festivities are common. The holiday is interesting as it combines secular traditions of bringing in the New Year with the Christian Orthodox Christmastide customs, such as kolyada. The New Year by the Julian calendar is still informally observed, and the tradition of celebrating the coming of the New Year twice is widely enjoyed: January 1 (New New Year) and January 14 (Old New Year). Usually not as festive as the New New Year, for many this is a nostalgic family holiday ending the New Year holiday cycle (which includes Eastern Orthodox Christmas on January 7) with traditional large meals, singing and celebratory drinking. In Serbia The Old New Year () is commonly called the Serbian New Year ( / ), and sometimes the Orthodox New Year ( / ) and rarely Julian New Year ( / ). The Serbian Orthodox Church, with traditional adherence in Serbia (including Kosovo), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia, celebrates its feasts and holidays according to the Julian calendar. A part of the population celebrates Serbian New Year in a similar way as the New Year on January 1. This time, usually one concert is organized in front of either City Hall or the National Parliament (in Belgrade), while fireworks are prepared by the Serbian Orthodox Church and fired from the Church of Saint Sava, where people also gather. Other cities also organize such celebrations. Restaurants, clubs, cafes, and hotels are usually fully booked and organize New Year's celebrations with food and live music. A traditional folk name for this holiday as part of Twelve Days of Christmas is Little Christmas ( / ). Some families continue with the procedures of Serbian Christmas traditions. In Macedonia The holiday in Macedonia is known as Old New Year (, ) or as Vasilica (–í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∞, \\"St. Basil\\" (, )). Late on January 13, people gather outside their houses, in the center of their neighborhoods where they start a huge bonfire and drink and eat together. Traditional Macedonian music is sung. For those who stay at home, it is the tradition to eat home-made pita with a coin inside. Whoever finds the coin in their part is said to have luck during the year.http://www.prespanews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=1803:2012-01-12-14-49-31&catid;=44:prespa&Itemid;=107/ Macedonians around the world also celebrate the holiday, especially in Australia, Canada, and the United States where Macedonian Orthodox Church has adherents. Other countries The tradition of the Old New Year has been kept in Kurdistan, Palestine, Jordan, Armenia, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina (mostly in Republika Srpska), Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Montenegro, Moldova, Ukraine (Malanka), Wales (as Hen Galan) and Switzerland (as alter Silvester). In Scotland, the Old New Year has traditionally been held on 12 January. In the first half of the 20th century, large segments of the Scottish Gaelic community still observed the feastThe Last Pibroch, Jaunty Jock and the Ayrshire Idylls by Neil Munro, stated in the glossary; http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2012/jan/09/gaelic-new-year- celebrations and today, it is still marked in South Uist and Eriskay as Oidhche Challaig and as Oidhche Challainn in Glenfinnan. Also in Scotland, the coastal town of Burghead in Morayshire celebrates the eve of the Old New Year with \\"The Burning o' the Clavie\\". Old New Year is the 12th of January in this district as well. The Berbers of North Africa (from Morocco to Libya) traditionally celebrate the New Year on the \\"Berber calendar\\", which is very close to the Julian calendar. Because of certain calendar errors, the \\"Berber New Year\\" is celebrated in some areas on the 12th, rather than 14th, of January.Yannayer, le 12 ou le 14 janvier?, LA D√âP√äCHE DE KABYLIE, 2006-01-15 In art The Old New Year tradition has received mention in Russian art; the playwright Mikhail Roshchin wrote a comedy-drama called The Old New Year in 1973, which was staged for many years.

A young woman named Nina gets bitten and undergoes a transformation into a werewolf during the three nights of the lunar cycle during which the moon is most illuminated (full moon, and the previous and next nights). Angel tries to help Nina, unaware that she is being hunted by an exclusive club which specializes in exotic meals. Plot The gang's meeting in a park is interrupted as a young woman named Nina (Jenny Mollen) is attacked and bitten by a werewolf. The woman runs off before Angel kills the werewolf. At Wolfram & Hart the next day, Gunn notes that there are two more nights in which the woman will transform into a new werewolf. They need to find the woman, since she will not know what happened to her. Spike pays Fred a visit, asking her to consider his condition a priority over the woman from the park. He tells her that his disappearances \\"to the netherworld\\" are lasting longer. Fred suggests that Spike let Wesley help him, but Spike says that he and Wesley have a history. Fred does not believe him, so Spike admits that he just does not want anyone else to know what he is going through. Fred assures him that they will figure things out. At her home, Nina wakes from a restless sleep and heads to the kitchen, where her sister Jill and niece Amanda are cooking. Nina discovers that her hearing is improved and she does not remember the bruise on her neck. She studies hamburgers cooking on the stove and imagines slashing Amanda's neck. At the science lab, the gang tracks down Nina's address. That night, Nina baby-sits Amanda; she starts feeling sick and goes upstairs, where she begins turning into a werewolf. Angel pulls Nina through her bedroom window and Wesley tranquilizes her. The next day, Nina wakes up naked in a cell. Angel tries to tell her that she is safe, and shows her a video of herself as a wolf in the cell the night before. She is upset with her condition and the fact that she wanted to hurt Amanda. He tries to tell her that it was the monster inside her that caused the violent impulses, and tells her that she can control herself - he does it every day. Nina asks if he can cure her and Angel admits that he can not, but says he can protect her. Angel meets with Fred and Royce, telling them Nina agreed to stay in the holding cell that night. Royce warns that Nina might hurt herself, but she might be okay if they take her back to her place; the familiarity will calm her. Angel agrees to let Nina go home; Fred and Nina head to Nina's place. Fred tries to tell her that her life does not have to change too much, since she is only a werewolf three nights out of the month. As Fred and Nina are about to enter Nina's house, Nina says that she is not ready to face Jill and Amanda yet. Inside, Fred introduces herself and makes up a story about Nina leaving because Fred needed her help. Nina and Jill fight and Nina leaves while Fred grabs some things for her. They head back to the van they came in, but Fred notices that the door is open, then sees that the security guards are dead. She tells Nina to run before a man knocks her out and kidnaps Nina. Nina is taken to the basement of a mansion and chained up, and a matronly woman cuts off her clothes and washes her. At Wolfram & Hart, Royce sings \\"Jessie's Girl\\" for Lorne, who confirms that he is clean. In Angel's office, the others try to figure out who might have grabbed Nina. Fred criticizes herself for going near the van when it was obvious that something was wrong; she also worries that Spike has not materialized for a while. As Royce arrives, Fred spots Spike in the hallway and goes to talk with him. She tries to follow him, but he does not seem to hear her. She winds up in an office and sees something in a trash can, but is interrupted by Royce. Fred babbles for a little while, then knocks Royce out with a lamp. Fred found a vial in Royce's trash that contained Calendula; Royce suspected that he would have to sing for Lorne, so he took a drug that would make him appear clean. Gunn discovers that Royce's desk holds photos, papers and a knife. Angel interrogates Royce for Nina's location as Fred shows the others her discovery, a menu for a banquet hosted by restaurant entrepreneur John Crane, whose employees abducted Nina after Royce informed him of her availability. Crane has rapidly assembled several like-minded gourmets willing to pay top dollar to dine on werewolf meat. At moonrise, in about 15 minutes, Nina, chained to a serving platter, will be the main course. The gang heads to the banquet hall and Angel starts to rescue Nina, who tells him to let her get eaten. She does not think that she can go home and is resigned to being an animal. Angel frees her anyway, but before the gang can leave, they are surrounded by men with guns. As a confrontation begins Nina turns into a werewolf, providing some unexpected help to the group before Wesley tranquilizes her. Angel announces that they are leaving, but Crane declares that he promised his guests a werewolf. Werewolf Nina bites Royce's leg, and Angel points out that in a month, Crane will have another werewolf to eat: Royce, in whose welfare Angel has no interest. Crane considers this an acceptable resolution for both groups, although Royce is understandably less enthusiastic. Fred returns to her office to find Spike. He tells her that he was not sure he would return from the netherworld this time. She wants to tell Angel what is going on with him, but Spike refuses. Fred tells him that she will find a way to keep him in the world. Angel drives Nina home as she asks how he can live with knowing that he has killed people. Angel tells her that eventually she will accept being a werewolf. She does not want to tell Jill and Amanda and Angel says that she does not have to, but she can if she wants to. The gang meet up in Angel's apartment and order Chinese food again, which Angel offers to buy, shocking the others. Gunn wonders if Angel has a shot with Nina; Angel says that she gave him \\"a look\\". The gang settle in to spend a laid back evening together. Production Producer Jeffrey Bell says, \\"Nina is not becoming a regular, but there was good chemistry so we‚Äôve talked about bringing her back. There are no master plans for Angel and werewolf girl but we‚Äôre always open to the possibility.\\" The werewolves were designed by Robert Hall, of special effects agency Almost Human, and were an intentional departure from the werewolf costume worn by Oz's character on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. \\"They were saying Oz looked like a gay possum,\\" Hall says. He decided to design the werewolf with sparse hair so that the muscles underneath were clearly visible. \\"The script wanted a big, bad wolf,\\" he explains. \\"I think it literally said, 'Don't make it look like a gay possum.'\\" References External links * * Category:Angel (season 5) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about werewolves ","title":"Unleashed (Angel)"},{"id":"3659597","text":"A vodka martini \\"Shaken, not stirred\\" is a catchphrase of Ian Fleming's fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond and describes his preference for the preparation of his martini cocktail. The phrase first appears in the novel Diamonds Are Forever (1956), though Bond himself does not actually say it until Dr. No (1958), where his exact words are \\"shaken and not stirred.\\" In the film adaptations of Fleming's novels, the phrase is first uttered by the villain, Dr. Julius No, when he offers the drink in Dr. No (1962), and it is not uttered by Bond himself (played by Sean Connery) until Goldfinger (1964). It is used in numerous Bond films thereafter with the notable exceptions of You Only Live Twice (1967), in which the drink is wrongly offered as \\"stirred, not shaken\\", to Bond's response \\"Perfect\\", and Casino Royale (2006) in which Bond, after losing millions of dollars in a game of poker, is asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred and snaps, \\"Do I look like I give a damn?\\" Variations in the Bond novels and films =Novels= The earliest form of the \\"shaken, not stirred\\" motif appears in the first Bond novel, Casino Royale (1953). After meeting his CIA contact Felix Leiter for the first time, Bond orders a drink from a barman while at the casino. The drink will later be referred to as a \\"Vesper\\", after the original Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. A Vesper differs from Bond's usual cocktail of choice, the martini, in that it uses both gin and vodka, Kina Lillet instead of vermouth, and lemon peel instead of an olive. In the same scene Bond gives more details about the Vesper, telling the same barman that vodka made from grain instead of potatoes makes the drink even better. Kina Lillet is no longer available, but can be approximatedCourtesy of Allessandro Pallazi of Duke's Hotel in London by using the sweeter Lillet Blanc along with a dash of Angostura Bitters. Another Kina (or quinine) apertif which has the bite and approximate flavour is Cocchi Americano. Russian and Polish vodkas were also always preferred by Bond if they were in stock. Although there is a lot of discussion on the Vesper, it is only ordered once throughout Fleming's novels and by later books Bond is ordering regular vodka martinis, though he also drinks regular gin martinis. In total, Bond orders 19 vodka martinis and 16 gin martinis throughout Fleming's novels and short stories. =Film= The American Film Institute honoured Goldfinger and the phrase on 21 July 2005 by ranking it #90 on a list of best movie quotes in the past 100 years of film. Sean Connery The shaken Martini is mentioned twice in the first Bond film Dr. No (1962). When Bond has presumably ordered a drink from room service to his hotel room, it is mixed by a waiter, who says \\"one medium dry vodka martini mixed like you said, sir, but not stirred.\\" (A slice of lime was in the bottom of the glass.) Later, Dr. No presents Bond with a drink ‚Äì \\"A medium dry martini, lemon peel. Shaken, not stirred.\\" Bond did not vocally order one himself until Goldfinger (1964). In the 1967 film You Only Live Twice, Bond's contact Henderson prepares a martini for Bond and says, \\"That's, um, stirred not shaken. That was right, wasn't it?\\" To which Bond replies politely, \\"Perfect.\\" George Lazenby In George Lazenby's only film as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond never actually orders himself a drink, but when he meets Marc- Ange Draco for the first time, Draco tells his assistant, Olympe, to get a dry martini for Bond. Draco then adds, \\"Shaken, not stirred.\\" Roger Moore Roger Moore's Bond never actually ordered one himself, but has one ordered for him several times, nonetheless. In the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me, Anya Amasova orders him one. In Moonraker, his drink is prepared by Manuela. In Octopussy, the title character (Maud Adams) herself greets Bond by mixing his drink. Timothy Dalton Timothy Dalton's Bond ordered his trademark Martini in each of his films. In The Living Daylights he and Kara arrive in Austria where he orders a martini \\"Shaken, not stirred\\" shortly after entering their hotel. For his second film, Licence to Kill he doesn't directly order it. Instead, he tells Pam Bouvier what drink he'd like as he plays Blackjack, only to end up disappearing shortly after, leaving Bouvier to down the entire martini in one long gulp ‚Äî much to her disgust. Pierce Brosnan In GoldenEye, Bond orders the drink in a casino while talking with Xenia Onatopp, and later, Zukovsky refers to Bond as a \\"charming, sophisticated secret agent. Shaken, but not stirred.\\" In Tomorrow Never Dies, Paris Carver orders the drink for Bond after the two meet again after years apart. While Paris' choice of drink had changed, Bond's had not. In The World Is Not Enough, Bond orders the drink in Zukovsky's casino. In Die Another Day, Bond is coming back on a rather turbulent British Airways flight. The air hostess (played by Roger Moore's daughter Deborah) serves him his martini, to which Bond replies, \\"Luckily I asked for it shaken\\". Later in the film, when Bond travels to Gustav Graves' ice palace in Iceland, he orders another martini, sarcastically telling the bartender \\"Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.\\" Daniel Craig The Vesper was reused in the 2006 film version of Casino Royale, while Bond is playing poker to defeat Le Chiffre. Daniel Craig's Bond ordered the drink, providing great detail about how it should be prepared. The other poker players order the Vesper as well, with Felix Leiter telling the bartender to \\"Keep the fruit\\" with his. Later, after Bond loses money to Le Chiffre, he orders another martini, but when the barman asks whether he would like it shaken or stirred, Bond snaps, \\"Do I look like I give a damn?\\" In Quantum of Solace, the bartender on an aeroplane gives the precise recipe for the Vesper from Fleming's novel Casino Royale, which was a minor anachronism, since Kina Lillet was reformulated (removing the Kina) in 1986, 22 years before the film's production. Bond is purported to have drunk six of them. In Skyfall, when talking to Bond girl S√©v√©rine at a casino bar, the bartender is seen shaking Bond's martini before pouring it, to which Bond comments \\"perfect\\". In Spectre, Bond orders his signature drink in a mountaintop resort, only to be told to his disdain that he is at a health clinic and that the bar does not serve alcohol. Q instead orders Bond an unpleasant-looking green-coloured \\"prolytic digestive enzyme shake\\", and a disgusted Bond asks the barman \\"Do me a favour, will you? Throw that down the toilet. Cut out the middleman.\\" Purpose of shaking Cocktail shaker Biochemists and martini connoisseurs have investigated the difference between a martini shaken and a martini stirred. The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Western Ontario in Canada studied whether preparation of a martini affects its antioxidant capacity; the study found that the shaken gin martinis were able to break down hydrogen peroxide and leave only 0.072% of the peroxide, while the stirred gin martini left 0.157%. Thus a shaken martini has more antioxidants than a stirred one. Andrew Lycett, an Ian Fleming biographer, believed that Fleming liked his martinis shaken, not stirred, because Fleming thought that stirring a drink diminished its flavour. Lycett also noted that Fleming preferred gin and vermouth for his martini. Fleming was a fan of martinis shaken by Hans Schr√∂der, a German bartender. Harry Craddock's Savoy Cocktail Book (1930) prescribes shaking for all its martini recipes. However, many bartenders stir any cocktail whose ingredients are all transparent‚Äîsuch as martinis, manhattans, and negronis‚Äîto maintain clarity and texture. Shaking a drink introduces air bubbles into the mixture and can chip off small pieces from the ice cubes when they hit each other or the wall of the shaker. Both of these factors lead to a cloudy appearance and a different texture compared with a stirred drink. However, when any ingredients are opaque (such as citrus juices, dairy, or eggs), changes in clarity and texture are less important. Both shaking and stirring a drink with ice serve to chill and dilute the drink. Both techniques are equally effective, but shaking is much faster. Bartenders do not stir long enough to reach the matching temperature and dilution. Some connoisseurs believe that shaking gin \\"bruises\\" the gin (gives it a slight bitter taste). Fleming's novel Casino Royale states that Bond \\"watched as the deep glass became frosted with the pale golden drink, slightly aerated by the bruising of the shaker,\\" suggesting that Bond was requesting it shaken because of the vodka it contained. Prior to the 1960s, vodka was, for the most part, refined from potatoes (usually cheaper brands). This element made the vodka oily. To disperse the oil, Bond ordered his martinis shaken; thus, in the same scene where he orders the martini, he tells the barman about how vodka made from grain rather than potatoes makes his drink even better. Shaking is also said to dissolve the vermouth better, making it less oily tasting. While properly called a Bradford, a shaken martini also appears cloudier than when stirred. This is caused by the small fragments of ice present in a shaken martini. This also brings into question the movie versions, which are never cloudy. In \\"Stirred,\\" an episode of The West Wing, President Josiah Bartlet disagrees with Bond in a conversation with his aide Charlie Young: \\"Shaken, not stirred, will get you cold water with a dash of gin and dry vermouth. The reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a weak martini and being snooty about it.\\"\\"The West Wing\\" Stirred (2002) - Memorable quotes. Other 007 drinking habits A general study of Bond‚Äôs consumption of alcohol in the series of novels by Fleming was published by three scientists. =Spirits= Bond's drinking habits mirror those of his creator, Ian Fleming. Fleming, as well as Bond throughout the novels, had a preference for bourbon whiskey. Fleming himself had a fondness for gin, drinking as much as a bottle a day; however, he was converted to bourbon at the behest of his doctor who informed him of his failing health. Otherwise, in the films James Bond normally has a fondness for vodka that is accompanied by product placement for a brand. For instance, Smirnoff was clearly shown in 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, in which Bond sits drinking a bottle while in his hotel room in Hamburg. Other brands featured in the films have included Absolut Vodka, Stolichnaya and Finlandia. In the film GoldenEye, Bond suggests cognac when offered a drink by M, who gives him bourbon instead, as it is her preference. The whiskey poured is in fact Jack Daniel's, which markets itself as a Tennessee Whiskey, which is legally a sub- category of bourbon ‚Äì often distinguished from bourbon itself. In Goldfinger, Bond drinks a mint julep at Auric Goldfinger's Kentucky stud farm, and in Thunderball, Largo gives Bond a Rum Collins. Bond is also seen in Quantum of Solace drinking bottled beer when meeting with Felix Leiter in a Bolivian bar. In Die Another Day, Bond drinks a mojito. In Casino Royale, Bond orders Mount Gay Rum with soda. In that film, he also invents the famous \\"Vesper\\" cocktail‚Äîa variation on a martini‚Äîoriginally included in the novel but not seen in the films until the reboot. In Skyfall, the villain Raoul Silva says he believes 50-year-old Macallan single malt whisky to be one of Bond's favourites. Also in Goldfinger during a briefing on the villain, their host offers a refill with, \\"Have a little more of this rather disappointing brandy.\\" M replies, \\"Why, what is the matter with it?\\" Bond replies, \\"I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine [as in Fine brandy] indifferently blended, Sir... with an overdose of Bon bois.\\" Bon bois is a Cognac region known for its poor soils. It is a low quality Cognac, and Bond is saying that too much of this was used in the blend. In the novel Moonraker, it is noted in the card club Blades, Bond adds a single pinch of black pepper to his glass of fine Wolfschmidt vodka, much to M's consternation, to which Bond says he got into the habit in joints that served villainous home brew. It sinks all the poisons to the bottom, and Bond got to like the taste. However, he does admit that he should not have insulted the Club Wolfschmidt. =Wines= In several of the Bond films, he is known to prefer Bollinger and Dom P√©rignon champagne. Never primarily a red wine drinker, Bond tended to favour Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild; a 1947 vintage in Goldfinger, and half a bottle On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a 1934 ordered by M in Moonraker, and a '55 in Diamonds are Forever‚Äîwhere Bond unveiled the assassin Wint posing as a waiter because the latter didn't know that Mouton-Rothschild is a claret. In the Jeffery Deaver novel Carte Blanche, Bond expresses a knowledge and appreciation of South African wine. In the film of Diamonds Are Forever, Bond savours a glass of sherry and fools M into thinking Bond has made a mistake when he pronounces a year of make (\\"'51\\"). When Bond is informed that sherry has no vintage, he replies (to a non-plussed M) that he was discerning the vintage of the wine on which the sherry is based ‚Äì 1851. =Others= In the film You Only Live Twice, Bond opts for sake over his usual martini, indicating that he especially likes it when it's served at what he says is the correct temperature of . Tiger, his host, is impressed and tells Bond he is exceptionally cultured‚Äîfor a European. In Licence to Kill when in the dive bar called Barrelhead Bar, he orders the same as his contact, Pam Bouvier, a \\"Bud with a lime.\\" Aside from alcoholic beverages, Bond is a coffee drinker and eschews tea with a passion, believing it to have been a factor in the fall of the British Empire and referring to it as \\"a cup of mud\\" (in Fleming's Goldfinger). In the novel Live and Let Die, he expresses his fondness for Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee ‚Äì while in the film adaptation he is shown operating a La Pavoni Europiccola lever coffee machine in the kitchen of his flat. In the Fleming novel of From Russia With Love he is shown to own a Chemex Coffeemaker and prefers his coffee brewed that way, while in the film version he orders coffee \\"very black\\" for breakfast from his hotel's room service; in Kerim Bey's office he asks for his coffee \\"medium sweet\\" when offered. He also accepts a cup, refusing cream or sugar, from Franz Sanchez in Licence to Kill ‚Äì whereas in Moonraker he refuses a cup of tea offered by Hugo Drax. In The Living Daylights, Bond tastes a cup of caf√© coffee he is served in the Prater Amusement Park, Vienna, making a face when it is not up to his standards.

It is France's first radio station that broadcasts deep house and electro house music (originally electronic and underground music). The station's current playlist is house, dance, R&B; and electronica alongside several American hip-hop songs broadcast from time to time.  History  Radio FG was founded in 1981 as a community radio rooted in the Parisian gay scene and in support of the gay community. The 'FG' initials were said to vary in meaning from \\"Fr√©quence Gaie\\" (Cheerful Frequency) to \\"Futur G√©n√©ration\\" (Future Generation) to \\"Filles et Gar√ßons\\" (Girls and Boys). During its initial four years of broadcasting, the station faced financial struggles as well as internal conflicts, but managed to survive. As time went by, the station, facing an identity crisis, distanced itself from its social activism and re-defined itself as a dedicated electronic music station. In 2001 Radio FG abandoned its community radio status to become a private radio station. In September 2003 Radio FG became known as FG DJ Radio and broadened its spectrum of music to include R'n'B and Ra√Ø music. Mixshows (known as Club FG for most of the time) originally accounted for 30-50 percent of the entire broadcast week. It now only accounts for 10 percent. Today, the station broadcasts throughout the Parisian suburbs and in other major cities around France. In September 2004 the radio started a free webradio service called Underground FG. The station devotes 24 hours a day a mix of house, techno and dance music (similar to the original Radio FG), alongside older mixes that already aired on Radio FG. The website now offers 7 different live streams: FG DeepDance, FG Undrgrnd, Club FG, FG Remix, FG House Chic, and FG Dance by Hakimakli; along with a 6-hour-delayed stream of its main station called FG +6H targeted to its North American audience. There's also a version of the regular FG DJ Radio for Belgium now: Radio FG Belgique. Formerly streams are Vintage FG (which was playing classics) and Energy Burnmix FG. In about February 2017, Radio FG decided to replace non-stop overnight music (Monday ‚Äì Thursday mornings 2 am ‚Äì 5 am) by non-stop rebroadcasts of interviews airing on the drivetime show \\"Happy Hour FG\\" with Antoine Baduel. The reason for this change is still unknown, but it could be necessary to save money, especially because Mediametrie doesn't look a lot after the midnight-5 am slot. This raises concerns for the station's listeners, especially Radio FG is an electronic music station. However, Radio FG is not the first music station have to do so. NRJ (France's main top 40 station) also (until today) carries a mostly-speech output from 8 pm to 6 am (Guillaume Radio 2.0, MiKL, Le PreMorning), and Fun Radio, another electronic station, plays far less music from 8 pm to midnight every weeknight (Lovin'Fun and Le Night Show).

Their official status as refugees is highly disputed, and they have been subject to racial discrimination and police violence. They live among a much larger population of Sudanese migrants in Egypt, more than two million people of Sudanese nationality (by most estimates; a full range is 750,000 to 4 million (FMRS 2006:5) who live in Egypt. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants believes many more of these migrants are in fact refugees, but see little benefit in seeking recognition. Egypt employs a \\"shoot to stop\\" policy against refugees attempting to continue to Israel. According to Human Rights Watch, over 50 refugees, including women and children, have been shot by Egyptian border guards since 2007.Human Rights Watch faults Egypt's 'shoot-to- stop' policy, Christian Science Monitor 13-11-2008Refugees set their sights on Israel , The National 11-12-2009 Background An IDP camp in Darfur. The violent destabilization and economic collapse caused by the immense amount of death and destruction in Sudan has forced millions of civilians to flee their homes and cities. Many refugees currently residing in Egypt escaped from the Second Sudanese Civil War, where war \\"pitted black African separatists\\" and \\"Christians\\" against an \\"Arab government run by Muslim, northerners who had tried to impose Islamic law on the country.\\" 1 in 5 Sudanese were killed in the war, and over 4 million civilians in the South have been given Internally Displaced Persons status. The majority of these IDPs are attempting to resettle outside of the country, but efforts have produced minimal results. Legal status and conflicts Almost one quarter of the refugees report that their experience with the UNHCR was their worst stressor since armed conflicts in Sudan. Although Egypt is a founding signatory to both the 1951 Refugee Convention and the OAU Refugee Convention, the Egyptian government's lack of implementation and numerous conditions entered into the 1951 Convention substantially limit the rights of refugees in Egypt. Throughout history, large numbers of Sudanese have lived in Egypt for long periods of time, often going back and forth between Egypt and Sudan. Since the 1983 war in southern Sudan, followed by the 1989 coup, Egypt has become the preferred place of refuge for Sudanese. Before 1995, the Wadi El Nil agreement between Sudan and Egypt, gave Sudanese unrestricted access to education, health services, property ownership, and employment. However, with the assassination attempt on President Mubarak in Addis Abba in June 1995, allegedly performed by Sudanese Islamists, the Wadi El Nil agreement was abrogated, putting the rights of the Sudanese on par with any other foreigner. Because of the Egyptian government's unwilling to implement the appropriate procedures for refugee status determination due to institutional and financial, as well as political reasons, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began screening Sudanese applications for refugee status in 1995. Due to Egypt's high unemployment rate and overall weak economic condition, domestic popular opinion is generally against permitting rights to Sudanese refugees (education, employment, property, etc.) because of the potential strain on the country's resources and infrastructure. As for the perspective from Egypt's national interests, to offer official refugee status to the Sudanese would indirectly censure the Sudanese government. Additionally, unlike Sudanese refugees, Palestinian refugees are not treated as typical asylum seekers that require a status determination process because of the sentiment of Arab solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Since 1997, the increasing numbers of Sudanese refugees and insufficient living conditions of Egypt lead to greater focus on resettlement to third countries, usually Australia, Canada, the U.S. or Finland. Out of the 67,000 Sudanese who claimed refugee status from the UNHCR office between 1997-March 2004, only about 20,700 were recognized. Of those recognized, UNHCR resettled over 14,300 people . Private sponsorships in addition to family reunification programs administered by the Australian and Canadian embassies have resettled an additional few thousand more. UNHCR‚Äôs office in Cairo has a past of using a very limited interpretation of the refugee definition outlined in the 1951 Refugee Convention. Although most of the Sudanese in Egypt fled due to war and violence, many were rejected refugee status because they were unable to prove a ‚Äúwell founded fear of persecution‚Äù. Thus, between 1999-2003 only 33% of the Sudanese applying for refugee status in Egypt were recognized. Since 2003, the percentage of Sudanese granted refugee status climbed substantially to about 60-63% as a result of UNHCR's expanded interpretation of the refugee definition in accordance with the OAU Convention. The lack of refugee status and illegality results in the lack of employment access, education for children, health services, freedom of movement, and inability to claim justice. As a recognized refugee, an individual receives international protection guaranteed by the host government and UNHCR mainly in the form of protection against expulsion and arrest: In January 2004, Egyptian politicians wrote legislation for a ‚ÄúFour Freedoms Agreement,‚Äù which would grant both Sudanese and Egyptians the freedom of movement, residence, ownership and work in either country. It would allow Sudanese nationals to enter Egypt without a visa to live indefinitely in Egypt without any special permits and no longer have to seek refugee status to remain in the country. The agreement would not enable Sudanese refugees to benefit from educational, medical, or social benefits entitled to native citizens. However, as of 2009, the agreement has yet to be ratified by the Egyptian government. In light of the January 2011 referendum in which South Sudan voted overwhelmingly for independence, UNHCR has already begun creating contingency plans for a possible influx of Sudanese refugees in Egypt. Egyptian officials are expecting an increase of Sudanese refugees into Egypt as there are over one million Southern Sudanese residing in north Sudan, and the country's split could result in a mass departure from Khartoum. Nevertheless, Egypt's poor track record of treatment toward Sudanese refugees makes it difficult to imagine the proper accommodation of a massive influx in the wake of possible post-referendum violence in Sudan. With regards to Egyptian citizenship, refugees are barred from acquiring citizenship as Egyptian nationality is granted only on the basis of descent, or ius sanguinis. This precludes the full integration of refugees in Egypt even for children of refugees born in Egypt. Conditions in Egypt Refugees in Egypt experience discrimination by both the government and civilian services. A series of laws passed by parliament has effectively stalled legal and financial gains for refugees of all nationalities, and the response by the international community has been limited. =Employment= Legal employment in Egypt is \\"virtually\\" impossible for Sudanese refugees. Refugees‚Äô right to work is determined by Egypt's domestic legislation dealing with the employment of foreigners, law no. 137 of 1981, which decrees that refugees must apply for a work permit on par with any other foreigner. Article 53 in the Egyptian Constitution gives the right of asylum to political refugees, however, only the few most prominent have been able to take advantage of this right like the Shah of Iran, Jaafar Nimeiri of Sudan, and the wife of the last king of Libya. The 2003 Labor Law and its implementing Ministerial Decree and the 2004 Decree of the Ministry of Manpower and Emigration force all foreigners including refugees to have a permit to work in \\"gainful\\" employment. The requirements are reportedly very \\"stringent,\\" and include assessments of legal status, employer sponsorship, and non-competition with nationals. In 2006, employers have since been required to submit a certificate verifying Sudanese nationals are not carrying AIDS. As a result of these requirements, only a fraction of Sudanese have obtained working permits.http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,SDN,,4a40d2a5c,0.html UNHRC For Sudanese, the cost of a work permit is about $40; however, they must prove they are uniquely qualified in order to get a work permit. =Housing= Cairo, Egypt. The large influx of Sudanese refugees in Egypt beginning in the late 1990s led to an increase in rent prices and a higher cost of living for refugees as well as social tensions between the natives and Sudanese not experienced during the past influxes in the 1980s. The increased rent prices burdened the Sudanese refugees particularly because they must pay for more expensive furnished flats, unlike natives who have the right to own property. Many refugees unable to afford the rent prices in Cairo live in the dismal conditions of Cairo's destitute neighborhoods or in impoverished areas on the outskirts of the city. Refugee families also tend to share apartments to defray the cost of rent but the overcrowding and frequent visits of family members, which is common in Sudanese culture, has sometimes led to tension between Sudanese tenants and their Egyptian landlords. Moreover, single women and mothers tend to face discrimination when seeking housing since many Egyptian landlords prefer renting to two-parent households due to social stigma. =Support agencies= The main agency is Caritas Egypt, which is responsible for assessing the needs of refugees and providing cash assistance, which is approximately 700 EGP every two months for a maximum of six months. Africa and Middle East Refugee Assistance provides legal aid and psychosocial services. Education Sudanese refugees endure a number of social, economic and political challenges in accessing education. The most acutely affected are those not recognized as refugees. Yet even for those registered with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), exercising their right to education is often impossible.Nelson Moro, Leben. \\"Refugee Education in a Changing Global Climate: The Case of Sudanese in Egypt\\" (Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Comparative and International Education Society in Orland, FL, March 2002) p.2 Retrieved 04/07/11 A 2001 UNHCR case study highlighted concerns that UNHCR funding allocated for education was too low. Rather than being 'geared towards subsidising the status quo', the author advised that it should be 'geared towards fostering refugees' capacity to run their own lives'.Sperl, Stefan. \\"Evaluation of the UNHCR's policy on refugees in urban areas: A Case Study Review of Cairo\\". June 2001. (125) The report also called for all children to have access to public primary schools, as well as providing support and assistance obtaining secondary and postsecondary education through scholarships for students and grants to churches with learning centers. Special attention was to be paid to integrating those children who had been out of education for several years. But this seems to have yielded little results because there was no modality put in place to follow up with the project. As the matter of facts 75% of the Sudanese kids have no access to basic education and this explain why there is a recent rise in gangsterism of Sudanese youths in Egypt's capital Cairo. Sperl, Stefan. \\"Evaluation of the UNHCR's policy on refugees in urban areas: A Case Study Review of Cairo\\". June 2001 (127) Almost ten years later in 2010, the UNHCR provided 7,000 education grants for registered refugees in Egypt‚Äîa relatively low number considering Egypt's burgeoning refugee population, of which the majority is Sudanese.UNHCR Country Operations Profile for Egypt 2011 (http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e486356). =Legal framework= Egypt is party to a number of international conventions, including the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Casablanca Protocol (signed in 1981), and the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Egypt acceded to the 1951 Convention in 1981 with a number of reservations. There are also bilateral agreements between the Egyptian and Sudanese governments, including the 1974 Nile Valley Agreement and the 2004 Four Freedoms Agreement and the 1974 Nile Valley Agreement, permitting free movement of goods and people across the border.Segal, Uma Anand and Elliott, Doreen and Sada Mayadas, Nazneen. Immigration Worldwide: Policies, Practices and Trends. Oxford University Press, 2010. p. 330 These commitments on paper have failed to translate into affording refugees sufficient protection or access to rights, including education. Until recently, one of the reservations to the 1951 Convention referred to Article (22), which stipulated that refugees should receive the same treatment as nationals in accessing primary education.Afifi, Wesal in Stefan, Elisabeth. \\"Education for Refugee Children in Cairo and Role of the Adoption of the Sudanese Curriculum\\". (Malmo University, 2010) p. 32 In December 2000, the government passed a decree permitting recognized refugee children to enter public primary schools.Kani Edward, Jane. Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. P. 104 Currently, the reality is that bureaucratic and social obstacles, ignorance and confusion over ministerial decrees deny Sudanese refugee and non-refugee children alike of their right to access education.Harrell-Bond, Barbara; El-Hilaly, Aya; Schaeffer, Abigail. \\"Refugee Children in Cairo: An Invisible 'at Risk' Group in the City\\". American University in Cairo, 2003. p. 4 The role and procedures used by the UNHCR in determining the status of refugees in Egypt has been the source of occasional criticism from lawyers and refugee rights activists, notably Barbara Harrell- Bond and Michael Kagan. =Public schools= The Egyptian population has a 66% literacy ratehttps://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/newfunct/pdf/background_edu_paper_for_uploading_8_dec.pdf , which is an indication of its overburdened and inadequate education system. In the past, it has suffered criticism for its emphasis on memorization and an inadequate national curriculum.Sperl, Stefan. \\"Evaluation of the UNHCR's policy on refugees in urban areas: A Case Study Review of Cairo\\". June 2001 Schools suffer from overcrowding, which makes finding a place in the appropriate grade in public schools difficult for both Egyptian and Sudanese children.Grabksa, Katarzyna. \\"Who Asked Them Anyway? Rights, Policies and Wellbeing of Refugees in Egypt\\". American University in Cairo, 2006. p. 15 Some schools operate shift systems, in order to accommodate a surplus of students, but in many schools the student-teacher ratio is 45 to 1, with even higher ratios in some inner-city schools.Nelson Moro, Leben. \\"Refugee Education in a Changing Global Climate: The Case of Sudanese in Egypt\\" (Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Comparative and International Education Society in Orland, FL, March 2002) p. 11 Although Sudanese children were granted the right to free primary education in 2000, the cumbersome entry process for Sudanese children hinders access to public schools. The Egyptian Ministry of Education requires that Sudanese provide documentation from previous schools, a birth certificate and residency permit or iqama. Residency permits are often too expensive for Sudanese families, and having spent their lives as IDPs in Sudan, many children do not have the necessary documentation. For those children who are able to attend public primary schools, some are subject to bullying and harassment because of skin colour. There are also problems for many, due to their socio-economic situation. Teachers have noted that some children are unable to do their homework due to cramped living conditions and/or a lack of electricity at home.Kani Edward, Jane. Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. P. 106 Moreover, many Sudanese families live in small one-room apartments, with as many as seven or eight people in one residence.The Sudanese Community Development Program. http://www.scdp-egypt.com/ (Retrieved on 04/09/2011) Recently, the Danish embassy began funding a lunch program, as there was concern that children were coming to school hungry, without having been fed at home.Kani Edward, Jane. Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. P. 123 Secondary education is not free for Sudanese refugees. Like foreigners, they must pay fees.Kani Edward, Jane. Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. P. 107 =Refugee schools= The first refugee school was established in 1990 by Sudanese parents and teachers, (Retrieved 17/04/2011) and since then churches have become major service-providers for the Sudanese refugee population, particarly in the field of education. After recognizing the difficulties Sudanese children faced in accessing free education, many churches established refugee schools.Kani Edward, Jane. Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. P. 122 There are three major learning centers for Sudanese refugees in Cairo providing primary education from kindergarten to tenth grade; namely Muwanga, Nusiriya and Afendiya, as well as several other smaller schools across the city. Muwanga and Nusiriya schools abides by the Egyptian national curriculum, whereas Afendiya follows an American curriculum and teaches lessons in English. These refugee schools face similar problems to public schools in terms of overcrowding. In recent years, Muwanga school has seen its student body increase from 400 to 5000 students. Once again, socio- economic conditions prevent many students from entering refugee schools. According to James Natale Finji, a principal of one of the schools, many of his students live in female-headed households, and most of the single mothers work as domestic servants, sometimes in distant cities, or they live in their employers' homes in Cairo. Their daughters sometimes drop out of school to care for their siblings. (Retrieved on 04/17/2011) Despite their popularity, Sudanese children attending these schools cannot obtain certificates recognized by the Egyptian or Sudanese governments. Rather, children must sit a final examination in Egyptian public schools, set by the Ministry of Education. The registration process for these end of term examinations is problematic for Sudanese refugees, as it requires the submission of documentation and identification, as well as the expense of a residency permit or iqama. As a result, many Sudanese children cannot advance beyond primary level education. According to Sudanese sociologist, Jane Kani Edward, this requirement \\"...represents a planned and constructed strategy to deny southern Sudanese refugee children access to education and success.‚ÄùKani Edward, Jane. Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. P. 105 =Childcare= Sudanese women in Cairo, particularly single mothers, are under pressure to work long hours in the informal economy as domestic workers. In some situations, children are forced to travel to school unaccompanied. Lack of childcare has also forced single mothers to leave their young children at home alone for hours at a time. Others have resorted to enrolling their children in refugee schools, despite being underage. This also poses problems for school teachers, who are faced with large classes of children of various ages and abilities. =Higher Education= There is a relatively long history of higher education among Sudanese in Egypt, dating back to 1972. Following the Addis Ababa Peace Agreement between the Egyptian government and the South Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM), Sudanese students were granted free education in Egyptian universities under the 'Egyptian Scholarship for Sudanese Students' program. Between 1972 and 1982, 100 Sudanese students were granted scholarships each year. After the redivision of administrative districts in the south during 1982, the number admitted on the scholarship program rose to 300 students. This program was terminated in 1992. In recent years, higher education has become even less accessible for Sudanese students, as Egyptian universities have begun to charge refugee and foreign students high fees payable in hard currency. Moreover, due to reduced funding and a shift in policy, the UNHCR in Cairo has been limited in its capacity to assist students. Conflict with Authorities When Hosni Mubarak became the president in 1981, regulations were established to allow police to arrest and detain suspects for an undetermined period of time. Incidences of police brutality during raids and protests have led to the arbitrary detention of Sudanese refugees and, in some cases, death. =\\"Black Day\\"= In the Maadi district in 2003, from January 27-29th, Egyptian police raided the residences of refugees from Sudan, Liberia and other African countries. Accounts of ill treatment such as discrimination and assault were reported by detainees‚Äìsome of whom held refugee cards. A Liberian detainee reported: According to the reports of other detained refugees, Egyptian police referred to the raid as \\"Black Day,\\" labelling their intake sheets \\"Operation Track Down Blacks.\\" =Mohandessin protests= An August 2004, Sudanese refugees, backed by the Egyptian non-governmental organisation SOUTH, mounted a protest against the issuing of yellow cards outside the UNHCR office. Police and security officers arrested and dispersed refugees with tear gas. In October to December 2005, some 2,000 people participated daily in a protest camp in a park at a busy intersection in front of Mustafa Mahmoud Mosque. The camp was located in an upper middle class suburb where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has an office - protesting about conditions in Egypt and seeking to be resettled in another country. The camp had been formed on September 29, 2005 by several dozen people who organized with Refugee Voices, a Sudanese refugee group. The Cairo office of UNHCR closed indefinitely in mid-November, after saying it was forced by the sit-in to suspend operations in October. In the early hours of Friday, December 30, 2005 police raided the camp and clashes ensued in the presence of TV cameras and the press. They dragged the refugees across the street, pulled women from their hair and pushed the elderly carrying newborn babies. Refugees were put in public transit busses to be transferred to central security force camps in different locations in Egypt in addition to taking some of them to State security intelligence offices. Many of those taken to the camps suffered fractures and injuries and lack any medical help. At least 28, and as many as 100, Sudanese migrants seeking refugee status were killed. At least one committed suicide in the wake of the raid.(FMRS 2006:37-38) The camp was forcibly dismantled and 2,174 protesters were detained. The incident named later the \\"Mustapha Mahmoud Park Massacre\\" led many refugees to decide to seek shelter in Israel.Sabar, Galia and Tsurkov, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs Policies toward Asylum-Seekers: 2002-2014.‚Äù Istituto Affari Internazionali, IAI working paper 15 (2015).Print. Shortly after the arrests, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry announced it would deport 645 of the arrested people as \\"illegal immigrants.\\" In late January, the government agreed to allow the UNHCR to perform a status determination on those it wishes to deport. 165 refugee card holders were released from custody. 485 remain in custody at Al-Qanater Prison, Abu Zaabal Prison, and Shebeen Al-Kom and other detention centres.

At this point, the Turnpike carries Interstates 70 and 76. When the tunnel was built, it was considered an \\"engineering marvel.\\" The tunnel was built in 1939 and is used by 11 million vehicles annually today. Throughout the 2000s, state officials attempted to implement plans to replace the tunnel, citing its age.  History  The original Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was built in the late 19th century for the South Pennsylvania Railroad, which was never completed. This tunnel was not used due to concerns about its structural integrity. The eastern end of this original tunnel can be seen by parking on the service road at the turnpike's eastern portal and walking up to the area just above and a bit north of the turnpike portal. The opening is visible in the rocks just uphill. Entering this old tunnel is prohibited. The current westbound tunnel was built in 1939 as part of the original construction for the highway. At first, this tunnel served both westbound and eastbound traffic with a single lane in each direction. The eastbound tunnel was completed in 1965 as part of an expansion and upgrade of the turnpike due to increased traffic volume. Both tunnels are approximately 6,070 feet (1,850 m) in length, making them the longest tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike that are still in use (the bypassed Sideling Hill Tunnel is slightly longer, at 6,782 feet (2,067 m)). Explosives and other hazardous materials are not allowed in the tunnels. Vehicles carrying these materials must exit before the tunnel and take other roads around the tunnel. Restrictions on some hazardous materials in non-bulk form have been lifted.  Maintenance and replacement  Long term plans call for major maintenance to be performed on the tunnels; however, this presents a major problem for traffic. Terrible backups prompted officials to build the second tube. With today's traffic volumes, it would not be feasible to close one tube and route all traffic through the other. On October 22, 2013, WJAC-TV reported that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission had decided to replace the tunnel with either a new tunnel or a bypass. The reason for the replacement was that officials determined that the tunnel had reached old age and was becoming run-down. By 2013, the original (westbound) tunnel was 73 years old, servicing approximately 11 million vehicles every year. A local hunting group called Mountain Field and Stream Club owns 1,000 acres of land around the tunnel, and the group had opposed plans to replace the tunnel in 2001. Possible plans include building a third tunnel, as well as bypassing the tunnels completely as was done for the Laurel Hill, Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels. On December 24, 2014, the PTC announced it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. In 2020, following analysis of several design alternatives, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission opted for a road cut to the south of the tunnels. The option chosen is both the cheapest, at $332 million, and has the fewest environmental impacts of the studied concepts. Additionally, the project will involve the realignment of adjacent portions of the road to eliminate several sharp curves. While the project will be heading to final design, no funding for construction has been identified.

The original law was passed in 1984 and it contains 7 chapters, a preamble and a section that contains the lyrics of the national anthem. The law itself was changed several times, most recently in 2005. Chapter One It consists of two sentences, simply stating that the flag, arms and anthem are the symbols of the country and that this law was established to render honor and respect to the symbols. Chapter Two Consisting of three articles, this chapter contains brief descriptions of each national symbol. Article two describes the coat of arms, article 3 describes the flag and explains that the national anthem will be established according to other laws. Each article states that a copy of each symbol will be kept at the General National Archive (Archivo General de la Naci√≥n) and the National History Museum (Museo Nacional de Historia). Chapter Three Consisting of two articles, this chapter describes how the coat of arms can be made or used. Article 4 states that the coat of arms will be made according to what was stated in Chapter 2 of this law and Article 5 states that certain officials, documents, seals and laws can be affixed with a special coat of arms. The difference with this coat of arms is that the entire arms is black and white, and the words \\"Estados Unidos Mexicanos\\" (United Mexican States) appear in a semicircle at the top of the arms, between the olive branch and the oak wreath. Article 5 also states that the coat of arms can be affixed to vehicles operated by the government, such as vehicles that transport the President of Mexico. Chapter Four This chapter, which describes about the national flag in detail, is the longest of the three chapters on each symbol. Consisting of thirty articles, this chapter lists dates on when the Mexican flag is flown and how it is flown, about the various honors that is presented to the flag and the various flag devices that can be used, such as the corbata. This chapter also sets the guidelines for the use of the Mexican Presidential Sash.

History The Mono Men rose up from the ashes of another Washington band, the Roofdogs. John Mortensen came from the Dehumanizers and Game for Vultures before joining the Mono Men. The band came together in late 1987. They played shows in Europe, Mexico, Japan, Canada, and the United States. They were featured in the Northwest Rock & Roll documentary Hype!.

A number of approaches to universal logic have been proposed since the twentieth century, using model theoretic, and categorical approaches.  Development  The roots of universal logic may go as far back as some work of Alfred Tarski in the early twentieth century, but the modern notion was first presented in the 1990s by Swiss logician Jean-Yves B√©ziau.The Road to Universal Logic: Festschrift for 50th Birthday of Jean-Yves B√©ziau Volume I, edited by Arnold Koslow and Arthur Buchsbaum 2014 Birkh√§user pp 2-10 The term 'universal logic' has also been separately used by logicians such as Richard Sylvan and Ross Brady to refer to a new type of (weak) relevant logic.Brady, R. 2006. Universal Logic. Stanford: CSLI Publications. . In the context defined by B√©ziau, three main approaches to universal logic have been explored in depth: * An abstract model theory system axiomatized by Jon Barwise,Jon Barwise. Axioms for abstract model theory. Annals of Mathematical Logic,7:221‚Äì265, 1974 * a topological/categorical approach based on sketches (sometimes called categorical model theory),Steffen Lewitzka \\"A Topological Approach to Universal Logic\\" Logica Universalis 2007 Birkhauser pp 35-61 * a categorical approach originating in Computer Science based on Goguen and Burstall's notion of institution.Razvan Diaconescu, \\"Three decades of institution theory\\" in Universal Logic: An Anthology edited by Jean-Yves B√©ziau 2012 Springer pp 309-322 While logic has been studied for centuries, Mossakowski et al commented in 2007 that \\"it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of \\"a logic\\".T. Mossakowski, J. A. Goguen, R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, \\"What is a Logic?\\", Logica Universalis 2007 Birkhauser, pp. 113‚Äì133. These approaches to universal logic thus aim to address and formalize the nature of what may be called 'logic' as a form of \\"sound reasoning\\".  World Congresses and Schools on Universal Logic  Since 2005, B√©ziau has been organizing world congresses and schools on universal logic. These events bring together hundreds of researchers and students in the field and offer tutorials and research talks on a wide range of subjects. * First World Congress and School on Universal Logic, 26 March‚Äì3 April 2005, Montreux, Switzerland.

The lower course is a well preserved Romanesque, double-groined 13th century towerhouse structure, built by the Frasers of Muchalls. Upon this structure, the 17th-century castle was begun by Alexander Burnett of Leys and completed by his son, Sir Thomas Burnett, 1st Baronet, in 1627. The Burnetts of Leys built the remaining four storey present day castle. One of the most interesting castles of northeast Scotland, according to noted architectural historian Nigel Tranter, it is designed in the classic L style with a further extension wing at the west end. Muchalls Castle entered national history in 1638 when a seminal Covenanter gathering took place here precedent to the English Civil War. The plasterwork ceilings of the principal drawing rooms are generally regarded as among the three finest examples of plasterwork ceilings in Scotland. These adornments date to 1624 and are in virtually perfect condition. They consist of heraldry of the Burnett of Leys family, along with heraldry of relations and friends intermixed with biblical iconography. The overmantel of the Great Hall fireplace features the arms of King James VI flanked by impressive egyptianesque figures. Middle Ages origins The lower course of this L-plan castle is the original 14th-century ground level of the Clan Fraser tower house. On this level are a dungeon, guard room, storerooms, a chamber for merchants and visitors waiting to see the Laird, and a medieval kitchen. In the medieval kitchen the interior wall is over five metres thick, accommodating a hidden staircase and affording bearing strength to support the upper levels. A long hall passageway was constructed as a barrel vaulted design. The dungeon is noted for its small window and still has the large steel hinges to which the dungeon door would have attached. The medieval kitchen has its original 14th-century flagstones; moreover, this room features a large walk-in fireplace with a secret spiral staircase that servants would have used in medieval times to carry meals to the higher levels. (Servants at that time would have not been allowed on the main staircases used by the nobility who dwelt in the castle.) Ownership of the castle and lands passed to the Hays in the 15th century probably associated with the same real estate transaction of the lands of Ury in 1413 AD. Seventeenth-century reconstruction by the Burnetts of Leys King James VI Arms in the Great Hall The second floor level (referred to as the first floor in Scotland) is erected over the intact Middle Ages ground level structure. Prominent exterior features are: a set of well-sculpted corbelled turrets; massive ranges of chimneys: a curtain-walled entrance courtyard with two sets of triple gunloops flanking the entrance arch; a subterranean crypt; and well-preserved 17th century high stone walled terraced gardens. The bartizans render interesting interior features in numerous of the bedrooms, providing interesting circular nooks with small lookout windows strategically placed at upper building corners. There are numerous original arrow slits that indicate the original defensive nature of the structure; some of these arrow slits penetrate exterior walls that are over a metre thick. There are a number of crow-stepped gables associated with large chimneys at building endpoints. The castle itself is an A listed historical building; however, there are three further listed structures on the castle grounds, including a fine stone stables and a 17th- century dovecote. The next level includes most of the principal reception rooms, including the Great Hall, the Ladies' Drawing Room and the Gentlemen's Study. These reception rooms are the main locations of the elaborate plasterwork; in fact, the ceilings of these three rooms are totally covered in original 17th-century plasterwork with heraldic coats of arms, biblical figures and other historical figures. The great hall fireplace has an original plasterwork overmantel featuring egyptianesque caryatid figures and the King James Arms. One can walk erect inside the fireplace and conduct a small meeting inside with bench seating built in. The firebox also hosts the Laird's Lug, a secret listening system allowing the Laird to overhear conversations in the Great Hall from his suite above. The third level consists of a number of bedrooms: The Laird's Bedroom, The Priest's Bedroom, The Queen's Bedroom, The Queen's Winter Bedroom. The Queen naturally had a very elegant room in case she were to visit; in fact, she had a Winter Bedroom for inclement weather. Each of the bedrooms has a fireplace, as do some of the bathrooms. The bathrooms are a Victorian modification of what would have been dressing rooms in the 17th century. Several generations of the Burnett of Leys family lived in Muchalls Castle. Later residents included James Robertson, Baron Robertson, President of the Scottish Court of Session, and Geraldine Simpson (n√©e Pringle), heiress to the Pringle knitting fortune. Role in Covenanters history Muchalls Castle was the location of an important turning point in the Reformation in Scotland. In 1638 at Edinburgh signatories to a Covenant opposed imposition of the Episcopal liturgical system then backed by the King. Aberdeen was one of the last holdouts to confirm this covenant, its opposition led by six scholars at Marischal College and King's College remembered as the Aberdeen doctors. Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, Laird of Muchalls Castle, along with James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, Dickson, Henderson, Lord Coupar, the Master of Forbes and others formed a delegation of Covenanters to approach the doctors. The doctors offered the Cup of Bon Accord to the Covenanters and had laid out an elaborate banquet; however, very dramatically, the Covenanters refused the Cup, stating they would not meet until the doctors had signed the Covenant. The doctors were very disturbed and composed a list of queries, demanding the Covenanters response. Muchalls Castle was the site of the Covenanters meeting where they drew up their plucky and learned response to the doctors. From this confrontation and other concomitant events, Charles I unexpectedly made sweeping reforms and concessions to the Covenanters including revocation of the Service Book and Canons, repeal of the Perth Articles and enjoined subscription to Craigs Negative Confession of 1580, a document condemning papal errors. Victorian period to 20th century Ownership of Muchalls Castle passed from the Burnett of Leys family about 1882. A prominent owner of the castle in late Victorian times was James Robertson, Baron Robertson, Lord Advocate of Scotland. Policies and estate The castle is perched near the apex of a large knoll overlooking the North Sea with a forest policy (woodland surrounding a large estate) of very old sycamore, elm and beech trees forming the northern and eastern policy boundaries. These trees form a canopy attaining 50 metres in height, and are the domain of rookeries of crow and jackdaw. There is a population of several hundred of these birds, which are commonly associated with other Scottish castles; in fact, the current owners have purchased a tangent northern parcel, which is known on historic maps as \\"Crow Woods\\" and is a similar forest of mature trees that house crow and jackdaw flocks. 14th century drystone wall at Muchalls Castle, Scotland The southeastern, southern and western exposures have a thinner lower woodland policy, historically to allow free viewing of the North Sea and expansive valley views to the south and west. The principal gardens are situated in a series of declining terraces on the western side of the castle. These gardens were studied by a historical landscape architect in 2001 and determined to be the original early 17th century design, including enclosing dry-stone walls. Further evidence of the original design period is manifested by a subtle pattern in the western lawn nearest the castle, which has been documented to be undulations echoing an elaborate subsurface stonework pattern, a hallmark of the 17th-century garden plan. On the southern lawn there is a rare species of tree known as the weeping elm. This specimen is one of the oldest in Scotland, measuring a height of 12 metres. There are a total of seven principal lawns summing to an area of . Further there are a total of five agricultural fields as part of the castle estate which are managed to accommodate cattle, sheep and crops of wheat, barley and hay. The castle is accessed via a private drive of about three quarters of a mile long, that runs across the castle estate. One of the most intriguing discoveries of the 1990s was a hewn slab about two metres wide that spans a burn running along the southern portion of the estate. This slab had not been recorded on any of the historic maps from the most recent 200 years, but is the exact width needed to accommodate a carriage. This discovery was used to support the theory espoused by the present owners that the original castle access was from the south and not the west as shown on maps of the last two centuries and resulted in securing council approval to reconstruct the ancient approach as the main access drive . Area setting Muchalls Castle is perched on high ground with a commanding view of the North Sea less than a half mile distant. It lies on the ancient Causey Mounth road linking Stonehaven to Aberdeen via the Portlethen Moss. Muchalls Castle has sweeping views to the south and east of a valley that was the northernmost point of the Roman army's advance into the Scottish highlands. The Romans built a major encampment Raedykes about three miles (5 km) to the southeast, which has yielded many interesting artifacts. In nearby Stonehaven is Stonehaven Tolbooth, where Episcopal clergy were imprisoned for conducting services at the chapel on the Muchalls Castle estate. Other notable structures nearby that have historical links to Muchalls Castle are Fetteresso Castle, Dunnottar Castle, Crathes Castle and Monboddo House, the home of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, the father of modern historical linguistics and a pre-evolutionary thinker.

The list contained the names, dates of birth, aliases, and national insurance numbers of those people deemed not suitable to work with children in schools, social work and voluntary settings. History In 1955, the list that came to be called List 99 was started by the Home Office Consultancy Service. (In 2000, a similar but distinct list was created by the Protection of Children Act 1999.) The Bichard Enquiry (2003) resulted in a report (2004) that noted shortcomings in the use of List 99. As of 2007, List 99 contained approximately 5000 names.

The set is mostly in silver-gilt, but includes two Japanese export porcelain Imari ware teacups and saucers. For a lady's dressing-table, including items for snacks and hot drinks. Household silver or silverware (the silver, the plate, or silver service) includes tableware, cutlery, and other household items made of sterling silver, silver gilt, Britannia silver, or Sheffield plate silver. Silver is sometimes bought in sets or combined to form sets, such as a set of silver candlesticks or a silver tea set. Historically, silverware was divided into table silver, for eating, and dressing silver for bedrooms and dressing rooms. The grandest form of the latter was the toilet service, typically of 10-30 pieces, often silver-gilt, which was especially a feature of the period from 1650 to about 1780. History Late Roman spoons, Hoxne Hoard, England Elites in most ancient cultures preferred to eat off precious metals (\\"plate\\") at the table; China and Japan were two major exceptions, using lacquerware and later fine pottery, especially porcelain. In Europe the elites dined off metal, usually silver for the rich and pewter or latten for the middling classes, from the ancient Greeks and Romans until the 18th century. Another alternative was the trencher, a large flat piece of either bread or wood. In the Middle Ages this was a common way of serving food, the bread also being eaten; even in elite dining it was not fully replaced in France until the 1650s.Strong, 226 Possession of silverware obviously depends on individual wealth; the greater the means, the higher was the quality of tableware that was owned and the more numerous its pieces. The materials used were often controlled by sumptuary laws. In the late Middle Ages and for much of the Early Modern period much of a great person's disposable assets were often in plate, and what was not in use for a given meal was often displayed on a dressoir de parement or buffet (indeed, similar to a large Welsh dresser) in the dining hall. At the wedding of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal in 1429, there was a dresser 20 feet long on either side of the room, each with five rows of plate.Strong, 96-98. Strong says 1429, the year the proxy wedding took place. The bride arrived by sea in late 1429, but the formal marriage ceremony was not until January 1430. Inventories of King Charles V of France (r. 1364‚Äì1380) record that he had 2,500 pieces of plate.Strong, 97 Plate was often melted down to finance wars or building, and hardly any of the enormous quantities recorded in the later Middle Ages survives. The French Royal Gold Cup now in the British Museum, in solid gold and decorated with enamel and pearls, is one of few exceptions. Maintenance Silver requires a good deal of care, as it tarnishes and must be hand polished, since careless or machine polishing ruins the patina and can completely erode the silver layer in Sheffield plate. A silverman or silver butler has expertise and professional knowledge of the management, secure storage, use, and cleaning of all silverware, associated tableware, and other paraphernalia for use at military and other special functions. This expertise covers the maintenance, cleaning, proper use, and presentation of these assets to create aesthetically correct layouts for effective ambience at such splendid occasions. The role of silverman tends now to be restricted to some private houses and large organizations, in particular the military. One advantage of silverware is that growth of bacteria is inhibited by the oligodynamic effect.

In 1985 he directed the music video A Day for the band XYMOX on the 4AD Records label, leading him towards musical subjects. 1987 saw his short experimental films Wagner‚Äòs Ring, a distillation of The Ring in 3'50\\" conceived with John Cage; and Stoperas 1/2 which was created to be shown with Cage's Europeras 1 & 2\\\\. Collaborations with Cage continued with the conceptual film Chessfilmnoise (1988), a documentary on Cage and Elliott Carter Time Is Music (1988), and From Zero (1995) in collaboration with Andrew Culver. The great composers Scheffer‚Äôs films on music constitute an overview of the great composers of the 20th century ‚Äî from Conducting Mahler (1996) on the 1995 Mahler Festival in Amsterdam with Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Chailly, Riccardo Muti and Simon Rattle to Five Orchestral Pieces (1994) on Arnold Sch√∂nberg's work conducted by Michael Gielen and The Final Chorale (1990) on Igor Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw. Further documentaries include films on Louis Andriessen (The Road, 1997, conducted by P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s), Luciano Berio (Voyage to Cythera from 1999 on his Sinfonia conducted by the composer), Pierre Boulez (Eclat, 1993), and (Helikopter String Quartet, 1996) with Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Arditti Quartet. Contemporary composers and experimental projects The history of Electronic Music, from Stockhausen to DJ Spooky and Squarepusher, was the subject of Sonic Acts film in (1998). This was followed by three experimental projects searching for the influence of the digital medium in film and music: Sonic Images (1998), Sonic Fragments / The Poetics of Digital Fragmentation (1999) and Sonic Genetics (2000). In 1999 Scheffer made Music for Airports, a video on Brian Eno's music of the same name as arranged by Bang on a Can founders Julia Wolfe, Michael Gordon, David Lang and Evan Ziporyn. The sprawling In the Ocean (2001), on present day New York composers, features Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Elliott Carter, John Cage, Brian Eno and the Bang on a Can founders. Scheffer is also working on several in depth films on specific composers ‚Äî The Present Day Composer Refuses to Die on Frank Zappa, in cooperation with the Zappa Family Trust (2000, featuring The Mothers of Invention, Pierre Boulez and Ensemble Modern), and the 90-minute Zappa feature Phaze II, The Big Note (2002), to be followed by a third film which will complete his Zappa trilogy. Scheffer has been following and filming Elliott Carter for 25 years; this culminated in A Labyrinth of Time (2005), a portrait on the composer as well as a view of the history of modernism in the 20th century. In 2005 Scheffer also finished a feature-length documentary on the Tea-Opera composed by Tan Dun, with Pierre Audi (Director) and Xiu Ying(libretto), Tea. This film had its world premiere in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 2006 a retrospective of his work and a Docu-Concert was exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A documentary on the Tehran Philharmonic Orchestra and its chief conductor, the Iranian composer Nader Mashayekhi with the title To Be And Not To Be was premiered at the doku-arts festival June 2009. A feature-length documentary on composer Edgard Var√®se with the title The One All Alone was selected for the 2009 Venice Film Festival. In 2010 he finished Eastern Voices featuring a.o. Syrian musician Ibrahim Keivo and one of the finest voices in the world today the Aserbajanian singer Alim Qasimov. It won the German Record Critics' Award 2011 (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik) for the DVD in Germany. A feature-length documentary on the Iranian composer Nader Mashayekhi, Gozaran / Time Passing. In 2011 Gozaran / Time Passing was selected for the international competition of the IDFA (International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam). To celebrate the 100th birthday of John Cage in 2012, he made an experimental film called Ryoanji and re-edited the film material shot in 1987 with the title: How To Get Out Of The Cage (A year with John Cage). It won again the German Record Critics' Award 2012 (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik). He is currently shooting a documentary on the Chinese composer Guo Wenjing and the Sichuan opera. In the future dramatic features based on Die Zauberfl√∂te composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the parallel lives of Gustav Mahler and Arnold Sch√∂nberg, are planned.

Heeled bullets mostly disappeared with the advent of smokeless powder cartridges, though older rimfire designs, such as the .22 caliber rimfire cartridges, still use heeled bullets, and many cartridges that date back to the black powder era still reflect their heeled bullet origins in their caliber designations. Reasons for change The heeled bullet design has many advantages, mainly when coupled with the straight or slightly tapered walled cases it appeared in. For pistols, converting a cap and ball revolver to use cartridges was as simple as cutting off part of the rear of the cylinder, replacing it with a frame-mounted ring, and changing the hammer. It also made new revolvers easier and cheaper to manufacture as the chambers could simply be drilled straight through the cylinder, whereas bullets narrower than the case required two different diameters to be drilled, and careful control of the depth for the larger diameter bit. Finally, it made it very easy to chamber cartridges of the same diameter but differing lengths in the same firearm, which is still commonly seen today in .22 caliber rimfire firearms, which are marked \\".22 Short, Long, and Long Rifle\\". While this can be done with straight-walled cases not using heeled bullets, such as .38 Special in .357 Magnum firearms, it tends to create lead and powder residue buildup at the front of the chamber, which can cause reliability problems if not cleaned out before switching back to the longer case. One of the primary reasons for the change was the issue of lubrication. Lead bullets, especially soft, low alloy lead used in low pressure cartridges, need to be lubricated to prevent lead buildup in the bore. This lubricant can be applied either to the exposed portion of the heeled bullet, called outside lubricated, or on the portion inside the case, called inside lubricated. Outside lubrication requires a hard, dry lubricant, as anything soft or sticky will rub off or pick up dirt that comes in contact. Inside lubrication, on the other hand, can use sticky wax or grease, but then needs some means for the lubricant to reach the wall of the bore, since the diameter of the heel is smaller than the bore. While there were some methods patented to allow inside lubrication of heeled bullets (such as a piston at the base, which forces lubricant out of ports in the exposed sides of the bullet upon firing), they never became popular, due to the complexity and expense involved. Non-heeled bullets, however, can easily be lubricated on the portion inside the case using a grease groove packed with lubricant. This prevents the lubricant, usually a grease or wax, from picking up dirt and grit which can damage the bore. Surviving examples Arguably, heeled bullets are still very common because, while very few calibers use them, the .22 Long Rifle does, and it is the most commonly used cartridge in the world. The other cartridges in the .22 Long Rifle family, the .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 CB and .22 BB, all use heeled bullets. A few other heeled-bullet cartridges are available, but they all originated in the late 19th century. The recent gains in popularity of Cowboy Action Shooting has increased interest in these old cartridges, and there are even a few new replica firearms being made to chamber them. Cartridges evolved from heeled bullet designs To convert a heeled-bullet cartridge to a non-heeled design, it was necessary to either enlarge the case diameter, or shrink the bullet and bore diameter. Examples of both choices can be found, but some of the more evident and confusing examples are cases where the bullet diameter was reduced. Many shooters wonder why a .38 caliber firearm actually shoots bullets of diameter .357 inches (9.1 mm), and a .44 caliber firearm shoots bullets. In both of these cases, the name of the caliber derives from older heeled-bullet designs, and the name was kept even when the bullet was shrunk to fit inside the case. The .38 S&W; cartridge, for example, dates from 1877 and has a nominal outside case diameter of .380 inches, while the inside of the case is .360 inches. Older .38 caliber cartridges, like the .38 Short Colt, did use a heeled bullet, so rather than create a new \\".35\\" or \\".36 caliber\\", Smith & Wesson kept the designation \\".38\\" even though it no longer accurately reflected the groove diameter. The later .38 Special continued the trend, and even automatic pistol cartridges like the .38 Super and .380 ACP retained the .38 caliber designation, even though they were .357s. This continued until 1935 and the introduction of the .38 Special-based .357 Magnum cartridge. The newer (1956) .44 Magnum, however, retained the designation of its parent .44 Special cartridge, even though it fired a .429 inch bullet. The legacy of heeled bullets is the cause of confusion among many shooting enthusiasts over the actual physical diameters of the bullets they fire in their guns.

The word derives from the Old Teutonic (hall√¢), where it is associated with the idea of covering or concealing. In modern German it is Halle where it refers to a building but Saal where it refers to a large public room though the distinction is blurred:(Halle (Architektur) (de)). The latter may arise from a genitive form of the former. The French salle is borrowed from the German. Simple beginnings Market hall and town square in Caylus, Tarn-et-Garonne, France. The Oxford English Dictionary gives nine meanings of hall relevant to buildings with a root of the word meaning \\"...to cover, conceal.\\"Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009. Hall A hall is, fundamentally, a relatively large space enclosed by a roof such as a market hall. Coming from the Old English language, it was brought into Britain in the fifth century. A hall is also a large, public or stately room in a building. Hall also may refer to a building itself where meetings or events occur such as Westminster Hall, a concert hall, a Guild hall, town hall. Also a dwelling-house with a large, open room (the hall) typically with an open hearth such as the original form of the Wealden hall house. In 500, such a simple building was the residence of a lord and his retainers. This is the kind of hall which Beowulf knew. Even now, hall is the term used for a country house in midland and northern England. The concept was more fundamental than referring to just domestic buildings. Though the lord's hall had an administrative aspect, this was more prominent in the town hall and the guild hall. The term might even be applied to a temple, in the same way as a basilica, now an ecclesiastical building, originated as a lordly reception hall with other domestic and other buildings close by in the same compound, just like an Anglo-Saxon moated hall but in a warmer climate. Compare the Basilica in Trier. (picture). Similarly, the French word salle can refer to a large, former church building such as the Salle Stengel de Lorentzen (fr) or to a sports hall (fr) large enough for playing hockey in. A plan of a late medieval hall house called Horham Hall. Here, the screens passage has a porch at one end; the upper, dais, end has a grander window. The main staircase is at the dais end and photos show that the hall was the full height of the house. Plan view of a simple hall house Medieval developments Later, partitions were set up so that the lord's family could have more privacy, a fairly new concept in northern Europe at the time. The English had come to Britain from a part of Europe which had not been directly exposed to the ways of the Roman Empire. As further time passed, the hall became the largest room of the house, often referred to as the great hall. While the humbler residents still slept there, the lord's family had one or more chambers at one end of the building in what came to be called the solar. At this stage, we have the hall house in which the central room is the great hall. Off one end is the solar while a partition divides the other end of the hall off as the screens passage. Across the passage lie the pantry and buttery with between them, a passage through to the kitchen. The function of the last had been removed from the hall for the convenience of both cooks and inhabitants but also because roasting fires were a serious fire risk. Kitchens were by this time, built of more fireproof materials in a separate building. These arrangements were well established by the fifteenth century. At some stage, one of these divisions was the parlour, a concept which was in secular use by 1374. The Red Hall, Bourne, Lincolnshire. c. 1620 Renaissance domesticity During the sixteenth the process of subdivision proceeded. Notably, in an increasing number of cases, this was by inserting a floor, dividing the space which would have been occupied by the open hall in two, horizontally. From the early seventeenth century, the hall was usually a space inside the front door, more or less grand, in keeping with the grandeur of the house, in which people were first welcomed before proceeding to one of the partitioned rooms. The Red Hall in Bourne from about 1620 is still called a hall, but is designed not around a great hall but its staircase. Its hall, at the front door, has rather the nature of a passage leading to the featured staircase at the back of the house. The hall has a ceiling as low as any other in the house. In a modern house, the hall is the space inside the front door from which the rooms are reached. Where this kind of hall is elongated, it may be called a passage, or hallway. The corresponding space upstairs is a landing. Other aspects In an early medieval building, as in the round Iron Age houses before them, the hall was where the fire was kept. With time, its functions as dormitory, kitchen, parlour and so on were divided off to separate rooms or, in the case of the kitchen, a separate building. =University halls= On the same principle many buildings at colleges and universities are formally titled \\"So-and-so Hall\\". Such a hall is typically named after the person who endowed it, for example, King's Hall, Cambridge. Others, such as Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, commemorate respected people. Between these in age, Nassau Hall at Princeton University began as the single building of the then college, showing a continuation of the medieval European pattern in America. The medieval universities had developed from colleges, that is groups of like-minded people living together in halls similar to the lordly ones described above and sleeping in carrels or separate rooms around the great hall. In many cases, some aspect of this community remains in the modern institution. At colleges in the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham for example, Hall is the dining hall for students, with High Table, on the dais at the high end, for fellows. Typically, at \\"Formal Hall\\", gowns are worn for dinner during the evening, whereas for \\"informal Hall\\" they are not. =Livery companies= Many Livery Companies such as the Mercers in the City of London, have a Hall which serves as their headquarters and meeting place. In origin, this was just like the lordly hall with its great hall though the peripheral rooms would have their specialist uses as parlours and robing rooms for example. =Public halls= Similarly a hall is also a building consisting largely of a principal room, whether medieval like Westminster Hall or more modern like Carnegie Hall, used for various ceremonial, social or concert events. Most public halls of this sort are available for renting out for meetings and social affairs. It may be privately or government-owned, such as a function hall owned by one company used for weddings and cotillions (organized and run by the same company on a contractual basis) or a community hall available for rent to anyone. Following a line of similar development: *In office buildings and larger buildings (theatres, cinemas etc.), the entrance hall is generally known as the foyer (the French for fireplace). The atrium, a name sometimes used in public buildings for the entrance hall, was the central courtyard of a Roman house. Derived from the residential meanings of the word: *Hall is also a surname of people, one of whose ancestors may have lived or worked in a hall as distinct from one such as David M. Cote, whose ancestor was named for a \\"cote\\": a much humbler place shared with the livestock. Association with salt From a completely separate derivation: A Hall is a brand of bitter (beer) made in Germany and sold worldwide, mainly across America. *In German speaking areas, Hall (with a short a) can also form part of a town name, like Halle, where the name refers to hall, the Celtic word for salt (compare Welsh halen or Breton holen or Cornish holan). In this connection, Hall is the short form of the name of: # the medieval German town Schw√§bisch Hall, where Hall was its whole name prior to 1933 # the Austrian town Hall in Tirol near Innsbruck, which used to be called Solbad Hall from 1938 to 1974, #Hallstatt in Austria, which gave its name to the Celtic Hallstatt culture. Sir Charles Hall√© (originally Karl Halle) lent his name to the Hall√© Orchestra. His forebears were probably associated with the German town of Halle. The accent was added to his name in order to assist English-speakers in pronouncing the word. In the ancient world, the Celts were neighbours of the Greeks, whose word for salt was h√°ls (·ºÖŒªœÇ). While European science was developing, some branches of it adopted the Greek language as the source of its terminology. English therefore has words like halogen, halide, halotrichite and the hybrid halocarbon.

Finance came from the Hellenic Navy and donors such as Frank Welsh (a banker, writer and trireme enthusiast). Morrison, Coates and Willink founded the Trireme Trust together with Welsh. The Trireme Trust is now chaired by professor Boris Rankov. The bronze bow ram weighs 200 kg. It is a copy of an original ram now in the Piraeus archaeological museum. The ship was built from Douglas fir and Virginia oak. The keel is of iroko. The important hypozomata (bracing ropes) had to be replaced by a steel rope because no natural fibre or synthetic fibre ropes with about the same elastic modulus as hemp could be obtained for economic reasons. The steel cables' tension varied as the hull bent on the waves, rather than exerting constant tension like a natural fibre rope. This caused the alarming possibility of the rope breaking and endangering the crew, so protective measures had to be taken. She underwent sea trials in 1987, 1990, 1992 and 1994, but one of the most informative was a 1987 exercise crewed by 170 volunteer oarsmen and oarswomen. Olympias achieved a speed of and was able to perform 180 degree turns within one minute, in an arc no wider than two and a half (2.5) ship-lengths. These results, achieved with an inexperienced, mixed crew, suggest that ancient historians like Thucydides were not exaggerating about the capabilities of triremes. Olympias was transported to Britain in 1993, to take part in events celebrating the 2,500 years since the beginning of democracy. In 2004 she was used to transport the Olympic Flame ceremonially from the port of Keratsini to the main port of Piraeus, as the Olympic Torch Relay approached Athens for the 2004 Summer Olympics. Olympias is now an exhibit in a dry dock at the Naval Tradition Park in Palaio Faliro, Athens, Greece. In the years 2016 to 2018, a number of trips in the Saronic Gulf were organized, with amateur rowers and passengers.  Technology  The trireme was a fast attack, light displacement vessel. In order to sustain the bending moments of her considerable length, a tightened rope (hypozomata) was mounted beneath the deck spanning from bow to stern. This was an ingenious way to increase rigidity of the hull. Today in modern construction it is called pre-tensioning. After every trip the triremes were pulled ashore in special slides and the hypozomata was re-tightened. The trireme hulls were constructed from planks with closely spaced and pegged mortise and tenon joints. When these are fitted carefully the hull can carry shear stresses well and stay watertight. It was estimated that her ramming speed should have been in excess of , something the present reconstruction could not achieve, possibly because it was overweight.

The movement's staff and resources are housed at the Churchwide Office of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in Chicago, Illinois. History LSM-USA was founded when two Lutheran college organizations, the Lutheran Student Association of America (LSAA, founded in 1922) and Gamma Delta (founded in 1928), merged in 1969 while gathered in convention in Boulder, Colorado. LSM-USA assumed LSAA's position in the World Student Christian Federation. Since its inception, LSM- USA has maintained the idea of being a pan-Lutheran organization. Until 1985, LSM-USA was supported and sponsored by the American Lutheran Church (ALC), the Lutheran Church in America (LCA), the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC), and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS). In 1984 the organization Lutherans Concerned/North America (LC/NA) began the Reconciling in Christ movement. This movement seeks Lutheran bodies that declare themselves accepting and affirming of all members of the body of Christ, regardless of ethnicity, age, or sexuality. LSM-USA became the first Lutheran organization to declare itself as Reconciling in Christ. As a result, the LCMS withdrew its support for LSM-USA in 1985, citing LSM-USA's decision to declare itself a Reconciling in Christ organization as well as other doctrinal disagreements. The LCMS then formed its own organization, the Lutheran Student Fellowship. In 1988 the ALC, the LCA, and the AELC merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), thus reducing the number of sponsoring bodies to one. However, LSM-USA remains open to all Lutherans. In 2004 LSM-USA entered into a full ministry partnership with Lutheran Youth Encounter. In 2007 LSM-USA began formal discussion of entering into a full- partnership with the ELCA. In 2009, the Legislative Assembly voted to pursue a formal partnership with the ELCA, so long as it retained its student-led structure and its Reconciling in Christ status. Additionally, at the 2008-2009 gathering, the assembly moved to change the Secretary of International and Multicultural Concerns position into a new position called the Advocate for Diversity and Service Learning. Structure LSM-USA is a self-governing student organization within the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. A National Council, made up of sixteen elected voting members and five non- voting members, meets throughout year to oversee organizational business and allow for National Council members to support one another in their ministry. The Council consists of the President; the Vice President, who also serves as the LSM-USA liaison to the ELCA's Lutheran Youth Organization (LYO); the Advocate for Diversity and Service Learning; an intern, a non-voting member who is paid for by the ELCA; presidents of the thirteen different regions; a web specialist; a liaison from the board of the LYO; and a national staff advisor, usually the campus minister of a university-based Lutheran campus ministry. Decision-making authority rests first with the body of LSM-USA gathered annually in plenary sessions at the National Gathering; then with the National Council when it gathers in session twice annually; and finally with the three national officers in between those meetings. National officers are elected at the National Gathering by all present voting members, while regional officers are elected individually by their regions at different points throughout the year. All elected members of the National Council serve one-year calendar year terms. Other work of the organization is often done through specially designated ad hoc committees that are filled by students and campus ministry advisors who are selected through an application process involving review by the National Officers, and who report to the National Council, from which they derive their constitutional authority. =Regional breakdown= Regions of LSM-USA *ALTO - Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma *Blue Ridge - North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia *Central - Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska *Desert Southwest - Arizona, New Mexico, Western Texas, Southwest Colorado, and south Nevada *Gulf Atlantic (GALSM) - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina *IMOK - Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky *Mid- Atlantic (MALSM) - Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia *Northeast (NELSM) - Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont *Pacific Northwest (PAC-NW) - Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington *Pacific Southwest (PAC-SW) - California, Hawaii, Nevada *Rocky Mountain (RMR) - Colorado, Utah, Wyoming *Tri-Ota - Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota *Central Midwest - Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and the upper peninsula of Michigan =National Council= The 2010 National Council consisted of the following members: National Officers *President - Smith Heavner, Tri-County Technical College *Vice-President - Emily Miller, University of North Carolina *Advocate for Diversity and Service-Learning - Katie Gorin, Arizona State University Regional Representatives *ALTO President - Leslie Crissup, University of Oklahoma *Blue Ridge President - Madison Lanier, University of North Carolina *Central President - Vacant *Central Midwest Movement President - Kylie Turner, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStout *Desert Southwest President - Bethany Ristau, Phoenix College *GALSM President - Justin Plumley *IMOK President - Joyce Partyka, Wittenberg University *MALSM President - Alyson Ledder, Temple University *NELSM President - Amanda Nelson *PAC-NW President - Vanessa Unti, Western Washington University *PAC-SW President - Katie DeLaurentis, California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo *RMR President - Elizabeth Beyer, University of Northern Colorado *Tri-Ota President - Jessica Tillman, North Dakota State University Web Specialist - Brian Rower, California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo Historian - Katie Gorin, Arizona State University Non-Voting Positions (advisory, liaison, or appointed) *Program Assistant for Youth and Young Adult Ministry ELCA - Katy Resop, alumnus, UW‚ÄìMadison (through May 2008) *National Staff Advisor - Rev.

Gatherings have been held in Chicago; New Orleans; Phoenix; Washington, D.C.; Houston; San Diego; and Denver. The national gathering is organized with the institutional and financial support of the ELCA because of the inability of an organization of college students such as LSM-USA to effectively negotiate with hotels and other vendors in the necessary ways. Acknowledging this absolutely vital support, the gathering is convened by the ELCA and Lutheran Student Movement ‚Äì USA under the authority of the National Council and is planned by a student committee with campus ministry advisers. Events at the gathering include worship, workshops, concerts, meals, dances, speakers, service projects, and plenary sessions. =Alternative spring break= In 2006 an annual alternative week-long spring break event, known as Breaking Out!, was instituted by LSM- USA. The event consists of service projects, theological education, social- ministry training, small group discussion, and community worship. Breaking Out! was originally envisioned as three separate weeks for up to thirty students each. A challenge grant from Thrivent Financial for Lutherans provides financial support for students to participate in the program. The inaugural event was held in Atlanta, March 19‚Äì25, 2006. The event is overseen by two committees of students: a planning committee, chaired by a student who participated in the previous year's event, and includes the president and intern of LSM as de facto members; and a fundraising committee, which is also chaired by a student from the previous year, and includes the secretary of LSM as a de facto member. These committees are responsible for planning the event and for selecting the participants from among the applicants. The planning committee generally does not accept more than two people from any single college or university. Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the 2007 planning committee chose the town of Ocean Springs, Mississippi as the site for Breaking Out! 2007. The event was held March 11‚Äì16, 2007. The 2008 event to be held in Washington, D.C. was canceled due to lack of participation. In 2009 LSM-USA leadership began a partnership with Lutheran Disaster Response (LDR) and its current What a Relief program. This partnership emerged to become a new program called Alternative Spring Break 2009. LSM-USA provided funds and service-learning workbooks to campus ministries, while LDR organized the locations for relief efforts. The ELCA provided the majority of coordination efforts for this project. In 2010 the ELCA decided to expand the Alternative Spring Break program to incorporate other ministries around the United States and abroad. LSM-USA was asked and decided to provide grants for student ministries to participate in a service- learning institute, which provided resources and time for discussion for leaders prior to their trips. These leaders were charged with disseminating the information from the institute to their students and leaders. The student group would then apply what they learned through the institute and on their trip.

Life  A son of Daud Khan, a Georgian prince and convert to Islam, by a concubine, he was born Khosro Mirza and brought up Muslim at the Persian court by eunuchs alongside young slave recruits. An intelligent and resolute in his decisions, he soon attracted the attention of Shah Abbas I of Safavid who appointed him, in 1618, a darugha (prefect) of the capital Isfahan. From 1625 to 1626, he took part in suppression of the Georgian opposition: he commanded a right flank at the victorious Battle of Marabda and saved part of the Persian troops from a complete disaster at the Battle of Ksani. In 1626, Khosro Mirza was recalled from Georgia and appointed the commander of the Shah's √©lite gholam corps (qollar-aghasi) three years later. In 1629, Abbas, lying on a deathbed, urged him to protect a grandson and heir Sam Mirza, the future Shah Safi, whom Khosro served faithfully. In 1630, he led a Persian army which defeated the Ottoman forces and captured Baghdad. In the early 1630s, he took part in sidelining and destruction of the Undiladze family, also of Georgian origin, who had dominated the Safavid court for years. Afterwards, he was sent to suppress the opposition of Georgians who had managed to unite the eastern regions of Kartli and Kakheti under Teimuraz I for a brief period of 1630-1633. Teimuraz was joined by a surviving Undiladze, Daud Khan. For his loyalty, Shah Safi appointed him as the new vali of Kartli, and granted him the name of Rostam Khan (Rostom, ·É†·Éù·É°·É¢·Éù·Éõ·Éò, in Georgian transliteration). Rostom then came to Georgia with a large Persian army commanded by his fellow Georgian Rustam Khan. He soon took control of Kartli and garrisoned all major fortresses with Persian forces, bringing them, however, under his tight control. His willingness to cooperate with his suzerain won for Kartli a larger degree of autonomy. A period of relative peace and prosperity ensued, with the cities and towns being revived, many deserted areas repopulated and commerce flourished. Although Muslim, Rostom helped to restore a major Georgian Orthodox cathedral of Living Pillar (Svetitskhoveli) at Mtskheta, and patronised Christian culture. However, Islam and Persian habits predominated at his court. He ruthlessly crushed an opposition of local nobles, putting to death the catholicos Eudemus I of Georgia, and invaded, in 1648, Kakheti, forcing Teimuraz to flee to Imereti (western Georgia). Throughout his reign, a question of succession appeared to be a challenging task. As he had no children, Rostom intended to make the Imeretian prince Mamuka his heir. The latter, however, was soon suspected to have been involved in a plot, and he had to return to his native Imereti. In 1642, Rostom adopted his kinsman Luarsab, Luarsab I of Kartli's great-grandson, but he was assassinated in 1652 while hunting. Another candidate for the succession, Rostom's stepson Otia, also died young, in 1646. Only in 1653 was able Rostom to choose his successor. It was Vakhtang of Mukhrani, a representative of a junior Mukhrani branch of the Bagrationi dynasty, who actually ran government in the last years of Rostom, and succeeded on his death on November 17, 1658. Rostom was buried in Qum, Persia, close to his late suzerain Abbas I. The 19th-century British diplomat Robert Grant Watson reported in his A History of Persia, \\"in one of the finest of tho gardens adjacent to tho city was the mausoleum of Rustem Khan, a prince of the royal house of Georgia who had embraced the tenets of the Mahomedan religion in order to obtain tho viceroyalty of his native country.\\"  Family  Rostom was married twice. After his return to Kartli, he wed c. 1635 Ketevan, daughter of Prince Gorjasp Abashishvili. Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset, followed by Cyril Toumanoff, erred in identifying her surname as Abashidze. The Abashishvili was a branch of the Baratashvili family. The wedding was celebrated in Christian and Muslim rites and Ketevan added a Persian name, Guldukhtar. The marriage was childless and Ketevan died shortly thereafter. In 1638, Rostom concluded a strategic marital alliance with the Dadiani princely dynasty of Mingrelia. His second wife was Mariam, sister of Levan II Dadiani, the reigning Prince of Mingrelia, and the former wife of Simon Gurieli, Prince of Guria. They had no children. After Rostom's death, Mariam was married his adopted son and successor, Vakhtang V.

Bampfylde Moore Carew (1693) was an English rogue, vagabond and impostor, who claimed to be King of the Beggars. Life He was the son of Reverend Theodore Carew, rector of Bickleigh. The Carews were a well-established Devonshire family. Although they had a reputation for adventurousness, Bampfylde Moore Carew took this to extremes, if his picaresque memoirs are to be believed. Little is known about his life beyond these, in which he is described on the title-page as \\"the Noted Devonshire Stroller and Dogstealer\\". The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew =Literary history= The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew was first published in 1745. Although it states that the contents were \\"noted by himself during his passage to America\\" and it is likely that facts were supplied by Carew, the author was probably Robert Goadby, a printer in Sherborne, Dorset, who published an early edition in 1749. It has been suggested that Carew dictated his memoirs to Mrs Goadby. The Life continued to be a best seller throughout the next hundred years in numerous editions as books and chapbooks. He became a nationally known character, appealing to a provincial audience. One edition of the Life was printed in Hull in 1785. How much of the Life is true is impossible now to know. Carew certainly travelled and is likely to have indulged in minor crimes, but many stories seem too fantastic or literary to be true. It appealed to the market for mild 'rogue' literature and many editions included a canting dictionary. The public found the Life appealing: an educated man from a good family who spent his life ingeniously and audaciously outwitting the establishment, including people who should have recognised him, and without ever doing anything really bad. Carew seemingly settled in Bickleigh towards the end of his life. This may have been because of an offer of support from his relative, Sir Thomas Carew of Bickerton, winning a lottery, or simply age and weariness. Some editions of the Life suggest that Carew reflected with sadness on how 'idly' he had spent his lifeperhaps making a racy story more acceptable by adding a moral ending. Carew died at Bickleigh in 1759, leaving a daughter. =Contents= Carew claims to have taken to the road after he ran away from Blundell's School in Tiverton. With friends, he chased a deer through fields causing damage, which caused farmers to complain to the headmaster. Carew ran away and, at an alehouse, fell in with a band of ‚Äúgypsies‚Äù. (These were almost certainly not Romany but vagabonds living off their wits.) Carew travelled widely, at first around Devon and then around England, supporting himself by playing confidence tricks on the wealthy. His first trick involved a ‚ÄúMadam Musgrove‚Äù, who asked for his help in discovering treasure she believed was hidden on her land. Carew, consulting ‚Äúthe secrets of his arts‚Äù for a fee of 20 guineas, informed her it was under a laurel tree but that she should not seek it until a particular day and hour. Of course, by the appointed time Carew and her money were long gone. This was a well-known and documented trick from a period when cunning folk were often consulted about lost items. Carew claimed to be a master of disguise, in which he followed the tradition of counterfeit rogues dating back to Thomas Harman. He masqueraded as a shipwrecked sailor (a popular way to claim alms), a clergyman, and defrauding ‚ÄúSquire Portman‚Äù twice in one day, first as a rat-catcher and then a woman whose daughter had been killed in a fire (another staple of fraudulent beggars). Carew then travelled to Newfoundland, where he stayed a short time. On his return, he pretended to be the mate of a vessel and eloped with the daughter of a respectable apothecary of Newcastle on Tyne, whom he afterwards married. After further years as a vagabond, he claimed to have been elected King of the Gypsies upon the death of Clause Patch. The ceremony described reproduces one from Thomas Harman‚Äôs Caveat for Common Cursitors, via the popular play Beggars' Bush by Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher, and Philip Massinger in which Clause is a character. Carew was convicted of being an idle vagrant and sentenced to be transported to Maryland. There he attempted to escape, was captured, escaped again, and fell in with friendly Indians. He travelled to Pennsylvania, swam the Delaware, adopted the guise of a Quaker, and made his way to Philadelphia and New York City. Having embarked for England, he escaped being pressed to serve in the Navy by pricking his hands and face, and rubbing in bay salt and gunpowder, so as to simulate smallpox (such tricks were commonplaces in rogue literature). On returning to England, he claims, he found his wife and daughter and then travelled to Scotland by 1745 in time to accompany Charles Edward Stuart to Carlisle and Derby. An interesting aside is that when he was sentenced to be transported to Maryland it was in the ships of a company run by a family of Bideford Port, Devon, which later married into the Moore, Bampfylde, and Carew families. There is a Bond and a Contract from Mr Davy, Clerk of the Peace and Justices, for the transport of Richard Bond, Bampfield Moore Carew, William Crocker, Abraham Hart, Edward Browne, John Smith, Judith Daw and Mary Underhill to Virginia. Bampfield Moore Carew's name is inserted in the Bond only.QS/129/21 1738 Devon Quarter Session Records Devon Record Office The trade of transporting convicts was common from the west country ports in the 18th century as a return cargo for the tobacco trades, Bideford being one of the major centres for such imports.

Career Hirata made his debut in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) on August 26, 1978, against Yoshiaki Fujiwara. In November 1982, he left on an overseas training expedition to Mexico, and later Canada, where in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling he would create the famous Super Strong Machine persona, as well as use a First Nations gimmick as Sonny Two Rivers (billed as the son of Billy Two Rivers, an actual First Nations chief). In April 1986, he left NJPW with Riki Choshu for rival wrestling promotion, All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). In June 1987, he returned to NJPW and would soon capture the IWGP Tag Team Championship on three separate occasions with George Takano, Hiro Saito, and Shinya Hashimoto as his tag team partners. In the fall of 1986, the World Wrestling Federation introduced a stable of wrestlers called The Machines -- \\"The Giant Machine\\" (Andr√© the Giant), \\"Big Machine\\" (Blackjack Mulligan), and \\"Super Machine\\" (Bill Eadie) -- based on Junji Hirata's popular Super Strong Machine gimmick. In 1984, Hirata had tried to make his own \\"Machines\\" stable with Korean wrestler Yang Seung-hi and veteran Yasu Fuji as Strong Machine #2 and Strong Machine #3 respectively, but this version of the stable did not have the exposure or push of their American counterparts.cagematch.net - Strong Machine matches Hirata briefly turned face and became \\"Super\\" Strong Machine, feuding with his former partners. When Hirata left for Japan Pro, Fuji retired and Yang went back to South Korea. In December 1994, after Masahiro Chono turned on him, he finally unmasked, dropping the Super Strong Machine character and wrestling under his real name. He revived the Super Strong Machine persona for the first time in six years in October 2000, having a brief feud with T2000 Machine (Tatsutoshi Goto). In 2005, Hirata, as the masked persona of Black Strong Machine, became a regular fixture on NJPW shows reconciled with Chono and part of his Black New Japan stable. He also had a brief stint in AJPW as Super Love Machine, the leader of the Love Machines, this time taking as partners Arashi as Love Machine Storm and Gran Hamada as Mini Love Machine. Whatever role he plays, Junji Hirata is a very respected veteran and is well liked by wrestlers, officials, and fans alike. In the late 2000s, Hirata was a founding member of the Legend and Seigigun stables. He wrestled his to date final match on April 2, 2014, at Wataru Inoue's retirement event. He now works as a trainer at the NJPW dojo. On April 12, 2018, it was announced that he was retiring from active competition. His retirement ceremony was held on June 19 at Korakuen Hall.

His reign was mostly marked by heavy conflict among nation's political factions on various issues, especially on funeral issues. Biography =Background= Hyeonjong was born in 1641 as the first son of King Hyojong as Yi Yeon, while his father was still in China as captive of Manchu Qing Dynasty; thus he was born at Shenyang, the Manchu capital before Qing Dynasty officially move its capital to Beijing after defeating Ming Dynasty in 1644. He returned to Korea in 1645 along with his father and became Crown Prince in 1651. =Conflict About Hyojong's Funeral (Yesong Controversy)= When King Hyojong died in 1659, Hyeonjong succeeded his father as the ruler of Joseon. The first issue during his reign was about his predecessor's funeral; The conservative Westerners faction and the liberal Southerners faction squared off about how long Queen Jangryeol, King Injo's second wife, should have to wear funeral garment according to the Confucian form of funeral. The Westerners, headed by Song Si- yeol, contended that she needed to wear the funeral garment for only a year, while the Southerners and their leader Heo Jeok wanted a 3-year period. This conflict arose because there was no previous record about Confucian funeral requirements when somebody's second stepson who actually succeeded the family line dies. The Westerners wanted to follow the custom for a second stepson, while the Southerners thought Hyojong deserved a 3-year funeral since he actually succeeded King Injo in the royal line. The final decision was up to young King Hyeonjong; He chose to enforce a 1-year period, which would keep the Westerners as the major faction. However, at the same time, Hyeonjong did not remove Heo Jeok from office of Prime Minister, in order to prevent the Westerners from threatening royal authority. The feud between the Southerners and the Westerners was highly intensified by the funeral issue; Earlier, after the fall of the Greater Northerners in 1623, the Westerners and the Southerners formed political alliance under the leadership of King Hyojong, but on the funeral issue, both sides were intractable, leading to a greater probability of confrontations. Hyeonjong at first maintained the balance of two factions by compromising between them with the 1-year period of the Westerners and keeping Southerner Heo Jeok as Prime Minister, and the two factions resumed a peaceful relationship temporarily. However, in 1674, when Queen Inseon, Hyojong's wife and Hyeonjong's mother, died, the funeral issue came up again; The Southerners wanted Queen Jaeui to wear the funeral garment for one year while the Westerners preferred a nine-month period. This time Hyeonjong listened to the Southerners and selected their method, making the Southerners faction as major political faction over the Westerners. The funeral controversy continued even after Hyeonjong died in 1675, and it was settled by Hyeonjong's successor King Sukjong, who banned all debate about the issue. The controversy even affected the publishing of official history of Hyeonjong's era; at first it was written chiefly by Southerners but later it was revised by Westerner historians. =Achievements= In 1666, during Hyeonjong's reign, after more than thirteen years of captivity, Dutchman Hendrick Hamel left Korea and returned to the Netherlands, where he wrote a book about Joseon Dynasty and his experience in Korea, which introduced the kingdom to many Europeans. Hyeonjong stopped Hyojong's insuperable plan of northern conquest, since the Joseon had become a tributary state of the Qing Dynasty. Furthermore, after a series victories against the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty had become too mighty to resist. However, Hyeonjong continued Hyojong's military expansion and reconstruction of the nation which was devastated from the Seven-Year War and two Manchu invasions. He also encouraged astronomy and printing. He also legally banned the marriage between relatives and also between those who share the same surnames. He died in 1674, and was succeeded by his son Sukjong.

They lie within the bounds of the Galloway Forest Park, an area of some of largely uninhabited wild land, managed by Forestry and Land Scotland. The unusual place names reflect a mixture of the Old Norse and Scottish Gaelic languages and hint at the range of influences which have acted on society within the area over the centuries. Looking north east over the Silver Flowe from Craignaw in the Dungeon hills with Corserine (just right of centre), and Carlin's Cairn (left of centre) on the Rhinns of Kells ridge - winter. The loch in the foreground is Long Loch of the Dungeon. Looking south west from Buchan Hill down Loch Trool. Location The location of Galloway has been described as follows, \\"Galloway is contained by sea to the west (North Channel) and south (Solway Firth), the \\"Galloway Hills\\" to the north, and the River Nith to the east\\".Galloway So if we were to say \\"The hills of Galloway\\" we would be including all the hills within this area; but as the first sentence implies, the \\"Galloway Hills\\" Ordnance Survey Map Sheet 77 Dalmellington and New Galloway is usually taken to mean a collection of ranges which lie mainly south of Loch Doon and which are not constrained by political boundaries. The boundary between Dumfries and Galloway Region and Ayrshire runs west to east over Kirriereoch hill, drops south of Mullwharchar to the shores of Loch Enoch, before heading northwards up the east shore of Loch Doon, and so runs more or less through what might well be considered the heart of the Galloway hills ‚Äì around Loch Enoch. =Northern and western boundaries= The northern limit of this hill area is around the small towns of Dalmellington and Straiton, both in Ayrshire. The B741 runs on an east/west line between these two towns on its way to the town of Girvan on the Firth of Clyde. The B741 could therefore be taken as the northern limit of the Galloway Hills area. From Straiton a minor road runs south by Stinchar Bridge The Stinchar Valley through the northwest corner of these hills to meet another minor road which runs from Glentrool village northwards towards Girvan and Maybole. This latter road forms the western boundary of the Galloway Hills. It follows the valley of Water of Minnoch Fishing on Rivers Cree and Water of Minnoch and for most of its length it passes through the extensive forestry plantations which lie to the west of the hills. =Eastern boundary= The A713 (Castle Douglas to Ayr road) forms the eastern boundary of these hills. As it heads south from Dalmellington it passes through the valley known as the GlenkensThe Glenkens which separates the Galloway Hills from the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills hills to the east. There is an extensive hydro-electric scheme (commissioned 1935/36) with several dams and power stations that runs down through the GlenkensInternational Water Power Magazine to end at Tongland Power Station Galloway Hydros Visitors Centre near Kirkcudbright. The A713 passes through Carsphairn on the Water of Deuch and St John's Town of Dalry on Water of Ken and also close to New Galloway at Kenbridge,Ken Bridge Hotel at the northern end of Loch Ken. From New Galloway the A712 passes through the hills to Newton Stewart. This road passes Clatteringshaws Reservoir, the Queen's Way,Travel Scotland Dunkitterick Cottage (the birthplace of Alexander Murray), a deer range, a wild goat park and Murray's Monument. =Southern boundary= Grey Man of the Merrick. For most users of these hills, \\"the Galloway Hills\\" would mean the ranges which lie north of a line running eastwards along the north shores of Loch Trool, Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws Reservoir. This for them would be the notional true heartland of the Galloway Hills. The Southern Upland Way and the National Cycle Network Route Number Seven travel along this line. A slightly looser use of the phrase Galloway Hills would include the ranges which lie to the south of that line. =Outlying ranges to the south= To the south of the A712, east of Clatteringshaws Reservoir is a hill called Cairnsmore of Dee or Black Craig of Dee (493 metres) which offers excellent views from the top over Clatteringshaws into the heart of the Galloway Hills. To the south of Murray's Monument is a range of hills around Cairnsmore of Fleet. The top of Cairnsmore of Fleet is over 2 km in length running almost north-south and it has tops at either end. To the south of this again is a group of small coastal hills around Cairnharrow just to the west of Gatehouse of Fleet. Immediately beyond that is the A75 road running close to the shore of the Solway Firth. Hills named Cairnsmore Besides the two Cairnsmore Hills just mentioned there is a third \\"Cairnsmore\\" acting as a prominent sentinel around the borders of the Galloway hills. This is Cairnsmore of Carsphairn which lies some 5 km to the north east of Carsphairn and is the prominent hill to the east of the Rhinns of Kells ridge. Access roads * Some 2 km south of Dalmellington on the A713 s a forestry toll road which leads down the west side of Loch Doon, passing the reconstructed Loch Doon Castle Gazetteer for Scotland and emerging at Stinchar Bridge, passing close to Loch Riecawr and Loch Bradan. The Barr to Loch Doon Cycle Route Ayrshire Paths uses this forest road. * From Glentrool village there is a minor single track road that foes eastward to Bruce's Stone on the northern side of Loch Trool, a distance of some 6 km. The road stops here for vehicle traffic but the N7 National Cycle Network Route carries on from there over to Clatteringshaws. * Cars can be taken as far as Craigencallie (Ordnance Survey ref. NX503780) which lies about half way between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. Access to the single track road there is just west of the dam at Clatteringshaws Reservoir on the A712. Three ridges As mentioned above the heartland of the Galloway Hills lies to the north of Loch Trool and many excellent walks into that particularly wild remote territory start from the extensive car park by Bruce's Stone. There are three ridges which run northwards from the Loch Trool/Loch Dee/Clatteringshaws area - The Awful Hand on the west, the Rhinns of Kells to the east, and the Dungeon Hills in between. =Range of the Awful Hand= Dungeon Hills and Awful Hand from the Saddle between Millfire and Corserine in the Rhinns of Kells. 01 Dungeon Hill - 02 Merrick - 03 Little Spear of Merrick - 04 Kirriereoch - 05 Mullwharchar - 06 Tarfessock - 07 Shalloch on Minnoch - 08 Hoodens Hill. Taking the 'Awful Hand' from north to south are the following tops Shalloch on Minnoch, Tarfessock, Kirriereoch Hill, Merrick and Benyellary. Merrick is the highest hill in the south of Scotland though at less than 3000 feet it is not a Munro. These five hills have ridges running off them to the west making the hand shape, Benyellary being the thumb. This hand is best seen from near Waterhead on Minnoch as you head south from Stinchar Bridge towards Glentrool village. The Awful Hand ridge is 9 km in length as the crow flies; from the top of Shalloch on Minnoch to the top of Benyellary. Although sounding quite short, there are some stiff climbs along the route, especially around Kirriereoch Hill and the Merrick. Walkers also have at least a 3 km walk in to the two terminal tops from any road. =Rhinns of Kells= Rhinns of Kells Range from Cairnsmore of Carsphairn Hills 01 Meikle Millyea - 02 Milldown - 03 Millfire - 04 Corserine - 05 Craigrine - 06 Carlin's Cairn - 07 Cairnsgarroch - 08 Meaul - 09 Bow - 10 Coran of Portmark - 11 Black Craig. Taking the Rhinns of Kells from north to south we start on Black Craig on the east bank of Loch Doon, followed by Coran of Portmark, Meaul, Carlin's Cairn, Corserine, Millfire, Milldown, Meikle Millyea, Little Millyea and Darrou. Darrou lies about half way between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. The Rhinns of Kells is 15.5 km as the crow flies from Black Craig to Darrou and the ridge has a double curve on it making it somewhat longer than that. It tends to be a gently undulating ridge along its length making for relatively easy walking. =Dungeon Hills= Lochs Enoch, Arron and Neldricken, the Dungeon hills and the Rhinns of Kells from Merrick. 01 Milldown - 02 Meikle Millyea - 03 Cairnsmore of Dee - 04 Dungeon Hill - 05 Loch Enoch - 06 Nick of the Dungeon - 07 Craig Neldricken - 08 Craignaw - 09 Clatteringshaws Reservoir - 10 Loch Arron - 11 Loch Neldricken - 12 Craiglee Taking the Dungeon Hills from north to south, Craigmawhannal is just south of the south end of Loch Doon, followed by, Hoodens Hill, Mullwharchar, Dungeon Hill, Craignairny, Craignaw, Snibe Hill and Craiglee. Craiglee is to an extent an outlier from the main ridge lying as it does at the eastern end of the Rig of the Jarkness which runs east to west. Craiglee is just north of Loch Dee. The 'Dungeons' are 11 km from the top of Craigmawhannal to the top of Craiglee as the crow flies. None of these hills get to the same heights as some hills on the other two ridges. However, apart from Mullwharchar they are much more rocky and rugged and are therefore popular with climbers and scramblers. A planning application was made in January 1978 to Kyle and Carrick District Council by the UKAEA to test drill on Mullwharchar for the purpose of dumping nuclear waste. On 24 October 1978, the Council rejected the application after considerable local protest.Scottish Hills Forums Between the ridges There is relatively low ground between the Dungeons ridge and the other two ridges on either side of it and this lower ground passes through the whole hill area from north to south forming two corridors through the hills. However, the surface of the highest loch in the corridor to the west of the Dungeons, Loch Enoch, is actually around 490 metres above sea level. With Loch Trool being about 70 m above sea level, this corridor rises significantly as it passes for about 5 km between the hills on either side. The surface of Dry Loch of the Dungeon, the highest loch to the east of the Dungeons is around 330 metres above sea level and most of the Silver Flowe immediately to the south of it lies fairly level at about the 270 metres mark all the way back south to Loch Dee (around 225 metres above sea level). The explanation for this is that the Silver Flowe is a floating or blanket bog and is consequently flat in nature. =Lochs between the Awful Hand and the Dungeons= View over Lochs Arron, Neldricken and Valley to Minnigaff Hills 01 Craignaw - 02 Craig Neldricken - 03 Loch Arron - 04 Loch Neldricken - 05 Craiglee - 06 Millfore - 07 Cairnsmore of Fleet - 08 White Hill - 09 Curleywee - 10 Bennanbrack - 11 Lamachan - 12 Glenhead Lochs - 13 Rig of the Jarkness - 14 Loch Valley - 15 Buchan Ridge. There are two burns which feed into the eastern end of Loch Trool on its northern shore, the Buchan Burn (the more westerly) and the Gairland Burn, separated by a 3 km long ridge which runs north from Buchan Hill just north of Loch Trool to Craig Neldricken immediately south of Loch Enoch - the Buchan Ridge. It is quite possible to use the Buchan Burn route to get to Loch Enoch, passing the Grey Man of the Merrick, on the left before Loch Enoch (OS ref. NX427842). The more popular route however, because of the scenic interest, is the Gairland Burn path which passes Loch Valley, Loch Neldricken and Loch Arron before reaching Loch Enoch. This is often called the \\"Loch's Route onto The Merrick\\" - though involves a 350-metre climb up Redstone Rig from Loch Enoch to the Merrick. On the west side of Loch Neldricken is \\"Murder Hole\\", which name refers to an incident in Samuel Crockett's novel \\"The Raiders\\" - though it is claimed that the real murder hole is near Rowantree Bridge (OS Ref NX354907) on the Water of Minnoch where the bodies of waylaid, murdered travellers were dumped.Temperley, Alan (1979) Tales of Galloway p129 footnote. East of Loch Neldricken, access to Loch Enoch is gained by the Wolf Slock. Both of these latter named places figure prominently in the Crockett novel. The sharp granite sand on the beaches of Loch Enoch itself was at one time collected and sold for sharpening knives and scythes.McBain The Merrick and the Neighbouring Hills (1980 edition) p139 In McBain's book \\"The Merrick and Neighbouring Hills\\" there is a description of how McBain tried to find the depth of Loch Enoch by cutting a series of holes on its icy surface and dropping a weighted line into it - quite alone when he did so. He worked out a depth of 105 feet at what he reckoned was the deepest point.McBain pp146-154 McBain was an intrepid hill walker/climber who was much devoted to these hills and his book exudes his love for the wild places. =Silver Flowe= Silver Flowe from Dungeon Hill. Backhill of Bush is behind the trees on the left edge of the picture. The loch in the foreground is Long Loch of the Dungeon and the loch in the distance by the right edge of the picture is Loch Dee. Meikle Millyea is on the left edge leading down to Little Millyea and Darrou as the Rhinns of Kells ridge descends into the gap between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. Ralph Furlow Monument with Loch Dungeon and Meikle Millyea. The Silver Flowe is a national nature reserve with a Blanket bog of international importance. It is part of the Merrick Kells Biosphere ReserveUNESC-MAB Biospheres Reserves Directory and is a Ramsar site List of Ramsar Sites in Scotland for the quality of its peatlands and wetlands. The reserve is owned by Forest Enterprise but is managed through a lease by Scottish Natural Heritage. =Backhill of Bush= Today Backhill of Bush is open as a bothy, having been renovated after a period of closure due to vandalism. Until around 1950 it was still in use as the home of a shepherd (or \\"Hird\\" in local parlance) working a part of the land known as the Dungeon of Buchan and was reckoned to be the loneliest such outpost in Galloway with the Silver Flowe to the west and the Rhinns of Kells to the east. Soon after this the land was taken over by the Forestry Commission and the sheep grazings became dense forest, but not before the death of a 17-year-old shepherd called Ralph Furlow, an employee of the Department of Agriculture, whose job it was to cross the Rhinns of Kells to tend to the sheep still in the Dungeon area. On 27 January 1954 he was overwhelmed in a snow storm and his death is commemorated by a monument just below Millfire on its east side.McFadzean Dave (2004) Tales 'o the Back Buss pp. 65-67 =Access into the heart of the Galloway Hills from the East and West= The route Ralph Furlow would have used to cross the Rhinns was that used by the former residents of Back Hill - going over the saddle between Corserine and Millfire (OS. Ref NX516863). In earlier times a funeral party taking a \\"hird's\\" wife's dead body over the Rhinns was caught in a snowstorm in this saddle and the body had to be left there for several days.McFadzean p24 Heading west from Back Hill for the Loch Enoch area the route taken was up the Nick of the Dungeon, a steep boulder-strewn climb west of the watery pools of the Silver Flowe. Habitation in the Galloway Hills There are the remains of several other former buildings scattered around the Galloway hills area; notably at Glenhead (NX433800) close to the Southern Upland Way for example, and at Culsharg (NX416822) on the \\"tourist route\\" from Bruce's Stone to the Merrick. The latter can still be used as something of a shelter in bad weather, though it is far from MBA bothy standard. Buildings still in use are to be found around the periphery of the Galloway hills heartland but apart from forest tracks, there are neither public roads nor buildings in use in the heartland itself. Minnigaff Hills The Minnigaff Hills lie just south of the east end of Loch Trool and they stretch to the shores of Clatteringshaws Reservoir. Their southern boundary is the A712 New Galloway to Newton Stewart road. The battle which Bruce's Stone commemorates was actually fought (in 1307) at the south east end of Loch Trool where Muldonnoch falls steeply into it. South east of Muldonnoch is Lamachan Hill, the south west ridge of which leads to Larg Hill (676 metres) whilst another runs east over Bennanbrack to Curleywee. White Hill is 1.5km north of Curleywee whilst its 3.5km long southern ridge drop to the top of Black Benwee. Some 2 km east of Loch Dee a ridge of hills runs from just south of Darrou in a south westerly direction; these hills are really a continuation of the line of the Rhinns of Kells. From north to south the hills are Cairngarroch, Cairnbaber, Millfore and Drigmorn Hill. There is also a small range of hills just to the west of Clatteringshaws Reservoir. On Darnaw, the highest of these hills, there is a monument to those who died here in an air crash on 2 February 1937.Air Crash Sites Scotland Air crash sites A frozen waterfall in the Galloway Hills. Besides the air crash site just mentioned on Darnaw there are many more crash sites (some with monuments) in the Galloway hills area. There is a monument on Cairnsmore of Fleet which lists 9 aircraft which have crashed there. There is a monument on Craignaw to the pilots of an F-111 which crashed there on 19 December 1979. During World War II, Dumfries and several other places in south west Scotland were heavily involved in the training of pilots etc. for the war effort and many of the crash sites date from this era.Dumfries Aviation MuseumList of air crash sites in Galloway Galloway Forest Park The whole area of hills falls within Galloway Forest Park, an area of of mixed landscape with three visitors' centres and offering many recreational facilities. On 15 November 2009, the park became the first Dark Sky Park in the United Kingdom. Galloway Hills in Scottish history Like the Western Isles and the Northern Isles, Galloway had a long history under the Lords of Galloway (from the early 12th century until 1234) of being largely independent of the Scottish crown. Going back beyond that there is thought to have been a kingdom of Galloway perhaps going back to the aftermath of the expulsion of the Vikings from Dublin in 902 and the subsequent loss of control by the former Northumbrian masters of Galloway.Oram, Richard (2000) The Lordship of Galloway p. 1 Galloway was long regarded as a wild and lawless place - somewhat other from the mainstream of Scottish culture, which was as much as anything to do with its remoteness and inaccessibility. The Galloway hills played an important part in this image especially as at various points in history it was a place of refuge for fugitives who did not fit into, or defied, the power structure of their times. =\\"Cradle of Independence\\" - A king as a fugitive= View from Eschoncan over part of the car park at Bruce's Stone Glentrool to the scene of the Battle of Glentrool (1307) at Steps of Trool (marked with a blue asterisk) on the far side of Loch Trool with Mulldonoch beyond. Bruce's Stone can be seen right of centre in the foreground (small red asterisk below it) Bruce's Stone Glentrool. Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland on 25 March 1306 little more than a month after he had been involved at Dumfries in the murder of John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, otherwise known as the Red Comyn, (a serious rival for the kingship of Scotland, as his mother was Eleanor Balliol who was the eldest daughter of John I de Balliol) .Dumfries Museum - Bruce and Comyn Another branch of the Comyn family at his time was that of John Comyn Earl of Buchan. His father Alexander had been Sheriff of Wigtown (1263‚Äì1266) and a Guardian of Scotland (1286‚Äì89), and they held land in the south west of Scotland before being granted the lands in Buchan - which explains why there are place names with Buchan in them in the Galloway hills area like Buchan Hill and Dungeon of Buchan. Bruce's army lost to Edward I's forces at the Battle of Methven in June 1306 and he became a fugitive hunted not only by the occupying forces of Edward but also by the Comyns and the Balliols. He escaped to Rathlin Island off the Irish coast but by February 1307 he was back in Scotland, in the Galloway hills, with a tiny handful of followers and totally encircled by his enemies - a king hunted like an animal. However, following a successful early raid on the English forces at Raploch Moss near Clatteringshaws, he had his first victory against the English forces at the battle of Glen Trool. Though this was probably more of a minor skirmish in the guerrilla mode of William Wallace, it was important from a propaganda point of view in the recruitment of men to Bruce's cause. In 1929 on the 600th anniversary of Bruce's death, Bruce's Stone was placed high above the northern shore of Loch Trool from where legend has it that he had commanded the ambush which took place on the Steps of Trool on the other side of the loch. He lived for some 3 months as a fugitive in these hills before he was able to break out of his confinement and go on eventually to the much more significant victory at Bannockburn in 1314 which gave Scotland some relief in the first War of Independence and the near subjugation to the English Crown which had ensued after the death of King Alexander III on 19 March 1286. Robert the Bruce's brother Edward who was later to become High King of Ireland had long since carried out a successful campaign against the Comyn/Balliol faction in the south west of Scotland before Bannockburn. =Covenanting fugitives= Through most of the 17th century the Presbyterian Church in Scotland struggled against the will of the Stewart Kings in their attempts to impose Anglican and even (with James II) Catholic practices in the Scottish Church. The Presbyterian Church claimed that every man was equal in the eyes of God, could read and understand the Bible for himself and therefore needed no hierarchical form of priesthood, especially one which was appointed under the patronage of the most powerful people in the land, to act between them and their God. The covenanters believed that the reformation settlement in England had simply replaced the power of the Pope over the church with the power of the king over it and they would not have their religious freedom laid down for them by the crown. In some ways their principles were political harbingers on the path towards later principles of democratic forms of government and were seen at the time as dangerous sedition by kings who still believed in the Divine right of kings. The National Covenant was drawn up in 1638 and it is from this that the Covenanters take their name - with reference beyond that to the Covenants of the Bible.The South West of Scotland was a particular hot bed of resistance to the will of the kings in religious matters and over time both sides in this conflict went to extreme ends to have their way. =Killing Times= The full weight of the state was brought against the fanatical religious idealism of the Covenanters; most of whom were ordinary people. Over a protracted period of time they were hunted in the hills of Galloway much as Bruce had been and were prepared to risk summary and brutal execution for their beliefs if caught. Those suffering this fate were seen by their fellows as martyrs for the cause. Like the Bruce they were idealistic fugitives in the Galloway hills fighting for what they believed in and there were several battles between the covenanters and the crown forces in various parts of Scotland. In their case however their struggles to survive in these hills and practice their beliefs there through conventicles Dumfries Museums on Covenanting are counted in years rather than months. Eighty two persons were summarily killed by the troops during the Killing Time (1684‚Äì85). Since these are only the ones which were witnessed and recorded the numbers could be much more. \\"All over the more desolate parts the Covenanters were being massacred by the soldiers and their bodies left to rot on the heather where they fell. No records were kept of such killings; the victims were simply regarded as 'missing' for none of their relatives or friends knew how or where they had died. For many years after the killing times shepherds were continually finding on hills and moors the bleached skeletons of covenanters who had been killed in this way\\".Robertson The Story of Galloway p.167 The matter was not resolved until after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when under William of Orange presbyterianism was finally established as the faith of most Scots and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland was accepted by the authorities as the established church although, though even he, a fellow Calvinist, found the more fanatical Presbyterians hard to handle. In the 18th century the stonemason Robert Paterson devoted his life to going round the country restoring the monuments of the covenanting martyrs and Walter Scott used this real life character as the model for \\"Old Mortality\\". The Galloway author S.R.Crockett wrote several covenanting novels set around the Galloway Hills, including The Men of the Moss Hags, and Silver Sand. =Smugglers and gypsies= The 18th century was the heyday of smuggling along the Solway coastTemperley p.271 \\\\- sitting as it does only around 20 miles (30 km) from the Isle of Man, the pathway for most contraband goods. The Galloway hills offered a refuge for these far from idealistic lawless rogues and ruffians - somewhere to retreat to in times of trouble and as a safe route for the strings of up to 200 laden horses which carried their goods to Glasgow or Edinburgh. \\"During the early 18th century Galloway was infested with gypsies,and it was no accident that Sir Walter Scott should have introduced Meg Merrilees and her tribe into his novel 'Guy Mannering' which is set in the Stewartry.\\"Russell The Book of Galloway p. 185 Gypsy or \\"Tinkler\\" clans were heavily involved in the trafficking side of smuggling - getting the contraband to its market. The most notorious of these gypsy smugglers was Billy Marshall (King of the Gypsies) who is said to have fought at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 at the age of 18 and died on 28 November 1792 ‚Äì 120 years old and having married 17 times.Temperley Tales of Galloway pp. 16-27 He was also one of the leaders of the Levellers (not to be confused with the Levellers in England). The actions of the Galloway Levellers have been described as the \\"most significant agrarian rebellion\\" in 18th century Scotland. They knocked down dykes during the night as quickly as enclosing landlords built them during the day.Russell The Book of Galloway pp. 51-52 The Galloway author S.R.Crockett uses the Levellers Rebellion as a sub-plot in his novel The Dark o' the Moon, which is set in the Galloway Hills, especially around the Dungeon Range. Crockett wrote several other stories of Galloway smugglers and gypsies http://www.gallowayraiders.co.uk Another story from west Galloway which helped to give an extra edge to the picture of lawlessness in the area was the legend of the extensive cannibal family of Sawney Bean. Scotland's National Bard Robert Burns was an excise man in eastern Galloway at the time of his death in 1796.

In 1950, Tuck was working for Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, who was running for a seat in the U.S. Senate against Nixon. In a 1973 Time magazine article, Tuck stated, \\"There was an absent-minded professor who knew I was in politics and forgot the rest. He asked me to advance a Nixon visit.\\" Tuck agreed and launched his first prank against Nixon. He rented a big auditorium, invited only a small number of people, and gave a long-winded speech to introduce the candidate. When Nixon came on stage, Tuck asked him to speak about the International Monetary Fund. When the speech was over, Nixon asked Tuck his name and told him, \\"Dick Tuck, you've made your last advance.\\" Tuck's most famous prank against Nixon is known as \\"the Chinatown Caper\\". During his campaign for Governor of California in 1962, Nixon visited Chinatown in Los Angeles. At the campaign stop, a backdrop of children holding \\"welcome\\" signs in English and Chinese was set up. As Nixon spoke, an elder from the community whispered that one of the signs in Chinese said, \\"What about the Hughes loan?\\" The sign was a reference to an unsecured $205,000 loan that Howard Hughes had made to Nixon's brother, Donald. Nixon grabbed a sign and, on camera, ripped it up. Later, Tuck learned, to his chagrin, that the Chinese characters actually spelled out \\"What about the huge loan?\\" After the first Kennedy‚ÄìNixon debate in 1960, Tuck hired an elderly woman who put on a Nixon button and embraced the candidate in front of TV cameras. She said, \\"Don't worry, son! He beat you last night, but you'll get him next time.\\" Tuck is credited with waving a train out of the station while Nixon was still speaking. Tuck at times took responsibility, claiming \\"Nixon's up there talking and suddenly the crowd goes out like the morning tide\\" while at other times he denied it entirely saying that he did borrow a conductor's hat and wave to the engineer, but the train stayed put. In 1968, Tuck utilized Republican nominee Nixon's own campaign slogan against him; he hired a heavily pregnant black woman to wander around a Nixon rally in a predominantly white area, wearing a T-shirt that read, \\"Nixon's the One!\\" Political career In 1966, Tuck ran for the California State Senate. He opened his campaign with a press conference at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, claiming that just because people had died doesn't mean they don't still have (voting) rights. Hearing of Tuck's entry as a candidate, Richard Nixon sent him a congratulatory telegram, including an offer to campaign for him, despite Tuck's being a Democrat. Dick Tuck designed his campaign billboards to read, in small print, \\"Dick\\", and in much larger lettering, \\"Tuck\\". The names were printed twice, piggy-backed one above the other. On the eve of the election he drove around the area and painted an extra line on the upper \\"Tuck\\" on the billboards. This converted the T in his name to an F so that passersby would see a profane phrase. Tuck said he thought voters would think his opponent had done this and he'd \\"get the sympathy vote\\" with this tactic. In a field of eight candidates for the Democratic nomination, Tuck finished third with 5211 votes (almost 10%), losing to future Congressman George E. Danielson.County of Los Angeles, Results of the Official Canvass of Primary Election, June 7, 1966. Archive.org copy, results on page 345 As the ballot totals piled against him on election night, the candidate was asked his reaction. Referring to his earlier cemetery speech, Tuck quipped, \\"Just wait till the dead vote comes in.\\" When defeat became inevitable, Tuck made the now notorious statement, \\"The people have spoken, the bastards.\\" Tuck was a key adviser in Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. After Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles, he rode in Kennedy's ambulance as the mortally wounded candidate was rushed to the hospital. Tuck claimed that the Watergate break-in was an attempt to access information held by Larry O'Brien, chair of the Democratic National Committee about the Hughes-Nixon relationship. Tuck was a campaign operative, and claimed he was never malicious in his political pranks. Richard Nixon obsessed about Tuck, however, as recorded in his presidential tapes. But Nixon also admired Tuck, comparing the dirty tricks committed by his staffer Donald Segretti unfavorably to the intelligence and wit behind some of Tuck's political pranks. After the Watergate scandal became public, H. R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff under Nixon, saw Tuck in the Capitol. Haldeman reportedly turned to Tuck and said, \\"You started all of this.\\" Tuck replied, \\"Yeah, Bob, but you guys ran it into the ground.\\" Tuck also served briefly as political editor/adviser to the National Lampoon magazine. Controversy Virtually every great prank Dick Tuck claimed to have pulled or was associated with has been disputed in some way. Tuck often confessed and later denied his actions. He admitted to making up some of his pranks to author Neil Steinberg, who covered Tuck in his 1992 book If At All Possible, Involve A Cow: The Book of College Pranks. However, Tuck is mentioned in an October 1972 Oval Office tape when Nixon, speaking to H. R. Haldeman about the Segretti disclosures, said, \\"Dick Tuck did that to me. Let's get out what Dick Tuck did!\\" Nixon went on to describe egged limousines and staged violence in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. According to a 1997 article in The Washington Post by reporter Karl Vick, Nixon was not the first to confuse Tuck's record with Tuck's legend. White House tapes also record Nixon speaking with John Connally on October 17, 1972, saying Tuck had all of Goldwater's speeches in hand before they were spoken because, Nixon presumed, Tuck had an informant in the Goldwater campaign. Tuck denied this, but his reputation earned him the nickname \\"Democratic pixie of the 1964 race.\\" Retirement and death In the later years of his life, Tuck lived in retirement in Tucson, Arizona. Tuck died on May 28, 2018, at an assisted living facility in Tucson. He was 94.'Dick Tucker, Democratic prankster who targeted Nixon, dies at 94,' The Washington Post, Tom Hamburger, May 29, 2018  Quotes  \\"I didn't hide what I did. I never tried to be malicious.

It originally opened in 1939 as the home of the minor league St. Joseph Saints. It has a seating capacity of 3,600 and is located at 2600 SW Parkway in St. Joseph. History Phil Welch Stadium opened as home of the St. Joseph Saints in 1939. The Saints had various other monikers and were a member of the Western Association (1939-1941, 1946-1951, 1953-1954). They were an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals (1946-1951, 1953), the Chicago Cubs (1939-1940), St. Louis Browns (1941) and the New York Yankees (1954). Hall of Fame players like Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays played games there while rising through the ranks. St, Joseph won three Western Association Championships playing at Phil Welch Stadium. They won the championship in 1940 under Keith Frazier and the last two under Robert Stanton and Harold Olt in 1947 and 1948. In 1939, Hall of Fame member Dizzy Dean debuted his professional career with St. Joseph, going 17-8 in 32 games with a 3.69 ERA. In 1949, Hall of Fame member Earl Weaver played for the Saints. Phil Welch Stadium was the home from 2006 to 2007 to the St. Joe Blacksnakes, a minor-league team competing in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Since 2009 the stadium has been the home of the Saint Joseph Mustangs, a collegiate summer baseball team competing in the M.I.N.K. League. Phil Welch was also the home park of the Missouri Western State University Griffons until the 2011 season. Stadium dimensions are 320-420-320 (left to right).

Subsequently, MAP kinase kinase activates MAP kinase. Several types of MAPKKK can exist but are mainly characterized by the MAP kinases they activate. MAPKKKs are stimulated by a large range of stimuli, primarily environmental and intracellular stressors. MAPKKK is responsible for various cell functions such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. The duration and intensity of signals determine which pathway ensues. Additionally, the use of protein scaffolds helps to place the MAPKKK in close proximity with its substrate to allow for a reaction. Lastly, because MAPKKK is involved in a series of several pathways, it has been used as a therapeutic target for cancer, amyloidosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. In humans, there are at least 19 genes which encode MAP kinase kinase kinases: * MAP3K1 (aka MEKK1) * MAP3K2 (aka MEKK2) * MAP3K3 (aka MEKK3) * MAP3K4 (aka MEKK4) * MAP3K5 (aka ASK1) * MAP3K6 (aka ASK2) * MAP3K7 (aka MEKK7) (aka TAK1) * MAP3K8 (aka TPL2 or Tpl2) * MAP3K9 * MAP3K10 * MAP3K11 (aka MEKK11) (aka MLK3) * MAP3K12 (aka MUK) * MAP3K13 (aka LZK) * MAP3K14 * MAP3K15 * MAP3K16 (aka TAO1 or TAOK1) * MAP3K17 (aka TAO2 or TAOK2) * RAF1 * BRAF * ARAF * ZAK (aka MLTK) Classes of MAPKKK and their functions Several classes of MAPKKK exist, and all of them are upstream of MAP kinases. There are three main classes of MAP Kinases and are regulated by their respective MAPKKKs. These MAP kinases include the extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAP kinase. The ERKs are regulated by the Raf family of MAPKKKs and are responsible for cell growth, differentiation, and meiosis. Perhaps the best characterized MAP3K are the members of the oncogenic RAF family (RAF1, BRAF, ARAF), which are effectors of mitogenic ras signaling and which activate the ERK1/2 (MAPK3/MAPK1) pathway, through activation of MEK1(MAP2K1) and MEK2(MAP2K2). The JNKs are regulated by the MEKK 1/4, MLK 2/3, and ASK 1 MAPKKKs. The p38 MAPK is regulated by MEKK 1-4 and TAO 1/2 families of MAPKKKs and is responsible for inflammation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell cycle regulation. The determination for what cascade is followed is based upon the type of signal, the strength of binding, and the length of binding. MEKK1 activates MAPK8/JNK by phosphorylation of its activator SEK1(MAP2K4). MAP3K3 directly regulates the MAPK8/JNK and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways by activating SEK and MEK1/2 respectively; it does not regulate the p38 pathway. MAP3K7(TAK1) participates in regulation of transcription by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Activation and deactivation of MAPKKK The most upstream stimuli that activate MAPKKK is either stress or growth factors. This includes mitogens, inflammatory cytokines, ER stress, oxidative stress, UV radiation, and DNA damage. Most MAPKKKs are activated through GPCR's where the signal from the stimuli binds to the GPCR and the GTPase activity of the g-protein activates the downstream MAPKKK. Other mechanisms for MAPKKK do exist. For instance, the MAPKKK ASK-1 is activated by a receptor-tyrosine kinase specific for a tumor necrosis factor. Since MAPKKK are activated through the addition of a phosphates group on a serine/threonine residue, they are deactivated by a phosphatase. A common phosphatase used in ASK-1 regulation is PP5. MAPKKKs contain a docking domain which is different from their active site that allows them to contact another substrate. Additionally, several scaffolds are used in the MAPKKK cascade in order to ensure that a specific cascade is used. These scaffolds have a binding site for the MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK, ensuring that the signal occurs rapidly. Clinical Significance Because MAPKKKs are involved in a wide range of cell responses occurring both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, a mutation in these genes can cause several diseases. Over-expression of the MAPKKK upstream of the ERK 1/2 MAPK and an increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can lead to tumor formation, such as triple negative breast cancer. A mutation in the JNK or p38 family of MAPK or their MAPKKK upstream precursors can result in Alzheimer's Disease. This is also seen when there is too much oxidative stress in the brain, causing these MAPKs to undergo more apoptosis and destroy brain cells. MLK, a type of MAPKKK, are associated with Parkinson's Disease and inhibitors to the MLK proteins have been shown to treat Parkinson's Disease. The MAPKKK pathways and specifically the over- expression of cascades of JNK and p38 are also involved in Crohn's Disease and polycystic kidney disease. Inhibitors of these pathways help in treating the symptoms of the diseases. Additional images File:MAPKpathway.jpg  MAPK pathway. Many of the MAP3K's here are labelled by their alternative names.

He umpired 3 Test matches between 1979 and 1980. His first match was between Australia and England at Sydney on 10 February to 14 February 1979, won by England by 9 wickets, thus retaining The Ashes. Australian captain Graham Yallop scored 121 of the first innings total of 198, but the rest of the batting in both innings failed against Ian Botham, John Emburey and Geoff Miller. Weser's partner was fellow debutant Tony Crafter. Weser's last Test match was between Australia and New Zealand at Perth on 12 December to 14 December 1980, won by Australia by 8 wickets, with a bowling attack of Dennis Lillee, Rodney Hogg, Len Pascoe, and Jim Higgs proving too powerful. Weser's colleague was again Tony Crafter. Weser also umpired 8 One Day International (ODI) matches between 1979 and 1981.  Underarm bowling incident of 1981  On 1 February 1981, during the third World Series Cup final at the MCG between Australia and New Zealand, Weser was informed by Greg Chappell that his brother Trevor would bowl the final ball underarm, thus denying New Zealand the chance to hit a six and tie the game. It was Weser's duty to inform both batsmen which he duly did. This incident, illegal in England but legal at the time in Australia, is one of the great controversies of world cricket. The match branded as the Underarm incident was notable for several umpiring controversies. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58.Wisden Cricketers Almanack ‚Äì 119th edition (1982) In his live commentary former Australian cricket captain Richie Benaud exclaimed \\"that is one of the best catches I have ever seen in my life\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6agc6mYEkE Following a short discussion, Snedden's catch was ruled not out by the two Australian umpires, Weser and Peter Cronin. It was some years before TV replays could be used in umpiring decisions. However the Channel Nine TV broadcast did show viewers a number of slow motion replays of Snedden's catch from various TV angles including a close up of Snedden diving to fairly claim the catch. After reviewing several TV replays Benaud re-affirmed what he had initially seen live, stating in his commentary: \\"there is no question in my mind that that was a great catch - clearly caught above the ground, a superb catch.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6agc6mYEkE Chappell went on to score 90 in his innings. In yet another umpiring controversy during the match, Australia had one too many fielders outside the field restriction line when the final ball was bowled meaning the delivery should have been adjudged a no- ball by the umpires.The Underarm Ball That Changed Cricket, Abhishek Raghunath, Forbes India, 11 February 2011 The match would be the last international men's cricket match Weser was to umpire.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8411.html The Underarm match would also be the last international match for umpire Cronin.

Along with his father, he built up a private observatory at Dun Echt, Aberdeenshire. He employed David Gill to equip the observatory, using the best available technology. Among his achievements, Gill later made the first photograph of the Great Comet of 1882,Gill, D. \\"On Photographs of the Great Comet\\", Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 43, p.53 pioneering astrophotography and the mapping of the heavens. Crawford mounted expeditions to Cadiz in 1870, to observe the eclipse of the sun; India in 1871, to observe the eclipse of the sun; and then to Mauritius in 1874, to observe the transit of Venus. On the latter two expeditions Crawford employed London photographer Henry Davis, who in 1876 was appointed Crawford's personal librarian. Upon hearing of a threat to close down the Edinburgh Royal Observatory,The Royal observatory, Edinburgh in 1888 Crawford made a donation of astronomical instruments and his books on mathematics and the physical sciences from the Bibliotheca Lindesiana in order that a new observatory could be founded.Lord Crawford's donation of books and instruments Thanks to this donation, the new Royal Observatory, Edinburgh was opened on Blackford Hill in 1896. As well as much astronomical equipment, Crawford's observatory included an extensive collection of rare books, part of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana at Haigh Hall, which his father and he had accumulated till it was one of the most impressive private collections in Britain at the time. The Bibliotheca Lindesiana A book plate from the Bibliotheca Lindesiana The Bibliotheca Lindesiana (i.e. Lindsayan or Lindsian library) had been planned by the 25th Earl and both he and his eldest son had been instrumental in building it up to such an extent that it was one of the most impressive private collections in Britain at the time, both for its size and for the rarity of some of the materials it contained. Alexander William Lindsay had been a book collector from his schooldays and so he continued. In 1861 he wrote to his son James (then 14 years old) a letter which describes his vision of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana; in 1864 he redrafted and enlarged it while visiting his villa in Tuscany. By now it was 250 pages long and under the name of the \\"Library Report\\" it continued to be added to during their lifetimes. He based his plan on the Manuel of J.-Ch.

Crawford's name was included as one of the \\"Fathers of Philately\\" in 1921. Politics Crawford was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Wigan in 1874, and held the seat until his elevation to the peerage in 1880. Personal life On 22 July 1869, the Earl, who was then Lord Lindsay, married Emily Florence Bootle- Wilbraham, the daughter of Col. Hon. Edward Bootle-Wilbraham (a son of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale) and Emily Ramsbottom (fourth daughter of James Ramsbottom). Together, James and Emily were the parents of seven children: * Lady Evelyn Margaret Lindsay (1870‚Äì1944), who married James Francis Mason, only son of James Mason of Eynsham Hall, in 1895. * David Alexander Edward Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford (1871‚Äì1940), who married Constance Lilian Pelly, second daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Pelly, 3rd Baronet, MP, and Lady Lilian Charteris (a daughter of Francis Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss), in 1900. * Hon. Walter Patrick Lindsay (1873‚Äì1936), who married Ruth Henderson, eldest daughter of Isaac Henderson, of Rome, Italy in 1902. They divorced in 1927. * Major Hon. Robert Hamilton Lindsay (1874‚Äì1911), who served as aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India and married Mary Janet Clarke, a daughter of Hon. Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet and Janet Marian Snodgrass (daughter of Hon. Peter Snodgrass) in 1903. * Rev. Hon. Edward Reginald Lindsay (1876‚Äì1951), a barrister and, later, Curate of St Matthew's, Bethnal Green who died unmarried. * Rt. Hon. Sir Ronald Charles Lindsay (1877‚Äì1945), a diplomat who married Martha Cameron, daughter of American Senator J. Donald Cameron. * Hon. Lionel Lindsay (1879‚Äì1965), who married his cousin, Kathleen Yone Kennedy, a daughter of Sir John Gordon Kennedy and Evelyn Adela Bootle-Wilbraham (older sister of Emily, Countess of Crawford). Lord Crawford died on 31 January 1913. His widow, Emily, the dowager Countess of Crawford, died on 15 January 1934. =Descendants= Through his eldest son, the 27th Earl, he was a grandfather of eight, two sons and six daughters, including David Lindsay, 28th Earl of Crawford, Hon. James Lindsay (Member of Parliament for Devon North), Lady Mary Lilian Lindsay (wife of Lord Chancellor Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne, whose daughter was Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller), and Lady Katharine Constance Lindsay (wife of Sir Godfrey Nicholson, 1st Baronet, and mother of Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne). Through his son Robert, he was a grandfather of Australian politician Robert Lindsay. =Other positions and honours= Lindsay received the degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1882, and in the following year was nominated honorary associate of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences. He became a trustee of the British Museum and acted for a term as president of the British Library Association. He had a strong connection to Wigan, where he was chairman of the Free Library Authority and head of the Wigan Coal Company. In January 1900 he received the Freedom of the borough of Wigan. Crawford was a member of the Council of the Zoological Society of London from 1902.

The stadium, formerly owned by the City of Edinburg in years prior to 2014, was donated to the University of Texas System. The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley operates the stadium. It was renamed in 2016.

The traditional components of a tea set may vary between societies and cultures. History The accepted historyTea Set History , by Miriam Ellis, 2006 of the tea set begins in China during the Han Dynasty (206‚Äì220 BC). At this time, tea ware was made of porcelain and consisted of two styles: a northern white porcelain and a southern light blue porcelain. These ancient tea sets were not the creamer/sugar bowl companions that are now commonly used, but were rather bowls that would hold spiced or plain tea leaves, which would then have water poured over them. The bowls were multi-purpose, and used for a variety of cooking needs. In this period, tea was mainly used as a medicinal elixir, not as a daily drink for pleasure's sake. It is believed the teapot was developed during the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD). An archaeological dig turned up an ancient kiln that contained the remnants of a Yixing teapot. Yixing teapots, called Zi Sha Hu in China and Purple Sand teapots in the U.S., are perhaps the most famous teapots. They are named for a tiny city located in Jiangsu Province, where a specific compound of iron ore results in the unique coloration of these teapots. They were fired without a glaze and were used to steep specific types of oolong teas. Because of the porous nature of the clay, the teapot would gradually be tempered by using it for brewing one kind of tea. This seasoning was part of the reason to use Yixing teapots. In addition, artisans created fanciful pots incorporating animal shapes. The Song Dynasty also produced exquisite ceramic teapots and tea bowls in glowing glazes of brown, black and blue. A bamboo whisk was employed to beat the tea into a frothy confection highly prized by the Chinese. Chinese Yixing tea set This is a Chinese Yixing tea set used to serve guest which contains the following items. * A Yixing teapot * A tray to trap the wasted tea/water. * Cups to drink the tea. * A Tea tool kit which contains the following: digger, funnel, needle, shuffle, tongs and vase. * A brush to wipe the wasted tea all over the tray to create an even tea stain. * A sieve‚Äîeven if you pour tea from the pot, some tea leaf bits will still be poured out, so a sieve will help to filter out the loose bits during pouring. * A clay animal or two.

It coexisted with the Indian rupee from 1950. Like the Indian rupee, it was divided into 16 annas, each of 12 pai. Coins were issued in copper (later bronze) for denominations of 1 and 2 pai and ¬Ω anna, in cupro-nickel (later bronze) for 1 anna and in silver for 2, 4 and 8 annas and 1 rupee. Hyderabad was the only Indian princely state that was permitted to continue issuing its own notes after it was subjected to join the Dominion of India in 1948 and the Republic of India in 1950. History The Government of Hyderabad made several efforts to organize private bankers to set up a banking company which could issue paper money. The British, however, resisted the attempts of Indian princely states to issue paper currency. The acute shortage of silver during the First World War and the contributions of Hyderabad to the British war effort led them to accept, in 1918, paper currency in denominations of Rs.10/- and Rs.100/- issued under the Hyderabad Currency Act. The currency was designated the Osmania Sicca (OS). One and five rupee notes were subsequently issued in 1919 and one thousand rupee notes were issued in 1926. After the setting up of the India Currency Notes Press at Nashik, Hyderabad notes came to be printed there. In 1942, the Government of Hyderabad established the Hyderabad State Bank, with the responsibility, inter alia, of managing the OS. Hyderabad continued to mint its own coins until 1948, when India occupied the state after the Nizam refused to cede it to the new republic. In 1950, the Indian rupee was introduced alongside the local currency, with the relationship of 7 Hyderabad rupees = 6 Indian rupees being used. In 1951, the Hyderabad rupee ceased to be issued and the Indian rupee became the main circulating currency, although the Hyderabad rupee was not demonetized until 1959. Banknotes Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, 1329 AH (1911 CE). Hyderabad - One Rupee Coin issued by Mir Osman Ali Khan - 1335 AH Silver(The Urdu letter \\"Ain\\" inside the Charminar represents 1st letter of the word \\"Osman\\" The banknotes of Hyderabad were issued from 1918 until 1953. The ruling Nizam of Hyderabad was Mir Osman Ali Khan. Notes issued as early as 1916 have been reported. The notes are dated in the Fasli Era, so adding 589 to the FE date will convert it to the AD date. They were printed in Urdu, with the value of currency written in Urdu, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada and English on them. In 1932, a quantity of unissued, but water stained Hyderabadi notes in 5, 10, and 100 rupee denominations were recovered from the SS Egypt, which sank off the island of Ushant near Brest, northern France in 1922. Many of these were given a special stamping and sold as souvenirs. These notes were in the process of being shipped from England where they had been printed. These notes are of historic interest to notaphilists. Some of the notes are printed slightly later than the dates that they bear. The double letter serial number prefix determines what series the note is located in. Some of the 1939-53 issues have a single serial number prefix series code letter.

Its format has also changed over the years, with a lengthy sports highlights segment - found in few other CBC newscasts - replaced by additional features and panel discussions in 2001.

During the season of Hockey Night in Canada, the newscast aired nationwide at 6:00 p.m. ET / 3:00 p.m. PT on CBC Television. Otherwise it aired at 6:00 p.m. local time (7:00 AT, 7:30 NT). Additional airings were at 5:00, 9:00 and 12:00 midnight ET on Newsworld, with the 9:00 edition being frequently updated from the early-evening broadcast. The Saturday edition of The National currently follows a similar broadcast schedule. Until the late 1990s, the main network also aired a late edition of Saturday Report outside of hockey season; this was later reduced to a short update and ultimately eliminated. A similar update continued to air during the first intermission of HNIC late games. Prior to being renamed Saturday Report in 1982, the program was called The Saturday Evening News, and was anchored by Jan Tennant and alternately George McLean.

The article has photographs of repair work done to the tower in 1988 - one shows a corner of an \\"octagon\\" inner tower core, not bonded to the outside, while another suggests a bonded, and rounded, core. There are narrow openings in the tower with monolithic heads in worn pale stone, the openings filled with old-looking wooden boards pierced with vertical rows of round holes.

The school was established in 1957. It houses Bel Air Middle School, with transfers from Eastwood as well as other local middle schools. Its Health Professions Branch offers the most transfers, closely followed by the Global Enterprises program. Bel Air High School placed 984th on Newsweeks list of the nation's top high schools based on rankings influenced heavily by the number of students who took Advanced Placement tests the previous year. In 2013 Texas UIL changed the areas from 4A-5A to a 5A-6A divisions causing Bel Air High School to remain behind in the 5A division due to the lack of student population. Engineering During freshman year, all students take Concepts of Engineering and Technology. In sophomore year, they are separated into three smaller divisions, entering into Engineering Design and Presentation, Principles of Engineering (PTLW), or Principles of Architectures and Construction. In junior year, they gain the second level of their previous choice, which are Robotics and Automation, Digital Electronics, and Architectural Design. In senior year, they develop into two pathways, Engineering Design and Development, and Advanced Interior Design. Band The Bel Air High School \\"BIG RED PRIDE\\" Marching Band has been a staple of the fine arts department and has had success spanning nearly four decades. In 1999, the band became Grand Champions at the New Mexico Tournament of Bands, the first in school history. The band has attended all 5 incarnations of the Coronado T-Bird Marching Invitational, which started in 2015, placing 4th, 2nd in 2016, and 1st since 2017. The band currently holds the record for the most titles at three. The band is also a consistent Bands of America (BOA) finalist. Since 2007, the band has placed within the final 10 participants at the BOA Regionals in Long Beach, St. George, Midland, Los Angeles, and El Paso. In 2015, the Bel Air Band began a wave of success, receiving Division I ratings, and placing within the top 10 of all major competitions. Due to the 4A-5A to 5A-6A shift, the UIL Area Marching Band Contest was split into zones, leaving all bands in that zone competing for spots to advance to state. At the 2015 UIL Area A West Contest, the band placed first and advanced to the UIL State Marching Band Contest for the first time since 2006, placing 18th overall. They later reclaimed the title in 2017, becoming back-to-back winners, and placing 19th overall.

The field has been home to a number of minor league teams. The AAA American Association Springfield Redbirds played there from 1978 to 1981. Two affiliates in the Class-A Midwest League also called Lanphier home; the Springfield Cardinals and the Springfield Sultans, as well as an independent Frontier League team, the Springfield Capitals. Earlier teams who played intermittently at the stadium in its youth included the Class-B Springfield Senators and Springfield Browns, both of the Three-I League. In December 2007 it was announced that baseball would return to Springfield, Illinois. The Springfield Sliders debuted in the CICL (Central Illinois Collegiate League) and won the league championship in their first season. It would be the final CICL championship, as the league was disbanded and its teams (including the Sliders) are now a part of the Prospect League.

The 20th-century witch Sybil Leek claimed to be a descendant of Leigh's, and took to keeping a jackdaw, named Mr. Hotfoot Jackson, around with her, just as Leigh had done. Early life Leigh was born in 1685 in a cottage on the edge of the moors at Burslem (now one of the towns of Stoke-on-Trent) in Staffordshire. She was a solitary character who made a living selling milk from her herd of cows to travellers and passers-by. She was an eccentric person who kept a pet blackbird. The bird often sat on her shoulder when she brought milk into Burslem to sell to the dairy. She was known for her quick temper, and the people of Burslem were suspicious of her. This was not surprising as, throughout the country, women, particularly elderly women, who lived on their own in remote places were often labelled as witches. Witchcraft In Leigh‚Äôs case it was the local parson, Rev. Spencer, who made the accusation. He claimed that Leigh sent her blackbird to sit on the sign of the Turk‚Äôs Head pub that the parson frequently visited, and that the bird's presence was responsible for turning the beer sour. Leigh was also blamed for other ailments suffered by the townsfolk. Death Leigh died in 1746 and was buried in Burslem churchyard, but there were claims that her ghost haunted the town. Spencer‚Äîalong with clerics from Stoke, Wolstanton, and Newcastle-under-Lyme‚Äîexhumed her body, opened the coffin, and threw in the still-living blackbird that had been her companion. They then reburied Molly in a north to south direction, at a right angle to all the other graves in the churchyard. Mythology There are stories that her ghost appeared to walk the streets of Burslem apologising for her sins. Further stories claim that her spirit was exorcised by a group of several priests and that while it was successful, some of them died in the process. Some claim that if one skips around her grave three times chanting the mantra \\"Molly Leigh, Molly Leigh, Chase me around the apple tree,\\" her spirit will return. These ghost stories are still told to young children to this day. Pop Culture The story of Molly Leigh has been used as the inspiration for a feature film, Molly Crows, by Flashgun Films. Filmed in the Stoke area in 2012 and distributed through Disrify via Facebook in 2014.distrify.com/films/8749-molly-crows-award- winning-film The film plot involves the spirit of Molly returning to wreak revenge upon the descendants of those who wronged her. The story of Molly Leigh is featured in the finale of the Alton Towers Dungeon. The scene features the telling of the story to guest in a dark atmospheric room before inanimate objects begin to move and the guests encounter Molly herself.

Work in this area spans several academic fields, including philosophy, computer science, economics, and statistics. The focus of formal epistemology has tended to differ somewhat from that of traditional epistemology, with topics like uncertainty, induction, and belief revision garnering more attention than the analysis of knowledge, skepticism, and issues with justification. History Though formally oriented epistemologists have been laboring since the emergence of formal logic and probability theory (if not earlier), only recently have they been organized under a common disciplinary title. This gain in popularity may be attributed to the organization of yearly Formal Epistemology Workshops by Branden Fitelson and Sahotra Sarkar, starting in 2004, and the PHILOG-conferences starting in 2002 (The Network for Philosophical Logic and Its Applications) organized by Vincent F. Hendricks. Carnegie Mellon University's Philosophy Department hosts an annual summer school in logic and formal epistemology. In 2010, the department founded the Center for Formal Epistemology. Topics Some of the topics that come under the heading of formal epistemology include: * Ampliative inference (including inductive logic); * Belief revision theory * Game theory and decision theory; * Algorithmic learning theory (computational epistemology); * Formal approaches to paradoxes of belief and/or action; * Formal models of epistemic states, like belief and uncertainty; * Formal theories of coherentism and confirmation; * Foundations of probability and statistics.

It was the spring training home of the San Diego Padres from 1970 through 1993, the North American League's Yuma Scorpions minor league baseball team, the Arizona Winter League, and the Arizona Summer League. The stadium serves as the main field of the Ray Kroc Baseball Complex. The stadium was built for the 1970 spring training season using a 2% hospitality tax and $100,000 in bonds. The Padres started training in Yuma in 1969 but trained at Keegan Field, on 24th Street, while the new ballpark was being built. The first game was March 6, 1970, with Arizona Governor Jack Williams throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. The stadium was expanded again in 1984. In 2015, Desert Sun Stadium was converted to a soccer stadium by OneGoal LLC, an organization that paid for the $15,000 conversion fee. Frontera United had played at Desert Sun Stadium from 2015 to 2017. WWE Wrestling occasionally makes a stop at the complex.

Holton and his group at Florida State University in 1994 was the first total synthesis of Taxol (generic name: paclitaxel). The Holton Taxol total synthesis is a good example of a linear synthesis starting from commercially available natural compound patchoulene oxide. This epoxide can be obtained in two steps from the terpene patchoulol and also from borneol. The reaction sequence is also enantioselective, synthesizing (+)-Taxol from (‚àí)-patchoulene oxide or (‚àí)-Taxol from (‚àí)-borneol with a reported specific rotation of +- 47¬∞ (c=0.19 / MeOH). The Holton sequence to Taxol is relatively short compared to that of the other groups (46 linear steps from patchoulene oxide). One of the reasons is that patchoulene oxide already contains 15 of the 20 carbon atoms required for the Taxol ABCD ring framework. Other raw materials required for this synthesis include 4-pentenal, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, methyl magnesium bromide and phosgene. Two key chemical transformations in this sequence are a Chan rearrangement and a sulfonyloxaziridine enolate oxidation.  Retrosynthesis  It was envisaged that Taxol (51) could be accessed through tail addition of the Ojima lactam 48 to alcohol 47. Of the four rings of Taxol, the D ring was formed last, the result of a simple intramolecular SN2 reaction of hydroxytosylate 38, which could be synthesized from hydroxyketone 27. Formation of the six-membered C ring took place through a Dieckmann condensation of lactone 23, which could be obtained through a Chan rearrangement of carbonate ester 15. Substrate 15 could be derived from ketone 6, which, after several oxidations and rearrangements, could be furnished from commercially available patchoulene oxide 1. Retrosynthetic analysis for the Holton Taxol total synthesis.  AB Ring synthesis  As shown in Scheme 1, the first steps in the synthesis created the bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane AB ring system of Taxol. Reaction of epoxide 1 with tert-butyllithium removed the acidic Œ±-epoxide proton, leading to an elimination reaction and simultaneous ring-opening of the epoxide to give allylic alcohol 2. The allylic alcohol was epoxidized to epoxyalcohol 3 using tert-butyl hydroperoxide and titanium(IV)tetraisopropoxide. In the subsequent reaction, the Lewis acid boron trifluoride catalyzed the ring opening of the epoxide followed by skeletal rearrangement and an elimination reaction to give unsaturated diol 4. The newly created hydroxyl group was protected as the triethylsilyl ether (5). A tandem epoxidation with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid and Lewis acid-catalyzed Grob fragmentation gave ketone 6, which was then protected as the tert- butyldimethylsilyl ether 7 in 94% yield over three steps. Scheme 1.  C Ring preparation  As shown in Scheme 2, the next phase involved addition of the carbon atoms required for the formation of the C ring. Ketone 7 was treated with magnesium bromide diisopropylamide and underwent an aldol reaction with 4-pentanal (8) to give Œ≤-hydroxyketone 9. The hydroxyl group was protected as the asymmetric carbonate ester (10). Oxidation of the enolate of ketone 10 with (-)-camphorsulfonyl oxaziridine (11) gave Œ±-hydroxyketone 12. Reduction of the ketone group with 20 equivalents of sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminumhydride (Red-Al) gave triol 13, which was immediately converted to carbonate 14 by treatment with phosgene. Swern oxidation of alcohol 14 gave ketone 15. The next step set the final carbon- carbon bond between the B and C rings. This was achieved through a Chan rearrangement of 15 using lithium tetramethylpiperidide to give Œ±-hydroxylactone 16 in 90% yield. The hydroxyl group was reductively removed using samarium(II) iodide to give an enol, and chromatography of this enol on silica gel gave the separable diastereomers cis 17c (77%) and trans 17t (15%), which could be recycled to 17c through treatment with potassium tert-butoxide. Treatment of pure 17c with lithium tetramethylpiperidide and (¬±)-camphorsulfonyl oxaziridine gave separable Œ±-hydroxyketones 18c (88%) and 18t (8%) in addition to some recovered starting material (3%). Reduction of pure ketone 18c using Red-Al followed by basic work-up resulted in epimerization to give the required trans-fused diol 19 in 88% yield. Scheme 2.  C Ring synthesis  As shown in Scheme 3, diol 19 was protected with phosgene as a carbonate ester (20). The terminal alkene group of 20 was next converted to a methyl ester using ozonolysis followed by oxidation with potassium permanganate and esterification with diazomethane. Ring expansion to give the cyclohexane C ring 24 was achieved using a Dieckman condensation of lactone 23 with lithium diisopropylamide as a base at -78 ¬∞C. Decarboxylation of 24 required protection of the hydroxyl group as the 2-methoxy-2-propyl (MOP) ether (25). With the protecting group in place, decarboxylation was effected with potassium thiophenolate in dimethylformamide to give protected hydroxy ketone 26. In the next two steps the MOP protecting group was removed under acidic conditions, and alcohol 27 was reprotected as the more robust benzyloxymethyl ether 28. The ketone was converted to the trimethylsilyl enol ether 29, which was subsequently oxidized in a Rubottom oxidation using m-chloroperbezoic acid to give the trimethylsilyl protected acyloin 30. At this stage the final missing carbon atom in the Taxol ring framework was introduced in a Grignard reaction of ketone 30 using a 10-fold excess of methylmagnesium bromide to give tertiary alcohol 31. Treatment of this tertiary alcohol with the Burgess reagent (32) gave exocyclic alkene 33. Scheme 3.  D Ring synthesis and AB ring elaboration  In this section of the Holton Taxol synthesis (Scheme 4), the oxetane D ring was completed and ring B was functionalized with the correct substituents. Allylic alcohol 34, obtained from deprotection of silyl enol ether 33 with hydrofluoric acid, was oxidized with osmium tetroxide in pyridine to give triol 35. After protection of the primary hydroxyl group, the secondary hydroxyl group in 36 was converted to a good leaving group using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride. Subsequent deprotection of the trimethylsilyl ether 37 gave tosylate 38, which underwent cyclization to give oxetane 39 by nucleophilic displacement of the tosylate that occurred with inversion of configuration. The remaining unprotected tertiary alcohol was acylated, and the triethylsilyl group was removed to give allylic alcohol 41. The carbonate ester was cleaved by reaction with phenyllithium in tetrahydrofuran at -78 ¬∞C to give alcohol 42. The unprotected secondary alcohol was oxidized to ketone 43 using tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO). This ketone was deprotonated with potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature and further oxidized by reaction with benzeneseleninic anhydride to give Œ±-hydroxyketone 44. Further treatment of 44 with potassium tert- butoxide furnished Œ±-hydroxyketone 45 through a Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein Rearrangement. Substrate 45 was subsequently acylated to give Œ±-acetoxyketone 46. Scheme 4.  Tail addition  In the final stages of the synthesis (Scheme 5), the hydroxyl group in 46 was deprotected to give alcohol 47. Reaction of the lithium alkoxide of 47 with the Ojima lactam 48 adds the tail in 49. Deprotection of the triethylsilyl ether with hydrofluoric acid and removal of the BOM group under reductive conditions gave (‚àí)-Taxol 51 in 46 steps. Scheme 5.  Precursor synthesis  Patchoulene oxide (1) could be accessed from terpene patchoulol (52) through a series of acid-catalyzed carbocation rearrangements proceeded by an elimination following Zaitzev's rule to give pathoulene (53). The driving force for the rearrangement is relief of ring strain. Epoxidation of 53 with peracetic acid gave patchoulene oxide 1. 600x600px  Protecting Groups  = BOM (benzyloxymethyl) = Protection Reagents: Benzyloxymethyl chloride, N,N-diisopropylethanamine, tetrabutylammonium iodide, in refluxing dichloromethane, 32 h.

A member of the Republican Party, he served in the Nebraska Legislature, as mayor of the capital city of Lincoln, and as the 28th governor of the state. Anderson, the son of Swedish immigrants, Ernest F. and Marie Larson Anderson, was born in Havelock, Nebraska (which was subsequently incorporated into Lincoln). He attended the University of Nebraska after his graduation from Havelock High School in 1920. However, he left the university two and one-half years later to become a partner in his father's plumbing and hardware business. He was married on December 27, 1941 to Elizabeth (Betty) May and the couple had one son, Roger Lee. Political career Anderson assumed his first political position in 1936, when he was appointed a trustee of Lancaster County Sanitary District. No. 1. He was then elected to that position three times. In 1948, he was elected to a seat in the Nebraska legislature, and took office in 1949. He resigned in 1950 when the Lincoln City Council unanimously chose him to fill the vacated post of mayor. Running for reelection in 1951, he won by a large majority. While he was in office, Lincoln Air Force Base was re-activated, the city charter was amended, the \\"O\\" street viaduct was replaced, and, for the first time in fifteen years, street resurfacing was done. Anderson sought the Republican nomination to run for governor in 1952, but lost in the primary. In 1954, he again ran for the governorship, this time winning. He was reelected by a large majority in 1956. During his tenure, taxes and expenditures were reduced, mental health programs were improved, and a prison riot was successfully calmed. He sought a third term in 1958, but lost to Democratic candidate Ralph G. Brooks, in what was then the closest election in Nebraska history. In 1959, U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower chose Anderson as a U.S. delegate to the NATO-sponsored Atlantic Congress in London, England. He was a delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention. Business In 1949, Anderson bought the controlling interest in the Havelock National Bank and was named president. He held that position until his death. In 1949, he also began the Victor E. Anderson Bottled Gas and Propane Company. Death and legacy Anderson died of a heart attack in Lincoln, Nebraska on August 15, 1962. He is interred at Wyuka Cemetery, Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska USA. He belonged to the Freemasons, the Elks, the Moose, the Odd fellows, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and was a member of the Methodist church. A library in the Lincoln City Libraries public library system is named after Anderson.

Millicer, AM (11 June 1915 ‚Äì 28 August 1996) born Henryk Kazimierz Milicer, was a Polish-Australian aircraft designer and pilot. Early life and Second World War Millicer was born in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Kazimierz Milicer, a university professor whose family was descended from Baron Karl von Militzer. An ardent Polish patriot, Henry developed an early interest in aviation. In 1924 he won an aeromodelling competition with the prize being a flight over Warsaw, his home city. At age 14 he built a full-size glider and at 17 qualified as a glider pilot. After receiving a degree in aeronautical engineering he worked as a junior designer in the National Aviation Works (Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Lotnicze) on the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ bomber project headed by Jerzy DƒÖbrowski and later for the RWD company on the RWD-25 low-wing, fixed-wheels fighter project. He was also a member of the Polish Air Force reserve and flew against the Germans at the outbreak of the Second World War, winning the Polish Air Force Cross. At the defeat of Poland in September 1939, he was given the responsibility of ferrying the presidential papers in a small plane to Romania, then escaped to France and England where he flew in a Polish bomber squadron in the Royal Air Force. He completed seventeen missions before being seriously wounded in a training exercise. He was awarded the Polish Military Medal for his service and became an interpreter between Polish, French and British pilots. In 1941 he married Warsaw-born Krystyna Paciorkowska, the daughter of the Polish politician Jerzy Paciorkowski. Aeronautical engineer and academic In 1943 he obtained a scholarship to study for a master's degree in aeronautical engineering at Imperial College, London, joining Airspeed Ltd. in 1945 and later the Percival Aircraft Company. The Percival Provost design is attributed to Millicer. In 1950 he migrated to Australia and became chief aerodynamicist at the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF), working on the Jindivik and the Malkara missile. With two colleagues, Gordon Bennett (head of structures) and James Tutty, he entered a design competition sponsored by the Royal Aero Club of London for a replacement aircraft for the de Havilland Chipmunk. The Millicer team beat 103 contestants and won the competition with a design that ultimately became the Victa Airtourer. After several years of production Victa Aviation sold the rights to a New Zealand company. Millicer also had developed a slightly larger 4 place aircraft known as the Aircruiser, with one prototype built at the Bankstown, New South Wales, Victa factory and first flown in 1966. A military trainer version of this was under development at the time of the closure of the Victa operation which was subsequently converted in NZ into the PAC CT/4 military trainer. His other inventions include a patent for the vortex flap and a suction grass mower (honored in the Sydney 2000 Olympics opening). He also published Aerodynamics for Soaring Pilots for the Gliding Club of Victoria. Millicer became the principal lecturer in Aeronautics at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) with a view to establishing this faculty as the leading school in Australia. He retired in 1980 but remained associated with his faculty at RMIT and in 1984 his work was recognised with the award of an Honorary Doctorate in aeronautical engineering. In 1992 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia. He continued to be involved in the design of aircraft and formed Millicer Aircraft Industries which bought the rights to the Aircruiser that Millicer had designed for Victa. He continued to act as an advisor for aeronautical graduate projects on a part-time basis. Millicer died at the age of 81. His ashes were scattered from the air over the coast near his home at Anglesea, off the Great Ocean Road. He is survived by a son, Richard Maciej, and two daughters, the author Joanna Millicer Hempel, and Helen Millicer, and eight grandchildren.

The trade name Red-Al refers to its being a reducing aluminium compound. It is used predominantly as a reducing agent in organic synthesis. The compound features a tetrahedral aluminium center attached to two hydride and two alkoxide groups, the latter derived from 2-methoxyethanol. Commercial solutions are colorless/pale yellow and viscous. At low temperatures (<-60¬∞C), the solution solidifies to a glassy pulverizable substance with no sharp melting point. SMEAH is a versatile hydride reducing agent. It readily converts epoxides, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, acyl halides, and anhydrides to the corresponding alcohols. Nitrogen derivates such as amides, nitriles, imines, and most other organonitrogen compounds are reduced to the corresponding amines. Nitroarenes can be converted to azoxyarenes, azoarenes, or hydroazoarenes, depending on the reaction conditions. Some common functional group reductions using SMEAH can be found below: 500px Comparison with lithium aluminium hydride As a reagent, SMEAH is comparable with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH, LiAlH4). It is a safer alternative to LAH and related hydrides. SMEAH exhibits similar reducing effects, but does not have the inconvenient pyrophoric nature, short shelf-life, or limited solubility of LAH. Upon contact with air and moisture, SMEAH reacts exothermically but does not ignite, and tolerates temperatures up to 200 ¬∞C. Under dry conditions it has unlimited shelf life. It is soluble in aromatic solvents, whereas LAH is only soluble in ethers. For example, a solution greater than 70 wt.% concentration in toluene is commercially available. The reagent can be modified to effect partial reductions. SMEAH in toluene under reflux has been used to reduce aliphatic p-toluenesulfonamides (TsNR2) to the corresponding free amines and is one of the few reagents that can carry out this challenging reduction in general settings. Notably, LiAlH4 does not reduce this functional group unless forcing conditions are used.

Although it is believed that the original function of coats of arms was to enable knights to identify each other on the battlefield, they soon acquired wider, more decorative uses. They are still widely used today by countries, public and private institutions and by individuals. The earliest writer on the law of arms was Bartolus de Saxoferrato. The officials who administer these matters are called pursuivants, heralds, or kings of arms (in increasing order of seniority). The law of arms is part of the law in countries which regulate heraldry, although not part of common law in England and in countries whose laws derive from English law. Right to bear arms Illustration from a manuscript grant of arms by Philip II of Spain to Alonso de Mesa and Hernando de Mesa, signed 25 November 1566. Digitally restored. According to the usual description of the law of arms, coats of arms, armorial badges, flags and standards and other similar emblems of honour may only be borne by virtue of ancestral right, or of a grant made to the user under due authority. Ancestral right means descent in the male line from an ancestor who lawfully bore arms. Due authority has, since late medieval times, been the Crown or the State. In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, the Crown's prerogative of granting arms is delegated to one of several authorities depending on the country. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the authority to grant arms is delegated to the Kings of Arms of the College of Arms, under the direction of the Earl Marshal. In Scotland, this authority is delegated to Lord Lyon King of Arms at his or her own discretion. In Canada, it is exercised by Canadian Heraldic Authority under the direction of the Governor-General of Canada. In Ireland, unlike the position in the United Kingdom, a grant of arms from an official authority is not a legal prerequisite to the use of arms. For example, heraldic symbols and coats of arms that existed pre-1552 and afterwards belonged to the Gaelic tradition may continue in use, as well as arms without any official basis. In Spain, whilst the power to grant new arms is restricted to the king, the Cronistas de Armas (Chroniclers of Arms) have the power to certify arms within the province(s) of their appointment. As of 2008, there is currently only one, with authority only in the provinces of Castile and Le√≥n. Law of arms as part of the general law While the degree to which the general law recognises arms differs, in both England and Scotland a grant of arms confers certain rights upon the grantee and his (or her) heirs, even if they may not be easily protected. No person may lawfully have the same coat of arms as another person in the same heraldic jurisdiction although in England the bearing of identical arms without differencing marks by descendants from a common armigerous ancestor has been widespread and tolerated by the College of Arms. Although the common law courts do not regard coats of arms as either property or as being defensible by action, armorial bearings are a form of property nevertheless, generally described as tesserae gentilitatis or insignia of gentility. Armorial bearings are incorporeal and impartible hereditaments, inalienable, and descendable according to the law of arms. Generally speaking (there have been very rare examples of patents in which the arms are granted to descend with some different limitation), this means they are inherited by the issue (male and female) in the male line of the grantee, though they can be inherited as quarterings by the sons of an heraldic heiress, where there is no surviving male heir, provided her issue also have a right to bear arms in their own male line. =Ireland= In Ireland the granting of arms to Irish citizens or to those who can prove Irish ancestry is considered to be a cultural tradition which is allowed through the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. This Office was established under the English Crown in 1552 as the Ulster King of Arms and was converted to the Chief Herald's Office after the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. The Office of Chief Herald was given statutory force in the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.See http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0011/sec0013.html#sec13 However some doubts remained as to the effectiveness of the 1997 Act and proposals for further legislative amendment have been made by individual public representatives. For example, on 8 May 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy & Heraldry Bill, 2006,http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf in Seanad √âireann (Irish Senate) to this end. =England and Wales= In England and Wales, the law of arms is regarded as a part of the laws of England, and the common law courts will take judicial notice of it as such. These dignities, as they are called, have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and honours, such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be regarded as similar to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law. In England the exclusive jurisdiction of deciding rights to arms, and claims of descent, is vested in the Court of Chivalry. As the substance of the common law is found in the judgments of the common law Courts, so the substance of the Law of Arms can only be found in the customs and usages of the Court of Chivalry. However, the records of this are sparse, not least because the Court never gave reasoned judgments (the Lord Chief Justice who sat in 1954 offering the sole exception to this, no doubt because of his professional background as a common law Judge). The procedure was based on that of the civil law, but the substantive law was recognised to be English, and peculiar to the Court of Chivalry. Until 1945 coats of arms (engravings, public paintings, etc.) were taxed, with no distinction made in the statute between arms granted by the College of Arms or those which were self-assumed. =Scotland= The law of arms as understood in Scotland consists of two principal parts, the rules of heraldry (such as blazoning), and the law of heraldry. In contrast to the position in England, the Law of Arms is a branch of the civil law. A coat of arms is incorporeal heritable property, governed, subject to certain specialities, by the general law applicable to such property. The possession of armorial bearings is therefore unquestionably a question of property. The misappropriation of arms is a real injury, actionable under the common law of Scotland. =Canada= The Canadian law of arms is now regulated by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. =Denmark= In Denmark the unlawful use of coats of arms and other insignia of Danish and foreign authorities is a criminal offence (Danish Criminal Code ¬ß¬ß 132-133). Non-official coats of arms are not protected. A specific rendition of a coat of arms is protected through copyright law and a coat of arms can be used as a trademark and will thus be protected by trademark law. There is no official heraldic authority for private arms in Denmark. Most insignia used by municipalities are regulated by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State (an office under the Danish National Archives). Registration by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State is a prerequisite for protection of official Danish insignia under the Criminal Code's ¬ß¬ß 132-133. Protection of an insignia in terms of trademark law requires registration by the trademark authorities. If an insignia is registered by the Heraldic Consultant, trademark rights are automatically acquired as well. During the Absolutist era, arms of nobility were granted by the King's herald, but this office was dissolved in 1849 when the absolutist era ended. Since then, the only way to acquire coats of arms in Denmark is through assumption. The Danish state has never claimed any exclusive right to grant arms and families and individuals has always had the freedom to assume arms. =Norway= The national arms and the royal arms arms sort under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and military arms are a matter of the heads of each branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces.Hans Cappelen:The Heraldry of the Norwegian Armed Forces,Genealogica & Heraldica Lisboa 1986, Lisboa 1989, Vol. 2, p. 179-185 The National Archives of Norway are the heraldic authority for the royal approbation of municipal arms.Hans Cappelen: R√®gles pour utilisation des armoiries communales en Norv√®ge\\", Archivum Heraldicum (1-2) 1976. Public arms are protected by the Norwegian Penal Code, article 328.Straffeloven, ¬ß 328 at Lovdata. The same article prohibits as well unauthorised use of foreign public arms and some distinctive signs of international organizations.Hans Cappelen:The Concept of the Coat of Arms in Norwegian Legislation\\", Kongressbericht, Stuttgart 1978. There exists no official authority for private arms and the question of legal protection of private arms has not been asked to a Norwegian legal court.Hans Cappelen:\\"On taking the family arms of others\\", Genealogica et Heraldica ‚Äì Wien 14.19. September 1970 (Congress Report) Vienna 1972 . Personal arms, family arms and other private arms have been self assumed in Norway since the Middle Ages, without any grants, interference or protests from the public authorities.Hans Cappelen: Norske Slektsv√•pen, Oslo 1969 pages 25-39. =Germany= In Germany the arms relate to a family, and so a name, and not to an individual. The right to the arms passes from the original bearer to those of his legitimate direct descendants by a male line. Since 1918 heraldic affairs are handled under the Civil Law. The right to arms is now considered analogous to the right to names, expressed in the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch ¬ß 12; this interpretation was confirmed in 1992 by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany. Thus, if one has the right to certain arms, that right is protected by the courts. Personal arms are protected as a part of the name if the arms are officially recorded and published. =Italy= Speaking very generally, Italian coats of arms may be said to be familial rather than personal. A formal system for indicating cadency is unknown outside the House of Savoy. In Italy there has been no official regulation of familial coats of arms or titles of nobility since abolition of the Consulta Araldica in 1948, and that body addressed itself primarily to state recognition of titles of nobility rather than the heraldry of untitled armigers such as nobili (untitled nobles) and patrizi (of the patriciates in the former city-states). Until the unification of the country in the decade leading to 1870, the issuance and use of familial coats of arms was exercised rather loosely in the various Italian states, with each region applying its own laws, and the principal focus was titles of nobility or (before circa 1800) feudal rights. Indeed, upon ennoblement, a count or baron not from an armigerous family might actually assume his own, original coat of arms without recourse to any authority. For this reason, actual grants of arms were very rare. There is no complete armory of Italian coats of arms, though certain authors, most importantly Giambattista Crollalanza, compiled references which appear to be nearly complete. Until the establishment of the republic (1946) and its constitution two years later, most coats of arms in Italy appertained to noble families, whether titled or not, although a number of blazons were identified with cittadini (burghers) whose families had used these for a century or more. The Blasonario contemplated by the Consulta Araldica would have been an official compilation of blazons (i.e. an armory), but it was still in a very early draft stage when the monarchy was abolished in 1946. In 1967 the Constitutional Court ruled that nobiliary and heraldic matters were \\"outside the scope of the law\\". Italy's concordat with the Vatican in 1984, revising the Lateran Treaties, abrogated the article whereby Italy recognises Papal titles. =South Africa= Under South African law, which is Roman‚ÄìDutch, all citizens have the right to assume and bear arms as they please, provided they do not infringe the rights of others (e.g. by bearing the same arms). The Bureau of Heraldry has the power to register coats of arms to protect against misuse, but registration of arms is voluntary. =United States= In the United States protection of coats of arms is for the most part limited to specific units of the armed forces, with a few exceptions. George Washington, in personal correspondence, expressed opposition to establishment of a national heraldic authority, though he made use of his own ancestral arms. Personal coats of arms may be freely assumed but the right to these blazons is not protected in any way. It is possible that a coat of arms could be successfully protected as a trademark or service mark, but, in general, such protection is reserved for commercial use as a mark connected with a good or service, and not as a heraldic coat of arms. For example, the University of Texas at Austin has registeredUS Trademark Serial No. 73321841 its emblem and coat of arms for use in its capacity as an institution of higher education. Moreover, such protection presumes a specific graphic design or work of art, while blazon is a description which may be widely interpreted artistically. A specific coat of arms could be protected by copyright as a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work. The usual requirements of originality and artistic creativity would need to be met; neither notice nor registration is required but may be advisable. Enforcement of the law of arms =England: Court of Chivalry= In England the officer with power to adjudicate on legal aspects of the law of arms is the Earl Marshal, whose court is known as the Court of Chivalry. The court was established some time prior to the late fourteenth century with jurisdiction over certain military matters, which came to include misuse of arms. Its jurisdiction and powers were successively reduced by the common law courts to the point where, after 1737, the Court ceased to be convened and was in time regarded as obsolete and no longer in existence. That understanding was authoritatively overturned, however, by a revival of the Court in 1954, when the Earl Marshal appointed the then Lord Chief Justice to sit as his surrogate. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard confirmed that the Court retained both its existence and its powers, and ruled in favour of the suit before him. However, in his judgement (Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties [1955] P 133) Lord Goddard suggested that :if this court is to sit again it should be convened only where there is some really substantial reason for the exercise of its jurisdiction. In 1970, Arundel Herald Extraordinary advised Wolfson College, Oxford (who were considering whether to invoke a controversial University privilege in order to avoid paying for a grant of arms) that the effect of Lord Goddard‚Äôs dictum ‚Äúmust make any further sitting of the court unlikely even for a cause of instance; and the revival of causes of office, which were obsolescent even in the seventeenth century, would be more difficult still.‚Äù (quoted in ‚ÄúThe Coat of Arms of Wolfson College Oxford‚Äù by Dr Jeremy Black The College Record 1989‚Äì90). In 1984, Garter King of Arms declined to ask the Court to rule against the assumption of unauthorised arms by a local authority, doubting whether the precedents would give jurisdiction (A New Dictionary of Heraldry (1987) Stephen Friar p 63). Hence, although the Law of Arms undoubtedly remains part of the law of England, and although the Court of Chivalry in theory exists as a forum in which it may be enforced, there is difficulty in enforcing the law in practice (a point made in Re Croxon, Croxon v Ferrers [1904] Ch 252, Kekewich J). The absence of a practical remedy for the illegal usurpation of arms in the law of England does not mean that there are no rights infringed, merely that it is not within the jurisdiction of the common law courts to act and that the court that is so empowered does not now sit. =Scotland: Court of the Lord Lyon= In Scotland, Lord Lyon King of Arms is the judge of the Lyon Court, which has jurisdiction over all heraldic matters. An act of the Scottish parliament in 1592 made the unauthorised use of arms a criminal offence and gave Lyon the responsibility to prosecute such misuse, though in practice this might not be legal today. Unlike the Court of Chivalry, the Court of the Lord Lyon is very much alive, and is fully integrated into the Scottish legal system. Arms conferring nobility In England a grant of arms does not ennoble a grantee in itself, but is a recognition of rank or status and, therefore, an authoritative confirmation of it. An armiger (one who has the right to bear arms) is deemed to be of the status of a gentleman, and in England, many of the suits in the Court of Chivalry were decided on that basis. He may of course be of higher rank, as esquire, knight, peer, or prince. In contrast, a coat of arms in Scotland is often, not without controversy, said to be a fief annoblissant, similar to a Scottish territorial peerage or barony. Under Sir Thomas Innes of Learney (Lord Lyon King of Arms 1945‚Äì1969), wording was introduced into every Scottish patent of arms which states that the grantee \\"and his successors in the same are, amongst all Nobles and in all Places of Honour to be taken, numbered, accounted and received as Nobles in the Noblesse of Scotland\\". These claims, strongly championed by Innes of Learney himself and by other writers, have now found broad acceptance amongst legal commentators as correctly representing the Law of Arms in Scotland (for example, The Stair Encyclopaedia of Scots Law (vol. 11, p. 548, para. 1613)), but are challenged by others, some of whom are reluctant to place a grant of arms on the same legal plane as a feudal barony or peerage. In 2008, the so-called nobility clause seen in Scottish grants of arms since the days of Lord Lyon Innes of Learney was dropped and is no longer included in new grants of arms. On the European continent, there is a clear difference between noble arms and burgher arms. In most countries, scholars agree that a coat of arms is an indication of nobility, but that (in times past) simply assuming a coat of arms did not ennoble the armiger. In certain countries (viz. the Italian states pre-1860), armorial heraldry was not strictly regulated, while titles of nobility were. As a generality, most nobles, whether titled or not, have coats of arms, hence the widely held perception of heraldry as an aristocratic trapping. Assumption of arms While in the continent of Europe assumption of arms has mostly remained free, in some countries arms may not be assumed or changed at will. In particular, there is some basis for the claim that it is unlawful to assume arms in England and Wales without the authority of the Crown. This is the view of the College of Arms and is supported by some dicta in court cases, including In re Berens, [1926] Ch. 596, 605‚Äì06, and Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties Ltd, [1955] P. 133 (the only modern decision of the Court of Chivalry). However, there is no holding by a modern court directly on point. For cases considering the question but not deciding it, see Austen v. Collins, 54 L.T.R. 903 (Ch. 1886); In re Croxon, [1904] Ch. 252. However, the assumption of arms has in every age been common, and became particularly so after the College of Arms ceased to obtain warrants to search out the illegal use of armory by roving enquiries known as the Visitations, the last of which took place at the end of the seventeenth century. The interpretation and application of modern legal principles (such as freedom of expression) have also influenced this, and the annual tax on coats of arms was repealed in 1945. Burke's General Armory (last edition 1884) is said to contain arms attributed to 60,000 families (The Upper Classes; Property and Privilege in Britain J. Scott (1982) p 91). But it has been calculated that there were only 9,458 armigerous families in 1798 (The Nobility of the English Gentry J. Lawrence (1824)) and a total of 8,320 grants of arms made in the 19th century (English Nobility: the Gentry, the Heralds and the Continental Context M J Sayer (1979)), which implies, albeit on an extremely rough and ready basis, about 40,000 assumptions of arms.

Baseball in particular was challenged to find available dates at Oak Bay Grounds to operate due to a preference for lacrosse.British Colonist April 14, 1907 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca Subsequently, the supporters of Canada's national summer sport lacrosse, at a meeting chaired by BC Premier McBride formed the Royal Victoria Athletic Association on March 26, 1908,British Colonist March 27, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca and a senior lacrosse team was founded to enable the best intermediate (Under 21) players to play in the British Columbia Amateur Lacrosse Association (BCALA) League. The Oak Bay Grounds were put under the management of the senior baseball teamBritish Colonist April 9, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca and then later the Rugby Football Club.British Colonist Oct 24, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca The lacrosse group, later shortened to the Royal Athletic Association, issued shares at $25 each with deposits of 10% and biannual calls of 10% to raise $25,000 for improvements to the grounds. The lease was signed for 5 acres at the corner of Cook and Pembroke Streets for the grounds.British Colonist March 28, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca Contracts had been let by May 12, 1908 and $4,000 from the share offering and gate receipts was spent by June on the construction of a perimeter fence, 2 ticket offices, an inner fence, grandstand, and carriage parking area. The inner fence enclosed the 500 ft x 285 ft (152m x 87m) playing field. The grandstand on the south side of the playing field was 150 ft long x 25 ft deep with 10 rows of seats for more than 1000 spectators. Beneath the grandstand were dressing rooms and concessions.British Colonist May 12, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca The original layout of the field and grandstand was essentially the same as today's; however based on maps used in advertisingBritish Colonist June 6, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca the original field also included half of the city block to the west between Quadra and Vancouver Streets. The carriage parking was on the east side off Cook Street. The Victoria West Athletic Association, James Bay Athletic Association, and Central Lacrosse Club as well as others with intermediate lacrosse teams also played at the Royal Athletic Association grounds. Field lacrosse was to be the primary sport at the grounds. The facility was a multi-sport community asset from the beginning as cricket, football (Canadian, Rugby, and Association codes), field sports, boxing, other sports, the circus, fireworks, theatre, and other events were allowed to rent the facility. Due to field shortages, the Victoria and District Football Association (soccer) started renting RAP in September 1908 as the Royal Athletic Association‚Äôs main winter tenant for district and inter- community league games.British Colonist September 11, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.caBritish Colonist October 24, 1908 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca The first soccer game played was at 3pm September 12, 1908 between Victoria West and Fifth Regiment, Victoria West won 10-0.British Colonist September 13, 1908 p17 of 40 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca The first recorded baseball game was an exhibition on June 27, 1908 between the Chicago Ladies‚Äô Baseball Club and Rendell‚Äôs Team on June 27, 1908.British Colonist June 23, 1908 p9 of 18 Available:http://www.britishcolonist.ca In the mid-1920s RAP became home to amateur baseball with the construction of the Crystal Gardens on the main Victoria baseball grounds. The first mention of Royal Athletic Park in the British Colonist (which later merged with the Victoria Times to become the Victoria Times Colonist) is on May 21, 1908. It is an advertisement for an inter-provincial championship lacrosse game against a Vancouver side on May 25, 1908 at the new Royal Athletic Park.British Colonist May 21, 1908 available at: http://britishcolonist.ca/ Many advertisements right from the start emphasize its location less than 1-1/2 mile from downtown, still a major feature of the facility's popularity among spectators. The land was purchased by the city in 1925 from the Royal Athletic Association and the park underwent a major restoration in 1967 after a large fire in 1964 burned the original grandstands. The park has been the home to many different sports teams, notably including the Victoria Rebels (CJFL 1985-2008), Victoria Athletics (Western International League 1946-1954) and Victoria United (Pacific Coast Soccer League 1995-2012). From 1 July to 11 July 2007, Royal Athletic Park was one of six host venues for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. The stadium hosted Group F, and also featured Japan vs Czech Republic in a Round of Sixteen game. =Notable Games= * 1926 Victoria Reps 1 ‚Äì 5 English F.A. touring team * 1927 Victoria Reps 1- 4 Scottish F.A. touring team * 1929 Victoria 0 ‚Äì 1 Welsh Selects * 1930 Victoria West 1 ‚Äì 8 Glasgow Rangers ( really a select side in Vic West colors) * 1931 Victoria Reps 0 ‚Äì 7 English 1st Div.

The annual Highland games for example have been a steady user of the facility. The park also plays host to the Great Canadian Beer Festival annually each summer. During the winter and spring Vancouver Island Soccer League games including Jackson Cup playoffs are hosted by RAP. RAP has accommodated everything from amateur as well as professional soccer, junior football, softball to professional baseball games, international competitions, festivals and concerts, among others. The amateur baseball Victoria HarbourCats of the West Coast League signed a 3-year contract as the anchor tenant starting in 2013. The Harbourcats season runs from June to August. Numerous baseball teams have used RAP since the Victoria Athletics, baseball has been a periodic user of the facility since the Athletics. The Athletics were a New York Yankees b-team in the late 1940s. The last baseball team, the Victoria Seals of the Golden Baseball league, folded after only two seasons, and did not return for the 2011 baseball season. The park lost their main Canadian football tenant, the Victoria Rebels, in 2008 to the new Bear Mountain Stadium at City Centre Park located in nearby Langford, BC. Field lacrosse is typically played at the Juan de Fuca Recreation Centre and Centennial Stadium. Due to baseball lease arrangements, in 2012 the Victoria United Football Club moved their home grounds to Braefoot Park for 2012. Infrastructure improvements including a more stable moveable outfield fence for baseball are planned to facilitate multiple user groups. RAP was also home to defunct soccer teams, Victoria Riptide and Victoria Vistas of the CSL. Layout and design The park is a large rectangular plot oriented east-west, and the seating has been designed to accommodate field sports such as football (Canadian, Aussie, Rugby, Association codes), field lacrosse, baseball, and other field sports. The main baseball diamond (there is a secondary one in the NE corner) is located in the southwest corner. The permanent park seating is set up on the south and west sides of the property in a L-shape. At south sideline midfield, there is the main covered grandstand, about the width of three bleachers, and quite a bit deeper than the bleachers. East of the main grandstand there is a \\"full length\\" bleacher and a \\"half length\\" bleacher. Between the small \\"baseball\\" grandstand at the southwest field corner and the main grandstand there are 4 bleachers. Along the west end of the field extending northward from the smaller \\"baseball\\" grandstand √¨s a \\"full length\\" bleacher and a \\"half length\\" bleacher. The facility is set up to be accessible to as many different sporting entities as possible with the L-shaped seating. The design allows for numerous seating capacities with the addition of temporary seating. The stadium is surrounded by high-intensity lights on all sides allowing night games. There is surface parking just west of the stadium shared with the hockey arena, Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. Residential and commercial development including single family detached houses and multi-family developments are on all sides of the city block. The stadium was recently upgraded with a new $400,000 video scoreboard intended to replace the decades- old minimalist baseball scoreboard. The scoreboard is situated on the northwest side of the park, or just beyond left field using the main baseball diamond configuration. Aside from a large full-colour video screen, the scoreboard also features prominently the name 'Royal Athletic Park' in large, arcing letters overhead. Capacity The park has a permanent seating capacity of 5,700 including temporary bleachers. There are 3,800 permanent seats in the covered mid-field grandstand. Depending on its configuration and the event, it can hold a larger capacity, often listed as a max capacity of 9,247. Temporary bleachers were added to expand seating for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup games. (In the above picture, one can see some examples of added temporary seating behind the shorter bleachers on the right half of the picture). An announced total of 14,500 was later altered to 10,500, as temporary grandstands were not erected behind the goal on the east side.Permanent Seating of the Royal Athletic Park, City of Victoria See also * List of stadiums in Canada * List of soccer stadiums in Canada  References  External links * City of Victoria - Royal Athletic Park * Satellite view of Royal Athletic Park on Google Maps * Western Canada Turfgrass Association - Sportsfield Managers - Article Category:1994 Commonwealth Games venues Category:Sports venues in Victoria, British Columbia Category:Canadian football venues in British Columbia Category:Soccer venues in British Columbia Category:Baseball venues in British Columbia Category:Minor league baseball venues ","title":"Royal Athletic Park"},{"id":"3660182","title":"List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet"},{"id":"3660191","text":"Clarence Edgar \\"Mick\\" Harvey (17 March 1921 ‚Äì 6 October 2016) was a first- class cricketer and Australian Test cricket umpire. He was the brother of Test batsmen Merv and Neil Harvey. He was born at Newcastle, New South Wales and died at Brisbane, Queensland. Harvey made his first-class debut in 1948-49, playing in the first three matches of the season for Victoria as an opening batsman. However, he was unproductive, scoring only 91 runs at a batting average of 15.16, and was dropped. He moved to Queensland the following season in search of more opportunities and was selected in one match. Harvey had his best first-class season in 1950-51, scoring 490 runs at 37.69, including his maiden first-class century against a full-strength New South Wales team with several Test bowlers. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, and did not play a single first-class match in 1952-53\\\\. Recalled the following season, he overcame a slow start to score two centuries later in the summer to end with 421 runs at 38.27 for the summer. After a poor season, Harvey was dropped late in the 1955-56 season. Harvey was dropped after two matches in 1956-57, ending his first-class career. After his playing career was over, Harvey took up umpiring, and made his first-class debut in 1974-75\\\\. He became a regular official over the next few seasons and then broke into international umpiring in 1978-79\\\\. In that summer, Harvey stood in two One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Test. The following season he made his final appearances at international level, presiding over another Test and four ODIs. His last season of top-level domestic umpiring was in 1981-82 during which he officiated in two matches. He finished his career having presided over 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.  Early years  Mick's father Horace \\"Horry\\" Harvey moved to Broken Hill, New South Wales where he worked for BHP driving horse-drawn trailers.Coleman, p. 552. In 1914, he married Elsie May Bitmead and their first two children, daughter Rita and son Merv, were born in the mining town. The family relocated to Newcastle, a mining town and harbour in New South Wales, where Clarence Edgar Harvey--always known as Mick, as he was born on Saint Patrick's Day--and Harold were born. In 1926, the Harveys shifted to the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, a staunchly working-class, industrial area. During their relocation, Ray was born in Sydney. Horace secured a job at the confectionery company Life Savers (Australasia) Ltd, located next door to their house at 198 Argyle Street. The 19th century two- storey house was owned by the firm and was used as lodgings for the workers‚Äô families. It no longer exists, having been demolished to make way for a textile factory. The two youngest sons Neil and Brian were born in Fitzroy. The Cornish-descended Horry raised his family as strict Methodists, disallowing gambling, alcohol, tobacco and profanity in his household. An ardent cricketer, he encouraged his children to play sport. He himself played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy. As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, the boys took to playing cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house.Coleman, p. 553. Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket. They were usually joined by other local children, two of whom became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven (an Australian rules footballer) and Harold Shillinglaw (both an Australian rules footballer and first-class cricketer)--the group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers has been attributed to these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing.Coleman, p. 551. As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball that sharpened their reflexes,Coleman, p. 553. and a miniature bat.Harvey, p. 26. All were right-handed batsmen with the exception of Neil.Harvey, p. 25. All of the children attended the nearby George Street State School and, one by one, the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access to all of the club's facilities.Harvey, pp. 26-27. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal.Harvey, p. 27. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant.Coleman, pp. 555-556. The Harveys had no formal coaching,Coleman, p. 555. and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed.Coleman, p. 555. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique.Harvey, p. 29. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty, and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism. During the winter, they played baseball for Fitzroy, often competing in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day's cricket matches for Fitzroy, and Plant, Liddicut and other cricket club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular.Coleman, p. 556.  World War II and first- class debut  A printer by trade, Harvey first played in the Fitzroy First XI in 1938-39\\\\. Mick opened the batting with Merv, and in 1942-43, when Neil broke into the First XI, the family occupied the first four batting positions for the team; Merv and Mick opened and Ray and Neil came in after them.Harvey, pp. 30-31. During World War II, Harvey enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force at Fitzroy on 4 March 1943 and was a member of the 39th Infantry Battalion and went on to serve in Kokoda. He was discharged on 29 March 1946 with the rank of private. He resumed cricket with Fitzroy at the war's end and made enough runs to be selected for Victoria's first three Sheffield Shield matches of the 1948-49 season. Playing as an opening batsman, he made 10 and 13 on debut against Queensland, and was trapped leg before wicket (lbw) in both innings in an eight-wicket win. In the next match against New South Wales, who boasted Australia's new ball opening bowlers Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, Harvey made 19 and 33 in a drawn match. In the subsequent match against South Australia, he made 4 and 12, again being trapped lbw in both innings. The 1948-49 season was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Having scored only 91 runs at a batting average of 15.16, Harvey was dropped from the team. He did not play alongside Ray, who was dropped, and Merv, who had retired. It was Harvey's last season for Fitzroy, and in 90 first-grade matches, he scored 2,601 runs at an average of 30.24.Coleman, p. 564.  Move to Queensland  At the time, Queensland were the least successful team in the Sheffield Shield, and Harvey moved north to Brisbane the following season to try to get more opportunities to play Sheffield Shield cricket. Harvey joined the Toombul grade club, and made his first-class debut for Queensland against Victoria late in the season, although none of his brothers played for Victoria in this match; Merv had already retired, Neil was representing Australia, and Ray had been dropped. In his only match for the summer, he scored 1 and 13 and took two catches in each innings as an opener. He was dropped after the match. In 1950-51, his most prolific first-class season, he hit 490 runs at 37.69 for Queensland. The season started with consecutive matches against a full-strength New South Wales, who had an attack including Lindwall, Miller, Alan Walker and Alan Davidson. In the first match, in Brisbane, Harvey made 40 and 19 batting at No. 7 before being dismissed by Davidson and Lindwall respectively. The visitors won by an innings. In the return match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Harvey was promoted to bat at No. 3. He made 38 in the first innings before being dismissed by Walker. Harvey broke through for his maiden first-class century in the second innings, scoring an unbeaten 100. Queensland declared at 4/237 as soon as he reached his milestone, only to see the hosts reach the victory target of 225 with all ten wickets intact. Harvey played against an international outfit for the first time in the following match against the touring England cricket team, but made only three in his solitary innings. However, he continued to score consistently, making a half-century in each of the next three matches. From the third of these matches--against South Australia--onwards, he generally opened the batting for Queensland. On his first innings back as an opener, he narrowly missed a century, being dismissed for 95 by Geff Noblet. However, it was enough for the Queenslanders to take a 162-run first innings lead in a low-scoring match in which only one team surpassed 240 once, and set up an eight-wicket victory, the only time his state won a match for the season. Harvey's performance tapered away in the last two matches of the season. He made only 0 and 2 in the last match against Victoria, and 48 runs in his last four innings. Harvey started the 1951-52 season poorly, scoring 9 and 5 against a full-strength New South Wales team. In the following match, he made 90 in the first innings as Queensland defeated the touring West Indies by ten wickets. Harvey was sidelined for six weeks before returning in late December against Victoria. He struggled in this match and the next against New South Wales, scoring 9, 20, 9 and 3. In the next match, he made 46 in the first innings before managing only five in the second, against South Australia. Nor did Queensland have success in these three matches. They were one wicket away from victory in the first match when time ran out, and lost the other two. Harvey was dropped for the remainder of the season, ending with 196 runs at 21.77. Harvey was overlooked for Queensland selection for the whole 1952-53 season. He was recalled at the start of the 1953-54 campaign and made 26 and 20 in the first match against New South Wales, failing to convert his starts into big scores. He was retained despite making 15 and 0 in the next match against Victoria, but scored only 1 in the first innings of the match against South Australia starting on Christmas Day. Victoria were set 329 for victory, and having made only 62 runs in five innings for the season so far, he was the mainstay of the innings, scoring 102, but his team were all out for 245. The century saw Harvey retained in the side and started a productive second half of the season. He made 2 and 58 in the next match starting on New Year's Day, against New South Wales. Harvey then made 84 in the only innings of a drawn match against Victoria, before scoring 111 in an innings win against Western Australia. It was the first time in over two years that Harvey had played in a victorious Queensland side. He made only 2 in the final match of the season against South Australia to end with 421 runs at 38.27 for the summer.  Decline  Harvey continued his good form at the start of the 1954-55 season, scoring 90 and 9 in the opening match against New South Wales. He then made 49 and 9 against the touring England cricket team of Len Hutton. In the Christmas match against South Australia, Harvey failed to capitalise on his starts, making 31 and 35 as Queensland won by 34 runs. The following week, he made only 0 and 3 not out in the New Year's match against New South Wales. He finished the truncated season with only 16 in the following match against Victoria, ending the summer with 242 runs at 30.25. Harvey had a poor season in 1955-56\\\\. He scored only 37 runs in six completed innings in the first three matches. In the next match against Western Australia, he made only 8 in the first innings but scored 70 not out in the second innings as his team's run-chase petered away to a draw, and he retained his position in the team. He then made 17 and 28 in the next match against South Australia, run out in the latter innings after making a start. After making 10 and 20 in the next match against New South Wales, he was dropped for the remainder of the season, having made only 190 runs at 17.27 for the season. Recalled at the start of the 1956-57 season, Harvey made 40 and 28 in his first match of the summer against New South Wales, but after scoring only 2 and 2 not out against Western Australia in the next match, he was dropped for the final time. Noted for his sound defence, he was a patient and dogged batsman, in contrast to the exciting styles of brothers Merv, Ray and Neil. According to Neil, Mick had a weakness against spin bowling.Harvey, p. 31. Harvey was a rare bowler during his first-class career. He bowled only five overs in total, delivering one over in five different matches. He never took a wicket. Altogether, he made 1,716 first-class runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches at an average of 27.23. Harvey was also a regular choice for the Queensland baseball team during his career. His daughter Pauline Harvey-Short represented Australia at softball, before becoming a sports administrator. She is a fellow of the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, and was a founding member of Womensport Queensland in 1993, serving as the chair of the board from 2007 until 2010. Her daughter Kirby Short plays cricket for the Queensland women's team.  Umpiring career  After his retirement as a player, Harvey took up umpiring. His initial first-class match was in 1974-75, when he officiated in Queensland's home match against Victoria late in the season; at the time the host team provided both umpires. The following year, he was selected for four first-class matches, one of which was against the touring West Indies. He also officiated in his first List A match, presiding over the final of Australia's domestic limited-overs tournament, which Queensland hosted against Western Australia. The following two seasons were similar; Harvey stood in four first-class matches including one against a touring international team, and one List A match, both of which were quarter- finals. In 1978-79, Harvey's appointments increased. Harvey stood in all of Queensland's five home Shield matches, as well as their match against the touring Englishmen. He stood in one List A match involving Queensland and was then rewarded with his international debut in the second ODI between Australia and England at the SCG, before presiding over the next ODI at the MCG. At the end of the season, Harvey was selected for the first of his two Tests. The first, played by Australia against Pakistan at the MCG in March 1979 was dramatic. During the run-chase, the Australians were stunned by a spell of 7 wickets for 1 run by Sarfraz Nawaz, just when they looked like winning. Sarfraz ended with 9/86--the other wicket was run out--as Australia collapsed from 3/305 to 310 all out to lose by 71 runs. Harvey's partner was Robin Bailhache. Harvey's other Test match was between Australia and the West Indies at the MCG during the Christmas-New Year period of 1979-80\\\\. It was won by the visitors by 10 wickets, with a bowling attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft, and Joel Garner proving too powerful for their hosts. Harvey's colleague was Tony Crafter. Harvey also stood in four ODIs played during the inaugural World Series Cup that season, which involved England, Australia and the West Indies. He presided in three of the round-robin matches, the third of which was between the two visiting teams at the Gabba. It was the only time that Harvey umpired a match at his adopted home ground. He later presided over the first match of the finals series, between the West Indies and England at the MCG. This was his sixth and final appointment at ODI level. Harvey also officiated three Shield matches, Queensland's tour match against England and one of their domestic one-dayers during the season. The following season, Harvey presided over four of the five home Shield matches, a tour match by India, and a domestic one-dayer, but was overlooked for an international fixture. Harvey's final fixtures were during the 1981-82 season. He officiated in two matches hosted by Queensland in November, a Shield match and a one-dayer, both against Queensland. Altogether, he umpired 31 first- class and 13 List A matches in his career. He continued to umpire interstate matches at youth level until 1988 and stood in six finals the first grade of Queensland's local competition.

CarShield Field became the host of the entire six‚Äìteam 2020 CarShield Collegiate League upon the cancellation of the 2020 Prospect League season due to Covid-19. CarShield Field is home to a local high school baseball team, The Christian O'Fallon Eagles. It opened in 1999 with seating for 3,500 people, plus areas for 1,650 additional fans on lawn and outfield bleacher areas. History The ballpark hosted a number of special events in addition to Rascals home games. On October 13‚Äì14, 2007 the ballpark was the site of the longest baseball game in recorded history. A group of 40 players from the Men's Senior Baseball League of St. Louis played for 39 hours 29 minutes and 25 seconds. They played 92 innings and the score was 119‚Äì81 as the team representing the St. Louis Browns beat the team representing the St. Louis Stars. The record was reset in October 9‚Äì11, 2009 when the two teams played a 48-hour game, with the Browns defeating the Cardinals 180‚Äì140. Again, a new record was set when two teams played over 48¬Ω hours, headed towards 60 hours from July 3‚Äì5, 2012. On August 13, 2009, the stadium was the site of a home run derby between first baseman Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal for Shaq's reality television series, \\"Shaq Vs.\\" in front of a capacity crowd. CarShield Field has hosted the Missouri State High School Activities Association baseball championships since 2013 and will remain the home of the event through 2019. Also, the stadium hosted the 2015 Rams Coach Jeff FIsher Celebrity Softball Game in front of a crowd of over 3,000. For the 2020 baseball season, the Prospect League ceased play due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the O'Fallon Hoots played host to a six-team league at CarShield Field, with each team playing 30 game seasons and 7 inning games. The CarShield Collegiate League began play on July 1, 2020 with limited tickets.  References   External links  *River City Rascals *CarShield *T.R. Hughes Ballpark at 'Ballpark Reviews' *T.R.

Often used for forcible quarantine, many towns and cities had one or more pesthouses accompanied by a cemetery or a waste pond nearby for disposal of the dead. Fever sheds in Canada Fever sheds were built in several communities across Eastern Canada in 1847, to quarantine sick and dying Irish immigrants, who contracted typhus during the voyage to the New World during the Great Famine. =Montreal= In Montreal, between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as Windmill Point. Three sheds were initially constructed, long by 40 to wide. As thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected. The number of sheds would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick could not escape. =Toronto= In Toronto, during the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built by the Toronto Board of Health at the northwest corner of King and John Street. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. =Saint John= Partridge Island, New Brunswick, just outside the main harbour of Saint John, was chosen as the location for a pest house and quarantine station as far back as 1785. In 1847, with a large influx of Irish migrants, the typhus epidemic quickly filled the fever shed with sick and dying.

The English-speaking areas, south of the Landsker line and known as Little England beyond Wales, are notable for having been English linguistically and culturally for many centuries despite being far from the England‚ÄìWales border. History During the 11th and 12th centuries both invaders and defenders built more than fifty castles during a complex period of conflict, effectively to consolidate the line. The southernmost was Laugharne; others included Wiston, Camrose, Narberth, and Roch. These are often referred to as \\"frontier castles\\" but they were in fact set back a considerable distance from the frontier itself. In the heart of the Normanised colony, the two great fortresses were at Pembroke and Haverfordwest. There were other fortresses within the colony as well, including Manorbier, Carew and Tenby. The Landsker has changed position many times, first moving north into the foothills of Mynydd Preseli during the military campaigns of the Early Middle Ages, and then moving southwards again in more peaceful times, as the English colonists found that farming and feudalism were difficult to maintain on cold acid soils and exposed hillsides. Proportion of Welsh speakers (2011 census) When historians began to gain interest in the linguistic divide, they used the term \\"landsker\\", or \\"lansker\\", for example by Richard Fenton in 1810,Fenton, p.326 though the term had been used much earlier by antiquarian George Owen of Henllys in 1603.Fenton, p.524 It remains in common use. Local people may not be familiar with the term, but they recognise that the language divide stretching from St Bride's Bay to Carmarthen Bay remains very distinct. Language and genetic differences The differences in the proportion of Welsh speakers persists in the 21st century and is illustrated by the map derived from the 2011 census. Researchers at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics reported in 2015 \\"unexpectedly stark differences between inhabitants in the north and south of the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire\\" in DNA signatures. In-depth description The term Landsker is a word of Anglo-Saxon originAwbery, Gwenllian M, The Term 'Landsker' in Pembrokeshire in Journal of the Pembrokeshire Historical Society, 4, 1990-91, pp 32-41. used in southwest England and along the anglicised south Wales coast. It signifies a permanent, visible boundary between two tracts of land, and may be a natural feature (e.g. a river) or an artificial feature (e.g. a hedge or a line of marker stones). In Wales, its official use became obsolete at the end of the eighteenth century. In 1939, the term was first appliedDavies, M. F, Pembrokeshire, Part 32 (pp 75-170) of Stamp, L. D. (Ed.), The Land of Britain, Report of the Land Utilisation Survey, London, 1939. to the linguistic frontier in southwest Wales. This is an unfortunate usage, because the linguistic boundary, in general, is neither visible nor permanent. However, many commentators have taken up the use of the word in this context in the last 50 years, so that today it is usually understood to mean the language boundary. The language boundary is an example of a cultural frontier that has persisted, without legal status, for ten centuries or more. The boundary (with Welsh to the north and east, and English to the south and west) starts on St Bride‚Äôs Bay and follows a serpentine course eastwards until it meets the River Taf north of Laugharne in Carmarthenshire. Traces of a boundary also persist across the Llansteffan peninsula and the country near Kidwelly, and it reappears strongly in the boundary between English and Welsh Gower. The area to the south of the line was referred to in the 16th century as Anglia Transwalliana (Little England beyond Wales). In 1603, George OwenOwen, George, The Description of Pembrokeshire Dillwyn Miles (Ed) (Gomer Press, Llandysul 1994) . provided a snapshot description of the language boundary and 'Little England beyond Wales', and provided an antiquarian account of the settlement of English speakers in southwest Wales. This provides the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù view: that the area was cleared of native Welsh by the Norman invaders in the early 12th century, and was planted with Flemings from elsewhere in England. However, Owen pointed out that there was no trace of Flemish custom or language in his time. In fact, traditional Pembrokeshire English is lexically related to the Early English of southwest England, and in all probability the anglicisation of the south Wales coast paralleled the anglicisation of Devon and Cornwall, perhaps concurrently. A 2003 DNA studyC Capelli et al., ‚ÄúA Y Chromosome Census of the British Isles‚Äù, Current Biology,3, 979-984 (2003) showed that people in 'Little England' are genetically indistinguishable from the people of southern England. The frontier was not solely linguistic: there were also differences in customs (notably of inheritance) and in architecture. Owen characterised the cultural frontier in 1602 as both sharp and stable, and subsequent observers (with less local knowledge than Owen) have reiterated his description, and suggested that the line remained close to that described by Owen. The first objective, statistically based description of the frontier was made in the 1960s,John, Brian S, ‚ÄúThe Linguistic Significance of the Pembrokeshire Landsker‚Äù in The Pembrokeshire Historian, 4, 1972 pp 7-29. and showed a line similar to that described by Owen, although in some places it had moved north, while in others it had moved south. People in the frontier zone did not recognise the term ‚ÄúLandsker‚Äù, but were well aware of the location of the boundary. Rather than a sharp line of demarcation, the boundary consists of a corridor of mixed language, typically 3‚Äì5 km wide, in which the direction of language trend varies according to the migration characteristics of the inhabitants. The frontier zone has probably always had these characteristics. As mentioned above, the frontier moved between 1600 and today. Historic data on personal names also show that it also moved between 1200 and 1600. Attempts to set up a number of Norman/English ‚Äúplanned villages‚Äù (e.g. Letterston and New Moat) were made north of the current frontier in the medi√¶val period. These subsequently failed, and were re-occupied by Welsh speakers in the post Black Death period. In more modern times, the enclosure of commons allowed a substantial southward spread of Welsh speakers, particularly in Carmarthenshire. These are quite rare examples of Welsh-speaking areas expanding at the expense of English-speaking areas; in the central part of Pembrokeshire the shift of the Landsker southwards between 1600 and 1900 was in excess of 10 km. Southwest Wales is very rich in Norman Castles. Some are deep within the Welsh zone (e.g. Newport, Cardigan, Cilgerran, Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthen), and some are deep in Little England (e.g. Pembroke, Carew, Manorbier, Haverfordwest, Tenby). A number lie close to the language boundary (e.g. Roch, Wiston, Llawhaden, Narberth, Laugharne) and are sometimes referred to as ‚Äúfrontier castles‚Äù, but the whole of Dyfed (the territory south of the River Teifi and west of the Towy and Gwili) was in the hands of Norman marcher lords. The line is noted for being sharp, and for having moved only slightly over the past several centuries. A visible boundary which represents the Landsker line is Brandy Brook which runs through Newgale, remarked upon by Richard Fenton in his Historical Tour of 1810.Fenton, p.151 The first beach north after the brook has the Welsh name Pen-y-Cwm.

The name is directly related to Egyptian belief in constant North as a portal to heaven for pharaohs, and the stars' close association with eternity and the afterlife. These circumpolar stars are now known as Kochab (Beta Ursae Minoris), in the bowl of Ursa Minor or, the Little Dipper, and Mizar (Zeta Ursae Majoris), in Ursa Major, at the middle of the handle of the Big Dipper. Terminology Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson explained the naming as apt metaphor in Egyptian ideology. \\"Circumpolar stars are a very good metaphor for the afterlife because when viewed, they never seem to set: they simply rotate around the pole star. They are the undying stars, or in Egyptian terminology, the Indestructibles, a perfect destination for the soul of the dead king,\\" he said in 2001.Pyramids Seen as Stairways to Heaven, 14 May 2001 article by science writer Tim Radford for the Guardian The context for this is the Egyptian belief that Ra (the sun god) was given birth to by Nut (the sky goddess). Nut was pictured as a naked female spread across the sky, and identified with the Milky Way - the legs formed by the bifurcation at Deneb in Cygnus, and the head by the swelling at Gemini. The head of Nut passes below the horizon about 75 minutes after the sun on the spring equinox, and at the same point on the horizon, \\"consuming\\" Ra, who was symbolically reborn 272 days later on the morning of the Winter solstice, on the same declination as Deneb. Astronomy About 4,500 years ago, the Egyptians believed that the unmovable area the stars encircled by 10 degrees each, was heaven in the sense that it was the place of the afterlife. The pole star at the time was Thuban (Alpha Draconis). Cosmogony Egyptians associated those two stars with eternity and the afterlife of a king or pharaoh so that after death, a pharaoh would hope to join those stars. During the Old Kingdom it was thought that only the pharaoh and his family could ascend to heaven. As Pharaohs were buried in pyramids there were implications for their afterlife and their immortality and consequently the structures were deliberately aligned astronomically. Believing that their kings became stars in the Northern sky after death, Egyptians aligned their pyramids and temples due north toward the \\"indestructible\\" stars, giving the departed pharaohs direct access to the northern sky. Pyramid design thumbupright=2Schematic cross-section of the Great Pyramid: As the Egyptians believed that the unmovable area the stars circled was heaven, the pyramids were built to align north with a single, perfectly aligned vent. In King Khufu's Pyramid, the shaft itself, built into the structure, started at the chamber of King Khufu and ends at the outside. The shaft was built at an angle, so it could always sight The Indestructibles. The Egyptians built this vent in the pyramids in order to ensure a perfectly aligned path towards heaven (although recent researches have shown them not to be completely perfect).\\"The message of the Sphinx, A Quest for the Hidden Legacy of Mankind\\", Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, Three Rivers Press, 1997. Hancock and Bauval claim these inaccuracies mean that the Great Pyramid and by extension the Sphinx were built c. 10,500 BC, a suggestion not widely accepted. The entrances to all the Fourth Dynasty pyramids at Giza (the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure) are in their north faces and the corridors are sloped down from the entrances in such a way that both the circumpolar stars and the pole star were visible. The positioning of the pyramids is such that they do not block each other's views of these stars. A pyramid was a resting place, rather than a tomb, providing the occupant with all the requirements both physical and mystical for the journey of the ka to the afterlife to become an akh. Because of this, as David Warburton puts it, \\"In this sense... the entrance is in fact the exit\\". The North Shaft of the Kings chamber is also believed to have aligned with Beta Ursae Minoris to facilitate the King's journey as Horus to the stars.Secret doors inside the Great Pyramid Dr. Kate Spence of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Cambridge University argues that the alignment of the Great Pyramid of Giza was performed by waiting for a \\"simultaneous transit\\" of the circumpolar Indestructibles, and therefore, that by charting the precession of the stars a relatively accurate start date (+/- 5 years) for its construction can be given, namely 2480 BC. Previous Egyptian chronology for the Old Kingdom could only be considered accurate to within 100 years either way. Djoser's ka statue in its serdab The ka statue of Djoser in his tomb at Saqqara was in a serdab (a type of chamber) in the north-eastern base of his pyramid, tilted at 17 degrees to enable it to observe the circumpolar stars through two holes.

A forward, he made 340 appearances in the Football League, including 215 for Blackpool, for whom he is the only player to have scored in all of the top four divisions of English football for the same club. In his 20-year-long playing career, Ormerod played for Accrington Stanley, Southampton, Leeds United, Wigan Athletic, Preston North End, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Rochdale, Wrexham, Padiham and Bamber Bridge. Early life Ormerod went to school at Norden High School where he met Lisa Standring, who later became his wife. He has a brother named Darren and his mum Kathy. Ormerod worked at Hall and Letts textile factory in Great Harwood where he claimed to have earned ¬£130 a week. Club career =Accrington Stanley= Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Ormerod was released by hometown club, Blackburn Rovers, and signed for Accrington Stanley in 1995 playing semi-professionally. He made 54 league appearances, scoring 32 goals. While at Accrington he worked in a cotton mill to supplement playing part-time in non- league football. He was spotted playing by Gordon Strachan who vowed that his first task in getting back into management would be to buy Ormerod. =Blackpool= Ormerod signed for Blackpool, who were then in Division Two, on 21 March 1997 for ¬£50,000, making his debut as an 82nd-minute substitute on 29 March in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Chesterfield at Saltergate. His first league goal came the following season in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Carlisle United on 26 December 1997 at Brunton Park. He became a regular first-team player in the 1998‚Äì99 season, when he made 40 league appearances and scored eight goals. He spent four years with Blackpool, however he suffered a badly broken leg, breaking his tibia and fibula, in October 1999 that kept him out of the team in the 1999‚Äì2000 season when the club were relegated to the Third Division, something Ormerod would later describe as, \\"probably the lowest point of my career\\". He made his return the following season, and after signing a contract extension in January 2001, he helped the club to promotion through the play-offs. He scored the club's fourth goal in their 4‚Äì2 win over Leyton Orient in the Play- Off final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff on 26 May 2001. Ormerod made a blistering start to the 2001‚Äì02 season, and he was linked with a move to Wigan Athletic in November 2001, who were reported to have bid ¬£1.5m for him. They were one of four clubs to have made an approach for Ormerod, with Premier League club Southampton having had a ¬£1m bid rejected. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston said on the club's official website: \\"We don't have to sell Brett and we don't need to sell him. It's testament to the club's achievements and how the team are playing that other clubs are looking at players at this club.\\" However, despite this, Ormerod was signed by Southampton for ¬£1.75m on 7 December 2001. He had made a total of 150 appearances for The Seasiders scoring 62 goals in all competitions. 21 games 13 goals had come in the 2001‚Äì02 campaign. =Southampton= Gordon Strachan, then Southampton manager had kept his word about signing Ormerod, who made his debut for The Saints on 15 December 2001 as an 84th-minute substitute in a 2‚Äì0 home victory over Sunderland. After a number of substitute appearances, he finally made his full debut on 2 March 2002, when he also scored his first goal for the club, in a 3‚Äì1 win over Ipswich Town at Portman Road. He did not score again though until the following season, when he scored five goals in two games. On 2 October, he grabbed a hat-trick as The Saints beat Tranmere Rovers 6‚Äì1 in the second round of the 2002‚Äì03 Football League Cup. He followed that up three days later by scoring both goals as Southampton beat Manchester City 2‚Äì0 at St Mary's Stadium. On 13 April 2003, after enduring a 24-game goalless drought Ormerod scored one goal and laid up another as Southampton beat Watford 2‚Äì1 in the semi-final of the 2002‚Äì03 FA Cup at Villa Park. Ormerod then appeared in the FA Cup Final on 17 May at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, which Southampton lost 1‚Äì0 to a Robert Pires goal in the 37th minute. Ormerod found first-team opportunities limited at Southampton and on 19 September 2004, in an attempt to secure some first-team football, he joined Leeds United on a one-month loan deal. Ormerord missed a penalty on his Leeds debut, making six appearances. On 18 March 2005 he joined Wigan Athletic on loan for one month with a view to a permanent move. The move was intended to last until the end of the season and he made six appearances, scoring two goals in their 2‚Äì0 win against Leicester City at the Walkers Stadium on 16 April, before being recalled by Southampton manager Harry Redknapp on 26 April following an injury to Peter Crouch. After Southampton finished bottom of the Premer League in 2004‚Äì05 and were relegated to the Championship, he was able to play more often after the sale of several teammates who had been keeping him out of the team. Ormerod said of his time with the club, \\"I had some of the best years of my career at Southampton. It's a big club with great supporters. If I had my time again I would do exactly the same again, particularly as I got to play in a cup final.\\" =Preston North End= On 27 January 2006, Ormerod was snapped up on a free transfer by Preston North End, the arch-rivals of his former club Blackpool. After signing a three-and-a-half year contract, he said of the move, \\"It's a new start for me. Preston are a good team and I'm just really happy to be here.\\" Four days later he scored just thirteen minutes into his debut as they beat Crystal Palace 2‚Äì0 at Deepdale. On 8 May, he broke his leg, ten minutes into Preston's 0‚Äì2 playoff semi-final second leg defeat to Leeds United, following a tackle by Leeds' Jonathan Douglas. He made his return the following season as a 70th- minute substitute in a 4‚Äì1 home win over Sunderland on 14 October, and scored his first goal of the season in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 27 October. He fractured his cheekbone fifteen minutes into the 0‚Äì1 home defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 10 February 2007. After making twenty league and cup appearances, scoring one goal in the 2007‚Äì08 season, Ormerod signed on loan for Nottingham Forest on 7 March 2008, until the end of the season. He scored two goals for Forest in thirteen appearances against Walsall and Northampton Town, with his decent form helping Forest gain promotion to the Championship. On 15 October 2008 he joined League One club Oldham Athletic on a one-month loan deal, after falling out of favour at Preston and without making one appearance in the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made two starts and three substitute appearances for The Latics, but was forced to return to Preston earlier than scheduled after sustaining a broken toe in training in early November. His last game for Preston came in March 2008, he scored a total of thirteen goals in 62 league appearances. =Return to Blackpool= On 30 January 2009, after being released by Preston by mutual consent, Ormerod rejoined his first professional club, Blackpool, on a permanent deal until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his debut for Blackpool the following day as a 90th-minute substitute in The Seasiders' single-goal victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. On 7 March 2009 he scored the first goal in Blackpool's 2‚Äì0 victory over Norwich City at Bloomfield Road. It was his 100th league goal and his first goal since returning to the club. On 25 April, Ormerod's goal in a 1‚Äì1 home draw with Nottingham Forest that secured The Seasiders another season in the Championship. On 24 June Ormerod signed a new one-year contract, with an option for a further year, with Blackpool manager Ian Holloway saying, \\"I am delighted that Brett has signed again. He was a key player in the side that did well for the club towards the end of last season. He wants to be here, and is everything Blackpool stands for.'\\" Ormerod scored what proved to be the winning goal in the 45th minute of the 2010 Football League Championship play-off Final against Cardiff City on 22 May.Live ‚Äì Championship play-off final 22 May 2010, BBC Sport On 14 August, he became the first player to have played for the club in all four divisions, in Blackpool's Premier League debut, a 4‚Äì0 win over Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium. On 22 February 2011, he became the first Blackpool player to score for the club in all four divisions, after scoring their third goal against Tottenham Hotspur at Bloomfield Road. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season his contract with The Seasiders expired,. On 3 January 2012, Ormerod joined League One outfit Rochdale on loan for 28 days, joining Blackpool teammate Daniel Bogdanoviƒá. =Wrexham= On 2 July 2012, he signed a two-year deal with Wrexham of the Football Conference. Ormerod made his Wrexham debut on the opening day of the 2012‚Äì13 season, playing 75 minutes of the 3‚Äì1 victory over Woking. Ormerod scored his first goal for the club in the FA Cup against Southport. His first league goal in the fifth division came in an away 5‚Äì1 win over Braintree Town in November 2012. His next goal came in a boxing day home match against AFC Telford United, a game which he scored a double.

Memorial Stadium has been used for softball, soccer, and other non-sporting events. The stadium holds over 3000 people. The main grandstand is covered and constructed of concrete and brick. The seating in the grandstand consists of 12 rows of bench seats with the lower 6 rows having backrests. Additional seating includes metal bleachers along the first and third base lines and a party deck extending from just beyond third base to the left field corner. Until 2006 the playing surface consisted of natural grass and dirt. In 2006, Field Turf was installed. Stadium history The stadium was constructed in 1954 with funding from the Blue Star Mothers of America. It was originally used as a field for the patients of the VA Hospital to play softball. In 1993, the Frontier League began operations with the Chillicothe Paints playing in VA Memorial Stadium as one of the original 8 teams. The Paints organization with cooperation from the Department of Veterans Affairs renovated the stadium for the Paints opening game in June 1993.

He is celebrated as a great interpreter of Bach and has recorded his complete keyboard works. For decades Martins has been engaged as the leading pianist at the Boston Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and other ensembles. The New York Times wrote, \\"Maestro Martins has lived a life of renown, challenge, tenacity and triumph sufficient to fill a lively memoir\\". After his career as a concert pianist was derailed by injuries and accidents, he successfully reinvented himself as a conductor, leading hundreds of performances worldwide including acclaimed concerts at Carnegie Hall. He is a conductor at the English Chamber Orchestra and the Bachiana Filarmonica Orchestra. He has also founded social programs for underprivileged youth in Latin America. Early life A child prodigy, Martins began studying the piano with Jos√© Kliass at the age of eight. The following year, he won a competition sponsored by the Bach Society of Brazil. Soon thereafter, the legendary Alfred Cortot proclaimed: \\"With this kind of tone, with the ability of his fingers, he could become very important for the history of piano playing.\\" At the age of 18, he was among the first Latin Americans to be invited to participate in the prestigious Casals Music Festival in Puerto Rico. International attention grew in 1961 when, aged 20, he performed at his debut concert in Washington, D.C., Bach's 48 Preludes and Fugues from the Well-Tempered Clavier (a work that became one of his specialties). The reviewers were ecstatic. He was already well-known in Brazil as a child prodigy, and his name quickly spread throughout the concert world. Three years later he made his New York debut, followed by engagements with major orchestras in the United States, and recitals throughout the world, including sold-out performances at Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall (Lincoln Center). Performing and conducting career His hands Recordings of Book I & II of the Well-Tempered Clavier, for the Connoisseur Society label, followed soon thereafter and in 1968 RCA released Alberto Ginastera's Piano Concerto with Martins and the Boston Symphony under Erich Leinsdorf: a widely acclaimed first recording of this work, which appeared for weeks on Billboard's best seller list. He became a regular at the Peabody Mason Concert series and Boston Symphony. Between 1979 and 1998, Martins devoted himself to recording Bach's complete works for keyboard on the Concord Concerto and Labor Records labels. His collection of the complete keyboard works of Bach - a 20 CD edition released on the Concord Concerto label, and the most extensive series of Bach keyboard recordings by a single pianist - resulted in spectacular reviews throughout the world, including feature articles and cover stories in some of the most prestigious music magazines.http://www.laborrecords.com/bachmartins.html In 1981, he was appointed Brazil's Secretary of Culture. Afflicted by injuries and setbacks throughout his mercurial career, Martins has shown remarkable perseverance and determination. While visiting Bulgaria in 1995, Martins was attacked by two thugs, receiving injuries to his skull and brain, and lost the use of his right arm. After undergoing numerous treatments, including a new version of biofeedback therapy on his right arm, he played a triumphant comeback concert in Carnegie Hall in 1996, appearing as soloist with the American Symphony Orchestra, performing Ravel and Ginastera. In early 2000, he underwent an unsuccessful operation in his right hand, which rendered his hand essentially useless. Instead of retiring completely from the piano, Martins continued to play using his left hand and one finger of the right hand. After his career as a pianist finished due to problems which later developed in his left hand, he turned to conducting, despite very limited hand-movements. Since then he has led hundreds of performances worldwide including acclaimed concerts at Carnegie Hall. In 2020, he returned to playing with both hands with the help of a pair of bionic gloves. They were especially developed for him by the Brazilian industrial designer Ubiratan Bizarro Costa.https://apnews.com/article/bae1a2b1e29ad6cfa5020c03344e1c8e Harold C. Schonberg, Pulitzer-winning music critic of the New York Times, said, \\"His technique sends fireworks in all directions... he does everything with extraordinary √©lan.\\" The Boston Globe characterized him as \\"The most exciting player of Bach on the modern piano to emerge since Glenn Gould,\\" and National Public Radio described Martins' Bach as \\"in the same tradition of, say, Furtw√§ngler's Beethoven or Bernstein's Brahms. The pianist has placed such a vivid stamp on the material that it is no longer the composer's alone‚Ä¶ It's literally breathtaking.‚Äù Books and films In 2001 a book, entitled \\"Conversations with Martins\\", was published about his life and career. It was written by noted pianist and Juilliard School professor David Dubal, to coincide with Jo√£o's new recordings of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. In 2004 a German documentary was released, Die Martins-Passion (96 min), which won several international awards. The film accompanies Martins during his darkest hours, tracing the early triumphs and dramatic events of his life. It portrays film sequences from his childhood and early years, as well as some of his most impressive performances. In the movie, Martins encounters some of his friends including the soccer player Pel√© and the legendary jazz pianist Dave Brubeck. A biographical drama film, \\"Jo√£o, O Maestro\\" (Jo√£o, The Conductor), was directed by Bruno Barreto and stars Alexandre Nero and Rodrigo Pandolfo as Martins at adult and young age respectively, and Alinne Moraes as Carmen, his current wife. The movie was launched worldwide in August, 2017. Awards and outreach Martins is known for initiating social programs for underprivileged youth in Brazil, through his foundation the \\"Funda√ß√£o Bachiana Filarm√¥nica\\", which supports two orchestras that he has founded, the Bachiana Philharmonic Orchestra and the Youth Bachiana Orchestra.http://www.fundacaobachiana.org.br/ External links * Official site * BACH & friends Documentary References Category:Brazilian classical pianists Category:Classical pianists who played with one arm Category:Brazilian conductors (music) Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century conductors (music) Category:21st- century classical pianists Category:21st-century Brazilian musicians Category:21st-century male musicians Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century Brazilian musicians Category:20th-century male musicians Category:Male conductors (music) Category:Male classical pianists Category:Brazilian expatriates in the United States ","title":"Jo√£o Carlos Martins"},{"id":"3660272","text":"In some versions of Norse mythology, V√°li was one of the unlucky sons of Loki.

Now Loki was taken truceless, and was brought with them into a certain cave. Thereupon they took three flat stones, and set them on edge and drilled a hole in each stone. Then were taken Loki's sons, V√°li and Nari or Narfi; the √Üsir changed V√°li into the form of a wolf, and he tore asunder Narfi his brother. And the √Üsir took his entrails and bound Loki with them over the three stones: one stands under his shoulders, the second under his loins, the third under his houghs; and those bonds were turned to iron. -- Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur's translationArthur Gilchrist Brodeur, tr., The Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson, Scandinavian Classics 5, New York: The American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1916, (repr. Charleston, South Carolina: BiblioBazaar, 2008, ), pp. 76-77.  } V√°li, son of Loki, is otherwise unknown. A variant version in the Hauksb√≥k manuscript of stanza 34 of \\"V√∂lusp√°\\" refers to this event; it begins: \\"√û√° kn√° V√°la  v√≠gb«´nd sn√∫a\\", usually amended to the nominative V√°li in order to provide a subject for the verb; in Ursula Dronke's translation in her edition of the poem, \\"Then did V√°li  slaughter bonds twist\\".Ursula Dronke (ed. and trans.), The Poetic Edda Volume II: Mythological Poems, Oxford: Oxford University/Clarendon, 1997, repr. 2001, , p. 76. This presumably refers to V√°li, son of √ì√∞inn, who was begotten to avenge Baldr's death, and thus it is not unlikely that he bound Loki; but the Hauksb√≥k stanza interrupts the flow of \\"V√∂lusp√°\\" at this point and presumably draws on a variant oral tradition. It is likely that this was Snorri's source,John Lindow, Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs, Oxford/New York: Oxford University, 2001, , p. 309. and that he interpreted the manuscript text V√°la v√≠gb«´nd as \\"bonds from V√°li's act of slaughter\\", thus inventing a second V√°li. In the rather cryptic prose at the end of \\"Lokasenna\\", which appears to be derived from Snorri's account, Narfi transforms into a wolf and his brother Nari's guts are used to bind their father.Dronke, pp. 347, 371-72.

History Centipede was formed by Keith Tippett in 1970 to perform an extended composition, Septober Energy that he had been working on. The members were drawn from his own band at the time, The Keith Tippett Group, several British progressive rock, jazz- rock and avant-garde jazz groups, including Soft Machine (Robert Wyatt, Elton Dean, Nick Evans, Mark Charig), Nucleus (Karl Jenkins, Ian Carr, Brian Smith, Jeff Clyne, Roy Babbington, Bryan Spring, John Stanley Marshall) and King Crimson (Robert Fripp, Peter Sinfield, Ian McDonald, Boz Burrell), and students of the London School of Music. Septober Energy consisted of four movements, or \\"concepts\\" that the band improvised around. It was first performed by the band live at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 15 November 1970. Centipede toured France in November 1970, giving two \\"memorable performances\\" at the Alhambra Theatre in Bordeaux. They also played for the Rotterdam Arts Council in the Netherlands, at the Lanchester Arts Festival and the Bristol University Student Union. Centipede's concerts attracted \\"uneven reviews\\", with some critics calling Tippett's music \\"long and leaden\\", and others praising it as a \\"bold extension\\" of what Tippett and his band were already doing. In April 1971, Neon Records, a British sub-label of RCA in the United States, signed up Tippett and Centipede, and Centipede recorded Tippett's composition on a double album, Septober Energy in June that year. Robert Fripp produced the album and it was released in October 1971 in the United Kingdom only. Tippett had featured prominently on three of King Crimson's albums (In the Wake of Poseidon, Lizard and Islands) and Fripp had even invited Tippett to join the band (he declined). While some of the other Crimson members featured on Septober Energy, Fripp, who had performed live with Centipede, did not. Centipede, now reduced in size for economic reasons, gave two performances in London to promote the album, one at the Royal Albert Hall in October 1971, and the other at the Rainbow Theatre in December 1971. But the album was not generally well received by critics and as no further engagements were forthcoming, Centipede disbanded at the end of 1971. In 1974 RCA issued Septober Energy in the United States, hoping to cash in on Fripp's name as the producer, but it failed, particularly because Centipede did not exist to promote the album with performances. The band did, however, reform briefly in October 1975, with David Cross from King Crimson, to perform at several French jazz festivals. Tippett said in a January 2003 interview that in 1970 the Centipede project was \\"quite innocent\\" and that \\"no-one was doing it for the money\\". Their debut performance at the Lyceum was a benefit concert for the Jazz Centre Society. Tippett said that at the time there was considerable interest in the project, and that while the initial performance consisted of 50 musicians, \\"there could have been 100\\". Tippett later instigated The Ark, another large big band jazz project that recorded the album Frames (Music For An Imaginary Film) for Ogun Records in 1978.

IBP garnered national attention when it was featured on the cover of American Theatre in September, 2002, for its original play, We Have Some Planes, by Brian Jucha, about the events of September 11. The theater's name is taken from a line in one of its first productions, In the Jungle of Cities by Bertolt Brecht. The line reads, \\"In my dreams I call him my infernal bridegroom.\\" IBP produced over 60 plays, many of them world premieres. About the company The Houston Theater District is the second largest in the United States, after New York, New York, boasting theaters of all sizes, from the LORT Alley Theatre, to midsize theaters such as Stages Repertory Theatre and Main Street Theater, and small nomadic theaters such as Mildred's Umbrella. Infernal Bridegroom Productions ceased operations in July 2007 due to insurmountable financial difficulties. Founded in 1993 by Jason Nodler and Jim Parsons, IBP produced 68 plays and was recognized locally and nationally for its provocative new work, its talented ensemble and its success in attracting non-traditional audiences. Nodler was artistic director until 2003 when he left to travel the country. Associate artistic director Anthony Barilla became artistic director until moving out of the country in 2007. Nodler returned to Houston to found The Catastrophic Theatre with Tamarie Cooper later in that year. The company's 2006 world premiere rock opera Speeding Motorcycle, created in collaboration with acclaimed artist and songwriter Daniel Johnston, received favorable coverage in The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/arts/music/14spee.html Art in America, No Depression magazine, the Austin Chronicle and local media outlets. Past works also received positive coverage from American Theatre, Theatre Journal, Stage Directions and the Dallas Morning News. IBP appeared regularly in the annual Houston Press \\"Best of Houston\\" issue, receiving awards for Best Theater Company, New Play, Original Show, Director, Actor, Actress, Set Design, Light Design, Costume Design, Special Effects, Christmas Show and Rock and Roll Theater. And the Houston Chronicle called IBP Houston's best experimental theater. IBP enjoyed a large and loyal audience as well as regularly attracting out-of-towners that travelled to Houston specifically to see the company's work. The company was acclaimed for its productions of rarely produced plays by Samuel Beckett, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Bertolt Brecht, Georg B√ºchner, Jean Genet, Anton Chekhov, Sam Shepard and David Mamet and was the first to introduce Houston audiences to the works of playwrights Suzan-Lori Parks, Maria Irene Fornes, Sarah Kane, Heiner M√ºller, Wallace Shawn, Charles Mee, Richard Foreman, Mac Wellman and Bernard-Marie Kolt√®s. IBP also attracted national attention for the theatrical premiere of A Soap Opera by Ray Davies and The Kinks and was lauded for its hit production of Broadway musical Guys and Dolls. But IBP was perhaps best known for the new work it created. Highlights included Fucking A, commissioned by IBP and DiverseWorks Artspace and written and directed by Pulitzer Prize winner Suzan-Lori Parks; We Have Some Planes and Last Rites, conceived and directed by renowned theater artist Brian Jucha; Hide Town, commissioned by the NEA and TCG and written by Lisa D'Amour; Speeding Motorcycle, commissioned by the Rockefeller Foundation and conceived and directed by IBP founding artistic director Jason Nodler in collaboration with Daniel Johnston and the IBP company; Nodler's original plays In the Under Thunderloo, King Ubu is King and Meatbar; company member Troy Schulze's Me-sci-ah, Jerry's World (adapted from the radio shows of cult figure Joe Frank) and Actual Air (adapted from the poetry and music of Silver Jews frontman David Berman); founding company member Tamarie Cooper's 20 Love Songs and the wildly popular Tamalalia series created and directed by Cooper. Although IBP was in residence at the legendary punk club The Axiom for five years, it spent nine years as a homeless company, performing in warehouses, bars, restaurants, aboard a moving school bus, in an abandoned outdoor shopping center and occasionally in traditional theater spaces such as Stages Repertory Theatre and DiverseWorks. Music composed and recorded by IBP's resident orchestra, under the direction of former artistic director Anthony Barilla, has enjoyed regular radio play on college stations around the country and on NPR's This American Life. The orchestra also recorded original music for IBP.

It stands on the south-western shore of Bassenthwaite Lake. Barf is well known for a whitewashed pillar of rock on the lower slopes, the so-called \\"Bishop's Rock\\" or \\"Bishop of Barf\\". The name is thought to be a derivative of \\"burgh\\". Topography Barf is properly an eastern shoulder of Lord's Seat, but was accorded the status of a separate fell by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): The eastern face is a steep wall of scree, falling to the Keswick to Cockermouth road and the lakeshore. The southern boundary of the fell is Beckstones Gill, falling over a series of small waterfalls from near the summit of Lord's Seat. At the base of the slope it flows past the former Swan Hotel and into the head of the lake. To the south of Barf are Ullister Hill and Seat How, satellites of Lord's Seat which Wainwright chose to leave within the bounds of the parent fell. To the north of Barf is an unnamed stream falling to the lakeshore at Woodend, beyond which the land slowly falls away to Beck Wythop. To the north and south of the BARF fell's borders the slopes are forested with conifers, but Barf itself remains bare barring a belt of deciduous woodland at the very bottom. The eastern face begins with several hundred feet of shifting scree, giving way to rough and loose crags higher up; Slape Crag is the main face. The whole slope falls some 900 ft in a quarter of a mile. The connection to Lord's Seat is via a broad heather-clad depression to the west of the summit, easy walking being possible although there are some boggy patches. The Bishop of Barf The Bishop of Barf On a rocky site at 700 ft and clearly visible from the Cockermouth to Keswick road, is the \\"Bishop of Barf\\", a white painted stone marking the spot where, according to local legend, the Bishop of Derry was killed falling from his horse in 1783, after drunkenly betting he could ride up the hill. Both the Bishop and his horse are said to be buried near a smaller stone, the Clerk, at the base of the hill. Sadly, the story, although imaginative, forgets that the Bishop of Derry of the time died 20 years later in Italy. However, this Bishop's colourful life no doubt inspired a tale capable of capturing the imagination. The stone was whitewashed each year by staff at the nearby Swan Hotel, until the Hotel was converted to apartments. The whitewashing is now carried out by members of Keswick Mountain Rescue. The Bishop stands about 7 ft high on the shortest side, while the Clerk is a much smaller conical stone.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Geology Barf is a part of the Loweswater Formation of Ordovician rocks. This is composed of Greywacke sandstone turbidities. The lower eastern slopes show outcropping of the Kirkstile Formation, the typical rock of the Skiddaw group.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There is evidence of historic mining activity on the north bank of Beckstones Gill, below the east face and also near Woodend. Small amounts of lead and zinc were raised between 1532 and 1891, the principal ores being blende, cerussite and galena.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit The summit is a small platform with a thin covering of grass, only a little way back from the eastern slope. The view eastward to Skiddaw and Longside Edge is excellent, with Bassenthwaite Lake in the foreground. A selection of the Eastern and Southern Fells can also be seen. Lord's Seat blocks much of the panorama westward although the sea makes an appearance. Ascents The direct assault via the Bishop is described by Wainwright as \\"Not a walk. A very stiff scramble, suitable only for people overflowing with animal strength and vigour.\\". A line further to the south following Beckstones Gill is perhaps to be preferred. Barf can easily be gained indirectly, having first ascended Lord's Seat.

Following a vacancy, Quakers in Britain nominated Hannah Brock Womack for the Presidency, and the Fourth Presidency Group agreed the appointment. However, as stated by CTE, \\"the Member Churches of CTE, through the Enabling Group, have recently requested the Fourth Presidency Group to refrain from enacting its Presidency at this time, leaving the Fourth Presidency as an ‚Äòempty chair‚Äô for the current term of office.\\" In a concurrent announcement, Quakers in Britain stated that \\"The Churches have rejected the Quakers' appointee Hannah Brock Womack, because she is married to a woman. An active Quaker, she is a young, radical peace activist, who campaigns against the arms trade and works in the voluntary sector.\\" In response, the United Reformed Church noted with deep sadness the inability of CTE to confirm the appointment, and called for dialogue to \\"continue until a more just outcome can be reached.\\" The Methodist Church recognised the pain and shared the grief caused by the decision, and stated that the outcome does not represent the Methodist position that being in a same-sex marriage is no bar to roles within the Church, while acknowledging that not all churches agree with this position. The convenor of the General Council of the Student Christian Movement, Tom Packer-Stucki, declared that \\"we stand in solidarity with Hannah Brock Womack and the Quaker movement in this difficult time\\" and called on CTE to \\"work together ecumenically to reach agreement about LGBTQ+ inclusion that is truly inclusive\\". In a June 2020 interview, Hannah Brock Womack revealed that despite her presidency being blocked because of her same-sex marriage, she convenes meetings in the Fourth Presidency Group of CTE. She said: \\"I'm sad that I can't contribute. Coming from a non-hierarchical Church, and as the only woman in the group, I wanted to speak for those not usually represented, and for a radical and inclusive faith.\\" Member Churches The 50 The announcement https://www.cte.org.uk/Articles/559995/Home/News/Latest_news/CTE_statement_on.aspx states there are 51 member churches, as of December 2019. member churches of CTE are listed at www.cte.org.uk/MemberChurches.

The British Council of Churches had itself been formed in 1942. A National Free Church Council had come into being during the 1890s. A Federal Council of the Evangelical Free Churches was formed in 1916 as a more authoritative and representative body. These two merged in 1939 as the Free Church Federal Council. A significant landmark was the 1910 World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh. External links * The Story of the BCC - follow the pilgrim road by Colin Davey and Alan Dawkins.

The famous Schrafft's neon sign is a significant landmark in Boston, although the former factory it sits above, constructed in 1928, has been redeveloped for business accommodation. Schrafft's later expanded to form a chain of Schrafft's restaurants in New York, and a collection of motor inns and restaurants along the eastern seaboard from New England to Florida during the 1950s and 1960s. History Schrafft's was founded as a candy company by William F. Schrafft in Boston, in 1861. Frank Shattuck took over in 1898, expanding the company to include restaurants. By 1915, they had nine stores in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn, and one in Syracuse, NY, as well as the facility in Boston. They had grown to 22 stores in 1923, 42 stores in 1934,Fast Food: Roadside Restaurants in the United States and 55 stores in 1968.Time magazine October 25, 1968, \\"Schrafft's Gets With It\\" Schrafft's sponsored the 1959 CBS telecast of The Wizard of Oz,Wizard of Oz Holiday Broadcasts the first of the film's annual telecasts (it had been shown once before on television in 1956). PET milk purchased Schrafft's in 1967, breaking the ice cream, restaurant and cake, and candy operations into separate companies. The ice cream is produced under license by the company. In 1968, in an attempt to broaden their customer base, Schrafft's commissioned a 60-second television commercial from pop artist Andy Warhol. The company's former candy factory in Boston was turned into commercial office space. Located at 529 Main Street, Charlestown, Massachusetts, it is known as the Schrafft Center and owned by the Flatley Company. Among its tenants are Business Valuation Resources, Boston Digital, Fitcorp, All IT Supported, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, Beacon Hospice, iCorps Technology, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Newton Scientific, Telemundo Boston, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. in 2019, James Byrne, a Godson of the Shattucks, the founding family of Schrafft's Restaurants, announced the return of the brand with plans to open brick-and-mortar retail in the near term.

For two residues i and j, the ij element of the matrix is 1 if the two residues are closer than a predetermined threshold, and 0 otherwise. Various contact definitions have been proposed: The distance between the CŒ±-CŒ± atom with threshold 6-12 √Ö; distance between CŒ≤-CŒ≤ atoms with threshold 6-12 √Ö (CŒ± is used for Glycine); and distance between the side-chain centers of mass. Overview Contact maps provide a more reduced representation of a protein structure than its full 3D atomic coordinates. The advantage is that contact maps are invariant to rotations and translations. They are more easily predicted by machine learning methods. It has also been shown that under certain circumstances (e.g. low content of erroneously predicted contacts) it is possible to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of a protein using its contact map. Contact maps are also used for protein superimposition and to describe similarity between protein structures. They are either predicted from protein sequence or calculated from a given structure.  Contact map prediction  With the availability of high numbers of genomic sequences it becomes feasible to analyze such sequences for coevolving residues. The effectiveness of this approach results from the fact that a mutation in position i of a protein is more likely to be associated with a mutation in position j than with a back- mutation in i if both positions are functionally coupled (e.g. by taking part in an enzymatic domain, or by being adjacent in a folded protein, or even by being adjacent in an oligomer of that protein). Several statistical methods exist to extract from a multiple sequence alignment such coupled residue pairs: observed versus expected frequencies of residue pairs (OMES); the McLachlan Based Substitution correlation (McBASC); statistical coupling analysis; Mutual Information (MI) based methods; and recently direct coupling analysis (DCA). Machine learning algorithms have been able to enhance MSA analysis methods, especially for non-homologous proteins (ie. shallow MSA's). Predicted contact maps have been used in the prediction of membrane proteins where helix-helix interactions are targeted. HB Plot Knowledge of the relationship between a protein's structure and its dynamic behavior is essential for understanding protein function. The description of a protein three dimensional structure as a network of hydrogen bonding interactions (HB plot) was introduced as a tool for exploring protein structure and function. By analyzing the network of tertiary interactions, the possible spread of information within a protein can be investigated. HB plot offers a simple way of analyzing protein secondary structure and tertiary structure. Hydrogen bonds stabilizing secondary structural elements (secondary hydrogen bonds) and those formed between distant amino acid residues - defined as tertiary hydrogen bonds - can be easily distinguished in HB plot, thus, amino acid residues involved in stabilizing protein structure and function can be identified. =Features= The plot distinguishes between main chain-main chain, main chain-side chain and side chain-side chain hydrogen bonding interactions. Bifurcated hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrogen bonds between amino acid residues; and intra- and interchain hydrogen bonds are also indicated on the plots. Three classes of hydrogen bondings are distinguished by color-coding; short (distance smaller than 2.5 √Ö between donor and acceptor), intermediate (between 2.5 √Ö and 3.2 √Ö) and long hydrogen bonds (greater than 3.2 √Ö). =Secondary structure elements in HB plot= 300px In representations of the HB plot, characteristic patterns of secondary structure elements can be recognised easily, as follows: #Helices can be identified as strips directly adjacent to the diagonal. #Antiparallel beta sheets appear in HB plot as cross-diagonal. #Parallel beta sheets appears in the HB plot as parallel to the diagonal. #Loops appear as breaks in the diagonal between the cross-diagonal beta-sheet motifs. =Examples of usage= Cytochrome P450s The cytochrome P450s (P450s) are xenobiotic-metabolizing membrane- bound heme-containing enzymes that use molecular oxygen and electrons from NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase to oxidize their substrates. CYP2B4, a member of the cytochrome P450 family is the only protein within this family, whose X-ray structure in both open 11 and closed form 12 is published. The comparison of the open and closed structures of CYP2B4 structures reveals large-scale conformational rearrangement between the two states, with the greatest conformational change around the residues 215-225, which is widely open in ligand-free state and shut after ligand binding; and the region around loop C near the heme. HB Plot and structure of Cytochrome P450 2B4 in closed form Examining the HB plot of the closed and open state of CYP2B4 revealed that the rearrangement of tertiary hydrogen bonds was in excellent agreement with the current knowledge of the cytochrome P450 catalytic cycle. The first step in P450 catalytic cycle is identified as substrate binding. Preliminary binding of a ligand near to the entrance breaks hydrogen bonds S212-E474, S207-H172 in the open form of CYP2B4 and hydrogen bonds E218-A102, Q215-L51 are formed that fix the entrance in the closed form as the HB plot reveals. The second step is the transfer of the first electron from NADPH via an electron transfer chain. For the electron transfer a conformational change occurs that triggers interaction of the P450 with the NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. Breaking of hydrogen bonds between S128-N287, S128-T291, L124-N287 and forming S96-R434, A116-R434, R125-I435, D82-R400 at the NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase binding site--as seen in HB plot--transform CYP2B4 to a conformation state, where binding of NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase occurs. In the third step, oxygen enters CYP2B4 in the closed state - the state where newly formed hydrogen bonds S176-T300, H172-S304, N167-R308 open a tunnel which is exactly the size and shape of an oxygen molecule. =Lipocalin family= 300px The lipocalin family is a large and diverse family of proteins with functions as small hydrophobic molecule transporters. Beta-lactoglobulin is a typical member of the lipocalin family. Beta-lactoglobulin was found to have a role in the transport of hydrophobic ligands such as retinol or fatty acids. Its crystal structure were determined [e.g. Qin, 1998] with different ligands and in ligand-free form as well. The crystal structures determined so far reveal that the typical lipocalin contains eight-stranded antiparallel- barrel arranged to form a conical central cavity in which the hydrophobic ligand is bound. The structure of beta-lactoglobulin reveals that the barrel- form structure with the central cavity of the protein has an \\"entrance\\" surrounded by five beta-loops with centers around 26, 35, 63, 87, and 111, which undergo a conformational change during the ligand binding and close the cavity. The overall shape of beta-lactoglobulin is characteristic of the lipocalin family. In the absence of alpha-helices, the main diagonal almost disappears and the cross-diagonals representing the beta-sheets dominate the plot. Relatively low number of tertiary hydrogen bonds can be found in the plot, with three high-density regions, one of which is connected to a loop at the residues around 63, a second is connected to the loop around 87, and a third region which is connected to the regions 26 and 35. The fifth loop around 111 is represented only one tertiary hydrogen bond in the HB plot. In the three-dimensional structure, tertiary hydrogen bonds are formed (1) near to the entrance, directly involved in conformational rearrangement during ligand binding; and (2) at the bottom of the \\"barrel\\". HB plots of the open and closed forms of beta-lactoglobulin are very similar, all unique motifs can be recognized in both forms. Difference in HB plots of open and ligand-bound form show few important individual changes in tertiary hydrogen bonding pattern. Especially, the formation of hydrogen bonds between Y20-E157 and S21-H161 in closed form might be crucial in conformational rearrangement. These hydrogen bonds lie at the bottom of the cavity, which suggests that the closure of the entrance of a lipocalin starts when a ligand reached the bottom of the cavity and broke hydrogen bonds R123-Y99, R123-T18, and V41-Q120. Lipocalins are known to have very low sequence similarity with high structural similarity. The only conserved regions are exactly the region around 20 and 160 with an unknown role. 700px See also * Ramachandran plot * Structural classification of proteins * CATH * HB plot * Dot plot (bioinformatics) * Self-similarity matrix References External links *DISTILL-- prediction of protein structural features (including protein residue contact maps) *Structural Proteomics Tools -- includes amino acid contact maps *ProfCon -- prediction of inter-residue contacts *TMHcon -- prediction of helix-helix contacts specifically within the transmembrane parts of membrane proteins *TMhit -- A new transmembrane helix-helix interaction prediction method based on residue contacts *CMAPpro -- A protein contact map prediction server *CMPyMOL --A Tool for Protein Contact-Map Visualization in PyMOL Category:Proteomics Category:Protein structure ","title":"Protein contact map"},{"id":"3660386","title":"Worcester City F.C."},{"id":"3660392","text":"Devils is the seventh studio album by the gothic rock band The 69 Eyes released 22 October 2004, Virgin / EMI.

She was born in Melbourne, Australia. She works on German history of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, and has written a biography of Martin Luther. Her research centres on gender and the Reformation, witchcraft, and visual culture. In 2011 she was appointed to Regius Chair of History (founded 1724) at the University of Oxford, the first woman (and first Australian) to hold this esteemed position. Education and academic promotions Roper graduated from the University of Melbourne in History and Philosophy in 1977 after which she received the first Caltex Woman Graduate of the Year scholarship and an additional scholarship from the University Women Graduates‚Äô association. An award from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) allowed her to undertake study in Germany. During her initial nearly two years in Germany, Roper studied with Heiko Oberman at the University of T√ºbingen, and worked with Ingrid Batori and Hans-Christoph Rublack. She then moved to King‚Äôs College London where in 1985 she completed her PhD, supervised by Robert W. Scribner. Before completing her doctorate, Roper began a Junior Research Fellowship at Merton College at the University of Oxford (1983-6). In 1986 she took up a non-permanent Lectureship at King‚Äôs College London, and moved in 1987 to a permanent post at Royal Holloway, University of London, becoming Professor in 1999 and establishing (with Amanda Vickery) the first Master‚Äôs programme in Women‚Äôs and Gender History. She has been Fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (1991-2) and has held Visiting positions at the Eisenberg Centre, Ann Arbor, the University of Western Australia, the Australian National University, Canberra, the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, and the Max Planck Institut, G√∂ttingen. In 2002 she took up a Lectureship and Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford. She is currently Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Oriel College. She is an Honorary Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, and of Balliol College, Oxford. Professional life In 2016, Roper won the Gerda Henkel Prize for lifetime achievement in History. Currently she holds a Humboldt Research Award (associated with the Free University Berlin) for research in Germany. She is Honorary Fellow of the History Department, University of Melbourne, Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (2009), Fellow of the British Academy (2011), and Fellow of the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin (2016). She also holds an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Melbourne. Books =Martin Luther: Renegade and Prophet= Roper‚Äôs Martin Luther: Renegade and Prophet, has been translated into German, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Czech and Dutch; in Germany it became a best-seller. Published to coincide with the 500th anniversary of the posting of the 95 Theses and the start of the Reformation, Roper‚Äôs biography is the first to locate Luther within his social and cultural context, foregrounding his physicality and thus seeking to understand his theology in new ways. The work was shortlisted for both the Wolfson History Prize and the Elizabeth Longford Prize. =The Witch in the Western Imagination= Exploring how witches and witchcraft have been portrayed through art and literature, The Witch in the Western Imagination builds on Roper‚Äôs previous works to explain why witches are so often represented as old hags. Yet the figure of the witch is not always portrayed in a negative light, and she might be an individual who could stand up to authority and even represent the community itself. By delving into the importance of ‚Äòfantasy‚Äô to the interpretation of witches and witchcraft, Roper‚Äôs nuanced study interprets ‚Äòhow individuals made sense of witchcraft, why the figure of the witch could arouse such intense emotion, and why she could be used in so many ways.‚Äô =Witch Craze: Terror and Fantasy in Baroque Germany= Witch Craze explores the role of unconscious fantasy in history by taking four case studies of witch hunting in southern Germany, the region with the highest number of executions of people accused as witches. Using extensive archival sources, including original trial transcripts, the book studies the psychology of witch-hunting, arguing that what powered these witch-hunts were fears surrounding fertility. Roper examines ‚Äòwhy it was mostly older women that were the victims of witch crazes, why they confessed to crimes, and how the depiction of witches in art and literature has influenced the characterization of elderly women in our own culture.‚Äô The book has been translated into German with Beck (Hexenwahn: Geschichte einer Verfolgung) and was awarded the Roland H Bainton Prize in 2005. =Oedipus and the Devil: Witchcraft, Religion and Sexuality in Early Modern Europe= A collection of nine interconnected essays, Oedipus and the Devil explores subjects ranging from the literary culture of the sixteenth century, to early-modern sexual attitudes and ideas regarding femininity and masculinity, to issues surrounding the complex development of marriage, and the use of psychoanalysis in studying witchcraft. Roper examines why a woman would kill her child, why someone would confess to living with the devil like husband and wife, and why a famous banker might employ a village clairvoyant (‚ÄòDorf hellseherin‚Äô). The work has been translated into German with Fischer Taschenbuch (√ñdipus und der Teufel: K√∂rper und Psyche in der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit) and is widely cited. =The Holy Household: Women and Morals in Reformation Augsburg= Roper‚Äôs first book questioned the ways in which the Reformation changed gender relations, focussing on the case study of Augsburg, one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire. Exploring the idea of ‚Äòcivic righteousness,‚Äô Roper argued that the Reformation developed a theology of gender whereby the roles of men and women were clearly distinct within the vision of the ‚Äòholy household.‚Äô Whilst previously the effect of the Reformation on women was regarded as beneficial, this book argues that the status of women was instead worsened. The book has been translated into German and has been reprinted several times. Currently Roper is writing a history of the German Peasants' War (1524-5).

Count Georg Friedrich von Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim (September 5, 1569 ‚Äì July 7, 1645) was an officer and an amateur poet. Biography Born in Neuenstein, Georg Friedrich was the son of Count Wolfgang of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein and his wife Magdalena von Nassau-Dillenburg. At the age of 17, in 1586 Count Georg Friedrich went to the University of Geneva and studied there until 1588. He was probably the last student of Professor Fran√ßois Hotman. Subsequently, for the purpose of study, Count Georg Friedrich went to France and later to Italy, where he enrolled at the universities of Siena and Padua. After finishing his studies, in 1591 he fought under Henry IV of France against the Catholic League. In the war against the Turks in 1595, he was promoted to Colonel. In 1605, as imperial field commander, he put down an uprising in Hungary. On June 18, 1607, Friedrich married Eva von Waldstein. Through this marriage he became a member of the Bohemian Estates and thereby also became involved in the resistance against King (Holy Roman Emperor) Ferdinand II. As General commander of the Estates, he was responsible for organization and in the Battle of White Mountain he commanded a cavalry unit. On January 22, 1621, he was accepted as a member of the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft by Prince Ludwig I of Anhalt-K√∂then. In 1621, Emperor Ferdinand II proclaimed Frederick V of the Palatinate and others to be traitors. The others included Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim. In spite of having fallen under the proclamation of imperial banishment in 1621, Count Georg Friedrich was able to achieve peace with the emperor and with imperial approval was even able to exercise his lordship in Weikersheim, which had fallen to him at the death of his father in 1610. His wife Eva died May 24, 1631. On August 17, 1633, he married Maria Magdalena von Oettingen-Oettingen, who however died on May 29, 1636, after a barely three-year-long marriage. In 1632, Count Georg Friedrich was installed as the Swedish regent of the Swabian Circle. When he accepted this post, he infuriated the emperor to the point that he immediately outlawed him again. Additionally, the Teutonic Order immediately, by imperial decree, received the lordship of Weikersheim. This was only returned to the House of Hohenlohe after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Due to his outlawry, Georg Friedrich was excluded from the Peace of Prague [1635]. Nevertheless, during a personal conversation in 1637, the emperor forgave him. Count Georg Friedrich settled in Langenburg and avoided every form of political activity. Here in Langenburg he was also active in literature. He wrote primarily prayers and poems. Count Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim died on August 7, 1645, at the age of 76 years, in Langenburg.

It was founded as a tertiary college in 1987 and changed its status to a sixth form college in 2010.  History and origins  The college's roots date back to 1604, when the Free Grammar School of King James I was founded at the Chantry House in Henley. The charity school, which was more vocational than academic, was endowned by Dame Elizabeth Periam in 1609. The two schools were amalgamated in 1778. The two colleges from which The Henley College was formed, King James's College and the South Oxfordshire Technical College, were controlled by Oxfordshire County Council. The merger of the two led in 1987 to a newly incorporated tertiary college responsible to the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) for running its own affairs. In 2010 the college applied for sixth form college status, which was granted. The college today The college offers a range of academic and vocational courses including more than 60 A-Levels, BTEC and other courses and also a number of vocational and part-time day and evening courses. Among the sports on offer are rugby union, football, basketball, netball and rowing. College rugby is linked with the London Wasps academy. A recently completed sports hall has been built at a cost of ¬£2 million. Since its foundation the college has more than doubled in size and its catchment area has extended to cover a large part of the Thames Valley. The college achieved national Beacon College status in 2010. The college consists of two campuses, Deanfield and Rotherfield. A third campus, Southfield, was demolished in 1998 and the land sold to fund improvements to the rest of the site, notably a new building on the Deanfield campus.

It frequently hosts travelling international exhibitions. Set below the hilltop Albert Park in the central-city area of Auckland, the gallery was established in 1888 as the first permanent art gallery in New Zealand. The building originally housed the Auckland Art Gallery as well as the Auckland public library opening with collections donated by benefactors Governor Sir George Grey and James Tannock Mackelvie. This was the second public art gallery in New Zealand opened three years after the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in 1884. Wellington's New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts opened in 1892 and a Wellington Public Library in 1893. In 2009, it was announced that the museum received a donation from American businessman Julian Robertson, valued at over $100 million, the largest ever of its kind in the region. The works will be received from the owner's estate. History Throughout the 1870s many people in Auckland felt the city needed a municipal art collection but the newly established Auckland City Council was unwilling to commit funds to such a project. Following pressure by such eminent people as Sir Maurice O'Rorke (Speaker of the House of Representatives) and others, the building of a combined Art Gallery & Library was made necessary by the promise of significant bequests from two major benefactors; former colonial governor Sir George Grey, and James Tannock Mackelvie. Grey had promised books for a municipal library as early as 1872 and eventually donated large numbers of manuscripts, rare books and paintings from his collection to the Auckland Gallery & Library [in all over 12,500 items, including 53 paintings]. He also gave material to Cape Town, where he had also been governor. The Grey bequest includes works by Caspar Netscher, Henry Fuseli, William Blake and David Wilkie. Mackelvie was a businessman who had retained an interest in Auckland affairs after returning to Britain. In the early 1880s he announced a gift of 105 framed watercolours, oil paintings, and a collection of drawings. His gift eventually amounted to 140 items, including paintings, decorative arts, ceramics and furniture from his London residence, these form the core of the Mackelvie Trust Collection which is shared between the Auckland City Art Gallery, the Public Library and the Auckland Museum. Mackelvie's will stipulated a separate gallery to display his bequest, this was not popular with the city authorities but a special room was dedicated to the collection in 1893 and eventually the top lit Mackelvie Gallery was built in 1916. The Mackelvie Trust continues to purchase art works to add to the collection which now includes significant 20th-century bronzes by Archipenko, Bourdelle, Epstein, Moore and Elisabeth Frink. The collection In Time of Peril, by Lord Leighton, 1897 John Gibb, Low tide, Governor's Bay, 1883 With the extension added on in the 1970s, seen from a nearby parking building. The Auckland Gallery collection was initially dominated by European old master paintings following the standard taste of the 19th century. Today the collection has expanded to include a wider variety of periods, styles and media, and numbers over 15,000 artworks. Many New Zealand and Pacific artists are represented, as well as Europe and material from the Middle Ages to the present day. Notable New Zealand artists with extensive representation include Gretchen Albrecht, Marti Friedlander, C.F. Goldie, Alfred Henry O'Keeffe, Frances Hodgkins, Gottfried Lindauer and Colin McCahon. Some of these works were donated by the artists themselves. In 1915 a collection of paintings of MƒÅori by Gottfried Lindauer was donated to the Gallery by Henry Partridge, an Auckland businessman. He made the gift on the proviso that the people of Auckland raise 10,000 pounds for the Belgium Relief Fund. The money was raised within a few weeks. Another major benefactor was Lucy Carrington Wertheim. Miss Wertheim was an art gallery owner in London and through her support of expatriate artist Frances Hodgkins bestowed on the Auckland Art Gallery a representative collection of British paintings from the interwar period. Her gifts in 1948 and 1950 totalled 154 works by modern British artists, including Christopher Wood, Frances Hodgkins, Phelan Gibb, R. O. Dunlop and Alfred Wallis. The Wertheim collection was initially displayed in a separate room opened by the Mayor J. A. C. Allum on 2 December 1948. In 1953 Rex Nan Kivell donated an important collection of prints, including work by George French Angas, Sydney Parkinson, Nicholas Chevalier, and Augustus Earle. The 1960s saw the arrival of the Watson Bequest, a collection of European medieval art. In 1967 the Spencer collection of early English and New Zealand watercolours was donated, this included early New Zealand views by John Gully, John Hoyt, and John Kinder. In 1982 on the death of Dr Walter Auburn, print collector and valued adviser to the Gallery's prints and drawings department, the Mackelvie Trust received his magnificent collection of over one and a half thousand prints, including work by Callot, Piranesi, della Bella and Hollar. In 1952 Eric Westbrook was appointed as the first full-time director of the Art Gallery (previously the Head Librarian was formally in charge of both the Gallery and Library). He was succeeded in 1955 by Peter Tomory who stayed until 1965. Both men sought to revitalise the Gallery and introduce modern art to a largely conservative public in the face of resistance from a largely hostile City Council. The 1956 Spring Exhibition 'Object and Image' showed works by modern artists such as John Weeks, Louise Henderson, Milan Mrkusich, Colin McCahon, Kase Jackson and Ross Fraser. Other controversial exhibitions, including Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, resulted in serious confrontation between the Council and Tomory, resulting in his resignation. Tomory's intended purchase of Hepworth's Torso II in 1963 (likened by one councillor to 'the buttock of a dead cow') changed the climate of art and culture in New Zealand. Even the conservative NZ Herald pointed out to its readers, \\"It is no function of an Art Gallery to be stuffed with exhibits which everyone can comprehend.\\" The bronze statue was privately bought by local businessman George Wooler and anonymously donated to the Gallery. In 1988, Christopher Johnstone succeeded Rodney Wilson as director. During his 8 years as director major exhibitions included Pablo Picasso: The artist before nature (1989), Rembrandt to Renoir, which attracted a record attendance for an exhibition charge exhibition of 210,000 (1993) and, in 1995, a programme marking the centennial of the artist's visit to the gallery, including the exhibition Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific and a major book: Gauguin and Maori Art. Other achievements during his incumbency were the funding and development of the New Gallery for contemporary art, which opened in 1995, the establishment of Haerewa, the Maori Advisory Group and a significant range of acquisitions for the collection and the Mackelvie Trust including works by including works by Vanessa Bell, John Nash, John Tunnard, Anish Kapoor, Jesus Rafael Soto and Ed Ruscha. In 2009, it was announced that American investor Julian Robertson would donate art valued at $115 million to the Auckland Art Gallery. The donation included works by Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Salvador Dali, Georges Braque, Andre Derain, Fernand Leger, Pierre Bonnard and Henri Fantin-Latour and was the largest of its kind in Australasia. Following the donation, the Kitchener Street rooms were named the Julian and Josie Robertson Galleries. On 4 April 2012, it was announced that the Auckland Art Gallery would join the Google Art project. 'It is a fantastic opportunity to share with the rest of the world some of the best of our New Zealand and international collection,' said RFA Gallery Director Chris Saines.Auckland Art Gallery joins Google Art Project 'People can learn about and enjoy New Zealand art up close even when they are on the other side of the planet.' Auckland Art Gallery has contributed 85 artworks to the project: 56 are from its New Zealand Pacific collection and 29 by international artists. The Gallery's two Senior Curators, Ron Brownson (New Zealand and Pacific Art) and Mary Kisler (Mackelvie Collection, International Art), selected the works. Examples of New Zealand art now available via Google Art Project include Colin McCahon's On Building Bridges (1952) and paintings by Dunedin-born Frances Hodgkins. Buildings After the demolition of the 1970s extension, in 2009. The modern extension completed in 2011. The main gallery building was originally designed by Melbourne architects Grainger & D'Ebro to house not only the art gallery but also the City Council offices, lecture theatre and public library. It is constructed of brick and plaster in an early French Renaissance style and was completed in 1887, with an extension built in 1916.Gallery upgrade reveals the past - Auckland City Harbour News, Friday 2 October 2009 It is three storeys high, with an attic in the steep pitched roofs, and a six-storey clock tower. The building was registered as a Category I heritage item by Heritage New Zealand on 24 November 1983, listed with registration number 92. The new building eventually proved too small to house all the Council departments and overflow space in the Customs House in Customs Street was found to be necessary. Following the completion of the Auckland Town Hall in 1911 all Council departments left the Gallery building allowing expansion of Gallery facilities, including extra workshop space for art classes. Several artists maintained studio space in the complex during the period just after the war; the weaver Ilse von Randow utilised the clock tower rooms and created onsite the Art Gallery Ceremonial curtains, executed as part of the 1950s modernisation. In 1969 the art classes and studios were relocated to Ponsonby where a decommissioned Police Station by John Campbell at 1 Ponsonby Road was relaunched as 'Artstation' which continues the gallery outreach programmes. From 1969 to 1971 the building underwent remodelling and a new wing and sculpture garden were added. This was the result of the lavish Philip Edmiston bequest which had been announced in 1946, which had stipulated the building of a new gallery. In 1971 the Public library was moved to the new Auckland Public Library building by Ewen Wainscott in nearby Lorne Street. In the late 2000s, a major extension was mooted, which caused substantial criticism from some quarters due to its cost, design and the fact that land from Albert Park would be required for the extension. In late 2007, the Gallery closed for extensive renovations, and re-opened on 3 September 2011. During this time of closure, temporary exhibitions were held at the NEW Gallery on the corner of Wellesley and Lorne Streets. The new renovation and expansion of the Gallery creates at least 50 per cent additional display space. In 2008, Council decided to go ahead with the extension, which finished in 2011 for a total of NZ$113 million, of which Auckland City Council contributed just under NZ$50 million. The expansion design by Australian architecture firm FJMT in partnership with Auckland-based Archimedia,Auckland Art Gallery: \\"Architects\\" , retrieved 21 April 2013. increased exhibition space by 50%, for up to 900 artworks, and provided dedicated education, child and family spaces.CityScene - Auckland City Council newspaper, 23 November 2008, Page 1 As part of the upgrade, existing parts of the structure were renovated and restored to its 1916 state - amongst other things ensuring that the 17 different floor levels in the building were reduced to just 6. The redevelopment has to date received 17 architectural and 6 design-related awards,Auckland Art Gallery: \\"Media release 15 November 2012\\" including the World Architecture Festival's 2013 World Building of the Year.World Architecture Festival: \\"Auckland gallery is World Building of the Year\\" One of the sealed entrances to the Albert Park tunnels can be found behind the Art Gallery on Wellesley Street.

Life At that time, there were seven thousand Persian prisoners who were captured by the Romans and held in Amida. Filled with the compassion at the sight of these men perishing from hunger and misery, Acacius resolved to help them. He assembled his clergy and addressed them in this manner: > Our God, my brethren, needs neither dishes nor cups; for He neither eats nor > drinks, nor is in want of anything.

Hugo Hoever, S.O.Cist., Ph.D., New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., 1955 pp.145-146 When the ransomed captives returned home to Persia, they told their ruler of the great deeds performed by Acacius. His actions so impressed the Sassanid Emperor Bahram V that he is reported to have ordered an end to the persecution of the Christians. Persian Emperor Bahram V also desired to see Acacius face- to-face. Permission to do just that was given to Acacius by Emperor Theodosius II. Acacius' kindness and charity led to the termination of hostilities between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanid Empire, and Christianity was able to flourish for a while in the areas then controlled by the Sassanid Persians. Saint Acacius' feast day is celebrated on April 9 (Roman Martyrology).

It was held on 20 October and 21 October 1964. 21 teams, for a total of 85 athletes, from 21 nations competed, with 1 team of 4 not starting in the first round. The first round and the semifinals were held on 20 October with the final on 21 October. The traditionally strong American team was weakened by the injuries to Mel Pender and Trent Jackson. The defending champions United Team of Germany (with no returning members) failed to get out of the semi-finals. The final began with Andrzej Zielinski out fast, making up the stagger on American substitute Paul Drayton on his outside. The Poles exchanged smoothly and their 4th place runner from the finals Wieslaw Maniak held a foot advantage on (plus the stagger) on Gerry Ashworth. Inside of them, France and Jamaica were making strong showings. Claude Piquemal put France into the lead through the turn with Jamaica, USSR and Poland all ahead when substitute Richard Stebbins handed off to Bob Hayes 3 meters behind France's Jocelyn Delecour. But Hayes was running in another gear, tearing down the track, making up the gap halfway down the straightaway then pulling away to a clear American victory and new world record. 3 meters behind Hayes, Poland's Marian Dudziak was able to out lean Delecour for silver. The United States' Bob Hayes ran the final 100m of the relay in a record 8.60 seconds. This remains the fastest anchor leg of all time.

It tells the story of a family living under the power of the vicious Billy, who physically, emotionally, and sexually abuses his wife, Mary, and children; Susan and Janet. The stage play is adapted from the radio production of the same name. The stage version of the play was first performed at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, on 31 May 2000, starring Lizzy McInnery, Gina McKee, Tim Pigott-Smith, Linda Bassett, Dione Inman and Gary Whitaker.Review: Five Kinds of Silence, The British Theatre Guide The play won the 1996 UK Writers Guild's Best Original Play award and the 1997 Sony Award for Best Original Drama.Five Kinds of Silence by Shelagh Stephenson, ABC Radio National, 30 October 2011 Plot Major themes in the play are control and how the family is bonded by abuse. Throughout the play we learn from the three women that Billy had created a strange, warped world for them to be confined in from inside his damaged mind. The story of abuse that Billy's family endured unfolds from interviews with police officials and psychologists with Mary, Susan and Janet. Billy himself was abused when he was a child; Mary was abused by her father after the death of her mother. After so many years the two daughters shoot their father during an epileptic fit. The play is coordinated to bring out Billy's passively sinister presence, and although he is not physically there, he is present in their memories. His abuse to these women has been so horrific that they shoot him twice to make sure he is dead. The play also explores ideas of abuse being continued from childhood, how abused children may in the future abuse their own children and isolation from the outside world. This theory relates to John Bowlby's Continuity hypothesis theory. How the relationship an infant has with its parent or parents shapes future ideas about relationships and future behaviour towards relationships.

The origins of Correos dates back to 1716. The change of dynasty in Spain ended the tradition of giving to some relevant families the duty to take care of the postal services and, on July 8, 1716, King Philip V appointed Juan Tom√°s de Goyeneche as Chief Superintendent and General Administrator of the Postal Offices, making the postal service responsibility of the State. The company is 100% state owned, through the State Society for Industrial Participations (SEPI). With more than 53,000 employees and 5.4 billion pieces of mail sent each year, Correos is one of the largest postal services in the world. Based in Madrid, it has over 10,000 postal centres all over Spain. The Correos Group is currently integrated by Correos and its subsidiaries: Correos Express, the urgent postal service of the Group; Correos Nexea, a company that offers communication and document management services to other companies, and Correos Telecom, which manages the Group's telecommunication infrastructure. History Cybele Palace, former Correos headquarters and current seat of the City Council of Madrid. One of the great developments in postal history during the nineteenth century was the invention of the postage stamp for the payment of shipments. The first stamps were issued in the United Kingdom, but many countries began soon after. In Spain, the first stamps was implemented on 1 January 1850, with face values ranging from 6 quarters for simple letters to 10 real for heavier certificates and international items. All stamps featured an image of the monarch. The last step for the final reorganization of mail came in 1889 with the creation of the Body of Postal Workers, organized as a pyramid structure. Coinciding with the reforms of the mid-nineteenth century liberal governments launched the telegraph service. Following the French example, Spain had developed a line drawing of optical telegraphy between 1844 and 1855, for the exclusive use of the State. From that date, was developing the electrotelegr√°fica network that joined in 1863 and all provincial capitals with Madrid. At the end of the century the number of telegraph offices open to the public amounted to fifteen hundred. This new system revolutionized the world of communications, reducing the time the message took to arrive to a few minutes. Typical format of Correos pillar boxes, found all over Spain Progress throughout the nineteenth century was consolidated during the 20th century with new technologies, new transportation, new services and a strong vocation of public utility caused the widespread use of email. The advent of the automobile and the airplane subsequently changed structures and accelerated postal delivery of correspondence and in 1899 the first post-road driving in the province of Navarra opened, and seven years later the central government in Madrid had already vehicle 16 for transporting the mail. In 1919 was created by decree in Spain the airmail service, which a year later created the first Spanish Airmail lines joining Barcelona Alicante and M√°laga, Seville Larache, Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca Malaga Melilla. However, the railway remained the principal means of carrying letters and packages throughout the peninsula until 1993 when the train service gave way to transport by road of the model. In parallel, Correos has been modernized through an ongoing process to provide new services throughout the century to citizens, such as express mail (1905), the Postal Savings Bank, on delivery reimbursement and Parcel Post (1916), the Postal Express (1981).  European projects  As part of its R&D; initiatives, Correos is participating in several European projects, this includes: * Leveraging eID in the Private Sector (LEPS). Project developed through a Connecting Europe Facility grant (CEF Telecom) from September 2017 to November 2018. This project seeks to simplify the connection of private services with European public identification nodes (eIDAS nodes) * Lightweight Infrastructure for Global Heterogeneous Trust management in support of an open ecosystem of stakeholders and trust schemes (LIGHTest). Project developed through a grant Horizon 2020 (H2020) from September 2016 to September 2019. It aims to create a global infrastructure that facilitates the verification of trust in electronic transactions. Correos participates as an industrial partner, developing two pilots of its digital services that serve as proof of integration with the resulting infrastructure.

From 1993 to 1997, she served as a judge on Florida's Second District Court of Appeal. On July 1, 2008, Quince assumed the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Florida for two years, the first African- American woman to head any branch of Florida government. Biography Quince was raised by her father, Solomon Quince, a civilian employee of the United States Navy, in Chesapeake, Virginia. The second of five children, she had to attend segregated schools, but she excelled as a student. Quince attended Howard University as an undergraduate, and received her Juris Doctor from the Columbus School of Law at The Catholic University of America in 1975.

From 1980 to 1993, she worked in the Criminal Division of the Florida Attorney General's office, the last five years as bureau chief for death penalty appeals. Appointment Quince is the only Supreme Court Justice in Florida history to be appointed simultaneously by more than one Governor. Because her term began the exact moment that Governor-elect Jeb Bush assumed his office, in order to avoid potential future controversy over her appointment, Bush worked out a joint agreement with lame duck Governor Lawton Chiles whereby they both agreed upon and jointly announced Quince's appointment in December 1998. When Chiles died of a heart attack a few days later, the task of signing Quince's commission to office fell to Chiles' temporary successor, Governor Buddy MacKay. Thus, three Governors were involved in Quince's appointment. See also *List of female state supreme court justices References External links *Florida Supreme Court page on Peggy A.

Two were built in 1916 and the final two in 1919. They were of steeplecab design, with a single roof-mounted pantograph to access the Milwaukee's 3,000 V DC overhead line. Originally numbered 10050‚Äì10053, they were renumbered E80‚ÄìE83 in March 1939. The ES-2 was the Milwaukee Road's primary class of dedicated electric switchers. Electric switching on the Milwaukee Road was always limited to the Rocky Mountain Division, and to the middle and east end only, Avery being merely a power change, rather than a switching, location. Harlowton's switching demands eventually exceeded the capabilities of the ES-2, which was replaced in 1951 by a single GE Freight Motor (later reclassed ES-3) instead; thus from the 1950s to the 1970s the ES-2s were normally used only in the greater Butte area, in which the Deer Lodge shops were also located. The Coast Division eschewed electric switchers entirely, as its operating characteristics and economics were more favorable to otherwise underutilized steam (later diesel) switchers which also served the Milwaukee's non-electrified branches in the area. Despite their highly specialized niche on the Milwaukee Road, the ES-2s were well-liked by personnel. Engineers liked them due to their rapid throttle response, preferring them over diesels which were slower to transition and accelerate. Their simple nature made them easy to service, and the units seldom needed major attention. Few changes were made to them over the years, the most important of which was the addition of extra steel plates, which added weight and reduced wheelslip. In addition to the pantograph, the ES-2s were equipped with a wooden trolley pole which was spring-tensioned and manually-operated, in the same manner as on a trolley car, though it was never meant for use while in motion. Its sole purpose was to make stationary contact with the wire to charge an empty air compressor enough to raise the air-operated pantograph, usually when making a black start after dead storage or maintenance. For this reason, the pole was tipped with a metal plate rather than a shoe or trolley wheel. From 1951 to 1974, one ES-2 was the Deer Lodge switcher, while another unit served to switch the yard at Butte. One unit was held in reserve at Deer Lodge to substitute for either of the other two. The E83 became surplus and was scrapped in 1952. The other three continued in service until the end of electric operations on the Milwaukee Road on June 15, 1974. The E82 was also the last Milwaukee electric locomotive to operate on the final day, after the Little Joes were stored upon arrival at Deer Lodge. None survived into preservation.

It was originally ordered by the SNCF for use on the new LGV Est, which was put into service in 2007. \\"POS\\" stands for Paris-Ostfrankreich- S√ºddeutschland (German for \\"Paris, Eastern France, Southern Germany\\"). History View from the cockpit aboard a TGV POS at 320 km/h The TGV POS number 4415 parked at the station in Strasbourg in September 2010, on the Paris-Zurich line via Strasbourg and Mulhouse Each train is formed of eight existing TGV R√©seau single-deck carriages paired with new power cars, with a total power output of and a top speed of under 25 kV. The TGV R√©seau power cars thus freed have been matched to newer TGV Duplex carriages to create TGV R√©seau Duplex sets. This is because traffic on the LGV Est is expected to be less than on the heavily congested LGV Sud-Est. Like the TGV TMST, the TGV POS power cars have asynchronous motors and, in case of failure, isolation of an individual motor in a powered bogie is possible. By using IGBT power packs, the new power cars are capable of developing 75% of their full rated power under 15 kV German and Swiss electrifications, compared to 45% for existing TGV power cars. This allows POS trains to operate at the same speed as Intercity-Express trains in Germany. The TGV POS links France with Germany and Switzerland. In Switzerland, it travels from Basel to Zurich and on the line from Vallorbe to Lausanne coming from Paris. Each TGV POS trainset weighs and is numbered in the 4400 series. The livery is the same as that of TGV R√©seau sets (silver and blue). Pre-production set No 4401 had a prototype livery similar as the one used on the TGV Duplex sets but, in March 2007, the blue areas were stickered over with silver and was now in appearance the same as the other sets. Since 2013, all of the TGV POS trainsets operate under the TGV Lyria brand and livery (a joint-venture by SNCF and the Swiss Federal Railways) with services between France and Switzerland, replacing the nine SNCF TGV Sud-Est trainsets that were taken out of service. World rail speed record On 3 April 2007 a train using both power cars of the TGV POS trainset number 4402 set a new world speed record for travel on conventional rails. The train reached . As part of a series of increasingly faster runs that culminated in the official record attempt, it set an unofficial speed record of on 13 February 2007. The trainset comprised three specially modified Duplex cars, fitted with two powered bogies similar to the AGV prototype, marshalled between the TGV POS power cars. The record trainset, configured as Bo'Bo'+2'Bo'Bo'2'+Bo'Bo', had four more powered axles than trainset 325 during the 1990 speed record, and had a theoretical maximum power output of instead of the on a standard TGV. Over 600 sensors were fitted on various parts of both the engines and the cars. The train set ran with larger wheels, and the catenary voltage was increased to 31 kV from the standard 25 kV. The maximum speed was achieved near kilometer post 193 on the LGV Est between Meuse and Champagne-Ardenne TGV stations.

The film has elements of blaxploitation.Black Mama White Mama review at DVD Talk The movie also was released as Hot, Hard and Mean (U.K. theatrical title). The movie was reportedly inspired by the 1958 film The Defiant Ones in which Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis are shackled together similarly to Grier and Markov. Set in an unspecified Latin American country (referred to only as \\"the island\\"), the movie was shot in the Philippines for budgetary purposes. Plot Brought to a women's prison in a tropical country which resembles the movie's Philippines-set location, Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) and Karen Brent (Margaret Markov), a prostitute and a revolutionary, respectively, butt heads and cause enough trouble to warrant transfer to a maximum security prison. They are chained together during the transfer, much to their dismay, and an attack by Karen's rebel friends set them free, albeit still chained together. The movie chronicles the pair's struggle to escape the army, led by Captain Cruz (Eddie Garcia) who enlists the help of the cowboy gang led by Ruben (Sid Haig). The pair also has competing goals: Lee to recover the money that she extorted from her former pimp, Vic Cheng (Vic D√≠az), and escape by boat, and Karen to meet her gun connections on time so that they do not turn on her rebel friends. The pair finally bond, despite their initial hate for each other, until they are finally freed by the rebel leader Ernesto (Zaldy Zshornack). The movie culminates in a violent shootout with Cheng and Ruben's henchmen (who are rivals), Ernesto's guerrillas, and the army. Cast * Pam Grier as Lee Daniels * Margaret Markov as Karen Brent * Sid Haig as Ruben * Lynn Borden as Matron Densmore * Zaldy Zshornack as Ernesto * Laurie Burton as Warden Logan * Eddie Garcia as Captain Cruz * Alona Alegre as Juana * Dondo Fernanco as Rocco * Vic D√≠az as Vic Cheng * Wendy Green as Ronda * Lotis M. Key as Jeanette * Alfonso Carvajal as Galindo * Bruno Punzalah as truck driver * Ricardo Herrero as Luis * Jess Ramos as Alfredo * Carpi Asturias as Lupe * Andr√©s (Andy) Centenera (uncredited) as Leonardo Production The movie was made by Four Associates Ltd., the company of John Ashley and Eddie Romero. In December 1972, it was acquired by American International Pictures. The movie takes its inspiration from the story concept of shackling a black character and a white one together introduced by The Defiant Ones (1958). John Ashley says the movie was originally called Chains of Hate and he bought the treatment from Jonathan Demme for $500. The lead actresses also reprised roles they already knew well. Pam Grier, who plays Lee Daniels, had done several tropical prison films, including The Big Doll House (1971), its non-sequel follow-up The Big Bird Cage (1972), and Women in Cages (1971).Monaco, James, and James Pallot. The Encyclopedia of Film. New York: Perigee, 1991. Print. Margaret Markov, who plays Karen Brent, had appeared in The Hot Box (1972), which was also a Latin American prison film. All of these movie were shot in the Philippines in accordance with their low budgets.Koven, Mikel J. Blaxploitation Films. Harpenden: Kamera, 2010. Print. Pam Grier and Sid Haig also appear together in another tropical prison film The Big Doll House (1971) and Grier, Haig, Vic D√≠az, and Andr√©s Centenera appear together in its non-sequel follow-up The Big Bird Cage (1972), which were also both filmed in the Philippines. Grier and Margaret Markov also starred opposite each other in the 1974 movie The Arena (a.k.a. Naked Warriors).Parish, James Robert., and George H. Hill. Black Action Films: Plots, Critiques, Casts, and Credits for 235 Theatrical and Made-for-Television Releases. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 1989. Print. The movie was made at the same time as The Twilight People. Several Volkswagen Country Buggies are used in the movie; these were based on the VW Beetle chassis originally for the Australian market. The Country Buggy was produced locally in the Philippines as the Sakbayan, using VW power plants sourced from either Brazil or Mexico. Eddie Romero says that Sam Arkoff of AIP called him during the shoot, saying he was unhappy with the lack of coverage. Romero asked Arkoff to have a look at the dailies and see if there was any coverage that he thought was needed. He never heard from Arkoff again after that. Grier became seriously ill during the making of the movie. \\"It was a tropical disease you get from ingestion, either from food or from the virus going through your skin in water\\", she said. \\"We were in a lot of rivers, rice paddies, where there are leeches and bacteria. So it was just a matter of time before it went through a cut and into your brain ‚Äì and it could kill you.\\" She was in bed for a month with a temperature of 105 degrees. \\"I lost my hair, I couldn't see, I couldn't walk. I was dying. The doctor kind of froze me to kill the cell in my brain.\\" Lynn Borden says she, too, fell ill during filming as well.  Themes  = Feminism and sexuality = Black Mama White Mama, despite its exploitative nature, passes the Bechdel test and contains themes of female empowerment. Both of the movies' leads are strong women. Karen Brent is a guerrilla fighter and Lee Daniels masterminds a scheme to screw over the misogynistic pimp, Vic Cheng. Although Karen is the only female present in the guerrilla force, she is essential to their cause, as she is the only one that has the connections to the weapons dealers, and the only one that those dealers trust (Ernesto says \\"Her contacts would never turn them over to us.\\"). She also is seen firing a gun right alongside Ernesto, the guerrilla leader. James Robert Parish and George H. Hill state that Pam Grier is \\"an intriguing mixture of pugnacity and femininity, with a heavy dose of world-weary cynicism\\" despite, according to Bob McCann, the movie itself being \\"somewhat listless\\",McCann, Bob. Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2010. Print. and the strength of both women outshine most of the male characters. Yvonne Sims states that \\"it became evident very quickly that Grier's screen presence overshadowed the one-dimensional roles that focused on her physical attributes and the weak storylines in AIP [American International Pictures] productions.\\"Sims, Yvonne D. Women of Blaxploitation: How the Black Action Film Heroine Changed American Popular Culture. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2006. Print. Pam Grier's character Lee also escapes from her former pimp with $40,000 of his money, while the pimp and his henchmen are all killed. Not only that, but when the pair is sexually assaulted by Luis in his work shed midway through the movie, Lee stabs him to death. Cultural critic Nelson George notes, \\"Pam Grier was a cult figure who was even embraced by many feminists for her ball-breaking action movies. She remains one of the few women of any color in American film history who had vehicles developed for her that not only emphasized her physical beauty but also her ability to take retribution on men who challenged her.\\" Therefore, \\"Grier...brought a new character to the screen that was instrumental in reshaping gender roles, particularly those involving action-centered storylines.\\" (Simms) = Black Power = Black Mama White Mama also contains elements of Black Power, as it was released during the middle of the Black Power era. The revenge that Lee Daniels gets on her former pimp is nothing short of Black Power, and \\"1973 marked the first time that audiences saw African American women in non- servitude roles.\\" Lee also wears her hair in an Afro. As a \\"Killer Dame\\" (along with Tamara Dobson, Teresa Graves, Jean Bell, et al.), \\"It was a goodbye to the headscarves worn by Mammy and the wavy hair of the Exotic Other, and a refreshing and political greeting to the woman with a natural hairstyle modeled, according to [film scholar Cedric Robinson], from civil rights heroines such as Angela Davis.\\" Moreover, her very portrayal of an action heroine \\"represented the antithesis of the Mammy.\\" In the beginning of the movie, Lee resists the white matron of the prison's lesbian advances, even though she knows that her life in prison will be a lot easier if she engages with her. Karen, on the other hand, readily submits to the matron's advances so that she does not have to work in the field, placing a greater burden on the other prisoners. This greatly irks Lee, as she sees it as a selfish move. Though both women play strong roles, Lee is unique in that she never lets a single character walk over her. The movie may be symbolic in that Lee is mentioned first in the title and the credits. The ending also implies that her strength exceeded Karen's. In another scene, Black Power is alluded to by a surprising source, Karen. During a fight with Lee over which direction to go while shackled together, she exclaims, \\"We're trying to set this island free. Christ, you're black, you understand, don't you?\\" This line of thought is not pursued further, but the scriptwriters (one of which was none other than Jonathan Demme himself, who later won an Academy Award for directing The Silence of the Lambs), were clearly making the connection between revolutionary actions occurring in Latin America and the Black Power Movement in the United States. Demme and Joseph Vila could have been referring to a number of Latin American revolutions, including the Black Power Revolution in Trinidad in 1970. This particular connection would make a lot of sense, because at the time in Trinidad, guns were not \\"readily available\\",http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1594&context;=jiws and a major plot point of this movie is that the guerrillas need guns in order to succeed and Karen's American weapons contacts are deemed essential for their cause. Release One advertisement for the movie included the tagline \\"Chicks in chains...and nothing in common but the hunger of 1,000 nights without a man!\\"  Reception  =Box office= Ashley recalls being unhappy when AIP wanted to change the title to Black Mama White Mama. \\"[It was] really left field. I didn't care for it. As it turned out, that was the most successful theatrical movie I have ever done, in terms of hard dollars in my pocket.\\" =Critical= The movie, like many blaxploitation movies, was a B-movie produced on a low budget and received mixed reviews. \\"So bad it's good\\", said the Los Angeles Times. Variety magazine said that \\"Performances ranged from bad to mediocre.\\" Josiah Howard writes in Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference Guide that the movie was \\"a lively and well-done women's prison yarn\\", but that it \\"somehow never really hits its mark\\", largely because \\"the filmmakers do little to distance themselves from the tired trick...of having key characters shackled together for almost the entire length of the picture.\\" However, the pairing of Pam Grier and Margaret Markov was \\"a hit with audiences\\",Howard, Josiah. Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference Guide. Godalming, Surrey, England: FAB, 2008. Print. as they played off each other well. Variety praised Eddie Garcia, saying that he \\"rises above the material by studious underplaying\\". \\"That film wasn't half bad\\", reflected Romero years later. \\"There are scenes in there I wasn't ashamed of. But some of those \\"cult\\" films, Beyond Atlantis and The Bride of Blood Island ‚Äì the worst things I ever did. Ayy!!!!... Pam Grier was the gamest actor I ever worked with. She was willing to do anything- jump off a cliff, whatever. I'd be talking to a stuntwoman and Pam would say, 'Oh I can do that.' Ha! She was very good. And Margaret Markov was very good.\\"  Soundtrack  The soundtrack received praise.

It was founded in 1984 and specialized in hyperimmunes, contract manufacturing, biopharmaceuticals and biodefense. Cangene was 61% owned by Canadian pharmaceutical giant Apotex and was publicly listed on the TSX under the symbol CNJ. Business model Cangene's business model shifted several times during its existence. There is some consensus that the company came to rely on revenue from United States stockpiling and bioterrorism contracts and did not adequately prepare for the disappearance of this revenue. At one point, the company attempted a shift away from contract manufacturing to research & development, but abandoned this track after about two years and subsequently moved to marketing of ready-for-launch products developed by other companies. History Cangene was founded in 1984 and had an employee count of 650 in 2004. In 2009, the number of personnel in the Winnipeg facilities alone was 550, with another 100 in Cangene bioPharma, 35 in its sales force, and about 100 across its plasma collection facilities. By the end of 2011, the overall number of employees was about 700, but significant cuts in personnel were conducted early in 2012. Such cuts were a continuation of a set of personnel reductions which began in mid-2010. In 2010, Cangene obtained United States distribution rights for WinRho from Baxter, which had held them since 2005. This was in part to counter declining sales of the product under Baxter, but also as part of the corporate strategy, which called for development its own IVIG product. As both WinRho and the newly conceived product were dependent upon human plasma as source material, Cangene expanded their plasma collection facilities in 2010. Development of the new IVIG product was subsequently cancelled in 2012, representing a strategic turn away from R&D; toward marketing in an attempt to return to profitability. Decline in profitability had come in part due to decreased cash flow from a bioterrorism-related program of work with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. In 2012, the company obtained exclusive United States distribution rights for Episil. In 2013, the company purchased rights to development and commercialization of three drug candidates, recombinant blood clotting factors VIIa, VIII and IX, the latter of which is in clinical trials. In February 2014, the company was acquired by Emergent BioSolutions. =Corporate governance= As of 2010, Paul Brisebois served as the company's vice president for commercial development. At the time, the company was in the process of expanding its sales force and shifting focus from contract manufacturing to a \\"strategy to optimize our commercial assets.\\" In 2011, the company's \\"longtime CEO\\", John Langstaff of Winnipeg, resigned and leadership went to John Sedor of Philadelphia as president and CEO.

The contract manufacturing subdivision, Celegene bioPharma, maintains facilities in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The sales and marketing office was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Most of the company's senior leadership were also based in Philadelphia by the time the company was sold in early 2014. Products As a result of their biodefense focus, Cangene had three products included in the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile: Heptavalent botulism antitoxin, Vaccinia immune globulin, Anthrax immune globulin. 2012 revenue from the biodefense products amounted to . Cangene also had four approved commercial specialty products: WinRho, HepaGam B, VARIZIG, and episil. 2012 commercial product revenue was , while their contract manufacturing revenue was . Cangene bioPharma Cangene bioPharma is the Baltimore-based contract manufacturing division of Cangene. As of November 2010, Cangen bioPharma had 100 employees in two facilities, and 30 customers. From May 2008 to at least November 2010, Cangene bioPharma supplied assembled Fusilev product to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals under a supply agreement. The agreement was slated to end in May 2013.

Career  Savua spent 18 years in the Fijian army, which he joined on leaving high school in 1971. When he retired from military service in 1988, he had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. The following four years (1988‚Äì1992) were spent in the Fiji Diplomatic Corps, first as counsellor (political) to the Fiji Mission to the United Nations, and then (for six months) as consul general to Sydney, Australia. In 1992, Savua joined the Fiji Police Force as deputy commissioner, the second highest position in the force. A year later, he was promoted to the post of commissioner. He was to hold this top office until 2002.  Coup controversy  The Fiji coup of 2000, in which saw the fall of the government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, took place during Savua's tenure as Police Commissioner. In an interview with Fiji Television on 29 April 2001, his last media appearance before being incapacitated by a stroke, Mara accused Savua of having been a party to the planning of the coup. This allegation was later repeated on 22 October 2004 under parliamentary privilege by Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau, Mara's daughter, who condemned his appointment as an Ambassador while still under investigation for alleged coup-related offences. Savua was not charged with any crime, and while alive denied the allegations.

The school also has a linking leisure centre and arts theatre. GSHS has been awarded, and retained, an Artsmark Gold award, the highest award for the Arts. GSHS is partnered with South Peninsula High School in Cape Town, South Africa. In 2010, GSHS was classified as an Outstanding school by Ofsted.\\"Ofsted Report 2010\\", www.greatsankey.org. The school converted to academy status in January 2013. In October 2017, the school was reclassified by Ofsted as a Good school.  Extensions  A new purpose-built sixth-form college was opened on the school site in September 2011 by Alan Yates (former Headteacher) and Simon Moran (Managing Director of SJM Concerts). In December 2019, the new PE hall was opened by current headteacher John Shannon on the site of what used to be the neighbouring primary school, Barrow Hall Primary School, along with a diner in use for the Year 7‚Äôs that was completed in January of 2019. The new science block containing 11 laboratories that was built on the same construction site was opened in February 2020. The plans for taking the schools grounds were confirmed by previous headteacher, Paula Crawley, when Barrow Hall Primary School relocated to a close area.  Uniform  The uniform is a white shirt, black trousers or skirt, black blazer with school badge attached and correct tie, differing per house team. The compulsory P.E kit is a black polo shirt for all, a black and white rugby shirt for boys, and either black shorts or black tracksuit bottoms, and optional socks.

The school also operates a Young Apprentice scheme, where Year 10 students have the opportunity to Start a two-year course and earn an NVQ level 2 with the school. In a partnership with the RAC, the school has built an RAC automotive engineering skills centre. This allows students studying engineering and automotive engineering, access to Facilities that few other engineering colleges possess, whilst also providing facilities for other schools and businesses in the local community. The school has a VEX robotics team called BHCVEX as part of the Engineering department. The team first initiated in 2010 when the team also won their first trophy in a regional competition using the Standard VEX Protobot and Tumbler kit. In 2012 the team participated in the VEX robotics UK national competition and won the competition, qualifying them for the world finals in California, However due to insufficient funds the team could not attend.

House system The school implemented a house system in the academic year beginning September 2007 to ease the strain on the heads of years, who previously had been allocated one year of students and had to manage all these students throughout their 5 year attendance at Great Sankey High School. It was decided that each house would have two forms from each year, and there would be twelve forms for each year group. Each head of house would then only have to manage 10 forms instead of 12, and each would only have to manage two year 11 forms at one time, instead of a head of year looking after all year 11 forms. Learners gain House Points for attending extra-curricular activities and going above and beyond the call of duty in lessons. Members of each house can be identified by their ties, featuring their house colours. The new ties, which were designed by learners, are being implemented from September 2009. Students are issued with house coloured planners and attend \\"House Assemblies\\". Sports day and other interhouse competitions are regularly organised each term, and at the end of the year, the top achievers from each house win a trip to Blackpool Pleasure Beach.

Payne was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1962. Biography Donald Gordon Payne was born in Denmark Hill in South East London. His father, Francis Payne, was from New Zealand and had served with the ANZACs in World War I, and his mother was Evelyn Rodgers, who had served as a nurse in World War I. As a child he travelled with his parents to New Zealand and Australia. He went to school at Dulwich College Preparatory, and then to Charterhouse School. Payne enlisted in 1943 and served with the Fleet Air Arm as a pilot flying Fairey Swordfish during World War II, escorting convoys across the Atlantic and to Russia. After the war, he took Honours in History at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After graduating, he worked for publishing firms as an editor, in sales, and as a ghostwriter. In 1953, he had his first book published, Dorset Harbours under his own name. In 1947, he married Barbara Back, with whom he had four sons and one daughter. In 1958, his first novel, The Midnight Sea, was published under the pseudonym Ian Cameron. After the success of this novel, he took up writing full-time. For his next work, Payne borrowed the pseudonym James Vance Marshall from the name of the Australian outback traveller and writer James Vance Marshall (1887-1964), whose writings provided much of the source material for what would become his most famous work, the 1959 novel Walkabout. Walkabout was originally published as The Children. In 1971, Walkabout was made into an acclaimed movie by the director Nicolas Roeg, featuring the British actress Jenny Agutter and Australian Indigenous actor David Gulpilil. After the book's success, Payne, with the permission of the Marshall family, continued to use the pseudonym for a number of novels, including A River Ran Out of Eden (1962; filmed as The Golden Seal in 1983), and for several other stories set in Australia; A Walk to the Hills of the Dreamtime (1970), and Stories from the Billabong (2008), and How Turtle Got His Shell and Other Stories (aka More Stories from the Billabong) (2013). Payne mainly used the pseudonym Ian Cameron, under which he wrote many exploration and discovery nonfiction and fiction books. Among the nonfiction titles is Riders of the Storm (2002), an official history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The fiction titles include the old-time adventure novels The Lost Ones (1961), which was filmed by The Walt Disney Company as The Island at the Top of the World (1974), The Mountains at the Bottom of the World (1972) and The White Ship (1975). Under the pseudonym Donald Gordon, he wrote four novels. Payne also edited several Reader's Digest volumes, such as the Travels & Adventure series. Donald G. Payne was also a painter and keen gardener, and played tennis and lawn bowls. He lived in Surrey, England. He died on 22 August 2018 in Redhill, in East Surrey Hospital.

At the peak of this practice in 1913, there were 70,000 ponies underground in Britain. In later years, mechanical haulage was introduced on the main underground roads replacing pony hauls, and ponies tended to be confined to the shorter runs from coal face to main road (known in North East England as \\"putting\\") which were more difficult to mechanise. As of 1984, 55 ponies were still in use with the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. When Ellington closed for the first time in 1994, four pit ponies were brought out (no ponies were used there during the RJB era). Of the four, two went to the National Coal Mining Museum for England at Caphouse and two went to Newcastle Cat and Dog Shelter. The last surviving pony was Tony who died in 2011 aged 40 at the Newcastle Cat and Dog Shelter. Probably the last colliery horse to work underground in a British coal mine, \\"Robbie\\", was retired from Pant y Gasseg, near Pontypool, in May 1999.

The last pit ponies used in Australia, Wharrier and Mr Ed of the Collinsville Coal's No 2 Mine in Queensland, were finally retired in 1990 after many years‚Äô service. Breed and conformation Larger horses, such as varieties of Cleveland Bay, could be used on higher underground roadways, but on many duties small ponies no more than high were needed. Shetlands were a breed commonly used because of their small size, but Welsh, Russian, Devonshire (Dartmoor) and Cornish ponies also saw extensive use in England. In the interwar period, ponies were imported into Britain from the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the United States. Geldings and stallions only were used. Donkeys were also used in the late 19th century, and in the United States, large numbers of mules were used. Regardless of breed, typical mining ponies were low set, heavy bodied and heavy limbed with plenty of bone and substance, low-headed and sure-footed. Under the British Coal Mines Act of 1911, ponies had to be four years old and work ready (shod and vet checked) before going underground.. They could work until their twenties. Work Nineteenth-century illustration of a stable in a mine. In shaft mines, ponies were normally stabled underground and fed on a diet with a high proportion of chopped hay and maize, coming to the surface only during the colliery's annual holiday. In slope and drift mines, the stables were usually on the surface near the mine entrance. Typically, they would work an eight-hour shift each day, during which they might haul 30 tons of coal in tubs on the underground mine railway. One 1911 writer estimated that the average working life of coal mining mules was only 3 1/2 years, where 20-year working lives were common on the surface. Recollections differ on how well the ponies were cared for in earlier years.  In art  Sultan, on the site of Penallta Colliery Pit ponies are commemorated by a artwork, Sultan, created between 1996 and 1999 by Mike Petts, using 60,000 tons of coal shale waste, covered with living grass, in a country park on the site of the former Penallta Colliery, north of Caerphilly, Wales. the artwork was named by local people, after one of the last pit ponies from the area, which was still living at the time.

Life and career Caraway was born on a farm near Springhill in Stoddard County in southeastern Missouri, the youngest of three children. His father, Tolbert Caraway, was a country physician and Confederate veteran; his mother was Mary Ellen Caraway. When he was six months old, Tolbert Caraway was assassinated in a feud, and the family was left impoverished. Thaddeus worked as a farmhand from the age of seven, then later as a railroad section hand, a farm tenant, and as a sharecropper. He studied at night and attended the common schools as a boy. His wife, Hattie Wyatt Caraway, who would go on to be the first woman elected to a full term as a United States senator. In 1883, he moved with his parents to Clay County in northeastern Arkansas. In 1896, he graduated from Dickson College in Tennessee, and taught in country schools until 1899. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1900, having launched his practice in Osceloa in Mississippi County in eastern Arkansas. Later that year he moved to Lake City in Craighead County, Arkansas, and in 1901 he moved again, to Jonesboro, the county seat of Craighead County. Each time he continued his practice. In 1902, he married the former Hattie Wyatt, whom he had met at Dickson College. Together they had three children, Robert Easley, Forrest, and Paul Wyatt. From 1908 to 1912, Caraway served as the prosecuting attorney for the state's second judicial circuit. He was elected to Congress in 1912 from the Arkansas's 1st congressional district, taking office as a representative in 1913 and serving until 1921. Rather than seek renomination in 1920, he chose to run for the Senate as a Wilson Democrat, and won; he was reelected in 1926. That same year, he purchased Riversdale at Riverdale Park, Maryland. In Congress, Caraway was a progressive and a reformer. He was a vocal critic of the Harding administration and the Teapot Dome scandal and he chaired a worked for laws requiring disclosure of activities by lobbyists. He co-authored the McNary‚ÄìHaugen Farm Relief Bill which would have provided price supports for farm products, although it was vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge. He supported American entrance into the League of Nations, bonuses for World War I veterans, as well as the Eighteenth (Prohibition), Nineteenth (Women's Suffrage), and Twentieth (Lame Duck) amendments. On May 15, 1921 he introduced a bill to prohibit the enlistment of African-Americans in the US Army and US Navy. Furthermore, during the 66th Congress Caraway offered H.R. 8112, which proposed segregating public and private transportation in Washington D.C. During the same Congress, Caraway sponsored H.R. 8113, which directed the \\"Commissioners of the District of Columbia to set apart certain sections, streets, blocks, or parts of blocks of the District of Columbia in which shall reside members of the Negro race only, and other sections... in which members of the Negro race shall not reside...\\" He served until his death from a blood clot in his coronary artery. He died in Little Rock on November 6, 1931, and lay in state in the Arkansas State Capitol on November 8. He is buried in Jonesboro. His widow, Hattie Caraway, was appointed to fill his seat by Governor Harvey Parnell and was elected, with critical help from U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr., of Louisiana, to fill out his term, becoming the first woman elected to the Senate and only the second to ever serve as a senator.Magdalena E. Thorne. Women in Society: Achievements, Risk, And Challenge. Nova Science Publishers, 2004. ; p. 14 Literary connection Despite Caraway's admirable accomplishments, during his early days as a senator he also gained national prominence for being a \\"modest and self- contained\\" man; a politician with \\"the shortest sketch in [the] Congressional Directory.\\" And the headline of a story detailing this distinction was later found pasted in the personal scrapbooks kept by iconic American author F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose masterwork The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway, a protagonist whose surname was originally spelled \\"Caraway\\" in Fitzgerald's earliest draft of the Gatsby novel.

Geography The topography of Rancho Bernardo consists of canyons and rolling hills that have large bedrock outcroppings. The major floral biomes of Rancho Bernardo are chaparral, coastal sage scrub, Southern California grassland and freshwater marsh/riparian habitat. The community is a sprawling community with shopping centers, golf courses, and office parks typical of San Diego development located about north-northeast of downtown San Diego, immediately east of 4S Ranch, north of Carmel Mountain Ranch, northwest of the city of Poway, and south of the city of Escondido. History =Pre-Colonial= The pre-colonial history of this area is divided into an early (prior to circa 900 BCE) and a late period. During the late period, a village complex known as the Westwood Valley complex was located along an intermittent stream bed. The period of habitation is from around 850 CE to 1790 CE. The peoples believed to have occupied this site are the Kumeyaay (formerly known as Diegueno/Ipai), although there are strong traces of Luise√±o as well. This village was likely known to the Kumeyaay as Sinyau-Pichkara. The area the village occupied is now under the western section of Ranch Bernardo near Duenda and Poblado Roads. =Post-Colonial= Rancho Bernardo is located on the Rancho San Bernardo Mexican land grant made in 1842. In the 1960s, Rancho Bernardo was annexed by San Diego. The area was developed by AVCO Community Developers. On October 22, 2007, the Witch Creek Fire burned through Rancho Bernardo and several other populous areas of San Diego County, destroying hundreds of homes, and completely destroying several entire neighborhoods, particularly ones that firefighters had trouble accessing due to rugged terrain and rapidly advancing flames pushed by strong Santa Ana winds. The highly unpredictable flames pushed into the northeast section of Poway during the day, prompting evacuation of Palomar-Pomerado Hospital. The neighborhoods of the Trails, Montelena and Westwood were the main areas hit in Rancho Bernardo. Economy The Carmel Mountain Ranch/Rancho Bernardo submarket is the fifth largest office space submarket in San Diego County, with over 6 million square feet of office space.\\"San Diego submarkets Q1 2019\\", Avison Young It is part of an \\"I-15 edge city\\", edge city being a major center of employment outside a traditional downtown. =Tourism= There is an annual carnival-type street fair, RB Alive!, during the summer. Rancho Bernardo is also home to the oldest-operating winery in the region, the Bernardo Winery, established in 1889 and family-owned and operated since 1927. =Industry= Sony Electronics Rancho Bernardo Rancho Bernardo is home to Corporate Headquarters of Sony Electronics, Inc. and a major office of Sony Interactive Entertainment, LLC.

The SportsMap Radio Network supplies its network affiliates with a 24-hour schedule of sports programming, including call-in shows and sports updates. Over its history, through cross-branding agreements, the SportsMap Radio Network has gone by the names SB Nation Radio, Yahoo! Sports Radio, Sporting News Radio, and One-on-One Sports. History =SEN (1991‚Äì1993)= Originally, the network was called the Sports Entertainment Network and was headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Founded in 1991, it was the third all- sports radio network in the United States. The prior two networks were Enterprise Sports Network which existed briefly in the late '70s and early 1980s, and RTV Sports which operated out of Mashpee, Massachusetts (on Cape Cod) in 1987 and 1988 and was syndicated on 27 stations across the US. RTV's owner, Tom Star, abruptly shut it down and absconded with the assets and paychecks suddenly in the summer of 1988 without a word to the staff and talent. =One on One Sports (1993‚Äì2001)= In 1993, One on One Sports bought Sports Entertainment Network, moved it to Northbrook, Illinois, and renamed it. One on One Sports was founded in 1991 and delivered closed-circuit broadcasts to spectators attending sporting events such as golf tournaments and auto races, utilizing custom radio receivers. They audio coupled play-by- play commentary with special programming for the listeners at the event. One on One Sports had sports updates every 20 minutes, that it called \\"One On One Sports Flash\\". SEN/One on One Sports was the nation's first 24/7 sports radio network; beating out SportsFan Radio Network, Prime Sports Radio (based in Dallas), and ESPN Radio (which was mainly nights and weekends through the late 1990s). One on One Sports' program clock mirrored WFAN's with \\"One on One Sports Flash\\" updates at :00, :20, & :40, past the hour. During its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, major market affiliates for One on One Sports included KTCK, Dallas/Ft. Worth; KILT, Houston; KDUS, Phoenix; KJR, Seattle; WQAM, Miami; WNST, Baltimore. Hosts & Sports Flash anchors from the One on One Sports-era included: Art Mehring, Bruce Jacobs, Scott \\"Football\\" Franzke, Bob Kemp, Jay Mariotti, Peter Brown, Kevin Wheeler, Scott Wetzel, Andy Masur, Rick Ballou, Arnie \\"Stinkin' Genius\\" Spanier, plus Bob Berger and Bruce Murray hosting the 6-hour long weekend scoreboard shows from 1-7p.m. ET (Berger and Murray were also the main fill-ins for the weekday daytime shows). One on One eventually acquired several O&O; owned and operated radio stations including 620 WJWR (now WSNR) in New York City, 950 WIDB (now WNTD) in Chicago, 1540 KCTD (now KMPC) in Los Angeles, California and 1510 WNRB (now WMEX) in Boston, Massachusetts. Most of One on One's O&O; stations were low-rated, but they had high profile local hosts including Brian Kilmeade (now of FOX News) hosting on WJWR, Tony Bruno on KCTD, and Bill Simmons and Sean McDonough on WNRB , plus the flagship rights to the Boston Celtics on WNRB. =Sporting News Radio (2001‚Äì2011)= One On One Sports was bought by The Sporting News magazine in 2000, and thus the network was renamed Sporting News Radio in early 2001. The only real change SNR made since being renamed was in August 2005, when it received an updated program clock and music package. In 2006, SNR owner Paul Allen (best known as the co-founder of Microsoft) sold SNR and The Sporting News. The network and magazine went to American City Business Journals of Charlotte, North Carolina, while the three remaining stations (KMPC, WWZN, and WSNR) were then re-sold to other companies. In 2007, Sporting News Radio moved its network headquarters from Northbrook, Illinois to Santa Monica, California. In 2010, the network headquarters were relocated once again to Houston, Texas, with the defacto network flagship becoming 1560 KGOW. =Yahoo! Sports Radio (2011‚Äì2016)= On August 1, 2011, Sporting News Radio re-branded as Yahoo! Sports Radio as part of a marketing relationship with Yahoo!. The partnership included the co-development of content for the network, and access to resources and personalities from Yahoo! Sports and its college sports website Rivals.com. David Gow explained that with the partnership, GOW was \\"picking up one of the most recognizable brand names in the world. We're getting access to some of the best sports journalism in the country, and we get to link ourselves together in a way that will accelerate the growth of our digital business.\\" No financial details of the relationship were announced, and GOW remained the sole operator of the network. = SB Nation Radio (2016‚Äì2020) = SB Nation Radio, 2016 to 2020 On July 18, 2016, Gow announced a partnership with Vox Media-owned sports blog network SB Nation, with the network renamed SB Nation Radio on August 1, 2016. The network leverages SB Nation's existing personalities and local sites to co- develop content for on-air and digital platforms (such as podcasts). In November 10, 2017, VSporto, a sports podcasting network, reached an agreement with SB Nation to provide different podcasts to fill-in airtime for Saturday overnight/Sunday morning slot (12:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m. EST). In August 2019, SB Nation Radio launched a spin-off service, The BetR Network, in partnership with Vegas Stats & Information Network; the network initially combines programming from SB Nation Radio with programming from VSiN, but there were plans for additional programs specific to the network (with the first, The Lombardi Line with Michael Lombardi, airing on weekends). The network's launch stations were WBSS in Atlantic City and KBAD in Las Vegas. =SportsMap Radio Network= On July 27, 2020, Gow Media dropped the SB Nation brand in favor of its own SportsMap brand, as it felt the network no longer benefited from cross-branding and had lost operational control in the process.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/191101/sb-nation-radio-to-rebrand- as-sportsmap-radio-network/ Personalities Prominent personalities on SportsMap Radio Network as of 2020 include Scott Ferrall and Tony Bruno.

Early life and career The daughter of James Donlan, a character actor in Hollywood films of the 1930s, it is speculated by some that she had uncredited roles in films such as Pennies From Heaven (1936) and Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938), but this has not been confirmed. Her early credited roles include Frenchy, the maid in the horror film The Devil Bat (1940), with Bela Lugosi, and other small roles often as similar French-accented maid characters. She played Carole Landis' maid in Turnabout (also 1940) and one of Red Skelton's concubines in DuBarry Was a Lady (1942). Donlan was a success as Billie Dawn in a touring production of Born Yesterday by Garson Kanin. It was the start of bigger things for Donlan. Laurence Olivier flew to Boston to confirm the opinion of American reviewers and chose Donlan to star in his production of the play to be staged in London's West End. The production opened at the Garrick Theatre in January 1947 and was very well received. Donlan was initially denied a work permit to star in the lead in Peter Pan due to complaints from Equity, the actor's union, who felt that a British star should have the lead.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/dec/10/american-acting- permit Later life and career After her run in Peter Pan ended, Donlan remained in the United Kingdom and began accepting film work. After Traveller's Joy (1949), Donlan worked for the director Val Guest as the female lead in several films including Miss Pilgrim's Progress (1949) with Michael Rennie, The Body Said No! (1950), with Michael Rennie; Mister Drake's Duck (1951), with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Penny Princess (1952) in the title role co-starring with Dirk Bogarde. In 1950 British exhibitors voted her the most promising female newcomer. Donlan married Guest in 1954, after their previous marriages had been dissolved. In total, Donlan appeared in eight films directed by her husband. The remaining films are They Can't Hang Me (1955), Expresso Bongo (1959) with Laurence Harvey and Cliff Richard, Jigsaw (1962) with Jack Warner, 80,000 Suspects (1963) with Richard Johnson. A further stage success came in 1959 in Jack Popplewell's And Suddenly It's Spring opposite Margaret Lockwood. Other films she made, with other directors, include Tarzan and the Lost Safari (1957) and Seven Nights in Japan (1976), her last film role. Writing and last years Her autobiographical travelogue, Sand in my Mink (1955) is a humorous tale of holiday adventures taken across Europe with her husband. Donlan's autobiography, Shake the Stars Down was published in 1976 (known as Third Time Lucky in the U.S.), which concentrates on her childhood years growing up in the household of her actor father James Donlan in the Hollywood of the 1930s. It also charts her early career as a dancer and actress. Guest retired from directing in 1985 and the couple moved to the United States in the early 1990s, where they resided in Palm Springs until his death in 2006. In later years, Donlan lived in Belgravia, London.

Initially, he left a balance of power between high-level officials with whom he entrusted the four-year-old Crown Prince Yan, who later succeeded to the throne as Emperor Cheng. Empress Yu was honored as Empress Dowager Yu, and the officials encouraged her to become regent. Under this arrangement, Yu Liang became the most powerful official of the empire. He became apprehensive of the generals Su Jun, Zu Yue, and Tao Kan, each of whom suspected Yu of erasing their names from Sima Shao's will, which promoted and honored a large number of officials.

This led to the people losing confidence in him. =Deposition and death= In 327, Yu Liang further resolved on separating Su, then the governor of Liyang Commandery (Ê≠∑ÈôΩ, roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui) from his troops, and he promoted Su to minister of agriculture‚Äîa post that did not involve commanding troops. Su saw his intent and declared a rebellion, with Zu's assistance. Yu Liang initially thought that Su could be easily defeated, but instead Su quickly arrived at the capital early 328 and captured it. Yu Liang was forced to flee. Meanwhile, Su pillaged the capital, and it was said that even Empress Dowager Yu's servant girls became spoils for his troops. Further, it was said that Su himself \\"humiliated\\" Empress Dowager Yu ‚Äî although the method of humiliation was not specified in history. She died in distress and fear. Her son Emperor Cheng would become Su's captive for months before other provincial generals would converge on Jiankang and defeat Su.

Led by artistic directors Jackie Dempsey and Steve O'Hearn, Squonk Opera formed in 1992 and has created fourteen distinct shows and performed in over 250 venues in 35 of the United States. Squonk Opera has been touring internationally since 2003 - to Scotland, Belgium, Germany and twice to South Korea, where they opened both the Busan International Performing Arts Festival and the World Music Theater Festival. In 2017, Squonk was one of the first western acts to perform at the Qingdao International Beer Festival in Qingdao, China. Over 500,000 people have seen Squonk around the world, and reviews include ‚Äúa multimedia troupe of infinite jest with an imagination to match‚Äù from The New York Times, \\"insane majesty\\" from The Scotsman, and \\"...surreal and poetic\\" from USA Today. Squonk Opera's shows consist of music, visual art, and acting elements in an attempt to make a form of opera accessible to all people. Dempsey says \\"we like to think of ourselves as a wacky, provincial opera company.\\" They named the group \\"Squonk\\" after a description of a jazz saxophonist's playing as a \\"squonk-fest\\", rather than the legendary creature of the same name. In 2000, Squonk Opera took their show Bigsm√∂rg√•sb√∏rdw√ºnderwerk onto Broadway from its previous off-Broadway run. Though the venture wasn't a commercial success, the exposure it gained them was ultimately beneficial. In 2011, Squonk Opera performed on the popular television show America's Got Talent. They were sent directly past the Vegas round into Hollywood, and thus did not compete until the first quarterfinals. The group was eliminated, being buzzed by Sharon Osbourne and Piers Morgan. Squonk Opera has received over 100 grants and awards for their work, including eight NEA awards, an American Theater Wing Award, and grants from other national funders such as the Rockefeller M.A.P. Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Jim Henson Foundation, and Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. Additionally, Squonk Opera has been supported by numerous local and regional funders, including Heinz Endowments, The Pittsburgh Foundation, PNC Charitable Trust, Grable Foundation, Buhl Foundation, The Opportunity Fund, and many others.

Evans was the son of George Evans and Sarah White, and had a younger brother, Frederick William Evans, who became a Shaker and served as an elder in the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society. In 1844, Evans, the trade unionist John Windt, the former Chartist Thomas Devyr and others founded the National Reform Association, which lobbied Congress and sought political supporters with the slogan \\"Vote Yourself a Farm.\\" Between 1844 and 1862, Congress received petitions signed by 55,000 Americans calling for free public lands for homesteaders. Free land was depicted as a means of attracting the excessive eastern population westward, and, as a result, bringing about higher wages and better working conditions for the laboring man in the eastern industrial areas. For many years the public domain had been regarded as the safety valve of the American political and economic order. The efforts of Evans and his allies‚Äînotably Horace Greeley‚Äîled to the Homestead Act of 1862. Evans, thus, deserves the title of \\"Father of the Homestead Act.\\" Evans was a publisher, and the editor of a series of radical newspapers including: Workingman's Advocate (1829‚Äì36, 1844‚Äì45), New York Daily Sentinel (1830), The Man (1834), The Radical (1841‚Äì43), The People's Rights (1844), and Young America (1845‚Äì49). He also spent the period 1837‚Äì41, and the period after 1848, on his farm in New Jersey. George Henry Evans died in 1855.

The Society of the Friends of St George's and Descendants of the Knights of the Garter is a constituent group of the Foundation of the College of St George, Windsor Castle which is a national charity in England. The society includes more than 5,100 members worldwide (including more than 900 AmFriends members of the American Friends of St George's and Descendants of the Knights of the Garter Inc.) to \\"protect, preserve and enhance\\" the college, its St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle and the royal chivalric knighthood, the Order of the Garter. In addition to the many enhancement projects that the society helped fund since its creation, several major preservation projects were also completed. The ongoing project for 2009 is to clean and restore the chapel West Window which is one of the largest in any English church with its collection of late-medieval stained-glass. The project for 2007 was to clean and repair the chapel West Front including its 16th century stonework, turrets and flying buttresses. People interested in the society and its traditions and service may join as its members. History A group known as the Association of the Descendants of the Knights of the Garter was founded in the 1920s, composed of knights (KG) and ladies (LG) of the order, and their descendants. Another group known as the Friends of St George's was founded in 1931 to support the college by raising funds to \\"protect, preserve and enhance\\" the chapel as the physical and spiritual center of the order. The two groups accomplished their missions separately until 1934 when they merged as The Society of the Friends of St George's with which is amalgamated the Association of the Descendants of the Knights of the Garter. The society was founded with the mission to continue the support of the college and historic chapel. The society shares with the order its patron Saint George the Martyr, the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense (Shame be to him who thinks evil of it), and the insignia of the garter. The society changed its name a last time in 1966 when it was designated by the Charity Commission for England and Wales as a charity. After celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2006, the society became a constituent group of the foundation in 2007 when it completed its change in corporate governance. A separate Philadelphia-based group, the Society of Descendants of Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter , was founded in 1929 according to the group, the Hereditary Society Blue Book and the Hereditary Society Community of the United States of America . Officers The foundation enjoys the service of its patron, the sovereign of the order, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and that of its president, the statutory knight companion of the order, His Royal Highness Charles, the Prince of Wales. The foundation vice presidents are the members of the order. The foundation patron and officers are assisted in their duties by its Board of Trustees. The society members join in nominating a trustee to the foundation board, and are assisted in the society duties by its Friends' Consultative Committee. Membership All society members support its mission with their annual, ten-year or life contributions. Every member receives: *A copy of the society Annual Review which includes reports about the preservation work and history of the chapel and other college buildings, *Publication of his or her name in the Society's leather-bound Book of Honour that is displayed permanently at the chapel, *Entrance to the chapel and precincts through the Visitors' Centre during the open hours of the castle, *Invitation to attend the society Annual General Meeting and Festival in May, the society Friends' Stand spectator seating at the royal Garter Day procession and service in June, various society teas throughout the year, various society tours of the chapel and other places of historic interest, often with privileged access, throughout the year, and, chapel services, organ recitals, choir Evensong and other concerts throughout the year. =Friend members= Every friend member is also given a personalized written Membership Certificate which bears an illumination of the patron saint and dragon known as The George, and is signed by the Dean of Windsor; and a college heraldic badge which bears the heraldic shield of St George's Cross. =Descendant members= Descendant members have also proved descent from one or more of the current or former members of the order.

It is a popular vacation spot. The community's development played a role in the establishment of the California Coastal Commission. The population was 1,305 at the 2010 census. History The first people known to be at The Sea Ranch were Pomos, who gathered kelp and shellfish from the beaches. In 1846, Ernest Rufus received the Rancho German Mexican land grant which extended along the coastline from the Gualala River to Ocean Cove. The land was later divided. In the early 1900s, Walter P. Frick bought up the pieces to create Del Mar Ranch, which was leased out for raising sheep. In 1941, the land was sold to Margaret Ohlson and her family. Architect and planner Al Boeke envisioned a community that would preserve the area's natural beauty. Boeke first surveyed the land in 1962. In 1963, Oceanic California Inc., a division of Castle and Cooke Inc., purchased the land from the Ohlsons and assembled a design team. Principal designers who were recruited by Boeke included American architects Charles Moore, Joseph Esherick, William Turnbull, Jr., Donlyn Lyndon, Richard Whitaker and landscape architect Lawrence Halprin. Halprin created the master plan for Sea Ranch, which grew to encompass 10 miles of the Sonoma County coastline. The principal photographer for the project was the architectural photographer Morley Baer, a friend and colleague of both Turnbull and Halprin. Marion Conrad was hired to manage the public relations for The Sea Ranch. The logo for The Sea Ranch was designed by Barbara Stauffacher Solomon along with the Supergraphics. The project met opposition that led to notable changes in California law. While the County Board of Supervisors initially regarded the developer's offer to dedicate for public parkland as sufficient, opponents felt more coastal access was necessary. The site, containing 10 miles (16 km) of shore, had been available to the public but would be reserved for private use under the developer's plan. Areas below high tide were and would remain public property, but the plan provided no access through the development. In addition, California's coast at the time was only open to the public along 100 of its . Californians Organized to Acquire Access to State Tidelands (COAST) was formed in response to this issue, and their 1968 county ballot initiative attempted to require the development to include public trails to the tidelands. While the initiative did not pass, the California legislature's Dunlap Act did pass that year and required that new coastal development dedicate trails granting public access to the ocean. This episode led to the establishment of the Coastal Alliance, an organization of 100 groups similar to COAST, that placed Proposition 20 on the statewide 1972 ballot. The initiative passed, and it established the California Coastal Commission, which continues to regulate land use on the California coast. Geography and environment The Sea Ranch is located along the Pacific Coast, about north of San Francisco and west of Sacramento. The Sea Ranch is reached by way of State Route 1. About northwest of The Sea Ranch is Gualala, a small town which supports and is in turn supported by Sea Ranch. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 16.2 square miles (41.9 km), 99.74% of it land and 0.26% of it water. =Climate= According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Sea Ranch has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps. Demographics =2010= The 2010 United States Census reported that The Sea Ranch had a population of 1,305. The population density was 80.7 people per square mile (31.1/km). The racial makeup of The Sea Ranch was 1,220 (93.5%) White, 15 (1.1%) African American, 3 (0.2%) Native American, 10 (0.8%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 37 (2.8%) from other races, and 20 (1.5%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 117 persons (9.0%). The Census reported that 100% of the population lived in households. There were 689 households, out of which 58 (8.4%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 407 (59.1%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 19 (2.8%) had a female householder with no husband present, 9 (1.3%) had a male householder with no wife present.

Design Sea Ranch house designed by Joseph Esherick in 1966. The Sea Ranch Chapel, designed by James Hubbell. Sea Ranch is noted for its distinctive architecture, which consists of simple timber-frame structures clad in wooden siding or shingles. The building typology of the Sea Ranch draws on the local agricultural buildings for inspiration, in the way that those buildings are designed to deal with prevailing weather and topography. Originally, the Sea Ranch had local lumber mills to draw on for the Douglas Fir and Redwood used in the homes. The majority of the 1800 or so homes currently finished are smaller second homes, though there is also a small contingent of about 300 full-time residents. Approximately half the homes are rented as weekend rentals. The eventual build-out will consist of approximately 2400 homes; the number varies as some current owners purchase adjacent vacant lots and merge the two, to preserve open space. The buildings could be considered as a hybrid of modern and vernacular architecture, also known as the \\"Third Bay Tradition,\\" and also referred to as \\"Sea Ranch\\" style. The original design guidelines suggest that buildings have a site specific relationship with the landscape, although this is more difficult as the development approaches build out, and a lot of the newer homes are actually in-fill between already developed lots. The Sea Ranch specific design review requirements include various design guidelines so that the buildings become part of the landscape, not subordinate to it, but do not dominate either. Details such as exteriors of unpainted wood or muted stains, a lack of overhanging eaves, and baffles on exterior lighting subdue the appearance of the buildings in the landscape. Lighting is also baffled to minimize nighttime light pollution; there are no street lights, and the night sky is dazzling. The lack of roof overhangs is also intended to allow the near-constant strong breezes to pass over the buildings without the turbulence the overhangs would create. The Sea Ranch design review process has no impact on the interiors of the buildings, but all construction is subject to Sonoma County Permit and Resource Management oversight. Landscaping in The Sea Ranch is regulated by a design manual which prohibits perimeter fences and limits non-indigenous plants to screened courtyards. A herd of sheep is used to keep grass cut low to the ground to reduce the threat of fire during the summer months.

Concert pianist and recording artist  Peter Elyakim Taussig was born in Nazi- occupied Czechoslovakia, and grew up in Israel, where he studied with Czech pianist, Edith Kraus - a student of Artur Schnabel. After serving in the Israeli army during the Six-Day War, Taussig moved to Canada in 1968 and earned his master's degree at the University of Toronto, studying with Anton Kuerti. In 1973, Taussig began a long relationship with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, where among other things he became a friend and occasional collaborator with pianist Glenn Gould. Over the next decade, Taussig recorded over 200 chamber music broadcasts for the CBC - including the complete piano chamber music works of Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms. He gave frequent concerts, both as a soloist - with such conductors as Sir Andrew Davis, John Eliot Gardiner, the late Erich Kunzel and Arthur Fiedler, and with his innovative music ensemble, Camerata-Canada. In 1979, Taussig founded the Stratford Summer Music Festival in Ontario and became its first artistic director.  Video and performance artist  Starting in 1982, Taussig established a second career as a video and performance artist. He was member of the artist cooperatives Ed Video in Guelph and Charles Street Video in Toronto. His video opera ‚ÄúCatatonics‚Äù was featured at the video section of the Montreal International Film Festival and the Images Festival of Toronto in 1991. His performance piece ‚ÄúMy Memorial Service‚Äù at the Toronto Music Gallery in 1990 caused a stir as a rumor spread that he died. His best known performance work was the satirical piano recital ‚ÄúTaussig and Enemies‚Äù, with which he toured small town Canada for several years in the 1980s (excerpts on ).  Music technology  After moving to the United States, Taussig developed a technology tool at the Yamaha Corporation, Musical Sculpting. Using the company‚Äôs Disklavier-PRO computer-driven concert grand, the application allowed handicapped pianists to record with minimal use of their fingers. To demonstrate the potential inherent in this novel recording technique Taussig released two albums created entirely without the use of fingers, Bach's The Art of Fugue, (2001) and The Well-Tempered Clavier, book 1 (2002). In 2007 he collaborated with Dr. E. Paul Goldenberg of the Education Development Center (EDC) of Waltham, Massachusetts in the development of a math through music curriculum and they launched a pilot program at an elementary school in Ohio.  Author and composer Since 2009 Taussig has devoted himself exclusively to writing and composition. His first book, ‚ÄúThe Atheist‚Äôs Guide to Miracles‚Äù was published in summer 2012. Over the next seven years he has published four novels, two memoirs, two poetry and short story collections, and one translation from the German, his father's holocaust era memoir, \\"Man Without a Shadow, The Jew Who Would Not be Caught\\". The list of his compositions includes an opera (Fibonacci), a requiem Let There Be War, an oratorio (Eve of Life), three symphonies, and concertos for Bagpipe and Orchestra, steel pan, and Peruvian panpipes. His ballet ‚ÄúThree Dubious Memories‚Äù was choreographed by Paul Taylor in 2011 and toured extensively by the Paul Taylor Dance Company. His current CD projects include ‚Äú101 Sound-bite Symphonies - a celebration of short attention span‚Äù, and the electronic CD \\"Musica Sacra Nuova - Thirteen Urban Rituals\\" (2014). Personal life In 1998 Taussig suffered an injury to his right hand which ended his concert career. He was married to Canadian concert pianist Kathryn Taussig, n√©e Root (d. 2015) . He has one daughter, Elena Sachi Taussig, and lives in Colrain, Massachusetts with artist Linda Baker-Cimini.

It was set up through the Historic Places Act 1954 with a mission to \\"...promote the identification, protection, preservation and conservation of the historical and cultural heritage of New Zealand\\" and is an autonomous Crown entity. Its current enabling legislation is the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014. History Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe gifted the site where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed to the nation in 1932. The subsequent administration through the Waitangi Trust is sometimes seen as the beginning of formal heritage protection in New Zealand. Public discussion about heritage protection occurred in 1940 in conjunction with the centenary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The purchase of Pompallier House in 1943 by the government further raised the issue of how historic buildings should be cared for. Duncan Rae, the MP representing the electorate, suggested that a heritage organisation should be set up and put in a private member's bill. Whilst this did not proceed, the First National Government of New Zealand (of which he was a member) took responsibility of the issue and the Historic Places Act 1954 was passed, which established the National Historic Places Trust as a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The trust was governed by a 12-member board plus a chairman, and they first met in 1955. The National Historic Places Trust came under the responsibility of the Minister of Internal Affairs. The composition of the board was defined in the legislation and the board was appointed on the recommendation of the minister. The name of the organisation was changed to New Zealand Historic Places Trust in 1963. Early work undertaken by the trust included the recording of MƒÅori rock paintings, as some sites were to be submerged, e.g. through the Waipapa Dam and Benmore Dam. In 1961, the trust bought Te Waimate mission, the second- oldest building in New Zealand. In Akaroa, the trust enabled the Akaroa County Council via a significant grant to buy the Eteveneaux cottage, which serves as a link to Akaroa's French past. In 2004, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust became an autonomous crown entity. On 14 April 2014, the organisation's name changed to Heritage New Zealand. Later that year, the enabling legislation‚ÄîHeritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014‚Äîwas passed. There were changes in governance introduced by the new legislation, e.g. the branch committees were dispensed with. The legislation, which came into effect on 20 May 2014, also finished the transition from an NGO to a crown entity. Governance  It is governed by a board, appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage and currently chaired by Hon. Marian Hobbs, and a MƒÅori Heritage Council, currently chaired by Sir John Clarke. Past chairs include Dame Anne Salmond. The head office is in Antrim House, Wellington, while regional and area offices are in Kerikeri, Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Publication It publishes the quarterly magazine Heritage New Zealand. Listings Buildings owned by Heritage New Zealand include the Kerikeri Mission House, the Stone Store, and the Te Waimate Mission house. New Zealand Heritage List / RƒÅrangi K≈çrero The New Zealand Heritage List / RƒÅrangi K≈çrero (formerly known as the Register) is divided into five main areas: *Historic Places *Historic Areas *Wahi Tapu (MƒÅori sacred sites) *Wahi Tapu Areas * WƒÅhi T≈´puna - places important to MƒÅori for ancestral significance and associated cultural and traditional values The historic places are organised in two categories: *Category I ‚Äì \\"...places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\\" *Category II ‚Äì \\"...places of 'historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\\" , the register contains over 5,600 entries. The Canterbury earthquakes of September 2010 and February 2011 resulted in damage to a number of historic buildings in Christchurch. Post-earthquake redevelopment has caused a significant loss of heritage buildings in Christchurch. MƒÅori Heritage Council The MƒÅori Heritage Council (MHC) sits within Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga and was established by the Historic Places Act 1993. The functions of the Council include: *the protection and registration of wahi tapu and wahi tapu areas *assisting the Trust to develop and reflect a bicultural view in the exercise of its powers and functions *providing assistance to whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi in the preservation and management of their heritage resources *consideration of recommendations in relation to archaeological sites *advocacy of the interests of the Trust and Council so far as they relate to MƒÅori heritage at any public or MƒÅori forum.

Unlike most North American cyprinids, they feed on zooplankton, planktonic algae, and floating detritus, including rotifers, copepods, cladocerans, diatoms, and the like. Younger fish pick at food items individually, while adults work by pumping large amounts of water through the oral cavity; the food bits are caught in a patch of mucus on the roof of the mouth, where it is secreted by a special organ, and then the fish swallows mucus and food together. Blackfish are primarily denizens of the warm turbid waters found on the floor of the Central Valley, such as sloughs and oxbow lakes connected to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. They are also common in Clear Lake, Pajaro River, Salinas River, the small creeks that feed into San Francisco Bay. A population is present in the Russian River, although they may have been introduced. They also thrive in reservoirs, and have been spread to a number of California reservoirs via the California Aqueduct, and into Nevada via the Lahontan Reservoir (1964) where they have further colonized the Humboldt River drainage. Sacramento blackfish are of some commercial significance, and are sold live at many Asian fish markets in California. References * Peter B.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Westminster University. Conception to construction Westminster University was first conceptualized in 1890 by New Yorker Henry T. Mayham who convinced the Denver Presbytery to build a Presbyterian University on land that he owned on Crown Point, the highest point in what was then Arapaho County. https://www.cityofwestminster.us/Government/WestminsterHistory/ThePrincetonoftheWest Westminster Castle, 2008 Architect E.B. Gregory designed and laid the cornerstone for the university's main building, which was to be constructed of gray stone from the Coal Creek area. After delays in construction caused by lack of funds, Mayham hired New York architect Stanford White to finish the design and oversee construction. White changed a main design element, the stone, to a red sandstone from the Red Rocks/Manitou area. White's design was completed by 1893: 160 ft frontage, 80 ft depth, three stories tall, with a distinctive 175 ft tall tower. The building's architectural style is an excellent example of Richardsonian Romanesque. The Princeton of the West Although the construction was completed in 1893, the doors of Westminster University did not open until September 17, 1908 due to the Panic of 1893 and competition from a nearby Presbyterian college. Mayham's persistent fund- raising paid off when the first 60 students began classes in 1908. Tuition was $50 per year and included indoor plumbing. In 1911, the small farming community around the university, then known as Harris, voted to incorporate as a city. At that time, Harris decided to change its name to Westminster in honor of the university. The school continued in operation until 1917 when enrollment numbers dropped completely due to World War I. https://www.cityofwestminster.us/Government/WestminsterHistory/ThePrincetonoftheWest Pillar of Fire At its peak, the Crown Point property was worth nearly a half a million dollars. But after the devastating closure and three-year abandonment it was purchased by Bishop Alma Bridwell White of the White nationalist Pillar of Fire Church for $40,000 on January 31, 1920. Included in the sale was the main college building, of land, a power plant, and two houses (one a student's dormitory, the other the President's house.) The sale was a good deal, but the state of the buildings left the church with $75,000 worth of repairs. Shattered windows, cracked walls, and broken plaster were the main structural complaints, but the once regal building had also become a glorified barn with thousands of chickens in the basement and farm machinery on the first floor. In spite of the enormity of the work, the new Westminster University opened to students on September 7, 1920, just eight months after the purchase. Within six years of opening, the school, now known as Belleview Schools, had received its educational accreditation and was ready for decades of education. In the late 1920s the campus was frequently used for Ku Klux Klan meetings and cross burnings. But in 1997, the Pillar of Fire Church, the school's owner and parent organization, repudiated its historical association with the Klan. Today Belleview Christian Schools still reside on the Westminster University campus which is home to Belleview Christian Childcare & PreSchool (ages 1‚Äì4) and Belleview Christian School (K‚Äì12). Although most of the teaching happens in newer buildings on the campus, classes continue in the historic main building which was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The building is also the home of KPOF AM91 Radio, Colorado's first station to broadcast in HD Radio.

From 1999 to 2005 Knoop performed the public role of literary persona JT Leroy.  Early life  Knoop grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, born to artist and acupuncturist Sharon Hennessey, and documentary filmmaker and cinematographer, John Knoop. Knoop was the youngest of five half siblings. From 1999 to 2001, Knoop attended City College of San Francisco.  Portrayal of JT LeRoy  In 1999 writer Laura Albert, partner of Knoop's brother at the time, asked Knoop to play her fictional persona JT LeRoy. Knoop embodied JT LeRoy in all public appearances for the next six years. After the literary scandal was unveiled in the NY Times in 2005, Seven Stories Press published Knoop's memoir in 2007 titled Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy cataloguing their experiences of playing their sister in law's writing persona and avatar JT LeRoy. With director Justin Kelly, they adapted it into the feature-length film JT Leroy, starring Kristen Stewart, Laura Dern, Jim Sturgess, and Diane Kruger, released by Universal Pictures in April 2019.  Career  In 2001, Knoop founded the clothing line Tinc with Parachati Pattajotti, creative partner, architect and restaurateur. In 2006, Knoop's sister Hennessey Knoop joined as head of sales for their company. Tinc ran until 2009 and sold to stores such as Modern Appealing Clothing and Takashimaya. After folding Tinc, Knoop moved to New York. They finished their bachelor's degree in the fall of 2013 at CUNYBA under the mentorship of Vito Acconci. In 2014 they went on to their MFA at Virginia Commonwealth University: Sculpture + Extended Media. Movement is an essential part of Knoop's practice. Knoop has studied dance and martial arts for over twenty years. Knoop studies Brazilian jiu-jitsu under the tutelage of Marcelo Garcia in New York. Knoop, who identifies as gender non-conforming, has shown and performed at the Whitney, MoMA, the ICA Philadelphia, the Leslie-Lohman Museum, Movement Research, and Essex Flowers gallery.

Dithiolene ligands are unsaturated bidentate ligand wherein the two donor atoms are sulfur. Dithiolenes are often referred to as \\"metallodithiolenes\\" or \\"dithiolene complexes\\".Karlin, K. D.; Stiefel, E. I., Eds. ‚ÄúProgress in Inorganic Chemistry, Dithiolene Chemistry: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications‚Äù Wiley-Interscience: New York, 2003. Most molybdenum- and tungsten-containing proteins have dithiolene-like moieties at their active sites, which feature the so-called molybdopterin cofactor bound to the Mo or W. Metal dithiolenes have been studied since the 1960s when they were first popularized by Gerhard N. Schrauzer and Volker P. Mayweg, who prepared nickel bis(stilbenedithiolate) (Ni(S2C2Ph2)2) by the reaction of nickel sulfide and diphenylacetylene. The structural, spectroscopic, and electrochemical properties of many related complexes have been described. Structure and bonding Dithiolene complexes can be found where the metal centre is coordinated by one, two, or three dithiolene ligands. The tris(dithiolene) complexes were the first examples of trigonal prismatic geometry in coordination chemistry. One example is Mo(S2C2Ph2)3. Similar structures have been observed for several other metals. mnt)2, illustrating the intense color that typifies many dithiolene complexes. Because of the unusual redox and intense optical properties of dithiolenes, the electronic structure of dithiolene complexes has been the subject of intense study. Dithiolene ligands can exist in three oxidation states: the dianionic \\"ene-1,2-dithiolate\\", the neutral \\"1,2-dithioketone,\\" and a monoanionic radical intermediate between these two. When the latter two are complexed to a metal centre, the oxidation state of the ligand (and therefore the metal centre) cannot be easily defined. Such ligands are therefore referred to as non-innocent. The substituents on the backbone of the dithiolene ligand, R and R', affect the properties of the resulting metal complex in the expected way. Long chains confer solubility in less polar solvents. Electron acceptors (e.g. CN, CO2Me) stabilize reduced and anionic complexes. Derivatives are known where the substituents are the same, symmetrical dithiolenes (R = R') are more common than unsymmetrical. Due to their delocalized electronic structure, metal dithiolenes undergo reversible redox reaction. When oxidized, dithiolene complexes have greater 1,2-dithioketone character. In reduced complexes, the ligand assumes more ene-1,2-dithiolate character. These descriptions are evaluated by examination of differences in C-C and C-S bond distances. The true structure lies somewhere between these resonance structures. Reflecting the impossibility to provide an unequivocal description of the structure, McCleverty introduced the term 'dithiolene' to give a general name for the ligand that does not specify a particular oxidation state. This suggestion was generally accepted, and 'dithiolene' is now a universally accepted term. Only more recently the radical nature of monoanionic 1,2-dithiolene ligands has been pointed out. While few examples of authentic dithiolene radicals have been reported, diamagnetism in neutral bis(1,2-dithiolene) complexes of divalent transition metal ions should be considered as a consequence of a string antiferromagnetic coupling between the two radical ligands. :Limiting resonance structures of a R2C2S2M ring Applications and occurrence Dithiolenes occur widely in nature in the form of the molybdopterin-bound Mo and W-containing enzymes. Active site of the enzyme DMSO reductase features two pyranopterindithiolene ligands. Commercial applications of 1,2-dithiolene complexes are limited. A few dithiolene complexes have been commercialized as dyes in laser applications. Metal dithiolenes have been discussed in the context of conductivity, magnetism, and nonlinear optics. It was proposed to use metal dithiolene complexes that bind unsaturated hydrocarbons at the sulfur centers for industrial olefin (alkene) purifications. However, the complexities within such systems became later apparent, and it was argued that more research would be needed before using metal dithiolene complexes in alkene purifications may become practical. Preparation =From alkenedithiolates= Most dithiolene complexes are prepared by reaction of alkali metal salts of 1,2-alkenedithiolates with metal halides. A thiolate is the conjugate base of a thiol, so alkenedithiolate is, formally speaking, the conjugate base of an alkenedithiol. Common alkenedithiolates are 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate and maleonitriledithiolate (mnt2‚àí): : Ni2+ \\\\+ 2 (NC)2C2S22‚àí ‚Üí Ni[S2C2(CN)2]22‚àí Some alkenedithiolates are generated in situ, often by complex organic reactions: : cis-H2C2(SCH2Ph)2 \\\\+ 4 Na ‚Üí cis-H2C2(SNa)2 \\\\+ 2 NaCH2Ph Once generated, these anions are deployed as ligands: : NiCl2 \\\\+ 2 cis-H2C2(SNa)2 ‚Üí Na2[Ni(S2C2H2)2] + 2 NaCl Often the initially formed, electron-rich complex undergoes spontaneous air-oxidation: :[Ni(S2C2H2)2]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 1/2 O2 ‚Üí Ni(S2C2H2)2 \\\\+ H2O Structure of (C5H5)2Mo2(S2C2H2)2, featuring a bridging dithiolene ligand. It was prepared by the addition of acetylene to (C5H5)2Mo2S4. =From acyloins= An early and still powerful method for the synthesis of dithiolenes entails the reaction of Œ±-hydroxyketones, acyloins, with P4S10 followed by hydrolysis and treatment of the mixture with metal salts. This method is used to prepare Ni[S2C2Ar2]2 (Ar = aryl). =From dithietes= Although 1,2-dithiones are rare and thus not useful precursors, their valence isomer, the 1,2-dithietes are occasionally used. One of the more common dithiete is the distillable (CF3)2C2S2, prepared from the reaction of elemental sulfur and hexafluoro-2-butyne. This electrophilic reagent oxidatively adds to many low valent metals to give bis- and tris(dithiolene) complexes. : Mo(CO)6 \\\\+ 3 (CF3)2C2S2 ‚Üí [(CF3)2C2S2]3Mo + 6 CO : Ni(CO)4 \\\\+ 2 (CF3)2C2S2 ‚Üí [(CF3)2C2S2]2Ni + 4 CO =By reactions of metal sulfides with alkynes= Species of the type Ni[S2C2Ar2]2 were first prepared by reactions of nickel sulfides with diphenylacetylene. More modern versions of this method entail the reaction of electrophilic acetylenes such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate with well defined polysulfido complexes. History and nomenclature Early studies on dithiolene ligands, although not called by that name until the 1960s, focused on the quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolates and 3,4-toluenedithiolates, which form brightly colored precipitates with several metal centres. Such species were originally of interest in analytical chemistry. Dithiolenes lacking benzene backbones represented an important development of the area, especially maleonitriledithiolate (\\"mnt\\"), (NC)2C2S22‚àí, and ethylenedithiolene, H2C2S22‚àí.

It lies on the western slopes of Mount Osogovo at an altitude of above sea level. Having a mild and pleasant climate, it is located in the crater of an extinct volcano. It is known for its bridges and towers. History =Early Middle Ages= In the Roman period there was a settlement called Tranatura located within the modern city municipality. There was a mine nearby and the town was the seat of local authorities.A. –®–µ—Ä–∏—Ñ, –†—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –í–æ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞ –í–æ –í—Ä–µ–º–µ –ù–∞ –û—Å–º–∞–Ω–ª–∏—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –í–ª–∞–¥–µ–µ—ö–µ, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ 2001, 9 https://books.google.rs/books?id=3-VEs1_7NjMC&pg;=PA9&lpg;=PA9&dq;=kratovo+istorija&source;=bl&ots;=lZTDYNTa3b&sig;=tLlrEwrRnpMinceTJWiUv95G5S8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=9jb4VJ6sL8zkUeCqhJgO&ved;=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q;=kratovo%20istorija&f;=false, Epski gradovi, http://mirjanadetelic.com/leksikon/gradovi/gradout.php?ic=KRATOVO No remains of the settlement has been found, however, remnants of Roman fortification were found on Zdravƒçe kamen hill above the town. Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires ruled the area subsequently. =Late Middle Ages= In 1282 Kratovo became part of the Kingdom of Serbia.

The town was first mentioned under its current name in 1330. Gold, silver, lead, iron and copper were mined in the immediate vicinity and in wider surroundings of the town. During the reign of Emperor Stefan Du≈°an of Serbia the mines of Kratovo were the prime source of wealth of despot Jovan Oliver. After his death, during the fall of the Empire under Stefan Uro≈° V the town came into the hands of the Dejan family. Konstantin Dejan minted his silver coins here. The Ragusan merchant colony grew larger and took over the best part of trading . In 1389, during his attack on Prince Lazar, Ottoman sultan Murad I stopped in Kratovo to gather information and hold a war council. Next year, in 1390, his son, Bayezid, captured it from the Dejan and put his official (emin) to reside here. Kratovo was the seat of a nahiya, as a part of the sanjak of Kyustendil, as well as a kaza, seat of a kadi/judge, engulfing not only the town's vicinity but also ≈†tip, Koƒçani and Nagoriƒçani.Macedonia Under the Ottoman Empire, http://www.unet.com.mk/mian/oto.htm In the 15th century Kratovo was a very important mining town, inhabited by many wealthy and educated men, such as the writer Dimitar, or Marin, son of the priest Radonja, who in 1449 donated the whole sum needed for the fresco painting of the Prohor Pƒçinjski monastery. In 1484 Jovan Konik and Stefan, son of Branko, both from Kratovo, paid an amazing 16,424,000 ak√ße for a three-year rent of mints in Novo Brdo, Skopje and Serres.–°. –ö–∞—Ç–∏–∫, –ö–æ–≤–∞—á–Ω–∏—Ü–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –º–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏ –≤–æ –ö—Ä–∞—Ç–æ–≤–æ –∑–∞ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–≤–ª–∞–¥–µ–µ—ö–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ —Å—É–ª—Ç–∞–Ω–æ—Ç –°—É–ª–µ—ò–º–∞–Ω I –í–µ–ª–∏—á–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–∏–æ—Ç, –ì–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∏–∫ 54, 68 As a trade center Kratovo was also settled by Sephardic Jews.Macedonia the Ottoman Empire, http://www.unet.com.mk/mian/oto.htm Kratovo was an important stop for Ottoman sultans: in 1455, before an attack on Novo Brdo, the Ottoman army regrouped here. =Early modern period= In the 16th century Kratovo ranked among the most important mining towns in the European part of the Ottoman Empire. The mint was opened in Kratovo in the last decade of the 15th century and immediately it became the second largest producer of coins in the Ottoman Empire (just after Novo Brdo), making mostly silver akce, and later gold coins as well. However, from 1520 to 1540 minting and mining were in great crisis and many of the tenants, all of them local Christians, could not pay their leases and were imprisoned. Also, between 1519 and 1530 the number of Christian households dwindled from 982 to 606. After the reform and codification of the craft, the mining and minting recovered around mid- century. In 1550 C. Zeno noted in his travelogue that the Ottoman sultan gets 70,000 ducats from Kratovo. The official accounts of that year tell of benefits of 1,111,555 akce. However, due to the opening of new mints, this fell down to just 573,099 akce in 1573.–°. –ö–∞—Ç–∏–∫, –ö–æ–≤–∞—á–Ω–∏—Ü–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –º–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏ –≤–æ –ö—Ä–∞—Ç–æ–≤–æ, 73 The mines were managed by their renters who held the title of a duke (knez). Most of them were Christians. Amongst these wealthy men who were the first among all men in Kratovo we find Dimitrije Pepiƒá with his brothers or Andrija and Nikola Bojiƒçiƒá, who gave money for renovation of many churches around Macedonia (for instance Lesnovo Monastery). The inhabitants of Goldsmiths' and Minters' quarters, both Muslims and Christians, were businessmen who were famous for their investments in opening new mines such as Kuƒçajna, Majdanpek or Kremkovica, or for leasing mints in other centers, for instance in Novo Brdo. Such activity continued in early 17th century, but later in that century, around 1660 when Kratovo was visited by Evliya Celebi the mint has stopped its operation. The town was commanded by an ayan. Seven mines were active, yielding mostly silver and copper, but a lot of ore was brought from Osogovo and mountains around Kjustendil. Miners were locals who for their works in mines enjoyed certain freedoms and did not have to pay any taxes. Catholic bishop of Skopje Petar Bogdani reports in 1685 that Kratovo has 300 houses and 8 strong towers. At the time Kratovo was also famous for its copper products which were considered to be the best in the Ottoman Empire.–ö. –ù. –ö–æ—Å—Ç–∏—õ, –ù–∞—à–∏ –Ω–æ–≤–∏ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤–∏, 114-115 During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, under the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá, the bishops of Kjustendil often call themselves also ‚Äûof Kratovo‚Äú and some of them resided here as well since it was a more important and richer town than their seat. In 1689 town was taken by the advancing Habsburg forces. However, they soon retreated and Kratvo was burned down in retaliation. A lot of people left the town together with the Habsburg army; in early 18th century we find some of them living in Taban, the Serb suburb of Buda (today a part of Budapest). After this disaster most of the mining activity in the area was taken over by Zletovo and Probi≈°tip.–ö. –ù. –ö–æ—Å—Ç–∏—õ, –ù–∞—à–∏ –Ω–æ–≤–∏ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤–∏, 115 =Modern= Postcard of Kratovo, Macedonia from 1930's It seems that the mining recovered only in the first half of the 19th century. In 1829 a local aga managed the mines. However, mining was now done on a much smaller scale: Amu Bue in 1836 found only two furnaces working, both in bad condition, and some 5,000 ‚Äì 6,000 inhabitants. Later in that century the work was carried out by forced labor force recruited in villages from the region and many families have left the area because of it.Istorija Jugoslavije, Beograd 1972, p. 172 The mines were finally shut down in 1882. At the end of the century the town population dwarfed to 4,500, more than half Muslim Turks. In 1905 Kratovo had a Bulgarian lower grammar school and two primary schools while the Serbs had two primary schools.

The town was taken by the Serbian army on 9 November 1912. In following years the Turkish population left the town so that in 1931 the number of inhabitants was just 1,833. Culture Kratovo is known for its many reminders from the past. One of its symbols are its stone towers. Once there were twelve of them, but now there are only six towers remaining (Saat or Clock Tower, Simiƒá, Krstev, Eminbeg, Zlatkoviƒá and Had≈æi Kostov Tower). The towers were built in late Middle Ages, starting from late 14th century and were used not only for protection but also as storage rooms.T. Evans, Macedonia, 2012, p. 287 The Kratovo bridges are another characteristic of this town made by old masters. The town has unique and interesting architecture from the 19th century and a unique Art gallery of children's drawings, with pictures by Kratovo children which have won numerous prizes at different international exhibitions. Currently many organizations are working on rebuilding the city. One of the most valiant of these efforts comes from the University of Florida Engineering Without Borders program who are currently working on the development of a sustainable solid waste system to aid the efforts of North Macedonia in attaining recognition in the European Union. Language Situated in the north, the locals traditionally speak in the Kumanovo-Kratovo dialect of Macedonian language. Sports The most popular sports club from Kratovo is FK Sileks football club and they play their games at the Gradski stadion Kratovo. They have won the Macedonian league title three times in the late 1990s.

Albert was born and raised in Brooklyn. She has also used the names Emily Frasier and Speedie, and published other works as Laura Victoria and Gluttenberg. Albert was sued for fraud when she signed a film option contract with her pseudonym; a jury found against her. The damages to be paid to the film company were settled out of court. Writing and other activities During her youth, Albert was associated with punk rock and skinhead movements. She worked for several years as a phone sex operator, and reviewing sex sites and products on the Web. During the 1990s, she achieved some degree of fame as a freelance sexpert, under the alias \\"Laura Victoria\\". At the same time, she started writing stories - using the pen name \\"Terminator\\" - in the voice of a young boy telling about his difficult childhood and life in the streets. \\"Baby Doll\\", JT LeRoy's first published story, appeared under the byline \\"Terminator\\" in a September 1997 anthology. Albert published three books of fiction under the JT LeRoy pseudonym ‚Äì Sarah' (2000), The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (2001), and Harold's End (2004). According to The New Republic, Sarah was the second book Albert wrote but the first one published. The narrator is an adolescent among a group of lot lizards, teen male prostitutes at truck stops. Each wears a signature raccoon penis bone necklace. The narrator aspires to be like his mother, Sarah, to move higher in the ranks of prostitutes. The book is by JT LeRoy but LeRoy's character is never directly named. The nom de lizard is 'Cherry Vanilla' or, more regularly he is called Sarah, after his mother. The writing is evocative of a folksy magical realism, vivid, colorful phrases to describe the unconventional and gritty reality of a young boy. SF Weekly's literary critic described The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things as \\"essentially the prequel to Sarah.\\" \\"This novel is a collection of ten stories that describe a \\"chaotic, nomadic, and abuse-filled childhood.\\" In the opening story, \\"Disappearances,\\" a young boy named Jeremiah leaves a stable foster home to reunite with his biological mother, Sarah, an 18-year-old drug addict. The stories begin in Appalachia and follow the characters to California. Jeremiah's grandfather beats him while invoking judgmental Christian dogma. The abuse is the most consistent form of physical touch Jeremiah knows, and he comes to interpret it as a form of love. Albert wrote \\"Dreams of Levitation,\\" Sharif Hamza's short film for NOWNESS, and has also written for the acclaimed television series Deadwood. The film Radiance, which she also wrote, was made an official selection of the 2015 Bokeh South African International Fashion Film Festival. She collaborated with director and playwright Robert Wilson for the international exhibition of his VOOM video portraits, and with the catalog for his \\"Frontiers: Visions of the Frontier\\" at Institut Valenci√† d'Art Modern (IVAM). In 2012 she served on the juries of the first Brasilia International Film Festival and the Sapporo International Short Film Festival; she also attended Brazil's international book fair, Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura, where she and Alice Walker were the U.S. representatives. Brazil's Gera√ß√£o Editorial has re-released the JT LeRoy books in a box set under Laura Albert's name, and she and JT are the subjects of the hit Brazilian rock musical JT, Um Conto de Fadas Punk (\\"JT, A Punk Fairy Tale\\"). On March 11, 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Academy of Friends Oscar Party in San Francisco invited JT LeRoy ‚Äì played by gender-fluid fashion model Rain Dove ‚Äì to walk the runway as part of its HIV/AIDS fundraiser. In 2016, Laura Albert starred in a documentary about JT LeRoy that premiered at Sundance, titled Author: The JT LeRoy Story directed by Jeff Feuerzeig. Albert has taught at Dave Eggers' 826 Valencia and the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, and has lectured with artist Jasmin Lim at Artists' Television Access with SF Camerawork's Chuck Mobley, in conjunction with a window installation about her work. A spokeswoman for the successful \\"Heart for Eye\\" campaign to raise funds for eye surgery for children, Albert hosted a television segment and was both an interviewee and an interviewer of inspirational women such as Anastasia Barbieri and Anh Duong. She was photographed by Steven Klein for QVEST magazine and by Kai Regan for his \\"Reckless Endangerment\\" at ALIFE; she has also done fashion shoots for Christian Lacroix and John Galliano. Albert profiled Juergen Teller for the 2003 Citibank Photography Prize catalogue; and published her reminiscence of Lou Reed in The Forward. She was a catalog contributor for the \\"Blind Cut\\" exhibition at New York's Marlborough Chelsea and collaborated with Williamsburg band Japanther, releasing a limited-edition cassette under the name True Love in a Large Room, with original artwork by Winston Smith. She has also written for dot429, the world's largest LGBTA professional network, and been an invited speaker at their annual conferences in New York. Pseudonym As a teen, Albert called suicide hotlines for help. She felt more comfortable speaking with strangers as a boy because of the sexual abuse and degradation she'd suffered that seemed, in her world, relatively common as a female. She found counselors to be sympathetic when she called as a male. Calling a suicide hotline in the 1990s, she reached Terrence Owens, a psychologist with the McAuley Adolescent Psychiatric Program at St. Mary's Medical Center in San Francisco. Owens did not know her as Laura Albert at the time, but as Terminator. She explored this role in their conversations. Owens is credited with encouraging Terminator, who later became known as JT LeRoy, to write during their phone therapy sessions. Laura Albert explained the circumstances of JT's existence in a Fall 2006 Paris Review interview with Nathaniel Rich. She attested that she could not have written from raw emotion without the right to be presented to the world via JT LeRoy, whom she calls her \\"phantom limb.\\" \\"I had survived sexual and physical abuse and found a way to turn it into art,\\" she later wrote in The Forward. \\"Having struggled with issues of gender fluidity when there was no language for it, I created a character both on and off the page who modeled this as yet to be named state of being.\\" Albert went on to pursue literary conversations under the guise of JT Leroy, or as his friend Speedie. According to author Mary Gaitskill, at a dinner date in which she and LeRoy were to meet, instead, JT's friend, Speedie, sat down, and she and Gaitskill had a long conversation. \\"She struck me as very bright and very young,\\" recalled Gaitskill. Some accused Albert of intentionally manipulating people with a sympathetic persona such as LeRoy's in order to gain access and publication that she would not otherwise have been able to achieve as Laura Albert. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Whether the hoax was a performance-art lark or a cynical Ponzi scheme has been hotly debated. Those who defend the work argue that the stories -- no matter the source -- have touched people, furnishing their minds as literature does. And, they note, the books have always been labeled fiction.\\" Said Gaitskill in one interview, \\"It's occurred to me that the whole thing with Jeremy is a hoax, but I felt that even if it turned out to be a hoax, it's a very enjoyable one. And a hoax that exposes things about people, the confusion between love and art and publicity. A hoax that would be delightful and if people are made fools of, it would be okay‚Äîin fact, it would be useful.\\" What is not debated is that there was a demand for JT LeRoy to appear in public. San Francisco Chronicle commented that, \\"The permeable membrane between author and subject was tantalizing.\\" LeRoy was known to avoid the spotlight and refused to be labelled permanently male or female. His edgy work, as well as his elusiveness, drew attention from the media and developed a cult-like following, with praise from celebrities including Winona Ryder, Courtney Love, and Bono. The publisher and marketers capitalized on this fascination to provide further opportunities to expose the books. The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things was described in the Publisher's Comments as \\"The extraordinary stories that brought the author a cult following at the age of sixteen,\\" and \\"loosely edited autobiographical stories\\" for the persona of JT LeRoy. Instead of discarding her pseudonym and exposing herself in order to remind the public that LeRoy's story, though published as fiction, was not in fact, a memoir, Laura Albert chose her sister-in-law, Savannah Knoop, a 25-year-old aspiring clothes designer, to embody the pseudonym in public. In 2001, a person claiming to be LeRoy began appearing in public, usually decked out in wigs and sunglasses\\". Thereafter, the persona of JT LeRoy took on a public life of its own with a backstory that echoed the settings and events described in the books. Savannah Knoop as JT LeRoy, wore wigs and sunglasses, and was often accompanied by Laura Albert as her roommate, called Speedie/Emily Frasier, and Geoffrey Knoop, called Astor. A friend, Steve O'Connor, said that he knew Laura Albert had written the books. Star photographer Mary Ellen Mark claimed that when she photographed Savannah Knoop for a Vanity Fair shoot she was certain that Savannah Knoop was a woman and recalled the costumed JT LeRoy persona as \\"a masquerade that a lot of fancy people fell for...A put-on that didn't harm anybody.\\" However, Stephen Beachy published an article in 2005 to imply that Laura Albert wrote the stories, and later the New York Times confirmed that JT LeRoy was the invention of Speedie/Emily, whose real name is Laura Albert. Vanity Fair also publicly announced that Laura Albert wrote all of J.T.'s books, articles, and stories, corresponded as J.T. by e-mail, and spoke as him on the phone. Savannah Knoop stopped making public appearances as JT LeRoy. The media's attention shifted from a fascination with the persona of JT LeRoy and the writing, to a castigation of Laura Albert. Laura Albert did not publish writing as JT LeRoy again. Over the next decade, without the pseudonym, Albert gradually became more publicly expressive. Writing for The New York Times in 2016, Albert noted, \\"I meet a lot of young people and they're shocked that it was an issue to even have an avatar. Because they've grown up where you have multiple fully formed avatars.\\" Media discussion about Albert's creation of the JT LeRoy pseudonym and public persona continues to this day. \\"Looking back, Laura Albert anticipated just about all of it,\\" commented author Adam Langer. \\"Long before we had split our personas into the lives we truly live and the ones that we choose to create on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and everywhere else, Albert created her own avatar.\\" Film option and lawsuit Antidote International Films, Inc. and its president Jeffrey Levy-Hinte announced plans for a film adaptation of Sarah to be directed by Steven Shainberg.Feuer, Alan. \\"In Writer's Trial, a Conflict Over Roles of Art and Money\\". (June 22, 2007) The New York Times. Retrieved 2013-09-10. Albert signed a contract giving Antidote an option for the film rights to Sarah in the name of JT LeRoy. When Antidote discovered that JT LeRoy was a pseudonym of Albert, it sued Albert for fraud, alleging that the option contract was void. A jury found against Albert and ordered her to pay Antidote the $110,000 she had received for the contract, as well as $6,500 in punitive damages.Westfeldt, Amy. \\"Jury: novel bought by company fraudulent.\\" U.S.A. Today. Retrieved 2013-09-18. Albert was also ordered to pay $350,000 in legal fees to Antidote.Feuer, Alan. \\"Judge Orders Author to Pay Film Company $350,000 in Legal Fees\\". (August 1, 1007) The New York Times. Retrieved 2013-9-10.

She attended City College of New York and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Dorothy Uhnak, 76, Novelist Inspired by Police Experience, Is Dead Uhnak worked for 14 years as a detective for the New York City Transit Police Department. Uhnak's debut book, Policewoman (1964), was a non-fiction autobiographical account of her law enforcement career. After its publication, she left police work and devoted herself to writing full-time. Her first novel, The Bait (1968), received a 1969 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best First Novel (in a tie with E. Richard Johnson's Silver Street). The Bait was also made into a 1973 made-for-television film of the same title. It was followed by The Witness and The Ledger, which was adapted for the TV-movie and series Get Christie Love! starring Teresa Graves. All three novels featured Christie Opara, an NYPD detective assigned to the Manhattan District Attorney Office, where Uhnak herself was assigned for many years. After the Opara trilogy, Ms. Uhnak branched out into longer, more ambitious police novels such as Law and Order, which became a TV-movie starring Darren McGavin; The Investigation, which was adapted into a TV-movie featuring Telly Savalas as Kojak; and Victims, which seemed to fictionalize the Kitty Genovese murder. Several of her later novels were bestsellers. Uhnak died in Greenport, New York, reportedly of a deliberate drug overdose.

The state sent soldiers, supplies and money to the wars of the period but was not the location of any battles. Population Population growth was steady across the state, and especially grew rapidly after 1840s when the cities began building up. furthermore after the 1840s, a steady flow of immigration from Europe, especially Germany, Ireland and Britain, gave a more cosmopolitan aura to urban areas. Rural areas prospered by the nearby presence of two rapidly growing metropolitan centers in New York City and Philadelphia which purchased more and better foods as farmers modernized their techniques and made heavy use of railways.

Some remained in farming, but many others moved into textiles, construction, food industries and the professions.Robert Schoone-Jongen, \\"'There Was Work in the Valley'\\" Tijdschrift voor Sociale en Economische Geschiedenis 7.2 (2010): 56-81. online in English Religion John Fea has explored the links between agrarianism, republican politics, and Presbyterian moral thought in New Jersey in the 1790-1820 period. devout Presbyterians admired Jeffersonian democracy, especially Jefferson's emphasis on the virtuous farmer and their own devout belief that they were the chosen people of God. John Fea, \\"‚ÄòThe Chosen People of God‚Äô: Presbyterians and Jeffersonian Republicanism in the New Jersey countryside.\\" American Nineteenth Century History 2.3 (2001): 1-28. Princeton University, known as the College of New Jersey until 1896, was the intellectual center of the Presbyterian movement in the United States together with its neighboring Princeton Theological Seminary. The outstanding theologian was Charles Hodge (1797‚Äì1878) who spent his career at the Seminary and was the founder and editor for 45 years of the Biblical Repertory, later named the Princeton Review. he favored the Old School position, which was favorable toward ritual and hostile to revivalism. However he worked hard to prevent a schism in the church, as he held church unity to be more important than the particular factional beliefs. He also sought to hold the Presbyterian Church aloof from sectional strife regarding the expansion of slavery that led to the Civil War, though he insisted that the church must bear witness to Christian themes on political issues.Wallace Eugene March, \\"Charles Hodge On Schism And Civil Strife: Part I. Old-New School Schism.\\" Journal Of The Presbyterian Historical Society (1961) 39#2: 88-97 online. Constitution The second version of the New Jersey State Constitution was written in 1844. The constitution provided the right of suffrage only to white males, removing it from women and non-white men. The right of suffrage had previously been awarded to those groups underneath the Original New Jersey State Constitution of 1776. Some of the important components of the second State Constitution include the separation of the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new constitution also provided a bill of rights. Underneath the constitution, the people had the right to elect the governor. Industrial Revolution The economy of New Jersey was largely based on agriculture. However, crop failures and other agricultural problems plagued the settlers of New Jersey. Soil was becoming less fertile and worn out. However, New Jersey eventually funded an extensive effort that led to publication in the early 1850s of accurate agriculture-related surveys. Largely through the effort of George Hammell Cook, the publication of this survey helps to increase the state's involvement in agricultural research and direct support to farmers., retrieved January 14, 2006. As agriculture became a less reliable source of income for New Jerseyans, many began turning towards more industrialized methods. Many immigrants increased the population of New Jersey greatly. Most of them came from Germany, Wales, and Ireland. The Great Falls of the Passaic River Paterson, New Jersey, a city founded by the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures (SUM), was a leader in America's Industrial Revolution, harnessing energy from the high Great Falls of the Passaic River. The city became an important site for mills and other industries, including textiles, firearms, silk, and railroad locomotive manufacturing. As a result of its high silk production, it became nicknamed the \\"Silk City\\". In 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in the city. Thomas Edison, famous inventor, was born in 1847. He was called \\"the Wizard of Menlo Park\\" for his amazing inventions and improvements to other ideas. Over the course of his entire life, he was granted 1,093 patents.The Wizard of Menlo Park , retrieved December 16, 2005. He worked in Menlo Park. Of his most famous contributions included his design of the incandescent light bulb, the phonograph, the kinetoscope, the stock ticker, the telegraph, the Dictaphone, the radio, the tattoo gun, and the telephone. He started the Motion Picture Patents Company. One of his famous sayings was, \\"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration\\". =Transportation= The agricultural products from New Jersey usually were transported to larger markets in New York City and Philadelphia. In order to make such transporting of crops more profitable, newer transportation methods were devised. The first oceangoing steamboat went from Hoboken, New Jersey, around the southern tip of New Jersey, and ended in Philadelphia. Later, systems of canals were also built, the first of which is called the Morris Canal and ran from Jersey City, New Jersey, on the Hudson River, to Phillipsburg, New Jersey on the Delaware River. The Delaware and Raritan canal ran from New Brunswick, New Jersey on the Raritan River, and ends at Bordentown, New Jersey on the Delaware River. Locomotion was also improved. In the 1820s, Hoboken inventor John Stevens built a 10-ton locomotive in England and transported it to New Jersey. Since it was too heavy to run on regular wooden tracks, his son, also by the name of John, started constructing iron railroads. By 1833, the Camden & Amboy railroad had been completed, allowing a 7-hour passage between Philadelphia and New York City. Throughout the 1800s, over a dozen companies were operating railroad lines. By the end of the century the shores of the Hudson River were dominated by rail infrastructure including passenger terminals, ferries slips, and freight operations owned by several competing railroads. Second Party System: 1830s-1850s Historians have examined the emergence of the Second Party System at the state local levels. For example, Bruce Bendler argues that in New Jersey the same dramatic changes that were reshaping the rest of the country were especially pointed in that state in the 1820s. A new political system emerged by the end of the decade as voters polarized in support or opposition to Jackson. By the 1830s pro-Jackson Democrats and anti-Jackson Whigs had mobilize practically every adult male voter into their opposing coalitions thereby integrating politics at the local state and national levels Furthermore, the \\"Market Revolution\\" was well underway, as industrialization and upgraded transportation networks made the larger picture more important than the local economy, and entrepreneurs and politicians became leaders in speeding up the changes. for example William N. Jeffers of Salem County, New Jersey, build his political success on leadership with the Jacksonian forces at the local level, while at the same time building his fortune with a bank charter and building a steam mill.Bruce A. Bendler, \\"The Steam Mill and Jacksonian Politics: The Career of William N. Jeffers.\\" New Jersey Studies 4.2 (2018): 41-68. online Wars of the Nineteenth Century George B. McClellan Though no major battles were fought in New Jersey, soldiers and volunteers from New Jersey played an important part in the wars fought by the United States of America. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a battalion of volunteers from New Jersey, in four companies, was active from September 1847 to July 1848. Philip Kearny, an officer who led a cavalry unit, followed General Winfield Scott and fought in the Battle of Contreras and Battle of Churubusco. After the war, Kearny made his home in the state of New Jersey. George B. McClellan was an important general during the Civil War, and was elected governor of New Jersey in 1877, serving in office from 1878 to 1881. =Slavery and Civil War= The Quaker population of New Jersey was especially intolerant of slavery. However, New Jersey ended up becoming the last of the northern states to abolish slavery by enacting legislation which caused the slow abolishment of slavery. Though New Jersey passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, it wasn't until 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. However, by the close of the Civil War, about a dozen African-Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen. New Jersey at first refused to ratify the Constitutional Amendments that banned slavery. New Jersey was a major part of the extensive Underground Railroad system. No battles took place within New Jersey throughout the course of the Civil War. However, over 88,000 soldiers from New Jersey were part of several infantry and cavalry regiments. In total, 31 regiments were created by New Jersey soldiers during this war, along with four militia regiments, three cavalry regiments, and five batteries of light artillery. 23,116 of those soldiers served in the Army of the Potomac. Soldiers from New Jersey fought generally in the Eastern theater of the Civil WarNew Jersey in the Civil War , retrieved December 18, 2005. Over 6,000 soldiers from New Jersey lost their lives in the war. Philip Kearny, an officer from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, led a brigade of New Jersey regiments under Brigadier General William B. Franklin. Kearny distinguished himself as a brilliant officer during the Peninsula Campaign, and was promoted to the position of major general. New Jersey was one of the few states to vote for Stephen Douglas instead of Abraham Lincoln in the Presidential Election of 1860. The people of New Jersey also gave its electoral votes to George McClellan when he ran for President against Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1864, being the only free state that rejected Lincoln twice. McClellan later became the governor of New Jersey, from 1878 to 1881. Many cities like Paterson, New Jersey and Camden, New Jersey grew extremely strong through the duration of the Civil War. They produced many necessities, including clothing and war materials like ammunition. These cities prospered through constant production even after the end of the war. Cities like those of Paterson and Camden became crucial to the Northern war effort. With the Union's ability to manufacture more supplies, the Union was able to defeat the Confederates and successfully conclude the war and reunite the country.Stewart, Mark (2004).

He was selected by the Indianapolis Colts in the sixth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Michigan State. Rayner shares the NFL record for most teams played on with J. T. O'Sullivan, and Billy Cundiff; each has played for 11 teams. Rayner was also a member of the Green Bay Packers, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals, Washington Redskins, Dallas Cowboys, Oakland Raiders, and Buffalo Bills. Early years Rayner attended Oxford High School where he played as a kicker for the varsity football team. As a three-year starter he broke all but one school punting and placekicking record. He also played as a wide receiver, catching 13 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns. College career Rayner attended Michigan State University and graduated in 2004 with a major in kinesiology. He served as the football team's placekicker for four years and was a four-year letterman. He left Michigan State as the school's all-time leading scorer with 334 points. Professional career =Indianapolis Colts= Rayner was selected by the Indianapolis Colts in the sixth round (202nd overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft, and served as the kickoff specialist for the Colts. He was released by the Colts on April 3, 2006. =Green Bay Packers= Dave Rayner, as a member of the Packers, kicks off during a Monday Night Football game in 2006. Rayner was then signed by the Green Bay Packers on April 6, 2006. After Billy Cundiff was released, Rayner became the Packers' full-time kicker for the 2006 season. It has been noted that Rayner has one of the stronger legs amongst NFL placekickers. During the 2006 season, he kicked a 54-yard field goal against the Philadelphia Eagles, tying the longest field goal in Packers' history (Ryan Longwell and Chris Jacke also have made 54-yard field goals). He also made a 55-yard field goal two weeks later against the Miami Dolphins; however, it was called back due to a defensive penalty that occurred before the snap, nullifying the play. On September 1, 2007, the Packers released him in favor of highly touted rookie Mason Crosby. =Kansas City Chiefs= Nine days later, Rayner was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs to replace struggling rookie kicker Justin Medlock. After beginning the 2007 season with 13 field goals made in his first 16 attempts, he was released on November 26 after missing a fourth quarter attempt against rival Oakland. Rayner's inability to consistently make short field goals, with three misses from under 40 yards, was the primary reason for his departure from the Chiefs. He was replaced by veteran kicker John Carney. =San Diego Chargers= After being released from the Chiefs, Rayner signed a contract with the San Diego Chargers after full- time kicker Nate Kaeding was injured while making a tackle on a kickoff. With the Chargers, Rayner served as the kickoff specialist for the last two games of the regular season as well as the 2007-2008 playoffs. =Miami Dolphins= On March 11, 2008, Rayner was signed by the Miami Dolphins to compete with the incumbent, Jay Feely. However, Rayner was released on June 6, 2008, before training camp. Feely would be released in August 2008, as the Dolphins went with the undrafted rookie Dan Carpenter. =First stint with the Detroit Lions= Rayner was signed by the Detroit Lions on August 9, 2008 after the team waived punter Eddie Johnson to perform kicking duties during some pre- season games while kicker Jason Hanson was nursing an injury. He was once again released on August 26, 2008, as Hanson had recovered from his injury. He was 6 for 7 with the Lions during the pre-season. =First stint with the Cincinnati Bengals= Rayner was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals on October 11 while placekicker Shayne Graham nursed a groin injury. The team waived fullback Reagan Mauia to make room for Rayner. The Bengals released Rayner on October 21, as Graham had recovered from his groin injury. Rayner was 1-for-1 on field goals and 3-for-3 on extra points during his stint with Cincinnati. =Washington Redskins= Rayner was signed by the Washington Redskins on February 3, 2009, before the Redskins re-signed Shaun Suisham. Rayner was released on September 5, 2009 after signing an injury contract which prevented him from signing another contract in the 2009 season. =Second stint with the Bengals= Rayner was re-signed by the Cincinnati Bengals on February 13, 2010 when the Bengals did not re-sign Shayne Graham. Rayner was released on September 4, 2010 as the Bengals preferred Mike Nugent. =Second stint with the Lions= Rayner was signed on November 9, 2010 to fill in for the injured Jason Hanson. In a December 19, 2010 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Rayner kicked a game-tying field goal as time expired in the 4th quarter. He then kicked a game-winning field goal in sudden death overtime. He became the first Lions kicker to accomplish this feat. The win ended the Lions NFL-record 26 game road losing streak. On January 2, 2011 against the Minnesota Vikings, Rayner kicked a career-long 55-yard field goal. Only Jason Hanson had kicked a longer field goal as Lions kicker. On August 29, 2011, Rayner was released by the Lions. =Dallas Cowboys= On August 30, 2011, Rayner signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys, becoming one of four kickers in training camp along with Dan Bailey, David Buehler and Shayne Graham. On September 3, he was released after missing two field goals in the last game of preseason, as he was passed on the depth chart by the undrafted free agent Bailey. =Oakland Raiders= On October 22, 2011, Rayner was signed by the Oakland Raiders after their starting kicker Sebastian Janikowski suffered a hamstring injury. He didn't score as the Raiders were shut out by the Chiefs. He was waived on October 25. =Buffalo Bills= On November 8, 2011, Rayner was signed by the Buffalo Bills after their starting kicker Rian Lindell suffered a shoulder injury the previous Sunday against the New York Jets. In his second game as a Bill, Rayner made a 56-yard field goal. Rayner missed 2 first-quarter field goals early in the Bills Christmas Eve game versus Denver. Rayner himself would be injured in that game, forcing the Bills to place Rayner on injured reserve and hire yet another kicker (Brandon Coutu) for the final game. Following the season, Rayner was not retained; Buffalo re-signed Lindell and added John Potter to the roster for 2012.http://espn.go.com/blog/afcnorth/post/_/id/47910/steelers-busy-with- three-free-agent-visits References External links *Detroit Lions bio *Michigan State Spartans bio Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Oxford, Michigan Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:American football placekickers Category:Michigan State Spartans football players Category:Indianapolis Colts players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Miami Dolphins players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Cincinnati Bengals players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Oakland Raiders players Category:Buffalo Bills players ","title":"Dave Rayner"},{"id":"3661194","text":"State of Emergency 2 is the sequel to State of Emergency, developed by DC Studios.

In the 1960s, several race riots occurred following the start of urban decay. Through the 1970s, urbanization increased again, and these problems slowed.

Accessed 28 December 2007 World War I New Jersey was a site of shipbuilding throughout the World War I period. Refineries and ammunition factories were also built to supply war material. Factories such as the Singer Company based in Elizabeth converted from making sewing machines to making weapon parts. Several camps and the forts were opened for soldiers during the war. The roles of these sites were generally to provide a location for soldiers to stock up on supplies, receive medical treatment, or become discharged. Several Allied ships were sunken off of the coast of New Jersey. Other factors contributing to the U.S. Entry into the war include German sabotage of both Black Tom in Jersey City, and the Kingsland Explosion in what is now Lyndhurst. Camp Merritt was activated for use in World War I. It was from there that many soldiers headed for war in Europe were deployed to Hoboken in order to be shipped off to Europe. Camp Merritt was decommissioned in November 1919.Camp Merritt by Kevin Wright, retrieved December 19, 2005. Fort Dix, in Pemberton Township, was also constructed to help in the war effort starting in June 1917.Fort Dix, retrieved December 19, 2005. It was used as a training and staging ground throughout the war. After the end of the war, it was converted into a demobilization center. In addition to camps for training soldiers, factories were needed desperately to produce ammunition to help the war effort. Four companies that produced ammunition were created during the World War I period: Atlantic Loading Co., Bethlehem Loading Company, DuPont Engineering Company, and T. A. Gillespie Loading Company. Around 1919, after the end of World War I, these companies and plants slowed and ceased production of war materials. (The Gillespie plant was destroyed by explosions on October 4, 1918.) In addition, New Jersey became a leading chemical producer worldwide after discovering German secrets. Many chemical companies in New Jersey were able to exploit their advantage to become some of the largest chemical producers. Roaring Twenties People standing on the New Jersey-New York border in the newly constructed Holland Tunnel. Like much of the rest of the United States, New Jersey entered a prosperous state through the 1920s. Through this period, New Jersey's population and employment rate increased greatly. Though factory production decreased after the end of World War I, production lines still remained in relatively high production. Transportation became much easier through the 1920s. Cars became easily affordable and common. Roads were paved and improved greatly. As a result, many people who had never been farther than their hometown now could travel around the state. The Jersey shore became extremely popular through this period of time. The Benjamin Franklin Bridge was completed, linking Camden, New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1926. The Holland Tunnel, under the Hudson River, was completed in 1927 providing a means of easy transportation between New Jersey and New York City. Before, ferries were required to travel across the Hudson River. Later on, the George Washington Bridge (1931) and the Lincoln Tunnel (1937) were completed, making access to Manhattan even easier.Stewart, Mark (2004). New Jersey: History. Chicago: Heinemann Library. . pp. 30‚Äì32 New Jersey was also the first state in the United States to ratify Prohibition, which restricted the purchasing and selling of alcohol. However, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned alcohol manufacturing & sales, was later repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment in December 1933. Newark's breweries reopened almost immediately. Great Depression Like all the rest of the United States, New Jersey was hit hard by the Great Depression. By 1933, one-tenth of the population were dependent upon the Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In fact, New Jersey issued begging licenses to the poor and unemployed people because the New Jersey government funds were growing low and were being exhausted.Gerdes, Louise I. _The 1930s_ , Greenhaven Press, Inc., 2000. Under the Works Progress Administration, part of the Second New Deal by FDR, many new jobs were provided in order to support the poor and unemployed. These projects included the expansion of Fort Dix, Roosevelt Park in Edison, and Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway. In Jersey City political boss Frank Hague secured the construction the Medical Center, the Armory, and Roosevelt Stadium. Strikes also grew common during the Great Depression; in 1937 a group of gravediggers from New Jersey went on strike. In 1938 Orson Welles' produced his infamous The War of the Worlds radio broadcast from New Jersey. Listeners were told that a \\"huge, flaming object, believed to be a meteorite, fell on a farm in the neighborhood of Grover‚Äôs Mill, New Jersey, twenty-two miles from Trenton.\\" It went on to describe extraterrestrial monsters that destroyed massive stretches of lands in New Jersey as well as massacring many people. Although it was announced in advance and at conclusion as a radio play, the broadcast resulted in widespread panic into New Jersey and the surrounding areas.Gerdes pp. 210‚Äì218 Many people had believed the bulletin to be real, and that New Jersey truthfully was being torn up by giant and immensely powerful Martians. People fled the New Jersey area, while others worked hard to blockade their homes and ensure safety from the reported monsters. Listeners were relieved to discover at the end of the broadcast that it had been a fictional account. CBS was criticized for allowing fictitious bulletins to gain attention of listeners. Welles and the other broadcasters were not punished by law, but were held under a brief informal \\"house arrest\\" for a short period of time while being bombarded by questions by news reporters. During the Great Depression, 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., son of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, was abducted from his home near Hopewell, New Jersey. A long investigation ensued as detectives attempted to round up the kidnapper of the baby. The police proceeded to seal off many roads in order to prevent the kidnapper's escape, and interrogated the members of the Lindbergh household. The stress of being under police questioning led to the suicide of Violet Sharpe. Dr. John F. Condon became a negotiator between the kidnapper \\"John\\" and the Lindbergh family. The kidnapper demanded a ransom of $50,000, which was paid but turned out to be a hoax. Two other hoaxes were perpetrated by two other people who were not involved in the kidnapping, desperate to get their hands on ransom money. Both were charged after their declarations proved false. The baby was later found dead. However, federal experts and detectives slowly managed to locate and capture the kidnapper. James J. Finn was a lieutenant who tracked the ransom money. He had agents travel to banks to capture the kidnapper while passing the ransom bills. Meanwhile, Arthur Koehler, a federal expert, carefully examined the ladder used by the kidnapper. He traced the ladder to a company in McCormick, South Carolina. Finally, a ransom note was located and traced to Bruno Hauptmann; the bill had the license plate number of Hauptmann's blue Dodge Saloon that was written down by a gas attendant. He was tried in Flemington, New Jersey in what was known as the \\"Trial of the Century\\", and was convicted. Bruno Hauptmann was electrocuted in the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey.Gerdes pp. 230‚Äì240 As a result of the Lindbergh kidnapping the Federal Kidnapping Act, also known as the Lindbergh Law, was passed making kidnapping a federal law. The Agatha Christie mystery novel Murder on the Orient Express may have been based upon this kidnapping, with events paralleling many of the Lindbergh kidnapping.

While approaching a mooring mast in Lakehurst, the zeppelin suddenly caught fire, and within 34 seconds the entire hydrogen-filled zeppelin was engulfed in flames; 36 people died in the disaster, most of them leaping from the burning ship. Contrary to popular belief, the Hindenburg had flown an entire year of successful voyages before it caught on fire. Questions and controversy surround the accident to this day: theories for the sudden burst of flames include sabotage against the German Nazis, static buildup, and flammable fabric. The Hindenburg was not the first flaming shipwreck to encounter New Jersey during the 1930s, though. The SS Morro Castle caught fire during a nor'easter and beached herself near Asbury Park in 1934. 1940s and World War II New Jersey shipyards were responsible for the construction of many naval ships, including battleships, aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers and destroyers.

During the war, Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County was opened for naval production, which provided ships with a safe port to take on ammunition. A German U-boat (U-869) was sunk off the coast of New Jersey in 1945. Camp Kilmer was a staging area near New Brunswick serving the port of New York. Buildings were painted such that they had a camouflage effect. Camp Kilmer helped to serve troops by offering medical care and providing them with supplies. Camp Kilmer became inactive in 1949 but was reactivated for the Korean War. It again became inactive in 1955, but was reactivated for the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Fort Dix was opened again for the training of soldiers for the war effort. Nearly 500,000 soldiers enlisted for the war,Stewart pp. 30‚Äì37 leading many women to take jobs in their husbands‚Äô absences. Millville Airport opened on August 2, 1941.

Over 1,500 pilots were trained for advanced aircraft fighting at this airport.Millville Army Airfield, by JasperDyne Industries, retrieved December 26, 2005. Fort Hancock, New Jersey was also opened in Sandy Hook (New Jersey). Gunners in the fort prevented German submarines from entering New York Harbor. An internment camp housing people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent was located in Gloucester City, New Jersey. In addition, Seabrook Farms, New Jersey took advantage of Japanese labor to increase productivity when the government allowed small groups of people from the internment camps to work there. At the end of World War II, the government closed down the internment camps, but many people from the camps continued to work at Seabrook Farms.Seabrook Museum , retrieved December 26, 2005. In 1947 the current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was ratified, reorganizing the state government. Governors were allowed to serve four years instead of three, and a bicameral Legislature was created, consisting of a 40-member Senate and an 80-member Assembly. The new State Constitution also returned the right of suffrage to females and blacks. In 1947 the Trenton Six Case went to trial in Trenton, New Jersey. Six African American defendants were convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death for the murder of an elderly white shopkeeper based on coerced confessions. 1950s and 1960s In the 1950s, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey planned and built the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in the cities of Newark and Elizabeth. This was the first port in the world to containerize due to the innovation of Malcolm McLean and the founding of the Sea-Land Corporation. The newly opened port quickly made the docks of Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan and Hoboken obsolete. In 1985 the port was the busiest in the world. In the early 1950s, the cities of New Jersey began experiencing urban decay. Governments attempted to intervene with the urban decay, focusing on the office Gateway Center and several other projects. However, suburbs continued to grow. Revolts occurred, often due to frustration about the poor urban conditions. As urban decay started a gap between the wealthier suburbs and poorer cities, state income taxes were implemented to stop the gap. Around the 1970s, urbanization started increasing again. Glassboro During the 1960s, many African Americans felt disenfranchised. This feeling was exacerbated by police forces, which often sided against African Americans. This tension led to race riots, the first of which occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964, causing heavy damage to the Jersey City area. 71 stores were damaged and 46 people were injured. From August 11 to August 13, 1964, similar riots occurred in Paterson and Elizabeth. In the Paterson riot, twenty stores and other buildings were damaged, and eight people were injured. In the Elizabeth riot, six people were injured and seventeen stores were damaged. In the aftermath of these riots, 135 people were arrested.Overview of Paterson Riots (2004), retrieved January 9, 2006.The Crisis- an Overview, retrieved January 9, 2006.

No specific agreements were reached, especially in the area of restrictions on anti-ballistic missile systems. However, the meeting helped improve the strained relationships between the Soviet Union and the US. Also in the summer of 1967, urban residents, primarily African Americans, rioted for 5 days in Newark and the neighboring city of Plainfield. These two riots are known as the 1967 Newark riots and the 1967 Plainfield riots. The cause was the feeling that African Americans were being disenfranchised. 26 people died in the Newark riots, and nearly 1,600 were arrested. The riots are often cited as a major factor in the decline of Newark and its neighboring communities, as many residents fled to the suburbs following the riots. Race related violence would continue to plague the state with smaller riots occurring in Trenton in 1968, Camden in 1969, and Asbury Park in 1970. 1970s-1980s Because of its strategic location on the East Coast, New Jersey played an important role the United States' Cold War defense. 14 Nike anti-aircraft missile batteries in two groups were constructed in New Jersey to protect the metropolitan areas around Philadelphia and New York City. Also, a regional command center was built in New Jersey. By 1974, the missile sites became inactive. In addition to these, air defense radar sites, bases for interceptor aircraft, anti-aircraft gun batteries, surface-to-air missile sites, and command and control facilities were constructed to defend against an attack by long range, nuclear-armed aircraft of the Soviet Air Force.Donald E.

New York that most of Ellis Island came under the jurisdiction of New Jersey. New York State disputed this claim and retains jurisdiction of a small portion of the island. The dispute has little practical effect since the federal government administers the island through the National Park Service.

Owned by Rogers Communications, CIWW is one of several Rogers-owned stations with a news/talk/sports format, in this case branded as 1310 News. The station broadcasts with 50,000 watts from a transmitter site located at McKenna Casey Drive and Highway 416, with studios located at Thurston Drive and Conroy Road in Ottawa. CIWW is not a clear-channel station, but is the only station in Canada broadcasting on 1310 AM; it uses a daytime 2-tower directional antenna, and a nighttime 5-tower directional antenna. The nighttime signal is beamed mainly into Canada.http://radio- locator.com/info/CIWW-AM History The station was launched in 1922 by Dr. George Geldert, with the call sign CKCO. After changing frequencies a number of times (as most early AM radio stations in North America did), the station permanently adopted its current 1310 AM frequency in 1941. In 1945, CKCO became Ottawa's affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Dominion Network and remained so until the network dissolved in 1962. In 1949, the station was purchased by Southam, and changed its callsign to CKOY. The use of the CKCO call sign was in no way related to CKCO-TV in Kitchener, which signed on five years later. Logo as \\"Oldies 1310\\", c. 1992‚Äì2010 In 1972, FM sister station CKBY-FM was launched. In 1978, after two failed attempts to sell the stations to Moffat Communications, the CRTC approved their sale to Maclean- Hunter. The station adopted its current call sign (CIWW) in 1985, along with an Oldies format (at the time mostly music of the late 1950s to early 1970s.) The name used over the air was W1310, followed by Sunny 1310. In 1992 the station changed to the branding of Oldies 1310. In 1994 the stations became part of Rogers Radio when Rogers acquired Maclean-Hunter. First logo as 1310 News On October 12, 2010, the station announced it would be adopting an all- news radio format, to be branded 1310 News, taking effect the following Monday, October 18, at 6:00 a.m. CIWW is the fourth Rogers station to adopt a 24-hour all-news format after CFTR Toronto, CKWX Vancouver, and CFFR Calgary; the company also owns four other stations that combine the all-news format (during morning and afternoon drive) with talk programming. The final song played on the station in its oldies format, at 5:55 a.m. on October 18, 2010, was \\"Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)\\", a song which rapidly recounts radio from the 1950s, '60s & '70s. This was followed at 5:58 a.m. by an announcement that the format change was taking effect. This now officially leaves Ottawa as the largest Canadian market with no AM music stations. Rogers announced on November 5, 2013 that CIWW would begin carrying Sportsnet Radio programing from Toronto sister station CJCL for the bulk of its schedule. The station continues its all-news format during drive time hours; it also introduced a local late-morning general-interest talk show, Talk to the Hand, hosted by Ed Hand. The move was concurrent with layoffs at Rogers. On November 24, 2014, 1310 News made a slight change to their schedule, which included morning news beginning a half-hour earlier at 5:00am, Talk to the Hand was renamed to The Ed Hand Show and is now 3 hours instead of 2, from 10 ‚Äì 1pm.

The most recent version, Pfam 33.1, was released in May 2020 and contains 18,259 families. Uses The general purpose of the Pfam database is to provide a complete and accurate classification of protein families and domains. Originally, the rationale behind creating the database was to have a semi- automated method of curating information on known protein families to improve the efficiency of annotating genomes. The Pfam classification of protein families has been widely adopted by biologists because of its wide coverage of proteins and sensible naming conventions. It is used by experimental biologists researching specific proteins, by structural biologists to identify new targets for structure determination, by computational biologists to organise sequences and by evolutionary biologists tracing the origins of proteins. Early genome projects, such as human and fly used Pfam extensively for functional annotation of genomic data. The Pfam website allows users to submit protein or DNA sequences to search for matches to families in the database. If DNA is submitted, a six-frame translation is performed, then each frame is searched. Rather than performing a typical BLAST search, Pfam uses profile hidden Markov models, which give greater weight to matches at conserved sites, allowing better remote homology detection, making them more suitable for annotating genomes of organisms with no well-annotated close relatives. Pfam has also been used in the creation of other resources such as iPfam, which catalogs domain-domain interactions within and between proteins, based on information in structure databases and mapping of Pfam domains onto these structures.  Features  For each family in Pfam one can: * View a description of the family * Look at multiple alignments * View protein domain architectures * Examine species distribution * Follow links to other databases * View known protein structures Entries can be of several types: family, domain, repeat or motif. Family is the default class, which simply indicates that members are related. Domains are defined as an autonomous structural unit or reusable sequence unit that can be found in multiple protein contexts. Repeats are not usually stable in isolation, but rather are usually required to form tandem repeats in order to form a domain or extended structure. Motifs are usually shorter sequence units found outside of globular domains. The descriptions of Pfam families are managed by the general public using wikipedia (see History). As of release 29.0, 76.1% of protein sequences in UniprotKB matched to at least one Pfam domain. =Creation of new entries= New families come from a range of sources, primarily the PDB and analysis of complete proteomes to find genes with no Pfam hit. For each family, a representative subset of sequences are aligned into a high-quality seed alignment. Sequences for the seed alignment are taken primarily from pfamseq (a non-redundant database of reference proteomes) with some supplementation from UniprotKB. This seed alignment is then used to build a profile hidden Markov model using HMMER. This HMM is then searched against sequence databases, and all hits that reach a curated gathering threshold are classified as members of the protein family. The resulting collection of members is then aligned to the profile HMM to generate a full alignment. For each family, a manually curated gathering threshold is assigned that maximises the number of true matches to the family while excluding any false positive matches. False positives are estimated by observing overlaps between Pfam family hits that are not from the same clan. This threshold is used to assess whether a match to a family HMM should be included in the protein family. Upon each update of Pfam, gathering thresholds are reassessed to prevent overlaps between new and existing families. =Domains of unknown function= Domains of unknown function (DUFs) represent a growing fraction of the Pfam database. The families are so named because they have been found to be conserved across species, but perform an unknown role. Each newly added DUF is named in order of addition. Names of these entries are updated as their functions are identified. Normally when the function of at least one protein belonging to a DUF has been determined, the function of the entire DUF is updated and the family is renamed. Some named families are still domains of unknown function, that are named after a representative protein, e.g. YbbR. Numbers of DUFs are expected to continue increasing as conserved sequences of unknown function continue to be identified in sequence data. It is expected that DUFs will eventually outnumber families of known function. =Clans= Over time both sequence and residue coverage have increased, and as families have grown, more evolutionary relationships have been discovered, allowing the grouping of families into clans. Clans were first introduced to the Pfam database in 2005. They are groupings of related families that share a single evolutionary origin, as confirmed by structural, functional, sequence and HMM comparisons. As of release 29.0, approximately one third of protein families belonged to a clan. This portion has grown to around three-fourths by 2019 (version 32.0). To identify possible clan relationships, Pfam curators use the Simple Comparison Of Outputs Program (SCOOP) as well as information from the ECOD database. ECOD is a semi-automated hierarchical database of protein families with known structures, with families that map readily to Pfam entries and homology levels that usually map to Pfam clans. History Pfam was founded in 1995 by Erik Sonhammer, Sean Eddy and Richard Durbin as a collection of commonly occurring protein domains that could be used to annotate the protein coding genes of multicellular animals. One of its major aims at inception was to aid in the annotation of the C. elegans genome. The project was partly driven by the assertion in ‚ÄòOne thousand families for the molecular biologist‚Äô by Cyrus Chothia that there were around 1500 different families of proteins and that the majority of proteins fell into just 1000 of these. Counter to this assertion, the Pfam database currently contains 16,306 entries corresponding to unique protein domains and families. However, many of these families contain structural and functional similarities indicating a shared evolutionary origin (see Clans). A major point of difference between Pfam and other databases at the time of its inception was the use of two alignment types for entries: a smaller, manually checked seed alignment, as well as a full alignment built by aligning sequences to a profile hidden Markov model built from the seed alignment. This smaller seed alignment was easier to update as new releases of sequence databases came out, and thus represented a promising solution to the dilemma of how to keep the database up to date as genome sequencing became more efficient and more data needed to be processed over time. A further improvement to the speed at which the database could be updated came in version 24.0, with the introduction of HMMER3, which is ~100 times faster than HMMER2 and more sensitive. Because the entries in Pfam-A do not cover all known proteins, an automatically generated supplement was provided called Pfam-B. Pfam-B contained a large number of small families derived from clusters produced by an algorithm called ADDA. Although of lower quality, Pfam-B families could be useful when no Pfam-A families were found. Pfam-B was discontinued as of release 28.0. Pfam was originally hosted on three mirror sites around the world to preserve redundancy. However between 2012-2014, the Pfam resource was moved to EMBL-EBI, which allowed for hosting of the website from one domain (xfam.org), using duplicate independent data centres. This allowed for better centralisation of updates, and grouping with other Xfam projects such as Rfam, TreeFam, iPfam and others, whilst retaining critical resilience provided by hosting from multiple centres. Pfam has undergone a substantial reorganisation over the last two years to further reduce manual effort involved in curation and allow for more frequent updates. =Community curation= Curation of such a large database presented issues in terms of keeping up with the volume of new families and updated information that needed to be added. To speed up releases of the database, the developers started a number of initiatives to allow greater community involvement in managing the database. A critical step in improving the pace of updating and improving entries was to open up the functional annotation of Pfam domains to the wikipedia community in release 26.0. For entries that already had a wikipedia entry, this was linked into the Pfam page, and for those that did not, the community were invited to create one and inform the curators, in order for it to be linked in. It is anticipated that while community involvement will greatly improve the level of annotation of these families, some will remain insufficiently notable for inclusion in wikipedia, in which case they will retain their original Pfam description. Some wikipedia articles cover multiple families, such as the Zinc finger article. An automated procedure for generating articles based on InterPro and Pfam data has also been implemented, which populates a page with information and links to databases as well as available images, then once an article has been reviewed by a curator it is moved from the Sandbox to wikipedia proper. In order to guard against vandalism of articles, each wikipedia revision is reviewed by curators before it is displayed on the Pfam website. Almost all cases of vandalism have been corrected by the community before they reach curators, however. Pfam is run by an international consortium of three groups. In the earlier releases of Pfam, family entries could only be modified at the Cambridge, UK site, limiting the ability of consortium members to contribute to site curation. In release 26.0, developers moved to a new system that allowed registered users anywhere in the world to add or modify Pfam families.

The novel is set in the distant future as a group of space travellers, marooned in an inhospitable planetary system, attempt to terraform a moon and create a sufficient civilisation on it to refuel their ship so they can continue to their original destination. Plot introduction A couple of centuries from the present, artificial intelligences and nanotechnology are in widespread use in the Solar System and in some cases have caused disasters. Some people do not trust these technologies and plan a simpler life in a distant planetary system, where they plan to terraform a planet called Ymir. Once Ymir is habitable, they will abandon use of all advanced technology. Three sleeper ships leave the Solar System bound for Ymir, using suspended animation to keep the crew and settlers alive during the sub light-speed journey. While in transit, all communication with the Solar System ends; by implication, human civilisation has fallen. The lead ship, John Glenn, is crippled by a design flaw en route, and uses all its antimatter fuel to reach the nearest star system, Apollo. It warns the other two ships, which can correct the flaw, but there is no word from them about whether they reach Ymir. The John Glenn creates a substantial moon around the gas giant Harlequin by colliding several smaller moons together, and give it an atmosphere, seas, and the beginnings of an ecosystem. This takes 60,000 years, with almost all the passengers of the ship in hibernation during the entire time. The person in charge of creating and terraforming the new moon, Selene, is Gabriel. Apart from a brief prologue, the novel begins as the second generation of people born on Selene approach adulthood. Plot summary Gabriel is teaching a group of moon-born teenagers about agriculture. Rachel is one of these; she passes her exams and is selected by Gabriel to become a leader of the moon- born. Andrew is another; he fails his exams because he plays a practical joke on Rachel. Gabriel takes Rachel to the John Glenn. As the first moon-born to visit the ship, she arouses hostility from some of the leaders there. She learns that there are three classes amongst the space travelers: five are High Council, who rule until Ymir is reached; some dozens are Council, including Gabriel, and have extended privileges; and the remaining \\"Earth-born\\" are colonists, many of them not having been unfrozen since leaving Earth and with few rights. She also learns to use the vast repository of knowledge in the ship's library, and makes contact with the AI \\"Astronaut\\" who is kept severely restricted because the High Council doesn't trust high technology. Rachel comes to realise that when the moon-born have helped restock the ship with antimatter the John Glenn will continue on to Ymir without them, leaving them on a moon that can only sustain life for a century or two. Gabriel decides there is no immediate need for him and Rachel to return to Selene, and that as a leader Rachel would be most useful with the longer lifespan that is conferred by the suspended animation process, and has himself and Rachel frozen for a year. Problems with radiation flares intervene, and without Gabriel to stand up for her, they are left frozen for twenty years. Rachel returns to Selene to find her best friend killed in an accident, her boyfriend married and with children almost her own age, and her remaining friends more than twice as old as she is. She also realizes that the moon-born are being treated as slaves, with Earth-born as overseers. The moon-born must develop the technological infrastructure to refine antimatter, but there are major risks involved in the refining which could destroy the population of Selene. Rachel becomes a teacher of the next generation of moon-born. She teaches them what she is supposed to, but she also includes concepts from Earth history that she learns from the library and Astronaut - concepts such as democracy and passive resistance. She has a few friends among Council, and Astronaut is able to conceal her communications with them from other Council and High Council. Andrew (a childhood enemy) plays a more active role in stirring up rebellion, but the moon-born have no power to change their role. The Council notices the passive resistance and their members begin carrying weapons. Some years later, one of the ship's boats crash lands on Selene and is abandoned there. It has sufficient electronics to house an AI, and Rachel's Council friends make a copy of Astronaut there, Vassal, unknown to High Council. Ten years after Rachel was unfrozen, an accident leads to a Council member shooting one of the moon-born. Andrew leads a revolt and takes a Council member hostage. The rebellion is halted by a flare which requires everyone to shelter together, and by Rachel's heroic intervention. In the wake of the rebellion, a new understanding is reached between the moon-born and the High Council. They will work more as equals, and the refinement of the antimatter will take place at a safe distance from Selene. The travellers will leave more technology behind when they leave (including the copy of Astronaut) so Selene can survive. This is at a cost of delaying their departure significantly. Gabriel decides he will remain on Selene when John Glenn departs. A final, short, section of the novel sums up the next two hundred years, with the antimatter refined, the flare problem on Selene permanently dealt with, and John Glenn preparing for departure. Periods of suspended animation keep Rachel and Gabriel young. There is room for a sequel, dealing with either or both of the futures of John Glenn and Ymir, and of Selene.

Lake The lake is approximately , and is impounded by an earthen dam. The dam contains a bell-mouth service spillway which exits via an overflow tower on the dry side of the dam. There is also an uncontrolled auxiliary spillway that only functions during high water periods. The lake is maintained primarily for sportfishing. Fishing Primary gamefish include largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill. The property owners' association fertilizes the lake each year to promote gamefish growth. The water level of the lake is intentionally lowered during the winter months to reduce excessive shoreline vegetation growth. Because the lake is private, only owners, their families, and invited guests are allowed to fish. Gasoline powered motors are not allowed, and electric trolling motors are sufficient for navigation. Because of the ban on gasoline engines, water skiing and jet skiing are not allowed. The large number of obstructions such as stumps also prevent these activities. Hunting and the use of firearms are prohibited on and around the lake by the by-laws of the Hickory Hills Property Owners Association (HHPOA). Hickory Hills subdivision The subdivision of Hickory Hills is a gated community entirely surrounding Hickory Hills Lake. The entrance to the community is located on Richburg Road in Lamar County near the intersection of Richburg Road and Old U.S. 11. Access is provided via keypad and remote controlled gates. Most lots in the subdivision have some sort of housing. Types of housing range from small cabins to larger homes. Hickory Hills Loop is the circular road around the perimeter of the subdivision. It is a gravel road which is periodically graded, and is easily passable by all types of vehicles year round. Utilities In 2000, the HHPOA replaced the aging water system that delivered tap water to properties around the lake. The old system ran under the lake and frequently required repairs. The new water system was installed at a cost of approximately $100,000, and runs around the outside perimeter of Hickory Hills Loop. Following installation, Lamar County took control over the new water system. In the late 1990s, BellSouth replaced parts of the telephone wiring in Hickory Hills. Portions of the aerial cabling, including the stretch running across the dam, had deteriorated and become unreliable. Telephone outages were common following rain storms. The dam portion was replaced with temporary overground wiring, and eventually with a new aerial span. Due to Hurricane Katrina damage, BellSouth replaced most of the aerial cabling in 2005. Cable television is unavailable at Hickory Hills. Some residents have reported being able to get high speed Internet service via telephone lines. A cabin at Hickory Hills Lake on a snowy December in 1994 Access Access to the subdivision and lake is controlled via gates, and not available to the general public. Property owners association The Hickory Hills Property Owners Association (HHPOA) is responsible for management of the lake, dam, and road system inside the subdivision. The HHPOA also controls the bylaws which govern properties within Hickory Hills.

Copsi survived Tostig's defeat at Stamford Bridge, and when William the Conqueror prevailed at Hastings he travelled, in March 1067, to pay William homage at Barking (where William was staying while his tower was being constructed in London). In return, William made Copsi earl of Northumbria and sent him back to York.

Tequesta Indians thrived here before the first Europeans arrived in the early 16th century. The name is derived from the long natural limestone bridge that spanned the creek until 1973. It is part of the Arch Creek Memorial Park at 1855 Northeast 135th Street, on Biscayne Boulevard. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on July 15, 1986. History During the Seminole Wars, General Abner Doubleday (often credited with inventing baseball) blazed a trail between Fort Lauderdale and Fort Dallas on the Miami River. This Military Trail crossed over the limestone bridge, traversing the fresh water creek flowing from the Everglades to Biscayne Bay. In 1895, Henry Flagler's railroad reached Arch Creek as it expanded southward, bringing a steady stream of visitors and settlers, largely from east coast states...ff The first families to settle the area planted tomatoes and pineapples. A railroad depot was established in 1903. Soon after, a packing plant, a sawmill, a post office and a school were erected as the town began to grow. By 1910, the area was a popular place for tourists and community gatherings. The \\"shell house\\" sold souvenirs, postcards and refreshments. On weekends, families from many miles away would attend barbecues with as many as 500 people. \\"Dad\\" Wiggins, the self-proclaimed best barbecue chef in Florida, would start slow-cooking large amounts of meat and families would bring baked goods, side dishes and desserts while kids played along the banks of the creek. By 1912, the community included eighteen homes, a church, a general store, a blacksmith shop, and two tomato packing houses. By 1920, the population of Arch Creek had grown to 307. The Biscayne Canal was dug in 1924 to reduce flooding of farmland. During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, portions of the community were subdivided and sold to northern tourists as residential lots. On February 5, 1926, the incorporated Town of Miami Shores was established by a vote of 38 registered voters. A destructive hurricane in September 1926 brought land sales to a halt. However, proceeds of a $287,000 bond issue were used to build a new city hall in 1928. The Arch Creek school burned down in 1927 and was replaced in 1928 by the W.J. Bryan school, which is still in operation. The town kept the name of \\"Miami Shores\\" until 1931. In 1952 it was incorporated into the City of North Miami. In 1957, the first of many threats against the future of the natural bridge materialized. The bridge was endangered by a plan to drain low-lying areas as part of a flood prevention program. The Army Corps of Engineers wanted to blow up the bridge, or re-route the creek. A 1957 newspaper article announced that \\"the bridge must be sacrificed for better drainage of the area.\\" Protests from members of the local Audubon Society, the Historical Association of Southern Florida and the Dade Conservation Council prevented any of this destructive action. Things remained quiet until the 1970s, when Arch Creek became the property of the Chrysler Corporation. Their plans called for the construction of an automobile showroom, and a new and used car agency. In 1972, Chrysler requested a zoning change from the City of North Miami, which would have allowed them to pave the area and build a garage on the property. Vigorous opposition came from the Tropical Audubon Society, the Miami-West Indian Archaeological Society, the Keystone Point Homeowners' Association, and the members of the Arch Creek Trust. After almost a year, of intense lobbying the State of Florida agreed to purchase the land for a state park. The State's Land Acquisition Trust allocated $822,000 to buy of property east of the Creek. A group of local citizens, who later formed the organization Arch Creek Trust, went to Tallahassee in February 1973, to finalize the agreement. On the night they returned, the natural bridge collapsed and fell into the creek. Rumors of sabotage ran through the community, and the Metro-Dade Police Bomb Squad was called out. Nothing was discovered, and experts generally agreed later that the fall was probably due to constant vibrations from passing trains, or erosion, or just old age and decay. In the years that followed, there were various efforts to restore the bridge, clear the property of trash and save additional land in the area. The porous oolitic (pronounced oh-a-li- tic) limestone bridge was laced with roots from the oak trees growing on both banks of the creek, and likely those roots were what was holding the rock together. A number of trees near both ends of the bridge were removed, thus killing the roots. Then in order to keep vehicular traffic from using the bridge it was blocked off by boring a row of large holes through the road at both ends of the bridge, and standing discarded wooden railroad ties in the holes. When the bridge collapsed it broke along the two rows of \\"perforations\\" drilled for the ties. In March 2018, FIU Biscayne Bay Campus proposed to pave it as an additional road access to cars and allow another way to campus for first responders in case of an emergency, in light of the Parkland school shooting. However, despite the proposal passing in senate, it has faced strong protests from people who want to protect the reserve. Arch Creek Park Museum & Nature Center In 1978 Dade County leased the land from the State of Florida and began making plans to turn it into a passive recreation facility. Clean-up crews appeared, and construction started on a small museum and nature study center. A nature trail was constructed in the hammock area by the Youth Conservation Corps. In addition, they planted over 500 trees. The Arch Creek Park was formally dedicated on April 25, 1982. Today, Arch Creek is an site at the junction of N.E. 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard, and offers many opportunities for botanical, historical and archaeological study. It has a museum/nature center modeled after an early Florida pioneer home, displaying Indian artifacts dug from the grounds, and live animals from the nearby hammock. Remains of the original coontie mill are still visible across the creek, and the Park exists as the only preserved archaeological site in the County. In 1992, Arch Creek Trust and the Trust for Public Lands worked to acquire an additional at the northern end of the park, bringing the total size of the park to . Funding was provided by the Environmentally Endangered Lands (EEL) Program. In 1994 the park received a grant to add a Butterfly Garden, on this new site, using native butterfly-attracting plants. There are year-round activities at the park. Guided trail walks are held on the weekends, and many Miami-Dade County students visit on a regular basis.

History The sea front at Seascale The place-name indicates that it was inhabited by Norse settlers, probably before 1000 AD. It is derived from skali, meaning in Norse a wooden hut or shelter. This could well date from the time of King Harold Fairhair, who vowed revenge on the many Norsemen who had settled in Ireland and the Isle of Man, causing them to flee across the sea to the Cumbrian coast some time after AD 885. Many other Norse place names are to be found, including Seascale How, Skala Haugr, (the hill near the shelter), and Whitriggs, hvitihrgger (the white ridge). As the Norse penetrated inland other skalar were named, so Seascale was distinguished by reference to the sea.The Gosforth District, C A Parker. Pub Titus Wilson Kendal, 1904 The earliest written reference to Seascale is in the period 1154‚Äì1181, when an Aldwin de Seascale was witness to a deed made at Wetheral priory. Another early reference is in 1200 in a charter of Roger de Beauchamp to the priory of St. Bees. It states that land he gave to that monastery was near Leseschalis or Seascale, on the western coast.Houses of Benedictine nuns: The nunnery of Armathwaite, A History of the County of Cumberland: Volume 2 (1905), pp. 189‚Äì192. Ed J Wilson. About this time Alan de Coupland and William de Wabyrththwaite granted land to Walter de Sewnyhous in the nearby manor of Bolton, which remained in that family's possession for over 500 years. The present community of Hallsenna is derived from this name, being called Hall Sevenhouse, and later, Hall Senhouse. Seascale was part of the ancient parish of Gosforth, which was divided into the manors of Gosforth, Boonwood, Bolton High, Bolton Low and Seascale, who jointly elected a churchwarden for Gosforth church. The community of Seascale continued as a series of farms until the coming of the Furness Railway in 1850. This ran from Whitehaven to Barrow in Furness. Some small development took place in the wake of this, but it was recorded that in 1869 \\"there was not a shop in the place\\".Gissing and the Lake District, Frank J Woodman, 1980. The Gissing Society Newsletter Vol XVI Further development had to wait until 1879 when Sir James Ramsden of the Furness Railway promoted an ambitious plan to develop Seascale as a holiday resort. Edward Kemp of Birkenhead produced the designs, which included a large hotel, marine walks and villas, which would have stretched along of the coastline, however only a small number of buildings were constructed. The Scawfell Hotel, dating from that time and adjacent to the railway station, was demolished in 1997.The buildings of England ‚Äì Cumbria. Matthew Hyde and Nikolaus Pevsner, 2010. Yale University Press. The hotel's Victorian advertising made much of the fine beach and boasted its own bathing machines. Seascale was also promoted as an ideal centre for touring the western valleys of the Lake District. In 1881 the \\"Iron Church\\" of St Cuthbert was built, but was blown down in 1884. Although rebuilt, it was too small for the growing community, and in 1890 a stone church was built to the design of C F Ferguson. In 1886 the Methodist Church, also dedicated to St. Cuthbert, was built nearby. Little further development occurred until the establishment of the Royal Ordnance Factories at Sellafield and Drigg in 1939, both just a few miles away, when accommodation was built for munitions workers. In 1947 after World War II, the huge nuclear building programme at the former Sellafield ordnance factory commenced and Seascale became a dormitory community for the resultant Windscale and Calder Hall nuclear sites (later combined as Sellafield). As a result, in the 1950s it was known as \\"the brainiest town in Britain\\". Location It is located just outside the Lake District National Park. The large multi-function nuclear site Sellafield is away. Travelling by road, Seascale is to the north of Millom, to the north of Barrow in Furness, and to the south of Whitehaven. The village is close to the A595 and is served by Seascale railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line. Governance Seascale is within the Copeland UK Parliamentary constituency, Trudy Harrison is the Member of parliament. Before Brexit, its residents were covered by the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. For Local Government purposes it is in the Gosforth + Seascale ward of the Borough of Copeland and the Gosforth ward of Cumbria County Council. The village also has its own Parish Council; Seascale Parish Council, this electoral ward stretches to Scafell Pike and has a total population of 2,823 as taken at the 2011 Census. Literary associations The noted Victorian author George Gissing based part of one of his novels, The Odd Women, on Seascale and the Lake District. Gissing first visited in 1868/69 as a youngster, and although he only visited Seascale and the Lakes about four times, it left a tremendous impression on him, and he used material from his visits over the course of 30 years of writing. Shootings On 2 June 2010, the area became the centre of a search after a gunman ran amok in Cumbria. The gunman was identified as 52-year-old Whitehaven taxi driver Derrick Bird and is known to have killed twelve people and injured eleven others before taking his own life in Boot. Two of the victims were shot dead in Seascale; two others in the surroundings of the neighbouring village of Gosforth, along with another victim who was seriously wounded.

Biography Born in New York City, he was six years old when the Civil War started. Perhaps because of that he early developed a lifelong interest in American history, particularly in the Civil War and in the generals who fought it. His intense studies into history allowed Kelly to bring to his work a degree of detail that makes his drawings and statues noteworthy. Freehold, New Jersey. He studied at the National Academy of Design, and was one of the founders of the Art Students League of New York. He worked as a wood engraver, as an illustrator for Harper's Monthly and other magazines, and for a time shared a studio with artist Edwin Austin Abbey.Leach, p. 446. In 1882 Kelly was commissioned by Oscar Wilde and his touring manager to make a sketch and bas-relief of Wilde for use in promoting Wilde's lecture tour of North America. Kelly, Daniel Chester French, and Cyrus Edwin Dallin were the finalists in an 1883 national design competition to model an equestrian statue of Paul Revere for Boston, Massachusetts.George Wharton James, Utah: The Land of Blossoming Valleys (Boston: The Page Company, 1922), p. 303. Dallin won the competition and the commission. Kelly's first major commission was for the 1884 Monmouth Battle Monument - five bronze relief panels depicting scenes from the battle. He had a difficult time finding models who did not have mustaches or beards - then being worn by most men of that era - so he prevailed upon a friend from nearby Menlo Park, New Jersey, to pose for him. Because of that, a portrait of the 30-year-old Thomas Alva Edison can be found on the monument as Molly Pitcher's wounded husband.Leach, p. 450. Kelly was also known for his extremely detailed and accurate engravings on historical subjects, often commissioned by magazines. He was a careful researcher, interviewing the soldiers present at the Civil War battles he depicted, and exacting about getting the details right in his works. Late in life, he hoped to publish a book of his interviews with generals and other Civil War soldiers, but there was little interest. He married Helen McKay (1871-1929), but no children survived them. He died in New York City, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Saint Raymond's Cemetery. Historian William B. Styple edited Kelly's sometimes-provocative military interviews into a 2005 book, Generals in Bronze. Styple also raised funds to buy a headstone for Kelly's grave. On October 1, 2006, a black granite monument with Kelly's image carved into it and the words, \\"A Sculptor of American History\\" was placed over the artist's previously unmarked grave.William B.

It is owned and operated by Newell Brands. Graco was founded in 1942 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Russell Gray and Robert Cone (hence the name) as Graco Metal Products, a company that fabricated machine and car parts. Rex Thomas (one of two engineers hired to come up with a sustainable product) watched his wife sitting on the porch, rocking their baby in a swing with a string tied to it, while she read a book. Rex went into work the next day and said \\"why don't we make an automatic baby swing.\\" After 18 months of research and development, the Swyngomatic - the world's first wind-up, automatic baby swing was born in 1955, designed by company engineer Dave Saint. In 1987, the company pioneered the invention of the Pack N' Play Portable Playard, the world's first portable play yard (designed by Nate Saint, Dave Saint's son). In 1998, Graco acquired Century, a car seat manufacturer and introduced the SnugRide infant car seat, which has become America's top-selling infant car seat line. Century actually introduced the travel system where a car seat could fit on a stroller for easy transportation. That same year, Graco was acquired by Rubbermaid. A year later in 1999, the company was acquired by Newell Company and Newell became Newell Rubbermaid. In 2016 Newell Rubbermaid changed its name to Newell Brands when they acquired Jarden. In 2002, Graco launched the Turbo Booster, a booster seat designed to help parents stay in compliance with many states' passage of laws requiring children to stay in a car seat longer. In 2007, the company purchased established German baby product brand, Teutonia.

A divorce in Mexico was easier, quicker, and less expensive than a divorce in most U.S. states, which then only allowed at-fault divorces requiring extensive proof and lengthy court review. Celebrities who obtained a Mexican divorce include Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor (from Eddie Fisher), Marilyn Monroe (from Arthur Miller), Don Hewitt, Charlie Chaplin (from Paulette Goddard), Jayne Mansfield (from Mickey Hargitay), Stanley Kubrick, and Tom T. Chamales. It was often referred to as a quickie (sometimes spelled quicky) Mexican divorce. Historical context Mexico does not require spouses to be present at a divorce hearing; they can send a lawyer to represent them. This \\"fast-track\\" process is in contrast to American divorce procedures, which involve additional bureaucracy and added expense. A state in the United States is not required to recognize the validity of a Mexican divorce obtained by one of the state‚Äôs residents, because the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution does not apply to foreign judgments. The State of New York is the only state that recognizes the validity of a Mexican divorce obtained by a New York resident, so long as the divorce is bilateral (i.e. both parties appeared in the proceeding).Rosenstiel v.

In 1970, in accordance with a Mexican federal law recommendation, many courts stopped accepting divorce petitions from non-residents. Accordingly, petitioners must be selective in their choice of court. With the advent of no- fault divorce in the United States, Mexican divorces are not as popular as they once were. In popular culture The Mexican divorce is mentioned in the Jack Kerouac book On the Road. \\"Mexican Divorce\\" is the title of a 1961 song by Burt Bacharach and Bob Hilliard, which was issued as single in 1962 by The Drifters. It is also the song where Bacharach first met Dionne Warwick, one of the background singers, for whom he would later write numerous top hits. The song would be remade by Ry Cooder on his 1974 album Paradise and Lunch and by Nicolette Larson on her 1978 album Nicolette.Los Angeles Times 4 November 1978 \\"Last Stab at Alternative Top Ten\\" by Robert Hilburn p.II-9 Mexican divorce is also referenced in the song \\"What Do You Want from Life?\\" by The Tubes and in the Tom Waits song \\"The Part You Throw Away\\". A reference to a Mexican quickie divorce is also made in the episode \\"Up in Barney's Room\\" of The Andy Griffith Show (season 4, episode 10).

The method is also occasionally known as the \\"cross your heart\\" method because a heart can be drawn to remember which things to multiply together and the lines resemble a heart outline. Given an equation like: :\\\\frac a b = \\\\frac c d (where and are not zero), one can cross-multiply to get: :ad = bc \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{or} \\\\qquad a = \\\\frac {bc} d. In Euclidean geometry the same calculation can be achieved by considering the ratios as those of similar triangles.  Procedure  In practice, the method of cross-multiplying means that we multiply the numerator of each (or one) side by the denominator of the other side, effectively crossing the terms over. :\\\\frac a b warrow \\\\frac c d \\\\quad \\\\frac a b earrow \\\\frac c d. The mathematical justification for the method is from the following longer mathematical procedure. If we start with the basic equation: :\\\\frac a b = \\\\frac c d we can multiply the terms on each side by the same number and the terms will remain equal. Therefore, if we multiply the fraction on each side by the product of the denominators of both sides‚Äî‚Äîwe get: :\\\\frac a b \\\\times bd = \\\\frac c d \\\\times bd. We can reduce the fractions to lowest terms by noting that the two occurrences of b on the left- hand side cancel, as do the two occurrences of on the right-hand side, leaving: :ad = bc and we can divide both sides of the equation by any of the elements‚Äîin this case we will use ‚Äîgetting: :a = \\\\frac {bc} d. Another justification of cross-multiplication is as follows. Starting with the given equation: :\\\\frac a b = \\\\frac c d multiply by = 1 on the left and by = 1 on the right, getting: :\\\\frac a b \\\\times \\\\frac d d = \\\\frac c d \\\\times \\\\frac b b and so: :\\\\frac {ad} {bd} = \\\\frac {cb} {db}. Cancel the common denominator = , leaving: :ad = cb. Each step in these procedures is based on a single, fundamental property of equations. Cross-multiplication is a shortcut, an easily understandable procedure that can be taught to students.  Use  This is a common procedure in mathematics, used to reduce fractions or calculate a value for a given variable in a fraction. If we have an equation like this, where is a variable we are interested in solving for: :\\\\frac x b = \\\\frac c d we can use cross multiplication to determine that: :x = \\\\frac {bc} d. For example, suppose we want to know how far a car will travel in 7 hours, if we know that its speed is constant and that it already travelled 90 miles in the last 3 hours. Converting the word problem into ratios we get :\\\\frac x {7\\\\ \\\\mathrm{hours}} = \\\\frac {90\\\\ \\\\mathrm{miles}} {3\\\\ \\\\mathrm{hours}}. Cross- multiplying yields: :x = \\\\frac {7\\\\ \\\\mathrm{hours} \\\\times 90\\\\ \\\\mathrm{miles}} {3\\\\ \\\\mathrm{hours}} and so: :x = 210\\\\ \\\\mathrm{miles}. Note that even simple equations like this: :a = \\\\frac {x} {d} are solved using cross multiplication, since the missing term is implicitly equal to 1: :\\\\frac a 1 = \\\\frac x d. Any equation containing fractions or rational expressions can be simplified by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator. This step is called clearing fractions.  Rule of Three  The Rule of ThreeThis was sometimes also referred to as the Golden Rule, though that usage is rare compared to other uses of Golden Rule. See was an historical shorthand version for a particular form of cross-multiplication that could be taught to students by rote. It was considered the height of Colonial math education and still figures in the French national curriculum for secondary education. For an equation of the form: :\\\\frac a b = \\\\frac c x where the variable to be evaluated is in the right-hand denominator, the Rule of Three states that: :x = \\\\frac {bc} a. In this context, is referred to as the extreme of the proportion, and and are called the means. This rule was already known to Chinese mathematicians prior to the 2nd century CE, though it was not used in Europe until much later. The Rule of Three gained notoriety for being particularly difficult to explain. Cocker's Arithmetick, the premier textbook in the 17th century, introduces its discussion of the Rule of Three with the problem, \\"If 4 Yards of Cloth cost 12 Shillings, what will 6 Yards cost at that Rate?\\" The Rule of Three gives the answer to this problem directly; whereas in modern arithmetic, we would solve it by introducing a variable to stand for the cost of 6 yards of cloth, writing down the equation: :\\\\frac {4\\\\ \\\\mathrm{yards}} {12\\\\ \\\\mathrm{shillings}} = \\\\frac {6\\\\ \\\\mathrm{yards}} { x} and then using cross-multiplication to calculate : :x = \\\\frac {12\\\\ \\\\mathrm{shillings} \\\\times 6\\\\ \\\\mathrm{yards}} {4\\\\ \\\\mathrm{yards}} = 18\\\\ \\\\mathrm{shillings}. An anonymous manuscript dated 1570Concise Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 1964 said: \\"Multiplication is vexation, / Division is as bad; / The Rule of three doth puzzle me, / And Practice drives me mad.\\" = Double Rule of Three = An extension to the Rule of Three was the Double Rule of Three, which involved finding an unknown value where five rather than three other values are known. An example of such a problem might be If 6 builders can build 8 houses in 100 days, how many days would it take 10 builders to build 20 houses at the same rate? and this can be set up as :\\\\frac {\\\\frac {8\\\\ \\\\mathrm{houses}}{100\\\\ \\\\mathrm{days}}} {6\\\\ \\\\mathrm{builders}} = \\\\frac {\\\\frac {20\\\\ \\\\mathrm{houses}}{x}} {10\\\\ \\\\mathrm{builders}} which, with cross-multiplication twice, gives : x = \\\\frac {20\\\\ \\\\mathrm{houses} \\\\times 100\\\\ \\\\mathrm{days}\\\\times 6\\\\ \\\\mathrm{builders} } {8\\\\ \\\\mathrm{houses} \\\\times 10\\\\ \\\\mathrm{builders}} = 150 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{days} Lewis Carroll's The Mad Gardener's Song includes the lines \\"He thought he saw a Garden-Door / That opened with a key: / He looked again, and found it was / A double Rule of Three\\"Sylvie and Bruno, Chapter 12 See also * Cross-ratio * Odds ratio References  Further reading  * Brian Burell: Merriam-Webster's Guide to Everyday Math: A Home and Business Reference.

Biography McNeill was born in Kingston, Jamaica and educated at Excelsior School and St. George's College (where he was already known to his friends as a poet) before leaving to study in the United States. He studied creative writing at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, from which he graduated with a PhD. He returned to Jamaica in 1975, where he worked as a journalist and assistant editor of the Jamaica Journal (1975‚Äì81), as well as in a variety of other jobs, including civil servant, encyclopedia salesman, and janitor. While a student in the US, McNeill began writing seriously. His first major collection of poems, Reel from \\"The Life Movie\\", appeared in 1972 and immediately established his reputation in Jamaica alongside his contemporaries Dennis Scott and Mervyn Morris. This was followed by Credences at the Altar of Cloud (1979) and Chinese Lanterns from the Blue Child, published posthumously in 1998. Other significant work remains unpublished. McNeill was known for his experimental style, influenced by contemporary jazz as well as American poets like Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and E. E. Cummings. He once said, of his first collection, \\"I don't think I could write if my first concern wasn't for the aesthetic.\\" He also claimed that his greatest ambition was to be a jazz pianist.

The company was formerly owned by Gateway Global Ltd., which was based in Costa Mesa, California. History AUTOart was established in 1998 (AUTOart website). Other lines of diecast vehicles formerly associated with AUTOart were Gateway, Gate and UT Models. The latter was originally a German company with diecast cars made in China and associated with Paul's Model Art which produces Minichamps. AUTOart makes diecast model cars, slot racing cars, and diecast motorcycles. A line of Radio controlled cars is also planned. AEROart is another division producing aircraft models. AUTOart Design offers offbeat automobilia like 'shock absorber' pens, carbon fiber tissue boxes, or ashtray and clock in the form of a disc brake rotor with caliper. Their most popular item is their 1:18 scale diecast cars which go for around 100 and 1000 US dollars. Models AUTOart late 1970s Porsche 911 Carrera. Note precise detail in seat cloth design, rear view mirrors, windshield wipers and logos. Bugatti Veyron model Subaru Impreza World Rally Championship 2003 model AUTOart has produced more than 45 different car marques in nine different scales. Sizes generally range from 1:64 scale (2 to 3 inches long) to 1:12 scale (about 12 to 14 inches; see Koch 2007). Wheels & tires, carpeting, seat belts, door handles, engines, suspension, even sun visors and door/hood/trunk lid dampers are reproduced. As an example, the company's 1:18 scale 1971 Mustang featured accurate details down to engine wiring, underside hood insulation, wood grain inserts in the doors, and authentically detailed brake and accelerator pedals (Doty 2004a, 87). The 1:18 scale 1941 Willys military Jeep features accurate weld rivets, shaped reflectors, wood shovel and ax, tied whip antenna, and accurate period dashboard labels (Sufficool 2012). Dennis Doty, an authority on models of all kinds, and a contributor to Collectible Automobile Magazine, calls AUTOart models \\"truly spectacular\\" (Doty 2004b, 89). Many AUTOart models are of exotic racing, sports, or super performance vehicles like the white, red, and blue BMW 3.0 CSL 1973 winner at Spa, or the Showroom Stock 2007 Mustang Road Racer, but more mundane vehicles like the New Beetle or the Chrysler PT Cruiser are also produced. One interesting example is the 1989 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, a car offered by Kaiser, AMC, and Chrysler over a period of twenty-five years (Doty 2004b, 89). Featured on it were accurate and realistic period wheels, turn signals, roof rack, vinyl 'wood' siding, and a working tailgate (Doty 2004b). The AUTOart line favors, but is not limited to, European vehicles. One example reviewed in Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car was the company's 1970 Lamborghini Espada 2+2 which the magazine saw as a good model choice ‚Äì distinct from the plethora of model Countaches or Diablos (LaChance 2009). Thus AUTOart features both new vehicles, like the C7 Corvette or Lamborghini Veneno, as well as vintage racing cars like the 1965 Formula 1 Honda raced at Monaco. Historic racing cars have also included a number of other Can Am and Grand Prix cars from the 1960s and 1970s. The earliest years of actual vehicles represented in the line-up are from about 1938, with the BMW 328 Mille Miglia. American Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptors and British \\"Humberside Police\\" Subaru Imprezas along with a Mercedes-Benz E220 Berlin taxi are examples that show the company includes professional vehicles alongside stock and race cars. Additionally, several Italian Vespa scooters have been offered. Australian market Holdens and Chryslers are also featured, but here another firm comes into play. Biante Model Cars of Australia were made in the AUTOart factory in China with several models boxed under both names (Koch 2006). Biante was the company of Trevor Young, who died in 2006. More recently, AUTOart has also produced TV and film tie-in vehicles, like the Mad Max Road Warrior 1973 Australian Ford Falcon Interceptor driven by Mel Gibson, the Gulf Porsche 917 driven by Steve McQueen in the movie LeMans, or the Toyota Trueno from the anime show Initial D. All of these were offered in 1:18 scale. The Mad Max car was also offered in 1:43. Autoart is moving towards replicating cars in composite plastic and with diecast interior instead of a traditional diecast body and plastic chassis. The company claims that the move towards plastic should result in more accurate details, such as panel lines, as well as the models costing less than their diecast counterparts. Promotionals AUTOart models marketed under the Gateway/Gate label are often of more common brands and more likely to be found in retail stores or as dealer promotionals. As an example, when the Saturn VUE SUV was introduced mid-2002, AUTOart was selected by General Motors to provide a detailed 1:18 scale dealership promotional model. It was packaged in Saturn logo boxes, usually painted metallic burnt orange ‚Äì the same paint used on the actual car. Hood, tailgate, and front doors all opened. This practice of providing a larger metal model with opening parts and made in China was significantly different than the previous use of Detroit area plastic companies used for promotional models and products. Despite promotionals with many opening parts, one AUTOart line, their 1:18 \\"Motorsports\\" series has been criticized for having none, yet with no break in price. The company has defended their product by saying that Motorsports teams are ever more sensitive about releasing photos that might give away interior, suspension and engine bay details to their racing competitors, yet they must develop and produce marketing models for motorsports teams within short time frames. Thus, these models have sealed bodies with few or no opening parts (The Anatomy 2006). Legal issues In 2004, a lawsuit in Hong Kong courts was initiated against UT Models and Gateway Global and Gateway Hong Kong by the plaintiff, Paul's Model Art of Germany (known mostly for marketing Minichamps). Paul's Model Art claimed that it had rights to the sole distribution of certain models in Germany and that UT Models had used Gateway for new offerings to circumvent this deal (see Johnson 1998, p. 241 for more on UT Models' relationship with Paul's Model Art). At this time the lawsuit between AUTOArt's parent company (Gateway Global) and Paul's Model Art is still ongoing, but seems to be leaning in Gateway's favor.

Its former deer park extended east into the Henley Park area of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire that abuts it to the south. Following World War II, it was run as Divine Mercy College by the Polish Congregation of Marian Fathers, with its associated library, museum and was one of the cultural centres for the Polish minority in the United Kingdom until its closure and sale in the 2009. It is listed at Grade I for its architecture. Parts and location The main building sit five times its length away from the river, 600m along the 2112m Henley Royal Regatta course and has a private promenade covering approximately half of the course, adjoining its two small farms to the south.Fawley Court and Temple Island park and garden ‚Äì grade II* ‚Äì Its former deer park extended west into the Henley Park area of Henley-on- Thames, Oxfordshire, which has an even larger estate, but more modest buildings. The town itself adjoins to the south, with the considerably smaller Phyllis Court being the closest neighbour. History =Early history= Under Edward the Confessor in 1065 the Domesday Book notes Earl Tosti held this land as the manor of Fawley, connected with the village itself which sits atop the hill behind.Domesday Map . Retrieved 10 June 2013. After the Conquest, Fawley Manor was given by William I to his kinsman Walter Giffard, who was one of the leading compilers of the Domesday Book. His steward Herbrand de Sackville was holding it when the book was compiled in 1086, and the Sackvilles held it until it passed through the marriage of the Sackville heiress Margery, to Thomas Rokes, in 1477. Bulstrode Whitelocke from NPG In 1616, Fawley was sold to Sir James Whitelocke, a judge who also bought adjoining smaller Phyllis Court and larger Henley Park. On his death in 1632 Fawley passed to his son, Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke, who was a parliamentarian and judge who also owned much land in Remenham. During the Civil War, Fawley was the scene of fighting between the Roundheads and Royalist troops commanded by Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Since Bulstrode Whitelocke was a Parliament supporter, Royalist soldiers were quartered in the house under Sir John Byron having ransacked it in 1642. After the Restoration of the Monarchy Bulstrode gave the damaged house to his son James Whitelocke, who, having failed to repair it, sold it to Colonel William Freeman. In 1684 the house was completely rebuilt for Freeman, a plantation and slave owner and merchant.Attributions to Sir Christopher Wren made by the local historian R. H. Whitelocke, Memoirs of Burstrode Whitelocke, and in the Victoria County History of England are not supported by documents or patronage connections and are ignored by recent architectural historians. The resulting house is a large square brick and stone house with two tall storeys, plus basement and attic. The symmetrical plan is ranged either side of an entrance hall entered from the west, with the identically-proportioned saloon beyond; the principal apartments and staircases are placed in equal-sized blocks on either side, projecting slightly on the west and east fronts. The stair hall in the southwest block opens from the entrance hall; it has twist-turned balusters typical of the late seventeenth century. The centres of the north and south fronts are slightly broken forward and capped with pediments. There is an Ionic entrance portico on the west front. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, William III of Orange stayed in the house during his march from Torbay to London, and received a loyal declaration from peers and an address from the Corporation of London. Interior finishing was ongoing however as the plasterwork of the saloon ceiling bears the date 1690; bearing the arms of Freeman and of Baxter, William's spouse. Its confident bold relief tempted Geoffrey Beard to ascribe it to London plasterer William Parker, whose comparable work at Denham Place is documented.Geoffrey Beard, Decorative Plasterwork in Great Britain(London: Phaidon) 1975:52. Following Freeman's death the estate passed to John Cooke his nephew, a merchant, dilettante and amateur architect, who under William's will changed his name to Freeman. He was an early member of the Society of Antiquaries, built the Gothic folly in the grounds and the Freeman family mausoleum in the village based on the design of the tomb of Caecilla Metella in Rome. He buried a time capsule of contemporary artefacts in a mound resembling a round barrow on the estate. These were rediscovered in the early 20th century when the site was excavated by archaeologists. Examples of its many day to day household items of the early 18th century are in the River and Rowing Museum in Henley.

Shortly thereafter the architect James Wyatt, not yet made famous by his Pantheon, London, worked on decorations in new rooms in the house (1770‚Äì71), where doorcases and chimneypieces in Wyatt's early neoclassical style and the decoration of the Library reflect his presence. Fawley may have been Wyatt's first country house commission.Eileen Harris and John Martin Robinson, \\"New Light on Wyatt at Fawley\\" Architectural History 27, Design and Practice in British Architecture: Studies in Architectural History Presented to Howard Colvin (1984:263‚Äì267), suggested p. 264. He also designed \\"the temple\\", a folly and fishing lodge, on Temple Island.Howard Colvin, Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600‚Äì1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press) 1995, s.v.\\"James Wyatt\\". One of two drawings securely attributed to Wyatt that appeared at a Christie's auction, 30 November 1983, is for the interior of the island temple, which was the earliest essay in England of an \\"Etruscan\\" style,Robert Adam's first venture into an \\"Etruscan\\" scheme was in 1774 for Derby House, London; his most famous one was the Etruscan room at Osterley Park, Middlesex. (Eileen Harris, The Furniture of Robert Adam; Eileen Harris and John Martin Robinson, \\"New Light on Wyatt at Fawley\\" Architectural History 27, Design and Practice in British Architecture: Studies in Architectural History Presented to Howard Colvin [1984:263‚Äì267]; the authors offer evidence that Freeman's connection to Wyatt came through his Sambrooke relatives, his mother's family). its pale green walls painted as if hung with \\"antique\\" black and terracotta figured tablets and medallions. The drawing that accompanied it is for the Drawing Room ceiling, as executed. Drawings by James Wyatt's brother SamuelAmong Freeman papers in the Gloucester Record Office among papers deposited by the Strickland family of Apperley, Harrisand Robinson 1984:265. suggested to Eileen Harris that he was responsible for the barn with an apsidal end, which survives (with some nineteenth-century changes) at Fawley. The recent improvements at Fawley were praised by Mrs Lybbe Powys in 1771. The brick facades were stuccoed about 1800, and were restored with new brick in the nineteenth century. Both George III and George IV visited the house. =19th century to 1950s= Fawley Court, Buckinghamshire in 1826From Views of the seats of noblemen and gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, Second Series, Volume III, by John Preston Neale, 1826 Strickland Freeman, the son of Sambrooke Freeman, wrote works on equitation and veterinary aspects of horsemanship and botany. A very progressive landlord to his agricultural tenants he participated in advancing farming techniques and practices deemed by some revolutionary. Strickland Freeman died without a son and heir. This was basically the end of the Freeman line whose history and achievements in a relatively short time frame were indeed meritorious and make fascinating readingFawley Court and the Freeman Family ‚Äì 1971 The estate passed to William Peere Williams, a distant relative. He again respected William Freeman's will to be able entitled inherit and changed his name to William Peere Williams- Freeman. After extensive and lengthy litigation his heirs eventually put the estate up for auction. Fawley Court was sold to the railway contractor Edward Mackenzie in 1853. He retired to Fawley following many successful ventures developing major stages of the railway network in France, following the decline due to ill health and death of his partner and brother, the famous civil engineer and railway builder, William Mackenzie. Edward Mackenzie himself died in 1880, and the house was inherited by his son, William Dalziel Mackenzie, who commissioned the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin to extend the house. This took place in 1883, and consisted of the addition of a wing, containing a study, a billiard room, smoking rooms, and bedrooms, together with terraces around the house. It is reputed to have been Kenneth Grahame's inspiration for Toad Hall in his book The Wind in the Willows, written in 1908. Fawley Court was requisitioned by the British Army and used in the World War II by special forces for training. Maurice Roe (b. 4 June 1917 - d.6/5/2014 - military medal 1945) was trained there as a radio operator prior to his insertion into France as described by the obituary on the Telegraph 26 June 2014. He served both as a commando and as a member of the SOE (special operations executive) and as a Jedburgh. It was left it in a poor state after the war. Polish cultural destination =Divine Mercy College= In 1953 the house and surrounding grounds with an exceptional river frontage on the Thames were purchased by the British province of the Polish Congregation of Marian Fathers, in answer to the demand from the post World War II newly settled Polish community, for use as an independent educational establishment known as, Divine Mercy College and as a religious house. The enterprise was in straitened financial circumstances from the start and, as a charitable institution, relied heavily on public support to build the residential accommodation for the pupils and to keep it running. It was intended for boys of Polish descent but accepted local children as well as those from overseas, e.g. from Ghana. At its peak the school catered for 150 boys of 9 to 19 years of age and offered a rounded education including university entrance exams. An alumnus of the time is Waldemar Januszczak, the prominent British art critic (born 1954). The house was severely damaged by fire in 1973, but was rebuilt with the help of donations from the Polish community in Britain and abroad. The school finally closed in 1986 due to falling rolls of students of Polish origin, and the Marian Fathers converted Fawley Court into a 'Retreat and Conference Centre'. Jarzƒôbowski (1897-1964) founder of Divine Mercy College and Fawley Court Museum Fawley Court's 'Jarzƒôbowski' Museum The energetic founder and headmaster, Fr. J√≥zef Jarzƒôbowski, was captivated by history, especially events around the 1863 January Uprising. He was also a keen collector, since before the war, of Polish Militaria and historical materials. Fortuitously, they found a suitable setting in the august Wyatt interiors of the main house. In time, Fawley Court housed a Museum of national significance and is the subject of a detailed study published by the National Library of Poland.Fawley Court : Pa≈Çac i Muzeum : Historic House and Museum, Authors: Danuta Szewczyk-Prokurat; Maria Wrede; Philip Earl Steele, Warszawa: published by Biblioteka Narodowa, 2003, in Polish and English. The collection comprised a number of sculptures, most notably an Antonine period marble bust said to be of the juvenile Commodus, that Fr. Jarzƒôbowski had brought back from Mexico in 1944. It had been on loan to the Ashmolean Museum (1973-1985) but after a failed attempt to sell it in 1985, it was finally sold at a Christie's auction in 2005. Also sold in 1985 was an earlier acquisition, by John Freeman, of a fragment from the Pergamon Altar that Freeman had placed over the entrance to the Gothic folly in the grounds. The Jarzƒôbowski collection also contained: an armoury of the 16th‚Äì19th centuries of European, Asian and Far Eastern provenance, other militaria ranging from the last Polish uprising to World War II, French, Portuguese and Polish tapestries of the 16th-18th centuries, Italian Baroque paintings, drawings, including by Annibale Carracci, sacred art including icons, coins, medals and a notable philatelic collection. Library and Archive The book collection consisted of around 15,000 volumes from the 19th and 20th centuries, relating to history, theology and travel. In addition there were 450 prints of the 16th‚Äì18th centuries of Western European and Polish origin. There were also seven Incunables pressed in the 15th century. Among the first editions were early piano compositions by Maria Szymanowska. Among the 250 or so manuscripts, were the autographs of poets and writers from 1815 to 1983, documents issued by Polish kings (up to the XVIIIc.) and Papal bulls and letters by national heroes. There was also a significant cartographic collection. The Museum and Library became a member institution of the Standing Conference of Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West. In September 2002 the Fawley Court Museum played host to the Standing Conference scholars' annual meeting.http://mabpz.org/ Website of the Standing Conference of Polish Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West (in Polish). Prior to being dismantled, Fawley Court and its museum was a member organisation of the Standing Conference, which held its first meeting in 1981 at the Chateau de Montresor in France. =St Anne's Church and Columbarium= The school and the museum also served for over half a century as a popular meeting place on feast days for the wider Polish community. Indeed, it became a destination for the Polish diaspora in that it led Prince Stanis≈Çaw Albrecht Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (husband of Lee Bouvier-Radziwill, younger sister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) to fund the erection of St. Anne's church in the grounds and a burial place for his mother and other family members. The church in striking modernist style, reminiscent of Zakopane Style architecture, was commissioned from Polish architect, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarosz, from the architectural practice, Crabtree and Jarosz and completed in 1971.Proctor, Robert. Building the Modern Church: Roman Catholic Church Architecture in Britain 1955-1975, London: Routledge, 2016, 412 pages, , p. 21. It is Grade II listed by English Heritage. He died in 1976 and was himself interred in the church's crypt, so confident had he been of the Polish commitment to this jewel of the English countryside. =Sale= In 2008 the Polish Province of the Marian Fathers put the estate up for sale due to financial difficulties.Forced to sell Fawley Court , Henley Standard, 25 April 2008 It was purchased in 2009 by a property investor for ¬£13m. The sale has generated a controversy within the Polish community in UK and in the Polish media. A number of court cases have arisen from the sale. The museum and library collection have been divided between the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London and several museums in Poland, with majority of the exhibits transferred to the newly opened J√≥zef Jarzƒôbowski Museum in Liche≈Ñ Stary. Following the sale and renovation, the estate has become a country club. Heritage listing Fawley Court is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

It is also a major supporter of the arts, most notably with its prestigious annual music competition. Founded by Sir Evelyn Wrench in 1910 as the Over- Seas Club, it was given a Royal Charter of Incorporation in 1922 and Queen Elizabeth II granted the title \\"Royal\\" to mark its golden jubilee in 1960. Wrench saw the British Empire of the time as not merely a political and economic structure, but also \\"a far-flung brotherhood of individual men and women of diverse creeds and races living widely apart under differing conditions in different latitude\\". The league today is both an association of individual members and a supporter of Commonwealth art, music and welfare projects. The ROSL clubhouse in Edinburgh closed in January 2018, but ROSL continues to have a national and international presence from honorary representatives, a network of branches and reciprocal clubs in more than 100 countries. Facilities and activities Accommodation, dining and conference facilities are offered at the London clubhouses. The London clubhouse is at the end of Park Place, a cul-de-sac off St James's Street in the West End backing onto Green Park and has its own private garden. The clubhouse and the regional branches organise a variety of cultural and social events for members, such as backstage tours of London attractions, wine tastings, literary lectures and visits to shows and performances. The league has an in- house magazine, Overseas published quarterly, which comprises contemporary features written by renowned journalists, members‚Äô articles, news from regional branches, and information about forthcoming events. Membership Prospective members of the Royal Over-Seas League must be proposed by an existing member, and seconded by another of \\"recognised standing\\". Full members must be a national of a Commonwealth member state. Those from other countries may only become associate members. There are 16,000 members worldwide at the various international branches. Membership fees are based on proximity to the London clubhouse, or age (under 30s enjoy a reduced rate of membership). Members who have held their membership for a period of 30 continuous years also pay a reduced subscription.  ROSL ARTS  For over 65 years ROSL ARTS has developed a diverse portfolio of activities in music, visual arts, and literature. ROSL ARTS is devoted to the career development of talented young professional artists and musicians from the UK and the Commonwealth, and also presents readings and literary events at its central London headquarters. The principal ways in which ROSL ARTS supports artists and musicians is through the ROSL Annual Music Competition, ROSL Commonwealth Music Scholarships, and ROSL Commonwealth Visual Arts Scholarships. ROSL ARTS also provides performance and exhibition opportunities for its prizewinning artists and musicians early in their careers, and thus brings their work to the attention of the professional arts community, the media, and the general public. ROSL ARTS is supported by the membership and clubhouse operations of the Royal Over-Seas League and the ROSL Golden Jubilee Trust Fund (registered charity no 306095), as well as donations and sponsorship from many sources: businesses such as Harrods Bank and Coutts & Co; charitable trusts including the John Ellerman Foundation, the Rayne Foundation, the Underwood Trust, the Weinstock Fund; numerous private benefactors; the Friends of ROSL ARTS. ROSL ARTS has collaborated and received support from the national arts councils of several Commonwealth countries, the British Council, Visiting Arts and UK regional arts boards. ROSL ARTS has collaborated with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in presenting outstanding young Commonwealth artists and musicians at the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. Music competition ROSL organises an annual competition for musicians aged under 30. There are two ensemble awards and four solo awards, with the solo winners then competing for the Competition Gold Medal and First Prize. The Chairman of Adjudicators for the 2014 awards was Gavin Henderson. The Gold Medal competition was held at the Southbank Centre and it was won by saxophonist Huw Wiggin (Royal College of Music). The ensemble awards were won by Block4 (Royal College of Music) and the Solem Quartet (Royal Northern College of Music). Gold Medal award winners since 2000 include Jonathan Lemalu bass-baritone, Juliette Bausor flute, Lucy Crowe soprano, Martin Cousin piano, Amy Dickson saxophone, Timothy Orpen clarinet, John Myerscough cello, Pei-Sian Ng cello, Laura Lucas flute, Ben Schoeman piano, Jonathan McGovern baritone, Jayson Gillham piano, Morgan Pearse baritone, Huw Wiggin saxophone, Alexander Soares piano, Emily Sun violin, James Buckle bass trombone and Jonathan Radford saxophone.

J. Adams Don Bombard (born December 16, 1948), known professionally as Bob Shannon, is an American radio disc jockey best known for his work on WCBS-FM in New York City. He is also the author of the book Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll. He has a son, Scott (no relation to current WCBS-FM morning DJ Scott Shannon), and a daughter, Avery. Early life Don Bombard was first introduced on radio by sportscaster Marv Albert as the winner of a guest deejay contest while still a junior high school student in his hometown of Syracuse, New York. At age 15, Bombard experimented with broadcasting from his home, using a radio that had the wiring reversed to become a transmitter. The radio's antenna was hooked to a radiator, utilizing the water pipes to get the signal out to his neighborhood. In high school he partnered with Jody Carmen and Mel Cowznofski in the Big 50 \\"Hits of the Week Survey, which was printed and distributed in Syracuse, NY to local record stores. He joined the staff of Syracuse University station WAER-FM as a freshman in 1965. Bombard came to the attention of the local Syracuse Top 40 stations WNDR and WOLF when, as a teenager, he compiled and distributed his own weekly music survey known as The Big 50. Bombard then went on to work at both stations from 1967 to 1977, where he gained experience as an announcer, music director, and programmer. He joined WNDR in 1967 as a part-time weekend DJ. In 1968, he accepted an offer by WOLF to work full-time on their night show. He became the station's music director and started an all-request show. In 1969, he was part of the team that returned WOLF to a Top 40 format and remained as music director and night DJ until the following year, when he was hired back full-time at WNDR. There, he hosted a late-night \\"Attitude Hours\\" progressive rock show. Later he became assistant program director and afternoon drive DJ, as well as taking over the reins of the \\"Saturday Night of Gold\\" oldies show. In 1975, he left radio briefly to run \\"Don Bombard Disco,\\" a company formed with partner Guy Capone. He returned to WOLF the following year and became program director. While in Syracuse, Bombard collaborated with local music historian Ron Wray (aka Ron Gersbacher) on a documentary history of WOLF (\\"The WOLF Story\\") and a series of \\"History of Syracuse Music\\" albums. He also formed (with Wray) Piece Records. Move to Pittsburgh In 1977, Bombard moved to Pittsburgh to work at station 13Q (WKTQ). He began as production director and then moved to afternoon drive dj. He originated and hosted ‚ÄúThe Sunday Night Oldies Party‚Äù. Bombard also released (with record collector Frank DeMino) a compilation album called \\"The Pittsburgh Hall of Fame\\". He also did booth announcing for WIIC (now WPXI) television. Arrival at WCBS-FM In late 1981 Bombard moved to New York City to work part-time at a recording studio owned by Wendell Craig, formerly dj Windy Craig at WOLF. While there, with Craig's blessings, he launched a radio syndication company called Sirius Productions. Bombard then began as a fill-in announcer at WYNY (now WQHT). Shortly after, he would leave WYNY for WCBS-FM and began doing some booth announcing for WOR-TV. He used his given name on WYNY, but at CBS-FM (which already had Don K. Reed) his on-air name was changed to Bobby Shannon by program director Joe McCoy. Gradually, his air name evolved to Bob Shannon. Shannon launched a weekend overnight spin-off of his Pittsburgh show on WCBS-FM called \\"The Oldies Party\\" and continued to tape a weekly Sunday night show for airing in Pittsburgh. He also briefly hosted the Saturday night show vacated by Jack Spector. In 1982, he was promoted to the full-time 6-10PM shift and originated (with music director Richard Lorenzo) a nightly \\"Hall of Fame\\" segment. This segment played \\"wall- to-wall\\" music from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. by a selected artist or a couple artists (if the artists each had only a few big hits). For bigger artists with many hits, the hall of fame feature sometimes began at 8 p.m. In 1986, with the exit of Dick Heatherton, he took over the afternoon drive time slot, where he remained until the station's two-year \\"sabbatical\\" that began in 2005. The Hall Of Fame was revamped in evenings to feature several to half a dozen songs an hour by a selected artists mixed in with other regularly played music. Bobby Jay took over except on Wednesdays. On Wednesday, Cousin Bruce Morrow took over. At that point, on Thursdays the Hall Of Fame was strictly 60s music and on Fridays strictly 50s. At WCBS-FM, on the 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. timeslot, he programmed music features such as \\"Rockeology\\", \\"Hands Across the Water\\", \\"First and Foremost\\", \\"lost hits\\", \\"songs with the same title but are different\\", \\"Wednesday Fourplay/Three For The Road\\", and others. In 1986 he collected his interviews with music acts into a book, \\"Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll\\", co-authored with John Javna. Shannon hosted a number of nationally syndicated radio shows, including \\"The Oldies Countdown\\" for MJI Broadcasting and \\"Keeping The '70s Alive\\" and \\"Behind The Hits\\" for On The Radio Broadcasting. He co-hosted, with WCBS-FM's Bobby Jay, live broadcasts for Westwood One from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies in New York. In June 2005 WCBS-FM switched to an \\"Adult Hits\\" format called Jack FM which used no live DJs. Shannon began a weekly show with his wife, Connie T. Empress, on WLNG, Long Island, NY. He also hosted a weekly Internet program, ‚ÄúBehind the Hits‚Äù, on Vip radio in Europe. He also broadcast weekly internet radio shows at RadioMaxMusic, and was instrumental in the creation of the Across The Tracks format used there. He worked briefly at New Jersey's \\"The Breeze\\" WWZY/WBHX in 2007, and took part in the station's Radio Greats Weekend in July 2007 after his return to WCBS-FM. CBS-FM Returns When WCBS-FM came back to New York radio on July 12, 2007, Shannon helped launch the return. On November 18, as part of CBS- FM's weekly Radio Greats feature, he hosted a show as Don Bombard. Shannon stopped performing his mid-day shift at WCBS-FM in late December 2011 or early 2012.He was eventually replaced by Ron Parker.

Osulf‚Äôs family ruled as \\"High-Reeves\\" (ealdormen) of Bamburgh from 954 until 1041, when Siward the Stout killed Eadulf and reunited Northumbria under one ruler. In 1065, Morcar succeeded Tostig as Earl of all Northumbria, and he appointed Osulf to rule the portion north of the River Tyne. However, because of Morcar‚Äôs resistance to the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, he was deposed and imprisoned. William then appointed Copsi (sometimes Copsig), Tostig‚Äôs former deputy, as Morcar's replacement. In February 1067, Copsi came north and forced Osulf to seek shelter in the hills. Osulf began to gather an army. Because Copsi was seen as an invader and a tax- gatherer for William, he was deeply unpopular among the Northumbrians north and south of the Tees, and Osulf had no trouble in gathering recruits. On 12 March, he surprised Copsi and his men at a banquet at Newburn-upon-Tyne. Copsi fled to a nearby church but this was set on fire, forcing Copsi out. Osulf then had Copsi's head cut off. Osulf appears to have seized control of the earldom of Bamburgh, and was not threatened by any expeditions to remove him. However, in the autumn of 1067, Osulf, who appears to have been carrying out his duties as earl, intercepted an outlaw and was run through by the man‚Äôs spear. He was succeeded as earl by his cousin, Cospatric, who purchased the earldom from King William.

The period is noted for the change from absolutist monarchies to representative governments with a written constitution, and the creation of nation states. Influenced by the new ideas of the Enlightenment, the American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783) is usually considered the starting point of the Age of Revolution. It in turn inspired the French Revolution of 1789, which rapidly spread to the rest of Europe through its wars. In 1799, Napoleon took power in France and continued the French Revolutionary Wars by conquering most of continental Europe. Although Napoleon imposed to its conquests several modern concepts such as equality before the law, or a civil code, his rigorous military occupation triggered national rebellions, notably in Spain and Germany. After Napoleon's defeat, European great powers forged the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna in 1814‚Äì15‚Äîin an attempt to prevent future revolutions‚Äîand also restored the previous monarchies. Nevertheless, Spain was considerably weakened by the Napoleonic Wars and could not control its American colonies, almost all of which proclaimed their independence between 1810 and 1820. Revolution then spread back to southern Europe in 1820, with uprisings in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. Continental Europe was shaken by two similar revolutionary waves in 1830 and 1848, also called the Spring of Nations. The democratic demands of the revolutionaries often merged with independence or national unification movements, such as in Italy, Germany, Poland, Hungary, etc. The violent repression of the Spring of Nations marked the end of the era. The expression was popularised by the British historian Eric Hobsbawm in his book The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789‚Äì1848, published in 1962.Hobsbawm, Eric, The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789‚Äì1848, London, Abacus (1962). Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. It marked a major turning point in history and almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. This led to a rapid expansion of cities that resulted in social strains and disturbances. For instance, economic grievances associated with this industrialization fed later revolutions such as those that transpired from 1848. New social classes emerged including those that began to reject orthodox politics. This is demonstrated by the rise of the urban middle class, which became a powerful force so that they had to be integrated into the political system. The upheavals also led to old political ideas that were directed against the social arrangements of the preindustrial regime. American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783) American Revolution The Thirteen Colonies of British America became independent in the American Revolution of 1776. The movement was the first European colony to claim independence and followed the drafting of a United States Constitution that included a number of original features within a federated representative democracy and a system of Separation of powers checks and balances. Those include but are not limited to an elected head of state, property rights, due process rights, and the rights of free speech, the press and religious practice. This was the birth of the United States of America. French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) French Revolution The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799 that profoundly affected French and modern history, marking the decline of powerful monarchies and churches and the rise of democracy and nationalism. Popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and aristocracy grew amidst an economic crisis following two expensive wars and years of bad harvests, motivating demands for change. These were couched in terms of Enlightenment ideals and caused the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789. Haitian Revolution (1791‚Äì1804) The Haitian Revolution The Haitian Revolution was a Slave rebellion slave revolt in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which culminated in the elimination of slavery there and the founding of the Republic of Haiti. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave revolt which led to the founding of a state. Furthermore, it is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred and as a defining moment in the histories of both Europe and the Americas. The rebellion began with a revolt of black African slaves in August 1791. It ended in November 1803 with the French defeat at the Battle of Verti√®res. Haiti became an independent country on January 1, 1804. One-third of French overseas trade and revenue came from Haitian sugar and coffee plantations. During the French Revolution the island was ignored, allowing the revolt to have some initial successes. However, after Napoleon became the first consul of France, he sent troops to suppress the revolt. The war was known for cruelty on both sides, and extensive guerrilla warfare. French forces showed no mercy, as they were fighting blacks, who were not considered to be worthy opponents of the French army. The French army suffered from severe outbreaks of disease, and the Haitians were under-equipped. Top leaders of both sides were killed, and the leader of the Haitians died in captivity. United Irishmen's Rebellion (1798) Irish Rebellion In 1798, Irishmen rose against British rule in Ireland in the hopes of creating a Republic. The rebellion was initiated by the Society of United Irishmen and led by Theobald Wolfe Tone. They rebelled against the government for a number of reasons but most notably due to the sectarian nature of British Rule, which upheld the Penal Laws that discriminated against Catholics and Presbyterians in Irish society. The rebellion failed and led to the Act of Union in 1801.  Serbian Revolution (1804‚Äì1835)  The Serbian Revolution was a national uprising and constitutional change in Serbia that took place between 1804 and 1835, during which the territory evolved from an Ottoman province into a rebel territory, a constitutional monarchy, and finally the modern Serbian state. The first part of the period, from 1804 to 1815, was marked by a violent struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire with two armed uprisings taking place, ending with a ceasefire. During the later period (1815‚Äì1835) a peaceful consolidation of political power developed in the increasingly autonomous Serbia, culminating in the recognition of the right to hereditary rule by Serbian princes in 1830 and 1833 and the territorial expansion of the young monarchy. The adoption of the first written Constitution in 1835 abolished feudalism and serfdom, and made the country suzerain. The term \\"Serbian Revolution\\" was coined by a German academic historiographer, Leopold von Ranke, in his book Die Serbische Revolution, published in 1829. These events marked the foundation of the modern Principality of Serbia. Scholars have characterized the Serbian War of Independence and subsequent national liberation as a revolution because the uprisings were started by broad masses of rural Serbian people who were in severe class conflict with the Turkish landowners as a political and economic masters at the same time, similar to Greece in 1821‚Äì1832. Latin American Wars of Independence (1808‚Äì1833) Latin America experienced independence revolutions in the early 19th century that separated the colonies from Spain and Portugal, creating new nations. These movements were generally led by the ethnically Spanish but locally born Creole class; these were often wealthy citizens that held high positions of power but were still poorly respected by the European-born Spaniards. One such Creole was Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who led several revolutions throughout South America and helped establish Gran Colombia. Another important figure was Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who helped create the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata and became the first president of Peru. Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1832) Greece in the early part of the 1800s was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. A series of revolts, starting in 1821, began the conflict. The Ottoman Empire sent in forces to suppress the revolts. By 1827, forces from Russia, Great Britain, and France entered the conflict, helping the Greeks drive the Turkish forces off the Peloponnese Peninsula. The Turks finally recognized Greece as a free nation in May 1832. Revolutions of 1820 The Revolutions of 1820 were a series of revolutionary uprisings in Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Greece. Unlike the wars of 1830, these wars tended to be in the outer regions of Europe. Revolutions of 1830 A revolutionary wave in Europe which took place in 1830. It included two \\"romantic nationalist\\" revolutions, the Belgian Revolution in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the July Revolution in France. There also were revolutions in Congress Poland, Italian states, Portugal and Switzerland. It was followed eighteen years later, by another and much stronger wave of revolutions known as the Revolutions of 1848.Clive H. Church, \\"Forgotten Revolutions: recent work on the revolutions of 1830 in Europe.\\" European Studies Review 7.1 (1977): 95-106.Clive H. Church, Europe in 1830: Revolution and political change (1983) Revolutions of 1848 The European Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Spring of Nations, Springtime of the Peoples or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history, but within a year, reactionary forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed. The political impact of the 1848 revolutions was more evident in Austria in comparison to the revolution's effects in countries like Germany. This is attributed to the way the upheavals in Vienna resulted in greater loss of life and gained stronger support from intellectuals, students, and the working class. An account described the German experience as less concerned with national issues, although it succeeded in breaking down class barriers. There was a previously prevalent view that there was only one revolutionary event in Germany but recent scholarship pointed to a fragmented picture of several revolutions happening at the same time. The 1848 revolutions were also notable because of the increased participation of women. While women rarely participated in revolutionary activities, there were those who performed supportive and auxiliary roles such as the cases of the women's political club in Vienna, which demanded revolutionary measures from the Austrian Constituent Assembly, and the Parisian women who protested and proposed their own solutions to social problems, particularly those involving their rights and crafts. Eureka Rebellion (1854) The Eureka Rebellion was a 20-minute shootout between the Miners of Ballarat, Victoria, against the British Redcoats. After the imposition of Gold Mining Licences, that being that a person had one of these to mine gold, and which cost 30 shillings a month to own a license, the miners decided that it was too much. So the Ballarat Miners started rallies at Bakery Hill and burnt their licenses, took an oath under the flag of the Southern Cross, elected Peter Lalor as their rebellion leader, and built a stockade (a makeshift fort) around the diggings. Eventually, the Redcoats led by Governor Hotham of Ballarat fired upon the stockade. The miners fired back and lasted 20 minutes before being overthrown by the Redcoats. Most of the miners were arrested by the British, and taken to trial. If found guilty, they would hang for high treason. All were eventually acquitted. Even though it lasted only 20 minutes, it was the beginning of democracy for all Australians. Taiping Revolution (1850‚Äì1864) The Taiping Rebellion which lasted from 1850 to 1864, was a revolt that was waged against the Qing dynasty in China, and its main causes were religious convictions rather than regional economic conditions. The Taiping forces were led by a cult-like group that was called the God Worshipping Society by its self-proclaimed prophet Hong Xiuquan, and in 1853, they seized the city of Nanjing and occupied it as their kingdom's capital city for a decade. However, the Taiping forces failed to overthrow the Qing dynasty, and when their rebellion was finally crushed in 1864, more than 20 million people were dead.

He is a former professional rugby league footballer. He is best known as a coach for his Challenge Cup successes with Sheffield Eagles in 1998 and Hull in 2005, as well as his time coaching Wakefield Trinity in the late 2000s. As a player, he played on the or in the position for Castleford. Background Kear was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Playing career =County Cup Final appearances= John Kear played as a , i.e. number 5, in Castleford's 2‚Äì13 defeat by Hull in the 1983 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1983‚Äì84 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 15 October 1983. Coaching career =Early career= After stints working as a conditioner for Castleford, as head coach of Bramley (1992), working in the player performance department of the Rugby Football League, head coach of Paris Saint-Germain, and assistant coach to both England and Great Britain, he took over the coaching reins at Sheffield Eagles in 1997, taking them to the Premiership semi-final in that year. A year later he was the coach who led Sheffield Eagles to a Challenge Cup final victory over the Wigan Warriors; this triumph has been described as one of the greatest shocks in Challenge Cup history. Sheffield Eagles merged with the Huddersfield Giants after 1999's Super League IV, and Kear retained his job as coach of the merged side before moving on to become the assistant coach to Stuart Raper at the Wigan Warriors. He was coach of the England team in the 2000 World Cup, leading them to the semi-finals. =Later career= He left Wigan for the first team coach role at Hull, working with Shaun McRae. He stepped up to first team coach at Hull in 2005 when predecessor Shaun McRae left to take charge of South Sydney Rabbitohs. He led the club to victory over Leeds, by a 25‚Äì24 scoreline in the 2005 Challenge Cup in his first season. However, in April 2006 he was sacked by Hull. 300px He took charge of Wakefield Trinity in July 2006 where he steered the team clear of relegation with four wins from the last six matches of the season, culminating in the great escape and condemning Castleford to relegation to National League One. In 2007 he fielded a predominantly untried squad and led Trinity to 8th position in the Super League, their second highest Super League finish. In 2009 Kear led Wakefield Trinity to 5th position, their highest ever Super League finish. The team were knocked out of the first round of the play-offs by Catalans Dragons. In 2011 Kear left Wakefield Trinity to become head coach of Batley. On 16 July 2014 Kear succeeded Iestyn Harris as head coach of Wales, a role he undertook alongside his position at Batley and subsequently at Bradford Bulls. His first game was against Scotland in the 2014 European Cup. He lost the opening game by a score of 42‚Äì18 in horrible weather conditions. After a horrible 2014 European Cup event, his more 'strengthened' Welsh team took on Scotland again in the opening match of the 2015 Tournament. John's team earned their first ever victory after a spree of 12 consecutive defeats which began back in 2011. Wales went on to be unbeaten in the tournament resulting in them winning their first European Cup tournament since 2010. The following year, he was required to make Wales qualify for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup via the European qualifiers. In the opening game at Llanelli, Wales thrashed Serbia by 50 points. He coached the Wales 9s squad at the 2019 Rugby League World Cup 9s.

While his paternal ancestry is uncertain, his descendants held the Earldom of Dunbar, later known as the Earldom of March, in south-east Scotland until 1435. Background Gospatric was a great- grandson of √Üthelred II through his mother, Ealdgyth, and his maternal grandmother, √Ülfgifu, who had married Uchtred the Bold.Anderson, A.O. (1990) Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286, Vol. 2 Paul Watkins Medieval StudiesAnderson, A.O. (1991) Scottish annals from Early chroniclers A.D. 500 to 1286 Paul Watkins Medieval Studies, pg 81 =Issue about paternal lineage= He is often said to have been a son of Maldred son of Cr√≠n√°n of Dunkeld.Thus Fletcher, p. 76, table 3; Anderson, Alan O., MA Edin., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 to 1286, London, 1908, p.96, citing Symeon of Durham, refers to \\"Gospatric, son of Maldred, Crinan's son\\", also pp 80‚Äì81, again citing Symeon, refer to the marriage of Aldgitha daughter of earl Uhtred to \\"Maldred, son of Crinan the thane\\". That \\"Crinan the thane\\", father of Maldred, and Cr√≠n√°n, father of King Donnchad, are one and the same person is by no means clear. It has been suggested that Maldred might not be the son of Cr√≠n√°n's known wife Beth√≥c, daughter of the Scots king Malcolm II, as Gospatric's descendants made no such claim when they submitted their pleadings in the Great Cause, however his direct descendant, Patrick, 7th Earl of Dunbar, did indeed make a claim to the throne during these pleadings to determine the succession to the kingship of the Scots after the death of Alexander III in 1286. Duncan, pp. 348‚Äì349, table C. Alternatively, rather than being descended from a half-brother of King Duncan I (Donnchad mac Cr√≠n√°in), Gospatric may have been the youngest son of Earl Uhtred the Bold (died 1016). Another reconstruction would make Gospatric the grandson of Uhtred's discarded first wife, Ecgfritha, daughter of Aldhun, Bishop of Durham, through Sigrida, her daughter with Kilvert, son of Ligulf.Forte et al., p. 204. Whatever his parentage may have been, Gospatric was clearly an important figure in Northumbria and Cumbria, with ties to the family of Earl Uchtred. The Life of Edward the Confessor, commissioned by Queen Edith, contains an account of the pilgrimage to Rome of Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria. It tells how a band of robbers attacked Tostig's party in Italy, seeking to kidnap the Earl. A certain Gospatric \\"was believed because of the luxury of his clothes and his physical appearance, which was indeed distinguished\\" to be Earl Tostig, and succeeded in deceiving the would-be kidnappers as to his identity until the real Earl was safely away from the scene. Whether this was the same Gospatric, or a kinsman of the same name, is unclear, but it is suggested that his presence in Tostig's party was as a hostage as much as a guest.Fletcher, pp. 152‚Äì154. Harrying of the North After his victory over Harold Godwinson at Hastings, William of Normandy appointed a certain Copsi or Copsig, a supporter of the late Earl Tostig, who had been exiled with his master in 1065, as Earl of Bernicia in the spring of 1067. Copsi was dead within five weeks, killed by Oswulf, grandson of Uchtred, who installed himself as Earl. Oswulf was killed in the autumn by bandits after less than six months as Earl.Fletcher, pp. 169‚Äì171; Higham, p. 242; Stenton, pp. 601‚Äì602. At this point, Gospatric, who had a plausible claim to the Earldom given the likelihood that he was related to Oswulf and Uchtred, offered King William a large amount of money to be given the Earldom of Bernicia. The King, who was in the process of raising heavy taxes, accepted.Fletcher, p. 171, In early 1068, a series of uprisings in England, along with foreign invasion, faced King William with a dire threat. Gospatric is found among the leaders of the uprising, along with Edgar √Ütheling and Edwin, Earl of Mercia and his brother Morcar. This uprising soon collapsed, and William proceeded to dispossess many of the northern landowners and grant the lands to Norman incomers. For Gospatric, this meant the loss of his earldom to Robert Comine and exile in Scotland. King William's authority, apart from minor local troubles such as Hereward the Wake and Eadric the Wild, appeared to extend securely across England.Fletcher, pp 171‚Äì173; Higham, pp. 241‚Äì242; Stenton, p. 601. Gospatric joined the invading army of Danes, Scots, and Englishmen under Edgar the Aetheling in the next year. Though the army was defeated, he afterwards was able, from his possession of Bamburgh castle, to make terms with the conqueror, who left him undisturbed till 1072. The widespread destruction in Northumbria known as the Harrying of the North relates to this period. Exile In 1072 William the Conqueror stripped Gospatric of his Earldom of Northumbria,Anderson, Alan O., MA Edin., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 to 1286, London, 1908, p.96 and he replaced him with Siward's son Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northampton. Gospatric fled into exile in Scotland and not long afterwards went to Flanders. When he returned to Scotland he was granted the castle at \\"Dunbar and lands adjacent to it\\" and in the Merse by King Malcolm Canmore.Anderson, Alan O., MA Edin., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 to 1286, London, 1908, p.96, citing Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum, vol.ii, p.199 This earldom without a name in the Scots-controlled northern part of Bernicia would later become the Earldom of Dunbar. Gospatric did not long survive in exile according to Roger of Hoveden's chronicle: > [N]ot long after this, being reduced to extreme infirmity, he sent for > Aldwin and Turgot, the monks, who at this time were living at Meilros, in > poverty and contrite in spirit for the sake of Christ, and ended his life > with a full confession of his sins, and great lamentations and penitence, at > Ubbanford, which is also called Northam, and was buried in the porch of the > church there. He was the father of three sons, and at least one daughter named Uchtreda, who married Duncan II of Scotland, the son of King Malcolm Canmore. The sons were:, * Gospatric who was killed at the battle of the Standard in 1138. * Dolfin, who seems to have received from Malcolm the government of Carlisle. Dolfin has also been identified with Dolfin de Bradeley and is believed to be the progenitor of the Bradley, Staveley, De Hebden, and Thoresby families. * Waltheof, Lord of Allerdale and Abbot of Crowland Fiction *Under the alternative spelling Cospatrick, he appears as a major character in Nigel Tranter's 1979 historical novel Margaret the Queen. *Gospatric is one of the central characters of the novel Warriors of the Dragon Gold by Ray Bryant.

Investors frequently use the index as a stand-in for measuring the performance of the US bond market. In addition to investment grade corporate debt, the index tracks government debt, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) to simulate the universe of investable bonds that meet certain criteria. In order to be included in the Agg, bonds must be of investment grade or higher, have an outstanding par value of at least $100 million and have at least one year until maturity. Index funds and exchange-traded funds are available that track this bond index. The index has been maintained by Bloomberg L.P. since August 24, 2016. Prior to then it was known as the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index and was maintained by Barclays. Prior to November 3, 2008 it was known as the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index and maintained by the now defunct Lehman Brothers. History The precursors to the Agg was co-created on July 7, 1973 by Art Lipson and John Roundtree, both of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., a boutique investment bank. Lipson and Roundtree created two total-return indexes focused on US bonds: the US Government and the US Investment Grade Corporate Indexes. The indexes were blended in 1979 to form the Government/Credit Index. In 1986, mortgage backed securities were also added to the index, which was renamed the US Aggregate Index and was backfilled with historical data to 1976. It was later renamed the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The index was acquired by Bloomberg L.P. in August 2016 as part of a larger sale of the bank's index and risk analytics business. The index was subsequently renamed the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. Upon its acquisition, Bloomberg and Barclays announced that the index would be co-branded for an initial term of five years. Index characteristics The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a market capitalization-weighted index, meaning the securities in the index are weighted according to the market size of each bond type. Most U.S. traded investment grade bonds are represented. Municipal bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are excluded, due to tax treatment issues. The index includes Treasury securities, Government agency bonds, Mortgage-backed bonds, Corporate bonds, and a small amount of foreign bonds traded in U.S. The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is an intermediate term index. The average maturity as of December 31, 2009 was 4.57 years. Investing Many index funds and exchange-traded funds attempt to replicate (before fees and expenses) the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. Some examples of such funds include iShares Core US Aggregate Bond Index (AGG), Thrift Savings Plan (F Fund) Fixed Income Index fund, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBMFX), and Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund (FXNAX). Fund managers sometimes subdivide the different parts of the Aggregate by maturity or sector for managing individual portfolios. The Municipal section of the index is the only part of the index that cannot be used for this purpose - because municipal debt is issued by so many different entities, the Municipals in the Aggregate are only intended to be representative, and Bloomberg maintains separate indices for maintaining Municipal-only portfolios.  Criticism  Some investors have criticized the use of the Agg as a representation of the performance of the entire US fixed income universe. Because the benchmark was founded in the 1970s, and some of its data dates back to only 1986, a time when interest rates began to decline from all-time highs, the index has only seen a few years of negative returns. Additionally, approximately one-third of the Agg is US Treasuries, which exposes the index to US monetary policy. The exclusion of high yield, foreign-denominated and municipal bonds, as well as certain mortgage backed securities also limits the index.

In the 1880s and 1890s it was a bustling mining town of 3,000 residents, and was the center of gold mining in Montana. The town was named by Thomas Cruse, mine owner, to honor Mary Ralston the wife of a miner. A few buildings remain, including a baseball field with bleachers. The population as of the 2010 census was 80. Geography Marysville is in southwestern Lewis and Clark County, by road northwest of Helena, the state capital. It is in the valley of Silver Creek, which flows east into the Helena Valley and joins the Missouri River. West of the town is the Great Divide Ski Area on the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Belmont, while down the road to the east is the Silver City Saloon on Highway 279.

Watkins (c. 1884-1890) In 2010, there were news reports stating that recent exploration of the richest gold mine in the area, the Drumlummon Mine, had led to possible new discoveries. Its lower levels were allowed to flood when the mine was closed in 1904 during litigation. Sentiment in the town is mixed regarding possible resumption of extensive mining operations.\\"As a Near Ghost Town in Montana Watches, a Gold Mine Is Reborn\\" article by Kirk Johnson in The New York Times April 30, 2010 Lore Much of the lore in Marysville was centered on one Irishman, \\"Irish Tommy\\" Cruise. He came to the area to look for gold but would return with an empty poke and a smile. He didn't have much money and often slept in a bar counter in Helena. One day, in a site near present-day Marysville, he hit it rich. He named the site Drumlummon, after his birthplace in Ireland, and founded Marysville. Some believe it was named so because the first person there was a Mary Ralston. Others believed it was for the first three Marys there. Another said it was after one of Tommy's associates. Tommy got $150,000 before selling it for $1,500,000.

It is situated 5.5 (8.8 km) miles east of Bedworth (the closest town), 6.5 miles (10.5 km) southwest of Nuneaton and an equal distance northwest of Coventry. History In medieval times there were two castles. These might not have existed at the same time and neither survived into the 16th century. The earliest was a ring earthwork of King Stephen's time. The second was probably a fortified manor house, held by the de Hastings family. Henry de Hastings (c.1235‚Äìc.1268) was Constable of Kenilworth Castle in 1265-1266 for Simon de Montford during the latter's conflict with King Henry III.

It was constructed circa 1730 and in the late nineteenth century was a boarding house and the center of the Cos Cob Art Colony, Connecticut's first art colony. From 1890 to 1920, the house was a gathering place for artists, writers and editors, and scores of art students came to study with leading American Impressionists John Henry Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, Theodore Robinson, and Childe Hassam. It is currently operated as a historic site by the Historical Society of the Town of Greenwich, and is open for tours.  History of the Bush and Holley families  Front porch = The Bushes = Bush‚ÄìHolley House was built in stages beginning 1728‚Äì1730, with a one-room, two-story structure on a hilltop overlooking the harbor; the main \\"salt box\\" house was completed a few years later. In 1738, Justus Bush (originally Bosch), a Dutch Greenwich farmer, purchased the house but did not occupy it. His son David Bush (b. 1733) inherited the house and from 1755 to 1777, made significant changes to it, including joining the two buildings to create an entrance hall, adding wood panelling to the parlor and parlor chamber, and attaching an outbuilding to create the \\"back kitchen\\" wing. In 1777 a widowed David Bush married his sister-in-law, Sarah Scudder Isaacs (b. 1742), adding five of her six children to his five, and fathering five more before his death in 1797. His household also included 10 enslaved adults and children, making him the largest slave-owner in town. David Bush's son, Justus Luke Bush, inherited the home and bought out his brother Ralph Isaac Bush's share of his father's estate. = The Holleys and MacRaes = The Bush‚ÄìHolley House passed out of the Bush family in 1848 into the hands of Josephine and Edward Holley. The Holleys added new windows and a second-story porch, and in 1882 began operating it as a place of lodging for visiting artists and writers. In the summer of 1896, Elmer Livingston MacRae visited Cos Cob for a class in outdoor painting. While there, he fell in love with Emma Constant Holley, daughter of Josephine and Edward. MacRae moved into the house full-time in 1899, and married Emma on October 17, 1900. She gave birth to twin girls, Constant and Clarissa, on October 31, 1904. MacRae succeeded John Henry Twachtman as head of the Cos Cob Art Colony, and for two decades Elmer and Emma continued to run the boardinghouse, which also served as a studio and showcase for MacRae's works.  Bush‚ÄìHolley Historic Site  The Historical Society of the Town of Greenwich purchased the house in 1957 from the widowed Constant Holley MacRae and first opened it as a museum in 1958. The main house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. and Guided tours of Bush‚ÄìHolley House feature historic interiors related to the Bush and Holley families and an American Impressionist art collection.

The Wortham Theater Center, designed by Eugene Aubry of Morris Architects, was built out of private funds totaling over $66 Million. The City of Houston owns the building, and the Houston First Corporation operates the facility. History The Wortham Theater Center officially launched on May 9, 1987. The inaugural performance, Tango Argentino, was performed in the Brown Theatre. The Knee Plays, written by Robert Wilson and lead singer David Byrne of The Talking Heads, was presented by the Society for the Performing Arts in the Cullen Theater. In 2017 it was damaged by Hurricane Harvey; it reopened in September 2018. Significant Private Funding A significant portion of the funding needed to build the center came from the estate of the late Gus Wortham (1891‚Äì1976), a local philanthropist and founder of American General Insurance Company. The Wortham Foundation contributed $20 million to the construction of the new Theater Center, which was named after Wortham. In spite of the banking and oil recession of the late 1980s, more than 3,500 donors committed funds for the new facility in a major community effort, with nearly 2,200 individuals donating $100 or less to the capital campaign. Additionally, the Cullen Foundation contributed $7.5 million, and the Brown Foundation gave $6 million to the building fund. Performance facilities * The Brown Theater, with 2,405 seats, is named for donors Alice and George Brown. It is used primarily for opera and large ballet productions by two resident companies: the Houston Ballet and the Houston Grand Opera. * The Cullen Theater, with 1,100 seats, is named for donors Lillie and Roy Cullen. It is used for smaller productions and other events. Additional Facts The Houston Ballet began its residency at the center on September 2, 1987, with Janie Parker and Li Cunxin starring in the world premiere of Ben Stevenson's production of Romeo and Juliet. This was followed by Houston Grand Opera's first season, on October 15, 1987, with Pl√°cido Domingo and Mirella Freni in a production of Verdi's Aida. The glass entry archway, 88-feet (27-m) tall, was originally designedThe Houston Chronicle (newspaper), archives, 1987. to be the end of a glass atrium, but the atrium concept was considered incompatible with Houston's hot summer weather and the danger of hurricanes, so the atrium was omitted during construction. There had been a debate about how to re-design the entry section as a non-atrium structure, but the decision was to leave the connecting archway, as designed, and simply enclose it with glass. In the future, the archway could easily be extended, if an entry structure is added. The Helen Hayes Chandelier, hanging in the Green Room, was originally installed in 1911 at New York City's Fulton Theater (renamed as Helen Hayes Theatre in 1955). During the demolition of that theater, the chandelier was purchased by Houstonians Billy and Janie Lisa Price, who donated it to Wortham Center. The grand staircase, which is actually a bank of escalators, is surrounded by a site-specific illuminated installation by renowned New York sculptor Albert Paley. To avoid extensive last-minute debates about approving the sculpture by the artwork committee, the illuminated structure was categorized as an issue of lighting/electrical design, not subject to the artwork committee's oversight. A unique acoustic feature of the theater is its \\"frying pan\\" pods, accessible via walkways over the rear of the orchestra seating. This construction enables the music to flow between these pods and into sections of the opera hall that is traditionally not considered a good listening area. 2017 Hurricane Damage The center was damaged by a flood caused by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. While the structure was undamaged, the storm and its aftermath left of water, dirt, and debris in the lower levels of the center. Management determined that repairs to the facility would take until at least September 2018. Water breached the backstage door and other locations, filling the entire basement with 12 feet of water which destroyed mechanical equipment, electrical gear, and other building systems located in the basement level. Water also filled the orchestra pits which were also in the basement. There was water damage to the stage flooring and other finishes on the ground level. A team including Turner Construction, HKA/ARUP, and Manhattan Construction led the restoration of the theater and rehearsal spaces to its original glory. Jaffe Holden Acoustics provided acoustic and audio/video systems design services in eight short months to ensure the curtain could open in time for the fall 2018 Opera season.jaffeholden.com/ References External links * Official Website of the Wortham Theater Center * Houston Grand Opera's website * Houston Ballet's website * Albert Paley Official Website Category:Performing arts centers in Texas Category:Opera houses in Texas Category:Theatres in Houston Category:Theatres completed in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Texas Category:Downtown Houston ","title":"Wortham Theater Center"},{"id":"3661703","text":"Revel Ronald Cooper (c. 1934 ‚Äì 1983) was an Indigenous Australian artist. He was a prominent member of a Noongar art movement that emerged among children living at Carrolup Native Settlement during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Early life Cooper was born in Katanning, Western Australia in the mid-1930s and as a ward of the state was placed at Carrolup Native Settlement. Children of Carrolup From the 1940s children at the Carrolup school were given specialised art training. Cooper was one of a number of children collectively referred to as the Children of Carrolup. During the late 1940s artwork created by the Carrolup children was exhibited in the Western Australian capital Perth and overseas in India. Through the intervention of English woman Florence Rutter, the paintings were exhibited in New Zealand and in Europe. In 1952 his work appeared in Mary Durack's book Child Artists of the Australian Bush. Later art Unlike many of the child artists of Carrolup, Cooper continued painting into adulthood. After leaving school in 1951 he was briefly engaged as a commercial artist in Perth before moving back to Carrolup to work as a farm worker and railway fettler. In 1952 Cooper was tried for the murder of Jimmy Dee Long near Narrogin, but the jury was discharged after failing to reach a verdict. Later that year he was tried and found guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter. The jury strongly recommended mercy, and the judge told Cooper that alcohol \\"is the source of your trouble\\" and sentenced him to four years imprisonment. This was the first of a string of jail terms. In the mid 1950s he had a brief stint in Victoria working for Bill Onus' Aboriginal souvenir business and is considered to have influenced the artistic style of Bill's son, Lin Onus. A black and white scan of the cover of Mary Durack's 1976 children's novel Yagan of the Bibbulmun, with illustrations by Revel Cooper. During the 1960s with assistance from the Victorian Aborigines Advancement League Cooper was a frequent exhibitor in Victorian galleries. His use of landscapes had by this stage become his signature style. In 1968 Cooper wrote an article \\"To Regain Our Pride\\", for the Aboriginal Quarterly. Writing from prison in Geelong, he described his childhood dreams and later disillusionment. During a stint in Fremantle Prison in 1976 he was the illustrator of Mary Durack's Yagan of the Bibbulmun, a work of juvenile fiction. While at Fremantle he also painted twelve works depicting the Stations of the Cross (now lost) for the restoration of the Sacred Heart Church in Mount Barker. He served as a teacher for a group of artists at Fremantle Prison including Goldie Kelly and Swag Taylor. For a time he also worked as chauffeur to the Director of Aboriginal Welfare in Melbourne.

Early currents of libertarian Marxism such as left communism emerged in opposition to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism.Herman Gorter, Anton Pannekoek, Sylvia Pankhurst, Otto Ruhl Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils. Red and Black, 2007. Libertarian Marxism is often critical of reformist positions such as those held by social democrats. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' later works, specifically the Grundrisse and The Civil War in France;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007. emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a state or vanguard party to mediate or aid its liberation.Draper, Hal. Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels\\" \\"The Socialist Register.\\" Vol 4. Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism.Chomsky, Noam. \\"Government In The Future\\" Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture. Libertarian Marxism includes currents such as autonomism, council communism, De Leonism, Lettrism, parts of the New Left, Situationism, Socialisme ou Barbarie and workerism. Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both post-left and social anarchists. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Maurice Brinton, Cornelius Castoriadis, Guy Debord, Raya Dunayevskaya, Daniel Gu√©rin, C. L. R. James, Rosa Luxemburg, Antonio Negri, Anton Pannekoek, Fredy Perlman, Ernesto Screpanti, E. P. Thompson, Raoul Vaneigem and Yanis Varoufakis, who claims that Marx himself was a libertarian Marxist.  Overview  Marxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. According to Chamsy Ojelli, \\"[o]ne does find early expressions of such perspectives in Morris and the Socialist Party of Great Britain (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism\\".\\"The 'Advance Without Authority': Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals\\" by Chamsy Ojeili, Democracy & Nature vol.7, no.3, 2001. In December 1884, William Morris established the Socialist League which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and Eleanor Marx. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners as well as in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber Marxists in the Socialist League.Beer, A History of British Socialism, vol. 2, pg. 256. The 3rd Annual Conference of the League held in London on 29 May 1887 marked the change, with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: \\"This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it\\".Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48. New York: International Publishers, 2001; pg. 538, fn. 95. Morris played peacemaker, but he ultimately sided with the anti-parliamentarians, who won control of the Socialist League which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner Edward Aveling to form the separate Bloomsbury Socialist Society. = Theory = For \\"many Marxian libertarian socialists, the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The Bordigists and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return 'behind Marx' to the anti- positivist programme of German idealism. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy. [...] Karl Korsch [...] remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes\\". In rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian socialists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist representative democracy and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as autonomism and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time as in the Spanish Civil War, although as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninists, Marxist‚ÄìLeninists and their derivatives such as Maoists on the other. However, in recent history libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with Marxist‚ÄìLeninist groups in order to protest institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the International Workingmen's Association, the First International, a congress of radical workers, where Mikhail Bakunin (who was fairly representative of anarchist views) and Karl Marx (whom anarchists accused of being an \\"authoritarian\\") came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of electoral politics was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call \\"authoritarian communists\\", or alternatively just \\"authoritarians\\". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble syndicalism and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist Anton Pannekoek. In Chomsky's Notes on Anarchism,Noam Chomsky Notes on Anarchism he suggests the possibility \\"that some form of council communism is the natural form of revolutionary socialism in an industrial society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a 'vanguard' party, or a State bureaucracy\\".  History  = 20th century = According to Chamsy el- Ojeili, \\"the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses\\". For these socialists, \\"[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius\\". Luxemburg's workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period. [...] Pannekoek, Roland Holst and Gorter in the Netherlands, Sylvia Pankhurst in Britain, Gramsci in Italy and Lukacs in Hungary. In these formulations, the dictatorship of the proletariat was to be the dictatorship of a class, \\"not of a party or of a clique\\". However, within this line of thought \\"[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity. [...] The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and Lukacs. [...] The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form\\". In the emerging Soviet state, there appeared left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks which were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks led or supported by left wing groups including Socialist Revolutionaries,Carr, E.H. ‚Äì The Bolshevik Revolution 1917‚Äì1923. W. W. Norton & Company 1985. Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and anarchists.Avrich, Paul. \\"Russian Anarchists and the Civil War\\", Russian Review, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296‚Äì306. Blackwell Publishing Some were in support of the White Movement while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the Russian Civil War and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. The POUM is viewed as being libertarian Marxist due to its anti-Soviet stance in the Civil War in Spain. = Post-World War II = Cornelius Castoriadis, theorist of the group Socialisme ou Barbarie In the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with Trotskyism which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group Socialisme ou Barbarie emerged from the Trotskyist Fourth International, where Castoriadis and Claude Lefort constituted a Chaulieu‚ÄìMontal Tendency in the French Parti Communiste Internationaliste in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \\"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\\",, p. 133 leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \\"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German 'left' of the 1920s\\"., p. 134 In the United Kingdom, the group Solidarity was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League. Almost from the start, it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was Chris Pallis (who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton).Brinton, Maurice (Goodway, David ed). For Workers' Power: the selected writings of Maurice Brinton. AK Press. 2004. In the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1967, the terms ultra-left and left communist refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further left than that of the central Maoist leaders at the height of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (GPCR). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century Chinese anarchist orientations. As a slur, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has used the term \\"ultra-left\\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further left than the party line. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC Central Committee denounced as ultra-left the line of Mao Zedong from 1956 until his death in 1976. Ultra- left refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an antagonistic contradiction between the CPC-PRC party-state itself and the masses of workers and peasants\\"Peasant (ÂÜúÊ∞ë)\\" was the official term for workers on people's communes. According to the ultra- left, both peasants and urban workers together composed a proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however \\"red\\" a given bureaucrat's thought might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary \\"ideas\\" and \\"habits\\" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \\"turn over a new leaf\\" after they had undergone \\"thought reform\\", the ultra-left argued that cultural revolution had to give way to political revolution \\"in which one class overthrows another class\\".See, for instance, \\"Whither China?\\" by Yang Xiguang.The 70s Collective, ed. 1996. China: The Revolution is Dead, Long Live the Revolution. Montreal: Black Rose Books. The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism.Robin Hahnel, Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation Part II The New Left's critique of the Old Left's authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in personal liberty, autonomy (see the thinking of Cornelius Castoriadis) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as left communism, council communism and the Industrial Workers of the World. The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like Radical America and Black Mask in the United States, Solidarity, Big Flame and Democracy & Nature, succeeded by The International Journal of Inclusive DemocracyThe International Journal of Inclusive Democracy. Inclusivedemocracy.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28. in the United Kingdom, introduced a range of left libertarian ideas to a new generation. In 1969, French platformist anarcho-communist Daniel Gu√©rin published an essay called \\"Libertarian Marxism?\\" in which he dealt with the debate between Marx and Bakunin at the First International and afterwards suggested that \\"[l]ibertarian marxism [sic] rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far- seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian marxism [sic] thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown\\". Autonomist Marxism, neo-Marxism and situationist theory are also regarded as being anti-authoritarian variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition. Related to this were intellectuals who were influenced by Italian left communist Amadeo Bordiga, but who disagreed with his Leninist positions, including Jacques Camatte, editor of the French publication Invariance; and Gilles Dauve, who published Troploin with Karl Nesic.  Notable libertarian Marxist tendencies  First English edition of Vladimir Lenin's \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder (published by the Executive Committee of the Communist International for delegates to its 2nd World Congress)Charles Shipman, It Had to Be Revolution: Memoirs of an American Radical. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993; pg. 107. in which Lenin attacks left communists and council communists = De Leonism = De Leonism, occasionally known as Marxism‚ÄìDe Leonism, is a form of syndicalist Marxism developed by Daniel De Leon. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the Socialist Labor Party of America. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with orthodox Marxism. According to De Leonist theory, militant industrial unions are the vehicle of class struggle. Industrial unions serving the interests of the proletariat will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that‚Äîaccording to De Leonist thinking‚Äîa revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the Socialist Labor Party. Leninism and its vanguard party idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's What Is To Be Done?. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other \\"communist\\" states. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. = Council communism = Anton Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism Council communism was a radical left movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, is that workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of working class organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and Bolshevik stress on vanguard parties, parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by workers' councils, composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run \\"bureaucratic socialism\\". They also oppose the idea of a \\"revolutionary party\\", since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils. The Russian word for council is soviet and during the early years of the revolution workers' councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the aura of workplace power that the word became used by Lenin for various political organs. Indeed, the name Supreme Soviet, which the parliament was called and that of the Soviet Union itself, make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a bourgeois revolution when a party bureaucracy replaced the old feudal aristocracy. Although most felt the Russian Revolution was working class in character, they believed that because capitalist relations still existed (i.e. the workers had no say in running the economy) the Soviet Union ended up as a state capitalist country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Thus council communists support workers' revolutions, but oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of agitation and propaganda, rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions to form one big, revolutionary union. = Left communism = Left communism describes the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first and during its second congress. Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, Rosa Luxemburg has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, Herman Gorter, Anton Pannekoek, Otto R√ºhle, Karl Korsch, Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick. Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Current and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations. = Within Freudo-Marxism = Wilhelm Reich, Freudo-Marxist theorist who wrote the book The Sexual Revolution in 1936 Two Marxist and Freudian psychoanalytic theorists have received the libertarian label or have been associated with it due to their emphasis on anti-authoritarianism and freedom issues. Wilhelm Reich\\"Wilhelm Reich is again the main pioneer in this field (an excellent, short introduction to his ideas can be found in Maurice Brinton's The Irrational in Politics). In Children of the Future, Reich made numerous suggestions, based on his research and clinical experience, for parents, psychologists, and educators striving to develop libertarian methods of child rearing. (He did not use the term \\"libertarian,\\" but that is what his methods are.) Hence, in this and the following sections we will summarise Reich's main ideas as well as those of other libertarian psychologists and educators who have been influenced by him, such as A.S. Neill and Alexander Lowen.\\" \\"J.6 What methods of child rearing do anarchists advocate?\\" in An Anarchist FAQ by Various Authors.\\"In an earlier article (‚ÄúSome Thoughts on Libertarianism,‚Äù Broadsheet No. 35), I argued that to define a position as ‚Äúanti-authoritarian‚Äù is not, in fact, to define the position at all ‚Äúbut merely to indicate a relationship of opposition to another position, the authoritarian one...On the psychoanalytic side, Wilhelm Reich (The Sexual Revolution, Peter Neville-Vision Press, London, 1951 Character Analysis, Orgone Institute Press, N.Y., 1945; and The Function of the Orgasm, Orgone Institute Press, N.Y., 1942) was preferred to Freud because, despite his own weaknesses ‚Äì his Utopian tendencies and his eventual drift into ‚Äúorgones‚Äù and ‚Äúbions‚Äù ‚Äì Reich laid more emphasis on the social conditions of mental events than did Freud (see, e.g., A.J.

Here a division developed between a more radical wing (including e.g. Waters and Grahame Harrison) and a more conservative wing (including e.g. Stove and Eric Dowling). The general orientation of these meetings may be judged from the fact that when Harry Hooton proposed \\"Anarchist\\" and some of the conservative proposed \\"Democratic\\" as the name for the new Society, both were rejected and \\"Libertarian Society\\" was adopted as an acceptable title. Likewise then accepted as the motto for this Society - and continued by the later Libertarian society - was the early Marx quotation used by Wilhelm Reich as the motto for his The Sexual Revolution, vis: \\"Since it is not for us to create a plan for the future that will hold for all time, all the more surely what we contemporaries have to do is the uncompromising critical evaluation of all that exists, uncompromising in the sense that our criticism fears neither its own results nor the conflict with the powers that be.\\" \\"SYDNEY LIBERTARIANISM & THE PUSH\\" by A.J.

His work on character contributed to the development of Anna Freud's The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936) and his idea of muscular armour--the expression of the personality in the way the body moves-- shaped innovations such as body psychotherapy, Fritz Perls's Gestalt therapy, Alexander Lowen's bioenergetic analysis and Arthur Janov's primal therapy. His writing influenced generations of intellectuals‚Äîduring the 1968 student uprisings in Paris and Berlin, students scrawled his name on walls and threw copies of The Mass Psychology of Fascism at the police.For Anna Freud, see Bugental, Schneider and Pierson 2001, p. 14: \\"Anna Freud's work on the ego and the mechanisms of defense developed from Reich's early research (A.

On 23 August, six tons of his books, journals and papers were burned in the 25th Street public incinerator in New York, the Gansevoort incinerator. The burned material included copies of several of his books, including The Sexual Revolution, Character Analysis and The Mass Psychology of Fascism. Though these had been published in German before Reich ever discussed orgone, he had added mention of it to the English editions, so they were caught by the injunction.Sharaf 1994, pp. 419, pp. 460‚Äì461. As with the accumulators, the FDA was supposed only to observe the destruction. It has been cited as one of the worst examples of censorship in the United States. Reich became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom going as far as opening free sex- counselling clinics in Vienna for working-class patientsSex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Danto writes that Reich offered a mixture of \\"psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives,\\" and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help. Danto, Elizabeth Ann (2007).

Wolfe) Herbert Marcuse, associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory, was an influential libertarian socialist philosopher of the New LeftDouglas Kellner Herbert arcuse On the other hand, Herbert Marcuse was a German philosopher, sociologist and political theorist associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory. His work Eros and Civilization (1955) discusses the social meaning of biology‚Äîhistory seen not as a class struggle, but a fight against repression of our instincts. It argues that \\"advanced industrial society\\" (modern capitalism) is preventing us from reaching a non- repressive society \\"based on a fundamentally different experience of being, a fundamentally different relation between man and nature, and fundamentally different existential relations\\".Marcuse, Herbert. Eros and Civilization, 2nd edition. London: Routledge, 1987. It contends that Freud's argument that repression is needed by civilization to persist is mistaken as Eros is liberating and constructive. Marcuse argues that \\"the irreconcilable conflict is not between work (reality principle) and Eros (pleasure principle), but between alienated labour (performance principle) and Eros\\".Young, Robert M. (1969).THE NAKED MARX: Review of Herbert Marcuse, Eros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud, New Statesman, vol. 78, 7 November 1969, pp. 666-67 Sex is allowed for \\"the betters\\" (capitalists) and for workers only when not disturbing performance. Marcuse believes that a socialist society could be a society without needing the performance of the poor and without as strong a suppression of our sexual drives‚Äîit could replace alienated labor with \\"non-alienated libidinal work\\" resulting in \\"a non-repressive civilization based on 'non-repressive sublimation'\\". During the 1960s, Marcuse achieved world renown as \\"the guru of the New Left\\", publishing many articles and giving lectures and advice to student radicals all over the world. He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism.Douglas Kellner \\"Marcuse, Herbert\\" = Socialisme ou Barbarie = The journal Socialisme ou Barbarie Socialisme ou Barbarie (\\"Socialism or Barbarism\\") was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-World War II period, whose name comes from a phrase Rosa Luxemburg used in her 1916 essay The Junius Pamphlet. It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was Cornelius Castoriadis, also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan. The group originated in the Trotskyist Fourth International, where Castoriadis and Claude Lefort constituted a Chaulieu‚ÄìMontal Tendency in the French Parti Communiste Internationaliste in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their \\"final disenchantment with Trotskyism\\", leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that \\"the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German 'left' of the 1920s\\". The group was composed of both intellectuals and workers and agreed with the idea that the main enemies of society were the bureaucracies which governed modern capitalism. They documented and analysed the struggle against that bureaucracy in the group's journal. As an example, the thirteenth issue (January‚ÄìMarch 1954) was devoted to the East German revolt of June 1953 and the strikes which erupted amongst several sectors of French workers that summer. Following from the belief that what the working class was addressing in their daily struggles was the real content of socialism, the intellectuals encouraged the workers in the group to report on every aspect of their working lives. = Situationist International = The Situationist International (SI) was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented general wildcat strikes of May 1968 in France. With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic avant-gardes, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the construction of situations, namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in advanced capitalism. Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like mass media and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to occupy the factories and to run them with direct democracy through workers' councils composed by instantly revocable delegates. After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,The Beginning of an Era (part1, part 2) Situationist International #12, 1969 the SI was dissolved in 1972. = Solidarity = Solidarity was a small libertarian socialist organisation from 1960 to 1992 in the United Kingdom. It published a magazine of the same name. Solidarity was close to council communism in its prescriptions and was known for its emphasis on workers' self-organisation and for its radical anti- Leninism. Solidarity was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League. It was initially known as Socialism Reaffirmed. The group published a journal, Agitator, which after six issues was renamed Solidarity, from which the organisation took its new name. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. Solidarity existed as a nationwide organisation with groups in London and many other cities until 1981, when it imploded after a series of political disputes. The magazine Solidarity continued to be published by the London group until 1992‚Äîother former Solidarity members were behind Wildcat in Manchester and Here and Now magazine in Glasgow. The intellectual leader of the group was Chris Pallis, whose pamphlets (written under the name Maurice Brinton) included Paris May 1968, The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control 1917-21 and The Irrational in Politics.Now collected in a book, Maurice Brinton, For Workers' Power. Other key Solidarity writers were Andy Anderson (author of Hungary 1956), Ken Weller (who wrote several pamphlets on industrial struggles and oversaw the group's Motor Bulletins on the car industry), Joe Jacobs (Out of the Ghetto), John Quail (The Slow-Burning Fuse), Phil Mailer (Portugal:The Impossible Revolution) John King (The Political Economy of Marx, A History of Marxian Economics), George Williamson (writing as James Finlayson, Urban Devastation - The Planning of Incarceration), David Lamb (Mutinies) and Liz Willis (Women in the Spanish Revolution). = Autonomism = Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian autonomism Autonomism refers to a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system, it first emerged in Italy in the 1960s from workerist (operaismo) communism. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the Situationists, the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of Potere Operaio, Mario Tronti and Paolo Virno. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the Johnson‚ÄìForest Tendency and in France by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie. It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide social centre movement and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to post-structuralists and anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as autonomists. The Italian operaismo (\\"workerism\\") movement also influenced Marxist academics such as Harry Cleaver, John Holloway, Steve Wright and Nick Dyer-Witheford. = Communization = Communization mainly refers to a contemporary communist theory in which we find is a \\"mixing-up of insurrectionist anarchism, the communist ultra-left, postautonomists, anti- political currents, groups like the Invisible Committee, as well as more explicitly 'communizing' currents, such as Th√©orie Communiste and Endnotes. Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process\\".Benjamin Noys (ed). Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles. Minor Compositions, Autonomedia. 2011. 1st ed. The association of the term communization with a self-identified \\"ultra-left\\" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism, but a vision of communist revolution itself. Thus the 1975 Pamphlet A World Without Money states that \\"insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself\\". The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by Gilles Dauv√© and Th√©orie Comuniste, two key figures in this tendency. However, in the late 1990s a close but not identical sense of \\"communization\\" was developed by the French post-situationist group Tiqqun. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with \\"the revolution\\" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities‚Äîfrom squatting and setting up communes to simply \\"sharing\\"‚Äîthat would typically be understood as \\"pre-revolutionary\\".\\"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of communisation, of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process.\\" Anonymous, Call From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of \\"dropping-out\\" or, as Tiqqun put it, \\"desertion\\"‚Äîsetting up spaces and practices that are held to partially autonomous from capitalism‚Äîis typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of \\"communization\\" See also Dauv√© and Nesic, \\"Un Appel et une Invite\\". Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works Call and The Coming Insurrection in the United States anarchist circles it tended to be this latter sense of \\"communization\\" that was employed in U.S. anarchist and \\"insurrectionist\\" communiques, notably within the Californian student movement of 2009‚Äì2010.See e.g. \\"After the Fall: Communiqu√©s from Occupied California\\" See also * Democracy in Marxism  References   Bibliography  * Pioneers of Anti-Parliamentarism by Guy Aldred.

Michael Wotruba was a pseudonym then used by Joe D'Amato. D'Amato is credited in both versions as cinematographer under his birth name Aristide Massaccesi. In an interview, D'Amato said the Italian producer Franco Gaudenzi did not trust Carver, who was sent by Roger Corman, and sent D'Amato to take care of the cinematography and help Carver if needed. According to D'Amato, Carver ended up directing the scenes with dialogues whereas he himself took care of the fight sequences in the arena.

Memorial Stadium is also home to other events, such as local little league and middle school football contests and, beginning with the class of 2004, once again home to Broken Bow High School's commencement ceremony. Overview Originally a wooden stadium with a capacity of 2,500, the modern Memorial Stadium is constructed primarily of concrete and native rock and stands as one of the oldest and largest high school football stadiums in the state of Oklahoma. The stadium's nickname, \\"Over the Mountain,\\" is a term attributed to the long road trip through the Ouachita Mountains that many teams face when having to travel to Broken Bow to play the Savages. Thanks to the contributions of the community, much of the stadium has been renovated, including the home-side press box and the new scoreboard (updated in 2003). The classic \\"Home of the Savages\\" banner that crowned the old scoreboard has now been re-painted and added to the home-side press box. Memorial Stadium has a grass playing surface, featuring the classic Broken Bow arrowhead logo at midfield. The main pressbox is located on top of the south stands on the home side at Memorial Stadium. An additional pressbox is located on top of the north stands, which serves the coaches and media for visiting teams. Due to the large support of the community for the football team, roughly half of the north stands is used for additional seating for Broken Bow fans. Metal bleachers constructed in the southwest and southeast corners of the stadium during the 2005 renovation allow for even more seating for Savage fans. =2005 Renovation= Stadium improvements completed in the summer of 2005 include a fresh coat of paint, a new roof for the field house, updated electrical systems, a new east endzone camera, the addition of a new storage area, added improvements to the ladies restroom, and a new concession stand.

Over 160,000New York Ferries , by Theodore W.

After the attack, the World Trade Center station remained closed for two years. The Exchange Place station was also forced to close due to flooding of the PATH transit tunnel. PATH service to Lower Manhattan was restored in 2003 after the opening of a temporary station on the World Trade Center site. In the intervening time period, transit service to Lower Manhattan was largely covered by rapid expansion of NY Waterway ferry service. Many schools in New Jersey closed for the day, evacuated, or were locked-down. The destruction of 30% (28.7 million sq ft) of Lower Manhattan office space accelerated the pre-2001 trend of moving jobs from Lower Manhattan to Midtown and New Jersey. Many questioned whether this loss of jobs and its associated tax base would ever be restored. Anthrax attacks A letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle containing 'weaponized' anthrax powder caused the deaths of two postal workers. Over several weeks in late 2001, seven letters, all bearing a Trenton, New Jersey postmark and containing anthrax bacteria, were mailed to several news media offices and two US Senators, resulting in the deaths of five people and causing twenty-two people to develop anthrax infections. The crime still remains unsolved. The first set of anthrax letters were postmarked September 18, 2001, exactly one week after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Five letters are believed to have been mailed at this time, to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the New York Post, all in New York City; and the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. (AMI) in Boca Raton, Florida. AMI also publishes a tabloid called Sun where Robert Stevens, the first person who died from the mailings, worked. Only the New York Post and NBC News letters were actually found; the existence of the other three letters is inferred from the pattern of infection.Some unconventional theories of the case do not posit five letters . The anthrax found in the New York Post letter is reported to have become damp before being discovered. Scientists examining the anthrax from the New York Post letter said it appeared as a coarse brown granular material looking like Purina Dog Chow. Two additional anthrax letters, bearing the same Trenton postmark, were dated October 9, three weeks after the first mailing. The letters were addressed to two Democratic Senators, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. More potent than the first anthrax letters, the material in the Senate letters was a highly refined dry powder consisting of approximately one gram of nearly pure spores. Some reports described the material in the Senate letters as \\"weaponized\\" or \\"weapons grade\\" anthrax. The Daschle letter was opened by an aide on October 15, and the government mail service was shut down. The unopened Leahy letter was discovered in an impounded mail bag on November 16. The Leahy letter had been misdirected to the State Department mail annex in Sterling, Virginia, due to a misread Zip code; a postal worker there, David Hose, contracted inhalation anthrax. Twenty-two people developed anthrax infections, eleven of the life- threatening inhalation variety. Five died of inhalation anthrax. In addition to the death of Robert Stevens in Florida, two died from unknown sources, possibly cross-contamination of mail: Kathy Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant from New York City; and Ottilie Lundgren, a 94-year-old woman from Oxford, Connecticut, who was the final victim. The two remaining deaths were employees of the Brentwood mail facility in Washington, D.C., Thomas Morris Jr. and Joseph Curseen. Thousands of people took a two-month course of the antibiotic Cipro in an effort to preempt anthrax infections. Associated Press reported that members of Vice President Cheney's staff took Cipro a week before the first anthrax attack. As of 2006, the investigation seems to have gone cold. Authorities have traveled to four different continents, interviewed more than 8,000 individuals and have issued over 5,000 subpoenas. The number of FBI agents assigned to the case is now 21, ten fewer than a year ago, and the number of postal inspectors investigating the case is nine.\\"Little Progress In FBI Probe of Anthrax Attacks\\", The Washington Post, September 16, 2005 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091502456_pf.html\\"In 4-Year Anthrax Hunt, F.B.I. Finds Itself Stymied and Sued\\", The New York Times, September 17, 2005 2004-2005 Gubernatorial vacancy Governor Jon Corzine. Former Governor James E. McGreevey resigned on November 15, 2004 after charges of pay-to-play and extortion scandals involving the impropriety of the appointment of a homosexual love interest. New Jersey had no Lieutenant Governor position at the time, leaving a vacancy in the office. Senate President Richard Codey served as Acting Governor (then Governor) in McGreevey's place. Jon Corzine was elected Governor of New Jersey on November 8, 2005, and took office on January 17, 2006. On Election Day, November 8, 2005, the voters passed an amendment to the state constitution creating the position of Lieutenant Governor, effective with the 2009 elections. The amendment also provides that in the event of a permanent vacancy in the office of Governor now that Governor Corzine has been sworn in and before the first Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey takes office in 2010, the President of the Senate, followed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, would become Governor (rather than Acting Governor) and will be required to vacate his or her Senate (or Assembly) seat. 2006 government shutdown After the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline, the state government shutdown beginning at midnight on July 1, 2006. Operation did not resume until the legislature adopted a budget on July 8. Civil unions legalized A bill was passed legalizing Civil unions between homosexual couples, taking effect February 19, 2007. The bill grants all of the same rights as those granted to married heterosexual couples. Don Imus vs. Rutgers and the Corzine crash Governor Jon Corzine was nearly killed in a car wreck on the Garden State Parkway in Galloway Township in 2007, as he was traveling to a meeting between a Rutgers sports team and radio personality Don Imus. Imus had infamously called the Rutgers University women's basketball team \\"nappy-headed hos\\", leading to his firing by two communications networks. Imus met with the team at Drumthwacket to apologize, and Governor Corzine attempted to arrive at that meeting from Atlantic City, reaching speeds of at least 91 mph (146 km/h), without wearing a seatbelt. His chauffeur, a New Jersey State Police officer, lost control of the vehicle, seriously injuring the Governor and leading to a new period of acting governorship by Richard Codey while Corzine recuperated. 2010s Chris Christie became governor in 2010 and promoted a number of budget cuts. At around the same time, a controversial television show called Jersey Shore began airing. It features the Jersey Shore and its inhabitants. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City and caused devastation throughout the state, particularly at the Jersey Shore. At that time, widespread power outages lasted for days, while other areas were left powerless for over a week. Mantoloking and Seaside Heights were two of the most adversely affected towns by flooding. In 2014, Super Bowl 48 took place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. In 2018, Phil Murphy became governor.

Geography An intermontaine valley at approximately elevation, Sierra Valley is surrounded by mountains ranging in elevation from 6,000 to . The huge valley, , is a down-faulted basin, formerly a lake of similar geologic origin to Lake Tahoe to the south, now filled with sediment up to two thousand feet thick. The former Lake has the suggested name of Lake Beckwourth and existed until approximately 10,000 years ago. https://www.sierracountyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sierran- Winter-2015.pdf Average annual rainfall is less than twenty inches, most falling as snow. The valley floor has a grassland and sagebrush ecosystem and is the site of extensive freshwater marshes filled with cattails, bulrushes and alkaline flats that drain into the Middle Fork Feather River. Many species of wildlife make their permanent home in the valley, and a great number of migratory bird species stop over in the fall and nest in the valley in the spring. The valley also has thermal activity, with Marble Hot Springs located in the north central valley floor. Economy Sierra Valley is an agricultural and livestock region. Tourism also contributes to the local economy. Access Entrance from the west is through Yuba Pass on State Route 49. Entrance from the east is through Beckwourth Pass, the lowest mountain pass on the crest of the Sierra Nevada, on State Route 70. State Route 89 skirts the southern end of the valley. State Route 49, the Gold Rush trail, terminates at State Route 70 in Vinton, and the latter highway then terminates at Hallelujah Junction on U.S. Route 395 after passing through Chilcoot.

The island is on the reach above Hambleden Lock between the Buckinghamshire and Berkshire banks, and is part of Remenham in Berkshire. The main significance of the island is that it lies at the start of the course for Henley Royal Regatta. The island includes an elegant ornamental temple (a folly) designed by the 18th century English architect James Wyatt and constructed in 1771. It was designed as a fishing lodge for Fawley Court, a nearby historic house that Wyatt also remodelled in the 1770s on the commission of its owner, Sambrooke Freeman. Wyatt designed both the structure of the building and its interior decoration; it is likely that he also provided designs for the original furniture. The wall paintings in the principal room are thought to be the earliest surviving example of the Etruscan style in Great Britain, predating more famous examples such as the Etruscan Dressing Room at Osterley Park by Robert Adam. In the 19th century, the island's ownership passed, with Fawley Court, from the Freeman family to the Mackenzie family. In 1952, upon the death of Roderick Mackenzie, Henley Royal Regatta asked his daughter Margaret for 'first refusal' should she ever decide to sell the island. It is not clear whether an understanding was reached. By the early 1980s, the advent of corporate entertaining greatly increased the potential value of the island. In 1983 the Stewards of the Regatta again began making overtures to Margaret Mackenzie but in 1986 the island was placed on the open market. Supported by a gift of ¬£515,000 from Alan Burrough (a Steward of the Regatta) and his wife Rosie, in December 1987 the Regatta was able to purchase a 999-year lease of the island and the temple. Following the purchase, the Stewards of the Regatta undertook restoration works to the island and the temple. The downstream portion of the island was retained as a nature reserve and was extensively replanted with trees. The Victorian balcony which had decayed was replaced. The wall paintings, which had deteriorated and had been badly over-painted, were repaired and brought back to the colours originally intended by Wyatt. A statue of a nymph, in keeping with the style and age of the Temple, was placed under the cupola. The location was featured in the music video of \\"Never Turn Away\\" by Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark. In an effort to prevent damage to the Temple or to its garden, visitors are barred from mooring or setting foot on the island without written permission from the Henley Royal Regatta Committee.

He was head coach of Scotland until 2017 and was the longest reigning coach in the nation's history having held the role since 2004. He has also had an extensive club coaching career, having coached Salford City Reds in the Super League and Whitehaven Warriors, Widnes Vikings, Barrow Raiders Swinton Lions and Gloucestershire All Golds in the Rugby League Championships. Coaching career Steve McCormack is the son of the former rugby league footballer for Oldham, James \\"Jim\\" McCormack. His first coaching appointment was in 2001, at Salford City Reds, which made him at the age of 28 the youngest coach in the Super League. He was sacked 10 months later, after a run of poor results. He later won National League One Coach of the Year having twice taken Whitehaven Warriors to the Grand Final but losing to Leigh Centurions (2004) and Castleford Tigers (2005) to miss out on promotion to Super League. He was appointed coach of Widnes Vikings after the club's relegation from Super League in 2005 and the subsequent departure of Frank Endacott. In his first season with Widnes he led the club to the National League One grand final where they subsequently lost to the Hull Kingston Rovers. During the 2007 season McCormack won the Northern Rail Cup beating his old side Whitehaven Warriors 56-6 in the final at Blackpool. McCormack was soon after rewarded with a new 2-year contract keeping him with Widnes until the end of the 2009 season. Widnes failed to gain promotion to Super League losing out to Castleford Tigers in the 2007 National League One Grand Final. In October 2007 Steve McCormack left Widnes and joined the Hull Kingston Rovers as assistant coach to Justin Morgan. However, nine days later after leaving Widnes Vikings, Steve returned as head coach with a new set up after Steve O'Connor took over the club. In February 2009 Steve parted company with Widnes and this is thought to have happened after a poor performance against Oldham. He was taken over by assistant John Stankevitch in a caretaker role. On 22 October 2009 he was named as the new head coach of Barrow Raiders. McCormack resigned from Barrow at the end of the 2010 season and moved to Swinton Lions for the 2011 season, before leaving prior to the 2013 Championship season. Background Steve McCormack was born in Wigan, Lancashire. International coaching career McCormack has held the position as coach of Scotland since 2004. He was in charge for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup campaign, in which Scotland registered their first victory at a World Cup. He was also in charge of Scotland's 2013 Rugby League World Cup campaign, in which Scotland earned their best result in a World Cup, finishing in the quarter-final stages.

Accentual- syllabic verse is highly regular and therefore easily scannable. Usually, either one metrical foot, or a specific pattern of metrical feet, is used throughout the entire poem; thus one can speak about a poem being in, for example, iambic pentameter. Poets naturally vary the rhythm of their lines, using devices such as inversion, elision, masculine and feminine endings, the caesura, using secondary stress, the addition of extra-metrical syllables, or the omission of syllables, the substitution of one foot for another. Accentual-syllabic verse dominated literary poetry in English from Chaucer's day until the 19th century, when the freer approach to meter championed by poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Ralph Waldo Emerson and the radically experimental verse of Gerard Manley Hopkins and Walt Whitman began to challenge its dominance.Stallworthy, Jon. ‚ÄúVersification.‚Äù Norton Anthology of Poetry. Ed. Margaret Ferguson, Mary Jo Salter, and Jon Stallworthy. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2005. 1251-1275. In the early 20th Century, accentual-syllabic verse was largely supplanted by free verse through the efforts of Modernists such as Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Nonetheless, some poets, such as Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, Keith Douglas, Robert Lowell, Philip Larkin, Howard Nemerov, James Merrill, Derek Walcott, Geoffrey Hill, Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon continued to work (though not exclusively) in accentual-syllabic meters throughout the century. Though it has not regained its position of dominance within English poetry, accentual-syllabic verse remains viable and popular in the 21st century, as evidenced by the success of such poets as Richard Wilbur and the various New Formalists. Examples The Gashlycrumb Tinies, a 1963 book by Edward Gorey, is written in strict 10-syllable lines consisting of three dactyls plus a final stressed syllable: \\"She Walks in Beauty\\", an 1814 poem by Lord Byron, is written in strict iambic tetrameter: Robert Browning's One Word More is an example of 10-syllable lines in trochaic metre:Joseph Berg Esenwein, Mary Eleanor Roberts, The Art of Versification, Springfield 1920, p. 138.

At age 6, he learned to play chess from his grandfather. In 1985, at age 16, he started studies at Moscow's famous Botvinnik-Kasparov Chess School. During his military service in Novosibirsk, he attended the 27th World Junior Chess Championship held in 1988 in Adelaide, Australia. In this strong tournament Serper took 3rd place with same score 9/13 as his opponents Lautier, Ivanchuk and Gelfand who took 1st, 2nd and 4th place respectively.Chess Informant, Vol. 46, ≈†ahovski Informator, p. 448Here you can find an interesting story about this tournament written by Serper himself. In 1992, as a member of the Uzbekistan team, Serper won the silver medal in the 30th Chess Olympiad. In January 1996 he moved with his family to the United States. In 1999, Serper won the World Open tournament after drawing an Armageddon playoff game as Black against Boris Gulko, who had been one of nine players who had tied with Serper in the main event.Grandmasters Serper, Gulko, Vladimir Akopian, Joel Benjamin, Jaan Ehlvest, Alexander Fishbein, Igor Novikov, Alexander Shabalov, Georgi Timoshenko, and Alex Yermolinsky tied for first at 7-2 in the main event. Seven of those ten players chose to participate in a blitz playoff, which Serper and Gulko won with 5/6. Gulko and Serper then played the Armageddon game, with Gulko taking White and receiving six minutes to five minutes time odds, but giving draw odds to Serper. The game ended in a draw after 43 moves.

Most of the stories were first serialized in Argosy, an American pulp magazine. It is sometimes known as the Carson Napier of Venus Series, after its main character, Carson Napier. Napier attempted a solo voyage to Mars, but, because of mistaken navigational calculations, he finds himself heading toward the planet Venus instead. The novels, part of the Sword and Planet subgenre of science fiction, follow earthman Napier's fantastic adventures after he crash- lands on Venus, called Amtor by its human-like inhabitants. Unlike Barsoom, the desert planet of Mars, these stories are set upon a waterworld like Earth. Most of the events of the series take place on the island of Vepaja, the kingdom of Korva on the island of Anlap, and the city-states of Havatoo and Kormor on the tropical continent north of Vepaja. As is common in Burroughs' works, the hero is bold and daring, and quickly wins the heart of the Vepajan princess (or janjong) Duare, though class prejudices long inhibit her from expressing her love. Napier meets many varied peoples, including the Vepajans, refugees from an overthrown empire; the Thorists, thinly disguised communists who ran the Vepajans out of what is now the Thoran empire; pirates; the super- scientific eugenicists of Havatoo; the zombies of Kormor; the fascistic Zanis of Korva; and the hideous Cloud People. In the course of his adventures within the series, Napier becomes a pirate (twice), escapes from the dread Room of the Seven Doors, and is finally made a prince, or tanjong, of Korva after the overthrow of the Zanis. Napier also rescues princesses from incomparable dangers innumerable times. Amtorian geography Amtor is a verdant world shielded from the heat of the sun by a (nearly) perpetual cloud cover. The portion depicted, largely confined to the southern hemisphere's temperate zone (or Trabol, as it is known to its inhabitants), is primarily oceanic, but includes two continents and a number of large islands. The main continent is Thora, extending also far into the tropical zone of Strabol and the arctic zone of Karbol -‚Äì possibly as far as the south pole. The Great and Small Circles correspond to the Antarctic Circle and Tropic of Capricorn on Earth (although Burroughs does erroneously state in the second book, Lost on Venus, that the Small Circle is the equator, and Strabol in the Northern Hemisphere, forgetting that the tropics are on both sides of the equator). Several smaller land masses projecting into Trabol from Karbol appear to be peninsular extensions of Thora; these include Bombaj, Ator, Rovlap, Vodaro, and Vaxlap. Interspersed among these are the great islands of Ganfal, Malpi, Donuk, Movis, Nor, Anlap, Vepaja, Trambol, and Zanbo. The unnamed second continent is a largely tropical landmass north of Vepaja and west of Thora. Amtorian vegetation, particularly on Vepaja, tends to be gigantic. Vepaja is notable for the enormous forests Napier first encounters upon his arrival, with trees reaching into the inner cloud envelope. Elsewhere, the geography of Amtor is more varied, and he also travels through a dismal pine forest, grassland plains, glacial valleys, and several mountain ranges. Amtorian animals likewise tend to be larger than their Earthly equivalents, and the large species are much more common than they are on Earth, which makes them much more dangerous than Earth fauna and has helped limit exploration of the planet by its natives. The other impediment to communication, Amtor's quirky cartography, stems from the inhabitants' bizarre cosmology, which at least in the southern hemisphere where Napier lands holds that the world is a flat disc floating on a burning sea of lava, with a rim of ice and a center of fire. As the \\"rim\\" is actually the south pole, and the \\"center\\" the equator, Amtorians have an extraordinarily distorted, backward view of their planet's surface, and their maps are warped accordingly. Due to the near-perpetual overcast, they have no celestial markers to correct their geographical mismeasurements, let alone on which to base the concepts of a solar system, other worlds, or the stars. On those rare occasions when the sun does appear through a hole in the clouds, its searing light and heat (twice that on Earth) starts to burn everything; at night, when a hole reveals a few stars, the Amtorians think they are \\"sparks\\" from the lava sea supposedly surrounding the planet, and are thus unaware that they are fixed, and have never tried plotting them. All this also means that, unlike Napier, they do not suspect that the northern hemisphere even exists. Napier tries to correct them, but they subscribe to a \\"theory of relative distance\\" formulated by one of their scientists, Klufar, and would not accept Napier's correction. The difference between the observed and theoretical versions of geography are reconciled by a pseudo-scientific \\"Theory of Relativity of Distance\\", which resolves the problem by multiplying by the square root of minus one. Napier finds it difficult to counter this rationale, noting that \\"You cannot argue with a man who can multiply by the square root of minus one.\\" Such wry digs are typical of the series. Ironically, Napier finds the simpler Thorans more amenable to his ideas (including believing that he came from another planet) than the more sophisticated Vepajans. Amtorian culture Aside from the sophisticated, cultured, and advanced Vepajans that Napier first meets, the human natives of Amtor are generally inhospitable, often trying to murder Napier, kidnap his princess, or both. Their nations are rather loosely connected, partly because the geography is strewn with impassable mountains, impenetrable forests, and unnavigable seas (which Napier nevertheless passes, penetrates, and navigates), and partly because Amtorian maps are inaccurate. In spite of their relative isolation from each other, a worldwide language is current among all peoples. The level of culture runs the spectrum from savagery to advanced technology; some nations possess a longevity serum, atomic ray guns, and nuclear powered ships. (Burroughs speculated on Element 93 being used for nuclear power, specifically, for RTGs; in reality, certain uranium and plutonium isotopes are used.) Radio is unknown (the ships are reduced to communicating by flags), and there are no native aircraft. In fact, Napier himself designs and builds the first based on Earth technology, which if anything, is an improvement over Earth aircraft in its use of an Amtorian RTG, which enables it to fly silently, hover, and to run almost indefinitely without refueling. The Amtorian language is described as having a fairly simple agglutinative grammar, enabling Napier to learn it fairly quickly. The plural prefix is kloo- (kl- if the noun begins with a vowel), and the definite article is voo. Napier uses an Anglicized spelling (such as often writing /u/ as oo [the Amtorian u does actually look like a ligature of two Amtorian o's, as shown on Burroughs' map of Amtor], or referring to the diphthong /ai/ as \\"long i\\"), but describes the vowel system as being simple five-vowel one which renders Amtorians unable to correctly pronounce many English vowels. As with the speakers of many Earth languages, including Spanish, Georgian, or Japanese, and based on the Amtorian placenames and personal names in the story, the vowels appear to simply be /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. Napier does explicitly exclude /…î/ and /…™/ from the vowel inventory, along with the diphthong /ei/, as he states, \\"The native Amtorians are unable to pronounce a long A or a short O, and the I is always long\\". Note that /i/, where it exists, is spelled with an Amtorian e, as in Duare, and possibly with y as well; /ai/, as Napier suggests and as the Amtor maps show, has its own single letter. Punctuation marks are similar to ones on Earth in most respects, although Amtorians also have equivalents to the Spanish inverted marks. Vepaja: This society is the one Napier first encounters upon landing on the planet. They are described as of being of a medium skin tone, with dark hair and eyes (comparable to Middle Easterners on Earth), and good-looking. They take an anti-aging serum which extends their lifespan indefinitely, so they all appear to be in their 20s or 30s. There are few children; as space in the society is limited, the Vepajans issue just enough permits to their women to have children to replace those Vepajans who get killed or kidnapped. Also, about half of the women are infertile, apparently eventually undergoing menopause despite the anti-aging serum, so the Vepajans actually issue two childbearing permits for every lost Vepajan. However, Venusians appear to under normal conditions live and age about as long as Earth humans do; Princess Duare was 18 when she and Napier first met. The Vepajans were once the elite of a nation that controlled the continent of Thora until the Thorist Revolution, when many were killed and the remainder fled to the isolated island with gigantic trees where they could hide. However, they are still subject to raids and abductions by the Thorists, whose society is decaying due to the lack of intelligent, competent people. Thora: The former land of the Vepajans, it was taken over by the Thorists and named after Thor, the leader of the Thorist Revolution. Burroughs based Thorism on Communism or Marxism, and Thor based his revolution on overthrowing the elites of Vepaja in a class war and replacing them with his own party's members. High Thorist officials, known as ongyans, are now the elite of Thora. However, due to the fact that the Vepajan elite was more capable at running the country than the Thorists, the Thorists now attempt to kidnap Vepajan men to help keep the infrastructure running, and Vepajan women for eugenic purposes. In addition, as the Thorists have lost knowledge of the Vepajan anti-aging serum, they now once again age and die from disease just like humans on Earth; Vepajan doctors, who are rare in Vepaja itself, are in particular demand. Thorist towns are described as dingy and ugly, with coldly utilitarian buildings, and Thorans are described as being considerably uglier than, and not as intelligent as, the Vepajans. Their internal problems notwithstanding, the Thorists have also established colonies in other places, such as the town of Kapdor on the coast of Noobol, and are the closest thing on Amtor to a world power. Angans: They are winged humanoids whose faces somewhat bear a resemblance to a bird, with long beaky noses. Those that Napier encounters are also dark-skinned, like Africans on Earth. As they are Thorists, they are often enlisted to capture Vepajans due to their ability to fly. They have hollow bones like Earth birds to reduce their weight, although their bat-like wings are barely strong enough for them to carry one regular human. Normally, to aid mobility, raiding parties are structured so that two angans carry one human. Nobargans: These are described as brutish humans barely separated from apes, ugly and covered with hair, who live in the country of Noobol (at least). They, or at least their chieftains, are able to speak, and use the same language as the other societies on the planet, although their vocabulary is limited. At least some nobargans are cannibals. Morov: A country to the west of Noobol, it is ruled by Skor, who is originally from further north in Strabol, but who is at enmity with both his former homeland as well as the Thorans. Unfortunately, Skor is an arrogant mad scientist who captures people and turns them into zombies. Morov's main city is Kormor, on a wide river across from the larger city of Havatoo (which Skor is also at enmity with). All of Skor's own subjects are zombies, although a tribe of hostile pygmies also lives in one area, and a few of Kormor's original living inhabitants also remain in the city, although they are now all elderly. The zombies are capable of speech, and occasionally infiltrate Havatoo by disguising themselves, and if caught, are executed by decapitation and cremation, as they are very difficult to \\"kill\\", being already technically dead. Havatoo: A larger city directly across from Kormor, it is a society that practices eugenics, and is ruled by a five-man council consisting of a biologist, psychologist, chemist, physicist, and soldier, and the classes of Havatoo are built around each of these professions, with the city sectioned accordingly. Like the Vepajans, the Havatooans are good-looking, intelligent, and cultured, and take youth serum, but limit their own lifespans to three hundred years to enable the eugenics to proceed. Napier, who actually failed his own eugenics test but was spared due to his coming from Earth and the useful knowledge he had constructed Venus' first aircraft in Havatoo. Also, to support himself while there, he taught successful, in-demand astronomy classes. (Note that Burroughs never uses either the term \\"zombie\\" or \\"eugenics\\" in the books.) Samary: A tribe that lives down-river from Havatoo in a set of caves. Somewhat like the mythical Amazons, their sex roles are flipped, with the women being larger, stronger, and more aggressive than the men, who have feminine-sounding names. Napier has to rescue Duare from one of their cave villages, Houtomai. Korva: A kingdom in the land of Anlap, across the sea to the northwest from Vepaja. Its capital is Amlot. The people there are normally sociable, but Carson and Duare arrive there in the midst of a civil war, while a group of revolutionaries known as the Zanis, which had previously seized the capital, are besieging and attacking the city of Sanara. The fascistic Zanis, whose troops are noted for their mohawk haircuts (and whose name is a transparent alteration of Nazi), have a hatred for anyone with ancestry from Ator, another land across the ocean to the southwest of Anlap, because of their large ears.

The strike was caused by discontent over increase of production quotas coincided with nation-wide increase in dairy and meat prices. The events spurred into a mass protest at the administration building in the center of the city where armed forces dispersed protesters by gunfire. According to official investigation 26 were reportedly killed by troops, and 87 were wounded. According to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago (page 449 in the abridged version) \\"Information from a variety of sources is more or less unanimous that some seventy or eighty people were killed\\". Arrests, show trials and cover-ups ensued aftermath: more than 200 were arrested; 7 people were convicted and sentenced to death over various \\"crimes\\" such as \\"mass disorder\\" and approximately hundreds of others were imprisoned up to 15 years (terms of some of which were later reduced);Taubman, William. Khrushchev: The Man and His Era, First Edition, W. W. Norton & Co., New York, NY. 2003. news about events never appeared in state controlled press and held secret up until 1992. The 26 dead were secretly buried by KGB operatives in false graves which were never disclosed to relatives until June 2, 1994 when all bodies were discovered and reburied at the official memorial. In 1992, shortly after the Soviet Union's collapse, the events were investigated by General Prosecutor. Major suspects among the highest soviet officials such as Nikita Khrushchev, Anastas Mikoyan, Frol Kozlov and several others who were deemed responsible for the massacre were never held accountable due to their deaths by the time the investigation has started. The fate of others as of 2019 remains unknown. The massacre is commemorated each year on the anniversary of the murders by group of survived participants of the protests.  Timeline  = May = * May 1-7: According to V. A. Kozlov, the first signs of discontent among workers were expressed long before the massacre happened. The first isolated cases of individual strikes at the NEBF were recorded. It was claimed that among the strikers were many experienced political prisoners who were previously repressed by the Soviet regime, but this is not supported by any evidence. * May 17: The Council of Ministers issued decree No. 456, which declared a nationwide increase in the price of various items planned to come into effect on June 1. * May 31: The first news of the No. 456 decree appeared in the Soviet press. = June = * June 1: The protests grew. At this time the strikers were harassed by Soviet army personnel, soviet militsiya with various clashes between them and the protesters, who attempted to spark strikes in other factories around NEBF. * June 2: The strike over the NEBF continued overnight. In the early morning thousands marched from NEBF toward Novocherkassk's centre carrying portraits of Lenin and red flags; they were heading toward buildings of the city's council and executive committee; though disorganised at this point the crowd was calm and peaceful. The crowd crossed the bridge spanning the Tuzlov river and was met by tanks commanded by Colonel Matvey Shaposhnikov who refused to open fire at the people; at the time many members of the CC of the CPSU, KGB, MIA and other high officials had already arrived and were present in the city. By the time the crowd reached the centre of the city authorities learned that they had passed the bridge unopposed - consequently deciding to quickly retreat into safety. As the march continued to advance toward the centre, more people started to join crowd, frightening the authorities further. The crowd attacked and looted several administrative buildings and police stations, sparking brief violence; demands to Mikoyan to come out and speak to people followed. At midday the army attempted to disperse the crowd using soldiers and armoured personnel carriers but failed and shortly after fired at the people, claiming the lives of 22 and wounding many others, including soldiers. On the evening of the same day, two protesters were killed according to officials. * June 2-3: A curfew was imposed and lasted more than a week; Protests continued though at smaller scale. = July = *July 19: Some of the protesters were sentenced to ten years in prison. = October = * October 19: A report about rumours of the massacre appeared in Time Magazine. History The riots were a direct result of shortages of food and provisions, as well as the poor working conditions in the factory. The protest began on June 1 in the Budyonny Electric Locomotive Factory, when workers from the foundry and forge shops stopped work after factory management refused to hear their complaints. The strike and attendant discussions had spread throughout the whole factory by noon. The unrest began when Nikita Khrushchev raised the prices of meat and butter throughout the Soviet Union on June 1. On the same day, as required by a separate economic plan, the minimum production quotas for each worker at the factory were increased,Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshkov, Inside the Kremlin's Cold War: from Stalin to Khrushchev, Harvard University Press, p. 262 thereby effectively reducing pay rates.Hosking, Geoffrey. A History of the Soviet Union, Fontana Press, London. 1992. This culminated in a march on the town hall and police headquarters, and the strike spread to other enterprises after police arrested thirty workers. According to documents declassified in 90's, motorised infantry units were called to suppress the protesters, but they fired in the air, and the lethal fire came from a unit of Internal troops, from Rostov-on-Don composed of 10 snipers and 2 machine guns, who were set up at the \\"Don\\" hotel. Orders to kill were approved through the whole chain of command, from Khrushchev, through the ministry of defense. The Commander of the North-Caucasian Troops, general Matvey Kuzmich Shapochnikov, refused to execute an order to attack peaceful demonstrators with tanks (he reportedly said, \\"I don't see any enemy that we could turn our weapons against\\"), for which he was later degraded and arrested.

Due to strong propaganda during the time of the massacre, the mob was overly disillusioned in the soviet army and many did not expect them to fire live rounds at unarmed citizens until the very shooting. After the initial demonstrations, a curfew in the city was imposed. The dead bodies were secretly buried in various cemeteries in towns across the Rostov Oblast. However, the following morning, a large group of several hundred demonstrators again gathered in the square. One hundred and sixteen were arrested, of which fourteen were convicted by show trials. Seven of those fourteen received a death sentence and were executed. The others were sentenced to prison terms of ten to fifteen years. Following the incident, the Soviet government directed extra food supplies to the region and began an investigation. Additional arrests of workers followed, as did courts martial of military officials involved. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn claimed that individuals wounded in the unrest and their families were exiled to Siberia. The whole story was censored by Soviet media and never allowed to any other mass media and remained an official secret until 1992, year after fall of the Soviet Union, when the remains of 20 bodies were recovered and identified in 1992 and buried in the cemetery of Novoshakhtinsk.

It is situated between the Field of Mars and Palace Quay, slightly to the east from New Michael Palace. Design and pre-1917 owners The palace was built as a gift from Empress Catherine the Great for Count Grigory Orlov, her favourite and the most powerful Russian nobleman of the 1760s. Construction started in 1768 to designs by Antonio Rinaldi,http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/ who previously had helped decorate the grand palace at Caserta near Naples, and lasted for 17 years. The combination of sumptuous ornamentation with rigorously classicising monumentality, as practiced by Rinaldi, may be attributed to his earlier work under Luigi Vanvitelli in Italy. The palace takes its name from its opulent decoration in a wide variety of polychrome marbles. A rough-grained Finnish granite on the ground floor is in subtle contrast to polished pink Karelian marble of the pilasters and white Urals marble of capitals and festoons. Panels of veined bluish gray Urals marble separate the floors, while Tallinn dolomite was employed for ornamental urns. In all, 32 disparate shades of marble were used to decorate the palace.http://www.saint- petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/ The plan of the edifice is trapezoidal: each of its four facades, though strictly symmetrical, has a different design. One of the facades conceals a recessed courtyard, where an armored car employed by Lenin during the October Revolution used to be mounted on display between 1937 and 1992. Nowadays, the court is dominated by a sturdy equestrian statue of Alexander III of Russia, the most famous work of sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy; formerly it graced a square before the Moscow Railway Station.Embankment fa√ßade of the Larger Marble Palace. For a night view see here. Fedot Shubin, Mikhail Kozlovsky, Stefano Torelli and other Russian and foreign craftsmen decorated the interior with inlaid coloured marbles, stucco, and statuary until 1785, by which time Count Orlov had already died (1783), and the Empress had the palace purchased for her own heirs. In 1797-1798 the structure was leased to Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, the last king of Poland. Thereafter the palace belonged to Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and his heirs from the Konstantinovichi branch of the House of Romanov. In 1843, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich decided to redecorate the edifice, renaming it Constantine Palace and engaging Alexander Brullov as the architect.http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/ An adjacent church and other outbuildings were completely rebuilt, while the interior of the palace was refurbished in keeping with the eclectic tastes of its new owner. Only the main staircase and the Marble Hall survived that refacing and still retain the refined stucco work and elaborate marble pattern of Rinaldi's original decor. Equestrian statue of Alexander III from Vosstaniya Square Usage during Soviet times During the Soviet era, the palace successively housed the Ministry of Labour (1917-19), the Academy of Material Culture (1919-36), and, most notably, the main local branch of the Moscow-based Central (i.e. National) Lenin Museum (1937-91) with sub-branches across Leningrad in Lenin's memorial apartments all over the city - the places where he lived or stayed during his various periods in what was then Saint Petersburg.

Biography  He was born in Kiev, and studied music at Yale. From 1916 to 1917 he was musical director of the San Francisco People's Philharmonic Orchestra, where he insisted on including women in his orchestra and paying them the same salaries as men received. Before being appointed as the first music director of The Cleveland Orchestra, Sokoloff served as a violinist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra and as concertmaster in the Russian Symphony Orchestra, which at the time was based in New York. He played recitals for American troops in Europe during World War I, and later met Adella Prentiss Hughes in New York City, who encouraged him to play a recital in Cleveland in February 1918. After Hughes heard Sokoloff speaking about the need for public school children to be exposed to professional orchestras, she encouraged him to move to Cleveland. At first, his role was to survey music education within Cleveland‚Äôs public schools. Soon, however, Hughes and Sokoloff, along with John L. Severance, vice-president of the Musical Arts Association (founded by Hughes in 1915), sought to establish a permanent orchestra in Cleveland. As a result, the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra (later renamed The Cleveland Orchestra) was formed and the ensemble gave its first concert on December 11, 1918 at Cleveland‚Äôs Grays Armory. Sokoloff served as the Orchestra‚Äôs music director for another 14 years, until his departure in 1932. During his tenure in Cleveland, Sokoloff expanded both the number of musicians in the Orchestra and the number of programs in its season concert series; he also took the Orchestra on tours across the country. Additionally, Sokoloff led the Orchestra in its first recording project ‚Äî a 1924 performance of Tchaikovsky‚Äôs 1812 Overture, on the Brunswick Label. In the Orchestra‚Äôs second season, the ensemble moved to the Masonic Auditorium, which remained its home until the completion of Severance Hall in 1931. Under Sokoloff‚Äôs musical leadership, the city had an established orchestra of its own. Although the end of Sokoloff‚Äôs time in Cleveland was spoiled by negative press about his personality, conducting style, and lack of cordiality, he made a point to depart on a positive note. When Sokoloff was asked if he ‚Äúhad anything to say to Cleveland before leaving,‚Äù Sokoloff remarked, ‚ÄúTell them good luck, and that I‚Äôve had a good time.\\" Between 1935 and 1938 he directed the Federal Music Project, a New Deal program that employed musicians to educate the public about music. From 1938 to 1941 he directed the Seattle Symphony Orchestra and in 1941 founded the Chamber Music Society (now known as the La Jolla Music Society) in La Jolla, California.

Similar to a v√¢rcolac, although the latter sometimes symbolises a goblin, whereas the pricolici always has wolf-like characteristics. Pricolici, similar to strigoi, are undead souls that have risen from the grave to harm living people. While a strigoi possesses anthropomorphic qualities similar to the ones it had before death, a pricolici always resembles a wolf. Malicious, violent men are often said to become pricolici after death, in order to continue harming other humans. Some Romanian folklore delineates that Pricolici are werewolves in life and after they die, return as vampires. This also gives rise to the legend of vampires that can turn into animals such as wolves, dogs, or owls and bats. The common theme of all these animals being that they are nocturnal hunters much like vampires. Even as recently as modern times, many people living in rural areas of Romania have claimed to have been viciously attacked by abnormally large and fierce wolves.

This wound is often caused by rabbits or other rodents, stripping the bark away and girdling the tree. The inability of the plant to transport food manufactured in the leaves down to the root system, causes the root system to die and in the death cycle, the resulting lack of root system causes the upper portions of the plant to die. Where one-quarter or less of the trunk circumference has been girdled, it may not be necessary to use this technique. It is also difficult on small caliper tree trunks. A bridge graft uses scions to 'bridge' the gap. Each scion is taper cut in order to accommodate the need for matching the cambium layers of the scion with those of the tree being repaired. Once in place the graft wounds must be completely sealed to prevent moving of tissues which would inhibit them from joining together and to prevent dissection of the site which would lead to the death of the scions.  Steps  This link to an Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Factsheet gives details and diagrams for the technique. However, modern arboriculture suggests that the application of pruning paints and wound dressings can inhibit the trees' natural defenses, so a person attempting this technique may try it without the application of wound dressing prior to the graft insertion. Most trees will produce callus tissues compartmentalize the wounded area. This natural defense is stimulated by environmental factors which may include the presence of the 'first arrivals' of fungi and bacteria on the wet wound.

He served as Secretary to the Treasury between 1979 and 1984, and as a senator for Queensland, representing the National Party, from 1987 to 1990. Early life Stone was born on 31 January 1929 in Perth, Western Australia. After gaining first class honours in mathematical physics for his bachelor of science degree and representing his state at hockey (under 21), he was selected as the Rhodes Scholar from Western Australia for 1951. At Oxford he was awarded first class honours in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) and won the James Webb Medley Prize for Economics. Public service career In 1954, Stone returned to Australia and joined the Treasury. He rose within the Treasury department to become Secretary during the period of the Fraser government. He penned a severe critique of Fraser's economic policies, which was used against the Liberal Party once the Australian Labor Party won the 1983 federal election. He supported some of the Hawke-Keating government's economic reforms, although he had little time for Bob Hawke or Paul Keating personally. While his resignation from the Treasury did not become effective until 14 September 1984,Samuel Griffith Society (John Stone: Curriculum Vitae) he announced his imminent departure on 15 August 1984,Quadrant online, July‚ÄìAugust 2011 just six days before the 1984‚Äì85 Budget was handed down. That was seen by commentators at the time as a strongly adverse comment on the government's direction. Despite holding what were seen by some to be neoliberal economic views, Stone initially opposed the decision in December 1983 to float the Australian dollar, and consistently deplored a consumption tax. In fact, after it was introduced, he repeatedly denounced the GST, and then Treasurer Peter Costello. Politics An informal advisor to Queensland's longest-serving premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Stone was elected to the Australian Senate at the 1987 election representing Queensland, as a member of the pro-Bjelke-Petersen National Party. John Howard, Liberal Party leader at the time, appointed Stone as the Opposition finance spokesman. Following the release of the Coalition's One Australia immigration policy in 1988, Stone said: \\"Asian immigration has to be slowed. It's no use dancing around the bushes.\\" In 1990, Stone left the Senate and contested the House of Representatives seat of Fairfax, his Senate place being taken by Bill O'Chee. Unsuccessful in his attempt to win Fairfax, he abandoned parliamentary life but remained very much in the public eye. Later activities After 1990, Stone was an outspoken critic of multiculturalism and a supporter of the Samuel Griffith Society, which he helped found. He had a column on economics and politics in The Australian Financial Review. Other Australian publications for which he wrote include The Sydney Morning Herald, the quarterly National Observer, and Quadrant. Stone was critical of the Howard Government for eroding the power of the states within the Australian federal system, regarding that as a departure from the long-standing Liberal/National coalition support for \\"states' rights\\". Nevertheless, in its March 2008 issue, Quadrant published an article in which Stone argued that Howard had been, on the whole, Australia's greatest Prime Minister.

However, rather than having to make such a choice, she, the prince, and their parents ultimately decide to bring the Kingdom of the Humans and the Kingdom of the Fairies together as one world. =The Princess and the Frog= Princess Rana's kingdom and family are being threatened by the evil and sinister sorcerer Prince Aliyander. However, when the talking frog she befriends comes between her and Aliyander, Aliyander attempts to hurt it, unwittingly freeing the cursed Prince Lian, Aliyander's brother. As a confrontation ensues, Lian aids Rana in defeating Aliyander for good. =The Hunting of the Hind= After her brother is enchanted by the cursed Golden Hind, misfit Princess Korah rides out to chase the hind herself. She follows it inside a stone hill where she finds the hind has turned into a beautiful woman. The woman and her brother tell her of their imprisonment by a jealous sorcerer, and of the terms needed to break the curse. Korah goes to free the siblings, and is successful. The liberated siblings then return to Korah's kingdom, where the prince, whose sickness came from his attempt to break the curse himself, is joyfully waiting for them. =The Twelve Dancing Princesses= This retelling of the classic fairy tale follows the tale faithfully with a few added details. When the twelve daughters of the king start mysteriously wearing out their dancing shoes, he tries to uncover the mystery, but only finds out that his daughters are cursed. He sends out an invitation allowing any man to have one of his daughters' hand in marriage in return for breaking the curse. Meanwhile, a weary soldier is told the whole story of the curse by an old woman: the princesses are being forced to dance with a witch's twelve demonic sons so that she may entrap the girls so tightly that they'll be forced to marry them. The soldier takes up the challenge, and is given a magic cloak to make him invisible. The soldier uses the cloak to follow the princesses for the three nights to an underground, magical kingdom, taking a couple of objects back with him. On the morning of the final night, the soldier reveals the mystery to an assembly, and a sudden earthquake buries the entrance to the underground kingdom forever. The eldest princess marries the soldier.

Known for most of its length as Ridgely Road, the state highway runs from MD 404 in Hillsboro east to MD 313 in Greensboro. MD 480 passes through Ridgely, where it has a concurrency with MD 312. The state highway was constructed between Ridgely and Greensboro in the early 1930s. MD 480 was rerouted in both towns in the early 1950s before being extended west to Hillsboro in the late 1950s.  Route description  View east along MD 480 at MD 312 in Ridgely MD 480 begins at an intersection with MD 404 in Hillsboro. Ridgely Road continues south toward the center of Hillsboro. MD 480 heads northeast as a two-lane undivided road through farmland until it meets MD 312 (Downes Station Road) on the outskirts of Ridgely. The two state highways continue northeast, with MD 776 (Sunset Boulevard) splitting to the north immediately before the road enters the town limits of Ridgely, where its name temporarily changes to Sixth Street and the highway passes Martin Sutton Memorial Park. The concurrency of MD 480 and MD 312 ends where the latter highway heads north into the center of town on Central Avenue. MD 480 heads east out of town, continuing straight through farmland. After traversing Forge Branch, the state highway veers to the northeast, paralleling the Choptank River at a distance until the highway enters Greensboro, where its name changes again to Main Street. MD 480 intersects MD 314 (Sunset Avenue) in the center of the town. The state highway traverses an S-curve and passes Greensboro Elementary School before reaching its northern terminus at MD 313 (Greensboro Road).  History  MD 480 was under construction from Ridgely to Greensboro by 1932 and completed in 1933. The state highway originally followed Central Avenue in Ridgely south from MD 312, then turned east onto Sixth Street toward Greensboro. In Greensboro, MD 480 had its eastern terminus at present-day MD 314. MD 480 north to its present eastern terminus and MD 314 east across the Choptank River were originally part of MD 313. When MD 313 bypassed Greensboro in 1950, MD 480 was extended north through Greensboro to its present terminus. When the Ridgely Cutoff was completed in 1953, MD 312 replaced MD 480 on Central Avenue. MD 480's western terminus was the intersection of Central Avenue and Sixth Street until MD 480 was extended west to MD 404 in Hillsboro in 1959.

It collapsed late in 2001. History Originally run by a volunteer organisation, during the late 1990s and early 2000s it ran a multitude of servers for popular multiplayer games of the time including: Counter-Strike, Half-Life, Quake, Quake II, Quake III, Starsiege: Tribes, Team Fortress and Unreal Tournament. The website and its multiplayer servers were launched in March 1998, having evolved from several 'clan' servers previously operated by the website's creators. Around the year 1999, it started offering a pay-per-use modem dial-up service and along with supporting the free multi- player services and website, propelled Barrysworld to being the 4th largest internet service provider (ISP) in the UK (based on call minutes per month). While the website and free multiplayer servers proved popular, with a claimed 300,000 registered users, the organisation behind the website struggled at times to find funds for the hardware and bandwidth required to support such a service. As cheap flat-rate narrow-band and broadband services from more mainstream ISPs became popular and the dot com crash made venture capitalists apprehensive about funding such organizations, Barrysworld once again struggled to find funds to support its activities. While the organisation tried to support the service by offering game servers and (non-compulsory) subscriptions, by 2001 the funding crisis had forced the organisation, which by now had 35 staff, into voluntary liquidation. The venture capital company 3i had provided ¬£1m, and guaranteed that a further ¬£2m would be forthcoming. The company GAME.net bought the website and its assets soon after, and for the next couple of years ran the website and multiplayer service in a similar manner, hoping the multiplayer service would promote its products. In 2003 the original creators of Barrysworld parted ways from the GAME.net company and relaunched the service supported by a volunteer based organisation using a new website http://www.freddyshouse.com .

The LA Auto Show is an OICA sanctioned international exhibition and also endorsed by the Greater Los Angeles New Car Dealers Association. It is open to the public for ten days each year, filling of exhibit space. The show begins with AutoMobility LA, a several day press showing. History The Los Angeles Auto Show began in 1907 with ninety-nine vehicles on display at Morley‚Äôs Skating Rink. In 1910, the event was held under a canvas big top at Fiesta Park. As the auto industry grew, the auto show changed venues four times throughout the 1920s to accommodate the growing needs of vendors. In 1926, it took place at the corner of Hill and Washington where it stayed for the next four years. During the 1929 show, a short circuit in one of the airplane exhibits caused a massive fire that destroyed the entire venue, resulting in over $1 million (approx. $15 million in 2019 dollars) worth of damages. There were no injuries. With the help of the community, the show reopened one day later at the Shrine Auditorium. The show continued to prove successful throughout the 1930s, but took a down turn during the Second World War and went on hiatus from 1940 through 1951. In 1952, the show re-opened at the Pan Pacific Auditorium with 152 vehicles on display, including those from international manufacturers. In 2006, the show moved its dates from early January to late November/early December, thus resulting in two shows during the year. The second 2006 event celebrated the show's centennial, despite its 100th year being 2007. AutoMobility LA In response to new technologies such as driver assist and cloud-based infotainment in the auto industry, the LA Auto Show organizers created the Connected Car Expo in 2013. The LA Auto Show begins with AutoMobility LA, four days catered to journalists, designers and industry representatives. In 2014, the show had 65 debuts, a record number. From 2013‚Äì2015, the first of three Press & Trade Days was devoted to the Connected Car Expo, a mingling affair for automotive and technology professionals. Connected Car Expo was merged with the show's Press & Trade days to create AutoMobility LA in 2016. For 2016, AutoMobility LA also included several events, with four days of networking, three days of breaking news, and two days of learning. The Press & Trade Days Kickoff Party was held for industry and media professionals the night before AutoMobility LA Conference.

It provides a platform for creating inquiry-based science projects for middle school and high school students to work collaboratively using evidence and resources from the Web. WISE inquiry projects are typically developed by teams including teachers, researchers, and scientists. These projects range in duration from 2 days to 4 weeks, suitable for teachers in every science topic at all grade levels. The use of Internet materials provides the foundation of WISE. All projects make use of some content from the World Wide Web, as well as additional Web pages authored for purposes of the project. This approach helps students learn to use the Internet for inquiry, critiquing Web sites, designing approaches, or comparing arguments. Typical projects engage students in designing solutions to problems (e.g. building a desert house that is warm at night and cool during the day), debating contemporary science controversies (e.g. the causes of declining amphibian populations), investigating scientific phenomena (e.g. thermal equilibrium in the classroom), or critiquing scientific claims found in web sites (e.g. arguments for life on Mars). WISE projects can also incorporate Java applets, flash models, forums to facilitate online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, branching, concept mapping and other built-in components. WISE is entirely browser-based, meaning that students only need access to a computer with an Internet connection, with no required software other than the Web browser). All student work is saved on central project servers that enable student accounts and teacher accounts to be coordinated, with special Web environments designed to support teachers and students. Students can access their work from any computer on the Internet. Teachers can choose from the library of curriculum projects in the WISE Teacher's Portal, each accompanied by a set of materials including a detailed lesson plan, pre and post assessments, connections to the AAAS National standards, tools for setting up a custom grading scheme, and even a software tool that enables customization of the WISE project for local issues, geographical features or student populations. Teachers can monitor and grade student work in real time, provide formative feedback during a project run, and manage their student accounts. Finally, WISE provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate the authoring of new projects, with numerous technology-based components including online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools. Developers can also include custom tools of their own design. Projects are further customizable by teachers and other end users through the same interface to better meet the needs of their students and constraints of local educational settings. The website provides rich descriptions of the WISE learning environment, a library of inquiry projects for students and teachers, a teacher support center, and the complete authoring environment.

He set the record as the highest points scorer in one game for Great Britain ‚Äì 32 points V Fiji in 1996. At the end of Super League's first season, Goulding was named at in the 1996 Super League Dream Team. He was the 1996 Great Britain Lions tour's top point scorer. Goulding was sent off in the 1997 Challenge Cup fourth round match against Wigan Warriors for a high tackle on Neil Cowie during February 1997. He initially received an eight-match ban, but this was reduced to six games following an appeal. On his return to the side, he helped St. Helens win the Challenge Cup final for the second consecutive year, kicking six goals in a 32‚Äì22 victory over the Bradford Bulls. In August 1997, he was stripped of the St. Helens' captaincy for disciplinary reasons, and replaced by Chris Joynt. Two weeks later, he was sent off for the second time in the season (on this occasion for a high tackle on Leeds Rhinos prop Jamie Mathiou) and was suspended for a further four games. Despite the controversies during the season, Goulding was selected to play for Great Britain at in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. In 1998, following further disciplinary problems, and the emergence of Sean Long as a replacement for St. Helens at , he moved to Huddersfield Giants on a free transfer. He went on to play for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and Salford City Reds before ending his career as a player-coach with Rochdale Hornets, with his final appearance as a player coming in 2005. On 1 June 2014, Goulding came out of playing retirement (after a nine-year break) to play in for Barrow Raiders in their Championship fixture against fellow strugglers Rochdale Hornets. Goulding played with number 3+4 on his back, because the number 7 squad number was taken by Barrow Raiders Liam Campbell. Goulding helped the team to only their second victory at that point all season and lifted Barrow Raiders off the bottom of the table. He was sent off for dissent in the next fixture against Doncaster, and received a five- match suspension for the incident. Coaching career He joined Rochdale Hornets initially as player-coach, and his playing career ended in 2005 after a biceps injury. He left his post at Rochdale Hornets in November 2005, citing frustration at the club's financial problems.

History Commissioned by Saudi Arabian businessman Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Abdulmalik Al-Sheikh, Pelorus was built at the L√ºrssen subsidiary repair shipyard in Schacht-Audorf Rendsburg, Germany. The conceptual design was completed in 1999, work began in 2000, and the yacht entered service in 2003. It was sold to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich during its maiden voyage, who had it altered by Blohm & Voss, adding a second helicopter pad (on top of the wheelhouse), two B&V; active fin stabilizers replaced by four zero-speed stabilizers, and modifications to the underwater exhaust, mast, and stern. Pelorus is powered by two W√§rtsil√§ (formerly Stork Werkspoor) 12v 26 engines designed to give continuous 3900 kW at 1000 r.p.m. On the builder's sea trial Pelorus successfully reached the contract speed of 20 knots, but often cruises between 12 and 14 knots. While owned by Abramovich, the yacht had a full-time crew of up to 46, in addition to a large security contingent that travelled with his family. Pelorus would cruise the western Mediterranean Sea during the summers, and commonly ventured down through the Suez Canal for the winters. In 2005, Abramovich lent Pelorus to Frank Lampard and John Terry for two weeks as a bonus for being the two best players at his English football club Chelsea F.C. the previous season, and allowed Terry to honeymoon with his new wife, Toni Poole, on the yacht in 2007. Irina Abramovich received the yacht in 2009 as part of her divorce settlement.

The bridge has five elliptical stone arches, and links Hart Street in Henley with White Hill (designated the A4130) leading up a steep hill to Remenham Hill. It crosses the Thames on the reach between Hambleden Lock and Marsh Lock, carrying the Thames Path across the river. It is a Grade I listed building. History This point of the Thames has been used for crossing since ancient times. The current bridge replaced an earlier wooden structure, the foundations of which can be seen in the basement of the Henley Royal Regatta headquarters nearby on the Berkshire side. However, the remains of two stone arches on both sides of the river indicate the existence of an even more ancient stone bridge prior to the timber structure. This bridge has been identified by some authors as the bridge which the Romans crossed pursuing the Britons in 43AD, as described by Dion Cassius. This hypothesis is refuted by many other authors.Cooke, p.45 The earliest recording of a bridge is in the Patent Rolls of 1232. In 1354, two granaries were leased on the bridge, which was timber on stone piers and several chapels are recorded. It was carried away in the great flood of 1774, but part of the eastern abutment is built on the intact easternmost span of the original 12th-century bridge. Present bridge Front view from upstream It was originally designed in 1781 by William Hayward of Shrewsbury, who died in 1782 before the construction of the bridge had begun.Ruddock, p.114A choice of walks from Henley along the River Thames into the Chiltern Hills.

Sculptures of Isis and Tamesis by Anne Seymour Damer are at the keystone of the central arch on each side of the bridge.Walpole, pp.550‚Äì1 Tamesis faces the north (downstream section of the bridge) and Isis the south (upstream section). The original models for these can be seen in the Henley Gallery at the nearby River and Rowing Museum. The cost of building the bridge was approximately ¬£10,000. =Damage and repair in 2010 and 2011= In August 2010 the bridge was damaged by a boat named Crazy Love. A ¬£200,000 repair programme commenced the following year =Battle of the bridge lights= Strings of white LED bulbs were attached to the Grade I listed crossing in March 2018 by artist Clive Hemsley. This was done without permission from the district and county councils and the artist was instructed to remove the lights. He claimed to have received scores of messages of support from people wanting the lights to remain permanently, including one from the Mayor of Henley. http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/henley-on-thames/123011/battle- of-the-bridge-lights.html Adjacent features Leander Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world,Leander Club: Home Page is also close to the bridge on the Berkshire side.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 50 (US 50) in Easton east to just north of MD 404 in West Denton. MD 328 connects Easton with Denton, passing through eastern Talbot County and a neck of land in Caroline County between the Choptank River and Tuckahoe Creek. MD 328 was constructed in Talbot County in the late 1910s between downtown Easton and a point west of Matthews. The state highway was constructed in Caroline County in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and was originally designated MD 457. The gap between the two highways was filled in the late 1940s and included a modern bridge over Tuckahoe Creek. MD 328's western terminus was moved to US 50 in the early 1960s. In West Denton, the highway was relocated and extended north to present MD 404 in the early 1980s. Route description View east along MD 328 in Matthews MD 328 begins at an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) in Easton. The roadway continues west on the opposite side of the intersection as Goldsborough Street toward downtown Easton. MD 328 heads northeast as Matthewstown Road, a two-lane undivided road that passes by residential subdivisions before entering farmland. After the intersection with Black Dog Alley, the state highway crosses Galloway Creek, Wootenaux Creek, and two unnamed tributaries of Kings Creek. MD 328 passes Ewing Airport, then crosses Beaverdam Branch before intersecting Lewistown Road in the hamlet of Matthews. A short distance east of Matthews, the state highway crosses Tuckahoe Creek on a bridge dedicated to Frederick Douglass. MD 328 continues into Caroline County as New Bridge Road, passing through farmland until the highway reaches West Denton. River Landing Road, the old alignment of MD 328 that approaches the Choptank River riverfront, splits to the northeast, while the state highway continues north past the Neck Meetinghouse and Yard to an intersection with MD 404 Business (Meeting House Road), which provides access to downtown Denton. MD 328 passes the other end of River Landing Road before reaching an intersection with the Denton bypass, MD 404 (Shore Highway). The state highway ends just north of the intersection with MD 404; River Road continues north as a county highway toward Ridgely. MD 328 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from US 50 in Easton to Black Dog Alley near Easton. History The first section of MD 328 was paved from Easton to a point just east of Wootenaux Creek by 1919. In addition, another section of present-day MD 328 was paved from MD 404 (now MD 404 Business) in West Denton southwest about by 1921. The Talbot County portion of the highway was extended to just west of Beaverdam Branch, about west of Matthews, by 1923. The Caroline County portion of the highway was extended southwest to Tuckahoe Creek in two sections in 1933 and 1935 and was designated MD 457. After World War II, construction began to fill the gap between the eastern end of MD 328 and the western end of MD 457. The new bridge over Tuckahoe Creek and the remainder of the highway were completed in 1947 and by 1948 the MD 328 designation was applied to the whole highway from Easton to Denton. By 1963, the western terminus had been rolled back from downtown Easton to US 50. In West Denton, MD 328 was moved to a new alignment in 1981 since the old alignment had been overpassed by MD 404's new bridge over the Choptank River in 1980. MD 328 was extended to its present terminus in 1985 ahead of the opening of the Denton bypass in 1987. A new bridge over Tuckahoe Creek was built immediately downstream from the former MD 328 bridge. The new bridge opened to traffic in October 2012.

American modernism is an artistic and cultural movement in the United States beginning at the turn of the 20th century, with a core period between World War I and World War II. Like its European counterpart, American modernism stemmed from a rejection of Enlightenment thinking, seeking to better represent reality in a new, more industrialized world.Singal, Daniel Joseph. \\"Towards a Definition of American Modernism\\". American Quarterly 39.1 (1987): 7‚Äì26. Web ... History Characteristically, modernist art has a tendency to abstraction, is innovative, aesthetic, futuristic and self-referential. It includes visual art, literature, music, film, design, architecture as well as life style. It reacts against historicism, artistic conventions and institutionalization of art. Art was not only to be dealt with in academies, theaters or concert halls, but to be included in everyday life and accessible for everybody. Furthermore, cultural institutions concentrated on fine art and scholars paid little attention to the revolutionary styles of modernism. Economic and technological progress in the U.S. during the Roaring Twenties gave rise to widespread utopianism, which influenced some modernist artists, while others were skeptical of the embrace of technology. The victory in World War I confirmed the status of the U.S. as an international player and gave the people self-confidence and a feeling of security. In this context, American modernism marked the beginning of American art as distinct and autonomous from European taste, by breaking artistic conventions that had been shaped after European traditions until then. American modernism benefited from the diversity of immigrant cultures. Artists were inspired by African, Caribbean, Asian and European folk cultures and embedded these exotic styles in their works. The Modernist American movement was a reflection of American life in the 20th century. In the quickly industrializing world and hastened pace of life, it was easy for the individual to be swallowed up by the vastness of things, left wandering, devoid of purpose. Social boundaries in race, class, sex, wealth and religion were being challenged. As the social structure was challenged by new incoming views, the bounds of traditional standards and social structure dissolved, and a loss of identity was what remained, translating eventually into isolation, alienation and an overall feeling of separateness from any kind of \\"whole\\". The unity of a war-rallied country was dying, along with it the illusion of the pleasantries it sold to its soldiers and people. The world was left violent, vulgar and spiritually empty. The middle class worker fell into a distinctly unnoticeable position, a cog much too small to hope to find recognition in a much greater machine. Citizens were overcome with their own futility. Youths' dreams shattered with failure and a disillusioning disappointment in recognition of limit and loss. The lives of the disillusioned and outcasts became more focal. Ability to define self through hard work and resourcefulness, to create your own vision of yourself without the help of traditional means, became prized. Some authors endorsed this, while others, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, challenged how alluring but destructively false the values of privilege can be. Modernist America had to find common ground in a world no longer unified in belief. The unity found lay in the common ground of the shared consciousness within all human experience. The importance of the individual was emphasized; the truly limited nature of the human experience formed a bond across all bridges of race, class, sex, wealth or religion. Society, in this way, found shared meaning, even in disarray. Some see modernism in the tradition of 19th century aestheticism and the \\"art for art's sake\\" movement. Clement Greenberg argues that modernist art excludes \\"anything outside itself\\". Others see modernist art, for example in blues and jazz music, as a medium for emotions and moods, and many works dealt with contemporary issues, like feminism and city life. Some artists and theoreticians even added a political dimension to American modernism. American modernist design and architecture enabled people to lead a modern life. Work and family life changed radically and rapidly due to the economic upswing during the 1920s. In the U.S., the car became popular and affordable for many, leisure time and entertainment gained importance and the job market opened up for women. In order to make life more efficient, designers and architects aimed at the simplification of housework. The Great Depression at the end of the '20s and during the '30s disillusioned people about the economic stability of the country and eroded utopianist thinking. The outbreak and the terrors of World War II caused further changes in mentality. The Post-war period that followed was termed Late Modernism. The Postmodernist era was generally considered characteristic of the art of the late 20th century beginning in the 1980s.

It was the time when the first cubist landscapes, still-life and portraits appeared; bright colors entered the palettes of painters, and the first non-objective paintings were displayed in the galleries. The modernist movement during the formative years was also becoming popular in New York City by 1913 at the popular Manhattan studio gallery of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong (1878‚Äì1962) and through the work of the Whitney Studio Cub in 1918.The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, , Professor Emeritus James K. Kettlewell: Harvard, Skidmore College, Curator The Hyde Collection. Foreword to The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm: , According to Davidson, the beginning of American modernist painting can be dated to the 1910s. The early part of the period lasted 25 years and ended around 1935, when modern art was referred to as, what Greenberg called the avant-garde. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City displayed the contemporary work of European artists, as well as Americans. The Impressionist, Fauvist and Cubist paintings startled many American viewers who were accustomed to more conventional art. However, inspired by what they saw, many American artists were influenced by the radical and new ideas. The early 20th century was marked by the exploration of different techniques and ways of artistic expressiveness. Many American artists like Wilhelmina Weber, Man Ray, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and others went to Europe, notably Paris, to make art. The formation of various artistic assemblies led to the multiplicity of meaning in the visual arts. The Ashcan School gathered around realism (Robert Henri or George Luks); the Stieglitz circle glorified abstract visions of New York City (Max Weber, Abraham Walkowitz); color painters evolved in direction of the colorful, abstract \\"synchromies\\" (Stanton Macdonald-Wright and Morgan Russell), whereas precisionism visualized the industrialized landscape of America in the form of sharp and dynamic geometrization (Joseph Stella, Charles Sheeler, Morton Livingston Schamberg and Charles Demuth). Eventually artists like Charles Burchfield, Marsden Hartley, Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe who was thought of as the mother of American Modernism, John Marin, Arthur Beecher Carles, Alfred Henry Maurer, Andrew Dasburg, James Daugherty, John Covert, Henrietta Shore, William Zorach, Marguerite Thompson (Zorach), Manierre Dawson, Arnold Friedman and Oscar Bluemner ushered in the era of Modernism to the New York School. The shift of focus and multiplicity of subjects in the visual arts is also a hallmark of American modernist art. Thus, for example, the group The Eight brought the focus on the modern city, and placed emphasis on the diversity of different classes of citizens. Two of the most significant representatives of The Eight, Robert Henri and John Sloan made paintings about social diversity, often taking as a main subject the slum dwellers of industrialized cities. The late 1920s and the 1930s belonged (among many others) to two movements in American painting, Regionalism and Social Realism. The regionalists focused on the colorfulness of the American landscape and the complexities of country life, whereas the social realists went into the subjects of the Great Depression, poverty, and social injustice. The social realists protested against the government and the establishment that appeared hypocritical, biased, and indifferent to the matters of human inequalities. Abstraction, landscape and music were popular modernist themes during the first half of the 20th century. Artists like Charles Demuth who created his masterpiece I Saw The Figure Five in Gold in 1928, Morton Schamberg (1881‚Äì1918) and Charles Sheeler were closely related to the Precisionist movement as well. Sheeler typically painted cityscapes and industrial architecture as exemplified by his painting Amoskeag Canal 1948. Jazz and music were improvisationally represented by Stuart Davis, as exemplified by Hot Still-Scape for Six Colors ‚Äì 7th Avenue Style, from 1940. Modernism bridged the gap between the art and a socially diverse audience in the U.S. A growing number of museums and galleries aimed at bringing modernity to the general public. Despite initial resistance to the celebration of progress, technology, and urban life, the visual arts contributed enormously to the self-consciousness and awareness of the American people. New modernist painting shined a light on the emotional and psychic states of the audience, which was fundamental to the formation of an American identity. Numerous directions of American \\"modernism\\" did not result in one coherent style, but evoked the desire for experiments and challenges. It proved that modern art goes beyond fixed principles. =Main schools and movements of American modernism= * the Stieglitz group * the Arensberg circle * color painters * Precisionism * the Independents * the Philadelphia school * New York independents * Chicago and westward Modernist painting Georgia O'Keeffe, known as the \\"Mother of American modernism\\", has been a major figure in American Modernism since the 1920s. She has received widespread recognition, for challenging the boundaries of modern American artistic style. She is chiefly known for paintings of flowers, rocks, shells, animal bones and landscapes in which she synthesized abstraction and representation. Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills, from 1935 is a well known painting by O'Keeffe. Georgia O'Keeffe, Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills, 1935 Arthur Dove, Me and the Moon 1937 Arthur Dove used a wide range of media, sometimes in unconventional combinations to produce his abstractions and his abstract landscapes. Me and the Moon from 1937 is a good example of an Arthur Dove abstract landscape and has been referred to as one of the culminating works of his career. Dove did a series of experimental collage works in the 1920s. He also experimented with techniques, combining paints like hand mixed oil or tempera over a wax emulsion. African-American painter Aaron Douglas (1899‚Äì1979) is one of the best-known and most influential African-American modernist painters. His works contributed strongly to the development of an aesthetic movement that is closely related to distinct features of African- American heritage and culture. Douglas influenced African-American visual arts especially during the Harlem Renaissance. One of Douglas' most popular paintings is The Crucifixion. It was published in James Weldon Johnson's God's Trombones in 1927. The crucifixion scene that is depicted in the painting shows several elements that constitute Douglas' art: clear-cut delineation, change of shadows and light, stylized human bodies and geometric figures as concentric circles in contrast to linear forms. The painting's theme resembles not only the biblical scene but can also be seen as an allusion to African- American religious tradition: the oversized, dark Jesus is bearing his cross, his eyes directed to heaven from which light is cast down onto his followers. Stylized Roman soldiers are flanking the scene with their pointed spears. As a result, the observer is reminded for instance of the African-American gospel tradition but also of a history of suppression. Beauford Delaney, Charles Alston, Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden were also important African-American Modernist painters that inspired generations of artists that followed them. Modernist photography Rrose S√©lavy (Marcel Duchamp). 1921. Photograph by Man Ray. Art Direction by Marcel Duchamp. At the beginning of American modernism, photography still struggled to be recognized as a form of art. The photographer Alfred Stieglitz described it as: \\"Artists who saw my earlier photographs began to tell me that they envied me; that they felt my photographs were superior to their paintings, but that, unfortunately, photography was not an art. I could not understand why the artists should envy me for my work, yet, in the same breath, decry it because it was machine- made.\\" (Stieglitz:8). In 1902, Stieglitz founded the Photo-Secession group with members such as Edward Steichen, Gertrude K√§sebier and Clarence Hudson White, which had the objective of raising the standard and increasing the awareness of art photography. At that point, their main style was pictorialist, which was known for modifying photos through soft focus, special filters or exotic printing processes, to imitate the style of paintings and etchings of that time. For means of publication, Stieglitz, as the driving force of the movement, started the magazine Camera Work, in which he published artists he felt represented the movement. He also ran three galleries one after another, namely \\"291\\" (1905‚Äì1917), \\"The Intimate Gallery\\" (1925‚Äì1929) and \\"An American Place\\" (1929‚Äì1947). Especially 291 served as a meeting point for artists and writers and was the first to exhibit the early modernist art works of European artists, such as Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, Henri Rousseau, Paul C√©zanne, and Pablo Picasso, in the United States. A further link to the European avant-garde was established by Man Ray. Born in America and inspired by the work he saw in Stieglitz' galleries, Ray emigrated to Paris in 1921 and together with artists of the European Dada and Surrealist movements created new photographic techniques such as rayographs (placing objects directly on photosensitive paper). In the early 1920s, photographers moved towards what they called straight photography. In contrast to the pictorialist style, they now rejected any kind of manipulation in the photographic process (e.g., soft lens, special developing or printing methods) and tried to use the advantages of the camera as a unique medium for capturing reality. Their motifs were supposed to look as objective as possible. Turning the focus away from classic portraiture and the pictorialist style, the photographers started using their pictures as means for representing the harsh realities of everyday life, but at the same time tried to search for the beauty in the detail or the overall aesthetical structure. Machines and factory work, sky scrapers and technical innovations became prominent motifs. In 1932 some younger photographers (e.g. Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke, Edward Weston) started Group f/64 based on the ideals of straight photography, which became the most progressive association of its time. American modernist literature American modernist literature was a dominant trend in American literature between World War I and World War II. The modernist era highlighted innovation in the form and language of poetry and prose, as well as addressing numerous contemporary topics, such as race relations, gender and the human condition. Many American modernists became expatriated in Europe during this time, often becoming stalwarts in the European movement, as was the case for T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. These writers were often known as The Lost Generation.Ward, David, and David C. Ward. \\"Lighting Out for the Territories: American Expatriates, Paris, and Modernism\\". The Sewanee Review 105.3 (1997): 423‚Äì427. Web ... As a reaction to this trend, many American authors and poets began a trend of 'nativism', seeking to represent the modern American experience in America. Notable contributors to this trend include William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore. These poets were often critical of the works of expatriate writers such as Eliot and Pound, as evidenced by poems like Spring and All. Influenced by the first World War, many American modernist writers explored the psychological wounds and spiritual scars of the war experience. The economic crisis in America at the beginning of the 1930s also left a mark on literature, such as John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. A related issue is the loss of self and need for self-definition, as workers faded into the background of city life, unnoticed cogs within a machine yearning for self- definition. American modernists echoed the mid-19th-century focus on the attempt to \\"build a self\\"‚Äîa theme illustrated by Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Madness and its manifestations seems to be another favorite modernist theme, as seen in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones, Hemingway's The Battler and Faulkner's That Evening Sun. Nevertheless, all these negative aspects led to new hopes and aspirations, and to the search for a new beginning, not only for the contemporary individuals, but also for the fictional characters in American modernist literature. Modernist literature also allowed for the development of regional trends within American literature, including the Harlem Renaissance and southern modernism. The Harlem Renaissance marked a rebirth for African American arts, centralized in the Harlem area of New York. Writers and thinkers such as Alain Locke, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston were among the key figures of the movement. The movement was connected to a vogue for African American culture, as seen too in the popularity of Jazz music, with many writers financed by white patrons. Many writers of this movement used modernist techniques to represent African American life, for instance incorporating the rhythms of Jazz music and dialects of African American culture into poetry and prose. Southern modernism similarly represented the life and unique experiences of the South using modernist aesthetics, with celebrated figures including William Faulkner and Tennessee Williams. =The new criticism in America= From the 1930s to the 1960s, New Criticism became a critical force in the United States. It was the most powerful perspective in American literary criticism. The representatives were John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, Robert Penn Warren. \\"The influential critical methods these poet-professors developed emphasized the sharpening of close reading skills. New Criticism privileged the evaluation of poetry as the justification of literary scholarship\\". Brooks and Warren's Understanding Poetry (1938) became one of the most influential college poetry textbooks of the 1930s and was revised and reprinted well into the 1970s. (Morrisson: 29). New criticism showed itself in such works as Eliot's and Yeats' poems. \\"Poetry that best fit the aesthetic criteria of the New Critics was emphasized in important classroom teaching anthologies\\" (Morrisson: 29). T. S. Eliot redefined tradition in his essay \\"Tradition and the Individual Talent\\". He formulated such critical concepts as \\"objective correlative\\", and rethought the literary canon in his elevation of Jacobean drama and metaphysical poetry. His work had a fundamental influence on New Criticism in America. Architecture and space The United States played a great role in the modernism movement concerning new advanced building and construction technologies. Among construction innovations there are such materials as iron, steel and reinforced concrete. Brooklyn Bridge by John and Washington Roebling (1869‚Äì1883) (for more details see John Roebling/Washington Roebling) Louis Henry Sullivan headed the so-called Chicago school of architecture, which was distinct by its development of functional design along with modern materials. Sullivan's follower Frank Lloyd Wright absorbed from his 'lieber Master' (dear master) the German romantic tradition of organic architecture. He developed a new and original approach to residential design before World War I, which became known as the \\"prairie style.\\" It combined open planning principles with horizontal emphasis, asymmetrical facade elevations, and broad, sheltering roofs. Robie House in Chicago (1909) and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City (1946‚Äì59) are two of his seminal works. In his works Wright moved closer and closer to an earth-bound sense of natural form, using rough-hewn stone and timber and aiming always in his houses to achieve an effect of intimate and protective shelter. Foreign-born architects as Richard Neutra, Rudolf Schindler, and William Lescaze during the 1920s played a great role in development of American architecture performing later a style, which got the name of international style and was reflected in the design of corporate office buildings after World War II. Such buildings as Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Lever House (1952) and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building (1956‚Äì58) in New York City are the examples of this new style. When such famous Europeans as Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe immigrated to the United States, many American architectural schools went under the influence of the traditions of the Bauhaus in Germany.

Known for most of its length as St. Margarets Road, the highway runs from MD 648 near Annapolis east to the end of state maintenance in Cape St. Claire. MD 179 serves a suburban area near the southern end of the Broadneck Peninsula of northeastern Anne Arundel County. The state highway was paved in the 1920s from its western end to Skidmore near Sandy Point. MD 179 was truncated at what is now U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301 when their predecessor highway replaced the stretch to Skidmore in the early 1940s. MD 179 was extended into Cape St. Claire in the early 1990s. Route description View west along MD 179 near US 50/301 near Cape St. Claire MD 179 begins at an intersection with MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) east of Annapolis. The state highway heads northeast as two-lane undivided St. Margarets Road, which crosses Mill Creek and passes through the hamlet of St. Margaret's, the site of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church. At Holly Drive, which is unsigned MD 931L, MD 179 expands to a two-lane divided highway with auxiliary lanes. The highway has an intersection with Buschs Frontage Road and Whitehall Road, which are unsigned MD 908A and MD 908C, respectively. Buschs Frontage Road leads to ramps to and from eastbound US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). MD 179 receives a ramp from the eastbound freeway immediately before it crosses over the freeway, then intersects ramps to and from westbound US 50 and US 301. The highway continues northeast as Cape St. Claire Road and intersects College Parkway, which is unsigned MD 931Q. MD 179 reduces to a two-lane undivided road for the final stretch before its eastern terminus at an arbitrary spot between Woodland Circle, which is unsigned MD 931U, and Forest Terrace. Cape St. Claire Road continues as a county highway into the center of the namesake community at the mouth of the Magothy River. History MD 179 was constructed from the Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard (later MD 2 and now MD 648) east to St. Margarets in 1920. The highway was extended to the site of the US 50 interchange in 1928. MD 179 was extended east to Skidmore, a hamlet just west of what is today Sandy Point State Park, in 1929 and 1930. Between 1942 and 1944, a ferry terminal was constructed at Sandy Point as the new western end of the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry. A highway was constructed from MD 2 east to the new terminal along the alignment of the modern US 50 freeway.

From Texas Tech (then Texas Technological College, now Texas Tech University), Anderson was the first-round draft pick of the Green Bay Packers in the 1965 NFL draft, the seventh overall selection. That year's draft included future hall-of- famers Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, Joe Namath, and Fred Biletnikoff. Early years Born in Borger, Texas, Anderson grew up in Stinnett, seat of Hutchinson County in the Texas Panhandle, and graduated from Stinnett High School in 1961. A talented multi-sport athlete, he was all-state in football and basketball, placed in the state track meet (hurdles and relay) and played baseball in the summer. College career At Texas Tech in Lubbock, Anderson earned the nickname the \\"Golden Palomino\\". He received All-American honors twice (1964 and 1965) and was a three-time all-Southwest Conference halfback (1963‚Äì65). Anderson held many of Texas Tech's football records and finished fourth in the 1965 Heisman Trophy race. He is part of the Texas Tech Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. Because of a redshirt year due to academic issues, Anderson was eligible as underclassman for the 1965 NFL Draft, then known as a \\"future\\" pick. In 1964, he ran for 966 yards with three touchdowns (TDs) and had 32 catches for 396 yards and four TDs; Despite being selected by the Packers, he returned for his senior season at Texas Tech in 1965 and led the Red Raiders to an 8-2 regular season and a berth in the Gator Bowl on the afternoon of New Year's Eve. As a senior, he ran for 705 yards with 10 TDs and had 60 catches for 797 yards and seven TDs. Selected the outstanding player for Texas Tech in a 10-point loss to Georgia Tech, Anderson signed his professional football contract hours after the game. He selected the Packers over the reportedly higher offer from the Houston Oilers of the AFL. His contract was believed to be a then-record $600,000, exceeding Joe Namath's contract of the previous year. Professional career Anderson began his NFL career in 1966 as #44 for the world-champion Packers. Fellow All- American Jim Grabowski, a fullback from Illinois, was the Packers' first pick in the 1966 NFL Draft, and ninth overall. The well-paid pair were the projected successors of Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor, future hall of famers in their final season with Green Bay. The two rookies were on the College All- Star team that lost to the defending NFL champion Packers 38‚Äì0 on August 5 at Soldier Field in Chicago. They joined the Packers' training camp after the game, and were tabbed the \\"Gold Dust Twins.\\" Though he did not see much playing time as a rookie, he was part of a memorable play. During his second carry in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl I, Anderson's knee knocked out Chiefs defensive back Fred \\"The Hammer\\" Williamson, who had been boastful in pregame interviews. Williamson was carried off on a stretcher. After six seasons in Green Bay under three head coaches, Anderson was traded in February to the St. Louis Cardinals for Anderson played through the 1974 season with the Cardinals, then was traded to the Miami Dolphins in the offseason. At age 32, he recognized that his prospects for playing time were low, and retired during training camp in =Punter= While with the Packers under head coach Vince Lombardi, Anderson originated the concept of hang time in punting. Until Anderson, punters typically strove for maximum distance, with the NFL's leaders usually averaging 45 or more yards a punt. Punt returns varied, with an average of perhaps 5 yards per return. In 1967, the left-footed Anderson worked instead at punting the ball higher, shortening the distance traveled, but increasing the ball's time in the air, allowing better coverage by his team on the punt return. Green Bay punted 66 times that year, 63 of them by Anderson; opponents were able to return only 13 of them for a total of 22 yards, or about one-third yard (one foot) per punt. Lombardi explained the concept to sportswriters who questioned why he did not try to find a better punter than Anderson, who averaged only 36.6 yards per punt that year. Lombardi pointed out the lack of return yardage. Other punters soon followed Anderson, working for greater hang time. Eventually, the NFL changed its rules governing punt coverage, to restore the ability to return punts. After football Following his retirement from the NFL, Anderson spent nearly two decades on the celebrity golf tour. As of 2017, Anderson lives in the Dallas area and stays busy with 10 grandchildren and his Dallas-based foundation, Winners for Life, that helps send at-risk kids to college.

It is an inactive volcanic mountain range with the highest point being Crow Peak at , right next to Elkhorn Peak, . The range is surrounded by the cities of Helena, Montana City, Townsend, Whitehall, and Boulder and is part of the Helena National Forest in Montana's Jefferson County. Geology Late Cretaceous paleogeographic map of the United States, showing Elkhorn volcanoes in the northwestThe rocks of the Elkhorns were formed about 74 to 81 million years ago (Late Cretaceous time) as a result of the Farallon tectonic plate subducting beneath western North America and allowing magma to rise to the surface. The Elkhorn Mountains Volcanics are extrusive rocks related to the plutonic granites of the Boulder Batholith. Volcanic flows, lahars, and ash falls from sources in the Elkhorn Mountains reach as far as Choteau, Montana, but the thickest deposits lie within a radius of about from the Elkhorns. The volcanics probably originally covered an area of about . Mineral deposits associated with the Elkhorn Mountains Volcanics include those mined at Elkhorn, Montana, now a ghost town, and gold at the Golden Sunlight Mine near Whitehall, which is associated with a breccia pipe in the volcanics. The mountain range seen today is related to regional structural uplift dating mostly to Oligocene time. The Land South face of the Elkhorns as seen from outside Boulder, Montana. A forest fire in 1988 burned 47,000 acres (190 km¬≤) of the mountain range, leaving carpets of seedlings growing into new lodgepole pine forests. The land has been used extensively in the past for gold and silver mining, logging, and open range grazing, leaving a noticeable impact; most notably the abandoned mining town of Elkhorn. Recently with efforts conducted by the BLM, Montana FWP and Helena National Forest, new conservation and wildlife management plans have been put into place including big horn sheep reintroduction and the westslope cutthroat trout restoration program. Management of the 2000+ elk herd in the area and the suppression of noxious weeds is also an ongoing task. Despite the impacts of mining, around 100,000 acres of the Elkhorns were still roadless in 1992; this included 85,000 acres of roadless National Forest land as well as adjacent BLM, state and private lands. Congress designated 175,000 acres of the range as the \\"Elkhorns Wildlife Management Area,\\" and one of Montana's most productive elk herds inhabits the range. Because the Elkhorns are higher in elevation than the nearby section of the Continental Divide, they catch more moisture than do most other ranges east of the Divide. For this reason, the Elkhorns are especially diverse, with 148 documented vertebrate species.

Her contributions through her field work, academic monologues and archeological excavation discoveries are vast and have contributed to continued scientific discoveries. Corvinus‚Äô work gained professional recognition prior to her tragic murder that took place in her home in Pune, India, on 7 January 2006.  Early and personal life  Corvinus was born in Stettin, then part of Weimar Germany, in 1932. She spent most of her early years in Germany. As a child, Corvinus was fond of many things including people, cultures, music, travelling, and different scientific disciplines. She was known to be friendly and humble. Throughout her life, Corvinus had many friends. After they met in 1975, Corvinus and Ulla (Ursula) Musgnug had been close friends throughout their lives. Musgnug was also a trained anthropologist working through the Cape Town University. She has lived in the United States, Germany, and South Africa. Corvinus and Musgnug remained good friends despite their world travels. Corvinus had named Musgnug her legal heir, thus after Corvinus‚Äô death, Musgnug inherited her works, such as photographs, slides and books. Musgnug has donated many items and works with the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education in India to keep the legacy of Gudrun Corvinus alive.  Education and career  Corvinus was born in Stettin, then part of Weimar Germany, in 1932. She studied geology, vertebrate paleontology and Palaeolithic archaeology at the University of Bonn, and completed her doctoral dissertation on Jurassic Ammonites from France. Her focus shifted to Paleolithic archaeology after her doctoral dissertation. Later in her career she was affiliated with the University of T√ºbingen where she studied geology, paleontology and prehistory. After marrying a man from Pune, Corvinus became interested in the geology and prehistory of India, which became the main focus of her research associated with Deccan College. At Deccan College she established foundational associations and ties with numerous mentors and colleagues. She received a research fellowship from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Delhi) for a project entitled Early Man in India. Corvinus also worked in Africa, being part of the original Afar Research Expedition team with Donald Johnson that discovered Lucy, a female hominin belonging to Australopithecus afarensis, and other prehistoric hominin sites in Ethiopia. While in Ethiopia, Corvinus also found 2.6 million year old artefacts. Corvinus was the first person responsible for discovering Paleolithic sites there that turned out to be among the oldest archaeological evidence in the world, which few are aware of. Gudrun was not recognized immediately following her work and was not credited for her contribution towards her field due to the fact that she tended to work alone and not many people knew she was even part of the Afar Research Expedition Team. Corvinus received belated professional recognition. She left the group not long after the discovery of Lucy due to both political issues in Ethiopia and social issues within the group. After discontinuing her work with the Afar Research Expedition, Corvinus worked for De Beers as a Senior Geologist in Namibia diamond mines during the 1970s up to 1980. Her job included locating diamond deposits as well as fossil-bearing Miocene sediments along the coast of Namibia. It was here where she not only found fossils that dated back to 18 million years ago, but also many Paleolithic artefacts. While in Namibia and South Africa, Gudrun worked as a geologist, archaeologist and even spent some time as a tour guide. After discovering many things in Africa, in 1984 Gudrun decided to move to Nepal where she researched for 20 years in the Siwalik Mountain Ranges and was able to do so by funding from the German Research Foundation.  Research in India  Gudrun started her scientific career studying Jurassic ammonites from France, but later shifted to Palaeolithic archaeology. In 1964, Corvinus examined the Pravara drainage system in the Nevasa area of Maharashtra through an independent multi-disciplinary project. After a survey on the geomorphology of the entire Pravara Valley, suggested by H.D. Sankalia, Corvinus came across the Archeulian factory site at the junction of Chirki with the Pravara, 2 miles downstream from Nevasa. After being funded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Research Council), she decided to excavate the site, which lasted 3 winter seasons from 1966‚Äì1969. The lengthy excavation resulted in the revelation of rich Early Archeulian assemblage in fine-grained context in the gullies of Chirki area. Besides this, a great number of well-preserved fossil wood pieces, faunal specimens, and tree trunks were found in the alluvium. In 1981, Corvinus published her first classic monograph, ‚ÄúA Survey of the Pravara River System in Western Maharashtra, India‚Äù. Her second monograph, ‚ÄúA Survey of the Pravara River System in Western Maharashtra, India‚Äù was published in 1983. This makes her the first to publish monographs on the geology and archaeology of an Archaeulian site in the entire Indian subcontinent. These monographs are still highly renowned and her data has continued to be utilized in geologic work to this day. In 1985, following her work at Chirki-on-Neval (India), Gudrun Corvinus began explorations in the foothills of Siwalik Hills of Western Nepal. In the span of twelve years (1988-2006), she was rewarded with findings and discoveries of numerous Paleolithic sites and rich faunal and floral assemblages ranging from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. The discovery of an unexpected wealth of occupation sites from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic were found in the Dun Valleys of Dang-Deokhuri District in the Siwalik Hills, and an area along the Rato River in East Nepal. From a sandstone succession near Rato Khola, Corvinus discovered the skull of Archidiskodon planifrons. Evidence of hand axe indicate human occupation can be dated back at least the late Middle Pleistocene. Most significantly, her finding of the Acheulian sites demonstrates that despite the scarce materials, the early South Asian Acheulian hominins were able to cross the vast Indo- Gangetic floodplain.  Murder  On 7 January 2006, Corvinus was discovered by the Bund Garden police stabbed and beheaded in her apartment in Pune. Gudrun had not been seen since December 30. The police were called when her friends could not get a hold of her by phone and she wouldn't answer her door. She was later identified by her passport. Her head was recovered from the riverbed near the Kharadi bridge. Fakir Mohammed Shaikh, a 27-year-old real estate agent, was arrested within seven hours after Corvinus‚Äô decapitated body was found. He was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life in prison and a Rs 11,000 fine. He was also found guilty of destroying evidence and theft, carrying a sentence of seven years and three years of rigorous imprisonment respectively. The public prosecutor of the case, Neelima Vartak, stated that she was murdered for her property. Corvinus' ashes were scattered in the Western Ghats. Gudrun Corvinus has been featured since her death for her significant contributions to the scientific community by various geological and archaeological organizations.  Selected publications  *1968.

Hull appeared in 74 films between 1917 and 1966, often playing supporting characters like the uncle of Tyrone Power's love interest Nancy Kelly in Jesse James (1939). He appeared as Charles Rittenhouse, a wealthy industrialist in Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944). Other notable roles were as Abel Magwitch in the 1934 version of Great Expectations and in the last film of director Tod Browning, Miracles for Sale (1939). He starred in Werewolf of London in 1935. Hull memorably portrayed a doctor who Humphrey Bogart goes to for help in High Sierra, then also was cast in Colorado Territory, a western remake of the High Sierra story that starred Joel McCrea. He played a desert prospector who comes to Robert Ryan's rescue in Inferno in 1953. He guest starred on CBS's Appointment with Adventure, John Payne's NBC western series, The Restless Gun, and the syndicated crime drama, U.S. Marshal. In 1958, he was featured in Robert Culp's western series, Trackdown as \\"Moss\\" in episode \\"Three Legged Fox\\". In 1960, Hull appeared on Bonanza twice: in the episode \\"The Gunmen\\" as Sheriff B. Banneman and he portrayed a scout for General John Charles Fremont (who, in real life, was the grandfather of Hull's wife) in the episode \\"The Mission\\". On December 13, 1960, Hull guest-starred on NBC's Laramie as an embittered rancher, Ben Parkinson, who challenges Slim Sherman, played by series star John Smith, to a duel after Parkinson's youngest son accidentally kills himself on Sherman ranch land. Ron Harper portrays Parkinson's other son, Tom. Hull also guest- starred in the series finale of Laramie, the episode \\"The Road to Helena\\" (May 21, 1963). Series character Slim Sherman, while in Cody, Wyoming, is hired by David Franklin, played by Hull, and his barmaid daughter, Ruth, portrayed by Maggie Pierce, to guide the pair to Helena, Montana, so that Franklin can return money that he had previously stolen. John M. Pickard also appears in this episode. Hull's last film was The Chase (1966) with Marlon Brando and Robert Redford. Family Hull was married to Juliet Van Wyck Fremont from 1913 until her death in 1971. She was a granddaughter of Civil War general and explorer John C. Fr√©mont and Jessie Ann Benton, the daughter of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton. The couple had three children, Henry Jr., Shelley; named after Henry's late brother) and Joan. When his wife died in 1971, Hull went to Britain to spend his last years with his daughter. He died in Cornwall at his daughter's residence on March 8, 1977. Hull had two brothers who were also actors. Shelley Hull was a popular leading man, who died in 1919 during the Spanish influenza epidemic. Shelley's wife, Josephine Hull, was an Oscar- winning character actress. Hull's other brother, Howard, the eldest brother, was also an actor. He was married, until his death in 1937, to stage star Margaret Anglin. Henry Hull was quoted as saying he owed all his dramatic training to Anglin, with whom he had acted on stage.

A photo book is related to and also often used as a coffee table book. Henry Bond's 1998 photo-book The cult of the street Early Early photo books are characterized by their use of photographic printing as part of their reprographic technology. Photographic prints were tipped-in rather than printed directly onto the same paper stock used for letterpress printed text. Many early titles were printed in very small editions and were released as partworks to a network of well-informed and privileged readers. Few original examples of these books survive today, due to their vulnerability to light and damage caused by frequent handling. What is arguably the first photo book, Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions (1843-1853) was created by Anna Atkins. The book was released as a partwork to assist the scientific community in the identification of marine specimens. The non-silver cyanotype printing process worked by pressing actual specimens in contact with light- sensitive paper; hence the word \\"impression\\" in the book's title. The Pencil of Nature (1844-46) was produced by William Henry Fox Talbot, who had invented the Calotype photographic process in 1839. Although significant as the first negative/positive photography process, the Calotype was also envisioned as a commercial prospect for the reproduction of images in books through mass publication. Anticipating commercial success, Fox Talbot established purpose- made printing premises in Reading to carry out the reproduction of his book. The Pencil of Nature was released in six parts between 1844 and 1846, to an initially promising list of private subscribers whose numbers dwindled, causing the premature termination of his project. Julia Margaret Cameron created the first photo book to illustrate a literary work. The 1874 edition of Tennyson's Idylls of the King contained twelve Cameron images that had been specially created, but reproduced as wood engravings. Cameron sought her own publisher, creating a new version of Idylls of the King, containing her original photographs as albumen prints, which came out in December of the same year. Japanese Some photo books by Buk≈ç Shimizu Photographers such as Shinz≈ç Fukuhara were producing photography books in the 1920s. The postwar years brought low-priced photography books, such as the many volumes of Iwanami Shashin Bunko magazine. From the 1950s onward, most Japanese photographers of note have had photo books published. The simplest Japanese translation of photo book is shashinsh≈´ (), and the shashinsh≈´ section of a typical Japanese bookstore displays books of photographs with various levels of documentary or artistic merit. They primarily portray currently popular celebrities in a variety of settings and outfits. Many are of cheesecake models (guradoru), or porn starlets (n≈´doru); others are of singers, television personalities, professional sportswomen (often wrestlers) and so forth. One of the best selling Japanese photobooks of all time, Santa Fe (1991), a fine art nude photo book modelled by Rie Miyazawa and photographed by Kishin Shinoyama, sold 1.5 million copies in the early 1990s.http://photoguide.jp/txt/Shinoyama_Kishin  Personalized  Storing digital images in traditional photo albums means printed copies are inserted in the pages of an album. Companies allow users to create personalized photo books. The resulting book is printed on digital color printers and case bound. Professional printing and binding services offer easy creation of photo books with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated design and order workflow, hardcover bound books with customized pictures and text can be produced very cost-effectively. Currently there are many photo book software companies who sell licensed solutions to photo labs and print houses so that their customers can create photo books (and other photo related paraphernalia) with ease. These software solutions are available for free download or online access or through apps. Online The development of digital cameras and the Internet allowed an enormous production and exchange of pictures, taken from different corners of the globe. There are many possibilities nowadays for users to upload and share pictures (examples are Google and Facebook). However, many people and institutions also publish 'photo books' on the web, by providing the community with a huge web database freely available for everybody.

Once described as a 'female genius' by Horace Walpole, she was trained in sculpture by Giuseppe Ceracchi and John Bacon. Influenced by the Enlightenment movement, Anne was an author, traveller, theatrical producer and actress, as well as an acclaimed sculptress. She exhibited regularly at The Royal Academy from 1784 to 1818. She was a close friend to members of Georgian high society, including Horace Walpole and the Whig politician Charles James Fox. It is believed that Damer was a lesbian and was in a relationship with the actress Elizabeth Farren. Life Anne Conway was born in Sevenoaks into an aristocratic Whig family. She was the only daughter of Field-Marshal Henry Seymour Conway (1721‚Äì1795) and his wife Caroline Bruce, born Campbell, Lady Ailesbury (1721‚Äì1803). Her father was a nephew of Robert Walpole, Britain's first prime minister. Walpole's son, Horace Walpole was her godfather, and Anne spent much of her childhood in his home in Strawberry Hill. Her mother was the daughter of the Duke of Argyll. She was brought up at the family home at Park Place, Remenham, Berkshire. She was highly educated and taught at home. By the time she was seventeen, she was introduced into society. In 1766 at the age of 17, she was sketched by Angelica Kaufmann in the character of the goddess Ceres. The work which can be found in St Mary's University Twickenham. In 1800, an unknown artist (possibly Kauffman) completed a painting with the same composition as the sketch. The painting preceded her launch into Society and her entrance onto the marriage market. In 1767 she married John Damer, the son of Lord Milton, later the 1st Earl of Dorchester. The couple received an income of ¬£5,000 from Lord Milton, and were left large fortunes by Milton and Henry Conway. Damer was described as a poor businessman, who had a taste for expensive clothing. The marriage was not a successful one. The couple had no children and separated after seven years. In 1775, Anne was included in a painting titled The Three Witches form Macbeth by Daniel Gardner (c.1750‚Äì1805), which can be found in The National Portrait Gallery, London. The work shows her next to other ladies of high society: Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne and Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Anne's husband committed suicide in 1776, leaving considerable debts. As a widow, Anne benefitted from a prenuptial agreement whereby her father-in-law was obliged to pay her ¬£2500 a year. This money allowed her to be financially independent, and continue her artistic career. Whilst immersing herself in sculpture, she still found time for a full social life, on a more intellectual plane than that of her earlier married years. Anne was a frequent visitor to Europe. In 1779, she had watched from the deck, a four-hour running gunfight between a French privateer and the cross Channel packet boat on which she was travelling. During one voyage she was captured by a privateer, but released unharmed in Jersey. In 1790‚Äì91, she travelled alone through Portugal and Spain and back through revolutionary France. She visited Sir Horace Mann in Florence, and Sir William Hamilton in Naples, where she was introduced to Lord Nelson. In 1801, she published a novel, Belmour, a book she had written in Lisbon. It ran in three editions and was translated into French. In 1802, while the Treaty of Amiens was in effect, she visited Paris with the author Mary Berry and was granted an audience with Napoleon. A fluent French speaker, Anne became friends with Josephine Buonaparte. They corresponded about gardening and plants, mostly in connection to Josephine's garden at Malmaison. Anne had also discussed this with Sir Joseph Banks, one of the founders of the Royal Horticultural Society. A sculptural bust she made of Banks can be found in The British Museum. In 1815, she travelled to Elba, the island where Napoleon had been exiled. She travelled there despite the ongoing war between France and Britain. The Emperor gifted her a snuffbox featuring his portrait, which is housed in the British Museum. When Horace Walpole died in 1797, he left a life interest in Strawberry Hill to Anne. She had the job of recording the contents of Strawberry Hill for the Berry family, who had moved into an adjoining property. Anne used Strawberry Hill as her country house until 1811, which she maintained alongside her central London home in Upper Brook Street. In 1818, she returned to Twickenham, buying York House. From 1818, Anne Damer lived at York House, Twickenham. She continued to sculpt until the end of her life. She died, aged 79, in 1828 at her London house, No. 27 Upper Brook Street, Grosvenor Square. She was buried in the church at Sundridge, Kent. According to Richard Webb, she directed in her will that her correspondence by destroyed and that she be buried with the bones of her dog and her sculpting tools. Works The development of Anne Seymour Damer's interest in sculpture is credited to David Hume (who served as Under-Secretary when her father was Secretary of State, 1766‚Äì1768) and to the encouragement of Horace Walpole, who was her guardian during her parents' frequent trips abroad. According to Walpole, her training included lessons in modelling from Giuseppe Ceracchi, in marble carving from John Bacon, and in anatomy from William Cumberland Cruikshank. During the period 1784‚Äì1818, Damer exhibited 32 works as an honorary exhibitor at the Royal Academy. Her work, primarily busts in Neoclassical style, developed from early wax sculptures to technically complex ones in works in terracotta, bronze, and marble. Her subjects, largely drawn from friends and colleagues in Whig circles, included Lady Melbourne, Nelson, Joseph Banks, George III, Mary Berry, Charles James Fox and herself. She executed several actors' portraits, such as the busts of her friends Sarah Siddons and Elizabeth Farren (as the Muses Melpomene and Thalia). She produced keystone sculptures of Isis and Tamesis for each side of the central arch on the bridge at Henley-on-Thames. The original models are in the Henley Gallery of the River and Rowing Museum nearby. Another major architectural work was her 10-foot statue of Apollo, now destroyed, for the frontage of Drury Lane theatre. She also created two bas reliefs for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of scenes from Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra. Damer was also a writer, with one published novel, Belmour (first published on 1801).

Her guardian and friend Horace Walpole was a significant figure, who helped foster her career and on his death left her his London villa, Strawberry Hill. She also moved in literary and theatrical circles, where her friends included the poet and dramatist Joanna Baillie, the author Mary Berry, and the actors Sarah Siddons and Elizabeth Farren. She frequently took part in masques at the Pantheon and amateur theatricals at the London residence of the Duke of Richmond, who was married to her half- sister.The Letters of Horace Walpole: Earl of Orford, Horace Walpole, H.G. Bohn, 1861. Internet Archive A number of sources have named Damer as being involved in lesbian relationships, particularly relating to her close friendship with Mary Berry, to whom she had been introduced by Walpole in 1789, and with whom she lived together in her later years. Even during her marriage, her likings for male clothing and demonstrative friendships with other women were publicly noted and satirised by hostile commentators such as Hester Thrale and in the anonymous pamphlet A Sapphick Epistle from Jack Cavendish to the Honourable and most Beautiful, Mrs D‚Äî (c.1770).Rictor Norton (Ed.), \\"A Sapphick Epistle, 1778\\", Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook. 1 December 1999, updated 23 February 2003 <> Retrieved on 16 August 2007 A romance between Damer and Elizabeth Farren, who was mentioned by Thrale, is the central storyline in the 2004 novel Life Mask by Emma Donoghue.

He played for the Illawarra Steelers and St. George Dragons in the ARL, and Workington Town in the Super League. He coached the Huddersfield Giants, Leeds Rhinos and the Warrington Wolves in the Super League, and Japan, Great Britain and England at international level. Background Smith was born in Lismore, New South Wales, Australia. He is the younger brother of fellow rugby league coach Brian Smith and uncle to former Tonga national team coach, Rohan Smith. He holds a British passport. Playing career Tony Smith played rugby league with the Illawarra Steelers, for whom he made 40 appearances and scored 9 tries, as well as the St. George Dragons for whom he played 48 games under the coaching of his older brother Brian Smith, including the 1992 NSWRL season's grand final, in which he played from the interchange bench. =Workington Town= Tony Smith's involvement with British Rugby League began by finishing his playing career in 1996 with a spell at Workington Town in the inaugural Super League season. His initial time at Workington was hampered by Achilles tendon injury suffered two seasons previous, made all the worse by Workington's poor form which saw them relegated to National League One. He also notoriously lived above a Workington fish 'n' chip shop with his wife, commenting \\"every morning I trudged to training and swore we'd never come back to this country.\\" His most notable on- field contribution was on his d√©but as he helped the club to an 18-18 draw with Halifax Blue Sox, one of only five points that the club secured in 1996 as they finished bottom of Super League. Smith's high bomb led to the side's third try, scored by Wayne Kitchin. Coaching career In 2000 he was appointed the head coach of the Japan national rugby league team for the Emerging Nations tournament. Unfortunately his spell wasn't successful as Japan failed and lost all three games in the Tournament. =Huddersfield Giants= After returning home to Australia after finishing his playing career with Workington, Smith turned to coaching and applied for the job of Super League club Huddersfield Giants in September 2001. His first season in charge saw Huddersfield Giants relegated to National League One, which consequently followed their dreadful start to the season losing 13 games in a row, a record number of consecutive defeats for a coach who held on to his job in British Rugby League. Conversely, Huddersfield Giants returned to Super League the following year after not losing a single game throughout the National League One season. This culminated in their Grand Final win against Leigh Centurions which secured the team's promotion. In their return season to Super League in 2003 Huddersfield Giants avoided relegation, finishing in 10th place which at the time was by far the club's best Super League finish. =Leeds Rhinos= Smith was appointed head coach of the Leeds Rhinos in a surprise move in November 2003 as the club decided to move incumbent Daryl Powell into an upstairs role for two years from the start of the 2004 season. He guided the Leeds Rhinos to their 2004 Super League Grand Final victory against the Bradford Bulls, their first Championship in 32 years, and went on to beat the Canterbury Bulldogs in the 2005 World Club Challenge at Elland Road. In 2005 Leeds made both the Challenge Cup Final and 2005 Super League Grand Final, but were unsuccessful in both matches, losing to Hull F.C. and the Bradford Bulls respectively. Smith was however named Super League coach of the year for 2005 and signed a contract extension to the end of the 2006 season. The Leeds Rhinos failed to win a trophy in the 2006 season, suffering defeat at the Semi-Final stage of the Challenge Cup and losing out to the Warrington Wolves in 2006's Super League XI Play-Offs. Smith secured his second Super League championship with victory in the 2007 Super League Grand Final, his final game as coach of Leeds Rhinos. =Great Britain= Smith was announced as the successor to Brian Noble and became the full-time coach of Great Britain. He saw out his Leeds contract until the end of the 2007 season and combined the GB coaching role with that of performance director and headed up the Rugby Football League's technical department at Leeds Metropolitan University. His first game in charge of Great Britain was a victory over France. The 3-0 whitewash of New Zealand followed with a 20-14 victory at Huddersfield, a 44-0 thrashing of the Kiwis in the 2nd test at Hull and a final test win at the JJB by 28 points to 22. Leeds Rhinos players contributed hugely to these victories including captain Jamie Peacock, half-backs Rob Burrow and Danny McGuire, 2nd Row Gareth Ellis and centre Keith Senior. As this was the last test series as a Great Britain side on home soil. Smith then led the England side into the 2008 World Cup. Only overseas touring sides now use the Great Britain name. At the end of the year, Tony was named the RLIF Coach of the Year for a successful 2007 season. =England= Smith became a naturalized British citizen on 8 September 2008 at a ceremony in Huddersfield. He coached England in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, making the semi-finals. =Warrington Wolves= On 5 March 2009, Warrington Wolves announced that Smith was to take over as their new head coach while continuing to coach England on a part-time basis. His first game in charge of Warrington was a 14-20 defeat at home to former club Leeds Rhinos. On 29 August 2009, he led Warrington to their first Challenge Cup Final since 1990, and ultimately the team's first final victory since 1974, beating his former club the Huddersfield Giants 25-16. Smith coached the Warrington Wolves to their 2010 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium, their second consecutive Cup victory. and there are groups on Facebook about smith Smith coached the Warrington Wolves to their first League Leaders' Shield in the Super League era in 2011 and the Warrington Wolves became the first team in 6-years to break 1,000 points scored during one season (the last team to do so being Smith's Leeds Rhinos, along with St. Helens and the Bradford Bulls in the same season). He led the Wolves to their 2012 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. He coached the Warrington Wolves to the 2012 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford. He played in the 2013 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford. He coached the Warrington Wolves to the 2016 Challenge Cup Final defeat by Hull F.C. at Wembley Stadium. After leading Warrington Wolves to the Super League Grand Final in 2012, 2013 and 2016 at Old Trafford, and also his second League Leaders' Shield in 2016, his spell as Warrington Wolves coach ended in 2017 when he departed the club at the end of the 2017 Super League season; at the time he was the league's longest-serving coach. =Hull Kingston Rovers= Tony Smith was announced as the new head coach of Hull Kingston Rovers on 6 June 2019 following the sacking of former Hull KR coach Tim Sheens the day before.

The guides adopt an unusual format, in that not all species in the geographical area of coverage are included; instead only groups of species which the authors regarded as difficult to identify are covered. Each such group is given a chapter, where identification is covered discursively rather than in the abbreviated form more usually used in a field guide.

Gigabeat The Gigabeat was first called the MobilPhile and later renamed to Gigabeat. It contained a monochrome LCD with blue backlighting, and a 5 GB removable PCMCIA hard drive. Its case was made of aluminum, and battery life is specified at 18 hours. It required music to be converted using the Toshiba Audio Application to an encrypted format. It has a circular dpad surrounding a smaller circular play/pause button, 2 menu buttons, side-mounted volume up/down buttons and a lock switch. Gigabeat G The Gigabeat G was first introduced during the Japanese WPC Expo in September 2003. The hard drive player features capacities from 5 GB to 40 GB, support for MP3, WMA and WAV sound files, USB 2.0, and integration with Windows Media Player. The device has a 160x86-pixel monochromic screen with blue backlighting. Battery life is specified at 11 hours. It is only available in Japan. The Gigabeat G was updated and branded as the G21. This version offered some new features such as LAN addressing. Gigabeat F The Gigabeat F was released in September 2004. The hard drive player is available in capacities from 10 to 60 GB, and has a 2.2\\" 16-bit TFT LCD screen with a QVGA resolution. Battery life lasts up to 16 hours, and reportedly 19 hours if the backlight is set to 5 seconds. The Gigabeat F introduced a new controller called \\"Plustouch\\" which is a touch sensitive control system on a plus-shaped pad. Like the Gigabeat G, the player supports MP3, WMA (as well as protected WMA format), and WAV, but encrypts all uploaded files to a special SAT format. In November 2005, Toshiba released simultaneous upgrades to the Gigabeat F's firmware and the Gigabeat Room software. An English version was released in March 2006. Problems with image transferring and distortion were solved, and an equalizer was added to the player. The Gigabeat F is a popular candidate for alternative firmware with its rich screen, strong processor, ample storage capacities and simple hardware customisation capabilities. It is compatible with all Toshiba 1.8\\" hard drives (up to 80gb with the original firmware, more with third party firmware), can take iPod replacement batteries with little or no modification, and is capable of running the Rockbox digital audio player firmware. Gigabeat X The Gigabeat X was an update to the F series; changes included the dropping of the 40 GB version for a 30 GB version, and a 16-hour battery life. The X-series has a larger 2.4\\" 16-bit TFT LCD display, which enables it to display images. It also has a smaller body (similar to the future Gigabeat S) and raised Plustouch pad. It was sold primarily in Australia and various Asian countries. Gigabeat P The Gigabeat P series players are Toshiba's first attempt at entering the flash-based Digital audio player (DAP) market. The player features a 1.1-inch, 16-bit OLED screen of a resolution of 96 by 96 pixels and comes in two different capacities. The P5 is available in two different colour variations and is the 512 MB model, whereas the P10 is only available in 1 GB in black. Both types support MP3, WMA, and WAV, and includes a built-in FM tuner. =Special editions= The Gigabeat P5S is a Japanese-only, 512 MB model of the Gigabeat P that was released in July 2006 (Trapnest models) and August 2006 (Blast models), which featured custom plates of Nana characters. Gigabeat S The Gigabeat S was released in Japan in April 2006 and in the United States on the last day of May 2006. The player was first presented at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2006 in Las Vegas by Bill Gates in his keynote speech. It uses version 2 of the Portable Media Center interface by Microsoft and the device closely integrates with Windows Media Player 11 and the Xbox 360. The player has a 12-hour battery life for audio and plays video for up to 2.5 hours. The Gigabeat S is the first of subsequent Toshiba players that does not include Gigabeat Room to transfer and sync content, the players are now compatible with Windows Media Player. The player offers a 2.4-inch, 16-bit TFT LCD display with a QVGA resolution and storage capacities of 30 GB or 60 GB. It also has a built-in FM tuner and audio support for MP3, WAV, WMA (both lossy and lossless), while the player natively supports WMV. Other video formats such as MPEG-4, AVI and QuickTime are only supported through transcoding. The device is also PlaysForSure-certified, which means that it is compatible with online stores like Napster To Go. The Gigabeat S also has a USB Host for downloading images directly off digital cameras without the need of a computer, while connecting the player to a TV needs an optional composite TV-out cable. On March 3, 2009, Toshiba released a firmware update which upgrades the Platform to 1.3 (from 1.1).http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi- bin/tais/support/jsp/modelContent.jsp?ct=DL&os;=&category;=&moid;=2288417&rpn;=&modelFilter;=MES30V&selCategory;=6&selFamily;=727858&selModel;=2288417 There are no release notes and the changes are unknown. =Criticism= Some users have encountered a problem when the player deletes all media on its hard drive after being disconnected from USB sync with a computer.: Gigabeat Forums : Gigabeat S Series : *Removing Media Items* + Rant: Gigabeat Forums : Gigabeat S Series : Gigabeat deleting itself!?!??!?!?! Although Microsoft's Zune is based on the hardware of this player, it is not affected due to a different firmware. This problem has been left unresolved; it is not known whether the March 2009 update resolves this issue. Gigabeat V The Gigabeat V, released in October 2006 in a capacity of 30 GB, is Toshiba's first attempt at a portable media player. Although the device is larger, with a 3.5-inch TFT LCD screen, the Gigabeat V shares the same interface, media formats, and internal hardware design as the Gigabeat S. It is bundled with a USB cable, an A/V output jack, and a custom splitter cable. The player has a 30-hour battery life for audio and 8 hours for video. Unlike many other portable media players, the Gigabeat V lacks the ability to charge through USB. The Japanese version includes recording audio and 1seg TV programming. = Second- generation = Gigabeat V41 A new version of the Gigabeat V was released on June 1, 2007 in Japan. It supports a 4-inch widescreen with a resolution of 480 x 272 pixels, and is available in capacities of 40 GB and 80 GB. The player's battery life is rated at about 28 hours for audio, and 10 hours for video. It also has a 1seg TV tuner.

The first Rebbe of Slonim, Rabbi Avraham Weinberg (1804‚Äì1883), was the author of Yesod HaAvodah. In 1873, he sent a group of his grandchildren and other Hasidim to settle in Ottoman Palestine; they set up their community in Tiberias. Almost all of the Slonimer Hasidim in Europe perished at the hands of the Nazis in the Holocaust. The present-day Slonimer community was rebuilt from the Slonimer Hasidim who had settled in Israel.

Playing career He started his career in Leeds United's youth team. Tinkler was part of the youth team that made the FA Youth Cup Final and played against a Manchester United side that fielded a mass of future internationals including David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. Leeds United won 4‚Äì1 on aggregate. In 1993 Tinkler was promoted to the first team aged 18 and made his debut in the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Sheffield United. However, Tinkler found his opportunities scarce at Leeds and he was mostly used as midfield cover. In his first four seasons at Leeds, Tinkler started just 19 first team matches and made 5 substitute appearances. During the 1996/97 season, In order to gain more first team appearances Tinkler was loaned to York City. Tinkler made nine appearances for the Minstermen.

Mark Tinkler went on to play a key role for York in the 1997/98 season and played in all but 2 of their 46 league matches, scoring 4 goals in the process. Tinkler made a similar impact for the following season and added another 36 league appearances to his tally. When York's ex-manager Alan Little became the new manager of Southend, Mark Tinkler decided to follow him and he was signed in time for the 1999/00 season. Mark Tinkler's first season at Southend was a successful one and he managed to make 41 league appearances. Mark Tinkler started his second season at Southend strongly but it was unfortunately cut short after he fell off his ladder. The following season saw Tinkler sign for Hartlepool despite protests from the Southend fans. Tinkler's Hartlepool debut came against Scunthorpe and he immediately cemented his place in the first team and he formed a formidable partnership alongside Paul Stephenson and Tommy Miller. He managed to play a pivotal role in helping Hartlepool make the play-offs making 30 appearances, scoring 3 goals. The following season saw Tinkler score more goals than he had previously in his whole career as he managed to notch up nine goals and once again help Hartlepool make the play-offs. Tinkler followed this season through and was part of Hartlepool's promotion winning team and he once again broke his goals season totally, this time notching 13 goals in 45 starts. One of Tinkler's most notable performances came in the 4‚Äì3 win against Wrexham where he managed to score his first hattrick. During the following seasons, Tinkler would once again play a vital part in Hartlepool's team as he helped establish them in League 1.

The river roughly flows from south-west to north-east, from Barisan Mountains range that formed the backbone of Sumatra, in Kepahiang, Bengkulu, to the Bangka Strait that formed the extension of South China Sea. It is about 750 kilometers long, and drains most of South Sumatra province. After flowing through Palembang, the provincial capital, it joins with the several other rivers, including the Banyuasin River, to form a delta near the city of Sungsang. The river, dredged to a depth of about 6.5 meters, is navigable by large ships as far as Palembang, which is the site of major port facilities used primarily for the export of petroleum, rubber and palm-oil. This river system, especially around the city of Palembang, was the heart of eponymous 7th to 13th century Srivijayan empire. The river mouth was the site of the SilkAir Flight 185 plane crash which killed all 104 passengers and crew on board in December 1997.

It states that for a closed system, with constant external parameters and entropy, the internal energy will decrease and approach a minimum value at equilibrium. External parameters generally means the volume, but may include other parameters which are specified externally, such as a constant magnetic field. In contrast, for isolated systems (and fixed external parameters), the second law states that the entropy will increase to a maximum value at equilibrium. An isolated system has a fixed total energy and mass. A closed system, on the other hand, is a system which is connected to another, and cannot exchange matter (i.e. particles), but other forms of energy (e.g. heat), with the other system. If, rather than an isolated system, we have a closed system, in which the entropy rather than the energy remains constant, then it follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics that the energy of that system will drop to a minimum value at equilibrium, transferring its energy to the other system. To restate: * The maximum entropy principle: For a closed system with fixed internal energy (i.e. an isolated system), the entropy is maximized at equilibrium. * The minimum energy principle: For a closed system with fixed entropy, the total energy is minimized at equilibrium. Mathematical explanation The total energy of the system is U(S,X_1,X_2,\\\\dots) where S is entropy, and the X_i are the other extensive parameters of the system (e.g. volume, particle number, etc.). The entropy of the system may likewise be written as a function of the other extensive parameters as S(U,X_1,X_2,...). Suppose that X is one of the X_i which varies as a system approaches equilibrium, and that it is the only such parameter which is varying. The principle of maximum entropy may then be stated as: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial X}\\\\right)_U=0 and \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2S}{\\\\partial X^2}\\\\right)_U < 0 at equilibrium. The first condition states that entropy is at an extremum, and the second condition states that entropy is at a maximum. Note that for the partial derivatives, all extensive parameters are assumed constant except for the variables contained in the partial derivative, but only U, S, or X are shown. It follows from the properties of an exact differential (see equation 8 in the exact differential article) and from the energy/entropy equation of state that, for a closed system: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial X}\\\\right)_S = -\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial X}\\\\right)_U}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial U}\\\\right)_X} =-T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial X}\\\\right)_U = 0 It is seen that the energy is at an extremum at equilibrium. By similar but somewhat more lengthy argument it can be shown that :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2U}{\\\\partial X^2}\\\\right)_S=-T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2S}{\\\\partial X^2}\\\\right)_U which is greater than zero, showing that the energy is, in fact, at a minimum. Examples Consider, for one, the familiar example of a marble on the edge of a bowl. If we consider the marble and bowl to be an isolated system, then when the marble drops, the potential energy will be converted to the kinetic energy of motion of the marble. Frictional forces will convert this kinetic energy to heat, and at equilibrium, the marble will be at rest at the bottom of the bowl, and the marble and the bowl will be at a slightly higher temperature. The total energy of the marble-bowl system will be unchanged. What was previously the potential energy of the marble, will now reside in the increased heat energy of the marble-bowl system. This will be an application of the maximum entropy principle as set forth in the principle of minimum potential energy, since due to the heating effects, the entropy has increased to the maximum value possible given the fixed energy of the system. If, on the other hand, the marble is lowered very slowly to the bottom of the bowl, so slowly that no heating effects occur (i.e. reversibly), then the entropy of the marble and bowl will remain constant, and the potential energy of the marble will be transferred as energy to the surroundings. The surroundings will maximize its entropy given its newly acquired energy, which is equivalent to the energy having been transferred as heat. Since the potential energy of the system is now at a minimum with no increase in the energy due to heat of either the marble or the bowl, the total energy of the system is at a minimum. This is an application of the minimum energy principle. Alternatively, suppose we have a cylinder containing an ideal gas, with cross sectional area A and a variable height x. Suppose that a weight of mass m has been placed on top of the cylinder. It presses down on the top of the cylinder with a force of mg where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Suppose that x is smaller than its equilibrium value. The upward force of the gas is greater than the downward force of the weight, and if allowed to freely move, the gas in the cylinder would push the weight upward rapidly, and there would be frictional forces that would convert the energy to heat. If we specify that an external agent presses down on the weight so as to very slowly (reversibly) allow the weight to move upward to its equilibrium position, then there will be no heat generated and the entropy of the system will remain constant while energy is transferred as work to the external agent. The total energy of the system at any value of x is given by the internal energy of the gas plus the potential energy of the weight: :U=TS-PAx+\\\\mu N+mgx\\\\, where T is temperature, S is entropy, P is pressure, Œº is the chemical potential, N is the number of particles in the gas, and the volume has been written as V=Ax. Since the system is closed, the particle number N is constant and a small change in the energy of the system would be given by: :dU = T\\\\,dS-PA\\\\,dx+mg\\\\,dx Since the entropy is constant, we may say that dS=0 at equilibrium and by the principle of minimum energy, we may say that dU=0 at equilibrium, yielding the equilibrium condition: :0=-PA+mg\\\\, which simply states that the upward gas pressure force (PA) on the upper face of the cylinder is equal to the downward force of the mass due to gravitation (mg).  Thermodynamic potentials  The principle of minimum energy can be generalized to apply to constraints other than fixed entropy. For other constraints, other state functions with dimensions of energy will be minimized. These state functions are known as thermodynamic potentials. Thermodynamic potentials are at first glance just simple algebraic combinations of the energy terms in the expression for the internal energy. For a simple, multicomponent system, the internal energy may be written: :U(S,V,\\\\\\\\{N_j\\\\\\\\})=TS-PV+\\\\sum_j\\\\mu_jN_j\\\\, where the intensive parameters (T, P, Œºj) are functions of the internal energy's natural variables (S,V,\\\\\\\\{N_j\\\\\\\\}) via the equations of state. As an example of another thermodynamic potential, the Helmholtz free energy is written: :A(T,V,\\\\\\\\{N_j\\\\\\\\})=U-TS\\\\, where temperature has replaced entropy as a natural variable. In order to understand the value of the thermodynamic potentials, it is necessary to view them in a different light. They may in fact be seen as (negative) Legendre transforms of the internal energy, in which certain of the extensive parameters are replaced by the derivative of internal energy with respect to that variable (i.e. the conjugate to that variable). For example, the Helmholtz free energy may be written: :A(T,V,\\\\\\\\{N_j\\\\\\\\})=\\\\mathrm{min}_S(U(S,V,\\\\\\\\{N_j\\\\\\\\})-TS)\\\\, and the minimum will occur when the variable T becomes equal to the temperature since :T=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial S}\\\\right)_{V,\\\\\\\\{N_j\\\\\\\\}} The Helmholtz free energy is a useful quantity when studying thermodynamic transformations in which the temperature is held constant. Although the reduction in the number of variables is a useful simplification, the main advantage comes from the fact that the Helmholtz free energy is minimized at equilibrium with respect to any unconstrained internal variables for a closed system at constant temperature and volume. This follows directly from the principle of minimum energy which states that at constant entropy, the internal energy is minimized. This can be stated as: :U_o(S_o)=\\\\mathrm{min}_x(U(S_o,x))\\\\, where U_o and S_o are the value of the internal energy and the (fixed) entropy at equilibrium. The volume and particle number variables have been replaced by x which stands for any internal unconstrained variables. As a concrete example of unconstrained internal variables, we might have a chemical reaction in which there are two types of particle, an A atom and an A2 molecule. If N_1 and N_2 are the respective particle numbers for these particles, then the internal constraint is that the total number of A atoms N_A is conserved: :N_A=N_1+2N_2\\\\, we may then replace the N_1 and N_2 variables with a single variable x=N_1/N_2 and minimize with respect to this unconstrained variable. There may be any number of unconstrained variables depending on the number of atoms in the mixture. For systems with multiple sub-volumes, there may be additional volume constraints as well. The minimization is with respect to the unconstrained variables. In the case of chemical reactions this is usually the number of particles or mole fractions, subject to the conservation of elements. At equilibrium, these will take on their equilibrium values, and the internal energy U_o will be a function only of the chosen value of entropy S_o. By the definition of the Legendre transform, the Helmholtz free energy will be: :A(T,x)=\\\\mathrm{min}_{S}(U(S,x)-TS)\\\\, The Helmholtz free energy at equilibrium will be: :A_o(T_o)=\\\\mathrm{min}_{S_o}(U_o(S_o)-T_oS_o) where T_o is the (unknown) temperature at equilibrium. Substituting the expression for U_o: :A_o=\\\\mathrm{min}_{S_o}(\\\\mathrm{min}_x(U(S_o,x))-T_oS_o) By exchanging the order of the extrema: :A_o=\\\\mathrm{min}_x(\\\\mathrm{min}_{S_o}(U(S_o,x)-T_oS_o)) = \\\\mathrm{min}_x(A_o(T_o,x)) showing that the Helmholtz free energy is minimized at equilibrium. The Enthalpy and Gibbs free energy, are similarly derived.

Biography He was born in Sydney, Australia, and educated at Canterbury Boys High School and later at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. In the early 1950s, he moved to London, by way of New Zealand and the Pitcairn Islands, during which time he worked briefly for Ngaio Marsh's theatre company. From initially earning a living by playing the piano in bars and clubs (he was briefly No√´l Coward's rehearsal pianist), he developed an interest in design, establishing the fledgling Marble & Lemon decorative arts business in Cheval Place, Knightsbridge. This led to a partnership with the long-established New Bond Street dealer‚ÄîPartridge Fine Arts‚Äîwhich began in 1957 and lasted well into the next decade. Bannenberg created the setting for the 3rd International Art Treasures exhibitions at the Victoria & Albert Museum in 1962‚Äîthe design of which was described by The Times on 2 March 1962 as \\"well adapted to facilitate appreciation by the planning of its series of compartments\\". His profile continued to rise and, in 1965, he was selected by Cunard as one of the interior designers for their new liner‚Äîknown initially as Q4, but later to be the Queen Elizabeth 2‚Äîunder construction at the John Brown Shipyard in Glasgow. Bannenberg was allocated to design the Double Room, the Card Room, and some of the First Class suites. His first yacht commission was the sailing yacht Tiawana, built by the Camper & Nicholsons in Southampton and delivered in 1968. Shortly thereafter, he was commissioned to design a large motor yacht, Carinthia V, by German retail magnate Helmut Horten. She was shortly followed by the almost identical Carinthia VI, described as an icon of 20th century yacht design. In a career, which was to extend a further thirty years, Bannenberg designed almost two hundred yacht projects, as well as working on residential projects, aircraft interiors, car interiors, furniture design and hotels. His clients included Larry Ellison, Malcolm Forbes, Alan Bond, Bennett S. LeBow, Adnan Khashoggi, and Robert Maxwell. Limitless (Mallorca, 2006) Bannenberg would design both the exterior and interior of all his yacht projects. Once referred to as a 'stylist' by Yachting Magazine, he was quick to write to the editor in trenchant terms: \\"Either one is a designer or not. The word 'stylist' to me conjures up some kind of flimsy tweaking of a structure, whereas quite the opposite is true, at least in our own case. Could you do me a great personal favour, either when compiling a new directory or when mentioning my name (should you ever do so after receiving this letter) and refer to me as what I am: a designer‚Äîperhaps a nitpicking, irritating one, but nevertheless not a stylist. That is a title I gratefully concede to Vidal Sassoon.\\" He likened himself to the conductor of an orchestra: someone who could not play all the instruments, but knew exactly the sound they should all be producing. Bannenberg worked with shipyards in the Netherlands, Italy, France, Germany and England. He rekindled the connection with the country of his birth with a collaboration with the Oceanfast yard in Perth, Australia. On two separate occasions he produced designs for a successor to HMY Britannia. Recognition He was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) in 1978, the first yacht designer to be so honoured since Charles E. Nicholson in 1934. Death Bannenberg died of an inoperable Brain tumour at his home in London on 26 May 2002. Legacy Bannenberg & Rowell Design continues to design yachts, under the direction of Jon's son Dickie Bannenberg and Creative Director Simon Rowell. Jon's son Cam Bannenberg is a sustainable investor, primarily in the food and travel sectors, through investment company Bannenberg Invests.

On 23 February 2007, she took part in a blockade of Faslane Naval Base and was subsequently impounded by the MoD police but after weeks of the ship being impounded and campaigning the vessel was released. =2013 incident= In September 2013, Arctic Sunrise participated in Greenpeace protests against oil drilling activities by the Russian energy company Gazprom at the Prirazlomnaya oil rig in the Pechora Sea. Greenpeace opposes oil drilling in the Arctic on the grounds that oil drilling damages the Arctic ecosystem, and that no safety plans are in place to prevent oil spills. Earlier in August 2012, Greenpeace staged similar protests against the same oil rig. On 18 September, the crew of Arctic Sunrise circled the Prirazlomnaya oil rig, while three crew attempted to board the platform. In response, the Russian Coast Guard seized control of the ship and detained the activists. The ship was later towed by a coast guard vessel to the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. The Arctic Sunrise crew consisted of 30 members from 16 nationalities. The Russian government intended to charge the Greenpeace activists with piracy, which carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years of imprisonment, although Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the activists are obviously \\"not pirates\\".Amnesty: Piracy charges 'absurd' . 3 News NZ. 4 October 2013. Putin distanced himself from the case and indicated that the independent Russian judiciary would continue with the investigation. On 23 October 2013 the Russian prosecution altered the charges against the activists, rescinding the piracy allegation and charging them instead with hooliganism. A conviction of hooliganism in Russia can result in costly fines and up to seven years in prison. According to Phil Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace in the U.S. at the time, the reaction of the Russian coast guard and courts was the \\"stiffest response that Greenpeace has encountered from a government since the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985.\\" The Netherlands asked the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea to order Russia to release a Greenpeace ship and the activists who were on board.Netherlands asks sea law tribunal to order Russia to release Greenpeace ship and activists, Washington Post, 21 October 2013 Russia subsequently indicated that it would not participate in the tribunal since the matter was an issue of internal Russian law involving criminal acts against Russian property. Despite the non- appearance, the Tribunal granted provisional measures releasing the entire crew and the ship on a financial bond. The ship was boarded by the Russian coast guard and towed 500 miles from the Pechora Sea to the northern Russian port of Murmansk in September 2013. The 30 activists were all released from prison due to an amnesty in celebration of the 20th anniversary of Russia's post-Soviet constitution, but the ship remained in Russian port pending a decision by the Russian investigative committee (IC) until June 2014.Arctic 30: Russia releases Greenpeace ship, Russian authorities have released the Arctic Sunrise, which was involved in a high-profile protest against Arctic oil drilling The Guardian 6 June 2014 Russia was ordered to pay damages on 24 August 2015 to the Netherlands over its seizure. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said the amount of damages would be decided at a later date. On 18 July 2017 the International Arbitration Tribunal in The Hague ordered the Russian Federation to pay the Netherlands 5,4 million euros.

Biography Shirihai is the son of Batia and Eli Shirihai. His mother was a schoolteacher, his father was a zoologist in Israel. He grew up in Jerusalem where he became fascinated with birds when he was 13 and spent much time documenting shorebird behaviour, raptor breeding biology and participating in bird migration surveys. In the 1980s and 1990s, he lived in Eilat on Israel's Red Sea coast, where he founded the International Birdwatching Center, becoming its first director. Scientific career Shirihai was behind the discovery of several new species in the Western Palearctic and Israel. He worked as an escort for birding trips into the southern Negev desert, showing many observers locally breeding Hume's tawny owl and Nubian nightjar among other little-watched species of the area. He has written a number of bird identification papers, mostly published in English in magazines such as British Birds and Birding World. With David Christie, he co-wrote the Macmillan Birder's Guide to European and Middle Eastern birds among several other works. Shirihai is a consummate birder, having added 50 previously undocumented new bird species to the List of birds of Israel, and 10 new species to the Western Palearctic list of birds. In January 2015, a newly described owl species, Strix hadorami, was named after Shirihai by Dr. Manuel Schweizer and colleagues. Published works He is the author of The Birds of Israel and co-author of a definitive work on the genus Sylvia. He serves as an editorial consultant to leading bird magazines in Europe such as Dutch Birding and Birdwatch. Hadoram's main sphere of interest was the complex geographical variation shown by birds breeding in and migrating through the Middle East. He extended his research to Europe, northeast Africa and Asia, publishing The Photographic Handbook for Western Palearctic Birds (Shirihai & Svensson) and The Handbook for Geographical Variation of Palearctic Birds (Roselaar & Shirihai). In the mid-1990s, Shirihai turned his attention to oceanic birds and marine mammals, particularly those of the Southern Hemisphere. He published The Complete Guide to Antarctic Wildlife, and commenced a 10-year project to produce the Photographic Handbook of Birds of the World. Shirihai has visited almost every subantarctic island and the breeding grounds of all forms of albatrosses, with special interest in plumage variation and identification. In 2008, he confirmed the continuing existence of the mysterious Beck's petrel (Pseudobulweria becki), known until then from 2 specimens collected in the 1920s and a handful of tentative sight records.

An Australia international representative, he played his club football in the NRL for the Penrith Panthers (with whom he won the 2003 premiership) and the Brisbane Broncos. He also played for English club Hull Kingston Rovers in the Super League. Background Joel Clinton was born in Riverstone, New South Wales on 8 December 1981. He played for the Parramatta Eels, before joining the Penrith club. Professional playing career Clinton playing for the Panthers in 2006 Clinton rose to prominence in the Panthers Panthers' successful 2003 season, he helped the Panthers come from last place in 2003 to become Minor Premiers and eventual victory in the 2003 NRL Grand final. At the end of the 2003 NRL season, he went on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series. He described the experience as \\"a great personal bonus but it did not compare to winning the premiership with the guys you train and play with all year long.\\" As 2003 NRL premiers, the Panthers travelled to England to face Super League VIII champions, the Bradford Bulls in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Clinton played at prop forward in the Panthers' 22‚Äì4 loss. Clinton's good form continued into 2004 and he was selected in the Australian team that took on the Kiwis in the 2004 ANZAC Test. =2006 season= The Panther's first loss of the 2006 season came against the Canberra Raiders, a close, golden-point match. During the game, Clinton was hit by a high tackle from Canberra Raiders Simon Woolford. Clinton received a black eye, but got up off the ground smiling, and continued playing. Clinton's ability to brush off the hit left Woolford claiming the high tackle wasn't that serious. These comments left Clinton steaming, saying \\"Woolford should learn to keep his mouth shut.\\"http://www.newstext.com.au/docs/DTM/2006/get.jsp?docid=DTM-20060405-1-084-4215249V8@NSW- METRO-2006-2005 In May 2006, Clinton was selected to trial for the New South Wales State of Origin team in the Country v. City game. Clinton played for City and commented before the game that he intended to \\"smash his way into the NSW side.\\" Clinton saved a try in the first 20 minutes, diving on a cross-kick into the in-goal by Country. City eventually lost by 2 points, conceding tries while Clinton was off the field. Joel Clinton hits the Warriors' line in Round 21 of the 2006 season Manly five-eighth Travis Burns branded Joel Clinton as \\"childish\\" and a \\"bad sport\\" for allegedly squirting him with a water bottle while lining up a match-winning penalty goal in Round 20 (23 July 2006). Viewing the replay, it appears that Clinton was standing over 10 metres away from Burns, leading Coach John Lang to comment \\"it must've been a bloody big squirt\\". 'That Tackle' In Round 19, 15 July 2006, Clinton made international headlines with a tackle on Ty Williams of the North Queensland Cowboys. With the Penrith Panthers ahead 12‚Äì8; Cowboys winger Ty Williams broke the Panthers line and headed for a runaway try in the corner. However, Clinton had enough pace and tenacity to pull the Queensland Origin player into touch just centimeters out from the tryline.Panthers heap on more misery for Cowboys Considered one of the fastest men in the NRL over one hundred metres, Williams was running for a game-changing four points. Instead, Clinton single- handedly reversed the momentum of the match. This allowed Panthers winger Michael Gordon to score in the final minute, giving the Panthers an unlikely 17‚Äì8 win. =2007 season= Pre-season Fresh from the off-season under new coach Matthew Elliott, Clinton said that confidence within the Panthers team was high for 2007. \\"Blokes like me, Trent Waterhouse and Luke Lewis have taken on a leadership role this year,\\" Clinton said. \\"We used to be the younger generation but we've become senior players ourselves.\\" Clinton's level of fitness was also at an all-time high, the off-season training trimming Clinton down from 115 kg to 108 kg. \\"I've never been this fit,\\" Joel said. \\"I'm feeling unreal. Elliot commented that \\"(Joel's) training has been nothing short of phenomenal and I'm expecting his performances to follow.\\" Regular season Clinton put the initial Panthers loss to the Cronulla Sharks in Round 1 down to the change of coach. \\"Me and most of the other guys have only known one way for the past five years,\\" Clinton said. \\"We've got to start to have belief. You've just got to back yourself, me and the boys. If we do that, we'll shake up the comp. I know it's early days to say that, but I think we should go pretty well.\\" After the Panthers win over the Bulldogs in Round 2, sports journalists were commenting on how important Clinton was to the effort. \\"He'd primed himself to match the muscle of Canterbury's Mark O'Meley and Willie Mason and produced as good a performance as he's given since 2003, when he made the Australian squad as a young prop.\\" In Round 4, in response to Scott Prince complaining about off-the-ball play, Joel Clinton was interviewed for his personal view on dirty tricks in the NRL: \\"If stuff happens on the field you leave it on the field. I never take anything off the field. I don't like to go home and whinge about it.\\" In Round 5, Clinton was criticized for the number of penalties he conceded in the game, and season generally. However, Clinton continued to top the work rates in the Panthers side. In Round 7, the Panthers lost to the Canberra Raiders. Clinton said he was disgusted with the team's performance. During the week, a virus spread through the team, affecting Clinton, Luke Priddis, Frank Puletua, Nathan Smith and Craig Gower ‚Äì who was hospitalised. Despite the virus, Clinton thought it wasn't an excuse for the loss. \\"There were a couple of crook boys but that's something you just have to deal with,\\" Clinton said. 'That Try' In Round 9 the Panthers broke their five match losing streak against the Cowboys, despite the early loss of halfback play-maker Craig Gower. Clinton also broke his season long try scoring drought. Solely chasing a mediocre kick, the bounce of the ball confused Cowboys winger Brenton Bowen, allowing Clinton to gather and score in the corner. The try pushed momentum in favour of the second-from-the-bottom Panthers and pushed second-placed Cowboys \\"into despair.\\"NZ Herald - Breaking news, latest news, business, sport and entertainment Clinton's performance in the game earned him the status of a stand out player of Round 9. \\"Clinton's effort was one of the few spectacular things to happen in a scrappy game, his athletic pick-up on the fly from a Peter Wallace kick belying the fact he is a front row forward and one of the biggest players in the NRL.\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/4058073a1823.html Clinton playing for the Broncos in 2009 =2008 Move to the Broncos= Clinton came off contract in 2008 ‚Äì Panthers rhetoric had suggested he would not be renewed at his current salary.Daily Telegraph  We're for Sydney Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett then met with Clinton in Sydney in May 2007, spiking speculation whether Clinton would join the Broncos for 2008.

He was sacked by Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in June 2005. Playing career McNally started his playing career at Northern Suburbs before a move to Western Suburbs in 1975 where he made his first 'A' Grade appearance and captained the Premiership-winning Reserve Grade team under coach Don Oxenham in 1976. After 3 seasons at the Panthers, McNally moved to Gatton Hawks for a season where Gatton became the Ipswich Premiers, McNally scoring all points in the Grand Final, before accepting an offer to return to Brisbane with Eastern Suburbs Tigers. McNally played 107 'A' Grade games for Easts before retiring in 1984. He was a prop- forward who was also a prolific goal kicker, winning the leading pointscorer trophy three times in the Brisbane 'A' grade competition. He was also a member of Easts' 1983 Premiership team, kicking 3 goals in a 14‚Äì6 defeat of Redlciffe Dolphins at Lang Park. McNally represented Queensland, captained by Wally Lewis on their 1983 tour of England, where he was top pointscorer. Coaching career Shortly following his retirement, McNally began his coaching career, taking charge of Easts 'A' grade in 1987 before coaching junior teams at East Mt Gravatt. He coached Easts 'Colts' (under 19) team to a 3rd-place finish in 1991 before winning a premiership in 1992, a team that featured future State of Origin players Geoff Bell and Paul Green. In 1993 he accepted a job as Development Officer for South-East Division of the Queensland Rugby League. In 1998 he moved to Darwin to take up Head Coach of the Rugby League program at the Northern Territory Institute of Sport. It was in Brisbane in the seventies that he first met the-then Wakefield Trinity Wildcats Head Coach, Peter Roe. McNally was appointed assistant coach to Peter Roe at Wakefield Trinity in November 2001, and was placed in temporary charge in July 2002 after Roe was sacked. His first match in charge was a 22‚Äì22 draw against Widnes Vikings at Belle Vue Stadium. The following week, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats travelled to London, winning 31‚Äì24 over the London Broncos after trailing 0‚Äì18 at half time. Following this match, McNally was appointed Football Manager / Coach, in partnership with Adrian Vowles, who was signed as Player / Coach. Under this leadership, Wakefield stayed up on the last day of the season after defeating Warrington 50‚Äì10. In season 2003, the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats struggled to 11th in the Super League table and Vowles was released by the club. McNally was appointed Head Coach on a 1-year contract. Season 2004 was a watershed year for Wakefield, who finished the Super League regular season in 6th place with 30 points. In the first elimination semi-final they defeated Hull F.C. 28‚Äì18 at the KC Stadium, setting up a semi final clash with Wigan Warriors at the JJB Stadium. Although they led 14‚Äì0 early in the match, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats were defeated 14‚Äì18 with a controversial 'no-try' ruling costing them dearly. McNally was subsequently awarded the 'Coach of the Year' awardhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/super_league/wakefield/4118904.stm and signed a new two-year deal with Wakefield to the end of 2006. Season 2005 started just as brightly for the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, winning away at Bradford Bulls and home to WiganWarriors, to lead the Super League table for the first time in their history after 2 rounds. The sale of captain Gareth Ellis, coupled with injuries to key players Sid Domic and David Solomona disrupted Wakefield however and after a series of losses, McNally was sacked in June. His last game in charge was a 28‚Äì40 loss to the Huddersfield Giants. McNally returned to his native Australia in August 2005, where he took a position of Development Manager with the Wynnum Manly Seagulls in the Queensland Cup. After the resignation of Wynnum head coach Neil Wharton in August 2006, McNally was appointed head coach of the Seagulls for the 2007 season. McNally now has four children, two sons and two daughters.

It runs a programme of lectures, starting its 218th Series in October 2019. The Society formerly owned a building on Bath Street, but since 1994 has been accommodated within the University of Strathclyde. Cyanotype reproduction of seaweed (Ptilota Plumosa) and Title Page of Proceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Vol. XXI, 1889-90 History The Society was founded in 1802 as the Glasgow Philosophical Society by a meeting of sixty people in the former Assembly Rooms, and work began establishing a library collection. The Society was housed in various short-term accommodation until 1831, when a room was made available in the Andersonian University (now the University of Strathclyde). The Society subsequently moved to the Corporation Galleries on Sauchiehall Street in 1868, and in 1880, in conjunction with the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, built new premises on Bath Street. The Society was made a Royal Society in 1901, shortly before its centenary, by Edward VII while Archibald Campbell, 1st Baron Blythswood was President. In 1961, the Society's building was sold and the library, which by that time contained over five thousand volumes, dispersed. The Society began renting lecture halls at the University of Strathclyde. The archives of the Society are now maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow. Activities The Society runs a programme of lectures through the year, including the Kelvin and Graham Lectures, commemorating physicist Lord Kelvin and chemist Thomas Graham respectively, and for which medals are awarded. Lord Kelvin was president of the Society and Thomas Graham Vice-President. The Arts Medal was replaced in 2011 by the Minerva Medal. ‚ÄúArts‚Äù was thought to be restrictive and it was decided that, as Minerva was goddess not only of wisdom but also of music, poetry, medicine, commerce, weaving, crafts and magic, her broad portfolio covers both Arts and Humanities. The image of Minerva appearing on the medal is taken from the image carved on the President‚Äôs chair which is on permanent loan to the University of Strathclyde.

History During the military dictatorship in Brazil, MR8 was formed by Brazilian Communist Party members who disagreed with the party's decision not to take part in armed resistance against the military government, the so- called Dissid√™ncia da Guanabara (DI-GB). The name Movimento Revolucion√°rio 8 de Outubro was taken from another organization, recently destroyed by police repression. Dictatorship propaganda boasted of police effectiveness in suppressing of \\"terrorists,\\" so the DI-GB began using the same name to demoralize the regime. The new organization defined itself as Marxist-Leninist and was the main force behind the kidnapping of American ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick in 1969, which was later the basis for the film Four Days in September. In the late 1970s, MR8 conducted thorough autocriticism for its participation in armed resistance against the dictatorship. Under the leadership of Daniel Terra, it defined the struggle for \\"democratic liberties\\" as the primary task for the Brazilian left and became active inside the MDB, the party of the \\"allowed opposition,\\" under Orestes Qu√©rcia, and had an important role in the reawakening of the student movement in 1976-1977. However, It came to believe that the \\"national issue\\" was more important than the \\"democratic issue\\" and in 1978 shifted its policies. It never abandoned the struggle against the dictatorship, but became increasingly aggressive against other leftist movements, particularly the Trotskyists, frequently seen as antinational and supportive of \\"petty-bourgeois issues\\" like feminism, environmentalism, and gay rights. The MR-8 became increasingly isolated within the left, prompting alliances among other leftist movements against it. While MR8 played an important role in the 1977 student movement, when the working class and unions came again into political play in 1978, the MR-8's role was marginal or frequently even negative. It developed an intense political enmity towards the unionist leadership of the ABC Region, which later gave birth to the Workers' Party (PT). Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and other leaders of the party and its union branch, the Central √önica dos Trabalhadores, were described as social-democrats, yellow unionists and imperialist agents, and accused of dividing the opposition against the dictatorship, the MDB. With the end of the dictatorship, it was the only significant part of the Brazilian left to remain within the PMDB, the continuation of the MDB. Most other groups joined the PT while the Brazilian Communist Party and the Communist Party of Brazil relaunched themselves as independent political parties. The MR8 is a bit of an oddity in Brazilian politics, as it considers itself \\"Marxist- Leninist\\" but is not organized under democratic centralism and operates within a bourgeois centre-to-left political party, in direct contradiction to the Marxist-Leninist tenets of independence from bourgeois organizations. In the late 1990s, MR8 became somewhat reformist like other leftist movements and a more moderate socialist group. It even supporting Lula's successful run for presidency in 2002 and later his government as well. At the same time, it increased its nationalist streak. It publishes a twice-weekly newspaper, Hora do Povo.  Members  Famous members included Fernando Gabeira, Carlos Lamarca, Stuart Angel, and Franklin Martins.  Today  In 2008, it decided that the great changes in Brazil made it time for it to change. On April 21, 2009, it launched the Free Homeland Party (Partido P√°tria Livre), which is now registered.

However, several features have been added which make it incompatible with most games programmed with DIV Games Studio. Features Fenix is an interpreted language focused on 2D video game development. Its main feature, inherited from DIV, is the pseudo- parallel programming similar to Coroutines, i.e. it gives the developer the chance of programming different processes (enemies, characters, etc.) separately, and the engine will synchronize them. This makes video game developing much easier. Most of its features are now based on Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) which makes Fenix a very portable project. Other features include full 2D support (scaling, transparencies, blend ops...), 16 bpp color, sound (.ogg, .mod, .it, .s3m, .wav), joystick support, mode7 and extensions via libraries. Supported platforms * Official: Windows, Linux, Mac OS, BSD, BeOS * Unofficial: GP32, GP2X, GP2X Wiz, Dreamcast, PS2 Status Its current version is 0.92a (beta) and no project maintainer is currently taking care of updating it. The old 0.84 branch ‚Äî which happened to be quite unstable ‚Äî was retaken by SplinterGU, a developer from Argentina who cleaned of all known bugs. Also a GNU default Automake/Autoconf build system, which increases portability, has been implemented, making it very easy to add support for BSD systems in Fenix. Although SplinterGU mainly focused on stabilizing the 0.84 branch, he has also added some new capabilities to Fenix, like a better control of the debug console (also making it display more information). Some of the Fenix 0.8 developers have started a Fenix 2 branch, which should feature a completely rewritten core, on top of which users (game developers) may plug the required libraries, thus increasing flexibility and modularity. However, this second effort seems to be taking a long time, and no ETA or further news about the project has been given by its developers, so it might not be made public soon. SplinterGU, after publicly showing interest in separating the Fenix core from the rest of the interpreter,Fenix Forum SplinterGU's post on modularization (Spanish) and some disagreements with some members of the community, decided to fork Fenix into BennuGD and continued working on this. BennuGD has come a long way and is currently in a much more advanced and stabilized state than the current version of Fenix (0.92a). The program has been separated into a core and multiple modules. The core has been much improved, for example by optimizing the process handling, the modules have been tidied up and many bugfixes have been done. In addition to these improvements, the language itself has been expanded with more functionality, like error handling and goto. The Bennu Forum is quite active and the Bennu Wiki is a good source of documentation. Running Fenix Fenix comes as a console program. There are several IDEs around, being the most popular FBTwo_Project. Many other general-purpose IDEs can be easily adapted to it.

The GPCA was founded in February 1990. The party is ballot-qualified, with 83,281 people registered in the party and espouses Green politics and Ten Key Values of Ecological Wisdom, Nonviolence, Social Justice, Grassroots Democracy, Decentralization, Community-Based Economics, Feminism, Respect for Diversity, Personal & Global Responsibility, and Sustainability. The Key Values of Decentralization, Grassroots Democracy, and Feminism influence the party's structure of being composed of autonomous county parties, GPCA decisions being determined by General Assemblies of delegates from the county parties, and Coordinating Committees' composition being determined by yearly, staggered-term elections of six women and six of any gender. Party membership is possible for California residents whom are denied the right to vote by the state in California or the U.S. federal state, provided they affirm the Ten Key Values, and meet other criteria. The three counties in which the party has the most people registered are Los Angeles (21,719), San Diego (6,518), and Alameda counties (5,683). The counties in which the party has the highest percentages of the county's registrations are Humboldt (1.77%), Mendocino (1.77%), and Trinity counties (1.06%). The party's June 2020 General Assembly took place virtually, by video- and teleconference. Laura Wells is currently the party's only official spokesperson. History =Ballot Access= The party mobilized in 1991 to have registrations of over 83,000 people in the party to meet the threshold of 1% of the vote in the previous general election (78,992 registrations), and thereby secured ballot- access. To maintain qualified status in California, a party must have registered at least 1/15 of 1 percent (0.067%) of the number of the total registered in the state; and either have had a statewide candidate in the party receiving at least 2% of the vote in the most recent gubernatorial primary, or have at least 0.33 percent of the total number of voters registered. The party has met the legal standards to keep continuous ballot access in California since 1992. In 1994, Margaret Garcia received 315,079 votes in the Secretary of State election, 3.8% of the total, surpassing the 2 percent threshold necessary to retain statewide ballot status. The number of people that were required to be registered in a party for it to maintain ballot access rose to 89,007 during the November 1994 election. Green registrations dropped to 78,597 in January, 1995, meaning that had Garcia not received the total she did, the Green Party of California would have lost its ballot status. The party finally met the registrations requirement in September 1996, competing in the November general election with 95,080 registrations, and has met the registration requirements since. The party has also had electoral results that could maintain the party's ballot access, in every election since first qualifying for the ballot. As of February 2020, the party still meets all qualification standards. In California's 2018 primaries, Green candidate Mike Feinstein received 136,726 votes in the Secretary of State election, 2.1% of the total. As of February 18, 2020, there are 83,281 registered party members accounting for 0.40 percent of registered voters in California. =Notable Campaigns= In 1996 Arcata, California, a city with a population of about 17,000, became the first city ever to have a Green majority on the city council, with three of five seats. Greens controlled the council from 1996‚Äì1998 and again from 2004-2006. In the 2000s Gayle McLaughlin won elections as city councilor and mayor in Richmond, California, running with the Green Party designation. During the 2016 presidential election, California Green registrations dropped 30%, from nearly 110,000 to 78,604. Party spokesperson Mike Feinstein stated that \\"the Sanders campaign is absolutely destroying us,\\" alleging that the Sanders campaign targeted Greens with mailers. Thousands of California Greens decided to support Bernie Sanders' bid for the Democratic party presidential nomination, necessitating re-registration either into the Democratic party, or with No Party Preference (NPP), to vote for Sanders. Green mayor Gayle McLaughlin re-registered with NPP to vote for Sanders. The Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) in California saw a similar registration drop-off. The lowest point for the GPCA was around California's primary elections in June, and by the end of the general election, the GPCA's registrations rose back to 94,647 people, and the PFP rose back to original levels, also. The Jill Stein 2016 campaign worked to increase party registrations in California, and throughout the country. Campaign staffer Bruce Dixon wrote that Sanders was a sheepdog candidate, i.e. a candidate that dissuades people from politics outside of certain parties (the Democratic party in this case), in favor of party politics within those parties, despite the parties being opposed to the candidate's cause. This results in lacking of parties and lacking of elections of candidates that would advance the sheepdog's politics; and also results in captive constituencies that feel compelled to support candidates that they deem the lessers of two evils. Sheepdogs may advocate their strategy before exiting the electoral contest, which could occur because of disqualification (including unsuccessful primary elections), or retraction of candidacy, as was advocated by Sanders before his 2016 disqualification. Stein more than tripled her nationwide vote count, compared to the 2012 result, up to 1,457,218 votes; and doing the same in California, receiving 278,657 votes. In the 2018 congressional elections, which utilized non-partisan blanket, \\"top two\\" primaries, three Green Party candidates advanced to the general elections. This was the first year that any Green candidates advanced since the implementation of the top-two primary after 2010. In the 13th congressional district (San Francisco and Alameda counties), Laura Wells advanced from a six candidate primary, and received 34,257 votes in the general election, 11.6%. In the 34th congressional district (Los Angeles County, California,) Kenneth Mejia advanced from a three candidate primary, and received 41,711 votes in the general election, 27.5%. In the 40th congressional district (Los Angeles County, California,) Rodolfo Cortes-Barragan advanced from the primary, and received 27,511 votes in the general election, 22.7%. Each faced off against Democratic party incumbent opponents in the general elections.

It sits on a hillside above the river Esarulo, a tributary of the Serchio. The town is renowned for the band Filarmonica Alpina, founded in 1858 with the name of Fanfara popolare. History The origin of the town dates back to a Roman castra, called Castrum Leonis, (\\"Lion's Castle\\"), built to command the valley that leads to the San Pellegrino Pass, the easiest access for armies over the Apennines. The fortress later developed under the Lombard and Frank dominations. In 1170 it was besieged by the Republic of Lucca. Castiglione surrendered, but the high taxes imposed led the city to form a league with other communes of Garfagnana against Lucca. In 1227 Castiglione was again besieged and suffered further destruction by Lucchese soldiers. Political conflicts continued in the following years, until a peace was reached in 1371: Lucca gained definitive control of Castiglione, and established a permanent administrator. The defensive structure was upgraded with the widening of the town walls. During the 15th century Castiglione was one of the few communities in Garfagnana that did not submit to the Este family, instead remaining loyal to the Republic of Lucca. Throughout the wars against the Estensi, the fortress was again besieged, in particular in 1603 and 1613. There then followed a long period of peace, marred only by boundary disputes with the neighbouring communes. The Congress of Vienna (1815) assigned Castiglione to Marie Louise of Bourbon, Grand Duchess of Lucca, who in 1819 gave it to Francis IV of Modena. Main sights Castiglione's most striking attraction is the Medieval bridge built by Spinetta Malaspina in the 13th century. The town is also famous for its well-preserved 13th-century medieval walls with large towers (the Torrioni) and the castle (Rocca). The church of San Pietro was erected in 723 by two Lombard brothers, Aurinand and Gudifrid, but was largely rebuilt in the 12th century by Bishop Guido III of Lucca. San Michele (14th century) is the other main holy building of the town. Both churches use wall towers as their belfries. The Church of San Pellegrino (in the frazione of the same name), at and commanding the valley of the Serchio river, houses the mortal remains of St. Pellegrino and St. Bianco. The town has a panoramic vista over the valley below.

He learnt to swim at eight in his hometown of Leeds, England at the public bath house. He could afford to swim there once a week, on 'dirty water days', when it only cost a penny. Otherwise, he swam in the outdoor sluiceways that drained from the wool mills. He became England's boy champion at 9 and a senior champion at 14. In his early 20s, he emigrated penniless to North America, with his International Swimming Hall of Fame biography stating: Matt Mann with University of Michigan swimmers, 1950 > Matt emigrated steerage to the USA, was stopped at Ellis Island for > insufficient funds, shipped to Toronto in a sealed railroad car with $2.00 > left in his pocket.

He was Head Coach of the US Men's Swimming Team at the 1952 Summer Olympics. He was one of the twenty-one people to be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame when it was formed in 1965; he was one of only two coaches (with Robert Kiphuth) and two Britons (with English Channel swimmer Captain Matthew Webb) to be inducted. Coach Mann was the founder and owner of the first ever sport-specific summer camp. He purchased land along a lake in Canada and opened a boys swim camp, Camp Chikopi, in 1920. Many coaching peers and friends would attend the summer camp and a number of Olympic athletes (at least thirty by 1965) from many nations trained and developed there. Coach Mann and his wife, Lea (Block) Mann, operated Camp Chikopi until Matt's death in 1962. In 1961 the Michigan Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association (MISCA) honored Matt Mann by creating an award in his honor. The award is presented annually to a swim coach who demonstrates continued leadership, contributions, and service to Michigan High School Swimming.

After General Mohamed Oufkir's 1972 assassination, he became Hassan II's right-hand man. He was promoted to General during the Green March in 1975, and took charge of the Moroccan Armed Forces in the Southern Zone, where the military were fighting the Polisario Front. Ahmed Dlimi was also a member of the royal Military Council and in charge of the Army's security service abroad. He died in January 1983, officially in a car crash, although allegations have been made that he was assassinated. He was accused of being responsible for the death of Mehdi Ben Barka in November 1965. Early life Dlimi comes from a family originally from Zaggota, a village near Had Kourt in the Chrarda region that is administratively part of Sidi Kacem Province. His father, Lahcen Dlimi, was an informant for the French colonial authorities and held a subaltern position in the French intelligence agency the SDECE. It was reported that it was Lahcen Dlimi who co-opted Mohammed Oufkir for a job in the colonial administration in the late 1940s. After the independence of Morocco, he briefly married the daughter of a minister, Messaoud Chiguer. Then married a daughter of another minister, Bousselham. This event opened the doors of the highest power circles for Dlimi, who was then a simple young officer in the army. Through his father Ahmed Dlimi was also related to Oufkir. Fatima Chenna, the wife of Oufkir and daughter of colonel Chenna, was related to Lahcen Dlimi through her mother.  Before the Green March  Ahmed Dlimi headed the Moroccan security services and played an important role as a military supporter of King Hassan II during the Years of lead. A collaborator of Interior Minister Mohamed Oufkir, he was accused of numerous human rights violations. He was reportedly connected to the \\"disappearance\\" of the exiled opposition leader Mehdi Ben Barka, leader of the left-wing National Union of Popular Forces (UNPF) and of the non-aligned Tricontinental Conference, in 1965, in Paris, FranceEnglish account of revelations made in 2000 in Le Monde concerning the Ben Barka Affair Interview with Bachir Ben Barka Morocco: Officer reveals CIA's role in Murder , The Irish Times, August 8, 2001 According to the first judicial investigation, Ahmed Dlimi was in Paris, along with General Oufkir, at the time of Ben Barka's kidnapping. Mehdi Ben Barka, quarante ans apr√®s, RFI, 29 October 2005 Former dissident and prisoner Ali Bourequat has also directly accused Dlimi of taking part in Ben Barka's assassination. Ali Bourequat, In the Moroccan King's Secret Garden, Maurice Publishers, 1998 After two failed coup attempts in 1971 and 1972 (the latter of which involved the assistance of General Oufkir), Dlimi was entrusted with increasingly important tasks and promoted to the rank of General. He eventually replaced Oufkir as right-hand man to Hassan II. Some sources claim that he personally executed his superior, General Mohamed Oufkir, on the orders of the King, after Oufkir was found responsible for the coup d'√©tat of 1972.Jerry Meldon, Our Man in Morocco, Consortium News, September 17, 1999  After 1975  After the Green March in 1975, during which Morocco annexed Western Sahara, a former administrative part of Spanish Morocco, General Dlimi became head of staff of the Moroccan Armed Forces in this territory. Western Sahara was then claimed both by Morocco and by the Polisario Front, which initiated a guerrilla against Rabat. In 1980, Dlimi initiated the construction of a wall, stating it was to protect the annexed Western Sahara from the Polisario's attacks. The latter became increasingly restricted to its base, Tindouf, in Algeria. Ahmed Dlimi was increasingly viewed as the main military strongman of Morocco. However, in January 1983, he was killed in a car accident just after meeting the King in his palace at Marrakech. However, there are allegations that he was assassinated after attempting to organize a coup against King Hassan II,Exit Hasan of Morocco: west mourns the death of another loyal servant Morocco: Breaking the Wall of Silence 1993 report from Amnesty International (AI Index: MDE 29/01/93) or that he was killed for having become too powerful, and a threat to the monarchy.The Morocco of Muhammad VI, The Estimate, July 30, 1999 The assassination theory has been supported by dissident Ahmed Rami in March 1983, who exiled himself to Sweden after the failed coup of 1972 in which he had taken part. Rami alleged that he had clandestinely met with Dlimi in Stockholm in December 1982, and that they were preparing a coup against Hassan II, due for July 1983. Ahmed Rami, Le destin du g√©n√©ral Dlimi Dlimi was allegedly part of the \\"Independent Officers\\" who intended to overthrow the monarchy, in order to put an end to the regime's corruption and human rights violations. They aimed to establish a \\"Democratic Arab Islamic Republic of Morocco\\" and to negotiate with the Polisario Front. According to Ahmed Rami, several young military officers were arrested mid-January 1983. Dlimi himself was also arrested, interrogated and tortured in the royal palace, before his death being set up as a car-crash. Dlimi is said to have advocated a closer relationship to France in order to counter US influence. Rami wrote that: \\"Hassan's closest circle, which also counts foreign secret agents, very well knows the circumstances of Dlimi's death.\\" This veiled allusion to the CIA was elaborated upon by Rami, who claimed that the CIA was investigating Dlimi as a secret member of the \\"Independent Officers\\"; that they had filmed the Stockholm meeting between them, and had ultimately delivered this video to Hassan II. William Blum, Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, revised edition (Common Courage Press) Morocco was at the time a very close ally of the United States. Hassan II had sent troops to Zaire in 1977 and 1978 to support US intervention, and also assisted UNITA in Angola since the mid-1970s. He had agreed to the setting up of a CIA station in Morocco, which became one of its key installations in Africa. Hassan II had visited US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and the State Secretary Al Haig in 1981, as well as the president of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the Deputy Director of the CIA. After Dlimi's death, fifteen other officers were arrested and three of them executed. No one was allowed to see Ahmed Dlimi's corpse.

Boogert 1997 plate I) Mohammed Awzal (Berber: M·∏•emmed U ∆êli U Brahim Ak ∑bil Awzal en Yinduzal; 1680‚Äì1749) is the most important author in the literary tradition of the Tashlehit-Berber language. He was born around 1680 in the village of al-Qa·π£aba (Elqe·π£ba) in tribal territory of the Induzal, in the region of Sus in Morocco and died in 1749. His full name in Arabic is Mu·∏•ammad ibn  øAlƒ´ ibn IbrƒÅhƒ´m al-Akbƒ´lƒ´ al- HawzƒÅlƒ´ (or al-Ind≈´zƒÅlƒ´) al-S≈´sƒ´. He is the author of several works in Berber and Arabic which are preserved in manuscripts. Life and works There are few hard facts about Awzal's life. He may have killed somebody from his tribe when he was young and this may have been the reason for him to seek refuge in Tamegroute, a village known for an ancient sanctuary, where he started his religious studies. It was probably towards the end of his studies that he wrote in Arabic, as an essay, his first work, Mahamiz al-Ghaflan. After some time he came back to his place of origin, putting himself at the disposal of the family of the murder victim. They could have taken revenge on him but instead, convinced of the sincerity of his conversion and of his new choice of life, they forgave him. Life, however, was not always easy in his village as his preachings were not popular. It seems that in reaction to such resistance he composed his second work, in Arabic, the Tanbih (\\"Admonition\\"). When he returned to Tamegroute his master, Sheikh Ahmad, recognising his talent as a poet, supported the writing of his first work in Shilha, entitled Al-·∏§aw·∏ç \\"The Reservoir\\". This work, divided in two parts ( øibƒÅdƒÅt and mu øƒÅmalƒÅt) like other works on Islamic law, is a complete legal manual according to the Maliki school. Its main sources are two classical texts, the  øAqƒ´dat ahl al-taw·∏•ƒ´d by Mu·∏•ammad ibn Y≈´suf al-San≈´sƒ´ (for the first chapter of part 1 which deals with theology), and the Mukhta·π£ar by Khalƒ´l ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq al-Jundƒ´ (for all other chapters of both part). His following work, Ba·∏•r al-Dum≈´ ø \\"The Ocean of Tears\\", an exhortation in verse and treatise on eschatology. This is probably the best known text by Al Awzal and a masterpiece of Berber literature. It can be found as a manuscript in the most important libraries and private collections. The text has been translated into French by B.H. Stricker and Ars√®ne Roux and into English by N. van den Boogert. Probably at the time of writing \\"The Ocean of Tears\\", 1714), the poet had already returned for a last time to his village of birth, where he worked as a teacher and a mufti until his death. He left a daughter and a son, B·πõahim. The dating of his last and shorter work in Berber is uncertain, al-Na·π£ƒ´·∏•ah \\"The Advice\\", is an ode in praise of Sidi (Saint) A·∏•mad ibn Mu·∏•ammad ibn NƒÅ·π£ir, Awzal's spiritual guide and grand master of the NƒÅ·π£irƒ´yah Sufi order (founded by his grandfather), probably inspired as a funeral eulogy by his death, around 1708. Almost a third of all known Shilha manuscripts contain parts of his works, and the largest Berber text in existence is a commentary by al-Hasan al-Tamuddizti (d. 1898) on Awzal's al-Hawd. Awzal, in his honor, is also the name of rhymed couplets and long poems that Ishilhin women chant daily or weekly, between the afternoon and sunset Islamic obligatory prayer times, in the tomb complexes of local holy figures.

This section runs from the Worsley Interchange (what is now Junction 13 of the M60) as far as the junction with the A56 at Chester Road (now junction 7 of the M60). This section includes the Barton High Level Bridge, a bridge over the Manchester Ship Canal. The embankments for the bridge were the first physical step towards the construction of any motorway in the UK. With the extension of the M62 west to Liverpool, the section from the Eccles Interchange down to Stretford was redesignated M63. The junctions were numbered in the opposite direction to the current M60 numbering, with M63 junction 1 being the Eccles Interchange, running to junction 7 at Chester Road. Originally there was no junction 6. Developments in the late 1980s In 1986, work began on two major schemes on the route. The first involved the construction of the A6144(M) motorway, and a new junction and parallel link roads for the M63. The new junction was numbered as junction 6 (now junction 8 of the M60). The new junction forced the closure of junction 5, which served Urmston and the B5213, due to the small gap between the two. The second involved the widening of the motorway between the Eccles Interchange and junction 3 (now junction 9 of the M60), including the Barton motorway bridge, which was a major engineering feat. =Sale Eastern and Northenden bypass= This section of motorway was the third section of the motorway completed, opening as the M63 in September 1974, just 8 months after the section of the Sharston bypass opened. The route largely followed the lightly developed valley and flood planes of the River Mersey, so much of the motorway was on a raised embankment to be clear of potential floodwater. Some of the excavated land for the embankment allowed construction of Sale Water Park, which is adjacent to the motorway. The section of motorway ran from what was then junction 7 at Chester Road (A56) to the recently completed Kingsway Interchange with the A34, what was then junction 10 of the M63 (now junction 3/4 of the M60). A major free-flow junction was provided for the A5103 Princess Parkway, which provided links towards the city of Manchester and the M56 motorway. =Sharston bypass= The layout of the Kingsway Interchange which opened in 1974 as part of the Sharston bypass scheme, originally junction 10 of the M63, with the M63 since having been renumbered to M60. This section of motorway was the second section completed, opening as the M63 (and part as the M56 motorway) in January 1974. It was only a short section, running from what is now junction 2 of the M56 to junction 2 of the M60 (then junction 11 of the M63), but it included a very large free-flow junction providing links to the M56 and A34. =Stockport East-West bypass= By 1974, the motorway had reached the outskirts of Stockport, running onto the congested A560. The Stockport East-West bypass opened to traffic in July 1982 as far as the Portwood Roundabout, then junction 13 of the M63, now junction 27 of the M60. A significant feature of the bypass is where the motorway passes through two of the arches of the large railway viaduct in the centre of Stockport (one of the largest brick-built structures in Europe). In much of the cutting on the eastern side of the viaduct, red sandstone, on which much of the town is built, can be seen very close to the motorway. The section of motorway was widened from two to three lane carriageways in 1999 and 2000, around the time when the M63 was renumbered to M60. =Portwood to Brinnington= This scheme was part of a wider scheme, which involved the construction of a section of what was then the M66 motorway as far as the junction with the A57 and M67 motorway. The M63 was extended eastwards from the Portwood roundabout to a junction at Brinnington, opening in April 1989. The complete scheme intended for the M63 to continue east from Brinnington to join the A560 at Hattersley, and for the M66 to continue south becoming A6(M) motorway, forming a Stockport North-South bypass. However, the remaining plans for the M63 were subsequently abandoned, and the southern extension, although it still exists at the planning stage in an altered and downgraded form, has yet to be built. The junction at Brinnington (now junction 25 of the M60, then junction 15 of the M63) left room for both the extension to the east and the A6(M) to be constructed. As a result, the entry to junction 25 in the anti- clockwise direction is from the outside lane, and the carriageways passing through this junction have sharp corners on the M60 main-line, as these were originally intended to be slip roads. In the clockwise direction the motorway is now subject to a reduced speed limit through the junction. The current plans for the North-South bypass do not intend to complete the junction as originally intended, or to utilise stubs of the slip roads already constructed in preparation.SEMMS New Relief Road Scheme This section was widened from two to three lane carriageways along with the Stockport East-West Bypass in 1999 and 2000. Signage legacy A sign still showing M63 in Trafford in July 2007, despite the road being re- numbered in 1999 Despite the M63 being renumbered in 1999 to M60, many roadsigns still existed pointing travellers to the M63 until late 2005. There is still at least one M63 sign. One existed on the roundabout Redclyffe Circle near the Trafford Centre stating \\"Stockport M63, Carrington\\", but this was replaced with an M60 sign in the period 2012-2014.http://goo.gl/maps/cpvrG There were also two signs on Manchester Road, Wilmslow, which remained until at least April 2013. Another sign could be found on Trafford Road, Salford Quays across the road from Exchange Quay. There was another sign, which could be found at the roundabout joining Alderley Road in Wilmslow. This sign was still in place in June 2016,https://goo.gl/maps/oBWBQwWGmVH2 but has since been removed.

During the early nineties, the video game Street Fighter was very popular in the Philippines. A local publishing company (INFINITY) created a comics parody of the game entitled Kick Fighter. Biotrog created by Jojo Ende Jr. and Gilbert Monsanto was one of the characters that appeared in this weekly comics magazine. Biotrog - Kick Fighter Biotrog is a cyborg vigilante that prowls the crime infested city that he is in. Haunted by the murder of his parents, Biotrog patrols against organized crime and other super-powered beings. =Origin: The Forgotten Past= When he was still a child, Biotrog's parents were involved in an ambush. The story goes that Biotrog's father was a cop named Remy Summers who was working on a miscellaneous case. One night, someone called the precinct he was assigned to, looking for him. Thinking nothing about it, his friend (Bert Hanes - also Biotrog's godfather) told the caller that Remy had just left with his family for a vacation, unknowingly handing his friends' life to the hands of an evil syndicate (KF#18). And so, the family was ambushed by the syndicate's enforcers. They torched the car and left the family for dead. Not knowing that the young Biotrog was still alive. Unknown to the gunmen a Chinese ex-monk turned scientist, Dr. Wang, witnessed what has transpired. The man was there looking at the site of his new lab and has heard the explosion they have caused. And while the culprits escaped, Dr. Wang was able to save Biotrog. Biotrog's face was badly damaged though. And his (right) arm and legs were amputated in order to save his life. Dr. Wang however, replaced this damaged body parts with high-tech cybernetic artificial organs. Only a postcard that contained the name \\"Roger\\" was found along with Biotrog. And because of his bionic body parts, Dr. Wang termed him Biotrog or Bio- Electronic Roger (KF#6) which was later retconned to Bio-Technological Roger (KF#50). =Hero With A Silver Mask= With the help of Dr. Wang, Biotrog grew up to an honest and kind man. However, his face was so damaged that he had to wear a silver mask whenever he went out of their home. Although disfigured, he has overcome self-pity and is able to help others. On one occasion, Biotrog's encountered a jumper. Believing that no one would ever love him because of his appearance, the man attempted to commit suicide. Biotrog was able to stop him though and upon learning the cause of the man's anguish, showed him his face. Upon seeing this, the man realized his mistake and decided to continue on living (KF#8). =Rogues Gallery= Throughout the comics, Biotrog crossed path with several nemesis - some are super-powered, some are normal human beings placed in not-so-normal circumstances. The following profiles these enemies and their encounters with our masked hero. The Syndicate Early on the comics, Biotrog was plagued with mind-splitting head-aches whenever he remembers things from his past. He is haunted by a symbol depicting a Hawk's head‚Äîthe symbol used by the syndicate that killed his parents (KF#6). On one occasion, Biotrog encounters a group having the same symbol. He confides this to Dr. Wang and they realized that the syndicate has two factions. The group that Biotrog encountered had the symbol in their chest while those that Dr. Wang saw ambush his parents had it in the left arm. It was during the night of the Summers' murder that the syndicate was divided. Iron Claw and his twin brother Ripper fought over the leadership of the organization. Ripper was the current leader of the syndicate but Iron Claw was ambitious. Ripper was finally able to defeat Iron Claw. Although wounded, Iron Claw survived. And as he left the organization, some of its members left with him (KF#15). *Ripper - leads the original syndicate (symbol in left arm). His main weapon are two samurais. It is also assumed that he has the ability for long distance hypnotism (KF#21). *Iron Claw - leads the syndicate's splinter group (symbol in chest) and has a knack for robbing banks (KF#26-27). The Red Ninja On a usual night patrol, Biotrog encounters a mysterious Red Ninja who seems to challenge him for no reason at all. Although an enemy, the Red Ninja allows Biotrog to escape in order to help a woman in danger. Once the fight resumes, Biotrog is able to defeat him. However, before landing more blows on the, Dr. Wang stops the fight and reveals the true identity of the Ninja‚Äîan android created to test Biotrog's skills. (KF#14) Biolante: The Prototype After answering a disturbance, Biotrog encounters a mysterious man wielding the same cybernetic claws as his. However, this one had a fiery disposition. Although the two fought, the man escaped. Upon consultation with Dr. Wang, Biotrog learns the man's name Biolante, the first bionic man created by Dr. Wang. Biotrog views him somewhat as brother. On the other hand, Biolante wants to be one-of-a-kind and wants to kill him (KF#11). Although unsuccessful in his attempts, Biolante appears whenever Biotrog is in danger ‚Äì much to Biotrog's surprise. The man reasons that if Biotrog will be killed, he will be the one who does it (KF#19). The fights between the two have escalated so much that at one time, Biotrog cut his own arm in order to save himself from Biolante (KF#20). The Monster With No-Face When Biotrog's master, Dr. Wang warned his fellow scientists about the hazards they are doing to the environment, the men just laughed at him and called him paranoid and mad. The scientists reasoned that they have already invented gadgets that will help clean the environment. Not known to them, a new mud-like creature emerged from the wastes that their new gadgets created. The creature encountered Biotrog while he was on patrol. Attacking him with sonic waves/screams, Biotrog had no choice but to fight back. However, the creature's molecular structure was so unstable that Biotrog's attacks and weapons had no effect. It was only by freezing the creature that it was finally stopped. Biotrog brought the creature back to their base of operations for containment (KF#17) but it was only a matter of time before the creature was able to escape. During the battle, Biotrog again was overpowered by the creature who used his sonic blasts. However, Biotrog discovered that aside from freezing the creature, it could also be defeated by fire. Using some explosive shurikens, Biotrog was able to defeat the creature (KF#55). Lethal Ninja: Mr. Grey Over the years, Biotrog has turned from a vigilante to an unofficial contact of the police. He has helped capture criminals and solve cases in the city. On one occasion Biotrog was asked to help in guarding the transportation of a murderer named Edmund Grey. Biotrog learned that the Mr. Grey murdered some people as an act of revenge. The people whom Grey killed have stolen from his family and have even raped his two daughters. Although Grey had first let the police handle the case, he found the wheels of justice too slow and had taken the law into his own hands. While on transport, Grey was able to perform an escape. And even though Biotrog pursued him, Grey proved to be a very clever individual and was able to vanish (KF#28). Some time after, Grey reappeared as a mysterious Black Ninja. Employing master level ninja skills, the ninja was able to defeat Biotrog and told him to blame his master if he is going to die. But before he could finally get to Biotrog, Dr. Wang, disguised as Red Ninja appeared and defeated him (KF#32). This however, did not stop Grey from going on with his path of revenge - kidnapping government officials and assassinating cops and businessmen. These activities did not go unnoticed to Biotrog, in fact, some of these have been done in front of him and Biotrog was unable to stop Mr. Grey (KF#35). On one occasion, Iron Claw was able to contact Mr. Grey and offered an alliance against Biotrog. With Grey's brains and Iron Claw's resources the two proved to be a good team and was successful in capturing Biotrog. However, once Biotrog, Grey and Iron Claw was in same room, Mr. Grey betrayed Iron Claw, saying that the reason he brought Biotrog was to get rid of Iron Claw. This revealed that Grey believed what he was doing and that he had a sick sense of honor and justice (kF#36-37). The final battle between the two occurred when Grey tricked Biotrog and was able to capture him. Although, he did not want to hurt the innocent, he viewed Biotrog as a threat. However, it was Grey who was tricked as it was the Red Ninja posing as Biotrog who he has captured. Biotrog appeared shortly and they fought. When it was clear that Biotrog would win the battle, Grey conceded (KF#40-41). Vowing to stop his revenge, he left the duty of bringing the rest of his enemies to justice to Biotrog. Though reluctant at first Biotrog accepted. Grey has seen the light and was really sorry about what he has done. While on prison, Grey learned about an escape attempt and reported to the authorities. The attempt failed and Grey suffered the consequences of his actions. On Grey's deathbed, Biotrog learned about his final heroic acts (KF#42). =Allies: Part Of The Family= Bernard Grey Although believing the remorse of Mr. Grey to be true, Biotrog did not believe that the clever man would die that easily and on one night, visited Mr. Grey's grave. What he saw surprised him, Mr. Grey was there standing in front of his own grave. He confronted him but before they could exchange words, Ripper appeared. Unknown to them, Ripper was there to destroy the remains of Mr. Grey as payback. Though at odds with Iron Claw at one time, Ripper wanted to avenge his brother's death (KF#43). Ripper attempted to attack Grey but the man proved to be battle ready. He then revealed that he is in fact, not Edmund Grey but Bernard - Grey's twin (KF#42). Bernard is also clever like his brother. On one occasion he has helped deal with kid bank robbers by posing as the driver for their escape. While on the way, Bernard released a gas that knocked the robbers cold (KF#46). Angel After some time, Biotrog came across a female vigilante called Angel who surprising saved him from a pinch (KF#10). The female ninja is after a foreign terrorist organization called War Claws. Surprisingly, Angel turns out to be another scientist named Dianne Mendoza. His father invented a secret formula called Formula 1700 which the War Claws stole after killing him. (KF#29) The two started out with an awkward relationship, Biotrog believing that he had no future ahead of him and had nothing to offer was being distant. Although they told each other about the tragic parts of their lives, the two did not know each other's secret identity (KF#38). When Angel learned the location of War Claws, she asked Biotrog for help. On this mission, Biotrog was caught in an explosion in order to save Angel. It is also in this mission, that Angel sees the man behind the mask. Biotrog was saved by his bionic parts but the doctors (not knowing Biotrog's history) said they could do nothing about his deformed face. It was during his time that Angel, volunteered to fix Biotrog's face with her technology. She would do this for the man he loves (KF#47). =The New Identity= During this time, it was Bernard who posed as Biotrog while the latter was recovering from the incident and from the operation that Angel is performing. Bernard has earned the trust of Biotrog and has entrusted him with the duties. And according to Dr. Wang, Bernard was playful but he passed as Biotrog (KF#49). As Biotrog, Bernard uses the same weapon's as Roger. However, Bernard's cybernetic claws are releasable. This proves to be great assets in his battles as Bernard has no bionic parts (KF#51). Once Roger was able to recover, Bernard gave the mantle of Biotrog back to him and turned his sights to the Red Ninja. Some time after the operation, Biotrog had some disturbing dreams where he was asked about who he was. The person who was asking said that who he was just some information he was told. Biotrog thought it was Biolante but was surprised to learn that who he was fighting was himself. They fought and Biotrog was defeated, his mask punched away from his face. He told him that Biotrog had forgotten who he really was. The other Biotrog removed his mask and revealed Roger's originally deformed face. He said Biotrog hid his true appearance and asked him if they are still same person. They fought again and the other Biotrog destroyed his bionic parts, leaving him helpless and unable to move. =Promises Fulfilled= Some time after, Angel tells Biotrog that she received information regarding the whereabouts of War Claws. Upon arriving on War Claws' hideout, Biotrog notices some familiar faces. He remembers the promise he has made to Mr. Grey and realizes that they are the enemies Grey has been searching for. Angel tells him that those were some former cops who has turned to crime. In the battle that ensued, Biotrog and Angel were able to wipe out the entire operations of War Claws. Biotrog was able to fulfill his promise to Mr. Grey (KF#53) and Angel was able to retrieve the formula her father had developed. =The New Enemies= Poison Ivy During one of Angel's speaking engagement as Dianne Mendoza, Biotrog and Red Ninja (Bernard Grey) was tasked to guard the scientists attending. Dianne was going to unveil the formula that was created by her father. According to her Formula 1700 is going to end all diseases. However, before she could continue, some of the remaining War Claws attacked. Leading the group is a woman named Poison Ivy whose main weapon is a fan that can eject blades at her opponents. The group attempted to take Formula 1700 from Dianne but Biotrog and Red Ninja were there to stop them. While Poison Ivy was busy dealing with Biotrog and Red Ninja, Dianne was able to change to her Angel armor. And together the three heroes defeated the group (KF#57). Brothers: The Return Of Biolante Unknown to them at a hidden corner of the room, Biolante was watching. The man was supposed to be dead after Biotrog cut his own arm when Biolante refused to let go and attempted to take Biotrog in a fall (KF#20). Biotrog and Dr. Wang were even the ones who laid him to rest. During his return, Biolante exhibited some sort of dual personality and ironically now wears a mask (Biotrog can now walk outside without his own mask). Biolante's return did not go unnoticed. To make sure that it was really Biolante who mas running amuck, Biotrog (as Roger) and Bernard went and visited Biolante's resting place. The grave was dug up or someone dug out of the grave. Soon after, the two were attacked by Biolante who at that time did not recognize either of them. He told them to tell Biotrog that he is issuing a challenge (KF#66). When Roger returned as Biotrog, the two finally squared off. Biolante exhibiting some new moves and a Beta Beam firing from both his eyes. When he got the chance, Biotrog used his silver mask to reflect the beam back to Biolante who was knocked unconscious, but was suddenly transported away by some unknown force (KF#67). Some time after, Biolante contacted Biotrog in order to finish their business once and for all. He told Biotrog the real reason why he hated him so much. He was Dr. Wang's first protege and was introduced to Roger soon after his rescue. He grew up and was assigned as an assassin for an international intelligence unit. He was loyal but as soon as he failed a mission, he was sent to jail and cast aside even by Dr. Wang, a person he views as a father. He also told Biotrog that Dr. Wang erased all of Biotrog's memory regarding him. But before any more explanation can happen, Biolante was not able to contain his anger and attacked. Although Biotrog had the upper hand, Biolante soon revealed his trump card. The real cause of his resurrection was an alien entity that possessed his corpse. With this alien entity fighting with him, Biotrog's bionic strength was no match. It was only with the intervention of Dr. Wang that Biolante decided to stop and leave his revenge for another day (KF#61). Koji Ripper invited an assassin named Koji to help him defeat Biotrog. But as it turns out Koji was there to not only kill Biotrog but also kill Ripper himself. A task which he accomplished flawlessly. And using intimidation, Koji was able to take control of Ripper's organization. The next day, Biotrog was called by the police to help investigate a crime scene. Upon arriving Biotrog was shocked to find Ripper's dead body hanging on the wall. Red Ninja who tagged along noticed that the wall clock had the wrong time and immediately asked everyone to get out. They were barely outside before a huge explosion from the room erupted (KF#58). The next time Koji made an attempt on Biotrog's life was when he had one of his men rescued by Biotrog from a supposed stab wound. The man while on transport to the hospital planted a bomb on Biotrog's motorcycle. Much to their dismay when Biotrog grew suspicious and was not on the motorcycle when Koji detonated it (KF#46). This caused Biotrog to finally decide to take out Koji and the remains of Ripper's syndicate. With the help of Red Ninja, they were able to trick Koji into thinking that they were going to infiltrate his stronghold. Koji decided to blow his hideout when Biotrog and Red Ninja were sure to be inside. And while Koji and his group waited outside contemplating their victory, Biotrog and Red Ninja appeared with some cops in tail. Not accepting defeat, Koji challenged Biotrog and during the ensuing confrontation lost his left foot via Biotrog's cybernetic claws (KF#70-71). The Black King Unknown to them a new syndicate has been formed. Led by a man known only as the Black King, the group's membership is solely based on the pieces of the game of Chess. It includes the beautiful and dangerous Black Queen‚Äîwhether she is the king's lover or just a follower is not known, two former bishops that have turned to crime, two sadistic killers as knights and the eight newly recruited men as pawns (KF#62). The group's first task is to eliminate the vigilante known as Biotrog. Unknown to them, one of the group's member is really not in league with them. And as the two knights who were sent to kill Biotrog prepared to finish the task, ahurikens thrown from somewhere stopped them. And because of the diversion, Biotrog was able to stop and defeat them (KF#64). Some time after, the group baited Biotrog with a false tip so that they can capture him. Unfortunately for them, Biotrog wanted to be captured and as soon as he has escaped from his binds, Biotrog proceeded to take them out. However, Black King had an ace up his sleeves. He released some poisonous gas when Biotrog was close enough. He left Biotrog to die but soon discovered that that was a huge mistake. As it turns out, the traitor in their organization fed Biotrog the antidote to the poison. Biotrog went after them and was able to stop their activities (KF#82). The Resurrection Of No-Face When a man turns up dead on a gallery, Biotrog investigates to find mud-like substance all over the crime scene - and only one creature comes to his mind, No-face. It seems that Biotrog was not able to fully destroy the creature with fire the last time they met and it was able to reform itself. Biotrog along with Angel goes back to crime scene to investigate further but soon finds out that Biotrog's initial hypothesis is true. Same as their battles before, Biotrog is powerless against the creature's physiology. He also cannot freeze the creature or use his explosive shurikens since the creature has captured Angel. As fate would have it, Biotrog is able to find a fire hose and blast the creature with water, dissolving it. Biotrog and Angel then brings the creature's remains back to the base for containment (KF#78). Several weeks later, Dr. Wang had come to the conclusion that the remains of No-face can now be safely disposed. With Biotrog, they went to the edge of town where they disposed the liquid remains of No-Face. However, an escaped prisoner happened upon the area. Thirsty from the police-chase, the prisoner drunk from the river where some of No-Face's remains rested. Moments later, the prisoner lost consciousness. When he awoke, he was shocked to see that he was transformed into No-Face. Along with the appearance, he also inherited No-Face's dislike towards Biotrog (KF#84). With No-Face's memories, he was able to find Biotrog's lair and attacked. Fortunately, Dr. Wang had a flame thrower lying around. He torched No-Face, not realizing that someone was trapped inside (KF#85). When Angel finds dried blood on the surface of No-Face's body, Dr. Wang decided to test the creature. During the tests the creature regained consciousness and for a while had the personality of its human host. Biotrog and Dr. Wang were shocked as the creature spoke but were even more shocked with the creatures new strength as it escaped. Dr. Wang had realized that the creature had a human host and asked Biotrog to find the creature (KF#87). During their encounter, Biotrog used nitrogen capsules to freeze No-Face. To his surprise the prisoner that No-Face bonded with asked for his help. He however could do nothing but bring back the frozen creature to their base as they still had no idea how to separate the two (KF#88). =Bernard Grey: Black Ninja= Bernard receives a package from his parents. But as it turns out, this was an attempt on his life by his enemies in Japan. The package contains Ninja Death Powder, a substance that can cause instantaneous death to anyone who touches it. Biotrog offers his help but Bernard declines saying that Biotrog is needed where he is right now. Soon after, Bernard leaves to face his enemies in Japan (KF#76). =Triple Threat: Biotrog vs. Biolante vs. Koji= While in prison, Koji had nothing in his mind but Biotrog. He wished to once and for all destroy his enemy. As if fate intervened, Koji's wishes were about to come true because hovering above the city is an alien spacecraft containing the same alien specie that resurrected Biolante. Using their advanced technology, Koji was transported to the alien craft where his foot was replaced with cybernetic parts. The alien intended to make him his slave like Biolante to his brother. Koji refused and was able to escape, damaging the space craft and killing the alien creature in the process (KF#79). Biolante on the other hand was turning a new leaf. While Biotrog was on patrol on another part of the city, Angel was battling the War Claws. Due to the sheer number of her opponents, Angel was defeated and captured. But before they could do anything else to the woman, someone appeared and took out her enemies. At first, Angel thought it was Biotrog but it turns out to be Biolante. He explains that it is Biotrog who is his enemy and not her. Angel offers that he return to the side of the law, but Biolate says that the law has no longer any room for him (KF#80). When it came to the time that Koji finally confronted Biotrog, Biolante was also there to inflict some damage. Unfortunately for Koji, Biolante doesn't want Biotrog to be killed by anyone rather that him so he watches Biotrog's back from Koji's attack. This doesn't mean that he didn't attack Biotrog in the process. In the end, Koji decided to eliminate the two but by this time, Biotrog and Biolante decided to make their fight a draw and get rid of Koji instead (KF#86). To get back at Biotrog, Koji sold drugs while pretending to be Biotrog to damage his name. Biotrog was quick in thwarting his plans though, as when Koji thought that he had finally won, Biotrog appeared and defeated him (KF#91). Koji realizing that he isn't any match for Biotrog in his current state asked for help from the dark arts. His prayers were answered by a dark deity who gave him telekenesis (KF#93). On a nightly patrol, Biotrog received a telepathic message from Biolante. And when they found each other, the two instantly fought. Biolante provoked Biotrog to chase him. Biotrog seeing the new quickness in his opponent became suspicious. His suspicions were confirmed, when Biolante was not affected by some gas he had released. He realized that it is not the real Biolante and destroyed it. It was an android created by Biolante with the help of the alien that was bonded to him to lure Biotrog into a trap (KF#89). Not satisfied with his defeat, Biolante sent another android disguised as the late Mr. Grey to kill Biotrog. However, like the previous battle, Biotrog was able to realize the difference in his enemies and was able to defeat it (KF#90). Ironically, Biolante needed the help of Biotrog when he was captured by a cult that attempted to sacrifice him (KF#93). After some time, Biolante became fed up with the alien who was instructing him to create more androids to kill his enemies. Biolante said that if anyone will be killed, he will be the one who does it. The alien fought back and Biolante who was naturally hot-tempered, destroyed the alien's computers and apparatuses. He had already decided to kill himself to finally shut the alien up. He injured his hand and the alien was able to get out, only to be welcomed by an explosion due to the damage created by Biolante. The alien was no longer able to reform itself and some of its DNA mixed with Biolante's blood (KF#94). Now free from the alien, Biolante turned his sights to Koji who was always meddling with his affairs. Unknown to him, Koji had decided on the same thing. It is easy for two who are looking for one another to cross paths. When this time came, Biolante and Koji fought ferociously, first with their fists and blades. Biolante wielding that same cybernetic claws as Biotrog and Koji his trusty assassin's samurai. But when this had no clear winner, Biolante used his Beta Beams, this time firing from both his hands. Koji retaliated by attempting to drop a car on Biolante using his telekinesis. This battle became a no-contest when Koji escaped and Biolante was left frustrated and screaming (KF#98). =The Death of Biotrog= A mysterious man named Yondabis issues a multi-billion man-hunt against Biotrog, contacting several of his enemies like the Kings of the Street, Black King, Koji and the War Claws, Akuma and Biolante (KF#113). The first attack came from the War Claws, shooting an energy weapon at Biotrog while he was on patrol. Narrowly escaping, Biotrog does not see Koji attacking with his sword, drawing first blood. Biotrog fights off Koji, eventually knocking him out. He is then shot by the King of the Street's Beret at almost point blank range, starting another fight. Although injured with a sword and gunshot wound, Biotrog eventually beats Beret (KF#114). Not long after his win, Biotrog is attacked by Akuma. Feeling the effects of the previous battles, Biotrog uses his telekinesis to push Akuma away, not noticing two of Black King's pawns behind him. Held by the pawns, Akuma attacks Biotrog causing his mask to be removed. Escaping the pawns, Biotrog counterattacks breaking Akuma's sword with his claws. Walking away from the battle, Biotrog finally encounters Yondabis who was waiting for him. Biotrog recognizes Yondabis and is surprised to learn that he is the mastermind behind the attack. Biotrog furiously attacks but Yondabis makes short work of our battered hero declaring that he is weak and that Dr. Wang only has one son (KF#115). Biotrog lays bloody and unconscious on the ground. Yondabis tries to make sure that Biotrog is dead but is forced to leave when he hears police sirens nearby. The police capture all the criminals that Biotrog previously defeated but only finds Biotrog's broken emblem on the ground. News of this spread with the media reporting the hero dead. At their base, Dr. Wang confesses to Bernard and Angel that he thinks that his son Yondabis is behind this before being interrupted by loud noises coming from their lab. Upon inspection, Angel discovers Formula 1700 missing. It is later revealed that the thief is no other than Biolante. He brings the formula to his base where he is also keeping Biotrog's missing body. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the city, Yondabis expresses his jealousy over Dr. Wang's favoritism of Biotrog when they were young. Fashioning his own dark version of the suit, Yondabis assumes Biotrog's identity (KF#116). Yondabis as Biotrog later attacks the city. Angel and Bernard as the Red Ninja tries to stop him but Yondabis fights them with ease declaring that they will follow Biotrog in death. He defeats Bernard knocking him down and begins taunting Angel calling her sweetheart. \\"She is not your sweetheart,\\" a voice from behind him say. Yondabis turns and see the new and improved Biotrog standing before him. Biotrog quickly springs into action attacking Yondabis. With Angel, Bernard and Biolante cheering him on, Biotrog defeats Yondabis telling him that he always considered him as a brother. At this time, Dr. Wang appears to talk to his son and clear the issue between them. In the end, Yondabis leaves to pursue his father's wishes for him (KF#117). Blades and Bullets \\"Blades and Bullets\\" logo. Art by Gilbert MonsantoSeveral years after its first publication, Infinity Publishing decided to cut back on Kick Fighter's production cost. Revamping the titles which appeared in the comic and renaming the magazine Kick Fighter II, a reshuffling of characters happened which led to other Kick Fighter cast appearing on Biotrog stories. Most notable of these were the secret agent Jolas Suarez (KF's version of Ken Masters) and the outworlder Voltar (KF's M.Bison). The former became his crime-fighting partner, thus the re-titling to \\"Blades and Bullets\\". The series was written and drawn by Biotrog co-creators Jojo Ende Jr. and Gilbert Monsanto. =Teaming Up= The series starts with the outworlder Voltar, fresh from his battle with longtime rival Balzaur, crashing towards Biotrog's prowling grounds. Seeing the trail created by Voltar's descent, Biotrog quickly moves to investigate. However, on the way to the crash site, Biotrog is jumped from behind by an unknown assailant who quickly disappears after the attack (KFII#118). As a result, Biotrog arrives late on the scene with Voltar already awake from the crash. The two are quickly involved in a melee where Biotrog gains the upper hand due to Voltar wielding less power than usual. However, as he is nearly winning the fight, Biotrog is again attacked by the same assailant as earlier, now revealing himself to be the sociopath Bushido (KF's E.Honda) (KFII#119). Bushido's goal is to recruit Voltar to his cause and Biotrog is in his way. The two fight while Voltar, amazed at the turn of events, decides to hold back and kill whoever is left standing. The battle raged on and Bushido overpowered our bionic hero. But as he was about to deliver the final blows, Bushido is shot on the arm by a newly arrived Jolas Suarez. Realizing that his enemies were increasing and that his own powers are somewhat malfunctioning, Voltar decides to escape taking Bushido with him. Biotrog who was injured from the battle is taken to the hospital by Jolas (KFII#120). When Biotrog wakes up, he is informed that he and Jolas must work together to catch Voltar and Bushido. However, upon hearing this, Jolas who has come to the city on Bushido's trail loudly disagrees prompting a shouting match with Biotrog. In the end, Biotrog leaves the hospital on his own. The two weren't the only ones having some issues. Somewhere in the city, Voltar and Bushido were also having a fight - Bushido going as far as trying to use a mind control device on Voltar. Unfortunately for Bushido, Voltar uses the device on him instead (KFII#121). The villains attack Jolas who is patrolling the city alone and with Bushido's strength and Voltar's electromagnetic powers, the two quickly gain the upper hand. But as Voltar was posturing, Biotrog appears and repays Jolas by saving him this time around (KFII#122). Jolas shoots Bushido with a stun gun which negates the effects of the mind- control device. As a result, Bushido quickly turns his attention and attack Voltar. Voltar realizing that the mind-control device no longer works quickly dispatches Bushido with his powers. Biotrog takes advantage of this situation and attacks Voltar. Voltar tries to fight back but Jolas also attacks declaring that he and Biotrog are now allies forcing the villain to flee in defeat (KFII#123). =Rivalry= Though they agreed to become crime-fighting partners, Biotrog and Jolas can't help but get into arguments and pissing contests regarding each other's methods. On their first mission together, Biotrog leaves Jolas alone to execute his own plan against the drug runners they were going after (KFII#125). However, they would just as easily put their differences aside in more extreme situations like fighting Voltar (KFII#128-129) or separating No-Face from his host (KFII#127). The most notable effect of this rivalry is Roger Summers (the alter-ego of Biotrog) and Dianne Mendoza (the alter-ego of the female ninja Angel) finally tying the knot. One day, Biotrog finds Jolas hanging out with Angel in her civilian identity. Angel tells him that Jolas has invited her to the mall and both leave. Biotrog follows them around and becomes jealous. He confronts Jolas declaring to all that he is the man that Angel will marry. Soon after, the two wed with Biolante even in attendance (KFII#133). Omni Powers Infinity suddenly ceased publication of Kick Fighter II (and their other books) and when they returned with Kick Fighter III, titles and characters from their other books also populated the comics magazine. Blades and Bullets was replaced with \\"Omni Powers\\" which was still written and drawn by collaborators Jojo Ende Jr. and Gilbert Monsanto and starring KF characters Biotrog and Jolas Suarez who are joined by the Galaxian Knight Balzaur (KF's Balrog) and lady adventurer Nerva (KF's Cammy). =Power Link= The series starts almost the same as the previous one: with an object crashing towards Biotrog's turf. Biotrog and Angel see this during their date and assumes it is a comet. Biotrog, who at the end of the previous series was being taught about primal energy by Dr. Wang, tries to intercept and destroy the comet with his new cosmic blast but it does not work. Soon after, Jolas arrives at the scene and the two attempt to destroy the comet by combining the cosmic blast with Jolas' Haduken. This time, the target evades and they discover that the comet is not a comet but a life form (KFIII#2). The creature attacks them but with Biotrog and Jolas' combined efforts, they were able to knock it down. Taking a closer look, Biotrog realizes that the creature looks familiar. However, before he can speak any further, the creature hits both him and Jolas declaring that they are now even. The creature is the Galaxian Knight, Balzaur and he needs their help (KFIII#4) and another - Nerva, who they help fight off thugs (KFIII#5). =Diabolus Crystals and Diabolic Foes= The threat to the planet that Balzaur needs their help to fight are the Diabolus crystals. Diabolus was a planet of pure evil and thus was destroyed by Balzaur's boss The Watcher. It was a mistake as the remnants of the planet scattered across the galaxy. Anyone who comes in contact with these Diabolus crystals gain incredible power and becomes pure evil (KFIII#7). It is also capable of animating machines (KFIII#31) as well as reanimating the dead. Cain Cain was a thief who was shot and killed by the police in front of his twin brother's house. Witnessing his death caused his twin brother Abel to lose his mind, creating a second persona who claims to be Cain (KFIII#8). Soon after, Abel comes into contact with a Diabolus crystal that fell from the sky transforming him into a monstrous creature. Nerva who followed the crystal's path encounters Abel's monstrous form with the Cain persona dominant (KFIII#9). The two battle it out with Nerva gaining the upper hand via the use of her self-duplication powers. Cain tries to trick Nerva by manifesting the Abel persona before resuming his attack. Unfortunately for him, Nerva was ready and blasted him (KFIII#10). Upon losing consciousness, Cain transforms back into Abel (KFIII#11). Brainwash Brainwash was a scientist who was hungry for knowledge. Upon coming into contact with a Diabolus crystal, he becomes hungry for knowledge literally (KFIII#12)! Brainwash has the ability to fire eye beams that causes a target to lose his mind. An ability Biotrog discovered when Brainwash's beam hit a dog who then began purring like a cat (KFIII#13). Although Biotrog defeated Brainwash with his cosmic blast, no body was ever found (KFIII#14). Diabolic No-Face Upon separating him from his then host, Biotrog kept the remnants of No-Face secured in a canister at his base. But when Balzaur unknowingly placed a Diabolus crystal near the canister, No-Face reformed attacking Jolas, Balzaur and Nerva while trying to escape (KFIII#15-16). The three had a hard time fighting No-Face's sonic blasts and improved intelligence. The creature was only stopped upon exposure to the scent of Angel's bottled perfume (KFIII#17). Masaker The man who would become Masaker wasn't transformed instantaneously as the other Diabolus hosts. He just picked up the crystal from the pavement because he thought his wife Delia would like it. However, upon arriving at his house, he discovers his wife Delia having sex with another man. This is when the crystal transforms him into Masaker and he kills his wife and her lover (KFIII#18). Biotrog encounters Masaker while on patrol. At first Masaker mistakes Biotrog for an agent of Diabolus and attacks him when he learns that he is not (KFIII#19). It took the combined efforts of Biotrog, Nerva, Balzaur and Jolas to defeat Masaker. But still, no body was found (KFIII#20). Diabolic Biolante After his latest defeat at the hands of Biotrog, Biolante is struck by a falling Diabolus crystal. Upon his transformation, Biolante declares that \\"Biolante\\" is dead and that he and Biotrog are no longer brothers. Later, he waits and kills a newly risen Diabolus-resurrected Koji (KFIII#28-29). He then forms a counter team of Omni-Bandits consisting of ex-Galaxian Knight and Diabolic host Domo, Nerva's friend and the recently converted Black Jaguar and a mysterious fourth lady member named Poison (KFIII#30). However, Kick Fighter III ceased publication before the two teams ever met. Other Appearances =Digmaan= On his blog, Biotrog co-creator Gilbert Monsanto has a free webcomic called Digmaan that brings together most if not all of the classic Filipino super heroes like Captain Barbell and Darna. The comic also features appearances from popular 90's comics icon Biotrog and Combatron. The series is unofficial and can be considered a work of fan-fiction (at least for characters who he did not co-create). The story is ongoing. =Metropolitan= Rambol, a comic book released by Sacred Mountain Publications owned by Gilbert Monsanto, features a series called Metropolitan. This series showcases Monsanto's creations/co-creations from his stint in the 90's comic publications: GASI, Infinity and Sonic Triangle. The story is ongoing. =Biotrog Reassembled= In 2010, Gilbert Monsanto posted an artwork on his blog hinting at a future reappearance of Biotrog. The artwork contained the text: Biotrog Reassembled. Costumes When Biotrog first appeared, he had a similar attire to Street Fighter's Vega (Balrog in Japanese Versions). He wore the same pants albeit different colors. Vega uses gold and violet while Biotrog's was white and blue. For the upper part of his costume, Biotrog wore a single shoulder pad to protect his then normal arm. His cybernetic arm was also covered with synthetic material, enabling it to blend with his normal skin. His mask had an eagle's claw drawn on its left side. He also wore a similar symbol on the strip of leather he wore instead of Vega's snake tattoo. After Biotrog returned after he was supposedly killed by Yondabis and his allies. Biotrog's attire changed to the one shown at the top of this page. The eagle's claw on his mask has been removed. Instead, the lower half of his mask was changed to black. He however, still had the symbol on the leather strip he wore. The shoulder pad also moved to his other shoulder which connected it to the leather strip. Also this time, both his cybernetic arms are shown. He also changed his pants to something that covered his legs entirely - including his feet. The design also changed. Instead of having equal white and blue colors, the lower part of his legs were entirely covered in white. Aside from these, his pants also had a variantion of the eagle's claw. His hair style also changed as he no longer ties his long mane. Powers and abilities Trained by Dr. Wang since he was a child, Biotrog possesses advanced level martial arts skills. Early in the comics, only one of Biotrog's arm was cybernetic. This arm contains a set of retractable cybernetic claws much like that of the X-Men's Wolverine. However, during an encounter with Biolante, Biotrog was forced to cut his other arm in order to remain alive. Since then, Biotrog had his arm replaced and thus now wields two sets of cybernetic claws. His cybernetic parts also gives him the strength of six men. Aside from these, his bionic legs allows him to run faster than ordinary human beings. It seems that Biotrog has some undeveloped telepathic and telekenetic abilities. There have been some instance in the comics when Biotrog moved some objects using his mind (KF#5) and communicate telepathically with Biolante (KF#12). It isn't clear if these are still true. This may have even been retconned out of existence. Behind The Scenes Jojo Ende Jr. was asked to choose a character from a number of images and he chose Vega whose name was listed as Balrog. He had to coin a same-sounding name, hence, Biotrog. After writing the first script, he was introduced to Kick Fighter would-be editor Edgar Coloma. Meanwhile, Gilbert Monsanto was already ready to quit komiks and was on his way out of GASI when he was stopped by Ariel Pineda (Ispikikay) who told him that a new komik magazine is being launched. They went to Edgar Coloma who handed Mondanto a photocopy of an image of the character he would be handling as well as the script from Jojo Ende Jr.https://www.facebook.com/groups/624851554300628/permalink/1379912782127831 At the time, Monsanto was unaware of the arcade game Street Fighter and based Biotrog on Marvel characters Spider-Man and Iron Fist, as well as a gladiator.https://www.facebook.com/groups/624851554300628/permalink/631639723621811/ See also *List of Filipino superheroes References External links * Gilbert Monsanto's Official Blog * Biotrog at International Hero * Gilbert Monsanto THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE * Philippine Comics - The most comprehensive library of Filipino comics on the internet.

According to their website it is the \\"grand-daddy of the queer zine scene\\".Fanorama Zine & Distro:HistoryThe Queer Zine Archive Project. First published in 1992, Fanorama emerged as part of the queercore movement, largely inspired by the zine J.D.s (edited by G.B. Jones and Bruce LaBruce), and the Toronto scene from which J.D.s came. Initially a punk-edged collage of gay porn and commentary, REB soon added a strong, anti- assimilationist political voice to the mix, turning the zine into an artful version of the weekly \\"Queerbeat\\" column he contributed to Rhode Island's alternative arts newspaper, The NicePaper.Queer Zine Explosion 15 The Fanorama tag line at the time became, \\"For those who want a little smut with their politics, or a little politics with their smut.\\" Fanorama began to generate controversy, particularly as it addressed racism and sexism in the gay mainstream establishment; one detractor in the media called REB a \\"kiddie pornographer-turned-moral watchdog\\". During this period, REB was instrumental in leading protests against a local gay bar over a management-led racist incident - a battle which would take center stage in the gay politics of Rhode Island for the better part of a year. Despite what he began to call his \\"infamy,\\" REB's popularity as a personality grew, and he was invited to emcee a mid-1990s Rhode Island Gay Pride celebration; though accepting the position, he would take its organizers to task in later years for the increasing commercialism of the event. Over the course of its publication, Fanorama ran interviews and photo essays with such queer counter-culture heroes as comic book artist Robert Kirby, punk rockers Pansy Division, filmmaker and zine editor Scott Treleaven, and Tommy Ace of the controversial AIDS humor zine, Diseased Pariah News. It has been dubbed \\"the Grandaddy of Queerzines\\" by Factsheet 5. After publishing an issue in which REB mourned his break-up with future Juha frontman Collin Clay, Fanorama took a turn towards pagan spirituality, influenced greatly by his work with the Radical Faeries. The latest incarnation of Fanorama was essentially as a prisoners' rights magazine influenced initially by the stories prisoners sent to its letters to the editor section.Not Your Routine Zine Scene: Awesome Fest at Rotunda, Fire and CODE Zined-Up John Lloyd, P.A.W. Prints, Volume 2 Issue 4; July 2004. It still retains pornography and spiritual angles. The relationships REB developed with prisoners over time were also the impetus for Fanorama to become a publisher of prisoner-authored works.Prison Activist Resource Center:lgbt prisoners Locked Out Summer Solstice 2006 This has led to its constituency expanding from its queer following to include an anarcho-punk/activist readership, particularly since having caught the attention of Maximum Rocknroll and Punk Planet, and more recently gaining the praises of headbanger favorite, Metal Maniacs. REB told Punk Planet in 2005: \\"After doing my zine for over 12 years, after publishing and distributing countless inmate-produced publications, after corresponding with literally hundreds of prisoners, the only folks who ever made me feel 'unsafe' were folks in the free world.\\" The film division of Fanorama has included REB's documentary Queer Rage (chronicling events leading up to and coming out of a riot at the RI State House) and art films Nocturne In E Flat, Jerk Off '94, Waltz of the Flowers, and 13 Boys. Shot mostly on Super-8 film or video, they have been screened at queer indie film festivals across the United States and Canada. In November 2013, he debuted a new film, Rituels Queer at the 26th NYC MIX Experimental Film Festival. In 2014, Rituels Queer was selected to screen at Queer City Cinema Inc. (based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada) and at the 6th Entzaubert DIY Queer International Film Festival in Berlin. REB also facilitates workshops and is a speaker on the issues of zine making, queer rights, and prisoners' rights.URI to host symposium, daylong workshop on gay & lesbian issues, April 3, 4, & 5 University of Rhode Island (2003).

A series of wooden trestles were built to cross Wicked Creek, later named Stegman Creek. In 1885, after repeated fires and floods, the GR&I; hired James House to cut fieldstones from his farm and build this culvert to stabilize the trestle. Eventually, the GR&I; abandoned the trestle and buried it intact within a wall of dirt above the culvert.\\" The Porter Hollow Embankment and Culvert, also known as th Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Culvert, is a stone bridge and trestle over the Stegman Creek along the White Pine Trail in Algoma Township, Michigan.  History  The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad completed its railway through Algoma Township in 1867. Porter Hollow was an unincorporated community along this route, about 3 miles north of Rockford. At Porter Hollow the railroad built a large wooden trestle over Stegman Creek, then known as Wicked Creek. In 1883 a flood damaged the trestle, and a local farmer, James House, collected field stones to build the current trestle over the creek. The railroad ceased operations in 1985, and in the 1990s the Michigan Department of Natural Resources redeveloped the railroad right-of-way into a paved hiking and bicycling trail known as the White Pine Trail.  Today  That stone bridge withstood the rigors of railroad use for nearly a century, and it is in good condition today. The trestle is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a key bridge along the White Pine Trail. Description The Porter Hollow embankment is a 1400-foot-long earth structure, which contains a stone arch culvert passing over Stegman Creek. The culvert is made of cut fieldstone, and measures nineteen feet in width, seventy-five feet in length, and passes about nineteen feet above the water level in the creek below. The stonework rises six feet above the top of the arch, and continues onto wingwalls at each end. The top of the culvert is blacktopped as part of the trail. An unusual feature of the culvert is that the bed of the creek below the culvert is lined with wooden planks.

It begins at and follows a generally southeastward course. In the days of sailing ships, much commerce from the Gulf of Mexico sailed through here and the Rigolets into Lake Pontchartrain to New Orleans and surrounding communities. Chef Menteur Pass was long guarded by Fort Macomb, now an abandoned ruin on the western side of the Pass. Two bridges span the Pass. The automobile bridge, constructed in 1929, carries U.S. Highway 90; the portion of this road between central New Orleans and the pass was long known as \\"Chef Menteur Road\\" before the route became a U.S. highway. Portions are still known as \\"Chef Menteur Highway.\\" The CSX railroad bridge also spans Chef Menteur Pass a short distance south of the highway bridge. The Lake Catherine neighborhood of New Orleans is to the east side of the pass. The Venetian Isles neighborhood of New Orleans is to the west of the pass. This area was hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Highway 90 bridge was the only bridge open from the day that the hurricane struck on 29 August 2005 and remained open for sometime after the Hurricane to aid residents of Slidell Louisiana access to New Orleans and to aid in access to I-10 East, I-12 West and I-59 North.

It satirizes both popular entertainment and American politics during the second Bush administration, called a \\"cultural satire\\" by Weitz. Reviews were lukewarmAmerican Dreamz (2006): Reviews and the film just about broke even at the box office.American Dreamz (2006) - Box office / business Plot On the morning after his re-election, US President Joseph Staton (Dennis Quaid) decides to read the newspaper for the first time in four years. This starts him down a slippery slope. He begins reading obsessively, reexamining his \\"black-and-white\\" view of the world in a more \\"gray-seeming\\" way, and holing up in his bedroom in his pajamas. Frightened by the President's apparent nervous breakdown, his Chief of Staff (Willem Dafoe) pushes him back into the spotlight, booking him as a guest judge on the television ratings juggernaut (and the President's wife's personal favorite) talent showAmerican Dreamz. America cannot seem to get enough of American Dreamz, hosted by self- aggrandizing, self-loathing Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), ever on the lookout for the next insta-celebrity. His latest crop of hopefuls includes Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a conniving steel magnolia with a devoted, dopey veteran boyfriend William Williams (Chris Klein), and Omer Obeidi (Sam Golzari). Because Omer's mother died in the Middle East in an American attack, he joined a group of jihadists. He was an actor in an instruction film for terrorists, but he was too clumsy, and his interest in show tunes was frowned upon. Therefore, he was sent to the U.S. to await further instructions, but the leaders expected they could not use him. He moved to Southern California to live with his extended family there, including his effeminate cousin Iqbal (Tony Yalda) and Shazzy (Noureen DeWulf). Iqbal hoped to be selected to participate in American Dreamz, but in a misunderstanding, Omer was selected instead. Iqbal becomes angered by this at first but later agrees to help Omer win and makes himself his manager. Omer's terrorist organization now sees an opportunity: Omer is instructed to make it to the finale, and kill the President in a suicide attack. He succeeds in getting to the finale. Security is bypassed by assembling the bomb after the security check, in the toilet, from small parts smuggled in (the smaller pieces of explosive are disguised as chewing gum). Omer agrees, but changes his mind and disposes of the bomb in the trash can. Sally is the other finalist. Earlier in the film, she had dumped William because she believed that her life would've gone nowhere if she still had him for a boyfriend and that he'd only drag her down. This drove William to join the army, only to be wounded in Iraq and sent back to the U.S. For the purpose of the show and at the insistence of her agent, Chet Krogl (Seth Meyers), Sally has to pretend that she still loves William. On the eve of the American Dreamz finale, William proposes to Sally, which she rejects until Chet decides to boost Sally's popularity and chances of winning the show by asking William to do the proposal on air. However, William witnesses Sally having sex with Martin, and is furious. When he throws out the engagement ring, he finds the bomb Omer tossed in the trash can. He then comes out on stage and threatens to detonate it. While the other people evacuate, William starts singing and Martin, who refuses to let go of the camera, films it. As William reaches the end of the song, he detonates the bomb by walking into the camera, killing both himself and Martin. The film then cuts to shots of people dialing up their cell phones to vote in for the winner. It is eventually revealed that William Williams was voted the surprise winner of American Dreamz. The epilogue reveals what each of the characters went on to do after the end of last season. Omer went on to become a successful star of his own Broadway revue, where he is shown performing a scene from the musical Grease. The President makes his wife his new Chief of Staff. And Sally Kendoo becomes the new host of American Dreamz.

Weitz went on to call the film a cultural rather than a political satire.

In 1933 he returned to Vienna as a resident conductor of the Volksoper and a regular conductor at the Wiener Staatsoper. He was appointed professor at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1935, and conducted regularly at the Salzburg Festival between 1935 and 1938. In 1938, the Nazi annexation of Austria (or Anschluss) forced Krips to leave the country. (He was raised a Roman Catholic, but would have been excluded from musical activity because his father was born Jewish.) Krips moved to Belgrade, where he worked for a year with the Belgrade Opera and Philharmonic, until Yugoslavia also became involved in World War II. For the rest of the war, he worked as an \\"industrial clerk\\" in a food factory. On his return to Austria at the end of the war in 1945 Krips was one of the few conductors allowed to perform, since he had not worked under the Nazi r√©gime. He was the first to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival in the postwar period. Working with fellow conductors Clemens Krauss and Karl B√∂hm, Krips helped restore the Vienna State Opera and Vienna Philharmonic to their prewar levels. From 1950 to 1954, Krips was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Afterwards, he led the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra from 1954-1963. Under Krips' leadership, the orchestra expanded in the length of its performance season and in the number of musicians that the orchestra employed. Krips took the orchestra on tours in eastern United States and Canada, including the Maritime Provinces. For his time with the Buffalo Philharmonic, Krips largely eschewed recent compositions and \\"concentrated largely in European classical and romantic literature.\\" Later, during his final seasons, Krips began to program \\"a few contemporary works.\\" During this period, Krips guest conducted other orchestras. For example, in February 1960 Krips guest conducted the Montreal Symphony Orchestra with a performance of works by Mozart and Brahms. Krips appeared as guest conductor with the New York Philharmonic in the Fall of 1964, and the program included works by Brahms, Copland, and Schumann. Leaving the Buffalo Philharmonic in 1963, Krips served as the Music Director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1963 to 1970. During his tenure with the San Francisco Symphony, Krips conducted 210 works with the orchestra. Of these works, 91 works were by twentieth century composers. In San Francisco, Krips conducted several world premieres. Krips premiered the First Symphony of Kirke Mechem in 1965. He premiered William Walton's Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten in 1970. Krips made his Covent Garden debut in 1947 and his Metropolitan Opera in 1966, guest conducting frequently from then on. Krips made his first appearance with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the 1968 Berkshire Festival. In 1970, he became conductor of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. Between 1970 and 1973, he was the principal conductor of the Vienna Symphony. Krips died at 72 in Geneva, Switzerland in 1974. The cause of death was lung cancer. Personal life Krips was twice married. His first wife was Maria \\"Mitzi\\" Wilheim, a singer whom Krips had coached and married in 1947. The two remained together until Wilheim's death on April 8, 1969. Krips married his second wife on October 9, 1969. The formal wedding announcement identifies her as Harrietta Fre√ºn von Prochazka, the daughter of Dr. Ottokar Freiherr von Prochazka and Maria Freifrau von Prochazka n√©e Dressler.Wedding announcement for Josef Krips and Harrietta von Prochazka; accessed in the Eve Corker Collection, Sibley Music Library, Rochester, NY. According to Ewen and the New York Times, Krips' second wife was \\"the former Baroness Marietta von Prohaska.\\" The New York Times noted that von Prohaska was his \\"29‚Äêyear‚Äêold secretary.\\" Other sources list the name of Krips' second wife as \\"Harrietta Krips.\\" In the Reuters obituary notice for Josef Krips, her name is listed as being \\"the Baroness Henriette Prochazka.\\" The Boston Symphony Orchestra Archives has a photograph of Krips and his second wife attending a Tanglewood concert, where she is identified as \\"Baroness Harriet Prochazka.\\" Krips' second wife died on 12 January 2015. Krips' brother, Henry Krips, emigrated to Australia and was the chief conductor of the South Australian Symphony Orchestra (later known as the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra) for 23 years (1949-1972). Both brothers appeared together as conductors at a 1963 concert of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. Recordings Krips's first recording was made for Odeon Records in Vienna on 13 January 1937, conducting the Orchestra of the Wiener Staatsoper in two Rossini numbers from the Bernhard Paumgartner operetta Rossini in Neapel, sung by Richard Tauber. Krips conducted the Vienna premiere of the work ten days earlier. In 1950, Krips and the London Symphony Orchestra made a well-received recording of Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (London LPS 86). In 1955, Krips made a critically acclaimed recording of Mozart's Don Giovanni with the Vienna State Opera featuring Cesare Siepi, Fernando Corena, Walter Berry, Suzanne Danco, Lisa Della Casa and Hilde Gueden. In 1956, Krips conducted the Symphony of the Air in stereo recordings of the five Beethoven piano concertos with Arthur Rubinstein for RCA Victor. With the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra Rubinstein and Krips also recorded Brahms Second Piano Concerto in 1958. During the years 1950-1958, Krips recorded various works by Mozart, Brahms, Dvo≈ô√°k, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Johann Strauss, Richard Strauss, Haydn, and Felix Mendelssohn. These performances included the Vienna Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Israel Philharmonic. In January 1960, Krips recorded Beethoven's nine symphonies for Everest Records. For this set of recordings, Krips conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, and for the Symphony No. 9, the soloists included Donald Bell, baritone, Jennifer Vyvyan, soprano, Rudolf Petrak, tenor, and Shirley Carter (later known as Shirley Verrett), mezzo-soprano. The BBC Chorus, under the chorusmaster Leslie Woodgate also performed. This series of recordings was popular with music critics and the public, and the recordings have been reissued several times in authorized and in bootleg editions. During the 1970s, Krips recorded Mozart's late symphonies for Philips Records, conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra. These have been reissued over the years by Philips and more recently by Decca. Krips did not make any commercial recordings with the San Francisco Symphony, although many of his concerts were broadcast in stereo by San Francisco station KKHI.

Stanton played for Hibernian for most of his career, making nearly 400 league appearances. Late in his career, he had a short and successful spell with Celtic. Stanton also made 16 appearances for Scotland. After retiring as a player, he assisted Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen and managed Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline Athletic and Hibernian. Club career Stanton is the great-great nephew of Michael Whelahan (a founder of Hibernian and its first captain) and the great-nephew of Hibernian centre forward James Hendren. He signed for the club in 1963 and made his professional debut later that year. He established himself in the Hibs first team, playing either in defence or midfield. Stanton captained Hibs when they won the 1972 Scottish League Cup Final. Stanton left Hibs in 1976 when he was transferred to Celtic in a swap deal for Jackie McNamara, Sr. Jock Stein, who had briefly managed Stanton at Hibs in the 1960s, identified Stanton as the man to stop Celtic conceding soft goals. This was an apparent success, as Celtic won the Scottish Cup and the Scottish league championship in 1976‚Äì77. Stanton suffered a bad injury early in the 1977‚Äì78 season, which eventually forced his retirement from playing. Hibs and Celtic played a testimonial match for Stanton on 30 April 1978. International career Stanton was selected three times by the Scotland under-23 team early in his career. He won 16 caps for Scotland between 1966 and 1974, captaining the side three times. He also played for the Scotland under-21 team as an over-age player and represented the Scottish League. Coaching and management Stanton got a start in coaching when Alex Ferguson made him his assistant at Aberdeen, a position he held for one season. He then managed Cowdenbeath, then Dunfermline Athletic. He returned to Hibs in 1982, but his spell in the manager's chair at Easter Road was unsuccessful and he resigned in 1984. Other activities After leaving the club as player and manager, Stanton helps Hibernian with their matchday hospitality. Following complications and surgery after the birth in 2012 of his twin grandsons, Stanton has been devoting his time to support of brain-damaged children.

An Other Nationalities representative and the record try scorer in the history of the Rugby League European Championship, Bevan scored a world record 796 tries, mainly for Warrington. In 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia, he was named on the wing of Australia's Team of the Century (1908-2007). Bevan was the only player chosen in the team who had never represented Australia in a test match. Sydney The son of former Eastern Suburbs' player Rick Bevan, Brian Bevan began his career playing for Easts in 1942. He made 8 appearances for the club, although when the Second World War had begun in 1939 he had decided to join the Royal Australian Navy, which restricted his appearances for the club. Ironically, Bevan, who would go on to break try scoring records in English club football, never scored a try for Easts. Brian was the brother of Owen 'Ozzy' Bevan who played for Sydney club the St George Dragons as well as Warrington, and is the great uncle of Paul Bevan who plays Australian rules football for the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League. Britain He arrived on board HMAS Australia in Britain in 1946, and all he had with him was a letter of recommendation which was written by former Eastern Suburbs Test winger Bill Shankland. Bevan requested a trial with Leeds, which was a suggestion from Shankland, but the club decided against signing him partially due to his frail looking appearance. Shankland also recommended he try Hunslet if Leeds refused to sign him, but once again he was turned down. He then decided to try his luck with the Warrington club. Warrington decided to give him an 'A' team trial in November in which he scored a try. The club were impressed with his first performance and decided to play him in the first team a week later. The club then decided to sign him on a permanent basis on a ¬£300 contract. He then returned home to Australia for several months in order to complete his Navy service, before returning to Warrington. In 1946‚Äì47, his first season, he scored 48 tries for the club - 14 tries more than any other player in the league. Within four years at the club he had surpassed the club's try scoring record of 215 set by Jack Fish over thirteen seasons. On five occasions Brian Bevan was the top try scorer in Britain. His best season for try scoring feats was in 1952‚Äì53 when he amassed a total of 72 tries. Only Albert Rosenfeld has scored more tries in a single season in Britain. Rosenfeld holds the top two most tries in a season with 78 in 1911‚Äì12 and 80 in 1913‚Äì14. He was the 1946‚Äì47 Northern Rugby Football League season's top try-scorer with 48. The 1953‚Äì54 season saw him become the highest try scorer in the game's history when he passed the 446 tries mark set by Alf Ellaby. In his career in Britain, Bevan scored a hat-trick of tries or more in a single game 100 times. Twice he scored seven tries in a game for Warrington, which is still a club record. During his sixteen-year career with Warrington he helped the club win the Challenge Cup twice, three RL Championships, a Lancashire Cup and six Lancashire League titles. He played his last game for Warrington on Easter Monday, 1962. He came out of semi-retirement to play for Blackpool Borough between 1962‚Äì64. Brian Bevan played , i.e. number 2, in Warrington's 19-0 victory over Widnes in the 1949‚Äì50 Challenge Cup Final during the 1949‚Äì50 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 6 May 1950, in front of a crowd of 94,249, and played in the 8-4 victory over Halifax in the 1953‚Äì54 Challenge Cup Final replay during the 1953‚Äì54 season at Odsal, Bradford on Wednesday 5 May 1954, in front of a record crowd of 102,575 or more. He scored a try in Warrington's 8-14 defeat by Wigan in the 1948‚Äì49 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1948‚Äì49 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 13 November 1948, played in Warrington's 5-28 defeat by Wigan in the 1950‚Äì51 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1950‚Äì51 season at Swinton on Saturday 4 November 1950. and scored a try in Warrington's 5-4 victory over St. Helens in the 1959‚Äì60 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1959‚Äì60 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 31 October 1959. He played for the British Empire XIII against New Zealand on Wednesday 23 January 1952 at Stamford Bridge in London. In all he scored 796 tries in his career in Britain in competitive matches, a world record by a rugby player of either code). He scored 740 for Warrington, in 620 appearances (both club records). In 1961 he returned to Australia to play for an Eastern Suburbs seven-a-side competition for Keith Holman's testimonial.2005 Annual Report - Australian Rugby League (p. 51) Bevan played most of his career in Britain, and was never selected to represent Australia in a test match, although he did mesmerise Kangaroo touring sides with his guile and skill for almost two decades. Post-playing Statue of Brian Bevan at the Halliwell Jones Stadium In 1988 Brian Bevan was inducted into the British Rugby League Hall of Fame. The 'wing wizard', as he is commonly referred, died in Southport, England in 1991, aged 67. Thousands turned up for his memorial service a month later which was held on the pitch at Wilderspool which was at the time the home of Warrington. The Brian Bevan Wall at the Halliwell Jones Stadium Bevan was featured on a British stamp in 1995, one of a series of five to commemorate the centenary of Rugby League. In September, 2005 he was also inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame He is the only player to have been so doubly honoured. A statue of him was erected in the middle of a roundabout close to Wilderspool Stadium, then moved to the club's new ground, the Halliwell Jones Stadium, in 2004, which also includes a mural showing Bevan's face made from primrose and blue bricks, the traditional Warrington colours. Bevan was also inducted into the Warrington Wolves Hall of Fame. In February 2008, Bevan was named in a list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the National Rugby League and the Australian Rugby League to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Bevan went on to be named as one of the wingers, along with Ken Irvine, in Australian rugby league's Team of the Century. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. In June 2018, Bevan was named on a shortlist of ten players for potential induction into the NRL's The Immortals, with two to be selected and announced in August of the same year. While the NRL made a surprise announcement that they were making five inductions rather than the planned two on the night, Bevan was not among those raised to Immortal status.

Network diagram showing interlocks of the board members of American International Group (AIG), from 2004 with other U.S. corporations. Network diagram showing interlocks between various U.S. corporations and institutions and the Council on Foreign Relations, in 2004 Interlocking directorate refers to the practice of members of a corporate board of directors serving on the boards of multiple corporations. A person that sits on multiple boards is known as a multiple director.Scott, 1997: p. 7 Two firms have a direct interlock if a director or executive of one firm is also a director of the other, and an indirect interlock if a director of each sits on the board of a third firm.Salinger, 2005: p. 438 This practice, although widespread and lawful, raises questions about the quality and independence of board decisions. Socio-political importance According to some observers, interlocks allow for cohesion, coordinated action, and unified political- economic power of corporate executives. They allow corporations to increase their influence by exerting power as a group, and to work together towards common goals.Salinger, 2005: p. 437 They help corporate executives maintain an advantage, and gain more power over workers and consumers, by reducing intra- class competition and increasing cooperation. In the words of Scott R. Bowman, interlocks \\"facilitate a community of interest among the elite of the corporate world that supplants the competitive and socially divisive ethos of an earlier stage of capitalism with an ethic of cooperation and a sense of shared values and goals.\\"Bowman, 1996: p. 21 Interlocks act as communication channels, enabling information to be shared between boards via multiple directors who have access to inside information for multiple companies. The system of interlocks forms what Michael Useem calls a \\"transcorporate network, overarching all sectors of business\\".Useem, 1986: p. 53 Interlocks have benefits over trusts, cartels, and other monopolistic/oligopolistic forms of organization, due to their greater fluidity, and lower visibility (making them less open to public scrutiny). They also benefit the involved companies, due to reduced competition, increased information availability for directors, and increased prestige. Some theorists believe that because multiple directors often have interests in firms in different industries, they are more likely to think in terms of general corporate class interests, rather than simply the narrow interests of individual corporations. Also, these individuals tend to come from wealthy backgrounds, socialize with the upper classes, and tend to have worked their way up the corporate hierarchy, making it more likely that they have internalized values that will cause them to personally support policies that are beneficial to business in general. Furthermore, multiple directors tend to be more frequently appointed to government positions, and sit on more non-profit/foundation boards than other directors. Thus, these individuals (known as the \\"inner circle\\" of the corporate class) tend to contribute disproportionately to the policy-planning and government groups that represent the interests of the corporate class,Domhoff, 2006: pp. 30-31 and are the ones that are most likely to deal with general policy issues and handle political problems for the business class as a whole. These individuals and the people around them are often considered to be the \\"ruling class\\" in modern politics. However, they do not wield absolute power, and they are not monolithic, often differing on which policies will best serve the interests of the upper classes. Interlocks not only occur between corporations, but also between corporations and non-profit institutions such as foundations, think tanks, policy-planning groups, and universities.Bowman, 1996: p. 22 They can also be seen as a subset of connections in a larger upper class social network which includes all of the aforementioned types of institutions as well as elite social clubs, schools, resorts, and gatherings.Domhoff, 2006: Chapter 3 Multiple directors are \\"roughly twice as likely as single directors to be in the Social Register, to have attended a prestigious private school, or to belong to an elite social club.\\" Modern interlock networks Analyses of corporate interlocks have found a high degree of interconnectedness amongst large corporations.Domhoff, 2006: p. 26 It has also been shown that inbound interlocks (i.e. a network link from external firms into a focal firm) have a much greater impact and importance than outbound interlocks, a finding that laid the foundation for further research on inter-organizational networks based on overlapping memberships and other linkages such as joint ventures and patent backward and forward citations.Johannes M Pennings, 1980. Interlocking Directorates: San Francisco: Jossey Bass Virtually all large U.S. corporations are linked together in a network of interlocks. Most corporations are within 3 or 4 \\"steps\\" from each other within this network. Approximately 15‚Äì20% of all directors sit on two or more boards. The largest corporations tend to have the most interlocks, and also tend to have interlocks with each other, placing them at the center of the network.Domhoff, 2006: p. 27 Major banks, in particular, tend to be at the center of the network and have large numbers of interlocks. With the globalization of financial capital following World War II, multinational interlocks have become progressively more common.Scott, 1997: pp. 18-19 As the Cold War escalated, well-connected members of the CIA harnessed these interconnections to launder money through front foundations, as well as more substantial institutions such as the Ford Foundation. A relatively small number of individuals‚Äîa few dozen‚Äîbind this multinational network together by participating in transnational interlocks and sitting on the boards of multiple global policy groups (such as the Council on Foreign Relations). Legality In the United States, the Clayton Act prohibits interlocking directorates by U.S. companies competing in the same industry, if those corporations would violate antitrust laws if combined into a single corporation. However, at least 1 in 8 of the interlocks in the United States are between corporations that are supposedly competitors. 1970 graphs In 1979 Levin and Roy reportedJoel H. Levin & William H. Roy (1979) \\"A study of interlocking directorates\\", pp 349‚Äì78 in Perspectives on Social Network Research, editors: Paul W. Holland & Samuel Leinhardt, Academic Press on interlocking directors at 797 corporations in 1970 where the board of directors ranged from 3 to 47 members, with a mean size of 13. Only 18% of the 8623 directors were on more than one board, though the mean number of interlockers for a corporation was 8. The components of the graph were 62 isolated boards, four pairs of corporations interlocked by one or more directors, a triad of interlocked corporations, and the greater component of 724 corporations. For an arbitrary pair of corporations in this component the median path length was 3. Levin and Roy tested the graph for cut points and failed to find any with their search starting with corporations with large boards. In a study of clustering in the graph, Levin and Roy demonstrated the use of a bipartite graph with corporations listed on one side and directors with multiple seats on the other. The clusters become evident in a physical model using elastic bands and paper clips. The directors and corporations are listed arbitrarily to begin and the elastic bands placed as edges of the bipartite graph. Then a perusal of the elastics may suggest a re-ordering on one side or the other with the elastics slightly less tense. After some iteration this procedure reveals a cluster structure in the bipartite graph.

In full, it reads, Interpretation Writing in 1982, when the Charter came into force, constitutional scholar Peter Hogg noted that these words, being a preamble, could not really be applied by the courts but in theory could help to determine how other sections of the Charter should be read and applied. In this particular case, however, Hogg expressed doubt as to how much help this preamble could be, noting the term \\"rule of law\\" is \\"notoriously vague\\" and that the mention of the \\"supremacy of God\\" is contrary to section 2 of the Charter, which protects freedom of conscience, which Hogg felt would include a right to atheism.Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated. Toronto, Canada: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982. In R v Morgentaler (1988), Justice Bertha Wilson defined freedom of conscience as protecting \\"conscientious beliefs which are not religiously motivated\\", and balanced the preamble out with the statement that \\"the values entrenched in the Charter are those which characterize a free and democratic society\\". In considering the legal implications of the preamble in the 1999 case R v Sharpe, the British Columbia Court of Appeal referred to it as a \\"dead letter\\" which the B.C. justices had \\"no authority to breathe life\\" into.Farrow, Douglas. \\"Of Secularity and Civil Religion.\\" In Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy. Ed. Douglas Farrow. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004. The Supreme Court did consider the preamble's mention of the rule of law in Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights (1985), noting that striking down most of Manitoba's laws as unconstitutional (because they were not enacted in both languages as required by the Manitoba Act) might be a threat to the rule of law. This would render Manitoba nearly lawless, and the principle of the rule of law was defined as meaning no one is above the law and that laws must exist, as they uphold society's values. The Court therefore confirmed the Charter's preamble's importance by stating, \\"The constitutional status of the rule of law is beyond question.\\"Reference re Manitoba Language Rights pages 747-750. Consequently, some time was given before the unconstitutional laws would expire. In Re BC Motor Vehicle Act (1985), the Supreme Court also linked the rule of law to the principles of fundamental justice, as illustrated by sections 8 to 14 of the Charter. The Court noted the importance of these rights to the justice system, stating that sections 8 to 14 \\"have been recognized as essential elements of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in 'the dignity and worth of the human person' (preamble to the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III) and on \\"the rule of law\\" (preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms).\\"Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486 at para. 30. =Alternate interpretations= Theologian Douglas Farrow has written that while some courts have rejected that the preamble's mention of God can have any force, the preamble indicates that, \\"Canada cannot be regarded as a strictly secular country, in the popular sense of the term.\\" Farrow writes that either Canada \\"is, or is not, committed to the notion that divine worship is linked- one way or another- to 'a love of the laws,' and a love of the laws to divine worship\\". The word \\"Whereas\\", moreover, indicates all sections of the Charter should be read in light of the principle recognizing the supremacy of God. This includes the \\"rule of law\\", which comes after the \\"supremacy of God\\" in the preamble, and Farrow writes that the rule of law \\"is hard to account for, to interpret, or to sustain without reference\\" to the supremacy of God, as the rule of law developed from the religious backgrounds of Canada.Farrow Farrow also questioned whether the preamble refers to a specific God (the Christian God or Jewish God) or to a more abstract concept that promotes civic virtue (i.e., civil religion). This intractable problem is summarized by University of British Columbia Professor Paul Russell (philosopher) as follows: ‚ÄúThe basic problem with the God-clause is that it runs into an impossible dilemma, given the actual content of the Charter itself. More specifically, what it claims is either meaningless (and therefore worthless), or it has real meaning, in which case it strikes a blow against the very principles that the Charter is in place to protect (in which case it is pernicious)‚ÄùPaul, Russell. \\"The supremacy of God does not belong in the Constitution\\", The Globe & Mail, June 11, 1999. In R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd, a dissenting judge on the Alberta Court of Appeal, Justice Belzil, wrote that the preamble to the Charter indicated Canada had a Christian heritage and thus courts should not use the section 2 right to freedom of religion to eliminate traditions of this heritage. History New Democrat Svend Robinson has opposed the preamble's mention of God. After one version of the Charter drawn in June 1980 that lasted until September, which said in its preamble that Canadians \\"shall always be, with the help of God, a free and self- governing people\\",Egerton, George. \\"Trudeau, God, and the Canadian Constitution: Religion, Human Rights, and Government Authority in the Making of the 1982 Constitution.\\" In Rethinking Church, State, and Modernity: Canada between Europe and America. Eds. Daniel Lyon and Marguerite Van Die. University of Toronto Press. the Charter was not going to have a preamble. The current preamble only first appeared in the April 1981 draft, which came relatively late in the process. It was included despite the fact there was no call for the Charter to have a preamble by the Special Joint Committee which was reviewing the Constitution,Hogg. and that according to George Egerton, the prime minister of Canada at the time, Pierre Trudeau, called it \\"strange\\" that some of his colleagues wanted God referenced in the Charter. (Trudeau told his MPs, \\"I don't think God gives a damn whether he's in the constitution or not.\\") However, there were various religious and Conservative criticisms of the Charter during its drafting, with fears that denominational schools and Canada's abortion law were threatened. Also at this time, religious groups in Canada such as \\"100 Huntley Street\\" and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada were growing and wanted God acknowledged in the Constitution. Despite the Liberal Party of Canada's protests that a better preamble could be written after patriation was achieved and that therefore there was no need for the preamble being proposed at the time by the Conservatives, religious groups increased their activism. Trudeau's justice minister, Jean Chr√©tien, said it was the top issue in all of the letters the government was sent during patriation.Egerton. Farrow identified the Charter preamble as being the successor to, although shorter than, the preamble in the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights,Farrow. which reads: There was also precedent for religious references in Canadian politics in the national motto (\\"A Mari usque ad Mare\\"), which is derived from Psalm 72. The reference to the supremacy of God was new to the Canadian Constitution itself, however. The British North America Acts made no mention of this, even though as author George Egerton remarked, \\"It is doubtful if the Canadian political elites of 1982 were as firm as the patriarchs of 1867 in their devotion to the supremacy of God\\"; indeed, many were aiming for more separation of church and state. The preamble has been politically controversial. In 1999, New Democratic Party MP Svend Robinson proposed before the House of Commons of Canada that the mention of God be struck from the preamble, citing concerns about Canada's diversity and those Canadians who would not share that principle. He was supported by a thousand constituents who had signed a petition, but the proposal was controversial and the party leader moved Robinson to the backbenches. Societal impact The preamble has proved valuable to some groups and political parties. The Christian Heritage Party of Canada, for example, quoted the preamble on the main page of their website, and the party called itself \\"Canada's only pro- Life, pro-family federal political party, and the only federal party that endorses the principles of the Preamble to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms\\". The words \\"principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law\\" also appear in the party's official policies regarding what they feel all laws should be based upon, and the party states, \\"'Human rights' as expressed in the ;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms can only, therefore, be legitimately interpreted in light of, or in conjunction with, the higher Moral Law of God.\\" See also * Preamble to the United Nations Charter * Preamble to the United States Constitution * Constitution of Fiji: Preamble References Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ","title":"Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms"},{"id":"3662868","text":"The Christian Democratic Women's league is the women's wing of the Christian Democratic Party in Sweden.

New cable-stayed bridge is in foreground left. The 1939 truss bridge is behind it and right. The Kosciuszko Bridge This describes two possible pronunciations, but there are many other pronunciations in practice. See: * * is a cable-stayed bridge over Newtown Creek in New York City, connecting Greenpoint in Brooklyn to Maspeth in Queens. The bridge consists of a pair of cable-stayed bridge spans: the eastbound span opened in April 2017, while the westbound span opened in August 2019. An older bridge, a truss bridge of the same name that was located on the site of the westbound cable-stayed span, was originally opened in 1939 and was closed and demolished in 2017. The crossing is part of the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway (BQE), which carries Interstate 278. The older truss bridge replaced a swing bridge called the Meeker Avenue Bridge, which connected Meeker Avenue in Brooklyn to Laurel Hill Boulevard in Queens. The old Kosciuszko Bridge, originally also called the Meeker Avenue Bridge, carried six lanes of traffic, three in each direction. In 1940, a year after opening, the bridge was renamed after Polish military leader Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, who fought alongside the Americans in the American Revolutionary War. In 2014, a contract was awarded and work begun to build one of two replacement bridges with more capacity, with the first bridge initially carrying bidirectional traffic. The replacement bridges have the same name as the original bridge, and are both cable-stayed bridges that will each carry one direction of traffic. The first bridge, located south of the old truss bridge, opened on April 27, 2017, with three lanes in each direction. Once the old bridge was demolished via controlled explosion in October 2017, a new westbound cable- stayed bridge with four lanes and a bike/pedestrian path started construction on the site of the old bridge. The first cable-stayed bridge became eastbound- only with five lanes when the westbound bridge opened on August 29, 2019. __TOC__ Original bridges The first bridge on the site was built in 1803 through an Act of Legislature authorizing the \\"building of a Toll Bridge over Newtown Creek: this bridge charged one cent per foot passenger, which was why the bridge was called the \\"Penny Bridge.\\" The original bridge was replaced several times. Also called Meeker Avenue Bridge, the structure in use since 1894 was still informally known by some as the Penny Bridge. The bridge structures connected Meeker Avenue in Brooklyn to Review Avenue and Laurel Hill Boulevard in Queens. Until 1888, the bridge was operated by private companies and thereafter became the property of the people. In 1896, the bridge became the property of the city of Brooklyn and in 1898, upon consolidation, it was taken over by the Department of Bridges of the Greater City of New York. The Kosciuszko Bridge, originally referred to as the Meeker Avenue Bridge, opened on August 23, 1939.Anonymous. \\"Meeker Avenue Bridge Opened.\\" Queens Borough. August 1939. It was built at a cost of $6million to $13million (equal to between $ and $ in dollars). The Meeker Avenue Bridge's design and form were vastly different than the first Meeker Avenue Bridge. The earlier was a swing drawbridge and carried a two-lane, roadway and two sidewalks. The new bridge carried two three-lane concrete roadways each wide and separated by a median, as well as walkways alongside it. Additionally, this new bridge structure contained of steel, along with of concrete masonry. One person who helped build the new $1.5million Meeker Avenue Bridge was John Kelly, a former Navy deep-sea diver from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, who became famous for helping to work on the new bridge. In 1938, he completed his task of building a cofferdam, a box-like structure made of 250 steel sheets. This enabled workmen to operate and build an underwater pier in dry surroundings on the Brooklyn side of the new bridge; after that, Kelly began cutting away cofferdam bracings on the Queens side, at Laurel Hill Boulevard and Review Avenue. One of the tools he worked with was an underwater-operated cutting torch, which burned oxygen, hydrogen, and compressed air.Anonymous. \\"His Mistake In Joining Navy Instead Of The Army Makes Former Flushing Man Famous As Diver.\\" Long Island Daily Press. October 11, 1938. The city government officially renamed the bridge after Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, a Polish volunteer who was a General in the American Revolutionary War, on July 10, 1940. On September 22, 1940, months after the conquest of Poland, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia led a ceremony in which he formally renamed the new Meeker Avenue Bridge over Newtown Creek after Ko≈õciuszko. The naming occurred in the presence of 15,000 people, mainly Polish-American residents and city and state government representatives, some stating that the spirit of Polish liberty would never die. There were parades at both ends of the bridge, and La Guardia also unveiled plaques that commemorated the new name. In making an ovation, the mayor described President Franklin D. Roosevelt, like Ko≈õciuszko, as a \\"champion of liberty during a difficult period\\", referring to World War II in which Poland was occupied by Germany. He also stated, \\"I am confident that Poland will live again. Any land that breeds such lovers of freedom can never be kept enslaved. The Polish people may be captive, but the flaming spirit of Polish liberty will never be destroyed.\\" Two of the bridge towers were surmounted with eagles, one with the Polish eagle and the other the American eagle. A repaving project in 1958 temporarily made the bridge a one-way operation for five months. Only Queens-bound traffic was allowed during afternoons and evenings, while only Brooklyn-bound traffic was permitted at all other times. In 1965, the Kosciuszko Bridge was widened, and the approach ramps on the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway and Long Island Expressway were rebuilt into an incomplete partial cloverleaf interchange for $32.7million. The BQE was rebuilt from Cherry Street, at the Brooklyn end of the bridge, to Queens Boulevard in Queens. A small section of the LIE was reconstructed near its interchange with the BQE, between Van Dam Street and Maurice Avenue. This necessitated temporary detour routes around the bridge. At this time the original bridge's walkways were removed to add more car lanes. Replacement The 1939 bridge, which was only meant to serve 10,000 vehicles per day, carried 18 times that amount of traffic when it became part of the Interstate Highway System. It was not up to Interstate standards since it did not have any drainage pipes or shoulders. By the 1990s, the bridge was deteriorating and heavily congested. After an 18-month study in 1994‚Äì5, State Transportation Department officials concluded that in order to relieve congestion on the busy span, a new $100million bridge, which included an additional three lanes, should be built next to the original six-lane Kosciuszko Bridge. This new bridge would be part of a renovation project planned for the entire crossing. DOT Supervisor Peter King stated that this new bridge may be required to avoid severe traffic backups on neighborhood streets surrounding the bridge during renovation of the Kosciuszko. King felt that in order to resolve the increasing number of severely congested streets and intersections, \\"a second parallel span\\" may be the answer. =Construction of eastbound bridge= In 2009, it was decided to replace the 1939 structure with a new bridge, which was to consist of a five-lane eastbound span, a four-lane westbound span, a bike path, and a walkway. Four designs were considered for the new structure: a cable-stayed bridge, a through arch bridge, a box girder bridge, and a deck arch bridge. The cable-stayed bridge design, selected after a public review process, makes the replacement bridge the first vehicular cable-stayed bridge in New York City since the Brooklyn Bridge (which has a hybrid suspension/cable-stayed design), as well as the first major new bridge in New York City since the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge's completion in 1964. Construction was originally expected to begin in 2013, but was then delayed to winter 2014. About 140 trees were removed on both sides of the bridge in April 2014 in preparation for the rebuilding, though officials say twice the number of trees will be replanted once the bridge's reconstruction was completed. On May 23, 2014, a $554.77million design-build contract, for the construction of the eastbound span and demolition of the old bridge was awarded to a team consisting of Skanska, which will be managing partner; Ecco III of Yonkers; Kiewit Corporation of Nebraska; and HNTB of Kansas as the lead design firm. It is the largest single contract ever awarded by the New York State Department of Transportation. The work involved building a new eastbound viaduct, which was completed in 2017; the existing eastbound structure would then be demolished. The westbound viaduct would then be completed by 2020. The new bridges are being built since the Kosciuszko Bridge is known as a notorious traffic bottleneck; according to The New York Times, it is \\"perhaps the city's most notorious [bridge], hated and feared by drivers and synonymous in traffic reports with bottlenecks, stop-and-go and general delay.\\" The bridges would reduce delays by up to 65% during rush hours, as well as provide a new pedestrian/bicycle connection between the boroughs. On December 4, 2014, work began on the eastbound bridge, which entailed temporarily narrowing the Meeker Avenue entrance on the Brooklyn side on the bridge in order to widen it in the long run. Work was to take place in the daytime, temporarily causing more traffic congestion. By August 2015, the two pylons for the eastbound bridge, as well as part of the bridge structure, were under construction. The pylons were sunk , with each pylon resting on four foundations at that depth. After the pylons were completed, a supporting steel-and-concrete deck section called a pier table was built between the two pylons. The other deck sections were then built outward from the pier table, with two cables supporting each section, creating a deck supported by 56 cables in total. A counterweight was built under the western section of the eastbound bridge since the eastern section was longer and heavier. The new bridge was built to withstand a century's worth of traffic. The new eastbound bridge, which initially hosted both directions of traffic, opened ahead of schedule on April 27, 2017, with a ceremony attended by Governor Andrew Cuomo. The bridge is the first of several bridges citywide to feature an advanced lighting system ‚Äì part of Governor Cuomo's \\"New York Harbor of Lights\\" initiative ‚Äì which would allow the bridge to display light shows as a tourist attraction. At that time, five of six lanes of traffic were shifted to the new bridge, with a single lane of westbound traffic temporarily using the old bridge until the end of the month. The new bridge kept the same name as the original. = Demolition and construction of westbound bridge = Collapsed approach at Queens (east) end Part of the original structure was set to be demolished by controlled explosion in summer 2017 so that work on the new westbound bridge could begin soon after. This type of demolition, beginning with Governor Cuomo personally pushing the button to detonate the bridge, saved seven to nine months compared to if the entire bridge had been carefully dismantled. The new westbound span and pedestrian/bike lanes would be ready in 2020, providing the bridge with extra traffic capacity. Initial reports speculated that the explosion date would be July 11. Instead, the main span of the bridge was lowered onto a barge, and the approaches would then be exploded. This updated plan was meant to be environmentally friendly since less of the bridge would be scattered into the creek below. At the time there was no date set for the actual demolition. The old bridge's main span was lowered onto two barges tied together, and on July 26, 2017, the main span was shipped to New Jersey to be recycled. This marked the completion of the first phase of the old bridge's demolition. The approaches to the former main span were demolished on October 1, 2017, with the detonation of 944 small explosive charges. This was the largest explosive demolition in New York City and the first of a bridge there. The state would recycle the twenty trusses from the approaches, which weigh a combined . Westbound span, opened September 2019; the walkway and bikeway is to the left Afterward, construction started on the westbound bridge. Work progressed quickly, and in May 2019, Cuomo announced that the westbound bridge would open by that September. The opening date of the westbound bridge was later revised to August 29, 2019. The westbound bridge opened as scheduled on that date, though pedestrians and bicyclists were allowed to cross the day before. As part of the construction of the westbound span, it was announced that a park would be built in the unused space beneath the Brooklyn approach, and would open in 2020. The park, to be named \\"Under the K\\", would contain four segments: a pathway called the Arm, a multi-use zone called K-flex 1, a performance space called K-flex 2, and a waterfront seating area called Creekside. =Controversies= The nameplate of the Kosciuszko Bridge In 2008, it was discovered that two Native American tribes indigenous to Queens, the Matinecocks and the Canarsies, were not informed of the bridge replacement project under federal law. The Delaware Nation, in Oklahoma, and the Stockbridge-Munsee, in Wisconsin, both originally native to New York City, were given a month to comment on the bridge project, in addition to the Matinecocks and the Canarsies. Following the opening of the westbound bridge, bicyclists' advocacy groups pointed out that there was not enough bike infrastructure connecting to either end of the bridge, especially since both ends were in primarily industrial neighborhoods. The city planned to install short, on-street bike lanes leading to both ends of the bridge. In response, comptroller Scott Stringer said that there needed to be \\"protected bike lanes\\", completely segregated from traffic, on both sides of the bridge. A lawsuit was filed in February 2020 by armor-manufacturing company Hardwire against its former vice president, Irvin Ebaugh IV, who was the new bridge's manager of bridge safety. In the lawsuit, it was alleged that the Kosciuszko Bridge was susceptible to terrorist attacks and was a danger to public safety. Specifically, the allegations held that the bridge was dangerous due to improperly manufactured armored cables, and because plans for the cables' composition had been posted online. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a criminal investigation into the details of this case.

He is not included in the Forbes list of the world's richest people as his personal wealth cannot be assessed with much accuracy from publicly available information. Al-Rashid completed his B.S. at the University of Texas in 1965, and his PhD at the university in 1970. He has since remained a prominent donor to the University of Texas, and has been honoured by the university at its Distinguished Alumnus Awards ceremony. The Dr Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid Strength and Training Center at the university is named in his honour. He is also a large donor to the University of Miami (FL) and its medical school. He owns one of the largest yachts in the world, the Lady Moura, which reportedly cost over US$200M to build in the late 1980s. In March 1987 Al-Rashid was one of the guests at a state banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth II for King Fahd at Buckingham Palace. His previous wife, Mouna Ayoub, a Lebanese woman, is considered to be a French socialite. Ayoub subsequently wrote a memoir of their marriage, La v√©rit√© (The Truth), in which Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid is referred to as \\"Amir al-Tharik\\". In the memoir Ayoub likened her marriage to a \\"...a gilded cage where I felt myself to be unjustly treated and powerless...I was given the most sumptuous dresses and amassed a huge collection of jewels, yet I could only wear my black Arab robe and a veil.

He enjoyed a prolific rugby league career with English club St. Helens after switching codes from rugby union in the 1950s. Van Vollenhoven became a rugby league sensation with the club in a career spanning ten seasons from the 1957 to the 1967‚Äì68 season. During this time he amassed a club record 392 tries in 408 appearances. This includes a record 62-tries scored during the 1958‚Äì59 season. In 2000, he was inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame.RL Record Keepers' Club Early life Van Vollenhoven was born 29 April 1935 in Bethlehem, Free State, South Africa. He played rugby union for Northern Transvaal, and scored a hat-trick for the Springboks against the British Lions, and then toured Australasia the following year with the national team before going to Britain to play professionally in 1957. Tom van Vollenhoven had been scouted by the 13-a-side code in 1955 in a 'cloak and dagger' style operation which saw English club St. Helens vie off the competition of Wigan for his services, and the attention of the South African RFU. Move to Britain Van Vollenhoven was brought into a St. Helens team to add a scoring threat out wide, in a side that at the time, was more noted for its forward prowess. His rugby league d√©but was against Leeds at Knowsley Road, and his first experience of the code was a negative one as he was responsible for a blunder which gifted the Yorkshire side a try. However such disappointment was short lived as Van Vollenhoven produced a harbinger with a well taken try later in the same match much to the excitement of the Knowsley Road faithful. His centre, Duggie Greenall was given strict orders to nurse and protect Van Vollenhoven whilst he found his way in his new game. Greenall was noted as something of a hardman, notably involved in a scandal with the Australians who claimed Greenall's ruthless tackling had more to do with him using a plaster cast as to his tackling itself. Regardless, Greenall proved to be a fine centre for Van Vollenhoven in his early days, ensuring that the wingman received little risky ball and that adequate defensive cover was provided when necessary. Van Vollenhoven equalled St. Helens' club record for most tries in a match with 6 against Wakefield Trinity in 1957. The crew cut wingman would prove over the years what an extraordinary talent he was, with arguably his finest moment coming in the 1958‚Äì59 Championship Final at Odsal, where his hat trick of tries helped St. Helens overcome Hunslet. His first try is noted in rugby league folklore as one of the greatest tries in the history of the game. Van Vollenhoven beat a series of defenders in a blistering run down the touchline culminating in a try under the sticks. Regrettably, there is no video footage of this achievement as the cameras were not filming for this short period of the game. Many contend that until Van Vollenhoven's intervention, there was every chance that the Yorkshiremen could have overturned the favourites. Tom van Vollenhoven played and scored a length-of- the-field try in St. Helens' 12‚Äì6 victory over Wigan in the 1961 Challenge Cup Final during the 1960‚Äì61 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 13 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 94,672, and played in the 21‚Äì2 victory over Wigan in the 1966 Challenge Cup Final during the 1965‚Äì66 season at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 21 May 1966, in front of a crowd of 98,536. Tom van Vollenhoven played in St. Helens' 2‚Äì12 defeat by Oldham in the 1958 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1958‚Äì59 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 25 October 1958, played in the 4‚Äì5 defeat by Warrington in the 1959 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1959‚Äì60 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 31 October 1959, played , and scored a try in the 15‚Äì9 victory over Swinton in the 1960 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1960‚Äì61 season at Central Park on Saturday 29 October 1960, played , and scored a try in the 25‚Äì9 victory over Swinton in the 1961 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1961‚Äì62 season at Central Park on Saturday 11 November 1961, played , and scored a try in the 7‚Äì4 victory over Swinton in the 1962 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1962‚Äì63 season at Central Park on Saturday 27 October 1962, played right- and scored a try in the 15‚Äì4 victory over Leigh in the 1963 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1963‚Äì64 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 26 October 1963, played in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Warrington in the 1967 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1967‚Äì68 season at Central Park on Saturday 7 October 1967, and played in the 13‚Äì10 victory over Warrington in the replay Station Road on Saturday 2 December 1967. Tom van Vollenhoven played in St. Helens' 0‚Äì4 defeat by Castleford in the 1965 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1965‚Äì66 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Tuesday 14 December 1965. Over the years Van Vollenhoven matured into a fine all round athlete, honing the other areas of the game that a modern-day winger is required to fulfil. This is supported by the fact that Van Vollenhoven had occasionally appeared at centre and even played one game at full-back. He established himself as a strong defensive wingman, capable of rushing over to the other flank to pull off try-saving cover tackles, whilst he was a stronger player than looks would suggest. The 1960s were a golden era for wingers in the British league, and debate continues to this day over who can lay claim to be the premier winger of the generation. Commentators are split over whether Van Vollenhoven's searing speed, or the sheer power of Billy Boston marked them as the finest winger of their era. Tom van Vollenhoven's final St. Helens match was against Hull Kingston Rovers in April 1968 and his final game of rugby league was guesting for Great Britain in a trial match for the 1968 World Cup, at Thrum Hall, Halifax. Many former players would testify that rugby league was a brutal and vicious game in the 1950s and 1960s. The game was not as sanitised as it is in the Super League era and matches could be attritional affairs. Inevitably, injury took its toll by the mid 1960s. With Van Vollenhoven etching out a reputation as a prolific scorer, opponents would employ unscrupulous tactics to counter his threat, such as the vicious stiff-arm unleashed by Huddersfield's Peter Ramsden, at Knowsley Road in 1963, which saw Van Vollenhoven lying prostrate on the turf, unable to continue. In his final season in 1967‚Äì68, Van Vollenhoven was a shadow of himself although he was regarded as a good player and underlined this by tallying three tries in his last appearance against Wigan at Knowsley Road. Death Van Vollenhoven died in his native South Africa on 21 October 2017 aged 82.

The French army, commanded by Jean Baptiste Kleber and Jean Reynier laid siege to the fortress of El Arish for nine days. The fortress finally fell to the French on 20 February 1799. Background Napoleon had recently subdued a revolt against the French occupation in Egypt, and with his borders secure, continued his offensive against the Ottoman Empire. In the beginning of 1799, a force of 2,160 soldiers under the command of Jean Reynier marched towards the Ottoman fortress of El Arish. The fortress contained a total of 15,500 soldiers under the command of Mustafa Pasha. Initial Skirmish On 8 February 1799, Reynier's troops reached Masoodiah, where French soldiers captured a Mamluk runner who told them that El Arish was under Ottoman control. Reynier sent a courier to Bonaparte calling for immediate reinforcements and took position on a sand hill near El Arish. In response, Ottoman forces moved into a nearby palm forest and obtained supplies and twelve cannons. Their cavalry began skirmishing with French forces. After half an hour of Ottoman artillery fire, Reynier sent French troops to take the village of El Arish. The Ottoman defenders of the village fled and escaped into their fort, and their cavalry withdrew on the road to Gaza under the cover of a defile. All twelve cannons were captured by the French. French lost 3 killed while the Ottomans 450 killed and wounded and 900 captured.Micheal Clodfelter Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and other numbers. p.106 Siege On 12 February 1799, Kleber's division reached El Arish, and his forces began a siege of the Ottoman fort. Reynier's division moved into position in the palm forest near the defile. On 14 February 1799, Reynier's forces attacked an Ottoman camp, which they successfully captured, suffering 23 casualties. The Ottomans, on the other hand, suffered about 500 killed, along with 900 Ottoman prisoners of war captured by the French. 1,000 soldiers under Ottoman commander Ibrahim Nizam were still inside the fort, however, and after processing captured material, Reynier established a camp from which he also began sieging the fort. Meanwhile, the main body of French forces under Napoleon arrived in El Arish. On 17 February 1799, French commander Louis Caffarelli started engineering work. The French then began artillery fire on the Ottoman fortifications. On 20 February 1799, the French began their assault, and successfully captured El Arish from the Ottomans. After capturing the fort, the French repaired the fortifications that had sustained damage during the siege. Aftermath The French had lost 200 killed and 300 wounded. The Ottomans had lost 900 soldiers, with a further 800 being captured. Around 300 of those switched sides and joined the French army when given the opportunity to do so, and the remaining prisoners were moved to cities in Egypt under French command. 40 soldiers who managed to escape settled in Great Britain with the help of British military members sympathetic to their cause.

A regular break for rest or to eat meals does not count as a \\"split\\". For example, a person may work from 05:00 to 09:00, take a break until 14:00 and then return to work until 19:00. This kind of pattern is especially common for people such as public transport employees (where it is advantageous to have additional staff working during traditional rush hour times) or bar staff that work at lunchtimes and during the evening.  Workers  About 3% of Americans work a split shift. This work schedule is followed by about 9% of workers in the transportation, utilities, and agriculture industries. Split shifts are most common among low-income workers. They are also common among people who primarily work in the evening. Workers on this schedule are more likely to be subject to mandatory overtime. People working split shifts are just as likely to be men or women, and equally likely to be parents of small children. Married Americans are somewhat more likely to work a split or rotating schedule than single people.  Effects  Split shifts can tie employees to work for extended periods, and the time in between shifts can be lost traveling to and from work. People working split shifts report somewhat more work‚Äìfamily conflict, such as not being able to spend as much time with their children, than people on a regular work schedule, and slightly more than people on a rotating work schedule. Work stress is not increased by working a split shift. However, there are also benefits for some workers. For example, California law requires employers to pay the equivalent of one extra hour's pay to most employees who are working split shifts. Some workers may prefer regularly scheduled split shifts to provide a break for other activities, such as caring for children after the end of the school day and before the other parent gets off work.

Christophers was born and raised in Germany with an English father and a German mother. At 16 he moved to England to attend the sixth form at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, where he represented England at under-16 and under-18 level. He studied Geography at Loughborough University, for whom he played in a BUSA final. In 2000, he took a year out of his studies playing for Brive and represented England under-21s. On graduation, in 2001, he signed full-time with Bristol Shoguns. During the 2002/03 season Christophers was a regular for Bristol Shoguns and a bit-part player for England. However, when Bristol Shoguns were relegated at end of that season, he signed for Leeds Tykes. Christophers scored a try on his England debut against Argentina. In his third and final appearance for England, he came on as a replacement in the 2003 Six Nations Championship match against Wales. However just after coming on he was sin-binned. England went on to win the Grand Slam. During the 2003/04 season at Leeds, he was named both the Players Player of the Year and Supporters Player of the Year. He toured New Zealand and Australia with England, but did not play. At the end of the 2004-05 season Leeds won the Powergen Cup where he was a starter.

On the 3 of March, 1799, the French laid siege to the city of Jaffa, which was under Ottoman control. It was fought from 3 to 7 March 1799. On the 7 March, French forces managed to capture the city. Background Having successfully subdued all of Egypt, Napoleon Bonaparte was continuing his push on the Ottoman territories in the Middle East. Having recently captured an Ottoman fortress at El Arish, he was looking to cement his foothold in the Levant. In early March, his troops reached Jaffa. Siege The city of Jaffa was surrounded by high walls, and extensive fortifications had been constructed by the Ottomans. Ahmed al-Jazzar entrusted its defence to his troops, including 1,200 artillerymen. Napoleon had to win Jaffa before he could advance any further, and the whole expedition's success depended on its capture‚Äîthe city was one of Greater Syria's main mercantile centres, and had a harbour which would provide vital shelter for his fleet. All the exterior works could be besieged and a breach was feasible; when Bonaparte sent an officer and a trumpeter to Ahmed al-Jazzar to order the surrender of the city, he decapitated the messengers and ordered a sortie. The sortie was pushed back as early as the evening of the same day; the French managed to destroy one of the towers on the city fortifications, and despite resistance by its defenders, Jaffa was taken. According to some sources, the French messengers who had brusquely told the city of Napoleon's ultimatum ended up being arrested, tortured, castrated and decapitated, and their heads impaled on the city walls. This harsh treatment led Napoleon, when the city fell, to allow his soldiers two days and two nights of slaughter and rape. He also executed the Ottoman governor Abdallah Bey. Bonaparte no longer wished to honour the promises of his step son Eug√®ne de Beauharnais that prisoners' lives would be spared and ordered that a large part of the Ottoman prisoners (according to some sources around 2,440, according to other sources 4,100), most of them Albanians, be executed by being shot or stabbed to death with bayonets.\\"Memoirs of Napoleon\\", completed by Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, p.172 Napoleon's eulogists later wrote of this decision: \\"For, to keep in submission so considerable a number of prisoners, it would have been necessary to detach guards for them, which would have severely diminished his army's numbers; and if he had allowed them to leave free men, it was reasonable to fear that they might swell the ranks of Ahmed al-Jazzar's troops.\\" Aftermath The monument to Napoleon's soldiers at Stella Maris Monastery. Napoleon also allowed hundreds of local citizens to leave the city, hoping that the news they would carry of Jaffa's fall would intimidate the defenders of the other cities in Syria. This backfired, since their news instead made these defenders fight all the more fiercely. Meanwhile, a plague epidemic caused by poor hygiene in the French headquarters in Ramla decimated the local population and the French army alike.Jaffa: A City in Evolution Ruth Kark, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 1990, pp. 8‚Äì9. As he had also suggested during the siege of Acre, on the eve of the retreat from Syria-Palestine Napoleon suggested to his army doctors (led by Desgenettes), that the seriously ill troops who could not be evacuated should be given a fatal dose of laudanum, but they forced him to give up the idea. Overcome in the north of the country by the Ottomans, Napoleon abandoned Palestine. After his departure the British, allied to the Ottomans and commanded by William Sidney Smith, rebuilt Jaffa's city walls. In the years 1800 to 1814, after a new nine-month siege, Jaffa was again taken over by Napoleon's former opponent, Ahmed al-Jazzar, Acre's governor.

Plot Mike (Terry Serio) is a young man who is a budding street racer, and owner of a Ford Falcon GT-HO Phase III. His best mate and mechanic, Tony (Vangelis Mourikis), are both steel workers by day, but when they aren't working, they are racing. Fox (Richard Moir) is the top street racer of the area, and owner of a Dodge Challenger; no one dares cross him and his tight group of mates, and he is currently unbeaten, but when Fox wins a race against an unnamed racer in a Holden Monaro, who then, following the race loses control of his car in anger and ends up perishing in a fiery crash, no one has the stomach to race.....Fox is now facing a drought of racing and therefore money. Julie is the voyeuristic young girl portrayed by singer Deborah Conway, and seemingly involved with Fox. Mike fancies her, and the feeling is mutual. Fox takes advantage of this weakness, and pursues Mike, and basically tells him that if he wants whats his (Julie) he has to race for it. Mike loses the first race to Fox, the fact being his Falcon just isn't fast enough. They decide to go out to the country (filmed in Cobar, New South Wales), to race easy wins to make enough money to build up the engine (351 Cleveland) of his Falcon to beat Fox. Between playing \\"Spotto\\" (a form of eye spy) on the way and scamming service station attendants, we only see them racing one group of people, a bunch of dim-witted bogans called the Gazard boys, in an EK Holden, who they knew they would beat and go on to do so. They agree on a double or nothing race for the next day. The next morning they find themselves at Rebel's garage, who they crossed paths with the day before, and they realise that Rebel (Max Cullen) is blind, but still has a great passion for life and cars. He still drives his prized blown '57 Chevy coupe, with the help of his wife Joan (Annie Semler). Mike then sets out to find the racers from yesterday, with them leading Mike, Tony and Julie into a trap, where the racers threaten to burn the Falcon to the ground with them in it unless they give them back their money that they lost the day before. They proceed to get angrier wetting the car with gasoline and then setting it on fire, with Mike trying to drive away and in the process roll the car a few times, but managed to start it up again and drive the car into a shallow lake to quench the fire. They arrive back at Rebel's, the car barely moving, and Rebel allows them to stay just as long as it takes to get the car fixed. Over the course of a few weeks, Rebel, Mike and Tony repair the car back to its former glory and after a few days of testing the car and tuning it with nitrous they return to the city to race Fox once again. As the cars line up at the start line (The brick-yards in Homebush, Sydney) As they set of and reach redline speed in what seems like a setup from Mike's point of view but was really just an accident, a truck pulls out in front of Fox and Mike during the race, destroying the Falcon and injuring Mike. After Mike's recovery in hospital, it seems he has given up‚Äîuntil Tony is bashed by Fox's head thug for riding a bicycle after Fox told them \\"no wheels and off the street\\". Mike confronts Fox and challenges him to a race. Mike plans to race and bet Rebel's Chevy, he knows it will beat the Dodge - he just has to convince Rebel to let him use it. Mike heads back to Rebel's and asks him for the car. After Rebel's reluctant agreement, teaching Mike to drive it and handle the car properly, they head back to the city once more, only to have Fox, realising that he has no chance against the Chevy over the quarter mile, decides they will run Kemps Creek instead, which is a mile long race, figuring that he has the speed advantage. After the eventful race through Kemps Creek and Mike's eventual victory, there is a dramatic sort of stand-off between the two, and Fox, possibly coming to terms that he lost, drives the Dodge full speed into a wall, killing himself and destroying the car, as if to make the point that Mike would never have his car. The movie ends with Mike's not so fussed reaction to this event and fades into the credits.

A legend recounts that Yamato Takeru, who injured his leg during his crusade to the East, visited the shrine in accordance with the directions of an old man who appeared in a dream.

Beeby or simply Beeb, was a New Zealand educationalist and psychologist. He was influential in the development of the education system in New Zealand, first as a director of the New Zealand Council for Educational Research (NZCER) from 1936, and then as Director of Education (head of the Ministry of Education) from 1940, initially under the First Labour Government. He also served as ambassador to France and on the UNESCO executive. Beeby's wife Beatrice was one of the founders of the New Zealand Playcentre movement, and his son was the distinguished New Zealand diplomat and international lawyer, Chris Beeby, portrayed in Ben Affleck's film, Argo. Early life and education Beeby was born in Meanwood, Leeds, Yorkshire, and immigrated with his family to New Zealand in 1906. He was educated at New Brighton School and Christchurch Boys' High School, and initially studied law at Canterbury College, before switching to Christchurch Training College to study primary teaching. Beeby met Beatrice Newnham while they were both undergraduate students and they were married in 1926. Beeby gained an MA in 1926, and had been working as a part-time lecturer during the latter part of his studies. He worked for a PhD at Victoria University of Manchester, under the tutelage of Charles Spearman. Spearman's belief in a strong hereditary component to intelligence was to influence Beeby's later educational beliefs. Beeby was not fond of his given names, and elected from an early age to be known by his surname. Career On returning from England, Beeby worked as a lecturer and then acting professor at Canterbury College, before taking up the position of director of NZCER. During this time, he developed a belief that all students had a right to continuing education, not just the most academically gifted. During this period, Beeby was noticed by Peter Fraser, the Minister of Education, and in 1939 was appointed Assistant Director of Education. Beeby became Director of Education just prior to Fraser's ascension to Prime Minister. After leaving the Ministry of Education, he served as Ambassador to France from 1960 to 1963, and also was assistant director-general for UNESCO. Following the end of this term, he held positions at Harvard University and the Institute of Education University of London. In 1968 he returned to New Zealand, and continued to play an active role as researcher and consultant in both New Zealand and overseas. Honours and awards Beeby was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953. In the 1956 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, and in 1964 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Gregory the Great. On 6 February 1987, Beeby was the second appointee to the Order of New Zealand, New Zealand's highest civilian honour.\\"The Order of New Zealand\\" (12 February 1987) 20 New Zealand Gazette 705 at 709.

The lake lies around 20 km (12.4 mi) west of Mj√∂lby, bordering in the west to Omberg. The whole lake, with the surrounding beaches, has been a nature reserve since 1975. From April to the end of July, it is not open to the public, except for visiting areas and walking routes. The lake's history as a birdlake is related to the lake's water level lowering between 1842‚Äì1844. A number of bird species benefitted from this. A change of the water level in the 1960s was made to prevent large differences in the water level. T√•kern is in Ramsar Convention, an international convention for protection of valuable wetlands.

Life in Europe He was born Karl Theodor Christian Friedrich Follen (also Follenius) at Romrod, in Hesse-Darmstadt (present-day Germany), to Christoph Follenius (1759‚Äì1833) and Rosine Follenius (1766‚Äì1799). His father was a counselor-at- law and judge in Giessen, in Hesse-Darmstadt. His mother had retired to Romrod to avoid the French revolutionary troops that had occupied Gie√üen. He was the brother of August Ludwig Follen and Paul Follen, and the uncle of the biologist Carl Vogt. He was educated at the preparatory school at Giessen, where he distinguished himself for proficiency in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, and Italian. At the age of seventeen, he entered the University of Giessen to study theology. In 1814 he and his brother August Ludwig went to fight in the Napoleonic Wars as Hessian volunteers; however, a few weeks after enlisting, his military career was cut short by an acute attack of typhus fever, which seemed for a time to have completely destroyed his memory. After his recovery he returned to the university and began studying law, and in 1818 was awarded a doctorate in civil and ecclesiastical law. He then established himself as Privatdocent of civil law at Giessen, while simultaneously studying the practice of law in his father's court. As a student, Follen joined the Giessen Burschenschaft, whose members were pledged to republican ideals. Though he did not attend himself, Follen was a major organizer of the first Wartburg festival of 1817.This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Early in the fall of 1818, he undertook the cause of several hundred communities in Upper Hesse in opposition to a government measure directed at the last remnant of their political independence, and drew up a petition to the grand duke on their behalf. It was printed and widely circulated, and aroused public indignation to such a pitch that the obnoxious measure was repealed. However, the opposition of the influential men whose plans were thereby thwarted precluded any thought of a career in Follen's home town. He became a Privatdozent at the University of Jena in October 1818. At Jena, he wrote political essays, poems, and patriotic songs. His essays and speeches advocated violence and tyrannicide in defense of freedom; this, and his friendship with Karl Ludwig Sand brought him under suspicion as an accomplice in Sand's 1819 assassination of the conservative diplomat and dramatist August von Kotzebue. Follen destroyed letters linking him with Sand. He was arrested, but finally acquitted due to lack of evidence. His dismissal from the university and continuing lack of opportunity prompted him to move to Paris. There he met Charles Comte, the son-in-law of Jean Baptiste Say and founder of the Censeur, a publication which he defended until he chose exile in Switzerland over imprisonment in France. He also became acquainted with Marquis de Lafayette, who was then planning his trip to the United States. Follen came under suspicion again after the political assassination of Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry in 1820, and fled from France to Switzerland. In Switzerland, he taught Latin and history for a while at the cantonal school of the Grisons at Coire. His lectures, with their Unitarian tendencies, offended some of the Calvinistic ministers in the district, so Follen requested and obtained a dismissal, with a testimonial to his ability, learning, and worth. He then became a lecturer on law and metaphysics at the University of Basel. At Basel, he made the acquaintance of the theologian Wilhelm de Wette and his stepson Karl Beck. Both Follen and Charles Comte were forced to leave Switzerland.Charles Dunoyer And French Classical Liberalism In Follen's case, demands were made by the German government for his surrender as a revolutionist. These were twice refused, but after a third (more threatening) demand, Basel yielded, passing a resolution for Follen's arrest. In 1824 Follen and Beck left Switzerland for the United States of America via Le Havre, France. Life in the United States Follen Community Church Arriving at New York City in 1824, Follen anglicized his name to \\"Charles.\\" Lafayette was then visiting the United States and sought to interest some people of influence in the two refugees, who had moved from New York City and settled in Philadelphia. Among those Lafayette contacted were Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, a prominent lawyer, and George Ticknor, a Harvard professor. Ticknor in turn interested George Bancroft. With the help of these sympathetic people, the refugees established themselves in Massachusetts society. Beck quickly secured a position at Bancroft's Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts, in February 1825. Follen continued to study the English language and law in Philadelphia, and in November 1825 took up an offer from Harvard University to be an instructor in German. In 1828 he became an instructor of ethics and ecclesiastical history at Harvard Divinity School, having in the meantime been admitted as a candidate for the ministry. In 1830 he was appointed professor of German literature at Harvard. He became friendly with the New England Transcendentalists, and helped introduce them to German Romantic thought. In 1828, he married Eliza Lee Cabot, the daughter of one Boston's most prominent families. Follen also gave demonstrations of the new discipline of gymnastics, made popular by \\"Father Jahn\\". In 1826, at the request of a group in Boston, he established and equipped the first gymnasium there and became its superintendent. Follen resigned this position in 1827, and the responsibilities were taken over by Francis Lieber. With the assistance of Beck, Follen established the first college gymnasium in the United States at Harvard in 1826. The Follens had a house built on the corner of Follen Street in Cambridge. Their family Christmas tree attracted the attention of the English writer Harriet Martineau during her long visit to the United States, and the Follens have been claimed by some as the first to introduce the German custom of decorated Christmas tree to the United States. (Although the claim is one of several competing claims for the introduction of the custom to the United States, they, together with Martineau, were certainly early and prominent popularizers of the custom.) His brother Paul Follen emigrated in 1834 to the United States, settling in Missouri. In 1835, Charles Follen lost his professorship at Harvard due to his outspoken abolitionist beliefs and his conflict with University President Josiah Quincy's strict disciplinary measures for undergraduates. A close friend and associate of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, Follen's outspoken opposition to slavery had incurred the hostility and scorn of the public press. Like most of the early radical abolitionists, Follen at the beginning was censured by public opinion even in the locality which later became the centre of the abolition spirit. The good beginning that had been made in the study of the German language in New England was totally discontinued. The cause of German literature had still a friend in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who in 1838 began his lectures on Johann von Goethe's Faust.Faust (1909), v. 2, pp. 216-217. Follen's friendship with the prominent Unitarian minister William Ellery Channing drew him to the Unitarian Church. He was ordained as a minister in 1836. He had been called to the pulpit of the Second Congregational Society in Lexington, Massachusetts (now Follen Church Society-Unitarian Universalist) in 1835, but the community was unable to pay him sufficiently to support his family. Follen took other employment; Ralph Waldo Emerson supplied the pulpit from 1836-1838 at the church. In 1838 Follen became the minister of his own congregation in New York City, now All Souls, but lost the position within the year due to conflicts over his radical anti-slavery views. He considered returning to Germany, but returned in 1839 to the congregation in East Lexington, Massachusetts. He had designed its unique octagonal building, for which ground was broken on July 4, 1839. Follen's octagonal building is still standing, and is the oldest church structure in Lexington. In his prayer at the groundbreaking for the building, Follen declared the mission of his church: Memorial to Charles Follen in the churchyard > [May] this church never be desecrated by intolerance, or bigotry, or party > spirit; more especially its doors might never be closed against any one, who > would plead in it the cause of oppressed humanity; within its walls all > unjust and cruel distinctions might cease, and [there] all men might meet as > brethren. Follen broke off a lecture tour in New York and took the Steamship Lexington to Boston for the dedication of his new church. Follen died en route when his steamer caught fire and sank in a storm in the Long Island Sound. Due to Follen's abolitionist positions, his friends were unable to find any church in Boston willing to hold a memorial service on his behalf. Rev. Samuel J. May was finally able to hold a memorial service for Charles Follen in March 1840 at the Marlborough Chapel. Works * Psychology (1836) * Essay on Religion and the Church (1836) In 1841, Follen's widow Eliza, a well-known author in her own right, published a five-volume collection containing his sermons and lectures, his unfinished sketch of a work on psychology and a biography she wrote.

Headquartered in Westford, Massachusetts, NETSCOUT serves enterprises community, government agencies and telecommunications service providers. In July 2015, NETSCOUT acquired the communications business of Danaher Corporation, including Arbor Networks, Fluke Networks, Tektronix Communications and VSS Monitoring. NETSCOUT has subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands , a tax haven. Network General NETSCOUT Systems acquired Network General in 2007. Network General developed the original network packet sniffer in 1986; it merged with McAfee Associates in 1997 to form Network Associates. In mid-2004, Network Associates sold off the Sniffer Technologies business to Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group for $275 million in cash to form Network General. In early 2006, Network General acquired Fidelia Technology, adding the NetVigil Business Service Monitoring technology to their network and application performance analysis tools. In September 2007, Network General agreed to be acquired by NetScout Systems for $205 million. NETSCOUT Systems Netscout Systems was founded by Anil Singhal and Narendra Popat as Frontier Software in 1984. NetScout created the first RMON based Ethernet Probe in 1992. In November 2007, NETSCOUT acquired their Sniffer, Infinistream, and Network Intelligence product lines of Network General. NETSCOUT merged both product lines to allow their Performance Manager product to use both probes and Infinistream technologies. In April 2011 NETSCOUT acquired voice and video management company, Psytechnics, from Ipswich U.K. It then acquired Fox Replay, a privately held Dutch company in 2011, and later that year, after many years of partnering and complementing solutions for network switch port aggregation, NETSCOUT moved directly into competition with its partners by acquiring privately held Simena Networks. In October 2014, NETSCOUT Systems announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Communications business of science and technology company Danaher Corporation for about $2.6 billion. Upon completion of the merger, Danaher's shareholders would own nearly 59.5 percent of the combined company, and NETSCOUT shareholders would own the remaining stake. Analyst firm 451 Research, a technology-industry syndicated research and data firm, predicted in May 2015 that with the acquisition, NETSCOUT will be the largest company in the network visibility management space, with \\"more than 3,000 employees and well over $1bn a year in revenue\\". In July 2015, NETSCOUT finalized its acquisition of the communications business of Danaher Corporation, including Arbor Networks (security systems), Fluke Networks (RF and Wi-Fi network troubleshooting and analytics), Tektronix Communications (traffic inspection, customer experience management and analytics) and VSS Monitoring (network packet brokers).

The last major redrafting came in 1991, but this version was further changed by the Sahrawi National Council ‚Äî the SADR's parliament in exile ‚Äî in 1995 and 1999. The constitution provides for a separation of powers between judicial, legislative, and executive branches. It names Arabic as the national language and Islam as the state religion, and grants every citizen freedom of speech and the right to property. It further determines that an independent Western Sahara will be a multiparty democracy with a market economy. Presently, however, the constitution ties the SADR to the Polisario Front, which is working to establish an independent Western Sahara. For example, the Secretary General of the Polisario Front (now Mohamed Abdelaziz) is constitutionally identical to the President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, until the achievement of independence. This is because the constitution differentiates between before and after the Western Sahara is independent. Thus, several clauses will not come into effect until the proclamation of independence, and various changes in the political order will then occur (see e.g. articles 9, 10, 30, 31, 45). Among other things, the constitution details a transitional phase after independence has been declared (see articles 130‚Äì133, Chapter Three ) in which the POLISARIO is detached from the republic and transformed into a political party among others. As such, the SADR remains a dominant- party system. For information on the institutions and elections that are regulated in the constitution of the SADR, see here and here. For information on the political institutions of the Polisario Front, see here. Preamble The following is an English translation of the 1999 version preamble of the Constitution of the SADR.

The route runs from US 64 in Conway to US 63/412 in Black Rock through Greers Ferry, Batesville, and the foothills of The Ozarks. Route description left AR 25 begins in Conway at US 64. Near Conway, it is strictly a local route with no direct access to Interstate 40. A I-40 exit west of AR 25 is marked as AR 25 North, but the road serving it is officially called US 64 Spur; its junction with US 64 is 0.7 mile west of AR 25. From Conway, the road runs north to Wooster, where it turns northeast, meeting US 65 in Greenbrier. The route overlaps US 65 for several miles north of Greenbrier, then continues northeast, meeting AR 107 and AR 225 before entering Quitman. AR 25 continues diagonally northeast, meeting AR 16 and Little Rock Road near Heber Springs. A business loop and two spur routes both serve Heber Springs. AR 25 continues north with AR 5, a partnership named Heber Springs Road, until AR 5 departs at Wolf Bayou. AR 87 joins AR 25 in nearby Concord. Entering Independence County, AR 25 meets AR 14 in Locust Grove. The route meets US 167 just north of the Batesville Municipal Airport in south Batesville. In central Batesville, AR 25 (here concurrent with US 167) meets AR 69 before exiting town headed due east. AR 122 meets AR 25 near Cord, after which it begins heading north. AR 25 runs north until AR 230 in Strawberry, followed by a meeting and concurrency with AR 361 from Lynn to Black Rock. In Black Rock, AR 25 ends at US 63 and US 412. Except where it coincides with U.S. 65 at Greenbrier and U.S. Highway 167 at Batesville (both undivided four-lane segments), and certain passing lanes, (mostly between Greenbrier and Heber Springs), it is entirely a two-lane highway. This hilly, curvy road is useful for those seeking the towns and recreational areas along it, mainly in the Greers Ferry Lake area. History The segment between Conway and Wooster is a former route of U.S. 65. Before 1982 it included an east‚Äìwest highway between U.S. Highway 63 approximately southeast of Portia, Arkansas and the Missouri state line, where it continued into Missouri. In 1982 this road was redesignated as the anomalous U.S. Highway 412. Major towns along the road include Walnut Ridge and Paragould. This section through the cotton country of eastern Arkansas was flat and largely straight, except where it passed through Crowley's Ridge west of Paragould. Its eastern terminus was then the Missouri state line at the St. Francis River, where it continued as Missouri Route 25 toward Kennett, Missouri. Some sources continue to claim that Highway 25 ends at US 67/AR 34 at Walnut Ridge. Though this was the original west end of U.S. 412 when established in 1982 from Highway 25 east of Walnut Ridge, it was later extended west across Arkansas along the former Black Rock-Walnut Ridge segment of Highway 25 (including its concurrency with U.S. 63 from Black Rock to Portia), thus truncating Highway 25 at Black Rock where it meets the present U.S. 63-412 concurrency.

It was built of stone, a rare and rarely used material in Florida. The shrine included the church, and an elaborate set of statuary which made up the stations of the cross, and which were spread through the surrounding woods on a set of trails. A statue of St. Anne stood in the lake itself on a raised stone platform, creating a very evocative scene. Pilgrimages were made to the shrine from throughout the state, and thousands of people crowded the narrow road from the highway to the small lake, often parking a great distance away and walking to the shrine. This shrine, which was complete with tableaux and scenes of the Holy Land in murals, sculpture and paintings, would also host the Feast of Saint Anne on July 26 and thousands would attend this event and Mardi Gras was also hosted here. The shrine was de-sanctified by the Diocese of St. Augustine in the 1960s, and most of the shrine was removed to prevent vandalism. Some historical traces remain. The story of St. Anne's Shrine goes like this: A man from Canada, (believed to be Napoleon Pelletier) came down to Florida with his very sick son. His son had been diagnosed as terminally ill. In search of warmer climate, French Canadians had traveled here to escape severe winters and the first pilgrimage was in 1928. While traveling in Florida, they came upon the little lake at what is now St. Anne's. They swam and camped there and the boy's condition improved, and he was miraculously cured. His cure was attributed to the healing waters, and so the man single- handedly built a shrine to St. Anne, a popular Canadian saint associated with water, in an oak hammock next to the lake. During World War II, the once flock of French Canadians could no longer visit this shrine as a result of the war closing it and another concern was commercialism, all of this combined eventually declined the church. Plans of reopening the church were considered but, again, commercialism was a concern and the plans never fully formed. The Catholic Church eventually demolished most of the church in 1950, leaving only the altar. Several stone walls, and the original steps of the church remain. Although the shrine now closed, the Catholic Diocese of Orlando still owned the land and when, in 1981, a priest attempted to sell the land to build a home, locals protested and the land was preserved. Saint Anne is more common in France and this is the only place in Florida with Saint Anne relics. The shrine nowadays is still very common on postcards and, in 2002, the Lakeland Ledger said of the shrine: \\"Historically speaking, it might be one of the most unique religious sites in Central Florida\\".

This defeat led to a large part of the Austrian army being invested in the fortress of Ulm by the army of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte of France while other formations fled to the east. Soon afterward, the Austrians trapped in Ulm surrendered and the French mopped up most of the remaining Austrians forces, bringing the Ulm Campaign to a close. In late September and early October 1805, Napoleon carried out a gigantic envelopment of the Austrian army in Bavaria led by Karl Mack von Lieberich. While the Austrian army lay near Ulm, south of the Danube River, the French army marched west on the north side of the river. Then Napoleon's troops crossed the river east of Ulm, cutting the Austrian retreat route to Vienna. Finally waking up to his danger, Mack tried to break out on the north side of the river, but a lone French division blocked his first attempt. Realizing that his enemies might escape the trap, Napoleon ordered Ney to cross to the north bank of the river. Ney's larger corps attacked Riesch's corps at Elchingen on the north bank. The French captured the heights and drove the Austrian soldiers west toward Ulm, forcing many of them to surrender. While a body of Austrians remained at large on the north bank, the near destruction of Riesch's command meant that the bulk of Mack's army was hopelessly surrounded in Ulm. Background On 8 September, the army of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este crossed the Inn River and invaded the Electorate of Bavaria. Mack planned to establish 88 battalions and 148 squadrons on the Lech River near Augsburg by the end of October. Though called upon to join Austria against France, Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Bavaria instead withdrew his army north to the Main River in accordance with his secret alliance with France. Karl Mack von Leiberich changed the strategic plan By 12 September when the Austrians occupied Munich, Mack changed his mind and discarded his earlier plan. He decided to concentrate his army farther west on the Iller River so he could counterattack any French invasion coming through the Black Forest. As part of his new strategy, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franjo Jelaƒçiƒá (also Franz Jellacic) was ordered to move from Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke John's Army of the Tyrol to Lake Constance. Mack expected to have 50,000 to 55,000 troops in position near Ulm by the end of September. Jellaƒçiƒá would hold the left flank with 11,000 soldiers while Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer 12,000-man corps watched the Bavarians from Ingolstadt. However, the change of plans threw the Austrian army's supply system into disarray. As the weather turned bad, sickness and desertion began to diminish the army's numbers. The nominal army commander, Archduke Ferdinand and Mack's chief of staff General-Major Anton Mayer von Heldensfeld both insisted that the army halt at the Lech as originally planned. By the end of September, relations between Mack and Ferdinand became so poor that all communication between the two was done in writing.Rothenberg, 89 Battle of Gunzburg strategic map, situation morning 9 October 1805 Ferdinand and Mayer appealed to Emperor Francis II. The emperor sought the advice of Feldmarschall Archduke Charles, who commanded the Army of Italy, and was warned that Mack was making a strategic blunder. Even so, the emperor backed Mack to the hilt and relieved Mayer of his post. Mack's army began to assemble on the Iller. On 24 and 25 September, Napoleon launched the Grande Arm√©e across the Rhine River to open the Ulm Campaign. While Marshal Joachim Murat's Cavalry Corps and Marshal Jean Lannes's V Corps advanced directly east toward Ulm, the bulk of Napoleon's army passed to the north of the Austrian army.Chandler Campaigns, 390 Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's I Corps, General of Division Auguste Marmont's II Corps, Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps, Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps, and Marshal Ney's VI Corps wheeled east, then southeast, then south. On 5 October, Kienmayer reported that the French were in Ansbach, to the north of the Danube. Two days later, the French crossed the Danube on a broad front, moving south.Rothenberg, 90‚Äì91 At this time Mack's army was divided into four corps. Jellaƒçiƒá had 15,000 troops in 16 infantry battalions, six J√§ger companies, and six cavalry squadrons to the south of Ulm. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg commanded 28 battalions and 30 squadrons at Ulm. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz von Werneck had 30 battalions and 24 squadrons near G√ºnzburg. Kienmayer's command near Ingolstadt consisted of 19 battalions and 34 squadrons. Unwisely, Mack decided to defend Ulm, instead of trying to escape the approaching French army.Kagan, Frederick W. The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801‚Äì1805. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2006. . 392‚Äì393 Mack reacted by sending Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Xavier Auffenberg with only 6,000 men to stop the French. Murat and Lannes crushed the hapless Auffenberg at the Battle of Wertingen, inflicting losses of 400 killed and wounded on the Austrians and capturing 2,900 soldiers and six cannons. The next day, General of Division Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's VI corps division attacked General-Major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr√©'s 7,000 troops in the Battle of G√ºnzburg. The Austrians suffered 2,000 casualties while the French lost 700 soldiers.Smith, 203 Pierre Dupont Napoleon placed Davout and Bernadotte at Munich to guard against General Mikhail Kutuzov's Russian army and Kienmayer's troops. The emperor sent Soult west to Memmingen, south of Ulm. Murat, Lannes, Ney, Marmont, and the Imperial Guard moved directly west toward Ulm.Horne, 109‚Äì110 & 113 maps At this time, Ney's corps was still on the north bank. On 11 October, when Murat ordered Ney to bring his corps to the south bank, Ney furiously protested but was overruled.Horne, 111 In consequence, Mack and Prince Schwarzenberg with 25,000 troops fell upon General of Division Pierre Dupont's solitary division in the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen that day. Dupont's 5,350 infantry, supported by General of Division Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly's 2,169 cavalry fought the Austrians to a standstill. Dupont's force was mauled, losing 2,400 casualties, plus 11 guns and 2 eagles captured. Austrian losses numbered 4,100 killed, wounded, and captured.Smith, 203‚Äì204 However, Mack was wounded in the fight and, with his force, \\"tamely returned to Ulm that night.\\"Rothenberg, 92 On 12 October Mack reorganized his army into four corps under Schwarzenberg, Werneck, Jellaƒçiƒá, and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Riesch. The units were organized similar to the French corps, except that Mack constantly shuffled the component units. That day, Mack issued a flurry of orders, each set countermanding the previous instructions. In sum, he ordered Jellaƒçiƒá to march south to the Tyrol, Schwarzenberg to hold Ulm, and Werneck to move north to Heidenheim an der Brenz followed by General-Major Johann Ludwig Alexius von Loudon's division of Riesch's corps. This was followed by a council of war at which Mack decided to send Riesch along the Danube to destroy all the bridges.Kagan, 421‚Äì422 In one speculative account, the real reason Mack sent Jellaƒçiƒá to the Tyrol was to get rid of Mayer, who led a brigade. Historian Frederick Kagan surmised that Mack was either confused or he deliberately scattered his army to give it a better chance to escape. In any case, Mack soon issued a new set of orders which were similar to the last set. Riesch set out with his command on the 13th, marching on water-logged roads in the direction of Elchingen.Kagan, 423 On 13 October several French corps marched west on the south side of the Danube. Napoleon still hoped to encircle Mack's forces south of the river. He seemed unaware of the possibility that the Austrians could get away on the north bank. That day, Napoleon heard from Ney that only Dupont's division and some cavalry occupied the north bank in force. The French emperor ordered Ney and Marshal Joachim Murat to shift their forces to the north side of the river the next day.Chandler Campaigns, 399 Also on the 13th, Soult wiped out General-Major Karl Spangen von Uyternesse's brigade in the Battle of Memmingen, capturing 4,600 men at the cost of 16 casualties.Smith, 204 Battle =Austrian forces= On 13 October when he arrived at Elchingen, Riesch found Loudon sparring with a French force for control of the bridge over the Danube. Feeling unable to defeat the French, he broke off the fight and merely posted troops to defend the north bank of the river and left the bridge intact with the French in control of the south end of the span. He passively ordered his troops to pitch camp at Elchingen. Kagan proposed that Riesch failed to act more aggressively because he had lost faith in Mack's ability.Kagan, 423‚Äì424 Riesch and an 8,000-man Austrian corps occupied high ground near the villages of Ober- and Unter-Elchingen. Deployed on the heights under Loudon and General-Major Daniel M√©csery were 14 battalions of infantry, 11 squadrons of cavalry, and 12 artillery pieces. The infantry contingent included four battalions each of the Riese Infantry Regiment Nr. 15 and Erbach Infantry Regiment Nr. 42, two battalions of the Archduke Ludwig Infantry Regiment Nr. 8, and the 1st Battalion of the Kaiser Infantry Regiment Nr. 1. The cavalry consisted of six squadrons of the Rosenberg Chevau-l√©ger Regiment Nr. 6, three squadrons of the Hohenzollern Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 8, and two squadrons of the Archduke Franz Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 2.Smith, 204. Smith wrote that there were 14 battalions in total but only named 11 in his order of battle. =Alternate Austrian Order of Battle= An alternate order of battle is given by Scott Bowden in his highly detailed account of the battle.Bowden, 458, In this version Riesch has 32 battalions of infantry (13,300), 12 1/2 squadrons of cavalry (1,250) and 14 guns served by 450 crew, for nearly 15,000 men.

French infantry storm the abbey while dragoons chase fleeing Austrians. Dupont was already north of the Danube with Tilly's horsemen. Ney planned to have Loison's men attack across a partly dismantled bridge directly south of Riesch's position. As soon as the bridge was secure, Murat would send cavalry across to help. Meanwhile, Malher would cross the Danube further east and then sweep west along the north bank. At 8:00 am, Ney sent the elite companies of Villatte's brigade across the bridge where they overpowered the bridge guard. French engineers quickly repaired the span so that when Riesch sent two battalions to interfere, they were driven back by a growing body of French reinforcements.Young-Chandler, 376‚Äì377 Villatte's brigade assaulted the main Austrian position, supported by Colbert's cavalry and ten cannons. Led personally by Ney, the 6th Light rapidly captured the Elchingen Abbey and all of Ober-Elchingen except a brickworks. The 39th Line was driven back by Austrian cavalry, but Loison brought up Roguet's brigade to help. The 69th Line helped roll Riesch's men back into the Grosser Forest. Threatened by Malher from the east and Dupont from the northeast, Riesch began pulling back. Colonel Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes's 18th Dragoons broke an Austrian square after it was softened up by musketry from the 76th Line. Colonel Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's 19th Dragoons also joined the pursuit. A final cavalry charge by the Austrians was checked by Roguet's brigade, then counter-charged by Colbert's horsemen.Young-Chandler, 377. Results Archduke Ferdinand The French admitted losing 56 officers and 737 men killed or wounded. They captured 4,000 Austrians and 4 cannon.Young-Chandler, 377. Young's total French losses (793) are fewer than those given by Smith. Austrian killed and wounded may have been as high as 2,000.Smith, 204. Smith listed 6,000 Austrian casualties. Subtracting the prisoners gives 2,000 killed and wounded. Riesch's survivors retreated to Ulm where they were trapped with Mack. On 14 October Archduke Ferdinand took flight from the city with a cavalry regiment. At this time, large portions of the Austrian army remained outside Napoleon's net. Mack capitulated with 23,500 troops and 60 cannons in the Battle of Ulm on October 20.Rothenberg, 92‚Äì93 In several clashes over the next few days, Murat's pursuit mopped up most of Werneck's corps and other fleeing units. The French clashed with Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen's division at Langenau on 16 October. The next day, Murat and Dupont cut General-Major Rudolf Sinzendorf's brigade to pieces at Herbrechtingen, capturing 2,500 Austrians.Smith, 205 On 18 October, Murat and Ney forced Werneck to capitulate with 15,000 soldiers and 28 artillery pieces at Trochtelfingen. Only Archduke Ferdinand, Prince Hohenzollern, Schwarzenberg, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ignaz Gyulai and 12 squadrons of cavalry escaped into Bohemia.Smith, 206. Smith states that the surrender took place at Trochtelfingen, but this town is too far west. Treuchtlingen may be the correct location but this is not stated in any written account. Far to the south, the French eliminated another fragment of the shattered Austrian army when Jellacic surrendered 4,000 men to Marshal Pierre Augereau's 15,000-man VII Corps at Dornbirn on 13 November.Smith, 214. Rothenberg (p 93) says 14 November. In 1808 Napoleon bestowed the title, the Duke of Elchingen upon Ney as a reward for his victory.Young-Chandler, 363 Footnotes References =Books= * Bowden, Scott. \\"Napoleon and Austerlitz\\" Chicago, The Emperor's Press, 1997, * Chandler, David.

It extends out over seaward across the continental shelf finally connecting to the deep ocean basin at a depth of 3 to 4 km below sea level. It begins as a natural channel of several kilometers width, starting as a 20‚Äì40 m depression at Hudson Channel southward from Ambrose Light, then carving through a deep notch of about 1 km depth in the shelf break, and running down the continental rise. Tidally associated flows of about up and down the deeper parts of the canyon have been recorded. As silt, sand and mud are carried down the Hudson River, they flow into the canyon and out into the deep sea. The Hudson Canyon proper is located about east of the mouth of the Hudson River off the New Jersey coast. Its walls rise from the canyon floor, making it comparable to the Grand Canyon, whose cliffs are over deep and long. It is the largest known ocean canyon off the East Coast of the United States, and one of the largest submarine canyons in the world. The canyon is located near the 100 meter isobath on the continental shelf and is deep at the base of the continental slope. Over an distance, the average slope of the canyon floor is 1.5¬∞. At this point the canyon is as much as wide (from east rim to west rim) and as much as deep from canyon rim to canyon floor across the continental slope. The floor of the canyon is less than wide across the upper part of the slope and broadens to about at the base of the slope. USGS 2006 The canyon was last exposed during the last Ice Age, over 10,000 years ago, when the sea level was about lower and the mouth of the Hudson River was near the edge of the continental shelf, about east of its present site. The river discharged sediment that helped carve the canyon aided by underwater avalanches of mud and sand. Recent maps of the canyon reveal tributaries of an extraordinary underwater drainage network that is strikingly similar to terrestrial rivers. Tidal currents sweep up and down the channel; and on occasion, during big storms, cold ocean water is pushed up the Hudson Canyon to spread out on the shelf. Thus the Hudson Canyon continues to be cut by traveling sediments.Butman, et al., 2006 The Hudson Canyon is thought to contain residues of pollution and trash from the days when New York City's sewage and garbage was dumped directly into the river. If true, many parts of the trench bottom may be covered in sludge. Scientists plan to use new maps of the canyon to track contaminants from six abandoned dump sites off New York Harbor. \\"Hudson Canyon\\" also designates a location marked by a navigational buoy indicating the seaward end of the vessel traffic separation scheme of the Hudson Canyon‚ÄìAmbrose lanes which lead into and out of New York Harbor for Atlantic shipping.

The organization was known as Young Democratic Socialists (YDS) until 2017.  History  Formerly known as the Democratic Socialists of America Youth Section, the organization played a significant role in the 1980s in the movements against apartheid in South Africa and United States intervention in Central America. It helped introduce many student activists to trade union struggles, with many of the organization's alums going on to become labor organizers and union staff members. In the late 1990s, YDSA chapters, most notably the ones at Ithaca College and Arizona State University, became heavily involved in the national movement against the prison-industrial complex. Chapters tried to force colleges to cancel their contracts with food service provider Sodexho Marriott because its parent company Sodexho Alliance owned stock in Corrections Corporation of America, a for-profit prison company. More recently, the YDSA had a contingent march in the NYSPC section of the United for Peace and Justice march against the Iraq War in Washington, D.C. on January 27, 2007.http://www.ydsusa.org/news/YDSA-nyspc-events.html, accessed 2/24/07 In September 2009, YDSA members participated in a march against the G20 in Pittsburgh.http://www.ydsusa.org/news/YDSA-and-the-g-20-protest-in- pittsburgh.html, accessed 2/6/10 In October 2010, dozens of YDSA members joined the union-sponsored One Nation Working Together march in Washington, D.C.

It has an especially powerful search system utilizing flexible search patterns. It was initially created for Debian, but has appeared in RPM Package Manager (RPM) based distributions as well (such as Conectiva). User interfaces aptitude is based on the ncurses computer terminal library, with which it provides an interface that incorporates some elements commonly seen in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (such as pull-down menus). In addition to the ncurses interface, aptitude provides an extensive command-line interface (CLI). Even though aptitude is one executable file, it provides command-line functions similar to those of apt- family of tools (apt-get, apt-cache, apt- listchanges, etc.). aptitude also emulates most command-line arguments, allowing it to act as a full replacement for . In the past, it was recommended that aptitude and apt-get not be used interchangeably. This is no longer true, as both programs now correctly track and share a common list of packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies. History aptitude was created in 1999. At the time two other terminal-based APT-like front-ends were available: the dselect program, which had been used to manage packages on Debian since before APT was created, and the console-apt program, a project that was considered to be the heir apparent to dselect. aptitude was created to experiment with a more object-oriented programming design than that used in console-apt, in the hope that this would result in a more flexible program with a broader set of features. The first public release of aptitude was version 0.0.1 on November 18, 1999. It was very limited: it had the ability to view the list of available packages, but could not actually download or install any packages. By version 0.0.4a, this ability had been added, with many other improvements; this version was included in Debian 2.2, code name: . In late 2000, the whole user interface module was rewritten; a new architecture was created, based on the libsigc++ callback library and concepts from modern widget toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt. This enabled the interface to become much more similar to GUIs than it had been previously, with features such as pull-down menus and pop-up dialogs. One of aptitude's more unusual features, a tiny implementation of Minesweeper, was added at this time. The first official aptitude release following this rewrite was 0.2.0., aptitude 0.2.11.1 was released with Debian 3.0 Woody. By this time, the project (renamed to ) had been effectively abandoned by its maintainers, and it was removed from Woody. aptitude has also been ported to jailbroken iOS as part of the Cydia package manager. Easter egg A version of the aptitude Easter egg. It is a reference to The Little Prince. aptitude states that, unlike Advanced Packaging Tool, it \\"does not have Super Cow Powers\\". In apt-get \\"super cow powers\\" can be found by issuing the command . However, in aptitude issuing moo will give the user a prompt saying there are no Easter eggs. However, by issuing , then , and so on the user will see a series of statements denying the \\"Super Cow Powers\\" or telling them to go away, some ending with a picture (a reference to Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's The Little Prince) not unlike the original apt-get Easter egg.

They are found mostly on hunting spiders, especially Lycosidae and Salticidae. Scopulae consist of microscopic hairs, known as setae, which are each covered in even smaller hairs called setules or \\"end feet\\", resulting in a large contact area. When the scopulae are splayed out and placed against a surface, remarkable adhesion is produced due to the accumulation of adhesion of each individual setule interacting with a substrate. The adhesion may be due to the excretion of liquid from adhesive pads, although setae can adhere in both dry and wet modes.Peattie, A. Dirks, J. Henriques, S. and W. Federle. 2011. Arachnids secrete a fluid over their adhesive pads. PLoSOne 6(5): e20485. This enables spiders with scopulae to climb even sheer, smooth surfaces such as glass. The adhesion is so great that the spider could grip using this force and support 170 times its own weight. Possible physical mechanisms may include capillary, electrostatic, viscous, or Van der Waals force. (Niederegger et al 2002; Betz and K√∂lsch, 2004) Scopulae have been used in taxonomy to identify families, especially Mygalomorphae.

Born and raised in western Canada, he trained as an artist there but was not drawn to traditional Canadian art. Instead he was inspired by images of Diego Rivera's work in a magazine to move to Mexico when he was only eighteen. He studied further in Mexico, focusing his education and his career mostly on murals, creating a type of work he called a \\"portable mural\\" as a way to adapt it to new architectural style. He also had a successful career creating canvas works as well with several notable series of paintings. He spent most of his life and career in Mexico except for a stay in New York City in the late 1960s to mid-1970s. His best known works are the murals he created for the University Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in the Iztapalapa borough of Mexico City. Life Belkin was born on December 9, 1930 with the name Arnold Lewis Belken Greenberg in Calgary, Alberta. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant who became prominent in the Vancouver Jewish community when the family moved there shortly after Belkin's birth. His mother was a Jewish immigrant from England. He began drawing and painting at an early age. His parents were socialist, which would affect his later artwork, giving him an harshal in social issues and the rights of the underprivileged. He began formal art training at the Vancouver School of Art, studying there from 1945 to 1947. At age 15, Belkin won first place an art contest with the Labor Arts Guild in British Columbia with the painting \\"Workers on a Streetcar.\\" From 1947 to 1948 he studied at the Banff School of Fine Arts. During his training, Belkin was not drawn to traditional Canadian painting which was heavily focused on landscapes. At age 14 he discovered the work of Diego Rivera and Mexican muralism from Time magazine. He discovery of contemporary Mexican art made a great impact and in 1948 at the age of eighteen, he left Canada to move to Mexico. He enrolled into the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" from 1948 to 1949, studying with Agust√≠n Lazo, Carlos Orozco Romero and Andr√©s S√°nchez Flores. In Mexico City, he was surrounded by the mural work of the first half of the 20th century, with its emphasis on class struggle and oppression. At La Esmeralda, he focused on this kind of painting, being influenced by the work of Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Rico Lebrun and Leonard Baskin. Lock Haven University, PA, USA In 1950 he traveled to various parts of Mexico, especially the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. From this trip, he wrote a script for a radio documentary on the region's music, customs and legends, produced by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the same year, he met David Alfaro Siqueiros, forming both a personal and professional relationship. He was an assistant on two murals from that time Patricios y Patricidas at the former customs building in Santo Domingo along with the Cuauht√©moc mural at the Palacio de Bellas Artes from 1950 to 1951. The experience not only influence his style but also taught him the level of quality expected in Mexican muralism. In the early 1950s he joined the Taller de Ensayo de Materiales y Pl√°sticos run by Prof. Jos√© L. Gut√≠errez at the Instituto Politecnico Nacional, participating in the creation of various collective murals. From 1954 to 1956, he studied engraving in metal with Lola Cueto at Mexico City College and lithography from the Escuela de Artes del Libro with Pedro Castelar Baez. He also participated in the workshop of Guillermo Silva Santamar√≠a where he met Francisco Icaza and Leonel G√≥ngora. Beltran spent most of the rest of his life in Mexico, except for a trip to Europe and a number of years spent in New York City in the 1970s, connecting with American painters such as Omar Rayo, Rudolph Abularach, C√©sar Paternosto and Rubens Gerchman . For Expo 67 in Montreal, he represented Mexico rather than Canada. He returned to Mexico to stay in 1976, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1981. He was married once, to dancer Esperanza G√≥mez with whom he had two daughters. After they divorced, he had numerous relationships but did not remarry or have more children. At the time of his death, his partner was Patricia Quijano, and he had one grandchild. Belkin died in Mexico City on July 3, 1992 from lung cancer at age 61. He was buried at the Pante√≥n Judio in Mexico City with honors. Career UAM library at night with mural by Belkin Belkin's career spanned more than three decades, during which time he produced 28 major public murals, various smaller ones, with about ninety individual exhibitions and over fifty collective ones in Mexico and abroad and designed sets and costumes for forty Mexican stage productions, as well as other activities. =Murals= After graduating from La Esmeralda, Belkin began to work at the Taller de Ensayo de Materiales y Plasticos belonging to Jos√© L. Gutierrez. With this group he worked on various collective murals as well as his first individual mural called ¬°El pueblo no quiere la guerra! in 1950, a fresco painted at the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional, since destroyed. During the rest of the decade, he painted a number of murals in various parts of the country. In 1952 he painted Canto a la tierra, several fresco panels based on poems by Nezahualcoyotl at the Banco de Monterrey. In 1956 he painted La bah√≠a de Acapulco at the Hotel Continental Hilton in Mexico City which was destroyed by the 1985 earthquake. In the same year, he painted Figuras de Tlatilco at a private home in Xalapa, Veracruz. In 1957 he painted the mural Escenas de Don Quijote at the La Casa de Piedra in Cuernavaca. From 1960 to 1961 he painted a mural on a federal prison in Mexico City called Todos somos culpables. This tells the story of a criminal committing crime, getting caught and punished but from a social worker point of view rather than a law-and-order one. In 1963 he painted a mural at the Centro Pedag√≥ogico Infantil called A nuestra generaci√≥n corresponde decidir. However, it was later painted over by the director of Child Services, wife of President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos because it was considered to be \\"too sad.\\" In 1966 he created the mural Las festivades jud√≠as for the Kehila Ashkenazi in Mexico City. From the late 1960s to mid-1970s, Belkin lived and worked in New York City. One major mural done here was a wall in Hell's Kitchen measuring almost 40,000 square feet from 1972 to 1973. To complete the extremely large project, he enlisted help from anyone willing to be taught. The result was Against Domestic Colonialism belonging not only to the artist but the community. Over the decades, this mural has escaped most of the graffiti that covers most other surfaces in the area. He painted a number of other murals in the New York City area. In 1971 he was artist-in-residence at the Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. He also painted Epimiteo on the cafeteria walls of Dumont High School in New Jersey in 1973. When he returned to Mexico, he continued to paint murals. From 1978 to 1979 he created La migraci√≥n sefard√≠ en M√©xico at the Centro Social Monte Sina√≠ in Mexico City. In 1981 he painted A trav√©s de la technolog√≠a for the Colegio de Ingenieros Mec√°nicos y Electricistas. In the 1980s he worked on a series of works for the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in Iztapalapa. It is this work for which he is best known. The murals total six : El hombre y el cosmos, Genesis de un nuevo orden(1988), Omniciencia (1984), Imagenes de nuestros dias, Una utopia posible (1983-1984), Muerte de la ignorancia and Transformacion de la sociedad (1986), as well as a number of sculptures. He became the artist-in-residence for the institution in 1983 and starting painting the Teatro del Fuego Nuevo as part of a course he taught there, finishing in 1984. He finished the last mural in 1988 on Building E after painting the library and the social sciences building. During this period, he also painted from 1985 to 1986 the mural Identidad y futuro the Colegio Madrid. This work depicts the Spanish Civil War and the Republican exiles that arrived to Mexico. In 1987 he traveled to Managua, Nicaragua to paint Los prometeos on the Palacio Nacional H√©roes y M√°rtires de la Revoluci√≥n. The mural features Emiliano Zapata, Augusto C√©sar Sandino and Prometheus, with the two revolutionaries being compared to the mythical Greek figure who brought fire to man. At the end of the 1980s, he became interested in reinterpreting the discovery of the Americas by the Europeans resulting in murals called Descubrimiento y conquista del Nuevo Mundo (1988-1989) at the Biblioteca P√∫blica de Popotla and 1492 (1991). This would be his last major work. Los hermanos Serd√°n. La lucha contin√∫a (1977), de Arnold Belkin In addition to more traditional works, Belkin created what he called \\"portal murals,\\" large scale paintings which can be moved and adapted as a way to deal with changing architectural tastes such as lower walls and the use of prefabricated panels. He created ten major pieces of this type of work. The first of these was in 1959 called the Levanamiento del Ghetto de Varsovia or Warsaw Ghetto Uprising which was later acquired by the Vancouver Jewish Community Center. These were followed later by Massacre at Kent State in 1970 (1974), The My Lai Massacre in 1976 and Los hermanos Serd√°n: la lucha contin√∫a, which was acquired by the state of Puebla for the Casa de los hermanos Serd√°n. Another major piece from the 1970s was for the Museo Nacional de Historia called La llegada de los generals Zapata y Villa al Palacio Nacional el 6 diciembre de 1914. In 1986 he created the portable mural called La vocaci√≥n de la maestra Magdalena and in 1990 he did Inventando el futuro for the engineering school at UNAM. At various points in his career, Belkin was a professor and teacher, mostly related to mural work. In 1956 he began teaching mural painting at the Universidad de las Americas. From 1971 to 1972 he gave painting classes at the New School for Social Research and The Art Students League in New York City. From 1972 to 1973 he was a guest lecturer at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. In the later 1970s to the 1980s he taught various workshops in Mexico resulting in collective murals done by students. These include a mural to journalist Francisco Zarco at Callej√≥n Francisco Zarco (1977), a mural called La historia del movimiento obrero at Parque Juventino Rosas in the Magdalena Contreras borough and Ra√≠ces de las flores Nelhuayotl on the borough hall of Xochimilco all in Mexico City done by students from ENAP. From 1983 to 1984, he gave a course about the uses of photography in paintings at the Museo Universitario del Chopo. =Canvas work and exhibitions= In addition to murals, Belkin also created a large number of canvas works with which he had success in exhibitions. His first individual exhibition was at the Instituto Cultural Anglo-Mexicano sponsored by the Canadian Embassy in 1952, with the introduction written by David Alfaro Siqueiros.- This was followed by other individual exhibitions in Mexico along with exhibitions in Vancouver and Calgary in 1953m, 1958 and 1959. In 1960 he exhibited at the Academy of San Carlos. His first exhibition in the United States was at the Zora Gallery in Los Angeles in 1961. Along with Siqueiros, Icaza and Tamayo and his was invited to represent Mexico at the International Award Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 1966, he participated in the group show Confrontaci√≥n 66 organized by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. His fame increased in the 1970s with exhibitions in the United States, Venezuela, Colombia and Cuba. Belkin's easel paintings also enjoyed much success during his time in New York. In 1970 he began a series of sixteen paintings related to the death of physicist and politician Juan Pablo Marat. These were exhibited at the Lerner-Heller Gallery in New York in 1972. From 1972 to 1975 he had various individual exhibitions in Detroit, Houston, Atlanta, Dayton, Phoenix and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1974 he began a series of paintings called Historic Battles, considered to be some of his best canvas work. It is a series of large scale paintings, including Massacre at Kent State, My Lai Massacre and the Military Coup in Chile of 1973. While many are of contemporary topics, they also included paraphrases of compositions by masters of European art of past centuries such as Nicolas Poussin's The Rape of the Sabines. However all deal with the violence of armed men during war against the defenseless. He also painted images of the future and of utopia, such as Armoured Figure done in New York. This one is a warning against technology enslaving the human spirit. In 1977 he had an individual exhibition at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1979, he was invited by the Cuban government to do an individual exhibition at the Casa de las Am√©ricas of his work during the 1970s. This included some of his portable murals. His other major series of paintings is dedicated to Emiliano Zapata, started in 1979. These works are a kind of documentary based on photographs and other visual references to the Mexican Revolution figure. They include works done in pencil, ink and crayon and served as sketches for larger works about Zapata later in his career. From 1981 to 1982 he worked on a series of drawings and paintings called Los amantes based on love poems by Mario Benedetti. The series also included photographs by Rafael Doniz of lovers embracing in the middle of scenes of social conflict. From 1985 to 1986 he created the Lucio Caba√±as series, which are large scale drawings on amate paper which feature the revolutionary along with Sandino and Pedro Albizu Campos. The triptych Tlatelolco, lugar del sacrificio (1989) ties the events of 1521, 1968 and 1985. In 1982 he had an individual exhibition at the Museo de Arte Moderno. In 1983 he presented an exhibition of drawings from 1957 to 1983 at the Casa del Lago. =Other activities= In the first half of the 1950s, Belkin became interested in music, dance and theatre. From 1951 to 1954 he drew dancers and began to design sets and costumes for various ballets such as Tierra by Elena Noriega, El mu√±eco y los hombrecillos, El debate and Advenimiento de la luz by Xavier Francis. From 1955 to 1960 he did set design for Seki Sano, H√©ctor Mendoza and Luis de Tavira for productions such as Cinco preciosidades francesas and El D√©cimo hombre. In 1966 he created the set of the work Don Gel de las calzas verdes by Tirso de Molina, directed by H√©ctor Mendoza. In 1982 he created the set for Lances de amor y fortuna by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca directed by Luis de Tavira. In 1983 he created the set for El destierro by Juan Tovar, directed by Jos√© Caballero. In 1983 he designed the wardrobe, set and lighting for the work Herej√≠a by Sabina Berman directed by Abraham Oceransky, which received the Premio Nacional de Teatro in the same year. In 1984 he designed the set for Los dos hermanos by Felipe Santander. His engraving work is not very well known but it has been exhibited and has received awards. In 1972 his work was recognized at the II Bienal Latinoamericana de Grabado in San Juan. In 1987 he created five engravings called Los conquistadores which became part of the El Inicio de Nueva Espa√±a display at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia. After his death, his work featured in an exhibition called Arte Gr√°fico Latinoamericano (1970-1980)\\" at the state government building in Villahermosa, Tabasco, as well as an exhibition at the Benem√©rita Universidad Aut√≥noma de Puebla in 2011. In 1961 he formed the Grupo de Interioristas along with Francisco Icaza, which was concerned with the Cold War and commercialism with the widespread use of plastic. The group focused on creating monochromatic images which became their trademark. The name Interioristas was coined by art critic Selden Rodman. In 1961 he co-authored the manifesto Nueva Presencia:el hombre en el arte de nuestro tiempo with Francisco Icaza, which was against so-called bourgeois art and academic art of \\"good taste\\" in favor of that with political and social messages. This led to the formation of the group Nueva Presencia with included Leonel G√≥ngora, Francisco Corzas, Jos√© Mu√±oz Medina, Artemio Sepulveda, Rafael Coronel and Nacho L√≥pez. From 1967 to 1968 he created the Museo Latinoamericano with Omar Rayo, Leonel G√≥ngora, Abularach, Paternosto, Gerchman and others because he was unhappy with attitudes towards Latin American shown by the Center for Inter-American Relations. The idea the museum was that Latin American artists were better able to present the art and culture of the region more than capitalists from the United States. He also founded the Taller del Muralismo Comunitario in 1978. He published a catalog of lithographs called Two with poems by Jack Hirschman published by Zora Gallery in 1963. In 1987 he published a book called Contra la amnesia: textos 1960-1985. He created postcards at various points in his life included one in 1966 for the Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes featuring Eolo, Greek goddess of wind, one in 1981 for the Secretar√≠a de Relaciones Exteriores to honor the bicentennial of the birth of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and one in 1988 for the Mexican postal service with a portrait of C√©sar Vallejo. He also did a few sculptures which include a large scale one in 1981 called El Estudiante for the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa and one in 1986 for the Jard√≠n Escult√≥rico at the Bosque L√°zaro C√°rdenas in Morelia. In 1988 he created the cover to the social science textbook for public schools in Mexico. =Recognition= In 1960 he received an award from the Asociaci√≥n de Cr√≠ticos Teatrales for best scene design for his work on Terror y miserias del III Reich by Bertolt Brecht. El hombre si tiene future (homenaje a Bertrand Russell) won the Adquisici√≥n del Sal√≥n de Pintura prize in 1963. Also in 1963, he received an honorary mention at the Casa de las Am√©ricas for a catalogue of lithographs he made in Los Angeles. In 1982 the mural Traici√≥n y muerte de Zapata and El asesinato de Rub√©n Jaramillo y su familia mayo 22 de 1962 won the Winfred Lam Grand Prize at the I Bienal in Havana, Cuba. He keynoted the III Coloquio Latinoamericano de Fotograf√≠a in Havana talking about his experience using photography in his art. In 1986 there was a retrospective of his mural work at the Galer√≠a Metropolitana in Mexico City. In 1987 UNAM published a book about the artist. There have been a number of posthumous retrospectives and other exhibitions of his work including the 1997 the exhibition at the Museo Mural Diego Rivera and was honored at an event at the Museo Universitario del Chopo in 1998. Artistry Arnold Belkin has been referred to as the \\"Canadian son of Mexican muralism.\\" He is best known for his murals such as those at Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in Iztapalapa. There are thirty murals of the artist still in existence in Mexico, Nicaragua and the United States. He is credited with continuing the Mexican muralism tradition in the mid-20th century when the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura headed by artists like Jos√© Luis Cuevas and Rafael Coronel were taking the Mexican art scene away from muralism and its Marxist tendencies. Most of his murals are in public and educational spaces keeping the tradition of murals as a way to communicate with the masses and the following generations keeping murals an important part of Mexican culture. From the muralist generation, Belkin not only learned traditional painting techniques but also new ones, influenced by the work of Siqueiros. This included painting with air brushes and creating images using photographs projected on a wall as a base. His works are characterized in the use of intense, dark and often ochre colors in the entire work depicting the human body as central along with geometric figures. They often aim to tie the past with the present with themes such as war, peace, death, injustice and exile. He believed that art should serve as a teaching tool and to spark political discourse, often presenting humanity's most controversial and painful experiences. He generally did not produce works merely for aesthetics. He painted historical scenes, never allegory and although his work was influenced by the socialist ideals of his parents, his heroes were those of Latin America, not Canada. These heroes included the Serd√°n brothers, Francisco Villa, Emiliano Zapata, Francisco I. Madero, Lucio Caba√±as, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Christopher Columbus. He did paint some other subjects, for example in the 1970s he created pieces criticizing the automatization of modern life, depicting men as robots. His work went through a number of phases. His early paintings starting in the early 1950s were focused on popular traditions in Mexico, especially those related to death such as Entierro in 1952. He was influenced by Rico Lebrun who visited Mexico in the 1960s resulting in works which were monochromatic emphasizing the use of grays, sepias, ochres and black. Two notable works of this type are Resurrecci√≥n in 1960 and Presagio y Seres terrestres in 1961.In the mid-1960s he experimented with abstract art with all forms being distorted. Works from this period include Paisaje interior (1964), Imagen humana (1965) and Los colores del d√≠a son los que te visten, el resto es silencio (1966). In the late 1960s his work featured figures surrounded by circles and ovals,which include El eclipse (1968), Progresi√≥n II (1969) and Language-system (1970). In 1968 he visited to Europe, where his work acquired a more dynamic character, even denouncing his previous static work. Europe's old masters also inspired a series called Historic battles which were reinterpretations of classic works. His work took on a strong ochre tone in the 1970s when he began to work in oils and sculpture. focused on human emotions such as loneliness, desperation, abandonment and misery.

It is owned by the Tennessee chapter of The Nature Conservancy.Hubbard's Cave, The Nature Conservancy website, accessed April 26, 2007 Hubbard's Cave is ecologically significant because it serves as a hibernaculum for two Federally endangered bat species, the gray bat (Myotis grisescens) and the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis). The cave is known to be the largest gray bat hibernaculum in Tennessee with a population of over 500,000 gray bats. Five other bat species also hibernate in the cave. Hibernating bats are extremely sensitive to disturbance during the hibernation period. Since they have stored up just enough energy to survive through the winter, rousing them forces the use of these precious stores. In many instances the bats will be unable to survive the winter. Consequently, the cave entrances have been gated to prevent disturbance of the bats during their hibernation. The cave consists of three entrances (branches) at the base of a large sinkhole. It is surrounded by a mesic oak-hickory forest. In addition to its biological importance, Hubbard's Cave has played an extensive role in human history and prehistory. During the Civil War, the cave was heavily mined for saltpeter to produce gunpowder. The west passage in particular is littered with evidence of this historic human use. Researchers are still working to record all of the signatures found on the walls of this passage. Unfortunately, many of the historic signatures have been covered by the spray paint of modern graffiti caused by vandals. Artifacts from the saltpeter mining works have been found scattered throughout this passage, including a remarkable ladder that was burned and nearly destroyed by vandals in 1997. Prehistoric human use is also evident in Hubbard's Cave. Most notable are the pieces of cane torches found throughout the west passage. Incredibly preserved because of the dry conditions, these fragments have been carbon dated to be around 2,000 years old.

The comptroller is elected, citywide, to a four-year term and can hold office for two consecutive terms. The current comptroller is Democrat Scott Stringer, the former Borough President of Manhattan. Stringer was elected on November 5, 2013. Duties The comptroller is responsible for auditing the performance and finances of city agencies, making recommendations regarding proposed contracts, issuing reports on the state of the city economy, marketing and selling municipal bonds, and managing city debt. The comptroller also \\"is the custodian and investment advisor to the Boards\\" of the five pension funds which are collectively referred to as \\"NYC Public Pension Funds\\" or \\"New York City pension funds\\". The funds collectively amounted to as of September 30, 2014. The comptroller's regulations are compiled in title 44 of the New York City Rules. History The office was created as an appointive office in 1801. Thirty years later, the comptroller became head of the department of finance. In 1884 the office became elective, and in 1938 the comptroller became head of a separate, independent department of the City's government. Until it was found unconstitutional in 1989, the comptroller served on the eight-member New York City Board of Estimate, which was composed of the Mayor of New York City, the comptroller and the president of the New York City Council, each of whom was elected citywide and had two votes, and the five Borough presidents, each having one vote. If vacancies should simultaneously occur in the offices of Mayor of New York City and New York City Public Advocate (formerly president of the city council or board of aldermen), the comptroller would become acting mayor. These have been the three offices elected citywide, so traditional practice has tried to balance a winning three-candidate ticket among the city's different ethnic, religious and political interests (and, more recently, between the sexes). But, while there is a delicate interaction between the campaigns for the three offices, the actual election results can sometimes differ quite markedly. 2009 election The Democratic nominee in the 2009 general election, John Liu won 76% of the citywide vote on Tuesday, November 3. The Republican nominee, Joseph Mendola, won 19.3%; the Conservative nominee, Stuart Avrick, 2.5%; and others 2.3%.The New York Times coverage of the 2009 NYC Comptroller race, September 29, 2009; retrieved September 26, 2013.Coverage of the 2009 NYC Comptroller race, manhattan.about.com2009 New York City Comptroller election results , The New York Times, published and retrieved November 3, 2009. 2013 election Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer won the September 10, 2013 Democratic primary with 52% of the vote, defeating former New York State Governor, Eliot Spitzer, who had been forced to resign as governor over various scandals.Eliot Spitzer fails in his New York political comeback attempt, Reuters, published and retrieved September 11, 2013.

Salamonie was laid down on 5 February 1940 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 13) as Esso Columbia by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia.; launched on 18 September 1940; sponsored by Mrs. Eugene Holman; designated for US Navy use on 20 November 1940; and commissioned on 28 April 1941, Commander T.M. Waldschmidt in command. Service history =World War II= After runs to various North American Atlantic Ocean ports, Salamonie got underway for her first overseas mission on 13 November 1942 in a large convoy headed for Casablanca, North Africa. Then, after several convoys to the United Kingdom the oiler was overhauled in Norfolk, Virginia, and fitted with radar. On 12 February 1943 in the North Atlantic Salamonie suffered a steering fault and accidentally rammed the troopship USAT Uruguay amidships. The tanker's bow made a hole in Uruguays hull and penetrated her hospital, killing 13 soldiers and injuring 50. One soldier landed on the tanker's deck, where he was not discovered until Salamonie had changed course to Bermuda for repairs. Salamonie sailed for the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal on 8 July 1944 and reported for duty to Commander Service Force, US 7th Fleet, at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 23 August. Salamonie joined the Leyte invasion force in Hollandia on 8 October 1944 and later supported both the Morotai and Mindoro strike forces. She spent the final months of the war supporting Allied operations in the Philippines. The sole war casualty on Salamonie was caused by a strafing run by a single Japanese plane on 5 January 1945. Following the formal Japanese surrender, the oiler provided logistic services to the Shanghai occupation forces along the Huangpu River. =Post-war= Early in 1946 Salamonie returned to California for an overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard; then sailed back across the Pacific. The next two and a half years were spent shuttling petroleum products between Bahrain in the Persian Gulf and United States naval bases in the Far East. After returning to Long Beach, California in December 1948, Salamonie was assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet and arrived at Norfolk in May 1949. Western Atlantic and Caribbean operations with the US 2nd Fleet and deployments with the US 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea took the oiler through the 1950s and well into the 1960s. In August and September 1958 Salamonie was part of Navy Task Force 88 (TF-88), during Operation Argus, which was involved in conducting nuclear tests in the very high atmosphere. Toward the end of the 1960s she was designated for inactivation. Placed in reserve on 23 August 1968 and decommissioned on 20 December, Salamonie's name was struck from the Navy List on 2 September 1969. She was transferred permanently to the Maritime Administration and laid up in the James River, where she remained until 24 September 1970 when her hulk was sold to N. U. Intershitra of Rotterdam, Netherlands, for scrapping.

In the case of capacitance, one analogy to a capacitor in mechanical rectilineal terms is a spring where the compliance of the spring is analogous to the capacitance. Thus in electrical engineering, a capacitor may be defined as an ideal electrical component which satisfies the equation :V = \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int I\\\\,dt, where V = voltage measured at the terminals of the capacitor, C = the capacitance of the capacitor, I = current flowing between the terminals of the capacitor, and t = time. The equation quoted above has the same form as that describing an ideal massless spring: :F = k\\\\int v\\\\,dt, where: F is the force applied between the two ends of the spring, k is the stiffness, or spring constant (inverse of compliance) defined as force/displacement, and v is the speed (or velocity) of one end of the spring, the other end being fixed.

He is the voice behind the Truth For Life Christian radio preaching and teaching ministry, which broadcasts his sermons daily to stations across North America through over 1,800 radio outlets. He is also the author of several books, and has played one small role as an actor in Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius. Begg is a strong advocate of historic Protestant Evangelical theology. He emphasizes his belief in the importance of believing the Bible to be the completely authoritative Word of God, and the importance of using the mind to know the Bible and knowing God through repentance and faith in Jesus. Biography Begg was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1952 and still carries a distinctive Scottish accent after nearly 30 years of ministry in the United States. On 2 November 1972, his mother died. Regarding the incident, Begg wrote that \\"more spiritual progress is made through failure and tears than success and laughter.\\"Made for His Pleasure (p106) Begg graduated from the London School of Theology in 1975 and then served eight years in Scotland at Charlotte Chapel in Edinburgh and Hamilton Baptist Church in Lanarkshire. Begg is a council member of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals. He was also educated at Trent University and Westminster Seminary. Among his influences are Martyn Lloyd-Jones, John Stott, Derek Prime, Eric Alexander, Sinclair Ferguson, Dick Lucas, Eric Liddell, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Jim Elliot, and Hudson Taylor. Begg's wife, Susan, is American by birth and Begg himself became a U.S. citizen in 2004. He and his wife have been married over 30 years and have three grown children. He is a supporter of Scottish football side Rangers F.C. Theological views Begg believes in the inerrancy and supremacy of Scripture, and in the saving power of Christ alone. He has said that the core belief of Parkside Church is \\"that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has died as an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and that to know Him is to know life, both now and forever [...] Jesus Christ is the only Savior, because Jesus is the only one who is qualified to save.\\" Fellow theologian and author R.C. Sproul wrote that \\"Alistair Begg incarnates this Neo-Puritan movement, a humble champion who has been galvanized by a magnificent obsession with the God-centered life. [...] Begg is an anachronism.

The actual blood stream blockage/restriction site can be located far away from the infarcts. Watershed locations are those border-zone regions in the brain supplied by the major cerebral arteries where blood supply is decreased. Watershed strokes are a concern because they comprise approximately 10% of all ischemic stroke cases. The watershed zones themselves are particularly susceptible to infarction from global ischemia as the distal nature of the vasculature predisposes these areas to be most sensitive to profound hypoperfusion. Watershed strokes are localized to two primary regions of the brain, and are termed cortical watersheds (CWS) and internal watersheds (IWS). Patients with many different cardiovascular diseases have a higher likelihood of experiencing a blood clot or loss of blood flow in border-zone regions of the brain. The resulting symptoms differ based on the affected area of the brain. A CT scan and MRI are used for diagnosis, and afterward several treatment options are available, including the removal of atherosclerotic plaque and a physical widening of the clogged blood vessel. Long-term care is focused around three areas: rehabilitative therapy, surgical interventions, and prevention of future watershed strokes. Going forward, research to combat watershed strokes is focusing on various topics, such as stem cell research. Signs and symptoms Watershed stroke symptoms are due to the reduced blood flow to all parts of the body, specifically the brain, thus leading to brain damage. Initial symptoms, as promoted by the American Stroke Association, are FAST, representing F = Facial weakness (droop), A = Arm weakness (drift), S = Speech difficulty (slur), and T = Time to act (priority of intervention). All strokes are considered a medical emergency. Any one of these symptoms, whether seen alone or in combination, should be assumed to be stroke until proven otherwise. Emergency medical help should be sought IMMEDIATELY if any or all of these symptoms are seen or experienced. Early diagnosis and timely medical intervention can drastically reduce the severity of a stroke, limit damage to the brain, improve the chances of a full recovery and reduce recovery times massively. After the initial stroke, other symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. If one of the three central nervous system pathways is affected, symptoms can include numbness, reduced sensation, and hyperreflexia. Most often, the side of the brain damaged results in body defects on the opposite side. Since the cranial nerves originate from the brainstem, damage to this area can lead to defects in the function of these nerves. Symptoms can include altered breathing, problems with balance, drooping of eyelids, and decreased sensation in the face.Martini, F, Nath, J, Bartholomew, E 2012. \\"Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology.\\", p. 742-43. Pearson Education Inc, San Francisco. . Damage to the cerebral cortex may lead to aphasia or confusion and damage to the cerebellum may lead to lack of motor movement. Stroke presentations which are particularly suggestive of a watershed stroke include bilateral visual loss, stupor, and weakness of the proximal limbs, sparing the face, hands and feet. Causes  Watershed strokes are caused by ischemia or a lack of blood flow to the brain. There are several causes of ischemia, including embolism and atherosclerosis. There are several conditions that can predispose someone to watershed stroke by increasing the likelihood that insufficient blood supply will be able to reach the brain. People with many different cardiovascular diseases have a higher likelihood of experiencing a clot or a plaque that impedes flow through a blood vessel. Cardiovascular diseases that increase the risk of ischemia include: *Congestive heart failure, which can lead to an inability to pump sufficient amounts of blood to the brain *Atherosclerosis, which can cause a buildup of cholesterol plaques in the blood vessels, thereby decreasing the volume of blood that can flow through the vessel and reach the brain *Angiopathy, a disease of the blood vessels *Arterial hypotension, or low blood pressure in the arteries *Hypertension, or high blood pressure *Hyperlipidemia, or excessive cholesterol buildup in the blood vessels *Diseases such as sickle cell anemia, which can lead to deformed red blood cells clogging blood vessels and impeding blood flow *Carotid artery stenosis, or narrowing of the carotid artery which can decrease the volume of blood flow to the brain Pathogenesis Although many imaging techniques are used to document watershed strokes, their pathogenesis remains controversial. It may involve various mechanisms such as systemic hypotension, microemboli, severe arterial stenosis, ICA occlusion or a combination of these. =Anatomy= Outer surface of cerebral hemisphere, showing areas supplied by cerebral arteries. Pink is the region supplied by the middle cerebral artery, blue is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery and yellow is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery. Cortical watershed strokes occur at the borders between those areas. These events are localized to two primary regions of the brain: # Cortical watershed strokes (CWS), or outer brain infarcts, are located between the cortical territories of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). # Internal watershed strokes (IWS), or subcortical brain infarcts, are located in the white matter along and slightly above the lateral ventricle, between the deep and the superficial arterial systems of the MCA, or between the superficial systems of the MCA and ACA. Nonetheless, within the literature itself, there exists confusion over the terminology used to describe cortical (outer brain) infarcts and subcortical (inner brain) infarcts. Besides watershed, border-zone is another common term used to refer to areas of the brain between the ends of two adjacent arteries. Other less used terms include: borderland, end zone, boundary zone, and terminal zone. These varying terms have arisen from the considerable anatomic variability both in the cerebral vascular structure and the territories of the brain that they supply. =Hypotension= A sharp drop in blood pressure is the most frequent cause of watershed infarcts. The most frequent location for a watershed stroke is the region between the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. These events caused by hypotension do not usually cause the blood vessel to rupture. =Microemboli= Microemboli have not been experimentally proven to cause watershed strokes. It is unclear whether they are a cause or an effect of a watershed stroke. With watershed strokes, platelet aggregates block the small meningeal arteries in watershed regions creating a microembolism. Microemboli usually form as thrombi, and can block arteries outright. On the other hand, they often detach, move into blood circulation, and eventually block smaller downstream branches of arteries causing a thromboembolism. Generally, emboli travel as far outward as their size permits along the vascular branches of the brain. Using this hypothesis, microemboli are viewed as the cause of the infarct rather than secondary events. Nevertheless, secondary thrombi do form after infarcts, and therefore it has been difficult to distinguish between emboli and thrombi in watershed locations. The best supporting evidence is correlative; patients display subcortical abnormalities on CT scans and present more microembolic signals during a carotid endarterectomy. Microemboli can be common in some high-risk patients, such as those with carotid stenosis. However, in healthier patients strokes do not usually result from microemboli. =ICA occlusions= Thrombi at the split of the internal carotid artery in the neck may cause watershed infarcts between the territories of the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery. The resulting watershed infarcts in carotid artery blockages have mostly been considered to be due to a reduced blood flow, similar to that of hypotension. Imaging studies in severe internal carotid artery (ICA) disease report an incidence of watershed stroke ranging from 19% to 64%. Almost 40% of these watershed infarcts are attributed to narrowing of the carotid artery, which produces the reduced blood flow. However, a different possible explanation has emerged. Alternatively, the vascular occlusion could be the result of microemboli from the carotid thrombi before the lumen becomes completely blocked. In this scenario, the clotting becomes too severe and the clot breaks free. The resulting traveling clot is known as an embolus (plural emboli). The wall of internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation (split) is a common site of atherosclerosis because of the unique hemodynamic effects caused by the blood flow divider. As a result, thrombi formation is more prevalent there. In general, researches have observed that this microembolization is a frequent phenomenon during the build-up of cerebral thrombi. The resulting emboli are pieces of calcified plaque. If these microemboli are 0.1 mm in diameter, they might pass into the small branches of the vascular system. There they may be destroyed by protective cellular defenses, or they may cause a stroke. Altogether, these considerations suggest that the watershed infarcts in carotid thrombosis are caused by microembolization from mural thrombi, thrombi adherent to the vessel wall, rather than by blood flow disturbances. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a cerebral vascular accident begins with a general neurological examination, used to identify specific areas of resulting injury. A CT scan of the brain is then used to identify any cerebral hemorrhaging. An MRI with special sequences called diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), is very sensitive for locating areas of an ischemic based stroke, such as a watershed stroke. Further diagnosis and evaluation of a stroke includes evaluation of the blood vessels in the neck using either Doppler ultrasound, MR-angiography or CT-angiography, or formal angiography. An echocardiogram may be performed looking for a cardiac source of emboli. Blood tests for risk factors also may be ordered, including cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, homocysteine levels, and blood coagulation tests. =Classification systems= *The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the patient's initial symptoms. Based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis. Later publications distinguish between \\"syndrome\\" and \\"infarct\\", based on evidence from imaging. \\"Syndrome\\" may be replaced by \\"hemorrhage\\" if imaging demonstrates a bleed. See * The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations. In this diagnostic system, a stroke is classified as being due to # Thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery # Embolism of cardiac origin # Occlusion of a small blood vessel Treatment =Carotid endarterectomy= Often considered one of the safest ways to treat symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is a procedure by which a surgeon gently removes atherosclerotic plaque. Blood flow hopefully then returns to normal, increasing oxygen concentration to normal amounts in watershed areas of the brain. There is the potential for complications, including disturbing portions of the plaque leading to a stroke or heart attack during or after surgery. Small risks of bleeding and infection exist as well. =Percutaneous treatments of carotid stenosis= In this type of procedure, a narrowed blood vessel is expanded via angioplasty or stenting. A thin angiography catheter is inserted in a large groin blood vessel and advanced to the stenosis. Percutaneous treatment is less invasive than endarterectomy, usually requiring only local anesthesia. Endarterectomy is still considered safer though, as percutaneous treatments can lead to accidental dislodging of plaque or even arterial rupturing. Carotid angioplasty During carotid angioplasty, an angiography cather with a small deflated balloon attached on the tip is advanced to a carotid stenosis. The ballon is then inflated slowly, forcing the narrowed portion of the vessel to expand. Carotid stenting Carotid stenting follows a similar procedure. Rather than using a balloon, a stent (metal mesh-like tube) is placed over the atherosclerotic plaque in the hopes of stabilizing it and allowing for increased blood flow to watershed portions of the brain. Prognosis Watershed strokes are seldom fatal, but they can lead to neuromuscular degeneration, as well as dementia. This degeneration at the watershed regions of the brain can lead to difficulties with movement and motor coordination, as well as speech. Long-term care is focused around three areas: rehabilitative therapy, surgical interventions, and prevention of future watershed strokes. =Rehabilitative therapies= Long-term rehabilitative therapy for watershed stroke patients involves physical, occupational, and speech and language therapies. Physical therapy can be used to enhance motor function in the legs and arms that has been impacted by stroke. Occupational therapies can be provided to help to alleviate cognitive impairments that result from watershed stroke, as well as to improve fine motor function that was damaged as a result of the stroke. Stroke can also cause impairments in speech production secondary to neurocognitive and neuromuscular impairments, and therefore speech and language therapies are often a component of long-term care for stroke patients. Intensive speech and language therapy has been shown to improve speech deficits associated with aphasia resulting from stroke. =Surgical interventions= Endovascular interventions, including surgical revascularization, can increase blood flow in the area of the stroke, thereby decreasing the likelihood that insufficient blood flow to the watershed regions of the brain will result in subsequent strokes. Neuroscientists are currently researching stem cell transplantation therapies to improve recovery of cebreral tissue in affected areas of the brain post-stroke. Should this intervention be proven effective, it will greatly increase the number of neurons in the brain that can recover from a stroke. =Prevention of future strokes= There are several interventions that are often used to help prevent the recurrence of a watershed stroke; namely, nutritional interventions, as well as antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and statin drug use. Nutritional interventions, including increased consumption of certain amino acids, antioxidants, B-group vitamins, and zinc, have been shown to increase the recovery of neurocognitive function after a stroke. Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, as well as anticoagulants, are used to help prevent blood clots and therefore embolisms, which can cause watershed strokes. Statin drugs are also used to control hyperlipidemia, another risk factor for watershed stroke. Research =Stem cell transplantation= Ischemic stroke is still a major health concern and studies are being conducted to determine the pathway in which brain damage occurs to identify targets for intervention. Stem cell transplantation may help in intervention to improve cell recovery and regeneration. =Strokes after cardiac surgery= Although the mechanism is not entirely understood, the likelihood of a watershed stroke increases after cardiac surgery. An experiment conducted in a five-year span studied the diagnosis, etiology, and outcome of these postoperative strokes. It was observed that intraoperative decrease in blood pressure may lead to these strokes and patients who have undergone aortic procedures are more likely to have bilateral watershed infarcts. Furthermore, bilateral watershed strokes are associated with poor short-term outcomes and are most reliably observed by diffusion-weighted imaging MRI. Thus future clinical research and practice should focus on the identification of bilateral stroke characteristics. This identification can help discover affected areas and increase correct diagnosis. =Deep watershed infarcts= Hemodynamic impairment is thought to be the cause of deep watershed infarcts, characterized by a rosary-like pattern. However new studies have shown that microembolism might also contribute to the development of deep watershed infarcts. The dual contribution of hemodynamic impairment and microembolism would result in different treatment for patients with these specific infarcts. =Basilar artery (BA) stenting= While intracranial artery stenting is used for same side stroke prevention, basilar artery stenting may help to improve parallel, accessory blood flow. The stent may also lead to termination of recurrent middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes. =Penumbra imaging= The area around the damaged ischemia is known as the penumbra. This viable area has the ability to regenerate with the help of pharmacological treatment however most patients with penumbra are left untreated. New research is being conducted in metabolic suppression, direct energy delivery, and selective drug delivery to help salvage this area of the brain after a stroke. CLEVSRKNC peptide This new drug has been shown to home to ischemic stroke tissue as well as apoptotic neuronal cells of the penumbra region. This discovery may help in creating selective drug delivery for stroke patients. Liposomal drug delivery Nanoliposomes are currently being researched for specific drug delivery due to their ph-sensitive and high blood‚Äìbrain barrier diffusion characteristics. Many advantages of these drugs include: #Drugs can be maintained in the active state while encapsulated. #Being encapsulated provides direct access to target tissue #Prevention of non-specific binding #Allows for a high concentration of drug Due to the fact that acidic environment and low blood flow are prominent characteristic of the penumbra area, liposomal drugs seem to be well suited. Terminology Watershed strokes are named because they affect the distal watershed areas of the brain. The original terminology came from the German literature, which used the analogy of an irrigation system. The German scholars compared the blood flow in distal arterial territories of the brain to the last field on a farm, which was the area with the least supply of water and therefore most vulnerable to any reduction in flow. In a medical context, the term \\"watershed\\" refers to those areas of the brain that receive dual blood supply from the branching ends of two large arteries.
