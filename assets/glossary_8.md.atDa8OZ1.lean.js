Charles Harward son of John Harward and Lucy Harward (maiden name Sanford) was born on 1 August and baptised 28 August 1723 and died 15 July 1802, he was an Anglican priest, born in Hayne House Plymtree, Devon. Family Charles Harward married Ann Ball (1738–1785) on 24 March 1763 at Saint Martins in the Fields. Westminster, London. She was the daughter of Thomas Ball (1698–1770) Dean of Chichester Cathedral and his wife Margaret (maiden name Mill (1712–1783). Charles and Ann had a daughter Elisabeth Margaret Harward (1764–1796), who married the Rev. William Blake (1763–1812) the Rector of Braunton, Devon. They had three other children as follows: Ann Augusta Harward (1765–1847), Charles Harward (1766–1816) and John Harward (1767–1791). After Ann died, Charles on 16 November 1785 married Louisa Yonge (1730–1811) who was the daughter of Sir William Yonge 4th Baronet of Escot (1693–1755) the Whig MP for Honiton and his wife Anne Howard Education Harward matriculated from school in 1742, he then went on to study at Clare College, Cambridge where he was awarded a B.A. in 1745/46 this was followed by his M.A. in 1755.Venn. (online ed.) Career From 1755 to 1762 Harward was Rector of Whiston with moiety of Denton, Northamptonshire. In 1770 he was appointed Dean of Chichester.Hennessy. Chichester Diocese Clergy List. p. 2 One of Chichester's residents, at the time of Harward, was John Marsh a gentleman, composer, diarist and writer.Brandon Sussex p. 224 He recorded some pretty uncomplimentary details about Harward in his diary suggesting that 'Dean Howard was as little of a gentleman as he was a divine'.Marsh. The John Marsh Journals. p. 451 He also said that: > ... Dr Harward, a man much fitter to be at the head of a regiment than of a > Chapter; being a very headstrong, passionate man and much given to swearing, > dealing out his oaths to the vergers whenever he had the least cause of > complaint. He was also a very litigious man, and was remarkably irreverent > in his behaviour in church, frequently talking during the lesson ...Robert > Holby. The Restoration in Hobbs. Chichester Cathedral. p. 112. Fig 48 During Harward's time at Chichester one of the chapter, a Dr. Hurdis, died in early 1784.Horsfield. History. pp. 26–28 It was the dean and the remaining members of the chapters responsibility to find a replacement. Consequently, a meeting was held on 1 August 1784 by the dean and the other three members of the chapter to elect a new member to replace the late Dr Hurdis Harward and one of the members of the chapter, a Rev. William Webber, voted for a Rev. John Buckner; the other members of the chapter, the Rev. Combe Miller and Rev. John Courtail voted for the Rev. George Metcalf. It was not accepted that Harward had a casting vote so a stalemate ensued. There followed several more meetings to try and resolve the issue but to no avail, so Miller and Courtail petitioned the bishop to settle the matter. The bishop arranged for Dean Harward and the chapter to appear before him on 12 January 1785 to explain why they had not appointed a new member of the chapter, and as they had not why the bishop should not appoint someone himself. At the hearing the bishop was not persuaded by their arguments so appointed George Metcalf. The dean and Webber refused to accept this decision, but the bishop demanded that they accept his candidate on pain of excommunication. However this was not the end of the matter as the dean and Webber took out a court order restraining the bishop from proceeding.Durnford. Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Court of King's Bench; p. 650. The case was eventually heard by the Court of Kings Bench on 27 April 1787. The court agreed with the dean and Webber's argument and found that it was not in the bishop's power to appoint people over the dean and chapter. The court issued a mandamus to compel the dean and chapter to fill the vacancy, and on such a mandamus the court said that it \\"will compel an election at the peril of those who refuse.\\"Durnford. Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Court of King's Bench; p. 800. It seems that despite all, the bishop's candidate George Metcalf remained in post. Harward resigned as dean of Chichester in 1790.Recorded in The Gazette (London Gazette), issue 13213, 26 June 1790. p. 397 He was elected Dean of Exeter on 16 July 1790, and confirmed 13 August 1790.Oliver. Lives of the Bishops of Exeter p. 277 His appointment as Dean of Exeter allowed him to return to Hayne House, the family seat, in Plymtree, Devon.Lysons. Parishes: Plympton St Maurice - Pyworthy. pp. 408–425 In Plymtree while living at Hayne House he added the family coat of arms with the motto \\"Crux Vincit Mundum\\" (the cross wins the world), above the front door. The Arms consist of a silver cross, each arm of which also forms a cross, with a blue ring in the centre of each crossing and in the centre, and four teardrops surrounding it all on a red ground. The original motto was 'Nec Cupias Nec Metua' meaning ' Neither Desire or Fear'. Dean Charles Harward was keen farmer and also a sporting parson; but much of his time was spent at the Court of King George III, where he acted as Chaplain to Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Princess of Wales, and tutor to the children of many important courtiers. He was a large drinker, with a particular taste for the excellent local cider. In the 'Pound House' he had a cider press and 'apple engine' and five vats to receive the brew; the pound chamber cellar held eight large butts, eight cider pipes and 34 hogsheads for storing cider, plus other barrels for the beer which was made in his fully equipped brew house. It was said that the Dean exercised discipline in the Cathedral with a beady eye - 'and by judicious spitting at any choirboy who fell asleep during his services'. He left some of his property to his daughter Elizabeth's son Rev Charles Blake, who had to change his surname to Harward in 1816 in order to inherit. He died at Hayne House, on 15 July 1802, age 79.

It was founded in 1996 and was run independently until 2007 when it was sold to Name Media, after which it was sold to Geeknet, and then finally to its current owner, Ziff Davis. History The original logo for Geek.com. Geek.com was founded in 1996 by Joel Evans and Rob Hughes. Joel's brother, Sam Evans, was soon added as the site's chief editor. The site was founded as the Ugeek newsletter but soon become a larger online portal with multiple different sections, including JobGeek, GameGeek, PDAGeek, and ChipGeek. Among the site's many early successes was Ugeek.com's popular Processor Archive. In March 2007 Geek.com was sold to NameMedia, a company that specializes in domain name reselling and parking. NameMedia had recently acquired Philip Greenspun's photo.net and was building out its Enthusiast Media Network, where Geek.com would be the lead technology site. After the acquisition Rob Hughes and Sam Evans left the site, though co-founder Joel Evans stayed on in his role as Chief Geek. Soon afterwards the site's mobile analyst Matthew \\"palmsolo\\" Miller left the site and started writing at ZDnet's Mobile Gadgeteer blog. In mid-2007 Geek.com underwent a major redesign, moving away from the platform that it had used since 2001, and did away with the subportals, like PDAgeek. In August 2007 NameMedia acquired XYZcomputing.com a computer hardware website and hired its founder, Sal Cangeloso, to be the site's Senior Editor. In May 2010 NameMedia sold Geek.com to Geeknet for $1 million. Cangeloso, who had been promoted to Editor-in-Chief when Joel Evans left at the close of 2009 stayed on board in the same position. The troubled Geeknet sold Geek.com to Ziff Davis at the beginning of January 2011 for an undisclosed amount. Once again Cangeloso stayed on, as did longstanding News Editor, Matthew Humphries. In 2016, Geek.com was significantly retooled under a new staff, consisting of Editor-in-Chief Chris Radtke, Managing Editor Sheilah Villari, and Senior Editor Jordan Minor. Along with a visual redesign, the site expanded its focus to broader geek culture topics like technology, gaming, movies, TV, and comic books. A new team of freelancers was brought on board to carry out this vision, including YouTube film critic Bob \\"MovieBob\\" Chipman. At the end of 2016 the site hosted a five-hour Facebook \\"Gifted and Talented Show\\" made up of sketches and holiday gift suggestions. One notable article, an explanation on the lies surrounding the cartoon Street Sharks, went viral on sites like Vox, The A.V. Club, and Gawker.

Club career Having passed through the ranks of the Hajduk Split youth academy, Bencun was loaned in the summer of 2011 to the Treća HNL Jug side NK Primorac 1929 and after a great half-season in Primorac, he was subsequently recalled to the Hajduk first team by coach Krasimir Balakov in January 2012. Because of a very big competition in the Hajduk's front line, with the likes of Ante Vukušić and Ivan Vuković who had great season, Bencun was sent on half-year loan again in February, this time to NK Dugopolje in Druga HNL. In Dugopolje, he had a great start where he scored 4 times in only six appearances, but in April he suffered serious ligaments injury in training, which kept him out for the rest of the season. He had a very good first part of the 2012-2013 season at Hajduk, scoring 9 times in 14 appearances, but again, after a row with Hajduk coach, Stanko Poklepović, Bencun was loaned in February 2013 to its feeder club, NK Primorac 1929 again. He was again very prolific, scored 5 goals in 6 matches, and returned to Hajduk after the season ended. Since Stanko Poklepović was no longer coach, he had made himself a starter again under coach Igor Tudor, and the season 2013-14 was his best. He scored 12 times in the 1. HNL, including a brace in \\"Eternal derby\\" against Dinamo Zagreb. After the season ended, there were multiple enquiries from European clubs, including FC Midtjylland, AS Saint-Ettiene and Sochaux, but Hajduk refused to let him go for less than 2.5 million euros. Eventually, he was loaned to FC Brasov for 500,000 € with an option to purchase him at the end of the season for a further 2,2 million Euro. In Brasov, he scored 5 goals in 11 championship matches and 2 goals in the cup competition, but again, because of his problematic behaviour, he got in an argument with teammates and returned to Hajduk in January, 2015. In 1. HNL, he scored 8 times in 10 matches, and again attracted interest from various football clubs. Hajduk Split set a price of €2,000,000 for young forward.

Considering European labour law cases and the purpose of discrimination legislation, it held that it was legitimate to select a person of a particular religion to be an arbitrator, here an Ismaili. Facts Jivraj and Hashwani started a property investment joint venture in 1981, with a term that disputes should go to three arbitrators, one appointed by each, and all from the Ismaili community. In 1988 it was terminated, and some assets divided. In 2008, Hashwani’s solicitors wrote claiming more payment and requesting an arbitrator, but identifying a preferred non-Ismaili arbitrator. Jivraj said this was invalid, but Hashwani argued that the Ismaili requirement was contrary to EERBR 2003 r 6(1) and Directive 2000/78/EC art 3. The Judge held EERBR 2003 did not apply to arbitrators, but even if it did, it would be a genuine occupational requirement under EERBR 2003 r 7. The Court of Appeal, Moore-Bick LJ for Aikens LJ and Buxton LJ, held an arbitrator appointment was a contract for provision of services, and ‘a contract personally to do any work’ which satisfied the definition of ‘employment in EERBR 2003 r 2(3), and that a party appointing an arbitrator was an ‘employer’ under r 6(1). Thus, restricting to Ismaili’s was contrary to r 6(1)(a)(c) and the exception in r 7 did not apply because being Ismaili was unnecessary for discharging an arbitrator’s functions. Because this would make the whole agreement substantially different the arbitration clause as a whole was void under EERBR 2003 Sch 4, para 1(1). Laurence Rabinowitz QC, Christopher Style QC and Christopher McCrudden intervened for the London Court of International Arbitration. Thomas Linden QC, Toby Landau QC, Paul Key and David Craig intervened for the International Chamber of Commerce. Rabinder Singh QC and Aileen McColgan intervened with written submissions for the His Highness Prince Aga Khan Shia Imami Ismaili International Conciliation and Arbitration Board. Judgment Lord Clarke held that an arbitrator’s position could not fall under the EERBR 2003 (now the EA 2010 s 13) because it had to be construed in light of the aim of Directive 2000/78, and the jurisprudence of the ECJ. This drew a clear distinction, beyond the requirement of work for a wage in Lawrie-Blum, between those in a subordinate position, as in Allonby, and independent providers of services. An arbitrator was not subordinate, and not even a contract personally to do work. No part of the agreement was invalid. Percy v Board of National Mission of the Church of Scotland [2006] 2 AC 28, HL(Sc) and the opinion of AG Maduro from Centrum voor Gelijkheid van Kansen en voor Racismebestrijding v Firma Feryn NV (Case C-54/07) [2008] ICR 1390 was considered . If the regulations had been applicable, though, they would have fallen under r 7(3) as a genuine occupational requirement because an Ismaili requirement was indeed genuine and also justifiable. Lord Phillips, Lord Walker and Lord Dyson concurred. Lord Mance agreed that an arbitrator would fall outside the Regulations, but did not agree that the exception would be justified if the point arose.

Pegasus Press (2001), pp. 618–625. John Gualbert was an Italian Roman Catholic saint, the founder of the Vallumbrosan Order. He was a member of the Visdomini family of Florentine nobility. One Good Friday he was entering Florence accompanied by armed followers, when in a narrow lane he came upon a man who had killed his brother. He was about to kill the man in revenge, when the other fell upon his knees with arms outstretched in the form of a cross and begged for mercy in the name of Christ, who had been crucified on that day. John forgave him. He entered the Benedictine Church at San Miniato to pray, and the figure on the crucifix bowed its head to him in recognition of his generosity. John Gualbert was later canonised. This arguably being Burne- Jones's most important early work,In the memorial biography of her husband, Georgiana Burne-Jones stated that it seemed: 'to sum up and seal the ten years that had passed since Edward first went to Oxford'. Cf. information at BM&AG; website it demonstrates a new and more personal style, evident in its design, technique and expression. It remained Burne-Jones's own favourite among his early works: this interest in knights and chivalry was aroused when painting the Arthurian Oxford Union murals in 1863 and was to remain with him throughout his life. In 1894 he tried to borrow The Merciful Knight to make a large oil version, and he was actually working on The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon when he died in 1898.The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in Puerto Rico. However, it was shown for a short time at the Tate Britain in London while the Ponce Museum underwent restoration in 2009–2010.

Knab was born September 22, 1865, in Würzburg, Bavaria and came to the United States as a boy of eight with his parents, Oscar and Josephine Knab, who settled in Chicopee, Massachusetts in 1873. His father was an engraver and painter and an uncle was court painter to the King of Bavaria. In his youth, Knab showed artistic talent and a strong interest in the natural sciences, especially entomology. He studied the classic works of Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Henry Walter Bates and accumulated a large collection of insects, particularly beetles (Order Coleoptera), and became an active member of the Springfield (Massachusetts) Zoological Club and an active correspondent with other coleopterists. In 1885, Knab undertook a sixteen month collecting trip up the Amazon River, traveling from its mouth to Peru. He kept a journal of his expedition, which formed an important source of experience for his later scientific career. In 1889, he went to Europe and studied art for two years at the Munich Academy, and then established a studio in Chicopee with the intention of making landscape painting his profession. In 1903 the Carnegie Institution of Washington provided a grant to United States Department of Agriculture entomologist Leland Ossian Howard to develop a monograph of the mosquitoes of North and Central America and the West Indies. In organizing the work Howard sought the advice of entomologist George Dimmock of Springfield as to the best observer known to him who could undertake the study of the biology of the mosquitoes of the New England region, and Dimmock nominated Knab. Knab's work produced important notes and a report illustrated by drawings which were so excellent that State Entomologist of Illinois Stephen Alfred Forbes subsequently hired Knab as a scientific illustrator, giving his abilities wider exposure. In 1906 Knab accepted a position with the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., and became co-author of the Carnegie Institution-sponsored monograph on mosquitoes in collaboration with Leland Ossian Howard and Harrison Gray Dyar, Jr. He became an active member of the Biological Society of Washington, served as Vice-President of the Entomological Society of Washington, and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Entomological Society of America. He began working on a Doctor of Philosophy degree at George Washington University, but the final stages of his illness prevented him from completing the requirements before his death. Knab died in Washington, D.C. on November 2, 1918, after a long and painful battle with Leishmaniasis contracted during his expedition to Brazil in 1885–1886, which he himself diagnosed through study of the South American medical literature. A bibliography of his published works was provided as an addendum to a memorial authored by three of his closest colleagues, Andrew Nelson Caudell, August Busck, and Leland Ossian Howard published in 1919.

A Hispano-Moresque pattern on 4 tiles. Malibu tile is a type of ceramic tile that takes its inspiration from the tiles that were produced at Malibu Potteries in Malibu, California, during the latter half of the 1920s. These tiles reflect a style of design that is referred to as Hispano-Moresque or Arabesque exhibiting bright contrasting glaze colors often in geometric patterns that are reminiscent of tiles produced many centuries ago in the Near and Middle East, North Africa and southern Spain. The Adamson House in Malibu, California, now the Malibu Lagoon Museum, contains the largest and most varied display of Malibu Potteries tile. The Adamson House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and became a California Historical Landmark in 1985. This type of tile was introduced to the American public in San Diego at the Panama California Exposition in 1915 as it adorned the Santa Fe Railroad Depot and what is now the San Diego Museum of Man. These tiles were produced by California China Products Company in National City and were designed by architectural firms in San Francisco and New York City, respectively. The aesthetic represented by these tiles had an immediate appeal to architects and homeowners as they blended beautifully into the increasing popular Spanish Colonial Revival architecture that had also been introduced at the exposition.  History  A severe fire at the Malibu Potteries in 1931 led to the closure of the pottery the following year after only six years of production. Several of the tile makers found jobs at other tile companies in the Los Angeles area, some of which were making similar products. But the Great Depression curtailed construction and diminished the need and desire for decorative tiles. By the time the United States became engaged in World War II, almost all of the remaining tile works had either closed or shifted to producing products that supported the war effort. Another fire, this one a major wild fire in September 1970, swept through Malibu Canyon exposing in its aftermath a massive stash of Malibu Potteries tile heretofore unknown except to the heirs of the Potteries’ owners. Although unnoticed for several years, the vast majority of the tiles were unscathed by the fire. By the mid-70s rumors aroused interest in this unique collection and tiles began appearing in both publicly viewable installations and in private collections. Robert (Bob) Harris, a sound technician in the movie industry, found himself irresistibly attracted by the incomparable aesthetic qualities of the tiles and purchased a large collection. = Malibu Ceramic Works = Malibu Ceramic Works; Matt, Roz and Bob Harris. In 1979, using his collection of original tile from Malibu Potteries as inspiration, Harris founded Malibu Ceramic Works in Topanga Canyon and began the slow process of reverse engineering all of the steps in re-producing Malibu tile. The original tiles provided models of what made them popular: the sizes, the patterns and, maybe above all else, the glaze colors and their application. His goal was to reproduce a product comparable to the tiles produced at Malibu Potteries. Within a year of the founding of this fledgling enterprise nestled precariously along Topanga Creek, an event took place in downtown Los Angeles that had a major impact on the public’s awareness of Malibu Potteries and its splendid array of ceramic products. A fellow collector, David Greenberg, another beneficiary of the stash of tiles left exposed following the fire of 1970, mounted an exhibition of his collection at the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, which opened in June 1980 accompanied by a colorful catalog of objects. The impact on the development and success of Malibu Ceramic Works cannot be underestimated. In time, Harris was able to replicate nearly all of the many ceramic tile and related products of Malibu Potteries by developing processes and techniques, some advantaged by modern technology, while others still relying on old- fashioned artisan methods. Many companies currently producing Malibu style tile use the methods and techniques that Harris recreated.  Original patterns  In the case of the 'Green Man' or 'Eternal Man' on display at the Adamson House in Malibu, a replica was created by making a mold from the original Green Man fountain, including a fully functional water spout. That clay mold is still used to make green man fountains. Many 21st century artisans have also recreated variations on one of the most popular murals, the 'Peacock' fountain that is found in the rear courtyard of the Adamson House. Despite exposure to the elements, these early 20th century tiles still much of their original color and aesthetic features. Production = Clay production= Shows cart-loading kilns for bulk firing The first step in producing ceramic tile is making the clay body on which patterns of glazes can be applied and then heated to a high temperature in a kiln. In the Spanish Revival tradition, dark red is the standard clay, although Malibu Potteries did create buff clay bodies on occasion. Ultimately Harris purchased a tile manufacturing plant in Long Beach, California which would produce the smaller “deco” tile as well as the traditional red floor tile which is one hallmark of Malibu style tile. Malibu Potteries produced a wide array of floor tile, in a variety of shapes and patterns, including hexagon and octagon that were installed in geometric patterns, ranging from simple to complex. Geometric patterns were typical of the original Saracen and Spanish floors as illustrated by the picture of a patio at the Adamson House and detailed in multiple vicissitudes in the Malibu Potteries Catalog. Malibu Ceramic Works floor tiles are comparable to those of Malibu Potteries since both achieve a high level of hardness that is needed when used for purposes of public foot traffic, back splashes, stair risers, and other daily use functions. These floor tiles can be contrasted with common floor tiles used in Southern California, which are known as Mexican pavers, but which do not have the same dark red tones and would seem to be lacking in the same degree of strength and durability. =Extruding clay= Tile Extrusion machine Another way to make key elements of ceramic tile in the Spanish Revival tradition is through the process of extrusion. Unfired clay, usually dark red clay in the Spanish Revival tradition, is pushed under high pressure through a die or mold that extrudes a certain shape. After the pieces are extruded, they either glazed and fired or just fired, thereby retaining their dark red color. As illustrated in the original Malibu Potteries catalog, such shapes included quarter rounds and bullnose, and other shapes that finished the edge of tiles or enabled the tile to change directions, as can be seen in the pictures below of the bench and in the Star fountain. Contemporary ceramicists can replicate the original extruded pieces using modern machinery such as a Western Claymachinery, model SE10 extruding machine. =Silk screening= Silk screen set up to apply resist material Malibu Potteries was an early adopter of one method to apply the black line resist to tiles: silk screening. The technology of silk screening advanced substantially by the late 20th Century, making the process of replicating Malibu tile more consistent compared to hand painting each tile. Silk screens are created by printing a black outline on a sheet of clear acetate, such as with an ink jet printer, then burning the image onto a frame holding a polyester sheet on which a plastic-like emulsion has been applied. Exposing the emulsion to light causes the emulsion to dry or “fix,” while the emulsion directly underneath the black lines on the acetate remain soft and unfixed. When the silk screen is “washed out” by a hose, or even power-washed, the emulsion directly under the black outline of the image is vacated, leaving a porous outline. The black line, semi-liquid can now be pushed, usually with a squeegee, through the porous outline onto a piece of tile. Good silk screens are extremely useful in that, once created, the pattern can be applied repeatedly to many tiles, of course, even changing the colors for any given project. =Black line resist= Pattern is applied to a bisque tile by pushing black line through silkscreen Malibu Potteries relied extensively on hand painted artwork and the hands-on technique of painting tile with brushes. Today artisans have at their disposal many tools that improve upon the process of creating the image on the tile. One of the most useful is the creation and editing made possible in software programs, such as Adobe Photoshop.With such graphics programs one can develop black and white outlines that constitute the art work of the cuerda seca style of tile. In the cuerda seca, or 'dry line' technique as it is also known, an outline of a pattern is created on a tile with the wet ceramic glazes being applied with drip bottles, such as an ear dropper for infants. The black line creates a barrier or \\"resist,\\" keeping the glazes inside the lines and, when the tile is fired, the black lines also form an attractive outline of the pattern. The exact composition of the black line ingredients is somewhat of an industry secret, in general, yet also variable among the current, practicing artisans. As reported in various sources, Malibu Potteries used \\"a finely pulverized manganese oxide mixed with a medium viscosity mineral oil\\". Today many companies offer a variety of water-based and oil-based products which they state will form a resist barrier for glazes. Large companies, such as Axner, Laguna, Aftosa and Duncan, all offer various products that can be used in creating a resist line for cuerda seca style tile. A recent Masters thesis empirically compares several off-the-shelf products with variations of the original formula. =Making glazes= One of the most evident characteristics of original Malibu Potteries' tile is the bright and vibrant colors that were used. Rufus Keller, who tested and created the ceramic glazes, is known to have kept the formulas for these glazes in a personal note book which was recorded in his own code.Making glazes involves mixing a dry base glaze with stains (colors) and water At Malibu Potteries, the glazes were mixed in an 'off-limits' room that was known as the \\"holy of holies\\". A lot more was known about making ceramic glazes when contemporaries attempted to replicate the hundreds of colors and finishes that were created by Rufus Keeler. Nonetheless, modern ceramicists have re-created the bright and vibrant colors often used in Malibu tile such as bright orange, deep red, lush greens, yellows, and cobalt blue. Even with modern advantages, creating custom colors and finishes requires a good deal of testing, especially when one must consider the chemical interaction between the clay body and the ceramic glaze. Just as Malibu Potteries offered a wide a wide array of glazes where the surface might be glossy, matte, or crackled, contemporary ceramicists have successfully reverse engineered virtually all of the glazes originally produced by Malibu Potteries, and then some. Some illustrations of these types of glazes are seen in the pictures that follow. = Application of glazes= Application of glazes virtually unchanged since 1930 Just as early photographs show workers at Malibu Potteries, usually women, applying glazes to bisque tile having resist patterns, modern ceramicists rely upon virtually the same technique. Tile with resist lines circulate on a Lazy Susan while 'glazers' use bulb syringes to squeeze the wet glaze onto the tile. Since unfired glaze does not necessarily look the same color as a fired glaze, a schematic is usually close by to identify where the appropriate glaze goes on the tile. Glazers with steady hands and a good attention span produce tiles with consistent edges and infrequent run-over. = Kiln firing = Firing room with multiple kilns Loaded kiln after firing Malibu Potteries built its factory on an idyllic location, right next to the Malibu pier on the sandy beach. To be able to produce large quantities of tile, Malibu Potteries created an immense kiln which was run on diesel fuel. Their firing process required extensive use of fuel because they fired their tile at 1900° which took 24 hours and which required another full day to cool down With today's technology, there are a wide array of kilns available, especially electric kilns, that can be operated more efficiently and provide greater control. The modern-day kiln uses a computer-like controller that makes the firing progress more predictable and controllable than in years' past. The user sets such variables as ramp rate to achieve the final, desired temperature and holds, where the temperature is held for period of time, as well as, the overall time of the firing. With programs built into most controllers, modern kilns do not require much actual knowledge of how a kiln operates, nor do they require much monitoring. While Malibu Potteries tile was fired to a very high temperature over a long period of time, today's tile tends to be fired at lower temperatures for a shorter period of time. Temperatures typically range from cone 06 (1816°) to cone 10 (2345°). Cone 06 tile is less hard or dense so is generally less resistant to such things as water and freezing, while cone 10 tile reach vitrification and are known to be extremely strong and suitable for applications everywhere, including floors, showers and kitchens. Tile at the entrance to the Adamson House, for example, have been exposed to a west-facing sun, salty air on the beach since 1930, and they still retain a high level of brilliance and structural integrity.  Installations  Malibu style tile are installed in a variety of places but are easily recognizable to anyone with a basic knowledge of them. The basic tile, a “deco” for decorative, is square 4\\" by 4\\" or 6\\" by 6.\\" These tiles are often installed on archways, entries, towers, balconies, loggias, and fountains creating a \\"Mediterranean ambiance\\". Another style of tile is the linear tile where the pattern continues to its left and to its right, as one might find on a border for the floor or on top row of a wainscot. The poppy tiles illustrate a common difference in the technique for keeping the glazed colors separate from one another: the cuerda seca technique versus the cuenca or tub tile technique where there is a raised pattern stamped into the tile when it is still wet. The raised pattern serves as a physical barrier to hold the glaze in place as opposed to the black line resist which is typically held in place by the chemical reaction between oil and water. =Benches = Another application for Malibu tile is on a bench. Malibu tile are ideal because the surface is both durable and typically smooth which means that the tile can be used to create benches in a variety of settings, public and private indoors and out doors. =Fountains= Fountains are another application of Malibu tile. These fountains have been done in a variety of shapes, such as, the \\"star-fountain\\" at the Adamson House. Malibu tile distinguish themselves not only by their customary bright colors and patterns but also by being incredibly strong, resisting the weather or constant flow of water. =Murals= Another application of Malibu tile is found in murals. Malibu Potteries created a variety of installations, from the peacock fountain to art that clearly reflected on the early Spanish settlers, such as Spanish galleons and flamenco dancers. Designs ranged from representational figures to stylized patterns such as the Spanish galleon at sunset. That mural is a reproduction of a mural that is currently installed at the Serra Retreat, which was damaged from the fire that leveled much of the retreat and ruined a horde of Malibu Potteries' tile that May Rindge had stored there. = Gallery = File:Spanish galleon replica mural, comparable to installation at the Serra Retreat, Malibu, CA.jpgReproduction of Spanish Galleon File:Star fountain in a garden that appears in the digital catalog for Malibu Ceramic Works.jpgContemporary star-fountain illustrating Islamic influence File:Bench in garden at Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara, CA.jpgContemporary use of Malibu style tile with red brick File:Mixed patio tile at the Adamson House in Malibu, CA.jpgExternal Patio, Adamson House File:Floor tile at MCW mixing red terra cotta and small decorative tile.jpgContemporary use of terra cotta and decorative tile File:Multiple pattern in floor tile at Malibu Ceramic Works.jpgContemporary use of mixed patterns of floor tile  References  = Cited works =   Further reading  * Gellner, Arrol and Douglas Keister, Red Tile Style: America's Spanish Revival Architecture, Penguin Group, New York, NY (2002) * McMillian, Elizabeth, Casa California: Spanish Style Houses from Santa Barbara to San Clemente, Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., New York, NY (1996) * McMillian, Elizabeth, California Colonial: The Spanish and Rancho Revival Styles, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Atglen, PA (2002) * Waldie, D.J. and Diane Keaton, California Romantica, Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., New York, NY (2002)  External links  * Malibu Ceramic Works Category:California culture Category:Malibu, California Category:History of Los Angeles County, California Category:Tiling ","title":"Malibu tile"},{"id":"34537021","text":"Peabody City Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2012, and the sixth NRHP listing in Peabody, Kansas, United States.Recent nominees for National Register of Historic Places; The Wichita Eagle; December 6, 2011.NRHP Property Weekly List Changes; National Park Service (NPS); January 20, 2012. The park is approximately 3 blocks by 2 blocks in size and located in southwest Peabody. History In 1875, the first agricultural \\"county fair\\" was held at the current park location. It was held annually for many years by the Marion County Agricultural Society.Poster from Seventh Annual Agriculture Fair At Peabody From September 28-30, 1881 In 1881, the Fair Floral Exhibition Hall was built, west of the football field at the top of the hill. The building is unique because of its octagon walls. It is the only remaining fair building and not open to the public. In September 1885, the Kansas State Fair was held at Peabody during the first four days of the month. An outstanding feature of the state fair was \\"the First Monument to General Grant\\", who died shortly before the fair. The temporary monument was an obelisk about tall, and built from forty bushels of ears of corn. The fair had a grandstand, which could hold 2000 people, to view horse races. The race track was used for a variety of events, including horse walking teams in harness, trotting, running, pacing, mule racing, and daily chariot races. A dining hall was built that was capable of feeding 10,000 people each day. Peabody was the home of famous race horses around the turn of the century. Three of the more famous horses were world champions. Joe Young (known as the \\"iron horse\\") sold for $10,000 by C.E. Westbrook, the first horse west of the Mississippi River to sell for such a high price. Joe Young sired Joe Patchen in 1889, who earned his owner $40,000 in race purses and then was sold for $44,000. Joe Patchen sired Dan Patch in 1896, a horse that sold in 1907 for $60,000. Other famous local racing horses included trotters McKinney, and Silver Sign. Silverthorne toured Austria where he competed for three years against the best race horses in Europe. In 1900, the Marion County Agricultural Society sold the fair grounds to the city of Peabody, which renamed it the Peabody City Park.Peabody - The First 100 Years; Peabody Gazette-Herald; June 1971. In 1938, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built the football stadium limestone bleachers, west and north walls, picnic tables, fire pits, and various items in the park. In 1950 through 1960, the high school boys baseball (Class B) state tournaments were held at the baseball diamond.Winners & Records Of All KSHSAA-Sponsored State Events In 1960s and 1970s, up to 30,000 or more people attended the Independence Day Celebration on July 4 at the park, including a Carnival of rides.Peabody City Park History; lasr.net In November 1977, the high school boys football (Class 2A) state final was held at the park. Beloit took 1st place and Peabody took 2nd Place. It is also notable because the Peabody head coach was Dennis Franchione. In July 2011, will mark the 90th year of fireworks at the park. The fireworks are infamous for the ending display named Battle of New Orleans, which explodes over 1 Million individual items.July 4th Battle Of New Orleans on July 2010 - YouTube VideoJuly 4th Regional TV Commercial - YouTube VideoJuly 4th Celebration webpage; City of Peabody. In January 2012, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Current The park has a playground equipment area. There are picnic tables and shelters located throughout the park. It is open to the public as weather permits. It has the following sports facilities: * Football field. The Peabody-Burns High School football team plays their home games here each fall. * Baseball field. Open year around as weather permits. * Outdoor swimming pool.

A common opening move for White is to move the line of two men at c2 and d1 to b3 and c2. This is executed by moving the checker at the back of the line to the front: 1. d1b3'. Less common opening moves are 1. d1d4 and '. Of course, it does not have to be the last man of a line: 1. d2d4 is also common.Freeling (Summer 2002), p. 10 Dameo is an abstract strategy board game for two players invented by Christian Freeling in 2000. It is a variant of the game draughts (or checkers) and is played on an 8×8 checkered gameboard.  History  Dameo has its origins in the Christian Freeling's 1988 game Bushka, inspired by the traditional Madagascar game Fanorona. Freeling describes his first experience with Fanorona as a \\"shock,\\" and he felt the game to be very volatile on the whole. Fanorona's capture methods of approach and withdrawal, however, struck him as being unique among Alquerque derived games, which generally feature capture by jumping over pieces. While capture by withdrawal seemed uninviting, capture by approach left an impression on him and he began thinking of ways to incorporate it into a draughts framework. At first the translation was straightforward, and Bushka was essentially International draughts with a 9x11 board size and capture by approach or \\"contact.\\" Freeling found this to be functional, but uninspiring due to the need for connected vacant squares to achieve more complicated mutli-capture moves. He returned to Fanorona which allows a single man to capture whole lines of men by its capture method rather than just a man. This allows a player to \\"...carve deeper into an opponent's position...\\" and achieve similar capturing power to multicapture moves in draughts, but didn't sit right with Freeling due to the oddity of \\"...one man axing a whole phalanx.\\" He let the idea sit for awhile before coming up with the concept of Linear movement and capture, where whole lines of two or men move and capture together as a phalanx. He says that, in retrospect, it was an obvious choice to \\" ...let the capture of a line of men be by a line of men.\\" This development largely led to the completion of Bushka as it stands today lacking only the later reversion to the 10x10 board and a starting count of 15 men. Like capture by approach, the linear movment mechanic inspired Freeling to look at incorporating it into other games. His first attempt was similar to his attempt with capture by approach, he simply added the concept to International draughts. His reasoning was that it would speed up the game, allowing for quicker entry into the mid and late game. The way it worked out however was largely to create gridlock and slow down the game considerably as it added \\"defensive\\" capabilities to both sides without adding any compensating offense. Freeling eventually abandoned the concept in draughts until 15 years later when he encountered Croda. Croda was invented in 1995 by Ljuban Dedić of Croatia, Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Split and the 1989 International Checkers champion of the former Yugoslavia.Handscomb (Spring 2002), p. 7 A variant of Turkish draughts, Croda was the result of a search for a checkers variant with the smallest percentage of draws. In it Ljuban Dedić replaced the sideways movement of the man in Turkish draughts with a diagonally forwards movement and filled the back rank with men for a total of 24 compared to Turkish draughts' 16. He also replaced Turkish draught's rule of removal of captured pieces during a turn with removal of captured pieces at the end of the turn. Croda was the missing piece Freeling needed to apply his concept of linear movement to a draughts game. He described his idea for the invention of the game as follows: > You can't force an unwilling game anymore than an unwilling donkey, and > Dameo remained a vague notion for fifteen years or so, before jumping into > existence in two minutes. This is what happened. After Bushka, which > implicitly revolves around linear movement and capture, I started wondering > about linear movement in a draughts game. The idea was to speed the game up > compared to other draughts games rather than to make it the 'backbone', > because linear capture is not a logical concept in draughts. I eventually > labelled the idea as a 'loose end', because I could not see a satisfactory > solution. The main problem was that I was rather specifically thinking in > terms of International Draughts. In that game movement and capture follow > the same lines: the diagonal subgrid.

While fundamentally similar to Croda, the addition of linear movement, the added diagonal movement of the king, as well as the initial set-up all add to how the game is played and the tactics and strategies available to players.

Accessed 13 Oct. 2020. has online tournaments on Littlegolem, Brainking, and igGamecenter, and is the subject of Belarusian Checkers Expert Aleh Tapalnitski's book Meet Dameo. Game rules The Coup Turc combination in Dameo illustrates several rules.Freeling (Summer 2002), p. 11 White wins with a5:c5 2. e1c3. Black is now obligated to capture the maximum number of men (four) with the multi-jump 2... c5:c1:h1:h3:d3 and must stop on d3, since the jumped men on c3 and d1 remain on the board until the multi-jump has been completed (the already-jumped man on c3 may not be jumped more than once, and the jumped man on d1 prevents Black from jumping the man on d2). The captured men are now removed, and White proceeds with the multi-jump 3. d2:d4:d6:b6:b8+. Dameo is played on an 8×8 checkerboard with 18 pieces per player. Each player’s pieces are arranged so that the bottom three rows, from the perspective of the player, are filled from a1 to h1, b2 to g2, and c3 to f3, forming a distinctive trapezoid shape. * The player with the lighter pieces moves first. Then turns alternate. * The pieces, called men, can only move forward, either straight ahead or diagonally. * In addition, men can jump over one or more other subsequent men of the same color in a straight line forward or diagonally, provided that the square ahead of the line is free. * When a man reaches the last row of the opposite side of the board, it is crowned, or promoted, to a king. The king can move in 8 directions to any available number of cells, like a queen in chess. King promotion greatly increases a man's ability to break the opponent's position, and results in a larger percentage of games ending in victory. Dameo has very few draws. * Capturing involves jumping over enemy pieces and removing them from the board. All captures in Dameo are orthogonal only. A man may capture forwards, backwards and sideways by a short leap to an unoccupied space one square directly beyond the captured piece. If a jump is possible it must be done, even if doing so incurs a disadvantage. * A king may capture by a long leap to any unoccupied square opposite the captured piece, so long as there is no other piece obstructing the path of the king. * Multiple successive captures in a single turn must be made if, after each jump, there is an unoccupied square immediately beyond the enemy piece. One must play with the piece that can make the maximum number of captures. * A jumped piece is removed from the board at the end of the turn. For a multi-jump move, captured pieces are not removed during the move; they are removed only after the entire multi-jump move is complete. * The same piece may not be jumped more than once. * A player with no valid move remaining loses. This occurs if the player has no pieces left, or if all the player's pieces are obstructed from moving by opponent pieces. * A game is a draw if neither player can win the game. * A game is considered a draw when the same position repeats three times by the same player (not necessarily consecutively).  Strategy  Dameo's depth in tactics and strategies compare favorably to other draughts/checkers variants due in large part to its double grid and linear movement of men. Familiar concepts such as majority capture, ladders and bridges, and the coup turc are present, along with unique tactics and strategies, such as the Oblique Hit and the King's Trap. = Majority Capture: = Majority Capture: If Black moves his king on b1 to f1 trying to capture White’s men on f2 and f5, white can respond by moving his man on a3 to a4. Due to the maximum capture rule Black must move f1 to f6 instead of capturing White’s man on a4. This allows White to respond by capturing all of Black’s men on a5, b6, c7, d8, e7, and Black’s King on f6. Majority Capture is a fundamental part of Dameo. The substance of it is the sacrifice of two or more men in order to manipulate the opponent's position to set up a devastating counterattack. This usually takes the form of board spanning multiple captures for material advantage, but can be for the sake of a positional advantage ending in the promotion to a King as well. Majority capture often plays a role in more specific or localized tactics such as the Ladder Strike, Coup Turc, or Oblique hit. = Ladder and Bridge: = Ladder: If Black moves his man on f6 to f5 trying to gain material advantage, White can respond by moving his man on e5 to c7 with linear movement. This forces Black to move his man on b7 and capture white’s men on c7 and d6 landing on d5 because of the maximum capture rule. White can then counterattack with his man on g5, capturing Black’s men on f5, d5, c4, and b3 winning the game. In a ladder strike, the capture resembles moving up or down stairs, as the men are positioned (or forced into a position) where a row of men are lined up diagonally. Clever positioning of your own piece can allow for a majority capture wherein the piece simply \\"goes up or down the stairs\\" by alternating capture up (or down) with right or left movement. Setting up this type of majority capture often involves an opponent's piece carelessly placed between two of your own pieces. A bridge is a simple set up for the ladder strike, where pieces are sacrificed one by one, to position an opponent's man into an ideal position for a ladder strike. They \\"bridge\\" the starting position into a winning ladder strike position = Coup Turc: = Coup Turc: White moves to win by playing his man on f2 to d4 by linear movement. Because of the maximum capture rule Black is forced to respond by playing his king on d8 and capturing White’s men on d4, e2, g3, and f4 landing on e4 (because of the rules where pieces aren’t removed from the board until the end of the turn combined with rule that forbids jumping over the same piece twice). This leaves White’s man on e3 free to counterattack by capturing Black’s king on e4 along with his men on e6 and f7. In Dameo captured men are removed at the end of the turn and not during the turn itself. This, combined with the rule that disallows jumping over the same piece twice, makes the Coup Turc possible. In essence, the tactic is the same as a majority capture, the goal being the manipulation of an opponent's man or king to an advantageous position for a multi-piece capture. The coup turc manages it by forcing an opponent's piece to capture in a sequence ending on a square next to a piece it already captured, lining up perfectly for the player's piece to then counterattack with a majority capture. = Oblique Hit: = Oblique Hit: The opposing squares make the combination of linear movement with majority capture possible. It's generally most useful for the player closest to the King's Row. The oblique hit combines the rules regarding linear movement and maximum capture. In the diagram on the left, white wins by moving c3 to e5 (bottom left white man to the square just to the right of bottom right black man). Black has two captures available, d5 to f5, capturing the man white just moved, and c5 to e3 capturing the man on c4 and then immediately after the one on d3. However maximum capture takes precedence, so black must capture the two men on c4 and d3. This leaves white open to capture the black men on d5 and c6 landing one square away from the King's row (c7). If black moves his man closest to the king's row he won't be able to reach it before white or stop white's other man from reaching the other king's row first. = King's Trap: = King's Trap: If Black’s man on b2 tries to enter the King’s row on b1, white can leave his men there forcing Black to capture c1 and f1 landing on g1. This allows white to capture Black’s king with his man on h1. If Black’s man on d2 tries to enter the King’s row on d1 or e1, he leaves himself immediately open to capture on white’s turn. The king's trap is a defense that takes advantage of Dameo's linear movement . Because of forced capture, if a man lands on the king's row and is crowned, the opponent can, if they have at least four men in a line on the king's row, move the man second closest to the king forward. This forces the king to jump the piece closest to him and land in the empty space directly next to the remaining two men on the king's row, allowing for a counter capture on the next turn. The move is also possible when there is a line of three men ending on the one of the corners. Another king trap made possible by Dameo is the a1,c1,f1, and h1 configuration (pictured). If a man lands on b1 or g1, then on his next turn, because of maximum capture and the king's long range, he's forced to capture men until he lands on g1 (if he started on b1) or b1 (if he started on g1). This allows the opponent to engage in a counter capture of the king on their turn because of their man in the corner. If the oppenent's man lands on either d1 or e1, it leaves him open for immediate capture by the opponent's man on c1 or f1 respectively.Moore, Rex. \\"Different King Traps in Dameo.\\" Boardgamegeek.com, edited by W E.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 29, 2012. In the episode, Moe Szyslak's old bar rag tells its history, from being a medieval French tapestry to ending up at Moe's bar. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse have an argument which prompts Milhouse to leave Bart. Jeremy Irons guest starred in the episode as the voice of Moe's bar rag. Plot At a town meeting at Moe's Tavern, people say that Moe's best friend is his old bar rag. Bart continues with the joke by comparing the rag with Milhouse. Insulted, Milhouse spurns Bart's friendship. The rag tells its life story, from being a medieval French tapestry, woven by Marge after Mr. Burns, Duke of Springfield, killed all their sheep which released demon spirits that forced Marge to weave the encounters the tapestry would have. The Duke was later accidentally hanged by the tapestry when he fell off a mountain; going to a cathedral before Vikings attacked it and Homer tore it; and then to the king of Persia(Nelson). Nelson was then told 1001 stories by Scheherazade (Lisa), who releases his other wives who were thrown in a pit for being boring and decapitates him. The rag was also used as a blindfold for the executed and as a cloth on the chopping block in France; was used as a paint rag by Michelangelo in his creation of the Sistine Chapel; was used for a Confederate flag during the Civil War; and was made into soup during the Great Depression. It then went close to the top of Mount Everest as a flag, though the explorer died from lack of oxygen. Moe's father, the yeti on Everest found the rag and gave it as a gift to his son, an infant Moe. Meanwhile, Bart tries to win Milhouse back as a friend, going to his house at night. Milhouse refuses at first, stating that he is doing well without Bart. Bart reads a poem about friendship to Milhouse, but Milhouse figures out that Lisa wrote it, and tells Bart that he can only win him back by doing something from the heart. As a gesture, Bart agrees to let Drederick Tatum punch him. Milhouse is deeply moved, and renews their friendship. Moe wakes up to find the rag has been stolen. The thief is revealed as Marge, who cleans the rag before returning it. Moe then realizes that he has real friends in the Simpson family, and tosses the rag out the window for Santa's Little Helper, who takes care of the rag and then fights over it with Maggie. The rag, meanwhile, is overjoyed to have finally found an owner who truly loves it. Production Guest star Jeremy Irons provided the voice of the rag. The episode was written by Tim Long. It was first announced to the press at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California on July 23, 2011, during a panel with the producers of The Simpsons. The plot is similar to the film The Red Violin, which tells the story of a mysterious violin and its many owners over a period of several hundred years. English actor Jeremy Irons guest starred in the episode as the voice of the rag. He received the offer over a telephone call, and later told the press that \\"I was delighted to do it and I was honored to be asked.\\" In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Irons commented that when he first received the script, \\"it said, 'The Bar Rag speaks in a very sonorous voice.' And then it said in brackets, 'Think Jeremy Irons.'\\" He recorded his lines during the summer of 2011. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 29, 2012. When airing the episode was watched by 5.1 million viewers, making it the second highest viewed program in the Animation Domination line up. \\"Moe Goes from Rags to Riches\\" received negative reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club criticized the episode for its lack of satire, and wrote that \\"some of the funniest and best episodes [of season twenty-three] have tended to be also the most outlandish, but 'Moe Goes From Rags To Riches' is a major exception, with very few good jokes coming out of the wildest premise of the season to date.\\" He concluded that \\"All in all, this was a rather baffling and disappointing experience that wastes a promising idea.\\" At the 64th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in 2012, Hank Azaria was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Moe, Chief Wiggum, Carl, Comic Book Guy, Duffman and Mexican Duffman in this episode.

He was best known for his work in collaboration with lyricist Edgar Smith on stage shows for the Weber and Fields comedy team. Career Weber and Fields began as a two-man show in the genre of ethnic (German) humor. They were a funny man/straight man comedy duo, a precursor to such famous acts as Abbott & Costello and Laurel & Hardy. They later expanded their act into the genre of vaudeville known as \\"Burlesque\\"—musical stage shows that broadly and somewhat raucously parodied other well-known contemporary Broadway shows, without the striptease acts with which the term was later associated. John \\"Honey\\" Stromberg, whose career began formally in Tin Pan Alley, where he worked as an arranger for the Witmark musical publishing house, was already the writer of a popular song hit (\\"My Girl's a Corker, She's a New Yorker\\") before becoming the principal composer and orchestra conductor (with Edgar Smith the principal writer) for these shows in 1896 with \\"The Art of Maryland,\\" with which Weber and Fields opened their Music Hall. Stromberg wrote the scores for ten productions, conducting nine of them. His most famous composition (the lyrics, however, credited to Robert B. Smith) was \\"Come Down Ma Evenin' Star\\" from Twirly Whirly, written for the great diva of the day Lillian Russell and (as the story goes) found in the pocket of Stromberg's coat after he had committed suicide in July 1902, having ingested Paris Green insecticide. Stromberg had suffered severely from debilitating (probably rheumatoid) arthritis for several years. Contributing heavily to his troubles was the failure of his investment in \\"Stromberg Park,\\" a real-estate development in Freeport, Long Island, with streets named after various Weber and Fields performers. He was greatly mourned on Broadway, and at his funeral the band struck up his famous \\"Come Back Ma Honey Boy to Me.\\" \\"Come Down Ma Evenin' Star\\"is the only song that Lillian Russell is known to have recorded. Stromberg also wrote \\"Ma Blushin' Rosie\\" (also sometimes called \\"Rosie You Are My Posie\\") which was part of the repertoire of the legendary Al Jolson, the theme song of the Rosemary Clooney TV variety show in the 1950s, and even performed in an Abbot and Costello film, The Naughty Nineties.\\" He was one of the outstanding composers of the ragtime era, but his songs have been largely forgotten because most of the best ones were of the genre of so-called \\"coon songs\\"—the name itself contains a racial slur, and the genre consisted of songs containing the most blatant racial stereotypes expressed in a \\"Negro dialect\\" which makes them highly offensive to modern audiences. Although the offensive matter is entirely contained in Edgar Smith's lyrics, not in Stromberg's music, the music has suffered badly from \\"guilt by association\\" with the racist lyrics.

GUASFCU is the oldest and largest entirely student-run credit union in the country, both in asset size and in membership. Despite the arrival of a PNC bank branch on campus in the fall of 2009, GUASFCU assets rose to $12.4 million. By fall 2010, they rose to over $16 million, with over 10,000 individual members. GUASFCU supports a variety of philanthropic events benefiting the Georgetown community, the greater D.C. area, and national charities and foundations, including Relay For Life, Run 4 Rigby, and the John Thompson III Foundation. History In 1982, four students wanted to help the school's community with their banking, ultimately chartering the Georgetown University Student Federal Credit Union with the National Credit Union Administration on February 9, 1983. At the time, Riggs Bank was the only campus option. Students Alyce Russo, Len Schoppa, and Kyle Stevenson did much of the credit union's setup work, receiving permission from the university administration to open on the second floor of the O'Gara Building prior to its demolition in 1984. George Houston, then Georgetown University's treasurer, also helped the group by securing an investment of $100,000 from the school. GUAFSCU was able to offer debit cards to members early on, due to an affinity agreement with MBNA, itself founded in 1982 by Charles Cawley, a Georgetown alumnus. The credit union later moved to the Leavey Center, where it pays rent to the school. In 1994, GUSFCU officially became GUASFCU (the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union) to emphasize the importance of alumni to its membership base. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the credit union matched any donations made to the Red Cross by members. In 2007, the credit union helped organize seminars for graduating seniors on financial literacy. The credit union celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2008 with an address from the Vice Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, Rodney E. Hood, who praised the union for its service. In 2010, the organization was criticized for sharing its customer list with Bank of America as part of a seven-year affinity agreement the banks signed in 2007. In 2011, GUAFSCU worked with The Corp and The Hoya to create the Reimagine Georgetown Partnership, which gave grants of between $500 and $10,000 toward innovative campus projects. That year they also built upon previous efforts begun in 2006 with their ₵ommon $ense financial literacy courses for graduating seniors, expanding the weekly courses to a full month. Today, the organization remains entirely student-run, “from the teller to the CEO.” In 2011, the credit union had 105 student “interns”, who worked up to fifty hours each week. Membership and Services GUASFCU's field of membership is agreed with the National Credit Union Administration. As with all credit unions, membership in GUASFCU is limited to individuals sharing the common bond defined in its credit union charter. Membership in GUASFCU is limited to: * Current Georgetown University students * Georgetown University alumni * Immediate family members of alumni and students GUASFCU offers the typical suite of account services offered by most financial institutions, including savings accounts, checking accounts, and certificates of deposit. The savings product is named “Share Savings” to reflect the fact that a member's initial savings deposit ($10) literally represents their share of ownership in the credit union. GUASFCU is part of the Allpoint ATM network, an interbank networking connecting ATMs in all 50 states. As of December 31, 2008, the Allpoint network has over 43,000 ATMs, located both inside the United States and internationally. GUASFCU members can use any of these ATMs free of charge in addition to the two GUASFCU ATMs located on campus. GUASFCU has their own app for convenience. When opening an account, members receive a “Jack the Bulldog” debit card. GUASFCU launched GUASFCU Rewards to incentivize its members to use their GUASFCU debit card by partnering with local restaurants, retail stores, and more for GUASFCU members to receive discounts. GUASFCU Rewards is constantly expanding its partnerships and uses its social media platforms on Instagram (@GUASFCU) and Facebook (@GUASFCU) to broadcast its discounts. GUASFCU has had discounts with businesses such as: The Tombs, Domino's, Los Cuates, Bluestone Lane, Pinstripes, Flavio, Sugar Lab, Pie Sisters, Booey's, Lou Lou, Saxby's, and more.

The piston valve heads are up against the support plates. The valve spindle is milled out to enable a better through-flow. The 4 piston rings on the valve heads are clearly visible. The valve on this locomotive has a diameter of 300mm The Trofimoff valve () (also Trofimov, Troffimoff or Trofimof) is a springless pressure-compensation piston valve for steam locomotives. Overview The function of the valve is to improve efficiency when running light, with the regulator closed, such as when descending hills. The valve consists of the usual parts of a piston valve: two valve pistons with sealing rings, carried on a valve spindle driven by the valve gear. The difference with a Trofimoff valve is that the piston heads are free to slide on the spindle. When steam pressure is applied, under normal operating conditions, steam is admitted to the centre of the valve chest. This forces the valve heads apart against end stops on the spindle and into their normal working position. The valvegear works as usual. When the regulator is closed, there is no pressure to force the piston heads apart. The pistons remain stationary in the centre of their travel, uncovering the valve ports. There is now a clear path through the valves and the working pistons, allowing free running for the coasting locomotive. Origins The origins of this type of piston valve are not precisely known. It was probably developed in the 1920s in Germany, but its patents seem to have gone at that time to the Soviet State Railway. Other sources speak of it being developed by Bulgarian railway engineers. Russian sources claim that the valve was invented in 1908 by a Moscow Sorting Station service technician I.Trofimov (or Trofimoff, thus the name), but the Russian Revolution and Civil War slowed adoption, so the design gradually spread on the word-of-mouth, and was patented only in the 1920s. Operation Trofimoff valve of locomotive no. 41 1144 in open position. The piston valve heads are loose on the valve spindle, in the middle dead centre position. Left is a supporting element. When fitted, the valve bodies are exactly centred by the valve chest and the spindle through the housing (Tragbuchsen), so that the rod can move freely through the valve heads. Cylinder block with valve chest (Schieberbuchse) on locomotive no. 41 1144. Left: the exhaust port The Trofimoff valve comprises the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto them and the two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near the centre of the cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive. The support plates fixed to the valve spindle also have a piston ring. This slows down the closing of the movable valve heads. Narrow gauge locomotives (such as the DR Class 99.23–24) do not have these piston rings. As a result, when the locomotive switches from running light to running under load there is a characteristic clicking noise as the pistons close. This piston ring on the support body was a further refinement by the former Meiningen repair shop. So that the entire locomotive cylinder block does not have to be changed when the valves are damaged, they are housed in special chests. The valve chest consists of two elements which are forced into the cylinder block from the front and rear. Using special boring tools this chest can be bored out several times during maintenance. In the last illustration the junction of the two halves of the chest and the right-angled ports can be seen towards the rear. These are steam admission ports. Steam is admitted to the pistons of the steam engine through the front diagonal slits. The front area, outside the valve chest, is called the exhaust chest and discharges, via the exhaust pipe, the riser (Standrohr) and the blast pipe cap (Blasrohrkopf) centrally, underneath the chimney of the locomotive. The motion of the valve heads alternately opens and closes the diagonal slits or steam ports, thus controlling the admission and exhausting of steam in the steam engine.

The intent was to create quickly a class of gun-vessels for operations in coastal and shallow waters. Of all the hoys, she had probably the most distinguished career in that she helped fend off two French attacks on the Îles Saint- Marcouf, and participated in the capture of several French vessels. She was sold in 1802. Career Badger was fitted out at Deptford between April and 25 May 1794, with Lieutenant Lewis Mortlock commissioning her in April. In 1795 Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf, which lie off Ravenoville on the Cotentin peninsula in Normandy. Smith constructed barracks and gun batteries and manned the islands with 500 sailors and Royal Marines, including a large proportion of men unfit for ship-board service, described as \\"invalids\\".James (1827), pp.113-7. Smith supported the islands with several gunvessels, including Badger, , and , and the floating battery . Lieutenant Charles Papps Price assumed command of Badger in August 1795, with Mortlock moving to command of the newly captured and commissioned Crachefeu. For administrative purposes, the Navy rated Badger a sloop-of-war, and technically gave Price command of both the Saint-Marcouf islands. Price was an unpopular officer who had repeatedly been passed over for promotion. He apparently spent most of his time on the islands with a prostitute he had brought from Portsmouth. On 7 September 1795 the French mounted an attack with 17 large boats filled with men. They retreated in confusion after coming under fire from the redoubts the British had erected on East Island and from the gunvessels, among them the hoys Badger, , Hawk, and Sandfly. On 28 December 1796, Badger and Sandfly captured Rebekah. Next year, on 21 February 1797, Badger, Sandfly, and the hired armed cutters Champion and Fly captured Souris. Souris was a chasse-maree of 16 guns.United service magazine, No. 10, 1829, p.520. Unlike her sister-ship Eclair, which the British had captured in 1795, the Royal Navy did not take her into service. Near the end of the year, on 12 November 1797, Badger and Sandfly captured the French vessels Eole and Solide Michael. One week later Badger captured Morgonstern. On the night of 6 May 1798 the French approached the islands with a large number of armed troop- carrying barges and some brigs to provide covering fire, as well as 5-6,000 troops. They then launched their attack at dawn. The West Island's batteries, under Lieutenant Price, were ready and inflicted devastating damage on the light invasion craft. Despite severe casualties the French barges continued their approach until they were within musket range, . The garrison of Royal Marines opened fire and the artillery crews switched to canister shot. Six or seven boats sank with their entire crews and troops, and others were heavily damaged. Losses were so high that the French called off the attack; even so, the return journey carried the barges past East Island, which was under the command of Lieutenant Richard Bourne of Sandfly and mounted a battery that inflicted additional severe losses. British casualties were light. For his efforts, Price received promotion to Commander. Nearly five decades later the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Isles St. Marcou\\" upon application to the three still-living British claimants from the battle. On 8 July 1799, Badger captured four French vessels: Pierre de Issigny, Fortunee, St. Pierre de Grandcamp, and Amitie. What was Badgers last capture occurred on 15 September 1800 when Price sighted a French long cutter some four miles off the West Island. He sent Lieutenant M'Cullen of the Royal Marines with 24 picked men in Badgers ten-oared galley and six-oared cutter to catch the French vessel. He also signaled the gun-brig to provide covering fire. Sparkler drew the fire of two batteries, one of two 24-pounder guns and one of two 12-pounder guns, while the boats went in to cut out the French vessel. The French crew ran their boat on shore and cut her masts and rigging. Nevertheless, the British towed her off despite heavy small-arms fire from the shore. The prize was the privateer rowboat Victoire, mounting four swivel guns, 26 oars, and having a crew of at least 40 men, under the command of Captain Barier. Price described her as \\"quite new... the completest Boat for the Service of the Islands that possibly could be constructed.\\" The only British casualty was Badgers gunners mate, who took a musket ball to the shoulder. Fate Badger was paid off in May 1802 and was sold later that year.

Description Noeggerathia could grow to be 3 ft, 3 in tall. It is known for its compound leaves, each possessing two rows of leaflets which composed a 12-inch frond. Noeggerathia may also have possessed a short trunk. The genus may have possessed strobili at the ends of its branches for reproductive purposes. Biseriate sporophylls existed on either side of the cones. It has been previously suggested that Noeggerathiostrobus may have been borne at the end of Noeggerathia's stems, although it is more likely that Noeggerathiostrobus was borne closer to the base of Noeggerathia. Taxonomy Noeggerathia was named after Johann Jakob Nöggerath, a geologist from Germany. The genus was described in 1820 by Kaspar Maria von Sternberg. Noeggerathia and noeggerathialeans in general have been described as difficult to classify as early as 1906 and as recently as 2009. In 1906, the genus was believed to belong to Cycadaceae, a family which currently consists only of Cycas. The species described under Noeggerathia include the following: *Noeggerathia dickeri Horowitz *Noeggerathia foliosa Sternb. *Noeggerathia intermedia Feistm. *Noeggerathia obovata Carruth. *Noeggerathia speciosa Ettingsh. *Noeggerathia zalesskyi Fissunenko *Noeggerathia zamitoides Sterzel Fossil sites Specimens of Noeggerathia have been discovered worldwide. As of 1906, Noeggerathia was known from finds in the European Coal Measures, and there it was considered to be rare. Several well-preserved specimens of Noeggerathia and related plants have been discovered in the Bohemian Massif, with N. foliosa having the most complete fossil record in that area. N. dickeri has been described from the Upper Sandstone Formation of the Sinai Peninsula.

A city is considered to be overurbanized when any additional population will lead to a decline in per capita income of the city. Overurbanized countries are characterized by an inability to provide for their populations in terms of employment and resources.Firebaugh, Glenn. “Structural Determinants of Urbanization in Asia and Latin America, 1950- 1970.” American Sociological Review 44, no. 2 (April 1, 1979): 199–215.Amin, Galal A. The Modernization of Poverty: A Study in the Political Economy of Growth in Nine Arab Countries 1945-1970. BRIILL, 1980.Bradshaw, York W., and Mark J. Schafer. “Urbanization and Development: The Emergence of International Nongovernmental Organizations Amid Declining States.” Sociological Perspectives 43, no. 1 (April 1, 2000): 97–116. The term is intentionally comparative and has been used to differentiate between developed and developing countries.Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. “Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas.” Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6–26. Several causes have been suggested, but the most common is rural-push and urban-pull factors in addition to population growth. Definition The concept of overurbanization first emerged in the mid-20th century to describe cities whose rate of industrialization was growing more slowly than their rate of urbanization.Hauser, Philip M., ed. “Urbanization in Asia and the Far East.” In Proceedings of the Joint UN/Unesco Seminar (in Cooperation with the International Labour Office) on Urbanization in the ECAFE Region, Bangkok, 8–18 August 1956. Calcutta: Unesco Research Center, 1957.Sovani, N. V. “The Analysis of ‘Over-Urbanization.’” Economic Development and Cultural Change 12, no. 2 (January 1, 1964): 113–22. According to sociologist Josef Gugler, the concept was \\"widely accepted in the 1950s and into the 1960s\\" and was split into two approaches, a diachronic and a synchronic approach.Gugler, Josef. “Overurbanization Reconsidered.” Economic Development and Cultural Change 31, no. 1 (October 1, 1982): 173–89.Laumas, Prem S., and Martin Williams. “Urbanization and Economic Development.” Eastern Economic Journal 10, no. 3 (July 1, 1984): 325–32. The synchronic approach, the main one taken in the 1950s, was proposed by sociologists Kingsley Davis and Hilda Golden who defined whether a country was overurbanized based on how its relationship between industrialization and urbanization compared to that of other countries during the same time period. Specifically, countries considered part of the Third World were compared to countries deemed part of the First World. Davis and Golden used data on \\"the percentage of economically active males not engaged in agriculture and the percentage of the population in cities of 100,000 or above in a large number of the countries in the world,\\" in order to define the normal relationship between industrialization and urbanization. They then determine that countries whose rate of urbanization is significantly higher than normal in relation to their rate of industrialization are \\"overurbanized.\\" The authors calculate an \\"expected\\" level of urbanization based on the rates of urbanization of other countries of the world at similar levels of industrialization (measured by percentage of males not engaged in agriculture). A few countries in particular that Davis and Golden measured as having higher levels of urbanization than expected were Egypt, Greece, and South Korea.Kamerschen, David R. “Further Analysis of Overurbanization.” Economic Development and Cultural Change 17, no. 2 (January 1, 1969): 235–53. Davis and Golden did not see overurbanization as a necessarily negative phenomenon, but rather a statistical reality that could have its challenges but would ultimately be self-correcting as an appropriate balance was found between levels of urbanization and industrialization. Scholars on overurbanization agree that N.V. Sovani was one of the first to discount Davis and Golden's argument, as he found that the connection between urbanization and industrialization was more significant in underdeveloped countries than developed ones, suggesting that Davis and Golden's measure of a \\"normal\\" relationship between urbanization and industrialization was not valid. The definition offered by the United Nations and UNESCO in 1956 took a different approach to measuring overurbanization: the diachronic approach. A 1956 UNESCO report measured overurbanization historically, emphasizing that \\"at comparable levels of urbanization developed countries of today had a correspondingly greater proportion of their labour force engaged in non-agricultural occupations\\" than underdeveloped countries. Authors on overurbanization give the examples of France, the United States, Germany, and Canada as developed and often mention the continents of Asia and Africa as well as the region of Latin America as underdeveloped.Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. “Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis.” Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (September 1, 2003): 309–29. This historical approach was applied to Asia in the report, which argued that because a smaller percentage of the labor force was engaged in non- agricultural activities than certain Western developed countries had at similar levels of urbanization, Asia was overurbanized. However, this method has been criticized by scholars who argue that it supports an ethnocentric idea that all countries follow the same path of development. Furthermore, economist N.V. Sovani argued that the evidence offered is not consistent with the development trajectories of developed countries, pointing out specific examples of developed countries such as Switzerland where high levels of industrialization did not correspond with high levels of urbanization. Sociologists John D. Kasarda and Edward Crenshaw pointed out that it was not so much the rate of urbanization of developing countries that was greater, but the absolute numbers of people migrating.Kasarda, John D., and Edward M. Crenshaw. “Third World Urbanization: Dimensions, Theories, and Determinants.” Annual Review of Sociology 17 (January 1, 1991): 467–501. Scholars reference N.V. Sovani as a researcher who questioned whether to accept the 1950s definition of overurbanization. His debunking of the formerly accepted definitions of overurbanization encouraged further scholarly analysis and attempts to redefine the term.Graves, Philip E., and Robert L. Sexton. “Overurbanization and Its Relation to Economic Growth for Less Developed Countries.” Economy Forum 8, no. 1 (July 1979): 95–100. Sovani suggested that claims of overurbanization in underdeveloped countries stemmed from the perception that rapid urbanization had negative consequences. However, he claimed that there still lacked evidence for the idea that rapid urbanization actually made areas worse off. Economist David R. Kamerschen found that there was little statistical evidence to support that \\"rapid urbanization in underdeveloped countries hampers economic growth,\\" suggesting that the phenomenon of overurbanization is questionable. Following Sovani's work, several scholars offered alternative definitions, many of which included not just the relationship between population growth and their means of employment but also the ability of the urban area to provide public services, reflecting that economic development lagged behind population growth in a multitude of ways.Dyckman, John W. “Some Conditions of Civic Order in an Urbanized World.” Daedalus 95, no. 3 (July 1, 1966): 797–812. Several scholars also increasingly embraced a negative connotation for the term. Urban planner John Dyckman suggested that inability to accommodate the expectations of migrants to the city made overurbanization a threat to social order. Economists Philip Graves and Robert Sexton argue that the definition of overurbanization must \\"involve the presence of negative net external effects for the city size in question,\\" suggesting that as long as \\"positive external social benefits\\" from rapid urbanization dominate negative externalities, overurbanization is not at play. Gugler defined overurbanization by two factors: that migration to cities led to a \\"less than optimal allocation of labor between the rural and urban sectors\\" and that migration to cities \\"increases the costs of providing for a country's growing population.\\" Sociologist Glenn Firebaugh disagreed, arguing that if overurbanization is caused by overpopulation, that overpopulation of rural areas could be worse than overpopulation of urban areas. From its origins, the term has been used to differentiate between countries that are considered developed and underdeveloped. Davis and Golden considered a country to be underdeveloped if over half its economically active males were employed in agriculture. The UNESCO report frequently used the terms \\"developed\\" and \\"Western\\" in conjunction. Gugler and others use the terms \\"third world\\" and \\"first world\\" in their discussion.Kentor, Jeffrey. “Structural Determinants of Peripheral Urbanization: The Effects of International Dependence.” American Sociological Review 46, no. 2 (April 1, 1981): 201–11. Causes Sociologist John Shandra states that arguments about the causes of overurbanization fall into five groups: # The rural-push and urban-pull perspective; # The economic modernization perspective; # The political modernization perspective; # The neo-Malthusian perspective; # The dependency perspective. Shandra's analysis of several variables related to each of these categories suggested that all of these arguments have significant evidence except for the economic modernization perspective. Recent scholars believe that a variety of these factors are relevant. =The rural-push and urban-pull perspective= The biggest cause of overurbanization emphasized by scholars is rural-urban migration and the \\"push\\" factors associated with it, including \\"increased population, diminished size of holdings, and absentee landlord exactions.\\" Specifically, lower death rates as a result of demographic transition lead to less available land and fewer opportunities for rural residents.London, Bruce. “Structural Determinants of Third World Urban Change: An Ecological and Political Economic Analysis.” American Sociological Review 52, no. 1 (February 1, 1987): 28–43 The larger process of urbanization is characterized both by these factors that \\"push\\" migrants away from their homes as well as factors that \\"pull\\" them towards new areas. Davis and the UNESCO report both discuss that overurbanization is affected by the \\"push\\" factors away from rural areas being stronger than the \\"pull\\" factors. Pull factors towards urban areas include expansion of economic opportunity and the infrastructure of cities as administrative centers Shandra recognizes the relationship between push and pull factors, arguing that rural conditions, specifically environmental scarcity, cause decreasing income, decreased stability, and increased health risks, leading many to respond by migrating to urban areas. For example, drought in Brazil and Deforestation in the Philippines has made many rural residents' former manner of livelihood impossible, forcing them to move to the nearest city. Because migrants are primarily motivated by factors pushing them out of rural areas rather than factors such as demand for labor pulling them to the city, these rural-urban migrants often find themselves unemployed or quitting \\"low productive agricultural employment to [enter] yet another section marked by low productivity employment, namely handicraft production, retail trading, domestic services in urban areas.\\" A study done by sociologist Glenn Firebaugh showed that agricultural density, a strong indicator of land constraint, and the presence plantation agriculture both have significant effects on overurbanization. These findings were later reversed by sociologist Bruce London, who emphasized that urban migration was not the only potential response to agricultural density. Sovani argues that there is little evidence for the greater role of \\"push\\" factor of increased population in rural areas, as even countries where there is little pressure for land experience this phenomenon, but that instead the opportunity for higher income is responsible for the excessive migration and pressure on cities, as the salary for an unproductive job in an urban area was almost always higher than the salary for unproductive work in a rural area. Graves and Sexton also emphasize that individuals move despite negative factors such as overcrowding, suggesting that individuals still see urban migration as an overall benefit. They argue that if the benefits do indeed outweigh the costs for society as a whole, then the term \\"overurbanization\\" is not appropriate to describe the phenomenon. Gugler argues that while the benefits outweigh the costs for an individual migrating to an urban area, greater costs such as resource scarcity and widespread unemployment and poverty are present when this occurs at a larger scale. Sovani also argues that the definition of overurbanization as developed by scholars in the 1950s and 1960s suggests some sort of limits to population density \\"beyond which the resulting social situation is abnormal,\\" which he argues need to be defined more clearly. Such unsupportable growth would suggest that the cause of overurbanization is urbanization happening too rapidly for a city's level of economic development. Dyckman would call this the \\"pre-takeoff period.\\" However, several scholars have questioned the validity of the connection between urbanization and industrialization. =The economic modernization perspective= The economic modernization perspective on the causes of overurbanization is based on modernization theory, which argues that a hierarchical progression exists from pre-modern to modern society. An explanation of overurbanization from this perspective was given by sociologist Jeffrey Kentor, who wrote that under modernization theory, urbanization results from development and industrialization creating jobs and infrastructure. This argument has been criticized by those who do not ascribe to the assumption that there is a linear path of development that all countries follow. =The political modernization perspective= Shandra's take on the political modernization perspective asserts that environmental degradation causes overurbanization, because the destruction of natural resources in rural areas lowers production and increases poverty and health risks. Supporters of the political modernization perspective suggest that a strong civil society supports lower levels of overurbanization. The presences of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in rural areas, political protests, and democratic government all have the ability of limiting rural-push factors by limiting factors that lead to resource scarcity. INGOs can reduce overurbanization by stimulating alternative employment outside of agriculture, supporting grassroots movements, and improving rural conditions, such as by providing clean water. Considering the role of political protest, Shandra offers the example of the Chipko movement in India, where local women protested deforestation. Protection of this natural resource \\"eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence.\\" Given these considerations, Shandra argues that repressive regimes that do not respond to the desires of the public are more likely to cause higher rates of urbanization than democratic governments. =The neo-Malthusian perspective= The neo-Malthusian perspective is closely related to rural-push and urban-pull factors, but it suggests that the cause behind these factors is population growth, which leads to ecological problems, decreasing agricultural activity, and increased rural poverty. These factors then push rural residents to the city. =The dependency perspective= The dependency perspective on the causes of overurbanization is based on dependency theory, which argued that economic and political systems rendered less developed countries dependent on developed countries, which used developing countries for resources, labor, and markets.Timberlake, Michael, and Jeffrey Kentor. “Economic Dependence, Overurbanization, and Economic Growth: A Study of Less Developed Countries*.” Sociological Quarterly 24, no. 4 (1983): 489–507. Proponents of the dependency perspective argue that rural-push and urban-pull factors are not only a result of population growth and resource scarcity, but that these factors, among others, are caused by the exploitation of developed countries and the capitalist principles they operate under. This is to say that \\"a comprehensive understanding of Third World urbanization cannot focus solely on intra- national, rural-push, urban-pull explanations...but must explicitly incorporate the impact of international capitalist forces.\\" This holds that the negative rural-push factors are a result of the manipulation of developed countries. Michael Kentor found that dependence on foreign investment had a lagged effect on urbanization, meaning that urbanization rates increased a few years after foreign companies began profiting in developing countries. Jeffrey Timberlake and Michael Kentor found in their analysis of 69 less developed countries that there was a significant relationship between dependence, as measured by level of foreign investment, and overurbanization. Additionally, a study done by Bruce London found that factors related to dependency were not only connected to rapid urbanization, but also the negative aspects of urbanization such as urban inequality. Effects =Economic= Davis and Golden did not see overurbanization as an inherently negative phenomenon, but as a statistical fact that would likely correct itself, as \\"urbanization will fall off sharply or industrialization will gain a new impetus.\\" Expanding on the latter, they suggest that overurbanization could spur industrial growth, modernization of agriculture, and social change. Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as \\"the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt.\\" For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers. However, Firebaugh argues that great efficiency is often a result of an increasingly capital-intensive system, which creates inequality between large and small landowners, such as in the Latin American latifundia system. Furthermore, Timberlake and Kentor found in their analysis of economic growth and overurbanization that countries that experienced increases in levels of overurbanization experienced less economic growth. Economic opportunities are lacking due to \\"saturated urban labor markets\\" that exclude much of both the rural and urban populations truncated opportunity structures in rural areas. Furthermore, high infrastructural costs stymie growth. =Social= The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing \\"low levels of living\\" as \\"inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality\\" and \\"large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities.\\" Several scholars have agreed that overurbanization puts a strain on the wellbeing of urban residents due to the lack of adequate public services. Davis and Golden also argue that greater density of dissatisfied impoverished masses could improve conditions to the extent that it provokes the government to enact change to avoid revolution. Dyckman agreed that overurbanization lends itself to the potential for revolution, though he saw this as a potentially destabilizing factor as the conditions would lead to social dissatisfaction and seizure of control by revolutionary leaders. He saw informal squatter settlements as breeding ground for revolutionary activity. =Employment= Despite arguing the potential for economic growth, the UNESCO report also states that overurbanization prevents urban areas and countries from utilizing their \\"potential human and physical resources\\" due to unemployment, under-employment, and misemployment. The idea that rural-push factors are stronger than urban-pull factors in cases of overurbanization suggests that it is population pressure in rural areas rather than the pull of urban jobs that leads to rural-urban migration. Migrants often end up unemployed, as overall urbanization rates rise faster than industrialization and the expansion of the urban job base. In addition to high levels of unemployment, overurbanization is characterized by underemployment and misemployment. Underemployment is defined as the \\"underutilization of labor,\\" or when available laborers are not working at their full capacity due to seasonal variation in production or excess employment of laborers for the amount of work that needs to be done. Misemployment is defined as unproductive labor, meaning that efforts are considered to \\"contribute little to social welfare,\\" such as the full-time labor of begging. While these phenomena are all caused by excessive rates of migration to cities, it is notable that unemployment and underemployment are also problems in rural areas as well. Often unemployment in rural areas is what pushes residents to the city, where better economic opportunities are expected. Proposed solutions A UNESCO report that discussed overurbanization in Asia suggested initial proposals that addressed rural-push factors such as lack of economic opportunity and low productivity by improving agricultural technology and supporting rural industries. Furthermore, rural misery could be reduced by bringing industrialization into rural areas to increase employment and wages and to support the development of infrastructure that creates a \\"more desirable community environment.\\" The UNESCO report also considers the role of governments in committing to providing adequate housing as well as regional planning that takes into consideration social concerns. However, these considerations, among others that propose dealing with unemployment, have been criticized as \\"skirting the issue by addressing 'symptoms' of overurbanization\\" rather than the root cause. Later authors also emphasized improving rural conditions to combat overurbanization. Gugler suggested channeling more resources to rural areas and fighting the tendency to neglect rural areas with what economist Michael Lipton deemed \\"urban bias,\\" the tendency to allocate funds and public works to cities, where the elite and middle classes reside. For example, monetary policies that create artificially low prices for agricultural products harm farmers while creating a surplus for the government. Thus a reallocation of resources to agricultural workers would help shift this system that favors urban elites over the rural poor.Bradshaw, York W. “Overurbanization and Underdevelopment in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Cross- National Study.” Studies In Comparative International Development 20, no. 3 (September 1, 1985): 74–101. Sociologists York Bradshaw and Mark Schafer studied the relationship between INGOs and overurbanization and found that state expenditures towards development were less effective than the role of INGOs. While INGOs were shown statistically to decrease overurbanization, the presence of INGOS did not decrease the effects of foreign capital investment, which is considered one of the root causes of overurbanization by dependency theorists. They and Shandra agree that INGOs can play an important role in decreasing overurbanization by supporting rural communities by promoting both economic and infrastructural development as well as the role of civic society. Case studies =Egypt= Davis and Golden offered the example of Egypt as a country that significantly deviated from the normal relationship between urbanization and economic development. They argue that population growth in rural areas created congestion, poverty, and unemployment. They point out that only 10 percent of economically active males in rural areas are employed in non-agricultural work, compared to 50 percent in France, suggesting that there are no economic opportunities in rural areas in Egypt outside of farming. Egypt had similar levels of urbanization in the late 1940s to Sweden, Switzerland, and France, but significantly lower levels of industrialization. Based on the normal relationship Davis and Golden found between urbanization and industrialization, Egypt had higher levels of urbanization than expected. Dyckman gives an example of a consequence of urbanization in Cairo when he explains that urban dwellers actually have lower literacy rates than those in surrounding villages due to a lack of development. =South Korea= Both the UNESCO report and Davis and Golden identify South Korea as an example of an overurbanized country. Davis and Golden discussed how following the removal of the Japanese after World War II, urbanization continued, but economic growth stagnated. Population growth and urbanization were driven by migration from overpopulated rural areas, even though the majority of jobs available were still in the agricultural sector. The 17.2 percent of Korea's population that were urban dwellers in 1949 were attributed largely to the presence of rural migrants.

The IRB has since relaunched as World Rugby. As CEO, Gosper has overseen Rugby's successful return to the Olympic Games (after 92 years absence) in Rio in 2016 as well as a record-breaking Rugby World Cup in England in 2015. With 2.47 million tickets sold and commercial and ticketing revenues in excess of £600 million, the 2015 Rugby World Cup generated over £260 million in total surplus to World Rugby for reinvestment in the global game. Further record breaking success was achieved in 2019 at Asia's first ever Rugby World Cup in Japan; Commercial revenues, broadcast audiences (including a domestic record rugby of 54.8 million for Japan v Scotland) and social media metrics (2.1 billion video views) at 2019 Rugby World Cup all exceeded those of 2015 Rugby World Cup. Similar successes for rugby are expected from rugby's participation at the Tokyo Olympics 2020. Gosper also led the repositioning and rebranding of the former 'International Rugby Board' to its current name; World Rugby.

It aims to assess, in a continuous and prospective way, the overall solvency needs related to the specific risk profile of the insurance company. Risk Management and own risk and solvency assessment is a similar regulation that has been enacted in the US by the NAIC.http://www.naic.org/Releases/2012_docs/naic_statement_adoption_rmorsa_model_act_ag38.htm Other jurisdictions are enacting similar regulations to comply with the Insurance Core Principle 16 enacted by the IAIS.http://www.iaisweb.org/view/element_href.cfm?src=1/16689.pdf from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors Context The second pillar of Solvency II plans to complete the quantitative capital requirements with quality requirements and a global and appropriate risk management system. The reform provides measures on governance, internal control and internal audit in order to ensure sound and prudent management practices from insurers. Impacts in terms of risk and solvency should supply into upstream strategic decisions. The internal assessment process of risks and solvency, known as the ORSA, is the centerpiece of this plan. In an operational way, the ORSA is part of global process of enterprise risk management (ERM). It is part of a cyclical and iterative system involving the board of directors, senior management, internal audit, internal control and all employees of the company. It aims to provide a reasonable insurance on compliance with the strategy of the company against risks. The ORSA is voluntarily defined broadly by the regulation to encourage insurers to question themselves on the framework of an internal system dedicated to control and risk management. It must in all cases be succinct, easy to update and respect the principles of materiality and proportionality. Regulatory references Since 2003, Solvency II regulation follows the Lamfalussy process, which distinguishes 3 levels of measures, starting from the big principles to the enforcement measures necessary for the operational implementation. The ORSA regulatory update from the NAIC follows the Solvency Modernization Initiativehttp://www.naic.org/index_smi.htm aimed at updating the US regulatory system. =Solvency II= Level 1 measures Level 1 text is the regulatory basis of the reform. It was adopted in 2009 on the same text by the European Parliament and European Council. The ORSA is defined in Article 45 of the Directive. Article 45 of Solvency 2 directive framework (extracts) As part of its risk-management system every insurance undertaking and reinsurance undertaking shall conduct its own risk and solvency assessment. That assessment shall include at least the following: (a) the overall solvency needs taking into account the specific risk profile, approved risk tolerance limits and the business strategy of the undertaking; (b) the compliance, on a continuous basis, with the capital requirements, and with the requirements regarding technical provisions; (c) the significance with which the risk profile of the undertaking concerned deviates from the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital Requirement. Level 2 measures Level 2 measures are technical implementing measures to complement the principles defined in the level 1 text, in view of the operational implementation requirements. Level 2 measures should be adopted by the European Commission on a proposal from EIOPA (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority). In order to advance the development of the reform, EIOPA consults the market, including through Consultation Papers. The ORSA does not fall within Level 2 measures and as such in 2009, during the broad consultation on Level 2 measures, there were no Consultation Papers devoted exclusively to the ORSA. However, a significant number of them refer to it, for example: Consultation paper No. 17 on the calculation of capital add-on Consultation paper No. 24 on the principle of proportionality Consultation paper No. 33 on the governance system Consultation paper No. 56 on the validation of internal models ... etc. Thus, if Level 2 measures do not specify the requirements for the ORSA, they can be used to better understand the interactions of the ORSA with other requirements and clarify the role of the ORSA within the Solvency II system of insurers. Level 3 measures Level 3 measures will be directly adopted by EIOPA. They generally correspond to non-binding recommendations. Since the creation of EIOPA in January 2011, its responsibilities were, however, extended to the production of Level 3 binding measures. The ORSA comes under level 3 texts. To this end, a consultation paper was published in 7 November 2011. This consultation paper presents a set of instructions for the ORSA: *General considerations: the importance of the principle of proportionality, the key role played by the administrative, management and supervisory body, the documentation for the ORSA and the principles supervising the governance of the ORSA ; *Justification and communication for the ORSA processes; *Specific features regarding the implementation of the ORSA: **Assessment of the overall solvency needs: the approach retained must be justified, must be both quantitative and qualitative, must include a sufficient number of stress test and scenarios and must include a prospective dimension; **The ORSA should incorporate the information provided by the actuarial function on the validation of technical provisions; **The results of the ORSA should be integrated into all strategic management processes; **Frequency of the ORSA: at least annually, and must be adapted to the volatility of the risk profile of insurer *Group specificities of the ORSA This text is still under consultation, but can anticipate the impact of Level 3 measures on the ORSA. =NAIC ORSA regulation= While the high-level Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (#505) has been adopted by the NAIC in September 2012, the NAIC ORSA Guidance Manual is being revised in early 2013. The State legislative process is still ongoing, but we can anticipate the regulation to be fully in place in 2015. =South Africa: Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) ORSA regulation= Similar to Solvency II, Insurers and Reinsurers registered in South Africa will be required from 1 April 2017 to perform regular ORSAs. ORSA requirements in South Africa will meet the IAIS standards. Regular reporting will also be required to the Registrar of Insurers. Operational implementation Insurance companies are in the process of setting up their Solvency II plans and generally, the setting up of the pillar 1 has been prioritized. Therefore the ORSA plans are still not mature on the market. However, it appears that four key steps can be identified in the operational implementation of the ORSA: *The definition of the risk profile *The implementation of a strategy for risk management *The evolution of strategic processes *The production of the ORSA report In the US, companies are at various stages of ORSA readiness. =Definition of the risk profile= The risk profile includes all of the risks that the company is exposed, the quantification of these exposures and all protective measures to those risks. The risk profile is different from the regulatory capital determined under Pillar 1. It takes into account the specificities of each insurance company, it integrates all material risks, in a prospective view, and the ORSA leaves open the definition of solvency or the risk aggregation methodologies. In practice, the definition of the risk profile will be increased by the realization of an all-risks mapping, including both the risks identified as part of pillar 1 of the reform Solvency II – underwriting risk, market risk, counterparty default risk, operational risk, intangible asset risk – but also other risks specific to each insurer – illiquidity risk, business risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, etc.. Once the mapping is done, a metric must be defined to quantify the risks. The company can use what is done on the pillar 1 such as a measure of risk, a time horizon and/or a different security level most suitable to its strategy for controlling the risks. =Implementation of a risk management strategy= Once the risk profile is established, the administrative, management and supervisory body must set up the risk management strategy of the company through the following elements: *The risk appetite *The risk tolerances The risk appetite is the maximum aggregated level of risk that a company wishes to take. The risk tolerances represent bounds on the acceptable performance variation associated with the different risk factors. One of the major roles of the risk management function is to support the administrative, management and supervisory body in order to get him to comment on this strategy. The risk management function must not only pass the information necessary to operate, but also give the keys to an appropriation of the culture of risk and a critical analysis of these elements by the leaders. Finally, the risk limits are the operational implementation of the risk tolerances. The risk management function shall coordinate the trades in order to define: *How these risk limits should be expressed; *The methodology for the translation of appetite and tolerances into limits of operational risks. =Evolution of strategic processes= All decisions made in the daily management of the company must then respect the strategy defined. In order to maintain the risk profile to a level consistent with the risk appetite, the leaders have four main strategies: *Abandonment of risk ; *Reduction of risk ; *Transfer of risk ; *Acceptance of risk. Major strategic processes of the insurance company, as the definition of trade policies, reinsurance and asset liability management, should be revised to integrate the dimensions of risk and solvency in the decision-making process. Moreover, the ORSA should enable continued compliance with regulatory requirements in terms of own funds. For that the insurer must establish a set of systematic processes to monitor and control continuous compliance with the risk limits and identify major events – internal or external – which have a significant impact on the risk profile and lead to the update of the ORSA. =ORSA report= The ORSA is the subject of several reporting requirements: *The ORSA is integrated into the narrative of new reports required in Pillar 3 of the reform, both destined for the supervisor and the public; *The ORSA should be a set of internal reporting, particularly during the strategic processes that it must supply; *As part of Level 3 measures being drafted by EIOPA, the ORSA should be a specific reporting, the ORSA report, bound for the administrative, management and supervisory body. Generally, a reporting on the ORSA will contain two parts: *A qualitative report: Description of the risk profile and risk management processes in place; *A quantitative report: Description of the quantitative methodologies used in the context of the ORSA, results, defined strategy, and conclusions. The US ORSA report will contain three sections, as described in the ORSA Guidance Manual:http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_e_orsa_wg_exposure_guidance_manual.doc * Description of the insurer’s enterprise risk management framework * Insurer assessment of risk exposures * Group risk capital and prospective solvency assessment See also = Related articles = * Solvency II Directive * Risk management * French Prudential Supervisory Authority * Basel II = References = External links * Official European website of EIOPA * Solvency II Directive 2009/138/EC * EIOPA : Level 3 measures : – CP 008/2011 – Solvency II: Consultation Paper On the Proposal for Guidelines on Own Risk and Solvency Assessment * Consultation Papers on the website of EIOPA * Presentation on the ORSA ORSA – The heart of Solvency II – EIOPA – 2011 * NAIC ORSA Working Group Category:Insurance legislation Category:Financial risk management Category:Capital requirement ","title":"Own risk and solvency assessment"},{"id":"34537370","text":"The year 1979 was marked by many events that left an imprint on the history of Soviet and Russian Fine Arts.

Vincenzo was legitimated by his father in 1619. Like his grandfather Vincenzo Galilei, the younger Vincenzo became a lutenist.  Life  Vincenzio was born in Padua like his two sisters: Virginia (1600-1634) (later Sister Maria Celeste) and Livia (1601-1659) (later Sister Arcangela). He was named after his grandfather. In 1619, after his mother's death in 1612, his birth was legitimized by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. As a consequence, the names of the older and younger Vincenzo Galilei became identical, sometimes leading to confusion in biographies.

Biography  Langdon was born in Adelaide, served in the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War, skipped university in favor of a writing career, and spent six years exploring South America. He undertook many different jobs prior to making his way to Tahiti to escape a cold Canadian winter. This journey changed his life. Because he couldn't find a single book that told the story of Tahiti, he returned home to Adelaide and write his own; Tahiti, Island of Love. After some time reporting for The Advertiser in Adelaide, Langdon took on a role at Pacific Islands Monthly in Sydney. During his six years at the magazine his reputation for original and high quality research on forgotten aspects of Pacific history caught the attention of Professor Henry Maude who was setting up the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau (PMB). One of the first major projects he supervised as the executive officer of the PMB in the 1970s was the microfilming of more than 2,100 logbooks of American whaling, trading and naval ships active in the Pacific in the 19th century. Copies of these 420 reels of microfilm were then distributed to a number of participating libraries in Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. To increase their utility, he supervised a team of researchers to index the microfilmed logbooks and the results were later published in two volumes.Robert Langdon (ed.) American whalers and traders in the Pacific: a guide to records on microfilm, (1978) Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, , &, Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century, (1984), Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, .  Alternative history  Langdon's research on the history of Amanu island and the possible origin of antique Spanish ship cannons discovered on the atoll in 1929 resulted in his book The Lost Caravel. In this book Langdon presented evidence for his theory that the cannons were from the San Lesmes, a ship of the Spanish Loaisa Expedition. Langdon proposed that the San Lesmes had foundered on the atoll, thrown off the cannons to refloat, sailed to Tahiti where some members of the crew remained, and then onward to discover New Zealand. New Zealand film maker Winston Cowie's books Nueva Zelanda, un puzzle histórico: tras la pista de los conquistadores españoles (2016) and Conquistador Puzzle Trail (2015), published with the support of the Embassy of Spain to New Zealand, address the San Lesmes theory and consistent with Langdon's theory propose that it may have been wrecked in New Zealand, with oral tradition from elders on the Pouto Peninsula recording a wreck described as 'Spanish', and helmets and armour that had been found in the sand and caves of the peninsula. Greg Scowen's 2011 novel The Spanish Helmet also references the San Lesmes theory, basing much of the story on the presumed journal of the captain of the San Lesmes, Francisco de Hoces.

Hunters and advocacy groups packed the chamber in support of the measure, seeking access to patches of government land that meet at corners. Supporters of the bill said denying access at such corners ensures that mega-land owners like Ted Turner lock up blocks of public land. In 2015, Ellie sponsored House Bill 318, a bill modeled after 2009's \\"Brandon's Bill\\" and it will expand mandatory insurance coverage for kids with Down Syndrome in the State of Montana. The bill passed and was signed by Governor Steve Bullock. For several sessions, she sponsored a bill that would have required residential adolescent youth programs to be regulated like other schools for vulnerable youth. Montana currently has an exemption to regulation if the programs are religiously affiliated. There were several schools in Montana with allegations of significant abuse and neglect and the state was limited in its ability to intervene. During the 2015 and 2017 sessions, CNN sent news reporters to the Montana Capitol to cover the efforts. The bills were always killed by the lobbyists from the Montana Family Foundation, which is largely funded by Montana Congressman Greg Gianforte. In 2019, Lee Newspapers published an in-depth series on the abuse and need for legislative action. Ellie was the driving force behind Senate Bill 396 in 2015, which drastically revised and deregulated motor carrier laws in the state and eliminates the requirement that new taxi services demonstrate public convenience and necessity to acquire a certificate from the Montana Public Service Commission. It created a separate Class E classification for transportation network carrier services like Uber and Lyft. The legislation was an immense work across the aisle; in the Senate it was officially sponsored by Sen. Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, and the original legislation in the House was co-sponsored by Ellie, and Speaker of the House Rep. Austin Knudsen, along with a bipartisan coalition of other lawmakers, including Rep. Daniel Zolnikov. Uber made Ellie officially, \\"Passenger Zero\\" in Montana for her work to bring Uber to Montana, and she was invited to take Montana's first Uber ride in Missoula. Ellie is known for her bipartisan work in economic development, including supporting Montana's microbrewery industry. 2017's House Bill 541raised the production cap on Montana's microbreweries from 10,000 barrels annually to 60,000 barrels while still allowing them to sell beer in on-premises taprooms. According to a 2016 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana, the craft brewing industry in the state contributed $103.2 million to the economy in 2015 while employing 702 people and creating a total of 1,044 jobs. She served as the Minority Chair of the House Human Services Committee, overseeing Medicaid Expansion, opening the door to health insurance for 70,000 Montanans. After a nearly six-and-a-half hour-long hearing, Committee Chair, Republican Art Wittich, killed the bill. With significant bipartisan support, Ellie sponsored the \\"revenge porn bill\\", making it illegal to share non-consensual pornography. Revenge porn, or the distribution of an individual's sexual photos or videos without their consent, victimizes thousands of unsuspecting people across the nation.

Bach. He additionally translated oratorios by Beethoven, Brahms, Dvořák, Gounod, Liszt, Saint-Saëns, Schumann and Weber, as well as secular operas by Mozart, Gluck and Wagner. He also compiled psalters and hymnals and worked on the Revised Version translation of the Bible. Origins Troutbeck was born in the village of Blencowe in the parish of Dacre in Cumberland on 12 November 1832. He was the son of a country gentleman, George Troutbeck (1795-1848), and his wife Eliza Stephenson (1799-1877). He had a plaque erected in the Troutbeck Chapel, built in 1443 in the church of St Mary's-on-the-Hill in Chester, which acknowledged his ancestors buried there, including Sir William Troutbeck, Chamberlain of Chester, killed at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459. Career He was educated at Rugby and at University College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1856, a Master of Arts in 1858, and was later awarded a Doctorate in Divinity in 1883. Ordained in 1855, he was vicar of Dacre to 1864, Precentor of Manchester Cathedral from 1865 to 1869, a Minor Canon and later Canon Precentor at Westminster Abbey from 1869, and a Chaplain in Ordinary to Queen Victoria. Translations Troutbeck has been credited as a \\"prolific\\" and \\"indefatigable\\" translator of continental European oratorio and opera texts. All of J.S.Bach's major choral works, including the Christmas Oratorio (1874), the Magnificat (1874), and the St Matthew and St John Passions (1894 and 1896 respectively), were translated by him for the music publisher Novello. He also translated nine of Bach's cantatas, with the same publisher. Until 1999 Troutbeck's Christmas Oratorio (1874) was the only complete English version, as was his Magnificat until a new edition was published in 2000. Also brought by him to English-speaking singers and audiences were, amongst others, Beethoven's Mount of Olives, Karel Bendl's Water Sprite's Revenge, Brahms's Song of Destiny, Félicien David's The Desert, Dvořák's Mass in D, Patriotic Hymn, Spectre's Bride and St Ludmilla, Gounod's Redemption, and Weber's Jubilee Cantata. His opera translations included Mozart's Cosi fan tutte and Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, Iphigénie en Tauride, and Iphigénie en Aulide, and Wagner's Der fliegende Holländer. Troutbeck was also a compiler of psalters and hymnals including the Manchester Psalter and Chant Book (1867), the Westminster Abbey Hymn Book (1883) and the Catholic Paragraph Psalter (1894). and from 1870 to 1881 was secretary of the committee translating the Revised Version of the Greek New Testament. Family On 3 September 1856 in Liverpool, he married Elizabeth, daughter of businessman Robinson Duckworth. They had four children: :Georgina (1858-1947). :John (1860-1912), who was the father of the diplomat Sir John Monro Troutbeck. :Edith (1862-1937), who married the academic and musicologist Sir William Henry Hadow. :Henry (1866-1923). Death Dying on 11 October 1899, at 4 Dean's Yard, Westminster, he was buried beside his wife in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.Mrs. A. Murray Smith (1906) Annals of Westminster Abbey His will, leaving effects of over 22,000 pounds, was proved on 18 November by his four children. Ancestry.com (subscription required) Troutbeck’s son – the Coroner John Troutbeck's son, also named John Troutbeck, was the Westminster Coroner who opened the inquest, in October 1888, on the remains of a woman discovered in a vault of a new police office on the Thames Embankment – the case known as the Whitehall Mystery. Troutbeck, the Coroner, who was appointed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, was, like his father, an accomplished linguist who often “dispensed with the services of interpreters at his enquiries.” He was a skilled musician, playing the viola in the orchestra at the coronation of King George V at Westminster Abbey in June 1911.

In 1973–74, Stone missed three matches, making 51 appearances in all competitions as York finished third in the Third Division, thus winning promotion to the Second Division for the first time in the club's history. An injury sustained in York's 1–0 defeat away to Sunderland on 14 September 1974 resulted in him missing the rest of 1974–75, which he finished with six appearances in all competitions. Having again been restricted to six appearances in all competitions for York in 1975–76, Stone signed for Fourth Division club Darlington in July 1976. He moved to Darlington in search of a fresh start, which he achieved with great success, making 120 league appearances and scoring 14 goals for the club. Stone left Darlington three years later to sign for Third Division club Grimsby Town for a £22,500 fee in July 1979. He helped Grimsby win the Third Division title, and thus promotion to the Second Division, in 1979–80. Stone finished his Grimsby career with 94 league appearances and two goals, before signing for Rotherham United of the Third Division in September 1983. He retired from football following his spell with Rotherham, for whom he made ten league appearances and scored one goal in 1983–84.

She became famous (or infamous) for rum- running on the US Pacific Coast between 1920 and 1933. The Vancouver Maritime Museum says that Malahat delivered \\"more contraband liquor than any other ship.\\" Construction Malahat was built in 1917 in Victoria, British Columbia, by Cameron Genoa Mills Shipbuilders. Her owner was the Canadian Steamships Company of Montreal. As a result of the \\"ship emergency\\" during World War I, Malahat was pressed into service even before her engines were installed. She \\"performed reasonably well under sail\\" during her first voyage. Malahat was comfortably equipped for long voyages as of 1934, with \\"a coal- burning fireplace in the owner's quarters and two full-size bathtubs.\\" Active until 1944, the Mabel Brown class Malahat was the longest lived of all the 12 five-masted auxiliary schooners built in Victoria and North Vancouver in 1917–1918. Career as a rum-runner The Malahat was owned by the Riefel family of Vancouver, a family involved in the local brewing industry. The Malahat sailed out to \\"Rum Row\\", located somewhere between the Pacific Coast and Hawaii (possibly the Farallon Islands), where she served as a floating warehouse while smaller, faster vessels picked up the contraband liquor and ran it ashore. The bottles were offloaded in cases or in burlap bags holding 12 bottles apiece. Some of the fast \\"mosquito boats\\" were equipped with Liberty engines, and could reach speeds of 25 knots. Estimates of the top speed of these smaller vessels range as high as 35–40 knots. The Malahat was not very fast; one source claims that she could do \\"about five knots!\\"David Williams, World Ship Society, Vancouver, B.C. Jim Stone, son of Malahat's Captain Stuart Stone, interviewed family and acquaintances to learn more about his father's activities during the Prohibition Era (1920–1933). In his book, My Dad, The Rum Runner, Stone determined that the Malahat could carry up to 100,000 bottles of illegal liquor, of which 40,000 were stowed on deck. Another source cites a figure of \\"84,000 cases in the hold plus approximately 16,000 on deck when the Ryuo II loaded from her, summer 1933.\\" One cargo, consisting of \\"32,000 cases of whiskey and 15 barrels of beer,\\" required \\"almost nine months to discharge\\" due to the foggy weather in 1925 along the California coast. Gibbs estimates that the ship delivered 120,000 cases annually, \\"even when the trade was slow,\\" making one or two trips per year. Surprisingly, Malahat managed to smuggle rum for 13 years despite the efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard. Apparently this was possible in part because Captain Stone's sister-in-law, who lived near Jericho Beach, Vancouver, received information from \\"sympathetic coastal vessels\\" and transmitted coded radio messages to the ship regarding the Coast Guard's whereabouts. Evasive tactics included dropping burlap bags of sand over the side as a decoy, and marking the site as a cache of liquor, in order to distract the Coast Guard's attention while the ship sailed off to another location. One practical commentary on the Malahat's career says: Two other captains served aboard Malahat during the rum-running era in addition to Capt. Stuart Stone: Archie McGillis and Captain John D. Vosper. The Malahat's illegal liquor could be found as far south as San Diego, California, allegedly transported from Malahat's anchorage 140 miles south, at Punta Colonet, Baja California. Lumber schooner Malahat began her career as a working lumber schooner, sailing between Canada and Australia, transporting a cargo of 1,300,000 board feet in 1917. Malahat became a lumber schooner once again after Prohibition ended. In 1934, Gordon Gibson, Sr. and his brother were so excited to discover Malahat up for sale for only $2,500 that they bought her on the spot. She was used as a self-propelled log barge, carrying Sitka spruce from the Queen Charlotte Islands to the booming ground at the Powell River in Teakerne Arm in Desolation Sound. Because the Malahat required a crew of fifteen, one of the challenges for a local lumbering operation was assembling a crew with experience in seamanship as well as logging. Her engines were removed during World War II, \\"when engines were in short supply.\\" Douglas, p. 131 Shipwreck She foundered in Barkley Sound in 1944, and was towed to Powell River, British Columbia, where her wreck remains. The Malahat was the subject of the 2002 The Sea Hunters: True Adventures With Famous Shipwrecks documentary, The Malahat: Queen of the Rum Runners, narrated by Clive Cussler. Legacy The career of the Malahat has been cited as recently as October 2011, on the floor of the House of Commons of Canada, by MP Randall Garrison, as an example of potential negative consequences that could result from passing a new law to prohibit transport of wine between provinces for personal use. Malahat Spirits Co., a San Diego, CA distillery specializing in rum, is named after the Malahat.

Electric go-karts are mostly intended for recreational usage, though high-performance models for a more serious kart racing are also offered.  Advantages / disadvantages  = Advantages = Acceleration is usually better than conventional petrol engine karts and the speed is sufficient for use on most kart circuits. Torque in electric motors are usually greater than that of a petrol engine equivalent. Electric go-karts are low maintenance, requiring only that the lead-acid batteries of the karts to be plugged into an array of chargers after each run. Since they are pollution-free and emit no smoke, the racetracks can be indoors in controlled environments. Most fully charged electric karts powered by lead-acid batteries can run a maximum of 30 minutes before performance is affected. An alternative is lithium polymer or lithium ion batteries, which last longer and offer higher performance. Electric go-karts do not have fuel tanks or other flammable materials which can prove to be safer in case of an accident. However, batteries (especially lithium polymer batteries) can still catch fire or explode if severely damaged during such accident. = Disadvantages = Despite having a lower maintenance, electric go-karts often have higher operating and maintenance costs, as batteries and electric motors are typically more expensive than that of conventional engine, especially those powered by lithium batteries. Electric go-karts powered by lead-acid batteries are low-powered and have a very short battery life; these go-karts can only run a maximum of 20 or 30 minutes before performance is affected, thus making it unsuitable for use in more serious racing.

The call for desegregation and the first years of its implementation led to a series of racial protests and riots that brought national attention, particularly from 1974 to 1976. In response to the Massachusetts legislature's enactment of the 1965 Racial Imbalance Act, which ordered the state's public schools to desegregate, W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts laid out a plan for compulsory busing of students between predominantly white and black areas of the city. The hard control of the desegregation plan lasted for over a decade. It influenced Boston politics and contributed to demographic shifts of Boston's school-age population, leading to a decline of public-school enrollment and white flight to the suburbs. Full control of the desegregation plan was transferred to the Boston School Committee in 1988; in 2013 the busing system was replaced by one with dramatically reduced busing.  History  =Racial Imbalance Act = The Racial Imbalance Act of 1965 is the legislation passed by the Massachusetts General Court which made the segregation of public schools illegal in Massachusetts. The law, the first of its kind in the United States, stated that \\"racial imbalance shall be deemed to exist when the percent of nonwhite students in any public school is in excess of fifty per cent of the total number of students in such school.\\" These racially imbalanced schools were required to desegregate according to the law or risk losing their state educational funding. An initial report released in March 1965, \\"Because it is Right-Educationally,\\" revealed that 55 schools in Massachusetts were racially imbalanced, 44 of which were in the City of Boston. The Boston School Committee was told that the complete integration of the Boston Public Schools needed to occur before September 1966 without the assurance of either significant financial aid or suburban cooperation in accepting African American students from Boston or the schools would lose funding. = Boston School Committee opposition to the Racial Imbalance Act = After the passage of the Racial Imbalance Act, the Boston School Committee, under the leadership of Louise Day Hicks, consistently disobeyed orders from the state Board of Education, first to develop a busing plan, and then to support its implementation. = Development and implementation of busing = In 1972, the NAACP filed a class-action lawsuit (Morgan v. Hennigan with Tallulah Morgan as the main plaintiff) against the Boston School Committee on behalf of 14 parents and 44 children alleging segregation in the Boston public schools. Two years later, Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts found a recurring pattern of racial discrimination in the operation of the Boston public schools in a 1974 ruling. His ruling found the schools were unconstitutionally segregated, and required the implementation the state's Racial Imbalance Act, requiring any Boston school with a student enrollment that was more than 50% nonwhite to be balanced according to race. As a remedy, Garrity used a busing plan developed by the Massachusetts State Board of Education, then oversaw its implementation for the next 13 years. Judge Garrity's ruling, upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and by the Supreme Court led by Warren Burger, required school children to be brought to different schools to end segregation. The busing plan affected the entire city, though the working-class neighborhoods of the racially divided city—whose children went predominantly to public schools—were most affected: the predominantly Irish-American neighborhoods of West Roxbury, Roslindale, Hyde Park, Charlestown, and South Boston and; the predominantly Italian-American neighborhood of the North End; the predominantly black neighborhoods of Roxbury, Mattapan, and the South End; and the mixed but segregated neighborhood of Dorchester. In one part of the plan, Judge Garrity decided that the entire junior class from the mostly poor white South Boston High School would be bused to Roxbury High School, a black high school. Half the sophomores from each school would attend the other, and seniors could decide what school to attend. David Frum asserts that South Boston and Roxbury were \\"generally regarded as the two worst schools in Boston, and it was never clear what educational purpose was to be served by jumbling them.\\" For three years after the plan commenced, Massachusetts state troopers were stationed at South Boston High. The first day of the plan, only 100 of 1,300 students came to school at South Boston. Only 13 of the 550 South Boston juniors ordered to attend Roxbury showed up. Parents showed up every day to protest, and football season was cancelled. Whites and blacks began entering through different doors. An anti-busing mass movement developed, called Restore Our Alienated Rights. The final Judge Garrity-issued decision in Morgan v. Hennigan came in 1985, after which control of the desegregation plan was given to the School Committee in 1988.  Impact  The integration plan aroused fierce criticism among some Boston residents. Of the 100,000 enrolled in Boston school districts, attendance fell from 60,000 to 40,000 during these years. Opponents personally attacked Judge Garrity, claiming that because he lived in a white suburb, his own children were not affected by his ruling. The co-author of the busing plan, Robert Dentler, lived in the suburb of Lexington, which was unaffected by the ruling. Judge Garrity's hometown of Wellesley welcomed a small number of “black” students under the voluntary METCO program that sought to assist in desegregating the Boston schools by offering places in suburban school districts to black students, but students from Wellesley were not forced to attend school elsewhere. Senator Ted Kennedy was also criticized for supporting busing when he sent his own children to private schools. = Protests and violence =  ROAR  Restore Our Alienated Rights (ROAR) was an anti-desegregation busing organization formed in Boston, Massachusetts by Boston School Committee chairwoman Louise Day Hicks in 1974. Using tactics modeled on the civil rights movement, ROAR activists led marches in Charlestown and South Boston, public prayers, sit-ins of school buildings and government offices, protests at the homes of prominent Bostonians, mock funerals, and even a small march on Washington DC. By 1976, with the failure to block implementation of the busing plan, the organization declined.  Violence  There were a number of protest incidents that turned severely violent, even resulting in deaths. In one case, attorney Theodore Landsmark was attacked and bloodied by a group of white teenagers as he exited Boston City Hall. One of the youths, Joseph Rakes, attacked Landsmark with an American flag. A photograph of the attack, The Soiling of Old Glory, taken by Stanley Forman for the Boston Herald American, won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography in 1977. In a retaliatory incident about two weeks later, black teenagers in Roxbury threw rocks at auto mechanic Richard Poleet's car and caused him to crash. The youths dragged him out and crushed his skull with nearby paving stones. When police arrived, the man was surrounded by a crowd of 100 chanting \\"Let him die\\" while lying in a coma from which he never recovered. In another instance, a white teenager was stabbed nearly to death by a black teenager at South Boston High School. The community's white residents mobbed the school, trapping the black students inside. There were dozens of other racial incidents at South Boston High that year, predominantly of racial taunting of the black students. The school closed for a month after the stabbing. When it opened again, it was one of the first high schools to install metal detectors; with 400 students attending, it was guarded by 500 police officers every day. In December 1975, Judge Garrity turned out the principal of South Boston High and took control himself. Judge Garrity increased the plan down to first grade for the following school year. In October 1975, 6,000 marched against the busing in South Boston. = Impact on Boston Public Schools = In 1987, a federal appeals court ruled that Boston had successfully implemented its desegregation plan and was in compliance with civil rights law. Although 13 public schools were defined as \\"racially identifiable,\\" with over 80 percent of the student population either white or black, the court ruled \\"all these schools are in compliance with the district court's desegregation orders\\" because their make-up \\"is rooted not in discrimination but in more intractable demographic obstacles.\\" Before the desegregation plan went into effect, overall enrollment and white enrollment in Boston Public Schools was in decline as the Baby Boom ended, gentrification altered the economic makeup of the city, and Jewish, Irish and Italian immigrant populations moved to the suburbs while black, Hispanic, and Asian populations moved to the city. Although the busing plan, by its very nature, shaped the enrollment at specific schools, it is unclear what effect it had on underlying demographic trends. By the time the court-controlled busing system ended in 1988, the Boston school district had shrunk from 100,000 students to 57,000, only 15% of whom were white.  End of racial desegregation policy  In 1983, oversight of the desegregation system was shifted from Garrity to the Massachusetts Board of Education. With his final ruling in 1985, Garrity began transfer of control of the desegregation system to the Boston School Committee. After a federal appeals court ruled in September 1987 that Boston's desegregation plan was successful, the Boston School Committee took full control of the plan in 1988. In November 1998, a federal appeals court struck down racial preference guidelines for assignment at Boston Latin School, the most prestigious school in the system, the result of a lawsuit filed in 1995 by a white parent whose daughter was denied admission. On July 15, 1999, the Boston School Committee voted to drop racial make-up guidelines from its assignment plan for the entire system, but the busing system continued. In 2013, the busing system was replaced by one which dramatically reduced busing. As of 2015, the voluntary METCO program remains in operation, as do other inter-district school choice programs.  Boston's current school demographics  In 2014, Boston public schools were 40% Hispanic, 35% black, 13% white, 9% Asian-American and 2% from other races. In that same year, the school-age population of Boston was 38% black, 34% Hispanic, 19% white, and 7% Asian. The vast majority of white public school enrollment is in surrounding suburbs. In metropolitan Boston, public school enrollment in 2014-2015 was 64% white, 17% Hispanic, 9% black, and 7% Asian.

Although the name refers to the state's Chontal Maya population, modern Chontalpa is a subregion of the Grijalva Region, and formed with economic concerns in mind. A large percentage of the state's Chontal Maya population does live here, with the municipality of Nacajuca having the largest concentration of indigenous, with the next largest concentration found just east of the region in the Villahermosa area. The subregion's economy is based on agriculture, especially livestock production as well as oil drilling, which have been at odds with each other because of severe degradation of the environment since the mid 20th century. Chontalpa is also home to Tabasco's two main archeological sites, La Venta and Comalcalco, along with numerous smaller sites. Geography and environment Wetland area near Sánchez Magallanes The Chontalpa is officially a subregion of the Grijalva, which is defined as lands in Tabasco reliant on the Grijalva River and related surface water. It consists of the municipalities of Huimanguillo, Cárdenas, Comalcalco and Paraíso, with its capital as the city of Comalcalco. [National Institute for Federalism and Municipal Development and Government of the State of Tabasco] It is the second largest of Tabasco's subregions with an area of 7,482.12km2, representing 31.08% of the state. Chontalpa borders the Gulf of Mexico to the north, the state of Chiapas to the south, the state of Veracruz to the west and the municipalities of Centla, Centro (Villahermosa) and Jalpa de Méndez to the east. Like the rest of Tabasco, the Chontalpa region is mostly flat floodplain with a small area of highlands along the border with Chiapas. The floodplain is low, with an average of only ten meters above sea level with areas below sea level. Elevations generally do not exceed forty meters, but the highest is Mono Pelado at 970 meters above sea level. The climate is cold and humid with most rains in the summer and fall (Am (f) gw). It is subjects to numerous storms and even hurricanes coming in from the Gulf of Mexico with an average annual rainfall of about 2000 mm. These storms are unimpeded by the low flat plain, with the elevations near the Chiapas border the first barrier. The rain that falls here feeds much of the area's rivers, especially the Amatan and Oxlotan, with rainfalls up to 4,000 mm per year. Other important rivers in the flat areas include the Samaría, Mezcalpa, Tonalá and Santana. This means that large quantities of fresh water flows towards the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to rivers, this also produces large areas of lakes, marshes and other wetlands and lagoons around estuaries such as the Mecoacán Lagoon . It also means that the flat areas of the region are highly susceptible to flooding, including the 2007 Tabasco flood. These were caused by unusually heavy rain in October of that year brought in by multiple cold fronts, bringing in a record of 1,054mm of rain to the region in only three days. However, significant flooding is relatively frequent with major events occurring in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, the Blasillo River caused major flooding affecting 4,500 families. Wild vegetation is that associated with wetlands both on land and aquatic. This includes the popal-tular tree (Thalia geniculata), kapoks (Ceiba petandra), palo mulato (Bursera simaruba), zapote (Pachira aquatic), maculis (Tebebuia rosea) and royal palm (Royestonea regia) . Rainforest used to cover much of the area but now are only found in about four percent of the entire state. Wetlands with reeds and mangroves are still common. The mangrove forests of the region are home to over 100 species and are a main source of oxygenation. They also work to prevent erosion and to control pollution. However, deforestation of mature mangroves in the area continues to be a serious problem despite government efforts to replant. The problem is the cutting of the plants for wood by local residents. Most of the deforestation of the region has occurred as a result of the Chontalpa Plan, which began in the 1960s to drain areas of wetlands to convert them into farm and pasture land. Wildlife has been seriously harmed by the activities of man but still include iguanas and other lizards, various species of birds and other reptiles such as freshwater turtles although a number of these are in danger of extinction. Attempts to preserve what it left of the area's wild vegetation include a number of wildlife reserves. The Parque Estatal de la Sierra or Sierra State Park is located in the municipalities of Tacotalpa and Teapa. It also includes the village of Oxolotan, which is a traditional indigenous community and Tapijulapa, a Pueblo Mágico . The Villa Luz Ecological Reserve extends over forty hectares, with eighty percent covered in dense vegetation and in all there are various streams both fresh water and sulfur laced liquid which rise from springs in the earth. The Oxolotan River also passes through with several waterfalls, as well as the Sardinas Cave which has almost 1500 meters of explored area. The Kolem Jaa Ecological Ranch is a reserve of rainforest and springs with sulfur water. It is part of a reforestation effort in the higher elevations of the region. It contains a botanical garden with a large collection of orchids. The La Chontalpa Ecological Reserve is a state protected area on the Colegio de Postgraduado- Campus Tabasco campus founded in 1995 with 277 hectares. It is one of the last remains of the medium growth evergreen rainforest of Tabasco dominated by a tree called “canacoite” (Bravaisia integerrima). The reserve has 247 species of plants with some in danger of extinction. Other plants include cachimbo (Platymiscium yucatanum), tinco (Vatairea lundelii) and zapote prieto (Diospyros digyna). Wildlife includes mammals (20.2%), birds (61.3%), reptiles (10.9%) and amphibians (7.6%). It is located just off the Cárdenas- Coatzacoalco highway. Demographics Traditional dress from the Chontalpa region It has a population of 593,668 with about 41% living in urban areas and the rest in rural areas. Much of the state's Chontal Maya population is located in the region, especially in the Nacajuca municipality. The name “chontal” comes from Nahuatl and means “foreigner” but their name for themselves is yoko yinikob (true men) and yoko ixikob (true women). They are not related to groups in Guerrero and Oaxaca which are also called Chontals. The name “Chontalpa” is derived from the Nahuatl meaning “land of foreigners.” However, the modern region is not defined by the presence of the Chontal Maya but rather by economic considerations. Over seventy percent of the state's Chontal Maya population is divided between the municipalities of Nacajuaca which is in the region and Centro (Villahermosa), which is just outside it. Nacajuca has the largest percentage of indigenous population in the state, with about 37% of the population of Nacajuca speaking Chontal. Estimates of the indigenous population is inexact because the official census only counts speakers of indigenous language and since it is not known how the Chontal Maya define themselves and who is a member of the ethnicity. Relatively little is known about the Chontal Maya culture and daily life in comparison to other indigenous groups in Mexico. The Chontales lost several aspects of their culture in the 20th century with modernization such as the daily use of traditional clothing and most do not live in traditional houses, rather have houses similar to the rest of Tabasco with running water and electricity. However, the Chontal Maya language perseveres with increases in the number of native speakers in the past decades. The language is of the Mayan family, most closely related to the Ch'ol of Chiapas. Chontal Maya has several mutually intelligible dialects with three main ones, North and Tapotzingo found in and around Nacajuca and a South dialect centered in Macuspana. Most speakers are bilingual, speaking Spanish as well. Economy Toasted cacao beans at the La Chonita Hacienda Natural resources include petroleum deposits, fertile soils, and lakes and shoreline for fishing. The main economic activities of the region are agriculture, livestock and oil drilling. The economic development of the 20th century brought infrastructure such as modern roadways. This led to an abundance of construction jobs, often filled by the Chontal Maya. Cultivated crops include cacao, coconut, bananas, sugar cane, pineapple, citrus fruits, corn and beans. Mass livestock raising was introduced with the Plan Chontalpa, especially cattle and sheep. One means to exploit the extensive wetlands is through a project to create “camellones chontales” (Chontal ridges). These are based on the ancient Aztec technique of chinampas to create areas of artificial land. The project began in the Chontal village of Tucta in the municipality of Nacajuca in the 1970s. The projects created platforms of land separated by canals. The platforms measure twenty by twenty meters with canals among them to introduce native fish and aquatic plant species for subsistence. Chontalpa has most of the cacao plantations of Tabasco. One of these is the La Luz Hacienda, which was founded at the beginning of the 20th century, which today offered guided tours. It and others such as the La Chonita Hacienda are part of The Cacao Route. These establishments often offer tours, workshops and other services such as accommodations, food service, recreational activities and more. The route has the only museum dedicated to cacao and chocolate. It also has a number of Chontal communities such Cupilco, the Comalcalco arqueological zone and Paraíso with its beaches. Most oil drilling occurs around the communities of La Venta, Cárdenas, Paraíso and Cunduacán . The economic boom due to oil has made the cities of Cárdenas and Comalcalco the second and third most important in the state. History Oil platforms and tanker off Varadero Beach in Paraíso In the area which is now Chontalpa, various ethnicities such as the Chontal Maya, Zoques and Nahuas inhabited before the arrival of the Spanish. The Chontal Maya were found around the rivers in the flatlands, with the Zoques found in the highland area. The Nahuas were dispersed in various areas. Because of the wetlands created by the flow of the rivers, much of this area was inaccessible for hundreds of years. However, during the colonial period various haciendas were established in the region to produce cacao, livestock and other products. The indigenous population diminished greatly and almost disappeared with estimates of the loss as high as ninety percent due to disease and abuse at the hands of the Spanish. While the area, nor the rest of the state, developed economically as other areas of New Spain, it was still considered important as a transit point and for its production of cacao. Despite Independence, little changed in the area economically until the latter 20th century, mostly due to the discovery of petroleum. Today, most in the region are not employed in agriculture. Oil drilling began in the 1950s, with the production initially for domestic use. Large scale drilling began in the 1970s for foreign income, controlled by the state oil company PEMEX. It became the major income producer in the 1970s. It also signaled the beginning of ecological damage in the region, although drilling was not the only factor. Environmental damage since this time has affected fishing, agriculture and livestock, leading to tensions between the local population and PEMEX, including legal actions, protests and event the blocking of oil facilities. Another major factor in the economic development and environmental degradation of the region was the implementation of the Chontalpa Plan. This was a plan introduced by the federal government to develop the hydroelectric potential of the area's rivers, and convert wetlands into those suitable for agricultural production. In 1951, President Miguel Alemán Valdés created the Grijalva River Commission, following similar projects by predecessors for the Papaloapan and Tepalcatepec River areas in the 1940s. One of the goals of this project was to alleviate the poverty of the region due to lack of economic development, especially in rural areas. The project was undertaken in an area not well known to the engineers with the aim of draining and converting to farmland 50,000 hectares or about fifteen hectares per family. Much of the land went for the production of corn, cacao and bananas. The work of the Grijalva River Commission had a substantial impact on the Chontalpa Region especially in its center. It led to the formation of the Unión de Ejidos Colectivos which included various pre existing ejido organization along with state and federal authorities to give farmers credit and other economic assistance. By the 1960s, families in the area were earning twenty times that previously. The Chontalpa Plan did benefit the families that lived in the wetlands of the Chontalpa area but at the expense of the environment. The destruction of the rainforest in the area was swift with outside mechanized equipment and administration. Although originally promoted as a project for local ejidos, it quickly became controlled by elements of Mexico's elite. Initial expropriation of the wetlands was indiscriminate and those who opposed it were forcibly ejected. The political economic system became oriented towards meeting the interests of outside metropolitan areas. Archeology Structure 5 at Comalcalco Chontalpa is home to the two most important archeological sites in the state, La Venta and Comalcalco, which represent the Olmec and Maya civilizations respectively. La Venta was the most important civic-religious center of the Olmec civilization, the first major culture of Mesoamerica. The site shows a number of the characteristics of Olmec culture, including depictions of jaguars, colossal heads and images of figures of rotund children. The site dates back to about 1000 BCE and declined around 400 CE, replaced in importance by San Lorenzo. The museum associated with La Venta is in Villahermosa proper called Parque Museo de la Venta. It contain thirty three major pieces from the site and includes displays about Olmec customs, government, astronomy and writing. This park was created in the 1950s by writer Carlos Pellicer to protect the most important pieces of the archeological site. There are also exhibits on the flora and fauna of the area. The Comalcalco archeological site is in the center of the region. Comalcalco is distinct from other Mayan sites as its monumental structure are made of adobe, rather than stone. There are three main groups of buildings called the North Plaza, the Grand Acropolis and the East Acropolis. The architectural style is similar to Palenque but made with bricks instead of stone. The Grand Acropolis is the most important group of monumental buildings, which are also the tallest. There is a site museum with ceramics and other pieces on display. Although Comalcalco is the best known Mayan site in Chontalpa, it is not the only one. There are numerous small sites. One of these in Malpasito near the town of Huimanguillo which is identified as both Mayan and Zoque. The main buildings surround a plaza and include a Mesoamerican ball courts and a temazcal. It also includes about sixty stones finely sculpted with figures of animals, humans and geometric designs.

Christopher Powers Higgins (March 16, 1830 – October 14, 1889) was an American Army captain and later businessman who with Frank Worden founded the Hellgate Trading Post and the nearby city of Missoula, Montana. He erected one of the first lumber and flouring mills on the Clark Fork River near present Downtown Missoula as well as many of Missoula's first buildings and establishments. He was one of the original county commissioners, member of first legislature of the Montana Territory, and incorporator of The Montana Historical Society. Higgins Avenue and bridge as well as the Higgins block in Downtown Missoula are named after him. He is buried in Missoula Cemetery. Early life Christopher P. Higgins was born in Ireland March 16, 1830. He immigrated to the United States in 1848, immediately moved to the western frontier and joined the army. In 1853 in joined newly designated Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens and Lieut. John Mullan as wagon master for the Stevens survey of the Bitterroot and Missoula Valleys, done for the planned construction of a railroad through to region to connect the Mississippi River with the Pacific Ocean. Governor Stevens, also acting as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, signed the Hellgate treaty to which Higgins was a witness with the Bitterroot Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai tribes that guaranteed passage. Founding of Missoula Higgins Block In 1860 Higgins partnered with Frank Worden, a general merchandise store owner in Washington to set up the Hellgate Trading Post in the Missoula Valley along the Mullan Road, which had only just reached the area that summer. On March 30, 1863, Higgins married Juliet P Grant, the daughter of another Missoula pioneer Richard Grant (for whom Grant Creek is named). Hellgate would never grow very large because the water supply was unsuitable to power the lumber and flour mills Higgins and Worden wanted to construct. The settlement was moved four miles east to the location of today's Downtown Missoula in 1865 and renamed Missoula Mills. In 1873, Higgins organized the Missoula National Bank as one of the first banks in Montana Territory and located it next to his and Worden's store built two years earlier and now called the Worden & Company Store. The store itself had, in fact, been built on the location of Higgins' former log home before he constructed a larger home several blocks east. In 1888, Higgins began construction of the Higgins Block but died before its opening in 1889. The building is now on the National Register of Historic Places.Montana Mainstreets: A guide to historic Missoula Allan JamesMathews - Montana Historical Society Press - 2002 Rivalry with A. B. Hammond Andrew B. Hammond arrived in Missoula in 1872 and within four years he was an owner and managing partner of the Eddy, Hammond and Company (reorganized as the Missoula Mercantile in 1885), which soon replaced Worden and Company as the leading mercantile in western Montana. As the construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad approached Missoula, both Higgins and Hammond wanted to ensure the railroad would stop there. Higgins and Worden offered prime real estate to the rail line with the hope of ensuring not only a stop, but the lumber contract for the ties, bridges, and buildings that would need to be constructed. The city secured the railroad, but Eddy, Hammond and Company received the lumber contract. In 1881, Hammond began buying stock in Higgins' Missoula National Bank and by 1888 Higgins was forced out and the bank's name changed to First National Bank of Missoula. Higgins rivalry with Hammond would last until his death in 1889, and would continue with his family. C. P.'s son Frank G. Higgins would become mayor of Missoula in 1892 despite opposition from Hammond, and two years later when the Higgins Avenue Bridge was to be replaced there was debate as to whether the bridge should go straight across north-and-south or diagonal toward the Bitterroot with the Higgins preferring the latter. When it was put to a vote, Higgins prevailed. Legacy Higgins' name is given to both Higgins Avenue and the Higgins Avenue Bridge where the numeric center of Missoula is. On land donated to the city for the construction of the University of Montana in 1893, the streets are named after Higgins' seven children: Francis, Maurice, Arthur, Helen, Hilda, Ronald, and Gerald. The name Gerald Avenue, in fact, replaced what was once named Hammond Avenue after Andrew Hammond.

The historical borough is in the townland of Macreddin West in the civil parish of Ballykine, barony of Ballinacor South. It also gives its name to the adjacent townland of Macreddin East. Wicklow County Council's 2010 development plan recognises the site as an \\"area of archaeological potential and significance\\" as \\"site of one of the few 17th century Plantation Towns established in Leinster\\". The pre-1800 parliamentary borough of Carysfort and the title Earl of Carysfort derive from Carysfort. History The name Macreddin is believed to come from the Irish Magh Chrídáin \\"plain of Cridan\\". In 1875, John O'Hanlon identified him as a Celtic Christian saint \\"Criotan, Credan, Credanus, or Cridanus\\", son of Iladon, who was also venerated at nearby Aghavannagh, and in Cornwall. Price says he was more likely a local chieftain at the time Saint Kevin proselytized the area. Macreddin was granted to the monastery of St Saviour, Glendalough in the 12th century. When the Diocese of Glendalough was merged with the Archdiocese of Dublin, Macreddin was transferred to the Priory of All Hallows in Dublin. On the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, it was transferred to Dublin Corporation. County Wicklow was established in 1606 and the Dublin Castle administration sought to contain the threat to English planters from the Gaelic O'Toole and O'Byrne clans in the mountains. A fort was built at Macreddin while Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland was Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1625-28, and named \\"Cary's fort\\" in his honour. Samuel Lewis records that the garrison was withdrawn to Dublin in the 1641 Rebellion and the site was captured from the English by the O'Byrnes. No visible trace of the fort remains; the site is reputed to be in \\"Castle Field\\". In 1628, Carysfort was incorporated as a borough under a royal charter from Charles I. The corporation was to have the same powers as at Jamestown, County Leitrim. The 1835 report of the Commissioners into Municipal Corporations in Ireland stated the charter did not appear \\"ever to have been acted on for any corporate purpose, except that of returning Members to Parliament before the Union\\". The charter granted the 13 members of the corporation \\"600 acres of arable land and pasture, and 276 acres of bog, mountain, wood, and underwood\\" in free burgage, and three smaller parcels of land in socage to each fund a specific purpose: first the garrison, second a Protestant curate and glebe, and third a free school. A 1688 charter of James II restated these grants; but by 1835 all lands except the school's had been alienated. The elevation of Carysfort was too high and settlers soon moved south down the valley to Aughrim. In the eighteenth century there was still a fairground at the crossroads, with \\"riotous\\" two-day fairs held at Whitsun and All Saints. Michael Dwyer stayed in Macreddin when repairing to the Wicklow Mountains after the 1798 Rising. The 1835 commissioners' report described Carysfort as \\"a small village, containing a few houses of the humblest class\\", and concluded, \\"There is but a thinly-scattered population in the neighbourhood, and neither trade or commerce of any kind in the village, and there seems to be no occasion whatever for reviving the corporation.\\" =Religion= Moycreddin [sic] cemetery in 1874 In the Church of Ireland, Carysfort was a royal chapelry, originally with a thatched chapel by the school in Sheeana. It was within the perpetual curacy of Ballinaclash erected in 1832. A chapel of ease at Gallows Lane in Macreddin opened in 1869 to replace that at Sheeana; it was deconsecrated in 1991. The Catholic church was dedicated to Saint Brigid and Lewis in 1837 reported it as the parish church of Rathdrum. In 1864 it was rededicated to Laurence O'Toole; it is now in ruins. Upper Macreddin Cemetery is in the churchyard, while the larger Lower Macreddin Cemetery is further down the valley. =Royal School= Under the 1628 charter, Carysfort Royal School was established with a schoolhouse in the neighbouring townland of Sheeana More, to be funded from revenue of lands there. The revenue was not well used and the school was of poor quality; an 1810 work said \\"about 50 Boys attend in summer, but not above a dozen in winter\\". To resolve such abuses there and at other endowed schools, an 1813 Act of Parliament transferred management of the lands to Commissioners for Educational Endowments in Ireland.53 George III c.107 s.xi £500 was spent on a new building and in 1833 the school had 110 students funded from 361 acres. Whereas the other Royal Schools established by the Stuart kings were grammar schools, the Carysfort school was \\"a small, neglected, and inefficient primary school\\" and in 1887 the Commissioners recommended using its endowment to fund schools in more convenient locations in Aughrim and Rathdrum. In 1925 the management was transferred to the Department of Education of the new Irish Free State,S.I.

It was a pocket borough of the Proby family, who took the title Baron Carysfort. It was disfranchised under the Act of Union 1800, and John Joshua Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort received the standard £15,000 compensation for the loss of its patronage.

Branching off the Main Line at Polgahawela Junction the line heads north through North Western, North Central and Northern provinces before terminating at the northern port of Kankesanthurai. The line is long and has 55 stations between Polgahawela Junction and Vavuniya. It is the longest railway line in Sri Lanka. The line opened in 1894. Major cities served by the line include Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Jaffna. The popular Yal Devi service operates on the line. The line was severely affected by the civil war and no services operated north of Vavuniya after 1990. Reconstruction of this section of the line commenced following the end of the civil war in 2009 and was fully completed in early 2015. History =Construction= The Jaffna Railway Commission report published in 1891 recommended the construction of a new railway line (now known as the northern line) from Polgahawela to Kurunegala and a survey of a line to Jaffna. The line would join the Main Line at Polgahawela Junction, allowing trains to run to the capital Colombo. Approval was given in 1892 and the new line to Kurunegala opened on 14 February 1894. Approval was given in December 1897 for the construction of the Northern Railway and an announcement was made in the Legislative Council in October 1899 that authorisation had been given for the construction of a railway line connecting the north with Colombo. Tenders for the construction of railway line from Kurunegala to Kankesanthurai were called in January 1900 and construction of the new line started at Kurunegala in April 1900. Construction of the Kankesanthurai-Chavakacheri section, including Jaffna, began in July 1900. This section was officially opened by Governor Sir J. W. Ridgeway on 11 March 1902. The Chavakacheri-Pallai section was opened on 5 September 1902. The northern railway line up to Anuradhapura was opened on 1 November 1904 and the construction of the line up to Medawachchiya was completed on 11 March 1905. The construction of the line was completed in the next few months and on 1 August 1905, the first train from Colombo arrived at Jaffna Railway Station. The journey took 13 hours and 20 minutes. The single track line between Kankesanthurai and Vavuniya had 16 stations and 12 sub-stations. =Operational height= An express train called Yarl Devi was introduced on the northern line on 23 April 1956, cutting the journey time between Jaffna and Colombo to 7 hours. The service flourished and Jaffna became the second largest station in the country. The Yarl Devi service was the largest revenue earner for Sri Lanka Railways. Eight passenger trains and six freight trains operated daily between Jaffna and Colombo. By the early 1980s six thousand people travelled daily on the northern line. =War and partial closure= The remains of Jaffna station after the war The line's fortunes waned when the civil war started in 1983 - the government increased the number of soldiers stationed in the north, many of whom used the line to return to their homes in the south. Thus the Yarl Devi service became a target for Tamil militants as it passed through areas they controlled. It was blown up by Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization cadres near Murikandy, Mullaitivu District on the night of 19 January 1985, killing 34 people including 22 soldiers and destroying the tracks. The service was attacked again on 25 March 1986 between Puliyankulam and Vavuniya. The railway tracks were relaid by the Indian Peace Keeping Force and in August 1987 the Jaffna-Colombo rail services resumed. However, the deteriorating security meant that only a few people used the service. After the IPKF withdrew from Sri Lanka in 1990 the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam took over most of the territory the IPKF had controlled, including Jaffna. In the middle of 1990 the truce between the LTTE and Sri Lankan government broke down and full scale war erupted. Intense fighting took place in and around Jaffna as the Sri Lankan military tried to regain control of the area. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the fighting took refuge in Jaffna Railway Station. The station was bombed by the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) on 9 August 1990, damaging 6 train carriages and killing eight people nearby. The station was bombed to a shell by the SLAF. On 13 June 1990 the Yarl Devi service rolled into Jaffna but it could not return to Colombo as the railway track had been destroyed (it would be the last rail service into Jaffna). The station was bombed again on 16 August 1990. In the next few years the entire track between Kankesanthurai and Vavuniya and abandoned railway coaches were removed by the Sri Lankan military and Tamil rebels for use as bunkers. =Reconstruction= Jaffna station during reconstruction The Sri Lankan government regained control of most the Jaffna Peninsula, including Jaffna, in 1995 but no effort was made to rebuild the northern line or the stations along it. Following the end of the civil war in May 2009 the government initiated various projects to rebuild the northern line from Vavuniya to Kankesanthurai. The line between Vavuniya and Omanthai was rebuilt by the Sri Lankan military. Thandikulam railway station was re-opened on 6 June 2009 and Omanthai railway station was re-opened on 27 May 2011. The contract to reconstruct the line between Omanthai and Pallai was awarded to IRCON International, the Indian state-owned engineering and construction company. The project was to cost US$ 185 million and would be financed by a soft loan from the Indian government. In June 2011 an agreement was signed between Sri Lanka Railways and the Bank of Ceylon for the reconstruction of Jaffna Railway Station. The project was to cost LKR 89 million. In July 2011 it was announced that IRCON had also been awarded the contract to reconstruct the line between Pallai and Kankesanthurai. The project was to cost US$ 150 million and would be financed by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of India. The reconstruction of the entire northern line had been expected to be completed by the end of 2013. The line between Omanthai and Kilinochchi was re-opened on 14 September 2013. The line between Kilinochchi and Pallai was re-opened on 4 March 2014. The line between Pallai and Jaffna was re-opened on 13 October 2014. The final stretch of the line, between Jaffna and Kankesanthurai, was re-opened on 2 January 2015. Route description The northern line consists of a main line running from Polgahawela to Kankesanturai and a short branch line to Mihintale. The route serves as a backbone for the country's rail services with other lines branching out from it. The Batticaloa line and the Mannar Line branch off from the northern line at Mahawa (Maho) and Medawachchiya, respectively, to serve Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Mannar, and Talaimannar. The route mainly runs through open country, across the North Central plains. At Elephant Pass, it crosses the lagoon to enter the Jaffna peninsula. Services The northern line is mainly served by intercity trains connecting major cities. More than a dozen trains run on the line in each direction each day. Major named services that use the line include Yal Devi and Udaya Devi. =Operators and service providers= Sri Lanka Railways operates passenger services on the northern line, the most notable service on the line being the Yal Devi. ExpoRail operates a premium service on certain Sri Lanka Railways trains on the northern line, in partnership with Sri Lanka Railways. Infrastructure The northern line is entirely single track, except at stations. Track gauge is broad gauge. As train frequency increases, it is becoming increasingly challenging to operate trains running both direction on the single-line track. The stretch between Polgahawela and Maho is 70 km long, but only has five stations with the facility to let trains pass each other. To relieve this, SLR is planning to add a second line to dual track this portion of the line. As of June 2012, the feasibility study on this project had yet to begin. The northern line is not electrified, regular services run on diesel power. Current operating speed between Polgahawela and Omanthai is 80 km/h. The section from Omanthai to Kankesanturai is being rebuilt with a design speed of 120 km/h, significantly increasing operating speeds. =Signalling= South of Anuradhapura, the line currently operates on a lock-and-block signaling system. In 2011, the railways began a project to add electronic signalling to the rail lines in the north. The northern line between Anuradhapura and Kankesanturai would be given electronic signalling with centralized traffic control, interlocking colour light system with electrically operated points, and track detection system. Level crossings would also be connected to the signalling system, thus ensuring safety at crossings.

It forms part of the Diocese of Southwark and with the church of St John, and St John the Divine, it forms a team of Anglican churches serving residents, businesses, schools and Kingston University. The church is the only Grade I listed building (but not structure) in Kingston. A church at Kingston sprang up in Saxon times and Egbert, king of Wessex, held his great council at the site in 838. Seven Saxon kings of England, including Athelstan and Ethelred the Unready, were crowned here in the 10th century. The present church was begun in 1120 under the orders of Henry I and has been developed since then. It is a cruciform church with a central tower and a four-bay nave, with Perpendicular clerestory, choir, north and south aisles, transepts and chapels. The exterior is of flint with stone dressings and a parapet of stone battlements. History Edward the Elder was crowned in Kingston in 900 at the Coronation Stone, as was his son Athelstan in 925. In the following years Kingston was the site of the consecrations of Edmund I in 940, Eadred in 946, Eadwig in 955, Edward the Martyr in 975 and, finally, Ethelred, who was crowned by Bishop Oswald of Worcester in 978. Outside the south door of the present building are some outlines marked by stones, which are all that remain of the Saxon church and chapel of St Mary. The present church was begun in 1120 under the orders of Henry I and has been developed since then. During the 14th century, the Norman nave was widened. The chancel and the chapels of the Holy Trinity to the north and St James to the south were added during the 15th century. The original high wooden spire on top of the tower was struck by lightning and almost entirely destroyed in 1445 and was rebuilt in 1505. In 1600, the church was described at vestry meeting as being \\"much out of repair and there being a need for a speedy repair of the same in several places ... to prevent further damages and inconvenience.\\" The tower was taken down to the level of the nave and was strengthened and rebuilt in 1708 in brick, with dipped parapet and pineapple ornaments on the corners. The chapel of St. Mary, which stood at the south-east of the church, next to the south chapel of St. James, was pulled down in 1730 after some of the walls fell, killing the sexton. The church was much restored in the 19th century, by Brandon from 1862 to 1866 and Pearson in 1883. A 12th-century doorway was discovered in the west wall of the nave in about 1865 but destroyed. Ceilings were reconstructed and the organ gallery at the west end was removed. In the 1890s, remaining galleries were removed and new roofs provided to the nave, aisles and transepts. After the First World War, the choir vestry was built on the north wall and a memorial chapel dedicated to the East Surrey Regiment. The same regiment also has a set of memorial gates at the south entrance to the churchyard, on Market Place (the regiment's badge appears over them). The gates were formally opened on Remembrance Sunday 1924 by the Bishop of Kingston, Percy Herbert. The gates became a separate Grade II listed building in April 2016; the church is Grade I listed. The church contains a 14th- century wall painting of St. Blaise, a 17th-century marble font attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, twelve bells and an 18th-century carillon, the great west window of the 19th century, and the Frobenius organ installed in 1988. There are several notable monuments in the church. On a slab in the south chapel is a brass figure of a man standing on a mound dressed in a fur-lined tunic with his hands in the position of prayer. In a recess on the south wall of the south chapel is the tomb of Sir Anthony Benn, Recorder of Kingston and afterwards Recorder of London, who died in 1618, containing his recumbent effigy in his lawyer's robe and ruff collar and cuffs. Between the south door and the tower is Sir Francis Chantrey's seated figure commemorating Countess Louisa Theodosia, wife of Prime Minister Lord Liverpool. While Louisa was buried at Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire, Lord Liverpool's second wife, Mary was interred at All Saints after her death in October 1846.

It's easy to feel how Calveyra negotiates expressive dilated forms, with incidental clauses that frequently capsize poetic essence. Attentive to the pure and docile nature he gives to the voices that come from its urgent intimacy, Calveyra dispenses with the heavy appoggiaturas and connectors that are themselves the strictness of logical language.\\"Mastronardi, Carlos. Sur Magazine Nº 261. November 1959. Like many Argentine artists and intellectuals, Calveyra emigrated to Paris in the 1960s buoyed by the dynamic cultural landscape there at the time. By the 1970s, the Guerra Sucia obstructed any possibility of a return to Argentina. Calveyra remained in Paris, where he worked with the English film and theater director Peter Brook and published his own works with the French publishing house Actes-Sud. In 1988, poet Juan Gelman recommended Calveyra to the Argentine publisher Jose Luis Mangieri (Libros de Tierra Firme), effectively reintroducing him to an Argentine audience. Argentine literary critic Pablo Gianera recently wrote, \\"It isn't inexact to say that Arnaldo Calveyra never abandoned the Entre Rios (Mansilla) landscape, this primary terrain that gave forth to the almost adamic relationship he sustains with language. Everything he names, seems named for the first time ... Calveyra's language of discovery is a mechanic of surprisingly reversible time; with each word, he recovers with intimacy and pain that which no longer exists. It is the movement of memory that closes like a circle around origins and seizes forever those things that are as fleeting as light itself.\\".

Because pruned elm trees acted as vine supports, this was taken as a symbol of marriagePeter Demetz, “The elm and the vine: notes towards the history of a marriage topos”, Proceedings of the Modern Language Association, 73.5, New York 1958, pp. 521-532 and imagery connected with their pairing also became common in Renaissance literature. Various fables were created out of their association in both Classical and later times. Although Aesop was not credited with these formerly, later fables hint at his authorship. Marriage imagery The 'marriage' of elm trees and vines continued in Italy from Roman times into the 20th century.The historical relationship of elms and vines, P. Fuentes- Utrilla, R. A. López-Rodríguez and L. Gil, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid 2004. There are references to this in both works on husbandry and in poetry. The most famous of the latter was Ovid's account of the myth of Vertumnus and Pomona in his Metamorphoses. Vertumnus takes the shape of an old woman and urges the reluctant goddess to marriage by pointing to the vine in her orchard. In the version by the work's first English translator, Arthur Golding: ::::::::::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: :::Book 14, lines 755-63 The subject was commonly painted in Europe between the 16th - 18th centuries, and there are examples which feature a vine trained up an elm from Italy, the Netherlands, France and England (see the Gallery below). This was partly encouraged by the entry of the imagery into Emblem books, beginning with the most popular of them all, Andrea Alciato's Emblemata, in which it figures under the title Amicitia etiam post mortem durans (Friendship lasting even after death).Emblem 160 This interpretation had been influenced by a first- century CE poem by Antipater of Thessalonica in which a withered plane tree (rather than an elm) recounts how the vine trained about it keeps it green.Greek Anthology III.231 Alciato was followed in this interpretation by Geoffrey Whitney in England,Choice of Emblemes 62 using Alciato's illustration but accompanied by verses of his own. Others who took up this theme include Otto Vaenius in his Amorum emblemata (1608), where it is interpreted as love continuing after the death of a partner;Emblem 123 by Jean Jacques Boissard in his Emblemes latins (1588), where he takes it as a sign of undying friendship;pp 64-5 and by Daniel Heinsius in his Emblemata Amatoria (1607), where he makes the tree a plane, following the Greek epigram, and interprets it as the sign of undying love. The French version of his Latin poem reads :::: :::: \\\\- as the vine survives about the plane, So will my love the stroke of fate.Alison Saunder, The seventeenth-century French emblem: a study in diversity, Geneva CH 2000 p.168 Grateful dependence of a different sort was signified by the French emblem of Gilles Corrozet in his Hecatomographie (1540), where a fruiting vine acknowledges its debt to the 'little tree' that supports it.Glasgow University Library In the following century an adaptation of the emblem was adopted as printer's mark by the House of Elzevir for their press in Leiden. There a scholar picks grapes from the vine trained round the tree, on the other side of which is the Latin device Non Solus (not alone), pointing to the alliance between learning and literature.The Private Library Vertumnus and Pomona from the 16th – 19th century File:Melzi - Vertumnus and Pomona.jpgFrancesco Melzi 1517-20 File:Vertumnus en Pomona Rijksmuseum SK-A-2217.jpegHendrik Goltzius 1613 File:Bloemaert, Abraham - Vertumnus and Pomona - 1620.jpgAbraham Bloemaert 1620 File:Vertumnus and Pomona 1630 Paulus Moreelse.jpgPaulus Moreelse 1630 File: François Boucher - Vertumnus-And- Pomona.jpgA tapestry design by François Boucher, 1757 File:Hamilton Vertumnus and Pomona.jpgWilliam Hamilton, 1789 File:Westall Vertumnus and Pomona.jpgRichard Westall, early 19th century The fables A fable, or at least a parable, of the mutual support of the unfruitful elm and the fruiting vine appeared early on in the quasi-Biblical Shepherd of Hermas. The interpretation given it there was that the rich are in need of the prayers of the poor, which they can only acquire by acts of charity.III.2 There is a return to the association with marriage in the anonymous poem \\"The Elm and Vine\\", first published in England in 1763 and reprinted elsewhere for some fifty years both there and in the USA. The story is set \\"In Aesop's days, when trees could speak\\" and concerns a vine that scorns the tree's proposal, only to take it up when beaten down by a storm.The Gentleman's Magazine 33, p.510 Much the same story was versified in the 19th century by the Mexican fabulist Jose Rosas Moreno, then in turn translated in a condensed version by the American poet William Cullen Bryant.Story telling poems, ed. Frances Jenkins Olcott, New York and Boston 1913, p.40 A different fable appeared in prose in Robert Dodsley's Select Fables of Esop (1764). This, however, was an adaptation of the fable of The Gourd and the Palm-tree and appeared in the book's third section of 'modern fables'.Fable 31 There the pert vine refused the elm's proposal and boasted of being able to rely on its own resources. The elm replies to the 'poor infatuated shrub' that misapplication of its resources will soon bring about its downfall. The text was reissued in a 1776 edition of Dodsley's work illustrated by Thomas Bewick and again in John Brocket's Select Fables (Newcastle 1820), also with Bewick's woodcut.Google Books References Category:Fables Category:Works about marriage Category:Fictional trees Category:Literary duos ","title":"The Elm and the Vine"},{"id":"34538024","text":"Holger Glandorf (born 30 March 1983) is a German retired handball player.

The Maestro concept begins with a \\"great story idea\\" that is generated through collaborative idea-group meetings to shape stories before they are written and integrates writing, editing, photography, art, and design.Package Planning, Teamwork Can Help Turn Stories into Appealing Packages PDF The Maestro concept is not applied to all stories all the time. The concept applies only to those stories that are integrated with photographs, design elements, and infographics. It is a method designed to improve presentation of important stories through teamwork that brings the story to life and results in high impact and high readership. History The Maestro Concept was created by Leland \\"Buck\\" Ryan, director of the Citizen Kentucky Project of the Scripps Howard First Amendment Center and tenured associate professor of journalism at the University of Kentucky's School of Journalism and Telecommunications. Ryan created the concept in the early 1990s when he was an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. The inspiration for the Maestro concept came from a 1991 Poynter Institute study by Mario Garcia and Pegie Stark called \\"Eyes on the News\\". That study followed the eyes of readers (tracked actual eye movements) in three cities and discovered that readers do not read a newspaper as journalists believed. This studyEyes on the News and subsequent studies, including online publications, are used in newsrooms and classrooms today as a teaching model. The original study found that good indexing for busy readers is the key to successful publishing.good indexing The Maestro concept was developed through an \\"approach to newsroom management, organization and operation that applies W. Edwards Deming's management principles used in manufacturing to the creative process\\".The Maestro Concept, What is it? Striving for quality, in both product and management, is Deming's focal point. As a statistician, Deming noted that when management focused primarily on costs, that approach over the long run drove up costs and diminished quality. Deming found that a focus by management to increase quality while reducing costs through reduction of waste and rework lowered costs in the long run. Continual improvement of the system, and not by bits and pieces, is integral to Deming's principles. The Maestro concept debuted in April 1993 at the American Society of News Editors convention in Baltimore, Maryland. After the debut, a list of 324 newspapers in the United States, in 59 newspaper groups, and more than 50 universities and high schools showed interest in the concept by purchasing a report and video called \\"The Maestro Concept: A New Approach to Writing and Editing for the Newspaper of the Future\\". The concept's impact covers 48 states and Washington, D.C., and 16 other countries.Kentucky School of Journalism Buck Ryan A part of the international impact was a maestro workshop conducted in Hanoi for Vietnamese print and online journalists in December 2006 by Buck Ryan. In June 2010, three Russian journalism organizations invited Ryan to speak on the concept during 12 days of seminars: one was in Barnaul for the Press Development Institute-Siberia, a second in Kirov for the Russian Union of Journalists, and a third in Rostov-on-Don for the Alliance of Independent Regional Publishers of Russia. The director of the Press Development Institute-Siberia in Barnaul wrote that Ryan's \\"ideas spurred numerous projects that our regional newspapers are eager to carry out as soon as possible\\".Ryan presents Maestro Concept, 'Citizen Kentucky' project to Russian journalists, professors Then, in July, Ryan visited and served as the first journalism professor in residence as he taught two journalism courses in China for three weeks at Shanghai University. High schools have increasingly used the Maestro concept to introduce students on how a newsroom operates. The online High School Journalism Initiative has lesson plans devoted to introducing high school students to the concept. One lesson plan titled \\"conducting the orchestra: how to implement maestro\\" details how students can be taught to build small teams that are able to motivate, be productive and encourage quality throughout the school year.Conducting the 'Orchestra:' How to Implement Maestro High schools have reported that since the concept was introduced, students who have never before worked together find that they can coordinate fully reported stories and photos in one day. Besides meeting deadlines, students working together see that their story packages are of higher quality and often have a greater page presence.The maestro concept \\"The Maestro Concept\\" is presented in and is the title of Chapter Eight in the 2001 book, The Editor’s Toolbox, A Reference Guide for Beginners and Professionals. Ryan co-authored the book with Michael O'Donnell. Concept The Maestro concept is a time-management technique for story planning and newsroom organization through team collaboration to shape stories early before they are written. The central concept is trying to anticipate readers’ questions about news stories (“think like a reader”) and then answering those questions as quickly as possible through visual aspects with high-visibility points such as photos, headlines, captions and information graphics. It is a management technique to encourage collaboration across news departments and ensure that quality work in a story package comes not from the traditional method of an assembly line, but from teamwork and good time- management from all players working on the story. The Maestro concept has five points: # Idea-group meetings: meeting of team members to brainstorm story ideas # The importance of coaching writers: editors act as the \\"maestro\\" to lead writers through story development # The challenges of hurdling newsroom traditions: avoid the \\"assembly line\\" approach to publication in favour of holistic, reader-focused writing # The maestro session in action: a short teamwork exercise to draft the presentation of a story, consisting of three parts - thinking like a reader, picturing the layout, and combining the work of all team members # A lesson in critiquing: \\"maestro\\" conducts follow-ups to the story to review the process and its impact Four-graph approach inverted pyramid technique of journalism writing Inverted pyramid inverted technique of journalism writing The four-graph approach to writing, editing, photography, and design is meant to efficiently create an article designed for the reader. The design is partly based on the findings in the \\"Eyes on the News\\" study that found readers typically look at photos first, headlines second, captions third, and text fourth. The goal of this approach is to engage the readers by presenting the primary factual information. #Who? A photo or illustration shows the readers. #What? A headline quickly gives reason to the visual. #When and Where? A caption to further engage readers. #The lead follows and eases the reader into the rest of story, summarizing in an inverted pyramid technique the who-what-when-where of journalism writing.

It is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the District of Columbia area. History A USSS Uniformed Division policeman near the White House in 2012. A 2013 Ford Police Interceptor of the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division is pictured outside the White House in Washington, D.C., in July 2013. A U.S. Secret Service \\"counter-sniper\\" marksman on top of the White House's roof, armed with a sniper rifle. thumb Established in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977. With more than 1,300 officers as of 2010, the Uniformed Division is responsible for security at the White House Complex; the vice president's residence; the Department of the Treasury (as part of the White House Complex); and foreign diplomatic missions in the District of Columbia, area. Uniformed Division officers carry out their protective responsibilities through a network of fixed security posts, foot, bicycle, vehicular and motorcycle patrols. The Uniformed Division has three branches: the White House Branch, the Foreign Missions Branch, and the Naval Observatory Branch. Together they provide protection for the following: the president, vice president, and their immediate families; presidential candidates; the White House Complex; the Vice President's Residence; the main Treasury Department building and its annex facility; and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Officers are responsible for providing additional support to the Secret Service's protective mission through the following special support groups: ; Counter Sniper Team (CS): Created in 1971, the Counter Sniper Team's purpose is to provide specialized protective support to defend against long-range threats to Secret Service protectees. ; Canine Explosives Detection Unit (K-9): Created in 1976, the mission of the K-9 unit is to provide skilled and specialized explosives detection support to protective efforts involving Secret Service protectees. ; Emergency Response Team (ERT): Formed in 1992, ERT's primary mission is to provide tactical response to unlawful intrusions and other protective challenges related to the White House and its grounds. ERT personnel receive specialized, advanced training and must maintain a high level of physical and operational proficiency. Officers assigned to CS, ERT, and K9, are designated \\"Technicians\\" to recognize their advanced training. Today these units are part of the agency's Special Operations Division. The Magnetometer Support Unit: Formed to ensure that all persons entering secure areas occupied by Secret Service protectees are unarmed, the Secret Service began relying on magnetometer (metal detector) support by Uniformed Division officers to augment its protective efforts away from the White House following the attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. The Secret Service Uniformed Division's statutory authority is set out in Title 18, §3056A of the U.S. Code. =Ranks= Uniformed Division ranks, set out in the salary schedule in Title 5, § 10203 of the United States Code, are as follows: * Director Of the United States Secret Service * Deputy Director of the United States Secret Service * Chief Operating Officer * Special Agent In-Charge * Special Agent * Senior Agent * Agent * Agent In Training * Passed Applicant =Current weapons= Like all other agents the sidearm is the SIG Sauer P229 (SIG Sauer P226) in .357 SIG Officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the FN P90 submachine gun, the 9mm Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun.Jones, Richard D. Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009/2010. Jane's Information Group; 35th edition (January 27, 2009). . The continued use of the MP5 remains a source of controversy as many other federal agencies have moved away from submachine guns altogether and replaced them with automatic rifles. As a non-lethal option, Special Agents, Special Officers, and Uniformed Division Officers are armed with the ASP 16” expandable baton, and Uniform Division officers also carry pepper spray. Units assigned to the Special Operations Division carry a variety of non-standard weapons. The Counter Assault Team (CAT) and the Emergency Response Team (ERT) are both issued the 5.56mm Knight's Armament Company SR-16 CQB rifle. CAT also uses 12 gauge Remington 870 MCS breaching shotguns. Uniformed Division technicians assigned to the Counter Sniper (CS) team use custom built .300 Winchester Magnum-chambered bolt-action rifles referred to as JARs (\\"Just Another Rifle\\"). These rifles use Remington 700 actions in Accuracy International stocks with Schmidt & Bender optics. CS technicians also use the 7.62mm KAC SR-25/Mk11 Mod 0 semi-automatic sniper rifle with a Trijicon 5.5× ACOG optic.

Plot Ten-year-old Jimbo Farrar is a gifted child who is misunderstood and regularly beaten by his parents. One day he is badly beaten by his father while his mother cheers him on, and Jimbo gets carried away by his anger and loses control of his abilities. When he wakes, he finds his mother's body on the floor, as she had been beaten to death by his father, who then hanged himself, all under the mental control of Jimbo. He is then sent away to a mental hospital, where Jimbo is visited by multi-billionaire Charles Killian, who decides to take him under his wing to help him control his abilities. Twenty years later, Jimbo has become a brilliant researcher in the Killian Foundation for Gifted Children, married to Ann with whom they are due to have a child. Jimbo has only one goal: to find young children who, like him, possess supernatural powers. Thus, he created an extremely complex online game \\"The Game\\" in the hopes that he'll be able to identify any such people around the United States. One night, five unrelated teenagers pass the game and hack Jimbo's computer. In desperation, Jimbo shuts his computer down and restarts it, only to find a message on his screen with the words: \\"Where Are You?\\". Jimbo immediately sets out to find them and bring them to the Foundation, but on his return he learns of the death of Killian. The Foundation therefore passes onto Melanie, Killian's daughter, who plans with Jenkins - her second-in-command - to end Jimbo's game and instead work on a TV show. In order to save the game - and the possibility of locating more \\"Prodigies\\" - Jimbo has the idea of combining the ideas: create a large-scale televised competition to reveal future geniuses. The show, American Genius, is launched, and five teenagers are announced as participants - hand-picked by Jimbo, having met and identified them as \\"Prodigies\\": Gil, an abused child who was like Jimbo when he was a child but darker; Liza, a young girl trained to be a top model; Lee, a young Asian immigrant who helps her parents in their trade; Harry, an African- American whose mother wastes all her money in gambling; and Sammy, the only son of a wealthy family and physical ungrateful. The five are identified immediately and Jimbo arranges to meet with them in secret in Central Park. No sooner are the teenagers gathered than two thugs assault and rape Liza. Jimbo, however, is not there: he has just learned that Ann is pregnant. He learns of the teenagers' situation too late and, by the time he arrives at the park, Liza is missing and the other four are on the floor, unconscious. However, through Liza's agony while she is being raped, her pain is telepathically extended to the other four teenagers and Jimbo, who unconsciously drive out the thugs using mind-controlling abilities of their own. As soon as Jimbo recovers his senses, he hurries to Liza and finds her in a coma. The next day he learns that Melanie wants to cover up the crime, in order to preserve the TV show, by claiming Liza was injured by a hit-and-run driver. Furious, Jimbo violently demands an explanation, and his anger almost makes him lose control of his abilities and as a result was fired from the Killian Foundation. After that, he vows to protect the other four, and locks himself away in his office with his computer, afraid because of how he had almost lost control like in the day of the death of his parents. Meanwhile, under the leadership of Gil, the five teenagers infiltrate the archives of the Killian group, where they find video recordings of Jimbo during his sessions in the mental hospital. Here he talks about his feelings of isolation caused by his supernatural abilities, as well as the possibility of others like him (even Charles Killian) being out there. The mention of him bringing them all together to avenge themselves for all the years of mistreatment entices Gil, Sammy, Lee and Harry to bring justice upon Liza's attackers, which they do by brutally killing them as well as the officer, who helped cover up the crime, and his wife using their powers. When Jimbo learns of this, he is very alarmed. Furthermore, Melanie refuses to recognize the truth if only to let the TV show continue, Meanwhile the teenagers are demanding justice. However, one evening, as he tries to reason with the teenagers (who are now murderers), they turn against him. Doubting his trust, they put him to the test by ordering him to kill Jenkins. but Jimbo says \\"No!\\", So the teenagers go on to make Jenkins beat up Jimbo (once again with their abilities) and kill Jenkins, then frame Jimbo for his murder. Although Jimbo initially attempts to explain to the policemen the truth about his and the teenagers' superpowers, but starts hallucinating when Gil and Lee tries to make him kill the Lieutenant who interrogating him, and then we see flashbacks of the four teenagers avenging Liza by killing Lorenzo, McKenzie, his wife and Jenkins and sees flashbacks of him being beating up by his parents until he uses his mental powers to kill them. As young Jimbo watches sadly as his father commits suicide with his own belt, After that, we later learn why Jimbo refuses to use his powers against or kill Jenkins when the four teenagers tell him to do, After killing a sparrow in a mental hospital, Killian tells Jim never use his powers again to kill or touch any living things. After that the policemen don't believe him, particularly due his supposed history of having schizophrenia. Jimbo eventually relents and is sent to prison, where he is kept under surveillance. In the meantime, Gil, Harry, Lee and Sammy make plans for causing large-scale destruction upon the United States, under the belief that this will exact justice for all the pain they had been subject to in the past. Shortly afterwards, Liza comes out of her coma, and Ann visits her to ask her for help, for she now knows of Jimbo's abilities from the police interview, as well as the teenagers' plans to infiltrate the White House to launch nuclear weapons. However, Ann angers Liza, who loses control of her powers and almost kills Ann's baby. In a desperate attempt to prevent the imminent destruction the other teenagers plan on causing, Ann reluctantly seeks help from Melanie, the organiser of the final of American Genius, which will take place in the White House, include the four teenagers plus another fifth contestant named Justin, and be attended by the President of the United States. When Jimbo learns of Liza harming Ann, he uses his powers to break free from prison and joins Liza to reach the other teenagers, as well as Melanie and Ann, at the White House. On site, when she and Jimbo are attempting to sneak into the White House, they are halted by guards and Liza uses her powers for the two of them to escape. This triggering an alarm and initiates a security procedure where everybody in the Oval Office (including the finalists of American Genius) must get to safety in a security bunker. But once inside and all exits are sealed, the four gifted teenagers manipulate the soldiers and bodyguards into killing each other, and Melanie is shot dead under Gil's will. Gil then begins the attacks by launching a nuke at Killian University, where Jimbo and Killian worked. Ann's life is spared when Sammy raises the possibility that her child, being Jimbo's as well, might also be a \\"golden child\\". Jimbo eventually arrives at the bunker with Liza, where he learns that Gil is the one leading the group into attacking the US. A fight ensues where Gil attacks Ann and Jimbo fights to protect her, until the fifth contestant Justin fires a gun at Gil when Jimbo is at the verge of being killed. But Jimbo, anticipating the bullet, pushes Gil away and instead receives the bullet in his heart. While Jimbo lies in Ann's arms, dying, Gil horribly slaps Liza for her refusal to cooperate with him, which brings Harry to his senses and convinces his friends to stop all the madness of attacking and killing masses of people across the United States. And so, while one controls Gil in order to prevent him from stopping them, Harry cancels the nuclear attack, saving Killian University by seconds. Shortly afterwards, Jimbo takes his final breath. Three months later, Killian's company has gone bankrupt. Ann, still pregnant, receives a package containing Jimbo's phone (which he had lost in the fight at the White House), which has a final video message from Jimbo. Ann does not know it was left by Liza, who has disappeared from the radar along with Harry, Sammy, Lee and Gil. Liza, Harry, Sammy and Lee now search for other gifted people like themselves, using Jimbo's game, but Gil now continues with his journey on his own, and it seems that he is plotting dark schemes.

It currently holds a 0% 'rotten' critical score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 4 reviews (as of September 2015), indicating generally negative reviews. Linda Barnard of Toronto Star wrote 'too violent for youngsters and so poorly written it won't engage an older audience, it seems to be targeted towards youthful nerds nursing overwhelming revenge fantasies', Liz Braun of Jam! Movies wrote 'you wouldn't expose a teenager to this, that's for sure, but the storytelling is so ham-handed that few adults would sit still for it' and Dave McGinn of Globe and Mail wrote 'The Prodigies pulls together a lot of familiar tropes from superhero movies without adding anything new or compelling to the genre'.

The initiative was conceived as part of Beecham's campaign to foster musical life during World War I, after the forced closure of the Covent Garden Opera Company, where the conductor had been mounting opera seasons. Conveniently, Beecham's project was able to draw on many former members of the Edinburgh based Denhof Opera Company, thereby effectively continuing the earlier company's work.Kennedy, Michael and Bourne, Joyce (1996). \\"Denhof Opera Company\\".

Supported financially by Beecham's father, Joseph, the new outfit quickly turned into a successful touring company with casts of mainly British singers, including Frank Mullings, who was entrusted with some of the key lead roles. Beecham's company provided the wartime public with opera performances both around the provinces and in London (at the Drury Lane, Shaftesbury and Aldwych theatres), even during the 1917 Zeppelin raids. The repertoire was extensive, and included productions of works as ambitious as Boris Godunov (in French) and Tristan und Isolde. Although Beecham had intended the company to be a permanent venture, it was disbanded in 1920 when financial problems over buying the Bedford Estate forced him to withdraw temporarily from the music scene. Many of the performers joined the British National Opera Company (1922–1929), a replacement venture which bought the entire assets of the Beecham company, comprising the scenery, costumes, scores, instruments and performing rights for 48 operas.The Times, 27 September 1921, p. 12 See also *Thomas Beecham, 1910 1920 *British National Opera Company References External links *Sir Thomas Beecham Opera Company, 1 2 3 at historicopera.com Category:British opera companies Category:Musical groups established in 1915 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1920 Category:1915 establishments in England ","title":"Beecham Opera Company"},{"id":"34538479","text":"Shoaf Historic District is a national historic district located at Georges Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania.

His reign was characterized by an ebb and flow in hegemony over the religious centers of Nippur and Ur. Biography The titles “shepherd who makes Nippur content,” \\"mighty farmer of Ur,\\" “who restores the designs for Eridu” and “en priest for the mes, for Uruk” were used by Būr-Sîn in his standard brick inscriptions in Nippur and Isin,For example, brick CBS 8642 from Nippur and brick IM 76546 from Isin. although it seems unlikely that his rule stretched to Ur or Eridu at this time as the only inscriptions with an archaeological provenance come from the two northerly cities. A solitary tablet from Ur is dated to his first year, but this is thought to correspond to Abē-sarē’s year 11, for which several tablets attest to his reign over Ur. He was contemporary with the tail end of the reign of Abī-sarē, ca, 1841 to 1830 BC (short) and that of Sūmú-El, c. 1830 to 1801 BC (short), the kings of Larsa. This latter king’s year-names record victories over Akusum, Kazallu, Uruk (which had seceded from Isin), Lugal-Sîn, Ka-ida, Sabum, Kiš, and village of Nanna-isa, relentlessly edging north and feverish activity digging canals or filling them in, possibly to counter the measures taken by Būr-Sîn to contain him. Only nine of Būr-Sîn's own year-names are known and the sequence is uncertain. He seized control of Kisurra for a time as two year-names are found among tablets from this city, possibly following the departure of Sumu-abum the king of Babylon who “returned to his city.” The occupation was brief, however, as Sumu-El was to conquer it during his fourth year. Other year-names record Būr-Sîn's construction of fortifications, walls on the bank of the Eurphrates and a canal. A year-name of Sumu-El records “Year after the year Sumu-El has opened the palace (?) of Nippur,” whose place in this king’s sequence is unknown.

There are around five extant seals and seal impressions of his servants and scribes, three of which were excavated in Ur suggesting a fleeting late reoccupancy of this city at the end of his reign and the beginning of his successor's as coincidentally no texts from Ur bear Sumu-El's years 19 to 22 which correspond with this period.

It seems reasonable that Willem River was almost certainly named after Supercargo Willem Janszoon, the Commander of the ship Mauritius. Janszoon was captain of the Duyfken in 16051606, when part of the Gulf of Carpentaria was mapped, during the earliest documented visit to Australia by a vessel from Europe. Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht (\\"Chart of the Land of Eendracht\\") is a 1627 chart made by Hessel Gerritsz and is one of the earliest charts showing the coastline of Western Australia. The Willem River is located to the extreme left (north) end of the coastline on the chart and a closer view is provided below. 400px Is Willem River the Ashburton River? It is believed that the Willem River of 1618 is the Ashburton River in Western Australia., cited in Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht The chart shows Willems revier, besocht by 't volck van 't Schip Mauritius in Iulius A° 1618 (translated Willem's River, visited by the crew of the ship Mauritius in July 1618). The detail of the river's position on the chart backs up the claim that this is the Ashburton River, which, being at 21 degrees 40 minutes south and 114 degrees 56 east, is almost exactly the latitude shown on the chart. The chart is oriented with north to the left, showing lines of latitude from 20th parallel south to the 35th parallel south at the base of the map. The lines of latitude appear to be very accurate, matching closely known features through the length of the chart. Other factors to back up that this is the Ashburton River is that it takes almost a 90 degree turn north-east once in the mouth as shown on the chart, and the northern headland of the river mouth in reality is of the same shape as shown on the chart. However, significant changes to the river delta since 1963 alone have been observed. These changes include channel and mouth movements, and erosion and formation of spits. For example, between 1973 and 2008 the eastern spit at Entrance Point migrated eastwards by approximately . 1627 chart accuracy A note on the chart's accuracy is given by the author Heeres in 1899, from the following excerpt. > The 1627 chart is specially interesting. Gerritsz., at the time cartographer > in ordinary to the E.I.C., has \\"put together this chart of the Landt van > d'Eendracht from the journals and drawings of the Steersmen\\", which means > that he availed himself of authentic data [***]. He acquitted himself of the > task to admiration, and has given a very lucid survey of the (accidental) > discoveries made by the Dutch on the west-coast of Australia. In this chart > of 1627 the Land of d'Eendracht takes up a good deal of space. To the north > it is found bounded by the \\"Willemsrivier\\", discovered in July 1618 by the > ship Mauritius, commanded by Willem Janszoon [****]. According to the chart > this \\"river\\" is in about 21° 45' S. Lat., but there are no reliable data > concerning this point. > > [*** It is evident that he did not use all the data then available. Thus, > for instance, he left unused those furnished by the Zeewolf (No. VIII, pp. > 10 ff. below), and those of the ship Leiden (No. XV, p. 49).] > > [**** See the Documents under No IX (pp. 12f.).] What Heeres means by the sentence, According to the chart this \\"river\\" is in about 21° 45' S. Lat., but there are no reliable data concerning this point, is that in 1899 they had no reliable information about exactly what was at that latitude. Mauritius at North West Cape On 31 July 1618, the Mauritius reached North West Cape (west of Exmouth Gulf), where crew members went ashore and saw footprints; this was the closest that Europeans had yet come to making contact with indigenous Australians in Western Australia. Janszoon and Jacobszoon assumed that the cape was an island: the notion later took hold amongst mariners and cartographers, to the extent that it was named \\"Cloates Island\\" in 1720 and this misconception lingered until the 19th century. As Willem's River was also named in July it would appear that the Mauritius, which reached Bantam, Indonesia on , discovered the river on the same day that they reached North West Cape (that is, , the last day of July). The 1627 chart was based on a number of voyages, beginning with the 1616 voyage of Dirk Hartog. On that voyage Hartog named Eendrachtsland after his ship, the Eendracht meaning \\"Unity\\". Eendrachtsland is one of the earliest names given to the Australian mainland.

Background Dundee in Scotland was the home port of the Royal Navy’s 2nd Submarine Flotilla between August and October 1939. From 18 April 1940 until the end of the Second World War, Dundee was the base of the 9th Submarine Flotilla, a unique international flotilla which included crews from Poland, the Netherlands, France and Norway after those countries were invaded and occupied by the Nazi regime. Russian submarine crews also operated from Dundee during the summer of 1944. Dundee-based submarines patrolled the enemy-held coastline of mainland Europe, attacking enemy warships including the battle-cruiser Gneisenau,British National Archives file ref ADM 234 380 and the cruiser Prinz Eugen,NA: ADM 234 380 and ventured far inside the Arctic Circle to help protect convoys carrying war supplies to the Soviet Union. Enemy supply convoys were attacked, and, using intelligence provided by Bletchley Park, U boats heading for the North Atlantic convoy routes were intercepted. ’s numerous successes included sinking off Norway,NA: ADM 199 2030 and remains the only submarine ever to have sunk another - - while both boats were submerged.NA: ADM 199 2030 and ADM 199 1813 The Free French Rubis laid minefields and torpedoed enemy shipping in both Norwegian coastal waters and the Bay of Biscay, while another Free French boat, Minerve, limped back to Dundee badly damaged and leaking after being smashed into the seabed by depth charges. And, in support of the resistance in occupied Norway, agents, teams of saboteurs, weapons and supplies were landed under cover of darkness, often deep inside enemy-held fjords. Six British, Dutch, Norwegian and Russian submarines were lost while on patrol from Dundee and two hundred and ninety six British, Dutch, Free French, Norwegian and Russian sailors and commandos lost their lives, few of whom have any known grave.

It was the first design for the company by Dr. Richard Vogt and the first to feature his trademark tubular steel wing spar which doubled as the main fuel tank. Two prototypes were built but it was not ordered into production. Design Hamburger Flugzeugbau had been set up by the owners of Blohm & Voss shipbuilders to manufacture advanced all-metal aircraft. Dr. Richard Vogt had decided to adopt as a signature feature the use of a hollow welded steel tubular main wing spar, which could be filled with fuel to act as an armoured fuel tank. In other respects the design was relatively conventional.Pohlmann (1982) A conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane with nose-mounted engine and fixed spatted tailwheel undercarriage, the plane accommodated its pilot in an open cockpit above the wing aft section. The fuselage tapered sharply towards the top so that a slight bulge on either side of the cockpit was needed to make room for the pilot's shoulders. Two examples were produced, differing mainly in their engines. One was fitted with a Bramo Sh 14A radial engine and the other with an Argus As 8R in-line engine. History The Ha 136 was designed to a requirement for an advanced fighter trainer that was as difficult to fly as a frontline fighter. The aircraft first flew in the Autumn of 1934 and the fighter-like handling characteristics were confirmed.Amtmann (1998). However the RLM changed its mind and decided that advanced fighter training should be carried out on the fighter aircraft themselves. The requirement for the Ha 136 was dropped and so it never entered production.

It is available for social networks and mobile devices and was developed by Seattle-based Spry Fox. The casual game was originally released for the Amazon Kindle e-reader in 2010, and was ported to the Facebook and Google+ social networks in October 2011. It was published in January 2012 for iOS and some Android devices. It was released for Windows and Macintosh through Steam on December 6, 2012.  Gameplay  The premise of the turn- based, single-player game is that the player must build a new settlement. The game takes place on a 6×6 grid of fields on which some tiles are randomly placed. Players are given random tiles, most often grass tiles, that they must place on the grid. When three or more identical tiles adjoin, they merge into one more advanced tile at the position of the last tile placed: three grass tiles become a bush, three bushes a tree, three trees a hut, three huts a house, and so forth. Merging four or more tiles earns coins or a tile which is held in the inventory located in the sidebar. There are three special tiles: bears, crystals, and imperial bots. Bears move to a neighboring square each turn, blocking building sites until they are trapped. Ninjas act the same, except they can move to any empty square on the board. When they are trapped or an imperial bot is used on them, they turn into a gravestone. Three gravestones make a church, three churches a cathedral, and so forth. Crystals can be used as a wild card to make any match. Imperial bots remove individual tiles, or, if used on bears, turn them into gravestones. The player may keep one tile in reserve in the storehouse, usually located in the top left corner of the screen, and use it when needed. The objective of the game is to upgrade one's settlement's tiles to as high a rank as possible, earning an accordingly high score. The game ends if all fields of the grid are filled. In 2012 the Capital City feature was added to the Web-based version of the game, which acts as a home base. In the Capital City the player can select which settlement they want to go to, and also build up the Capital City itself. When Capital City tiles are earned, they are placed in the inventory. = In-game money = In Triple Town on the Web, there are two types of in-game money: coins and diamonds. Each can be purchased using real money, although coins can also be earned during gameplay. When a user first plays Triple Town, they are given several thousand coins and a small number of diamonds. In the mobile version of the game, there are only coins, not diamonds.  Reception  Triple Town received positive reviews. Reviewers praised the game's innovative extensions of the match-three mechanic as well as its strategic depth, unusual for a casual game, which requires players to plan several moves ahead in order to be successful. Criticism focused on the game's limited content and its implementation of the freemium business model: while the game is free, it comes with a limited number of turns. Once these are used up, they regenerate slowly, or may be purchased with in-game or real money. The turn limit can be permanently removed with a one-time payment. Casual gaming website Gamezebo named Triple Town the best Facebook game of 2011, and second-best game of the year 2011. Triple Town was also Edge's runner-up for indie game of the year 2011, and Gamasutra's runner-up for best social game of 2011.  Copyright infringement dispute  In January 2012, Spry Fox filed a lawsuit against Lolapps and 6Waves LLC. The complaint alleges that these companies published, in violation of Spry Fox's copyright, a yeti-themed game Yeti Town that is substantially a copy of Triple Town. LOLAPPS and 6Waves had previously denied these allegations. A US court noted that while the game mechanics have little protection, the style and expression of the clone are too similar to Triple Town, and thus denied 6Waves' motion to dismiss Spry Fox's infringement claim.There is 'substantial similarity' between Triple Town and Yeti Town - U.S. court In October 2012 they reached a settlement resulting in the transfer of Yeti Town's copyright to Spry Fox.Spry Fox settlement with 6waves  References   External links  *Official website Category:Match 3 games Category:Browser games Category:City-building games Category:IOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Facebook games Category:Casual games Category:2010 video games Category:Indie video games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Single- player video games ","title":"Triple Town"},{"id":"34538743","text":"254 Squadron, also known as the Midland Squadron (), is a former unit of the Israeli Air Force.  History  254 Squadron was formed in April 1980 at Hatzor to operate the IAI Kfir C-1. These had served with 109 Squadron which had begun to equip with the C-2 variant. Manned mainly by reserve pilots, 254 Squadron was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Giora Epstein, Israel's highest scoring fighter ace, and a reserve pilot himself. A year later the squadron received an additional aircraft type, the Dassault Mirage III. The Mirage had once stood at the vanguard of the Israeli Air Force, claiming over 280 aerial victories to its name. By the late 1970s, however, these veteran French aircraft were superseded by the IAF's next generation of fighter aircraft, the American F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. The first squadron to re-equip with the Falcon, 117 Squadron, had in 1979 transferred its former mounts to 253 Squadron at Eitam, and the latter was soon slated to receive the Falcon as well. Coinciding with Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula following the Camp David Accords, and in order to continue operating the Mirages pending their sale to Argentina, when 253 left Eitam for Ramon in late 1981, the remaining 22 Mirages made their way to Hatzor to join 254 Squadron. 254 Squadron was operating both types when the 1982 Lebanon War broke out,Norton 2004, p. 45 during which the Mirages continued flying combat air patrols. On at least one occasion they were even vectored towards enemy aircraft, but these were soon dispatched by F-15s also on the scene. They were soon thereafter retired. In 1984, as more Kfir C-2s were rolling off the production line, the Kfir C-1s were leased to the US military and 254 Squadron was deactivated.  Markings  The 254 Squadron badge was a stylized bird over the outline of Israel's coastline. Its Kfirs wore the standard four-tone camouflague used by all IAF delta-winged fighters at the time, though usually without the black identifications triangles common on the Mirages and IAI Neshers. They also carried serials in the 700 range, which were applied on the tail and nose gear. While with 253 Squadron, the Mirages had received blue rudders with two white chevrons separated by a black band. At the end of their tenure with the squadron some aircraft were seen with the top chevron changed to red. When the Mirages joined 254 Squadron, not only were the different rudders maintained, but both were applied to the Kfirs as well. The different markings may have been an attempt at disinformation, meant to mislead uninformed observers.

Perlorian photographs feature real cats dressed in clothing and arranged in cat-sized dioramas so they appear to be doing human activities such as camping, going to school, or playing in a rock band. Some of the first Perlorian images featured cats involved in juvenile delinquent behaviour, such as smoking in a bathroom and being in a motorcycle gang. At its height in the early 1980s, Perlorian cats appeared on over 500 different pieces of merchandise.  Nameneko: a Japanese fad  Photographer Satoru Tsuda originally didn't like cats, but in 1979 he took in four tiny kittens he'd found abandoned at a dry cleaner's shop near his home, taking care of them just as a mother cat would. After a few months he noticed one of them (\\"Matakichi\\", named after the dry cleaning business in which he was found) playing with some doll clothes, and the idea for Perlorian was born. The first item was a poster of Matakichi dressed as a motorcycle gang member with the slogan \\"All Japan Fast Feline Federation — You Won’t Lick Us!\\". The poster went on to sell 8 million copies and launched a craze for more items. Hundreds of items would be released in a short time, including novelty fake IDs, underwear, and a handheld video game made by Bandai. Like most fads the initial craze dissipated quickly, but Namennayo items are still being produced and in 2010 the brand celebrated its 30th anniversary.  Perlorian in America  Marketed as Perlorian in the United States, Tsuda's cat merchandise was popular for a time in the mid-1980s but never reached the heights it had in Japan. Perlorian items for the US market included a series of 4 children's books with text by Suzanne Green and a 1983 set of trading cards by Topps. Internet humour site I-Mockery named the card set among the worst trading cards ever created. Fotofolio published another wave of Perlorian postcards circa 2004.

The play takes its title from the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty. The plot concerns an elderly Irish woman, Kate Houlihan, who dies and leaves her fortune equally between her two nephews Michael and William. Michael is a Southern Irish Republican and William is a Northern Irish Orangeman. To inherit the fortune Michael and William must spend a month in peace in Kate's cottage. The two men find they are unable to live in peace so Kate's solicitor, Mr Applebloom, decides to partition the cottage. Much of the humour is derived from the two men trying to at first compete and then co- operate in the situation. For example, a radio is on one side of the cottage but the electrical socket is on the other. The play was first produced at the Abbey Theatre on 20 March 1961. The play came to the attention of Northern Irish actor and comedian James Young who decided to run it at the Ulster Group Theatre, Belfast. McDonnell rewrote the play for Young, including the addition of a new character, an Englishman who did not understand Irish politics. The rewritten version was first produced at the Group Theatre on 24 October 1961. The Abbey Theatre version of the play was published by James Duffy & Co. Ltd. in 1975, while a typescript of the Group Theatre version was also available from the author and has been revived over the years by a number of amateur dramatics groups. Plot =Act I= Scene one Kate Houlihan, a frail aged woman, lives in a cottage somewhere in the south of Ireland and is looked after by her housekeeper Julia Finegan. Kate is convinced she is dying and reminisces about her family. She has two cousins, Michael Maloney from Kildare and William \\"Willie\\" MacStay is from Sandy Row in Belfast. Kate has sent for her cousins in the hope of seeing them before she dies. Kate's solicitor, Charles Applebloom, has traced William's whereabouts. Kate intends to include both cousins in her Will and heal the breach between her cousins. Michael arrives at the cottage and is reluctant to the situation. Soon Willie arrives and admits that he did not want to come at first, but Applebloom's telegram told him that it might be to his advantage. Michael and Willie engage in a point scoring exchange by insulting each other's country and politics. The exchange takes a lot out of Kate and she goes to her bedroom, aided by Julia and Michael, to rest. Applebloom confides in Willie that he is worried that if Kate includes him in her will it will result in violence. Willie assures Applebloom that he is confident that Kate will not leave him anything saying that he knows \\"how the Roman Catholic Church operates up here.\\" Applebloom says that this is not the case, at which point Father Kelly arrives. Scene two It is several months later and Kate has died. Michael, Willie and Julia are in mourning at the cottage and Julia is preparing to pack Kate's possessions away. Mr Applebloom arrives and explains the provisions of Kate's will. Kate leaves a small amount to Julia with the remainder of her money and property to be divided equally between her two cousins. However, the men will not get their share unless they live peacefully in the cottage for one month. If one of the men fails then his share will go to the other and if both fail the money will be given to charity. Julia will also get a further inheritance if she acts as housekeeper for both men during this period, if she does not attend both the men this additional share will be donated to Willie's Orange Lodge. Mr Applebloom leaves to allow the others time to consider the proposal. Willie states that a picture of Éamon de Valera will have to be removed from the wall as he considers it provoking. The two men start to struggle, at which point Mr Applebloom returns. Michael explains the situation to Mr Applebloom who realises that the only way to stop the fighting from taking place is to keep both men apart. Mr Applebloom draws a line down the middle of the room, in effect partitioning the cottage. Michael must stay on one side and Willie the other. This appears to solve the situation. However, when Michael requests Willie hand over the picture of De Valera, Willie states that it belongs in his half of the cottage and he doesn't want Michael to have it and hangs it up again facing the wall. Julia prepares to make tea for Michael but, as the cutlery and table cloth are on Michael's side of the room she only lays out the things in his side of the table. When she goes to the dresser to get cups, however, Willie tells her that it is in his side of the room and she must not transport them across the border. Julia leaves to get Kate's good cups from storage. Michael turns on the radio, which is announcing the news. Willie becomes interested as the results of the Northern Irish football teams' matches are announced. Michael lets Willie hear the results up to the point when his favourite team, Linfield, is being announced, turning off the radio when their opponent's scores are about to be read. In retaliation, Willie switches off the lights to the room just as Julia returns with the cups, causing her to trip and shatter them. =Act II= It is the following evening. Willie has brought tools into the cottage and plans to build himself a fireplace, when Julia rushes in to stop him, thinking he plans to murder Michael. Michael tells Julia to let Willie go ahead as he has sent for Applebloom. Michael and Julia are outraged when Willie says that he has a woman solicitor assuming that he means she is a prostitute. Gerry O'Neill, a Northern Irish journalist arrives. Julia thinks he is one of the B Specials and goes to fetch her brother, while Willie assumes that he is a fellow loyalist. Gerry reveals that he is a Nationalist and thinks of all Ireland as his home. He intends to write a story concerning the situation in the cottage. Applebloom arrives, angered at continually having to mediate between Michael and Willie. Gerry leaves and Applebloom cautions the men to live in peace or they will not inherit their share of the fortune. Willie tells him about his own solicitor and Michael storms out of the cottage to go to the pub. Willie's solicitor, Mary MacMillan, arrives. She sees the problem of Michael and Willie as a simple one; Michael wants De Valera's picture and Willie wants an access to the facilities in Michael's half of the cottage. She proposes a solution that she calls an “international trade agreement”. Willie agrees to Mary's proposal and goes to fetch Michael. Gerry returns and decides to wait for Michael. He states that while he considers himself a nationalist he approves of the real Irish border as without it there \\"wouldn't be a spark of national spirit left in the country.\\" Julia informs Mary that Michael and Willie are brawling in the pub. She says that the fight was started when Willie came into the pub and told Michael that a woman solicitor was looking for him. Mr Applebloom is pleased about the fight as he believes it will disqualify both from their inheritance. Mary informs him, however, that he men only had to live peacefully inside the cottage and not outside. Michael returns badly beaten and bandaged, followed by Willie who is even more badly beaten. The local Garda Síochána officer, Sergeant Reilly arrives. Reilly states that he wants to keep the peace without too much trouble. Mary assures him there will be no trouble between the men and tells him about the \\"trade agreement\\" she has proposed. Reilly is keen to see the agreement go ahead and convinces everyone to discuss the matter civilly. Mary convinces Willie to give De Valera's picture to Michael and in return Michael agrees to let Willie use the facilities in his half of the cottage. Applebloom warns the two that if there is any more trouble they will not get any of Kate's money and he too departs. Julia leaves to get some food to make the men their dinner. Gerry is angry at the situation and thinks that Willie should be under arrest for attempted murder. Mary, Michael and Willie try to calm him down but he only gets angrier. Gerry is enraged that Michael is not standing up more to Willie while Willie defends Michael against Gerry's attempts to provoke him. During the course of their arguments Willie and Michael involuntarily cross into the other territory. Gerry laughs at the men and leaves, followed by Mary. Michael and Willie realise where they are standing and awkwardly move back into their own half of the cottage. Michael turns the radio on and the two men sit in silence listening to Home! Sweet Home!. =Act III= Scene one It is two weeks later, De Valera's picture hangs on Michael's side of the cottage and a picture of The Queen hangs in Willie's half. Michael and Willie are more comfortable going into the other's territory and Julia is more pleasant to Willie. Willie says that he can't understand why Julia did not get married and that the men \\"up here are daft.\\" Julia coyly says to Willie that she was waiting for the right man to come along. Father Kelly arrives at the cottage. At first Julia and Willie assume that Father Kelly wants to convert Willie to Catholicism. But Father Kelly explains that he came to discuss a Tidy Towns competition. Julia is enraged at this and leaves. Michael enters and Father Kelly puts the idea of painting the cottage to him, stating that Kate once had the cottage painted a shade of pale green. Michael likes the idea but states he does not like pale colours and suggests a strong shade of green. Willie suggests that a pale red would be a much better colour. Father Kelly tries to calm the men as each increasingly argues for his preferred colour eventually telling the men to forget it and leaving. Mary arrives and suggests that they paint the cottage white. The two men agree and Michael leaves to buy paint. Mary tells Willie that when the men leave the cottage she would like to buy it. Willie agrees but Mary states that it is not that simple as that as Willie can only sell half the property and that Michael must agree to sell the other half. Gerry arrives and tells Willie that he has seen Michael heading to buy green paint. Willie then runs out to stop Michael. Gerry admits that it was a trick so that he could be alone with her. He apologises for kissing her the previous evening. The two blame it on romantic music and alcohol. They agree to meet that evening to discuss their feelings. Mr Applebloom informs Michael that he has received an offer for the cottage, however, the buyer does not want to be identified. Willie refuses to give Mr Applebloom his authority to sell the cottage as he does not want to go back on his word and refuses to tell Mr Applebloom who his buyer is. Michael is angered and refuses to go back on his word to sell to Mr Applebloom's client. The two refuse to compromise and Mr Applebloom loses his temper with the situation. Scene two It is two weeks later. Applebloom tells Julia that he has heard rumours that she secretly has some regard for Willie. Applebloom is disappointed that Michael and Willie can't reach an agreement to sell the house. Michael is adamant that he will only sell to Applebloom's client and wonders if there is a way to force Willie to sell. Michael wants to have a farewell drink with Gerry and asks Applebloom to join them. Applebloom assumes that Michael knew that it was his birthday but cannot join him as he wants to talk to Willie. Michael agrees to drink his health anyway and leaves. Julia returns with Willie and continues to defend him, but he is oblivious to her true intentions. Julia is angered by this and leaves. Applebloom starts to act drunk, due to it his having had a birthday drink, and he tells Willie that love is more important than politics. The two share a drink and Willie admits to having met and falling love with a woman called Martha who died weeks before they were due to be married. He admits that sometimes he can find no sense in squabbling and fighting. Mr Applebloom asks Willie if he will shake Michael's hand before he goes. Willie states he will shake Michael's hand and \\"ask King Billy to look the other road.\\" Mary arrives and Applebloom worries that he will be remembered in the same league as David Lloyd George for having divided the cottage. A taxi arrives to take Michael to the train station. Applebloom convinces the cousins to shake hands before they depart. Each man admits that they are opposed to what the other stands for but that both points of view are equally important. Michael and Willie then depart in the same taxi for the station. Applebloom complains that the cottage was meant to bring the men together, but instead they have split it in half. Gerry tells Mary that when Applebloom drew the line on the floor he didn't think it would be so hard to rub it out again. Gerry says \\"I believe there's some difficulty in getting Humpty Dumpty together again.\\" Mary tells Gerry that she has been trying to buy the cottage but because of the situation she is only able to buy half. Gerry reveals that he is Applebloom's secret buyer and together he and Mary would be able to buy the cottage and get married. Applebloom staggers in and overhears the conversation and joyfully starts to sing A Nation Once Again. Michael returns and states that he has missed his train and that the next one isn't until the following day. With the others Michael raises a glass of whiskey and agrees to \\"drink to Willie MacStay my cousin. NOT to Willie MacStay the Orangeman.\\" At that moment Willie arrives and states that he has missed his train because the I.R.A. has blown up the train line. Michael and Willie start to argue and again the situation descends into a brawl. At first Mary and Applebloom try to calm the situation, but Gerry takes Mary out to the town to buy her an engagement ring. Gerry states that the two men \\"have as much right to be happy as we have.\\" The two continue to argue as Applebloom begs them to stop. Group Theatre differences When the play was transferred from Dublin to Belfast, star James Young suggested a number of changes to the author. The plot and most of the dialogue remained the same, but a number of minor changes to the script altered the tone to focus more on the comedy of the situation. Young also suggested the introduction of an English character that knew nothing about Irish politics. This character was Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Jones- Jackson, a stereotypical upper class Englishman; very polite and obliging and also dim-witted. The first major change occurs during Act I Scene two just after the cottage has been partitioned and Julia has returned. At this point Reggie enters. His car has broken down and he wants to sit and wait until a mechanic arrives. While Reggie is waiting that Julia offers to make him tea. The scene plays out largely as in the original version, except both Willie and Michael share their own political views with Reggie, who amiably agrees to everything despite finding the situation in the cottage unbelievable. Reggie returns in Act II, just after the departure of Sergeant Reilly. He arrives with a parcel of new china to thank the men for letting him wait for the mechanic. The scene plays out as before except Reggie continually moves the parcel around the room to avoid it shattering as the men argue and bang the table. When Gerry leaves, Reggie tries to congratulate Michael and Willie for their handling of the situation. In doing so he congratulates the men for being British, causing Michael to become angry and he and Willie chase Reggie from the cottage. The Act then ends the same as the original version. In Act III Scene one Reggie appears when Michael and Willie argue over whom to sell the cottage to. He apologises for causing a disruption on his previous visit and says he came to see Mr Applebloom. He states his desire to buy the cottage as a holiday home for his family. Mr Applebloom and Willie consider it a solution to the problem but Michael does not want to sell to an Englishman. The scene ends with the same deadlock between Michael and Willie. The final scene is played out in the same way as the original version, except that Willie's story about Martha is omitted. Reggie enters at the point after Michael and Willie have left for the station. Michael returns and the scene plays out as before, with Reggie occasionally interjecting into the conversation and also attempting to aid Mr Applebloom in stopping Michael and Willie fighting with each other as the play ends.

In the subsequent semester of broadcasting, the controversial show was absent from the schedule of programming. In 2019, the show \\"Up Late with Dave\\" featured an interview with John Connors to discuss the travelling community in Ireland.

In 2000, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Work in print journalism Gan received a degree in political economy from an Australian university in 1989. He began his journalistic career in print, as a freelancer for a Hong Kong-based newspaper. In 1991, he covered the Gulf War from Baghdad. In 1994, he returned to Malaysia, where he became a reporter for the new Malaysian daily The Sun. There he struggled against both government regulation and the self-censorship of The Sun's editors. In 1995, he led a team of reporters that discovered that 59 inmates, primarily Bangladeshis, had died in the Semenyih immigration detention camp of the preventable diseases typhoid and beriberi. When Gan's editors refused to publish the story for fear of government reprisal, Gan passed the information to the immigrant rights organisation Tenaganita. Tenaganita publicised the reporters' findings, and its director, Irene Fernandez, was subsequently threatened with imprisonment for \\"publishing false news\\". Fernandez's trials and appeals from the case would last thirteen years, ending in her 2008 acquittal by the Kuala Lumpur Criminal High Court. In 1996, Gan was arrested, along with four other reporters, at the 1996 Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor. During the five days he spent in jail, he was named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. After his release, he wrote a column protesting his arrest and treatment, but his editors refused to publish it. Gan resigned in protest, going on to write editorials for the English-language Thai daily The Nation. Malaysiakini Though Malaysian law had provided for strict government controls on print media since 1984, the Malaysia Multimedia Super Corridor, an initiative to encourage technological development in Malaysia, was launched in 1995. A founding principle of the project was that government censorship of the Internet would not be permitted. Seeing a loophole, Gan and colleague Premesh Chandran decided to found an online news resource that would be free of the controls placed on print media. The pair founded Malaysiakini.com in November 1999, with a staff of four other journalists and a starting budget of $100,000. Gan served as its editor-in- chief. For its first story, Malaysiakini posted a report on 20 November criticising the practices of Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia's largest-circulation Chinese-language newspaper. Sin Chew Daily had doctored a photograph of Malaysia's ruling party to remove Anwar Ibrahim, who had recently been imprisoned for corruption. According to BBC News, the Malaysiakini report led to \\"worldwide infamy\\" for Sin Chew Daily, and the newspaper later issued a public apology. In April 2001, Malaysiakini made news again when it discovered and reported the secret detention of 10 political activists. Within a year, the site had nearly 100,000 visitors a day, making it one of the most popular news sites in Malaysia; it had also expanded to a full-time staff of twelve. In January 2012, Alexa Internet ranked it as the 14th most popular website in the country. However, attracting advertising was often a challenge for the website, which Gan blamed on collusion between Malaysian politicians and businesspeople. Government responses to Malaysiakini Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad described the Malaysiakini staff as \\"traitors\\" and suggested that the paper was funded by financier George Soros, whose currency speculation the Prime Minister blamed for the 1997 Asian financial crisis that had devastated Malaysia's economy. In a 2002 article in Nieman Reports, Gan stated that Malaysiakini was repeatedly hacked during the first years of its existence. Citing a government statement to launch \\"missiles\\" at opposition websites, Gan speculated that the Malaysian government was behind the cyberattacks. The website underwent further cyber-attacks in April and July 2011, coinciding with an election in Sarawak and the pro-electoral reform Bersih 2.0 rally; again Gan alleged that the government was responsible. On 20 January 2003, the Malaysiakini office was raided by police, who confiscated the website's servers and 15 newsroom computers, an estimated RM150,000 ($40,000 USD) in equipment. The raid followed a call by the youth wing of the right-wing political party UMNO to investigate the site for sedition after it carried a letter criticising the government's pro-Malay quotas in hiring and scholarships. The website was able to go back online ten hours after the raid. Awards and recognition Gan was awarded one of the 2000 CPJ International Press Freedom Awards, along with Željko Kopanja of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Modeste Mutinga of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mashallah Shamsolvaezin of Iran. The CPJ describes the award as \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". In July 2001, Businessweek named Gan one of the \\"Stars of Asia\\" in the category \\"Opinion Shapers\\". Later that year, Malaysiakini won a Free Media Pioneer award from the International Press Institute.

Das Buddhistische Haus (English: Berlin Buddhist Vihara, literally the Buddhist house) is a Theravada Buddhist temple complex (Vihara) in Frohnau, Berlin, Germany. It is considered to be the oldest and largest Theravada Buddhist center in Europe and has been declared a National Heritage site. History The main building was designed by the architect Max Meyer for Paul Dahlke, a German physician who had undertaken a number of trips to Ceylon prior to World War I and became a Buddhist. It incorporates elements of Sri Lankan ( Sinhalese) Buddhist architecture and culture and was completed in 1924.buddha-heute.de: Das \\"Buddhistische Haus\\" in Berlin, Frohnau (German), Retrieved 29 January 2012 Under Dahlke's direction it became a center of Buddhism in Germany. After his death in 1928, the house was inherited by his relatives and Buddhists met in a house nearby. By 1941 Buddhist meetings and publications were prohibited by the Nazi government. After the war refugees lived in the quarters. The place deteriorated and was even considered for demolition, when Asoka Weeraratna from Sri Lanka became aware of its existence. In December 1957 he bought the building from Dahlke’s nephew on behalf of the German Dharmaduta Society (GDS). As a result, the 'Haus' became the first Buddhist mission on German soil not operated by German but Sri Lankan monks. It was renovated at that time as a Buddhist temple complex. Missionary Buddhist (Dharmaduta) monks, primarily from Sri Lanka, came to stay at the Haus that became the center for spreading the teachings of the Buddha in Western Europe. The temple is open to the public and was visited by about 5,000 people in 2006. The temple complex Entering the Elephant Door the visitor faces 73 steps up to reach the main building.

This bombing was the first major attack on a military base in Northern Ireland since the end of the IRA's ceasefire eight months earlier.  Background  The Provisional IRA ended its 1994 ceasefire on 9 February 1996, when a massive truck bomb went off in the London Docklands area, resulting in two deaths and causing huge damage, especially around the South Quay railway station.

John Bruton, then Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, called the bombing a \\"cynical betrayal of the peace process\\" by the IRA, while PUP leader David Ervine appealed to loyalists not to seek retaliation for the bombing. John Major, the British prime minister, made clear that \\"the IRA would not bomb its way into the Stormont talks\\". The attack was seen as a confirmation that the IRA had given up any hope of achieving a political breakthrough until the next British general elections in 1997.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. They are generally depicted as legions of uniformed soldiers, nearly all of them masked to appear anonymous, and widely diversified according to specialties and functions. \\"Viper\\" is the code-name given to a large majority of the Cobra Troopers. With the exception of the Viper infantry trooper, the code name \\"Viper\\" is usually preceded by their area of expertise. History The Cobra Soldiers were introduced in 1982, with the code name \\"The Enemy\\". These are the basic infantry soldiers equipped with conventional military gear (as opposed to the more hi-tech accouterments of the later Vipers). They were prominently featured on both the cartoon and comic series, and depicted as unintelligent and slightly cowardly. Introduced in 1986 as a replacement for the Cobra Soldiers, the Cobra Viper infantry soldiers complement the Cobra Soldiers in both the cartoon and comic series. The concept, originally introduced in 1985 with the introduction of \\"Tele-Vipers\\" (communication experts), quickly evolved into a catch-all suffix for all future Cobra troops (such as Air-Viper, Ice-Vipers, Desert-Vipers, Techno- Vipers, etc.). Hasbro has often alternated between establishing the Vipers as the entry-level position into Cobra's legion, or for them to be the elite of Cobra's ground troops, as far as them being equal to or above the regular soldier troops. Cobra infantry troopers are issued a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher, with advanced night vision, telescopic sight, and range finder. Multi-layered body armor and composite helmets with built-in communications gear are standard issue. Vipers are superbly trained, formidably equipped, and highly motivated. Vipers can opt for additional training that enables them to transfer to specialized units, focusing on specific military specialties. These units are considered elite and are constantly examined for effectiveness. Some are renamed and reorganized, absorbed into other units, or sometimes completely phased out. Some units customize their chain of command, allowing for unique Viper designations with distinct leaders. Other Cobra troopers Later, Cobra troopers consisted of communications troops, computer specialists, security, and soldiers. Some of the more prominent include: =Eels= The Cobra Eels are the underwater demolition specialists of the Cobra legions. They undergo a rigorous two-part training program, first in the shark and pirate infested waters of the Caribbean, and then in the frigid depths of the North Atlantic. Their training regimen includes marine engineering, explosive ordnance, underwater fighting techniques, and marine geology. Eels are responsible for manning and operating Cobra marine outposts disguised as off-shore drilling rigs, and for augmenting the crews of large Cobra naval vessels. =Lampreys= The Cobra Lampreys are Cobra's amphibious assault troopers, responsible for operation of Cobra naval vehicles, patrol around naval bases and attack. They are culled from the Eel units, and are considered elite among Cobra naval troopers, with only the Cobra Morays considered higher. To qualify for Lamprey training, candidates must be a Cobra Trooper in top physical condition, have completed his Eel training, and have been operational as an Eel for more than a year. The training is highly selective, and more than 50% of the applicants quit before completing the course. =Morays= The Morays are the next step in marine warfare, evolving from the most elite of the Eel division. They must undergo the same rigorous training program, which involves underwater fighting techniques, the study of marine geology, and the use of explosive ordnance. However, the Morays also utilize the same bio-tech engineering that is used by the Neo-Vipers, which gives them increased strength, underwater vision, and bodies that can better withstand the pressures of deep sea diving. =Snow Serpents= Snow Serpents are the Arctic Specialist branch of Cobra. They must undergo the same rigorous training program as the Eels, with the addition of a six-month cold weather course, somewhere above the Arctic Circle. Other aspects of their training include airborne operations under arctic conditions, anti-tank procedures, and the use of snow-shoes, skis and kayaks. =Crimson Guard= The Crimson Guard are the most elite soldiers of Cobra's Viper legions, under the direct command of Tomax and Xamot, but completely loyal to Cobra Commander, serving as his personal guard. =Python Patrol= Python Patrol is a codename given to a subgroup of Vipers and other Cobra troops whose uniforms have undergone the \\"pythonization\\" process. This renders their uniforms immune to radar and other forms of electronic detection. The unit has been led by both Copperhead and Major Bludd. In one instance, Zarana leads a unit on an attack on G.I. Joe's headquarters, the Pit.

How it is that these troops are \\"Vipers\\" and yet part of a non-Viper unit has never been explained by Hasbro.  Toys  The first figure to receive the designation \\"Viper\\" was the Viper Pilot (included with the Cobra Viper Attack Glider) in 1983. In 1985, Hasbro released the Tele-Viper (Cobra Communications) alongside other Cobra troops without the Viper designation, such as the Snow Serpent (Cobra Polar Assault) and the Eel (Cobra Frogman). For the most part since then, Cobra troops, including drivers and pilots, have had the Viper code name attached to their area of expertise. The Cobra Soldier figure was the standard infantry trooper for Cobra, until 1986 when Hasbro released the Cobra Viper figure. The Viper's uniform featured a black flak jacket and a mirrored mask that resembled the battle mask worn by Cobra Commander. This figure was later released both as part of the Python Patrol and Sonic Fighters sub-lines of G.I. Joe in alternate colors, in 1989 and 1990 respectively. In 1994 a new standard infantry Viper figure was released with a new look (purple armor with gas mask). In the G.I. Joe comic book series published by Marvel Comics, this version of the Viper was portrayed in a yellow-gold color. This new uniform did not last long and the more familiar Viper look later returned.

They were voiced by several voice actors including: Michael Bell, Arthur Burghardt, Peter Cullen, Pat Fraley, Buster Jones, Chris Latta, Bill Ratner, and Frank Welker. The Cobra Vipers made their first animated appearance in Arise Serpentor Arise!, which began the second season of the Sunbow produced series. They were used as common infantry for the remainder of the season, primarily replacing the blue and black masked Cobra soldiers of the first season (although those soldiers would still appear from time to time). The Strato-Vipers that spoke were voiced by Jack Angel and Bill Ratner. The Tele-Vipers that spoke were voiced by Michael Bell, Chris Latta, and Frank Welker. = DiC = G.I. Joe cartoon. The Cobra Troopers were also the foot soldiers in the DiC G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero cartoon. Some of the Cobra Troopers loyal to Cobra Commander became soldiers in Cobra Commander's Python Patrol. Following G.I. Joe: The Movie, in the DiC run of cartoons, the main silver face-plated Cobra Vipers were replaced by various branches of Vipers (such as Range-Vipers and Laser-Vipers). The Alley Vipers played heavy into the plot of the first mini series from the DiC produced G.I. Joe cartoon. G.I. Joe member Scoop is in training as a Crimson Guardsman, and his closest friend in Cobra is an Alley Viper. Scoop helps Cobra Commander take control back from Serpentor. The Range-Vipers appeared in many episodes of the cartoon. Two Range-Vipers appeared to have a vendetta against two G.I. Joe members: Captain Grid-Iron and Ambush. * The First Range-Viper appeared in Pigskin Commandos, he played quarterback for the pro football team, but hated Grid-Iron who was the quarterback of the other team. * The Second Ranger-Viper was a female named Ivy, who used to be the friend of Ambush. She was able to find all his hiding places, until Ambush disappeared to join G.I. Joe, and she vowed to kill him because he left without saying goodbye. Techno-Vipers and Hydro- Vipers were only featured (cartoon-wise) in the commercials, since the 80s Sunbow cartoon had finished its production by the time their figures were released. =G.I.

Alley Vipers were updated for the Resolute cartoon, and were in an all blue uniform. = G.I. Joe: Renegades = The Cobra Troopers in G.I. Joe: Renegades were depicted as the security guards for the facilities of Cobra Industries, such as Cobra Pharmaceuticals. They were voiced by were voiced by Charlie Adler, Carlos Alazraqui, Michael Bell, Matthew Yang King, Andrew Kishino, Jason Marsden, Khary Payton, and Kevin Michael Richardson. In G.I. Joe: Renegades, there are also different Vipers who are not human: * The Bio Vipers are artificial creatures created by Doctor Mindbender from a blue liquid developed from experimentally altered plants. Originally, the Bio-Vipers lacked a nervous system and showed weaknesses to explosions and weed killer. However, Mindbender upgrades his creations with bio-dampening chips, which makes them smarter, but leaves them vulnerable to head shots. These creatures share many traits and attributes with the \\"synthoids\\" of the original cartoon, and seem to be an homage to them. ** A freak accident caused by Ripcord absorbing Bio-Viper matter into his body, created the potential to produce a human-Bio-Viper hybrid, with Cobra Commander seeing the potential of achieving immortality through it, upon being experimented on by Doctor Mindbender. To ensure control, Doctor Mindbender places a control chip on Ripcord, in order to turn him into a Bio-Viper on command. After the events of \\"Prodigal\\", Doctor Mindbender attempts to duplicate the DNA combination in \\"The Anomaly\\". * During the events of \\"The Enemy of My Enemy\\", Doctor Mindbender is forced to work alongside Destro to combine their research to produce a combination of the Bio-Viper and M.A.R.S exo suits. Though earlier attempts failed, Doctor Mindbender devised a perfect fusion in the creation of the Mecha-Vipers. * In \\"White Out,\\" Shadow Vipers are black-colored versions of Bio Vipers, which were created to respond to Storm Shadow's mental commands, after Tomax and Xamot are used to establish a psychic link. The Shadow Vipers can materialize any part of them into ninja weapons, from katana-bladed arms to shurikens. * A Techno-Viper is a specially created prototype Bio-Viper that was synthesized with nanotechnology, enabling it to absorb energy and manipulate any machine that it comes in contact with. But as the prototype Techno-Viper was uncontrollable, Cobra Industries had to put it into a container and keep it in cold temperatures. ** During the events of \\"Shipwrecked\\", G.I. Joe found a container holding a prototype Techno-Viper in Canada, and later disposed of it. During the fight, Scarlett managed to set the Techno-Viper's destination to be Castle McCullen in Scotland. When learning of this, as he and Baroness interrogated the Joes, Destro suspects that Doctor Mindbender probably programmed the Techno-Viper to dispose of him. * Though Mindbender's first attempt was seemingly a failure, the artificial human/Bio-Viper hybrid code named 14-C, managed to reform itself in the sewers in New York City. Its lurking in the sewers caused it to be referred to as a Sewer Viper. However, lacking the ability to assume human form, the Sewer Viper spirited a kid named Reggie into the sewers, while hurting a teenager named Ray for bullying him. News of this attracted Cobra Commander's attention, as he orders Doctor Mindbender to reclaim the Sewer Viper before it is caught by the authorities. At the same time, Duke, Roadblock, Tunnel Rat and Ripcord descend into the sewers to find Reggie and the Sewer Viper, revealed to be a good guy. Coming to the Joes' aid when captured by Mindbender, the Sewer Viper is revealed to lack a control chip while managing to remove the control chip from Ripcord. The Sewer Viper sacrifices itself, absorbing the explosion from the fail-safe that Mindbender installed, should his mental link with the Bio-Vipers' control chips be broken.  Film  = G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra = Neo-Vipers were Cobra troopers who were enhanced with nanomites by The Doctor. These enhancements removed their self-preservation instincts and their sense of pain, and made them completely obedient to Cobra. Cobra Vipers originally consisted mostly of mercenaries and criminals, however after the completion of all of Cobra's nano experimentation Neo-Vipers may have mostly consisted of kidnapped soldiers from around the world. Twenty mercenaries were selected for the painful series of injections, and the ones who did not die became super soldiers. Each subject was injected with 1,000 CCs of nanomite solution, which left a small scar in the shape of a small cobra's head (all nano injected members of Cobra bear this mark, including Baroness, Zartan and much later Destro). After injection, specially designed nanomites both attack and rewire the subject's central nervous system, making the subject completely under the absolute control of their controller (the only exception to this was Zartan, who destroyed the neural controlling nanomites before he was injected).  Video games  Some Vipers (such as Hydro-Vipers and Toxo-Vipers) appeared as regular enemies in the 1991 G.I. Joe video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unusually for a non-individual, a Range-Viper appeared as a boss in the game. Vipers also appeared in the game G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor. Konami released an arcade-only G.I.Joe video game in 1992. Vipers were prominent enemies.  Other works  * Cobra Vipers are an important plot element in the G.I. Joe novel Divide and Conquer. * A Viper figure is briefly featured in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures to set up a battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. As he imagined the characters in his head, he observed the \\"core of Cobra Command\\" atop an oak toy chest, high above the thick shag carpet, while a nearby Viper, \\"one of many similarly dressed infantrymen, stood at the ready alongside a ragged copy of The Haunted Spy\\". * Range-Viper is mentioned as one of many Cobra toys in a New Yorker article, page 142, printed on December 10, 1993.

Smirnov's principal works in mathematical statistics and probability theory were devoted to the investigation of limit distributions by means of the asymptomatic behaviour of multiple integrals as the multiplicity is increased with limit. He was one of the creators of the nonparametric methods in mathematical statistics and of the theory of limit distributions of order statistics.  Biography  Nikolai Vasilyevich Smirnov was born October 17, 1900 in Moscow into the family of a church clerk who was also employed as a clerk in the office of the Bolshoi Theater. He completed his gymnasium education during the First World War, during which he served in various medical units of the military. After the October Revolution Smirnov joined the ranks of the Red Army. During this time he took an interest in philosophy and philology, which shaped his later interests in mathematics. It is suggested that Smirnov was influenced by the works of Velimir Khlebnikov, who had emphasized that the most fruitful results in arts and humanities could be achieved only after thoroughly understanding the natural sciences. According to the testimony of a friend, the artist S. P. Isakov, Smirnov, following this advice, entered Moscow State University after his discharge from the army in 1921 and focused his attention to the study of mathematics. Smirnov graduated from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow State University, and, beginning in 1926, taught mathematics for many years at Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, Moscow City Pedagogical Institute, and Moscow State University. During this time, Smirnov narrowed his research foci to the fields of probability theory and mathematical statistics. Smirnov's initial period of research ended in 1938 with the defense of his doctoral dissertation \\"On approximation of the distribution laws of random variables\\" (Russian: Об аппроксимации законов распределения случайных величин), which served as the foundation for his work on nonparametric tests for which he was later renowned. After his dissertation, Smirnov took up research with the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in 1938, where he worked for the remainder of his life. While at the institute he obtained new fundamental results in nonparametric statistics, and also studied the limit distributions of nonparametric criteria, the theory of large deviations, and the limit distributions for terms of variational series. For these series of works Smirnov was awarded the State Prize in 1951. In 1957 he was made the Head of Mathematical Statistics at the Steklov Institute. In 1960 Smirnov was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR as a corresponding member, in recognition for his contributions to the advancement of mathematical statistics. Smirnov died on June 2, 1966. His sudden, unexpected death left him unable to complete his research in mathematical genetics, to which he had returned in the final years of his life with the intention to publish several works.  Contributions to Statistics  Together with Andrey Kolmogorov, Smirnov developed the Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion, sometimes called the Kolmogorov consent criterion, and participated in the creation of the Cramér–von Mises–Smirnov criterion. Smirnov made great efforts to popularize and widely disseminate methods of mathematical statistics in the natural sciences and engineering. In the 1950s, he was one of the first Soviet mathematicians to compile modern manuals on the use of statistics in engineering. His textbooks and manuals on the practical application of probabilistic and statistical methods were used in the USSR and abroad. Together with L. N. Bolshev, Smirnov published a series of tables of various special functions most frequently used in probability theory and mathematical statistics, continuing the work started in the USSR by his colleague Eugen Slutsky, making important contributions to modern computational mathematics. In 1970, under the editorship of L. N. Bolshev, selected works of Smirnov were published.  Honours  Smirnov received the State Prize of the USSR in 1951. In 1953 he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.  Notable Works  * N. V. Smirnov and I. V.

It is co-written by Tucaković and Saša Radojević with input from Dimitrije Vojnov. Loosely based on actual events, the plot centers around famous American director Nicholas Ray's 1960s stay in SFR Yugoslavia on invitation by Ratko Dražević, the head of Avala Film studio and former Yugoslav state security operative. Since, according to Tucaković, the story of Ray's Belgrade stay is \\"quite foggy\\", the film's characters were treated \\"more as a myth than as a document\\". Additionally, since Dražević's specific biographical info is entirely sketchy and mostly based on anecdotes, the actor who plays him in the movie, Dragan Bjelogrlić, said that his portrayal is \\"based on legend rather than biography\\".“'Doktor Rej i đavoli' je legenda“;B92, 3 March 2012 Additional actual figures that appear as characters in the film are film director D.

Problems with drugs and alcohol have made him fall on hard times, but his name in the world of cinema still holds enough cache to get him a lucrative offer of shooting a movie with Yugoslav state funds — a spectacular costumed horror-drama based on Dylan Thomas's 1953 screenplay The Doctor and the Devils.Pogledajte trejler za film \\"Doktor Rej i đavoli\\";Blic, 14 October 2011 On the other hand, Ray's powerful host, the director of state-owned production company Avala Film and former UDBA (Yugoslav state security) operative Ratko Dražević, is dreaming big dreams — he is trying to establish a 'Hollywood behind the Iron Curtain' of sorts and feels that Nicholas Ray is a good fit in this regard.MONDO na snimanju filma \\"Dr Rej i đavoli\\";mondo.rs, 16 August 2011 Cast *Paul Leonard Murray ...

Samuel Bronston Production =Background= Dinko Tucaković had been intrigued by the circumstances of Nicholas Ray's 1960s three-year stay in Yugoslavia ever since he became aware of it in 1979 as a student at the University of Arts' Faculty of Dramatic Arts (FDU). He was told about it by his FDU professor Vladimir Slijepčević who had personally hung out with Ray in Belgrade.Polimac vs. Ray;Jutarnji list, September 2011 Over the coming years, Tucaković became a known film director in Yugoslavia as well as a film historian and curator running the Yugoslav Film Archive (Jugoslovenska kinoteka). Since two of the most eminent sources on Ray — Bernard Eisenschitz's Nicholas Ray: An American Life and Jonathan Rosenbaum's articles — barely mention the famed director's Yugoslav days, Tucaković dug for information through private channels thus unearthing many details about Ray's life in the communist country. Contracted by the state-owned studio Avala Film, headed at the time by the powerful and controversial former UDBA operative Ratko Dražević, Ray was approved a US$1.7 million budget to come up with the adapted screenplay from Dylan Thomas's novel The Doctor and the Devils and use it to direct a movie for which Maximilian Schell, Susannah York, and Geraldine Chaplin had been cast. A notorious alcoholic, compulsive gambler, and heavy drug user, Ray spent his time in Belgrade living in Hotel Moskva and getting acquainted with the city's cultural elite. He also hung out with Polish director Andrzej Wajda who was in town shooting Gates to Paradise, also for Avala Film. Known to be bisexual, Ray, who was married at the time, was said to have had both a mistress and a male lover in Belgrade. He furthermore had plans of getting a permanent residence in Belgrade after identifying a business opportunity for vehicle import into Yugoslavia as a Volkswagen representative and feeling that it could potentially be more lucrative for him than movies. He additionally spent some time in Zagreb as well as on the island of Hvar where he sequestered himself to do work on the screenplay. In the end, Ray never made The Doctor and the Devils due to variety of reasons mostly having to do with Avala Film's financial problems caused by one of its co-productions — French-Italian historical adventure spectacular La Fabuleuse aventure de Marco Polo by Noël Howard and Raoul Lévy that ran severely over budget. Problems with Marco Polo forced Avala into looking for a foreign production partner for The Doctor and the Devils; when it couldn't get one on board, it scrapped the project and Ray left the country. Some twenty years later, English cinematographer and director Freddie Francis shot The Doctor and the Devils. By the time the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia disintegrated in the early 1990s, Tucaković was sure he wanted to make a movie about Ray's stay in the country. In Venice, at the film festival, he met with Wim Wenders, Ray's admirer and good friend who had given Ray a part in the 1977 film The American Friend before chronicling his death in the 1980 documentary Lightning Over Water. Wenders expressed interest in contributing to Tucaković's project, but nothing ever came of it due to the inability of Bandur Film, the production company behind the planned project, to access EU co-production funds. The idea went dormant again, but what gave Tucaković hope was that whenever he mentioned the idea to film industry people at symposiums or film festivals it would always find a very receptive audience. =Project= Finally, by 2008 Tucaković had the script ready. He had also collected such an abundance of material that in addition to the feature film, he decided to also write a book and make a documentary. He decided to make the feature as a mixture of fact and fiction similar to Oliver Parker's Fade to Black about Orson Welles' entanglement with the CIA in Rome in 1948. The preparation and pre-production for the feature film took place throughout 2009. Originally cast to play Nicholas Ray was Willem Dafoe, however, problems with the film's financing forced Tucaković into pushing the production start date back on several occasions. As a result, Dafoe dropped out of the project as he had other movies lined up. Similarly, the role of Ray's wife Betty Utey changed several protagonists due to this scheduling uncertainty. Originally cast was Anica Dobra who had in the meantime, while waiting for Doktor Rej i đavoli to start shooting, gotten other roles and eventually dropped out of the project. Her replacement was Nataša Janjić, but her theater commitments forced another change of plans so the role finally went to Ana Sofrenović. Another original idea that had to be scrapped was casting Rade Šerbedžija to play the character of famous Croatian writer Miroslav Krleža (Šerbedžija incidentally knew Krleža very well). The shooting finally started in late 2010 and went on-and-off until fall 2011 on locations in Belgrade and Luštica, Montenegro. In addition to the acted scenes, the film features plenty of documentary stock footage of Paris and Belgrade. The 'movie within a movie' footage of the film Ray is working on is actually taken from Tucaković's 1990 horror short film Bernisa, jača od smrti. Critical reception The early reviews following the film's premiere at FEST have been negative. Blic's Milan Vlajčić observes that \\"the movie portrays two lumens of Serbian culture, Mihiz and Saša Petrović, as Dražević's suck-ups and hangers- on\\". He further points out that those familiar with the era will understand the movie's subtext, but expresses doubts whether even they will find it entertaining and worthwhile\\".Holivud u Beogradu - „Doktor Rej i đavoli“ (D. Tucaković) ;Blic, 5 March 2012 Politika's Dubravka Lakić disliked the movie, calling it \\"self-indulgent film prose that arbitrarily mixes fiction with fact\\" and referring to it as \\"Tucaković's 30-year-long obsession that's now out of his system, hopefully for good\\". She further states that \\"at times the movie almost turns into a chamber play with the plot entirely taking place inside a few interiors, all of which places extra pressure on the screenplay as well as the performances that fall short of what's required to elevate the story - Paul Leonard Murray as Nicholas Ray is amateurish (as is Gordon Murray playing Orson Welles) while Bjelogrlić essentially plays himself from the producer phase of his cinematic career\\".Đavolska proizvoljna posla;Politika, 6 March 2012 References External links * Category:2012 films Category:Serbian-language films Category:Serbian films Category:Films set in Serbia Category:Films set in Yugoslavia Category:Films shot in Serbia ","title":"Doktor Rej i đavoli"},{"id":"34539273","text":"Maria Amapola Cabase, better known by her stage name Amapola, is a Filipino singer, actress, musician, television and radio host.

Physical description The male is blue with a bar across the eye. 9 to 12 bars go down vertically. The fins are blue with slightly dark margins. The female looks different from the male and is brown with bars that can barely be seen. Life span 44 specimens hatched at 22 degrees Celsius had a mean life span of 11 to 11 1/2 months. Out of the 44 specimens, the maximal life span was less than 14 months. The February 1965 study concluded that annual fish live short lives and that if Cynolebias species are at 16 degrees Celsius, the fish have decreased aging. Another experiment showed that Cynolebias elongatus, Cynolebias wolterstoffi, and this species can have a longer life span if their body temperature is lowered 3 to 5 degrees. The scientists came to this result by putting different specimens in different temperatures to show a survival rate. Naming Austrolebua adloffi was described as Cynolebias adloffi in 1922 by Ernst Ahl. The specific name honours the German-born Brazilian artist Alfred Adloff, who discovered it. It is the type species of the genus Austrolebias.

Purpose Land bonds are normally issued under the provisions of land bonds act of a state government or the central government. The bonds define the terms and conditions for the issuance of the bonds, negotiability of such bonds, principal amount per bond, payment of interest, ability to trade the bonds in open market, tax exemptions granted if any, and redemption of such bonds. Land bonds in Guyana Guyana passed a Land Bonds Act in 1959. The act allows the Government of Guyana to acquire land from any person or entity who owns the land or to whom compensation is payable in respect to the purchase or acquisition of the land. The payment for the land may be made in land bonds with the consent of the person or entity, and at the discretion of the government. The land bonds have the following features: *They are issued by the state authority responsible for finance. *The denomination of the land bonds are uniform. *The bonds are one of three types - fixed date bonds, drawing bonds, annuity bonds. **The fixed date bonds are redeemable at par on a fixed date, as declared at the issue of the bonds. **The drawing bonds are redeemable by annual drawings, and similar to a callable bond. The government may call part or whole of certain bonds every year. The redeemable price is at least equal to the par value of the bond. **The annuity bonds are payable by semi-annual payments that pay part of the principal and accrued interest, over a period of time. *The land bonds are usually of a maturity between 5 and 10 years. *The interest payable on the bond is described by the bond. The interest may be fixed at the time of issuance, or it may be a floating rate that changes with prevailing interest rates or inflation rates. *The interest is payable every quarter or semi- annually. Land bonds in Ireland Ireland has several statutes relating to land bonds. Ireland's Land Commission may, under its Land Acts, acquire land and pay vendors (landowners) for the acquired land with new land bonds equal in nominal amount to the purchase money and carrying interest as from the date on which the land purchased. The law mandates that new land bonds issued to a vendor for the acquired land, be accepted by such vendor as the equivalent of the corresponding amount of purchase money, and any person having power to sell, may enter into a subsequent purchase agreement notwithstanding that the purchase money under the laws of Ireland is paid in new land bonds instead of cash. Land bonds in Jamaica Jamaica passed its Land Bonds Act in 1955. The act allows the Government of Jamaica to pay with bonds any land acquired from any person or entity who owns the land or to whom compensation is payable. The land bonds have the following features: *They are issued by the state authority responsible for finance. *The bonds are one of two types - Series A or Series B. *The land bonds may be used, to pay in whole or in part, solely at the discretion of the government. *The terms of the bond are described by the bond. It includes principal, interest and maturity. Land bonds in Brazil The constitution of Brazil has several articles covering the use of bonds to compensate for land acquisition. Some of these articles are: *Article 182, which states that a municipal government may, for an area included in its master plan, according to Brazil's federal law, expropriate land. The municipal government may pay for the land in public debt bonds, redeemable within up to ten years, in equal and successive annual installments, ensuring the real value of the compensation and the legal interest. *Article 184, which states that it is within the power of the state to acquire, on account of social interest, a rural property against prior and fair compensation in agrarian bonds with a clause providing for maintenance of the real value, redeemable within a period of up to twenty years computed as from the second year of issue, and the use of which shall be defined in the law. Land bonds in South Korea South Korea enacted its Land Reform Act in 1949. Under this Act, the government acquired land from landlords, and compensated them in government bonds worth 1.5 times the annual output on the land. Land bonds in Taiwan In Taiwan, the Equalization of Land Rights Act explains the use of bonds for land acquisition. The Taiwan law provides the following: *Article 5 of the Act provides that the central government and the competent municipal authorities may issue land bonds to pay for the purchase of private lands at their declared values. *Article 6 states that the prices of the lands acquired for public purposes, according to their declared values, shall be paid all in cash if below a certain minimum value, after the deduction of any taxes due. However, if the amount to be paid to a landowner is above this minimum value, the portion in excess of that government set minimum value, shall be paid with land bonds for a minimum of 50 percent or in a percentage amount specified by the government.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the nonpartisan Environmental Quality Council of the Montana Legislature and the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. In 2010, she was elected to the Montana House of Representatives and served three two-year terms before retiring. On June 5, 2018, Williams won the Democratic primary election for the 2018 election for Montana's at-large seat in the United States House of Representatives, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Republican Greg Gianforte in the general election. Early life and education Williams was born February 16, 1961, in a United States Army hospital in California. Her father was a U.S. Army soldier who served in World War II; much of her childhood was spent as a \\"military brat\\". When Williams was 11 years old, her 49-year-old mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Williams assisted her father in caring for her mother, who died when Williams was in her teens. Williams enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. Taking her father's advice, she intended to earn a degree in business administration. After taking a class in forestry, she realized she was far more interested in natural resource policy. She switched majors, and graduated in 1983 with a bachelor of science in natural resource economics. After holding a series of jobs, Williams enrolled at Colorado State University where she received a master's degree in recreation resources. Her graduate thesis analyzed how much water was needed to support recreation on a wild and scenic river. Early career Williams worked for a time for the United States Forest Service as well as several private conservation and recreation organizations in the west. She moved to Montana in 1995 to take a position as nonpartisan lead staffer at the Environmental Quality Council (EQC), a bipartisan committee of the Montana Legislature. She focused on mining policy, recreation policy, and water quality issues for the committee. As an EQC staffer, she also served as a member of the staff of the Montana House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, where she took the lead on water policy issues. Williams left the Environmental Quality Council after four years and took a job in 1999 as a Water Program Manager with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Her work focused on improving water flows and water quality in streams with low water flows. Williams served as the department's representative on the Governor's Drought Advisory Committee in 2003. She left the department in 2004 to become executive director of the Instream Flow Council, a nonprofit association of provincial, state, and territorial fish and wildlife agencies in the United States and Canada. Williams also founded and managed Jetway Geographer, which published natural history guides and distributed them on airplanes. Montana state legislature In 2007, the Montana state legislature adjourned without passing a state budget, deadlocked over how to spend a $1.4 billion surplus. A budget was passed only after a three-day special session.; Angered by the legislature's inaction, Williams decided to run for office. =2010 election= Williams was first elected to the Montana Legislature in 2010. She ran in House district 65, a heavily Democratic district which covered the southeast part of the city of Bozeman, Montana and which included Montana State University (MSU). Williams considered running for office as an independent, but chose to run as a Democrat. Three-term incumbent Brady Wiseman (D) was retiring from office, and Williams faced Bethan Letiecq in the Democratic primary election. Letiecq emphasized her experience lobbying the state legislature on grandparental rights and immigration, as well as her work for the General Accountability Office, a federal agency. She proposed a windfall profits tax on oil companies to fund improvements in education. Williams emphasized her work for the state legislature and state agencies, arguing she was better qualified to achieve compromise when contentious issues arose. She said she was not a single-issue candidate, pointing to her work with the Montana League of Women Voters on education and healthcare. She said her work in the legislature would focus on improving Montana's economy by promoting sustainable industries and on developing a state energy policy. Williams won the primary election by a vote of 255 to 164 (60.8 to 39.2 percent). Williams faced Republican Nick Mahan in the general election. Mahan, who worked servicing magnetic resonance imaging equipment, proposed a 3-to-5 percent across-the-board cut to the state budget, elimination of the business equipment tax, and a limit on the number bills that could be introduced in each 90-day legislative session. He portrayed Williams as in favor of more bureaucracy and higher taxes. Williams was endorsed by Wiseman, and focused her campaign on the economy, education, and the environment. She continued to emphasize her experience working for the state legislature and state agencies. Williams won the general election by a vote of 1,288 to 665 (65.9 to 33.1 percent). =2011 session of the Montana House of Representatives= Williams was assigned to the House agriculture, natural resources, and taxation committees. She sponsored a successful bill (H.B. 615) which required health insurance companies to provide routine cancer treatment to patients in clinical trials. Williams's first term in office occurred in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008–2010. She says she gained a much deeper appreciation for the importance of a diversified economy and workforce development during this period. Beginning with her first term and service on the House Committee on Natural Resources, Williams sought to protect the water rights of irrigators and the right of sport fishermen to healthy fisheries protected by adequate water flows. =2012 election= Williams was re-elected to the Montana Legislature in 2012. She was unopposed in the 2012 Democratic primary. Williams faced Nick Mahan again in the general election. Mahan focused his campaign on improving the economy, opposing expansion in the size of government, lowering taxes, and \\"keeping MSU thriving\\". He proposed keeping some of the state's $460 million ($ in dollars) budget surplus in reserve and returning the rest to taxpayers, expansion of energy exploration and production, and using a portion of the state natural resource tax to fund education. Mahan said he favored a tuition freeze at MSU so long as it did not impair the university. Williams once more focused on the economy, education and the environment. Her highest priorities in the legislature would also include healthcare accessibility and affordability; protecting stream access for sportsmen and recreational users; and more equitable funding for the state's school system. Williams said she was open to a tuition freeze at MSU, but also wanted to improve pay for faculty and staff at the school. Williams won the general election by a vote of 2,298 to 989 (69.9 to 30.1 percent). In November 2012, Williams was appointed to the Montana Reserved Water Rights Commission. =2013 session of the Montana House of Representatives= Williams was assigned to the House agriculture, natural resources, rules, and taxation committees. She served as the Minority Vice Chair of the Agriculture Committee. Williams helped write a bill which ordered a study of whether water wells and septic systems should be exempt from environmental regulation. The legislature approved the study rather than adopt legislation that would have legalized this exemption. During the 2013 legislative session, Williams took the lead in helping to win legislative approval for the Compact and Ordinance for the Flathead Reservation Water Rights Settlement, an agreement between the U.S. federal government, the state of Montana, and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes that defines water rights for the tribes as well as affects water use across western Montana. The tribes had threatened to sue to enforce their rights in the Montana Water Court, litigation that might have taken years to resolve and cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Negotiations on the compact had taken more than a decade, and legislative approval proved highly contentious.; Williams was appointed to and served as Minority Vice Chair of the Montana Legislature's Water Policy Committee, which met during the interim between the 2013 and 2015 legislative sessions to collect information, analyze, and report to the legislature concerning water policy issues in the state. =2014 election= Williams was re-elected to the Montana Legislature in 2014. After the 2010 United States Census, Montana's state legislature underwent redistricting. House district 65 shifted to northeast Bozeman. House district 61 shifted to a large, less densely populated area north and east of the old House district 65. MSU was shifted into House district 63. The local newspaper described Williams' new district as leaning Democratic. Williams was unopposed in the 2014 Democratic primary. Williams faced Nick Mahan for a third time in the general election. Mahan campaigned on reducing the size of government and promoting the free market. He proposed using state energy production taxes to fund a statewide college tuition aid program and infrastructure improvements in eastern Montana, scaling back regulations on energy production, and transferring federally owned land to state control. Mahan opposed Medicaid expansion, disclaimed a belief in climate change, and called many people in eastern Montana and those who used Medicaid \\"welfare-dependent\\". Williams campaigned primarily on healthcare. She said her legislative focus would be on healthcare issues \\"that really need to be fixed\\", such as lowering prescription drug costs. Although she said she would consider Medicaid expansion, she advocated first having a \\"broad dialogue\\" on healthcare that would consider a wide range of solutions. Other issues she intended to work on included the deregulation of non- hazardous homemade foods, improving tax equity to reduce property tax burdens for people on fixed incomes, eliminating the tax holiday on new oil and natural gas wells and using the revenue for public schools, and improving the state's railroad plan to reduce emergency service response times. Williams won the general election by a vote of 2,975 to 2,187 (57.6 to 42.4 percent). =2015 session of the Montana House of Representatives= Williams was assigned to the House agriculture, natural resources, rules, and taxation committees. She served as the Minority Vice Chair of the Taxation Committee. Williams introduced and won passage of HB 478, a food safety law that expanded the kind of homemade foods allowed to be sold at home, farmers' markets, mobile venues (such as food trucks), online, or at other public or private venues.; Williams also introduced and won passage of HB 258, the Montana Benefit Corporation Act. The legislation authorized the establishment of for- profit public benefit corporations in the state.; Williams again agreed to shepherd the Compact and Ordinance for the Flathead Reservation Water Rights Settlement during the 2015 legislative session. She succeeded in winning the legislature's approval of the bill. She opposed two major tax cut bills supported by the Republican majority, arguing that piecemeal tax reform avoided the issue of overhauling the entire tax code and did not achieve property tax fairness for those on fixed incomes. Western Landowners Alliance After serving three terms in the Montana House of Representatives, Williams declined to seek re-election in 2016. She later said she decided not to seek a fourth term in the Montana House of Representatives in order to run for federal office. In 2014, Williams took a position as an associate director for water policy issues at the Western Landowners Alliance, a nonprofit group of private landowners that formed in 2011 to serve as a clearinghouse on science and strategies to create economically viable, sustainable ranches and other working lands while also protecting watersheds and wildlife. U.S. House of Representatives =2018= June 2018 Democratic primary On October 24, 2017, Williams announced she would enter the Democratic Party primary to represent Montana's at-large district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Most political observers considered her candidacy a \\"long shot\\". Williams entered an already-crowded field of challengers that included John Heenan, an attorney from Billings (the state's largest city); Grant Kier, director of a Missoula-based nonprofit conservation organization; Lynda Moss, a former state legislator; and Tom Woods, also a former state legislator. She also entered the election relatively late, months after the first two candidates declared. Williams also trailed in fundraising: at the end of 2017, Heenan and Kier both had raised more than $250,000 to Williams's $73,000. In announcing her candidacy, Williams said her top two issues were healthcare and tax reform. She believed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, promoted and signed into law by President Donald Trump, was fiscally irresponsible. She pledged that as a member of Congress, she would protect broad health insurance coverage for all Montanans and lower insurance and prescription drug costs; improve spending on education and workforce development; protect the right to form a union; end discrimination in all forms; protect public lands; restore civility and integrity to Congress; and reassert the congressional role in foreign affairs. She also advocated improving economic diversity in Montana to ensure economic growth, and protecting economic development programs aimed at rural areas (such as the Farm Bill, funding for rural healthcare, and the USDA Rural Development agency). A proponent of legal immigration, Williams said she supported ideas put forth by border-state legislators to use modern technology to strengthen the border with Mexico. She opposed tariffs because they hurt Montana's agricultural exporters. Williams began her campaign emphasizing her experience and success as a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature, her ability to appeal to both parties while serving as nonpartisan legislative staff, and her work for private farmers and ranchers in promoting conservation. Williams also laid claim to the legacy of Republican feminist and legendary Montana politician Jeannette Rankin, saying she hoped to be Rankin's \\"long overdue successor\\". Williams adopted a campaign strategy of visiting \\"all corners of the state\\". She traveled in her own Prius and pickup truck, towing a camper behind her. At one point, she drove more than crisscrossing the state in a single week. She emphasized her plan to allow people 55-to-64 years of age to buy into Medicare and her proposal to allow Medicare to bargain with pharmaceutical companies in order to reduce prescription drug prices. She also began emphasizing a return to civility in Congress. Lacking the funds to run television advertisements statewide, Williams's ad buys focused on geographic areas where she believed she could boost her vote totals (such as Missoula County). Ads on her healthcare ideas featured her work helping constituents and her own mother's battle with Alzheimer's disease, which political observers felt were highly effective. After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Williams came out with several gun control proposals. A gun owner, hunter, and sport shooter, Williams advocated for universal background checks and a ban on bump stocks. She also proposed banning the use of AR-15 style rifles outside of controlled environments like shooting ranges. She also proposed that Congress regulate military assault-style weapons the same way it regulates machine guns. Despite being outspent roughly two-to-one, Williams won the June 5 Democratic primary with 37,146 votes (33.5 percent of votes cast). John Heenan came in second with 35,154 votes (31.7 percent), and Grant Kier had 26,832 votes (24.2 percent). Williams won nearly half of the state's counties. Robert Saldin, a professor of political science at the University of Montana, observed that where Williams didn't win, she came in second. Moreover, although other candidates showed large vote totals only in pockets across the state, Williams ran strongly statewide. Voter turnout was particularly high in Gallatin County, where Williams resides. A record 12,707 primary votes were cast there. This helped to offset Heenan's vote totals in his home county of Yellowstone, Montana's most populous county. Williams' targeted advertising strategy also paid off in Missoula. Williams polled nearly as many votes as Kier in his home county of Missoula. She won four of the five surrounding counties as well. November 2018 general election Williams received endorsements from different Montana newspapers over Gianforte. Amongst them were the Billings Gazettehttps://billingsgazette.com/opinion/editorial/gazette-opinion-restore- civility-elect-williams-to-u-s- house/article_77dde0ca-6947-53f1-af1e-8275d33e6e20.html, the Bozeman Daily Chroniclehttps://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/opinions/editorials/williams- the-moderate-montana-needs/article_0faf3196-c27c-5602-86bc-d1ad5a5aa786.html, and the Missoulianhttps://missoulian.com/opinion/editorial/williams-is-by-far- the-better-candidate-for-us-house/article_65489984-5e18-54fe- aec3-1d4b89605cdd.html Williams lost the general election with 233,284 votes (46.2%) against incumbent Greg Gianforte, who received 256,611 votes (50.9%), and Libertarian Party Candidate Elinor Swanson (2.9%)https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/montana-house-district-at- large. =2020=  Political positions  = Health care = Williams has said her number one priority is health care policy because she believes health care in Montana is too expensive. She supports preserving affordable insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and would allow people aged 55 to 64 to buy in to Medicare if they prefer it over their other insurance options. She seeks to lower the cost of prescription drugs. She would fight the Trump administration's decision to allow businesses to pursue new uses for asbestos. = Local issues = Williams believes the Montana government has ignored regional concerns of residents, especially in rural areas. She traveled over 42,000 miles in her hybrid car to talk to locals, and keeps a running list of local concerns from every stop along with the name and contact numbers of the people who raised the concerns. For example, she would pursue an irrigation project for sugar beet farmers in Sidney, build a levee to protect Miles City from flooding, and address the 20-year asbestos health crisis in Libby. Personal life Williams is an avid fisher, hiker, hunter, and skier. She is a gun owner and has participated in shooting sports. Williams is a member of and has worked extensively with the League of Women Voters, and is the former vice chair of the Greater Gallatin Watershed Council (a water conservation and water quality group in Gallatin County). Williams married Tom Pick, an agricultural development contractor during the Iraq War, in the rotunda of the Montana State Capitol building in 2001. She became stepmother to his two adult sons, Calen and Sander. Pick died in January 2016 at the age of 67.

Early life John Williams was born in the small town of Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada on 7 March 1940. Williams belonged to the Native American tribe Wabenaki, and was a direct ancestor of the great Wabenaki war chief Madockaweando. Both of John's parents spoke French and were part of the Wabenaki tribe. Dr. John Williams has always been an avid mixed martial artist (MMA) fighter, and started fighting at the juvenile age of 7. Williams picked up fast on mixed martial arts (MMA), and by age 16 he had already received training in Olympic-style weightlifting, Kodokan Judo, and Tani-Ha Jiu-Jitsu. By the time John reached the age of 23, he had started giving demonstrations that authenticated pure forms of strength and ability. Some of the tasks he performed included, bending spikes, tearing phonebooks and license plates in half, and holding two jeeps from going in the opposite directions. Martial Arts/MMA Career Williams became so influential through the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA), that he eventually opened up a Jiu-Jitsu practice in the United States in 1963. Although having his own practice which kept him busy in the sport, Williams went on to teach a variety of seminars all over the world. Williams brought the sport of MMA to Canada, and also was one of the first record holders of several different events. Williams was part of a very successful Canadian wrestling team which happened to be one of the top three in Canada at the time. He won Mr. Moncton title in the late 1950s and entered the Guinness Book of World Records in the 1980s. In 1987, Williams set a world record for breaking multiple blocks of ice with a single punch. Each block was 11 inches thick, 22 inches wide, 42 inches long, and were stacked one on top of the other 10 consecutive blocks in a pile. This record still stands today. Some other records in the name of John Williams consists of, 13 consecutive hours of judo throws, over 100 weightlifting records, which include a world record for lifting 505 pounds in the one-handed deadlift at 160 pound bodyweight. Sadly, this record was disproved as the world record for this lift was already achieved in 1920. He fought in kickboxing, amateur and professional boxing, and he competed in both karate and judo. At seventy-years old, Williams decided to set a new record. He wanted to become the oldest professional debuting mixed martial arts fighter in history. However, athletic commissions were opposed to this idea. Williams had to pass a volume of both physical and medical tests to prove it was safe for him to compete in professional mixed martial arts. Williams passed all the tests. Prior to competing against former professional wrestler Larry Brewbaker, Williams wanted to prove a serious point on his insight concerning professional fighting and the association it has with age. Williams emphasized the fact that, \\"as a person becomes a senior, society kind of pushes them out of the loop. The attitude around them is that they're dumb, they can't do anything, physically they're just vegetables, and there sort of shunned by society.\\" Williams wanted to prove that he was not just another senior citizen in society, but that he was capable of achieving victory in a professional fight; which many people thought was impossible at his age. In an interview prior to his match, Williams said, \\"I went and got information on discrimination towards a person because of age, and I realized that if I say this is my job and I’m physically capable of doing the job, there was no way in the world they could stop me. This had nothing to do with risk factors. When you know what you’re doing, MMA is safe. I could have done an amateur thing or an exhibition, but no, I wanted to do a real fight.\\" Record breaking MMA debut match Williams, sporting a long pony-tail, met Larry Brewbaker, 49, a used car salesman with a shaved head and multiple tattoos. Their fight took place in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada,on 24 July 2010, at the \\"Elite 1 – Wild Card\\". The 70-year-old Williams set three records that night. He became the oldest debuting MMA fighter, the oldest active MMA fighter, and the oldest winning MMA fighter. Williams won his match by ankle lock in the 2nd round. In an interview after his record making victory, Williams said, \\"The point of life is living it. And I tell you, I got in that cage and I felt alive. I felt human again. You get that thing over your head, people think you’re 70 and you don’t know [expletive]. They don’t bother to get to know you. I like Eminem. I like rap music. …Mentally, I feel the same as I did when I was 30. I like the same kind of cars, make the same kind of ridiculous claims, and the enjoy same kinds of women. Nothing’s changed for me, but there’s this stereotype. You don’t change, but they try and make you fit a mold and be something you don’t want to be, which is an old person. Not me. I’ve been a fighter all my life.\\" References Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:First Nations sportspeople Category:Canadian male mixed martial artists Category:Abenaki people ","title":"John Williams (mixed martial artist)"},{"id":"34539700","text":"Henri was a 364 burthen ton brig that was wrecked upon Reids Mistake, near the entrance to Lake Macquarie, New South Wales, Australia.

The chapel was finally opened in 1908. Initially, the chapel was used by a Methodist Episcopal church. After that, it was occupied by the Union Church. Owners Pedro Santiago and Catalina Mejía de Santiago gave the building as a present to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan de Puerto Rico on February 17, 1959. Due to its unique architecture and historic nature, the chapel was included on the National Register for Historic Places on September 25, 1984. www2.pr.gov United States Department of the Interior National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places. Retrieved 2016-10-26.'' =Restoration= In 1982, the chapel was already abandoned and deteriorated. Elba Armstrong started an initiative to restore it. Along with members of the Lourdes Association, the restoration project had a cost of $24,300. Armstrong worked with architect Pablo Ojeda O'Neill and with the contributions of private and government entities. In 1987, the final restoration of the 24 stained-glass windows was done with a $13,500 donation of Angel Ramos Foundation. From 1990 to 1991, thanks to a $10,000 donation from the Senate of Puerto Rico, along with $5,000 more from Angel Ramos Foundation, the asbestos portions of the roof were replaced. In 1992, the Jesus and the Children and the Holy Spirit stained-glass windows were restored, with a $22,000 donation from Esso Standard Oil Company. The damaged frame of the windows was also built anew. 1993 saw the altar floor replaced by new wooden floors, identical to the original ones. This was achieved with a $19,000 donation from the Puerto Rican Committee for the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of Puerto Rico. Also, a mosaic similar to the one in the main hall was found and installed in the side hall, the sacristy, and the bathroom. The furniture and the doors from the sacristy were designed by Ojeda and built in mahogany, and the bell was built in Spain.

At some point between 1888 and 1890 the Nine-Mile Circle streetcar arrived, , making a loop of what are now Ponce de Leon Avenue, North Highland Avenue, Virginia Avenue, and Monroe Drive. Atlantans at first used the line to visit what was then countryside, including Ponce de Leon Springs, but the line also enabled later development in the area. Residential development began as early as 1893 on St. Charles and Greenwood Avenues, must most development took place from 1909 through 1926 — solidly upper-middle class neighborhoods, kept all- white by covenant. Virginia–Highland, like most intown Atlanta neighborhoods, suffered decline starting in the 1960s as residents moved to the suburbs. Less-affluent residents moved in, some single-family houses were turned into apartments, and crime increased. What could have been the death knell for the neighborhood sounded in the mid-1960s, when the Georgia Department of Transportation proposed building Interstate 485 through the area. Despite this a few middle-class families began renovating homes in the neighborhood. The neighborhoods like others had formed and kept a strong neighborhood association and a strong identity: the area was now known as Virginia–Highland. The 1980s and 1990s saw the area continue to gentrify, and by 2012 most of the art galleries, antique stores and neighborhood-oriented businesses had given way to a still eclectic collection of retail but which attracted more affluent and less alternative clientele. Virginia–Highland is today one of the most desirable intown neighborhoods and consistently wins awards for favorite neighborhoods. Early settlers In 1812, William Zachary bought and built a farm on of land there. In 1822 he sold his farm to Richard Copeland Todd (1792–1850). Todd's brother-in-law Hardy Ivy settled in 1832 in what is now Downtown Atlanta and the road between their two farms came to be known as Todd Road (a portion of which still exists in Virginia Highland). \\"Nine Mile Circle\\" 1902 map of Atlanta's streetcar network including Nine Mile Circle route In the 1880s, Georgia Railroad executive Richard Peters and real estate developer George Washington Adair organized the Atlanta Street Railway Company. Their first project was the Nine Mile Trolley, which started serving the area sometime between 1888 and 1890 . At first, patrons used this streetcar line to visit \\"the countryside\\" outside the city, but the line also enabled later development in the area. Adair built his home at 964 Rupley Drive (still standing and divided into upscale apartments). The iconic curves in the street at the intersections of Virginia Ave. with N. Highland and Monroe are remnants of the trolley line which required gentle curves. The Trolley Square Apartments (now \\"Virginia Highlands [sic] Apartments\\") near Virginia and Monroe were built on the site of trolley maintenance facilities.

Highland Ave. However, the majority of the houses and streets in Virginia–Highland were constructed between 1909 and 1926. Important subdivisions include: * Highland View (1911) \\\\- Greenwood (north side), Drewry, and Highland View between N. Highland and Barnett; Adair (south side) between N. Highland and Todd Rd. * Vineyard Park (1911) \\\\- built on the grounds of the Adair Mansion - Todd Road (east side), Adair Avenue (north side) and Rupley Drive * North Boulevard Park (phase one from 1916, phase two from 1926), where Cooledge Avenue was named after E.J. Cooledge, vice- president of the North Boulevard Park Corp., and Orme Circle (And later the eponymous park) were names for A.J. Orme, its secretary-treasurer. * Virginia Hills (from 1921) * Virginia Highlands (from 1922) (with an \\"s\\" – note that this was before \\"Virginia Highland\\" came to refer to the entire neighborhood). In 1916 the Arc Light Controversy raged between neighbors on Adair Ave. and N. Highland Ave. Commercial development Some businesses opened around the intersection of Virginia and N. Highland starting in 1908, with many more opening starting in 1925. At the same time development started in the Atkins Park commercial district around St. Charles. Ave. and N. Highland, including in the present-day Atkins Park Restaurant (1922) which reportedly got what is now Atlanta's oldest liquor license when it became a bar and restaurant in 1927. Between 1928 and 1930, the Howard Dry Cleaning Company and the Phelps Millard Grocery opened, anchoring the Amsterdam and N. Highland business district. The Samuel N. Inman School, named after the nineteenth-century cotton merchant, was built in 1923. In 1924, fire station 19 was built on N. Highland at Los Angeles Ave. Streetcar service to Virginia–Highland ended around 1947, along with all of the other trolley lines into and out of central Atlanta. Decline Virginia–Highland, like most intown Atlanta neighborhoods, suffered decline starting in the 1960s as residents moved to the suburbs. Less-affluent residents moved in, some single-family houses were turned into apartments, and crime increased. Some businesses closed and were replaced by lower-rent tenants such as pawn shops. Others, such as Moe's and Joe's (which opened in 1947) and Atkins Park Restaurant, stayed open. Many buildings deteriorated. Threat and defeat of I-485 1970 map of proposed route of I-485 through northeast Atlanta What could have been the death knell for the neighborhood sounded in the mid-1960s, when the Georgia Department of Transportation proposed building Interstate 485 to connect what is now Freedom Parkway through the neighborhood and to what is now Georgia 400 at Interstate 85. It would have included an interchange at Virginia Avenue where John Howell Memorial Park is today. Despite the I-485 proposal moving forward, a few middle-class families began moving back into the neighborhood, renovating homes. In Fall 1971, Joseph (Joe) Drolet and others founded the Virginia–Highland Civic Association (VHCA), whose mission was to defeat I-485, (\\"The Interstate That Almost Was\\", Morningside Lenox Park Association Newsletter, Fall 2003 and registered the association with the Georgia Secretary of State on August 22, 1972. This was the first time that the area now known as Virginia–Highland was defined as a unit with its current boundaries and name. They along with residents of Stone Mountain, Inman Park, and Morningside finally defeated I-485, and became a political force to be reckoned with. The current Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) system is an outgrowth of these events. In 2009, the original north/south freeway (connecting 675 to 400) was again put on GDOT's to-do list, but this time running in a tunnel underneath the neighborhoods, with buildings to vent exhaust fumes and smog above ground. Between 1972 and 1975, property values increased from 20 to 50 percent. Home ownership levels rose 20 percent. A tour of thirteen renovated homes started in 1972. The Georgia Department of Transportation began selling properties it had acquired for I-485, virtually all of them for infill housing. The of land on Virginia Avenue where 11 houses had been taken and demolished to make way for a Virginia Avenue exit, however, was finally opened in 1988 as John Howell Memorial Park, in memory of Virginia–Highland resident and anti-freeway activist John Howell, who died from complications of HIV in 1988. During the 1970s and 1980s the VHCA also worked to improve the city's process of home inspection, to develop a resource network of quality, affordable service providers to aid homeowners in renovation, and to encourage developers to lease renovated commercial buildings \\"as is\\" at low rates in order to encourage new and unique businesses, and thus a truly distinct commercial district. In the early 1980s, Atkins Park restaurant was renovated. Meanwhile, Stuart Meddin bought and renovated the 1925 commercial block at North Highland and Virginia. In 1988, the turn-of-the-century trolley barns on on Virginia Avenue on the east side of the BeltLine (today's Virginia Highland Apartments) were torn down despite the City Council and VHCA's attempts to save them. Although previously assuring local residents that he favored saving the historic structures, Mayor Andrew Young then vetoed the resolution, and the Council's vote of 11-3 was not enough to override it. Young cited the discovery of asbestos in the buildings and other hazardous materials on the property.\\"Proposal to save trolley barns fails by one vote in council\\", October 20, 1987, Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Page A/28Citing asbestos, Young now wants trolley barns razed\\", October 17, 1987, Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Page Number: B/1 Around 2003, the previously separate St. Charles-Greenwood neighborhood was fully absorbed into the Virginia–Highland neighborhood. Metro-wide destination As the neighborhood continued to regentrify, property values increased rapidly; the shops and restaurants became progressively more upscale. Towards the end of the 90s, the neighborhood-oriented character of the business districts gave way to businesses serving patrons from across greater Atlanta. VIrginia–Highland wrestled with traffic and parking issues. Apartments affordable to students became more difficult to find. A spat between organizers of Summerfest in 2000 and the resulting power-play within the civic association threatened the continuation of the festival, the main source of funding for the VHCA's activities.Michael Wall, \\"Will Va-Hi's Summerfest go bye-bye?\\", Creative Loafing, September 16, 2000 However, Summerfest did continue as usual in 2001 as one of Atlanta's highest profile neighborhood festivals. Preservation and balance In November 2006, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation added Virginia–Highland to its list of \\"places in peril\\" due to an acceleration of teardowns and infill projects by real estate developers and newcomers to the area. However, Virginia–Highland remains one of the most architecturally historic, distinct and vibrant neighborhoods in Atlanta. Residents, through the VHCA, succeeded in getting the city council to pass zoning legislation prescribing development that fits the scale of the streets, rolling back loose zoning ordinances passed in the 1960s. The new zoning also prescribes a maximum number of each type of establishment - restaurants, bars, retail and other types. The zoning aims to preserve a vibrant mix of enterprises while keeping control noise, parking and traffic issues but also addresses specific problems which came up in 2005-2008: * Avoiding Virginia Highland suffering the same fate as Buckhead Village, where a large number of bars opened, eventually attracting crime from other areas of the city. * Fighting a liquor permit for the 700-seat Hilan Theatre. * Opposing \\"The Mix@841\\" project at 841 N. Highland Ave., originally proposed to be 80 feet tall. In December 2008 the VHCA bought the land for New Highland Park, a small park at N. Highland and St. Charles. In Autumn 2010, a rash of seven muggings occurred, statistics which were far lower than those of the 1980s when the neighborhood was edgy, but in 2010 shaking up the neighborhood. Partly in response, the local security patrol, FBAC, expanded patrol coverage to the entire neighborhood. Shortly thereafter in Nov. 2010 Charles Boyer was murdered during a mugging, for which the \\"Jack Boys\\" were indicted in Jan. 2011. Police continued to step up patrols and since then Virginia Highland has returned to its status as one of Atlanta's lower-crime neighborhoods. Currently the neighborhood is enjoying adjacent development projects including a new biking and walking trail along the BeltLine from Piedmont Park to Inman Park, as well as the redevelopment of Ponce City Market, the old Sears building, which later became City Hall East. Ponce City Market has become a major multi-use development including a gourmet food hall of national importance and commercial hub. Behind Ponce City Market is the (2011) Historic Fourth Ward Park, founded in 2011.

Traditionally, he is considered to be the student of Tongan Daopi. However, the basis for this belief comes from a text by Huihong called the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan), which was completed in 1119, many years after Tongan's death. History Tongan Guanzhi's name first appears in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, he is not listed as a student of Tongan Daopi. In fact, it states Daopi has no students at all. The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of Tongan Wei, in turn a student of Jufeng Puman, with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp, and neither with much information. However, Dayang Jingxuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, and as such it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi.

His breeder, Lord Egremont, won the Derby for the first time with Assassin. Assassin raced until he was a five-year-old and was retired to Egremont's stud in Petworth. He was not a successful sire. Background Assassin was foaled in 1779, at Lord Egremont's estate Petworth House. Assassin's sire, Sweetbriar, was an undefeated racehorse that earned 5,400 guineas during his racing career for his owner Lord Grosvenor. Sweetbriar stood at Oxcrofts Farm near Balsham. Assassin's dam, Angelica, was foaled in 1761 and was breed by Mr. Shafto, the owner of her sire Snap. Assassin was Angelica's eighth foal and she produced eleven foals between 1768 and 1782, including Assassin's full-sister Medëa. Angelica was euthanised in 1787. Racing career Assassin was trained by F. Neale at Newmarket. Assassin raced until he was five-years-old, winning eight races, and was retired to Lord Egremont's stud at Petworth. =1781: two-year-old season= Derby win was the first for Lord Egremont, who would go on to win the event four more times. In October at Newmarket, Assassin beat the Duke of Grafton's colt Puzzle in a match race at 6 to 4 odds against Assassin. Assassin did not win again as a two-year-old.

Assassin forfeited a match race with the horse Cornwall (later called Boringdon) at the same meeting a few days later, and at the July meeting in Newmarket his owner paid 150 guineas to the owner of Young Eclipse (the 1781 Derby winner) for backing out of a match race. Stud career By 1789, Assassin was still standing at Petworth for a fee of two guineas per mare alongside the more expensive stallions Mercury (10 guineas) and Trentham (3 guineas). For the 1793 breeding season, he was relocated to Langley Park near Colnbrook and stood for a fee of 3 guineas per mare and a five shilling groom's fee. His fee at Langley Park was reduced to two guineas for the 1794 season and he did not appear in the register for 1795. Assassin was not a successful sire. His most notable offspring were the fillies Cow and Rag (foaled in 1786 out of Chanticleer's dam).

After graduating from Brown University and Harvard Business School, he stayed at the business school as an associate dean. After his term as president at Ohio University, he worked at the Boston Company as chairman for several years. Early life Alden was born in April 1923 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Hildur Pauline (Johnson) and Arvid W. Alden, a Protestant minister.https://vineyardgazette.com/obituaries/2020/06/25/vernon-r-alden-97 As a young boy, he attended public school in Illinois and Rhode Island. During World War II, Alden attended the Navy Officers Japanese Language School in Boulder, Colorado, before serving on the aircraft carrier . Alden received a degree in English literature at Brown University and an MBA from Harvard Business School. Work at Ohio University Alden was 38 years old when he came to Ohio University from his position as the associate dean of the Harvard Business School. During his time as president, the enrollment and faculty on the Athens Campus doubled and enrollment in the university’s five branch campuses nearly tripled. During his presidency, Alden oversaw expansion of the campus area through urban renewal. The size of Athens’ campus increased by more than 750 acres. The development of South Green, the completion of West Green, and the construction of a new regional airport all happened during his presidency. His efforts in urban renewal exceeded developing the university and overflowed to improving economic growth in southeastern Ohio. He rerouted the flood-prone Hocking River, which annually drowned the university every spring, constructed the Appalachian Highway Network to provide easier access to Athens for visitors, and built six regional branches of Ohio University in both eastern and southern Ohio. Alden was an advocate for the expansion of research and for new academic programs. He led the development of programs such as the Ohio Fellows Program, the Cutler Program of Individualized Studies, the Honors College, and the Black Studies Institute. In addition to academic programs, Alden implemented university remissions for university employees and their families, sabbatical leaves, and the Ohio University Press. Increased rights for faculty and students were evidenced by a Faculty Senate and Student-Faculty Mediation Board. Vernon attracted President Lyndon B. Johnson to the Athens campus to announce the Great Society Program in May 1964. In 1965, Alden was the subject of a Life Magazine feature showcasing his accomplishments as well as the challenges facing academic administrations in the wake of open admissions policies. Upon his retirement from Ohio University the Board of Trustees dedicated the new library in his name, the Vernon Roger Alden Library. Dr. Alden left the University in 1969. Professional achievements Alden became Chairman of the Boston Company and the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company in 1969. During his tenure, to 1978, the company quadrupled its assets. Alden transformed the company from a somewhat local financial company into an international organization and attracted to its Board of Directors incredibly successful executives including the chief executive officers of Armco Steel, TransWorld Airlines, Continental Oil, Royal Dutch Shell in the United Kingdom, the Dole Company in Hawaii and Lee Iacocca, the then president of Ford. Alden and his associates developed new branches of the Boston Company including the Boston Consulting Group, the Financial Strategies Group, Institutional Investors, Rinfret-Boston Economic Advisory Services, and an oil and gas investment subsidiary in Texas. These new entities allowed the Boston Company to expand outside of Massachusetts to acquire investment counseling firms across the United States. By the end of the 1970s the Boston Company became the United States’ 15th largest investment-management firm. Alden was fascinated by organizations that were hired by incredibly wealthy families like the Rockefellers and the Fords to manage their assets. He recognized that similar assistance was needed by families less wealthy. He took this idea and transformed it into the Financial Strategies Group, an organization created to evaluate the assets of less wealthy families, offer advice on estate planning, manage resources, and enable them to invest. Among his first clients were John Glenn and George Webster. Influence in Japan He became president of the Japan Society of Boston in 1969 and obtained a five-year grant from the US-Japan Friendship Commission. The grant provided the company with the opportunity to hire an Executive Director and to expand the company by increasing membership to more than 2,000 with 150 additional corporate members. Alden has been a member of the Harvard Program on US-Japan Relations, the Massachusetts-Hokkaido Sister State Committee, the Newport-Shimoda Black Ships Festival, and the Boston- Kyoto Sister City Foundation.

In a career that lasted from April 1818 to May 1819 he ran nine times and won three races. In May 1818 he defeated fifteen opponents to record his most important win in The Derby. His only other wins came in a walkover and a match race. After running without success as a four-year-old, Sam was retired to stud but made no impact as a sire of winners. Background Sam was described as a \\"low, lengthy and plain sort of horse, with a sour countenance, and a delicate constitution,\\" sired by the Doncaster Cup winner Scud out of the mare Hyale. Hyale produced several other winners and was a half-sister to Goosander, a highly successful broodmare who produced The Oaks winner Shoveler and the Derby winner Sailor. Sam was bred by his owner, Thomas Thornhill at his stud at Riddlesworth, Norfolk, and trained by Thornhill's father-in-law, Mr Perren. Sam was named after his regular jockey Sam Chifney, Jr. Chifney was one of the outstanding jockeys of his era, and one of the first to hold horses up in the early stages of a race before finishing strongly: he became famous for this tactic which became known as the \\"Chifney Rush\\". He eventually became the joint-trainer of the colt that bore his name. Racing career =1818: three-year-old season= Sam was unraced as a two-year-old and made his debut at Newmarket on 13 April 1818 when he ran in the Riddlesworth Stakes, a race for three-year-olds which at that time was regarded as being equal in status to the Classics. He started at odds of 9/1 and finished unplaced behind Prince Paul. Three days later he was able to record his first \\"win\\" when he was allowed to walk over for a 100 guinea sweepstakes after his only rival, a colt by Walton owned by the Duke of Rutland, was withdrawn from the race. Sam had training problems before the Derby, jeopardising the £15,000 which Thornhill stood to take in winning bets. Despite his lack of a win in a competitive race he started 7/2 second favourite on 28 May at Epsom, with Prince Paul being made 11/5 favourite. There were ten false starts for the race before the starter announced that the next attempt would be the final one, regardless of whether or not the sixteen jockeys were ready. Prince Paul made the early running but tired in the straight and Sam Chifney was able to produce his colt with a late run to win comfortably by three-quarters of a length from an unnamed 50/1 outsider (later named Raby), with Prince Paul third. The hard, dry ground meant that for much of the race the runners were obscured by a cloud of dust. After the race the training of the colt was taken over by Chifney and his older brother William. After a break of four months, Sam returned for the autumn meetings at Newmarket where he ran four times. On 28 September, he ran a 200-guinea match race over a mile against Fitzcloddy, a colt who had finished unplaced at Epsom. Sam started the 2/5 favourite, but failed to concede eight pounds to his opponent. Two days later he started 6/5 favourite for a subscription plate \\"across the flat\\" (ten furlongs), in which he finished second of the eight runners behind Allegro. On 15 October Sam ran in a 200-guinea sweepstakes over a sprint distance of six furlongs and finished last of the three runners behind a filly named Carrots. On his final start of the season, Sam ran a match over ten furlongs against the Duke of Rutland's Walton colt- the same horse that had been withdrawn from the sweepstakes in April. Sam conceded two pounds and defeated his opponent to claim a prize of 200 guineas. =1819: four-year-old season= Sam failed to show any worthwhile form in two races in the spring of 1819. On 15 April he started joint favourite for the two mile Claret Stakes at Newmarket but finished last of the three runners behind Allegro and The Oaks winner Corinne. A month later he finished last of three again in the four-mile Jockey Club Stakes in which he was receiving twenty-three pounds from the winner Cannon- ball. After this race he was sold by Thornhill to a Mr Charlton. Sam did not race again. He was entered for a match race against a filly named Fanny at the Newmarket Craven meeting in April 1820, but did not appear and Mr Charlton paid a forfeit. Stud career Sam began his stud career at Ludford near Ludlow in Shropshire alongside the more established stallion Castrel. His initial fee was 10 guineas for thoroughbred mares or 2 guineas for half-breds. He made no impact as a stallion attracting few mares other than those of Mr Thornhill. His last known foals were conceived in 1827. Pedigree Sam's pedigree contained significant inbreeding. He was inbred 3 × 4 × 4 to Herod, meaning that the stallion appears once in the third generation of his pedigree and twice in the fourth. He was also inbred 4 × 4 × 4 to Eclipse.

His study of the Chinese Revolution and the People's Republic was in conjunction with his strong interest in socialist ideology, Marxism, and Maoism in particular. He authored a number of books including Mao's China: A History of the People's Republic (and subsequent editions) which became a standard academic text in that area. Maurice Meisner was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1931 to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He had two marriages each lasting about 30 years, first to Lorraine Faxon Meisner and subsequently to Lynn Lubkeman. He had three children from the first marriage and one child from the second. He died at his home in Madison, Wisconsin in 2012. Early years Meisner grew up in Detroit during the austere years of the Great Depression and World War II. But by the time he reached adulthood during the post-war boom, Detroit was a thriving center of culture as well as the auto industry. He remained in Detroit, enrolling at Wayne State University. An outstanding student, Meisner was admitted to a graduate program there after only two years of college. However this was also the beginning of the Cold War and the Red Scare in the U.S., having serious repercussions on the personal lives of Maurice Meisner and his wife Lorraine. As part of the McCarthy era investigations, Lorraine was subpoenaed before the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 in relation to her attendance at the World Festival of Youth and Students held in East Berlin the previous year. Like most witnesses called before hearings of HUAC or the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), Lorraine Meisner refused to testify to the body. Although this assertion of her Fifth Amendment rights had no direct legal consequences, David Henry, president of Wayne State University where she was also a student, saw fit to expel her from the university. Although seen as an unusually harsh move even at the time, other schools were reluctant to admit a student dismissed under such circumstances. The Meisners moved to Chicago after they had been accepted to study at the University of Chicago, where they both would eventually receive doctorates. Maurice Meisner undertook to study Chinese history at a time when this would be considered an obscure choice, but where the emerging significance of China might be discerned in the wake of the 1949 revolution and role of China in the Korean War. This included studying the Chinese language to do research and travel in order to collaborate with the rather few China scholars of the time. Meisner's doctoral dissertation was prepared under the Sovietologist Leonard Haimson and developed in further year of research at the East Asian Research Center at Harvard. It was later published by Harvard University Press. In it, Meisner studied the original contributions to Chinese revolutionary theory by the co- founder of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao to show that the adaptation of Marxism to China which had been attributed to Mao Zedong had actually been accomplished by Li.Maurice J. Meisner. Li Ta-Chao and the Origins of Chinese Marxism. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, Harvard East Asian Series, 27, 1967). Maurice Meisner was an early member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS). In addition to opposing American participation in the Vietnam War, the group also involved itself in demystifying China at a time in which \\"Red China\\" was regularly portrayed as a threat to America, arguably surpassing the Soviet Union as a target of anti-communist sentiment toward the end of the 1960s. Meisner wrote for their publication, the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, and at the time of his death in 2012 he was still listed on the advisory board of the journal. Beginning with an article in the 1963 The China Quarterly, he published articles in the leading journals in the field, including Asian Survey, Current History, Journal of Asian Studies, and Modern China, among others.Eight of these articles were collected in Maurice J. Meisner. Marxism, Maoism, and Utopianism : Eight Essays. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1982). . Main career Meisner earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Chicago and was awarded fellowships at Harvard University and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (Stanford, California). In 1968 he left his first faculty position at the University of Virginia to accept a professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he would remain for the rest of his career. He took sabbaticals at the Woodrow Wilson Center (1980) and at the London School of Economics (1999). =Teaching at the University of Wisconsin= In 1968 the nation was in a state of apprehension and unrest given the continuing war in Vietnam and movements for the empowerment of minorities. This was the same year as the Tet Offensive which became widely viewed as a psychological turning point in the Vietnam war and American public opinion, the assassination of Martin Luther King and its aftermath, anti-war protests and police violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and election of Richard Nixon as president. Protest activity on and off the university campuses was reaching a crescendo and Madison happened to be one of the most affected campuses, bolstered by its large student body which in large part came from outside of Wisconsin. Highlights included militant protests against Dow Chemical which produced the napalm used in Vietnam, demonstrations and student strike demanding a Black Studies department at the university, a campus-wide strike by graduate assistants, the nationwide student strike following the 1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia, and the 1970 bombing of the Army Math Research Center also in protest of the war. Radical politics was in the air, bringing to the fore radical organizations and ideologies ranging from anarchism to various Marxist currents. Thus Maurice Meisner began teaching the history of the Chinese revolution not only at the very time when revolutionary politics was being widely explored and debated, but where the specifics of the Chinese revolution seemed very relevant to many radicalizing youth who were hardly enthralled by the nominally Marxist pro-Soviet Communist Party (which threw its electoral support to the Democratic Party). The Chinese Communist Party, in contrast, had denounced the Marxism of the Soviet Union as \\"revisionist,\\" and Maoist groups were prominent among the more militant factions involved in protest actions and ideological debate. Interest in Meisner's Chinese history course was greatly bolstered by this perception of an international revolutionary pole headquartered in China along with Meisner's sympathy with the socialist goals underlying the Chinese revolution. Thus the one-time niche field of Chinese history gave way to a wider politically motivated audience requiring a large lecture hall. 1968 was during the Cultural Revolution in China, which received much fanfare among Western radicals but about which little was actually known. Many Maoists in the West found inspiration in the (perceived) role of the Red Guards, just as the English version of Mao's Red Book became widely toted as a revolutionary handbook. Competing Maoist groups in the U.S. (such as from the breakup of SDS) and the West attached themselves to the legacy of Mao Zedong and the cultural revolution, propelling interest in the recent history of China, the subject of Meisner's continuing research. As various absurdities and abuses committed during the Cultural Revolution became known, reactions of Maoist factions ranged from soul-searching to denial. Of obvious interest was Meisner's related research, although this was at a time when visiting the People's Republic was still impossible (as were visits by Chinese individuals to the West). Despite the difficulty in obtaining objective information, his study of the period made it into the classroom and would be incorporated into his 1977 work Mao's China: A History of the People's Republic. =Post-Mao China= By the late 1970s not only had the earlier wave of campus radicalism subsided, but definite changes were underway in China which were troubling, at best, to the remaining American Maoist currents and the so-called New Communist Movement which had emerged from the remnants of the New Left. Fascination with the cultural revolution had benefited from popular perceptions and slogans at a time when direct contact with Chinese communists was sparse, but in the years following Richard Nixon's China visit that began to change. With the death of Mao and the defeat of the Gang of Four, the political course of China was to rapidly change, whereas Western observers, both on the right and on the left, were often unable or unwilling to recognize the enormity of the transformation that had begun. This was just as Meisner's major work Mao's China was going to press, documenting the history and dynamics of the Chinese revolution up to that point. A subsequent edition of that book published in 1985 included additional chapters addressing the aftermath of the power struggle, but which still saw the market reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping as a tactical turn in the development of socialism. Following some years of China's accelerating economic and political evolution, however, Meisner's assessment of the entire period became more sober as he traced the rise of what he termed \\"bureaucratic capitalism,\\" albeit under the official banner of building \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\\" Indeed, he saw the economic transformations underway as having set the stage for the democracy movement of 1989. The curious evolution of socialist China towards capitalism, all the while maintaining Communist Party rule, was the subject of Meisner's 1996 work The Deng Xiaoping Era: An Inquiry into the Fate of Chinese Socialism, 1978-1994. Meisner was himself in Beijing in 1989 up until a week before the crackdown on the democracy movement. His analysis of the protest movement contradicted both the official characterization of it as a \\"counterrevolutionary rebellion\\" and the Western media's inclination to depict any movement for greater democracy as welcoming of capitalism. Rather than simple concerns for greater democracy, the movement was propelled by a disgust of privilege attained by powerful bureaucrats which was seen as official corruption, and in fact a result of the market reforms. Meisner writes: :[Calls against] \\"Corruption\\" now conveyed a moral condemnation of the whole system of bureaucratic privilege and power.... But now that Communist leaders, high and low, were so deeply enmeshed in profiteering in the presumably \\"free\\" marketplace, they had gone well beyond the bounds of politico-ethical legitimacy in popular perceptions. The use of political power for private gain was viewed as unfair and unjust, and it inflamed slumbering resentments against bureaucratic privilege. =Harvey Goldberg= It was not only students and young people involved in the tumultuous social/political struggles permeating the campus during the 1960s and 70s. The issues rocking the campus naturally created divisions among academics, and most particularly those in history and the other the social sciences where the sorts of issues being played out on the streets were the very subject of academic instruction. In this context one can easily appreciate that Maurice Meisner would have connected to like-minded colleagues in the history department, resulting in a personal friendship with Professor Harvey Goldberg whose study of social movements in modern Europe mirrored Meisner's similar study of contemporary China. Goldberg was very well known and became extremely popular among radical students who would pack his lecture hall as he delivered his memorable orations which often took less the form of history lectures than as passionate political statements. Their friendship endured well past the heyday of campus activism, with them spending considerable time together as Goldberg's health suffered toward the late 1980s. Struck by the death of his friend in 1987, Meisner was instrumental in establishing the Harvey Goldberg Center for the Study of Contemporary History to honor and remember the beloved professor. In the spirit of Harvey Goldberg, the center would go on to sponsor quite a number of speakers, conferences and symposia especially around issues of social concern, connecting the study of history and society with activism as well as maintaining an archive of Goldberg's work. Maurice Meisner assumed the title of Harvey Goldberg Professor of History for the remainder of his university career. Towards the end of his life, in 2009, a conference was held in honor of Meisner's distinguished career entitled \\"Reflections on History and Contemporary Change in China Before and After Tiananmen.\\" The four-day conference, co-sponsored by the Harvey Goldberg Center, included a number of Meisner's former students, now themselves noted scholars of Chinese history. Following that conference three of Meisner's former students undertook to author and edit a book entitled Radicalism, Revolution, and Reform in Modern China: Essays in Honor of Maurice Meisner. The authors presented Meisner with an early copy of the book honoring him in 2011, the year before he died. Major works *Li Ta- Chao and the Origins of Chinese Marxism. Harvard East Asian Series, 27.

It was launched in 2011 and continues to operate. Suomi was originally intended as a pathfinder for the NPOESS program, which was to have replaced NOAA's Polar Operational Environmental Satellites and the U.S. Air Force's Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Suomi was launched in 2011 after the cancellation of NPOESS to serve as a stop-gap between the POES satellites and the Joint Polar Satellite System which will replace them. Its instruments provide climate measurements that continue prior observations by NASA's Earth Observing System. The satellite is named after Verner E. Suomi, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The name was announced on January 24, 2012, three months after the satellite's launch. The satellite was launched from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California by a United Launch Alliance Delta II 7920-10C on October 28, 2011. The satellite was placed into a sun-synchronous orbit 824 km (512 miles) above the Earth. History NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) is intended to bridge the gap between old EOS and new systems by flying new instruments, on a new satellite bus, using a new ground data network. Originally planned for launch five years earlier as a joint NASA/NOAA/DOD project, NPP was to be a pathfinder mission for the larger National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System until DOD participation in the larger project was dissolved. The project continued as a civilian weather forecasting replacement for the NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) series, and ensured continuity of climate measurements begun by NASA's Earth Observing System.http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/sep/HQ_C10-058_JPSS-1_Spacecraft.txt The spacecraft was launched 28 October 2011 from Vandenberg Air Force Base via a Delta II in the 7920-10 configuration (Extra Extended Long Tank with RS-27A engine first stage, 9 GEM-40 solid rocket motors, type 2 second stage with Aerojet AJ10 engine, no 3rd stage and a 10-meter fairing).History of the Delta Launch Vehicle: Description and Designations Additionally, the rocket deployed four CubeSats as a part of NASA ELaNa III manifest.

The unsigned highway runs from MD 28 east and south to Carrolton Road in the Norbeck area of eastern Montgomery County. MD 655 is an L-shaped route with east-west and north-south segments that parallel MD 28 and MD 97, respectively. The highway and its auxiliary routes form parts of service roads along MD 28 and MD 97. The route follows what were two of the original state roads constructed in the early 1910s. MD 655 was assigned to the north-south segment when MD 97 was relocated in the late 1960s. The highway was extended west when MD 28 was relocated in the early 1980s. Route description View north along MD 655 at Carrolton Road near Norbeck MD 655 begins at a ramp from eastbound MD 28 (Norbeck Road) just east of Carrolton Road. The highway heads east as Old MD 28, a one-lane road that closely parallels the eastbound direction of MD 28, with the two roads separated by a row of trees. MD 655 has two ramps to MD 28 and another ramp to the major highway. MD 655 veers away from MD 28 just west of both highways' intersections with MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road). At the MD 655-MD 115 intersection, which serves as MD 115's eastern terminus, MD 655 becomes two-way. The highway continues east until it is adjacent to the MD 28-MD 97 intersection. There, the highway turns south to parallel the southbound lanes of MD 97 (Georgia Avenue), separated by two rows of trees. MD 655 very briefly has a center left-turn lane between Rosecroft Road and Rossmoor Boulevard, which provides access to MD 97 and Leisure World. The highway veers away from MD 97 but continues to parallel the major highway to its terminus at Carrolton Road. The roadway continues beyond a guardrail that restricts traffic to the three houses beyond before the pavement ends just north of Bel Pre Road. History Norbeck Road west of Norbeck and the Seventh Street Pike, which later became an extension of Georgia Avenue, were included in the original state road system developed by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. Norbeck Road from the old turnpike west toward Rockville was under construction in 1911 and completed in 1912. The Seventh Street Pike was built through Norbeck in 1914. Both highways were constructed as macadam roads. Between 1924 and 1926, both highways were expanded to with a pair of concrete shoulders. Norbeck Road and the Seventh Street Pike from Norbeck toward Olney were designated MD 28 in 1927. The Seventh Street Pike was designated MD 97 by 1933 and the MD 28 designation was truncated at Norbeck by 1946. In 1966, a new highway was constructed directly to the east of the MD 97 from Carrolton Road to just north of MD 28. By 1972, MD 97 was moved to the new roadway and MD 655 was assigned to the old section of Georgia Avenue. MD 97 was expanded to a divided highway from just north of Bel Pre Road to just north of MD 28 in 1981. MD 28 itself was expanded to a divided highway, with some relocation of the mainline and addition of service roads, from Baltimore Road east to MD 97 in 1983. MD 655 was extended west along the old alignment of MD 28 as a service road. The highway was named Old MD 28 by 1999, despite most of the highway never having been part of MD 28. Junction list Auxiliary routes MD 655 has eight unsigned auxiliary routes, all of which have existed since at least 1999. *MD 655A is the designation for an unnamed highway that parallels the southbound side of MD 97 from MD 28 to MD 97 at its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 200 (Intercounty Connector). The two-lane road begins at an intersection with westbound MD 28, heads north, then turns east, then turns north again to closely parallel MD 97. MD 655A becomes one-way northbound at Thistlebridge Drive. The highway veers away from MD 97, then turns east at a park and ride facility serving MTA Maryland commuter buses and ends at MD 97. The east leg of the intersection is a ramp to eastbound MD 200. MD 655A formerly had a length of , was entirely two- lanes, and had a cul-de-sac at its northern end. In 2004, the highway was shortened to and made one-way north of Thistlebridge Drive, with a terminus at MD 97. MD 655A was shortened again and its northern terminus placed in its present form in 2010 in conjunction with MD 200 construction. *MD 655B is the designation for Old MD 28, which runs from a ramp from eastbound MD 28 just east of Westbury Road to Carrolton Road just south of MD 28. MD 655B is one- lane eastbound and includes a pair of intermediate ramps to and from eastbound MD 28. *MD 655C is the designation for Old MD 28, which runs from a ramp from eastbound MD 28 just east of Bel Pre Road to Westbury Road. MD 655C is one- lane eastbound and has no intermediate ramps. *MD 655D is the designation for Norbeck Road, which runs between a pair of cul-de-sacs parallel to westbound MD 28 on either side of Hannans Way. The segment on the west end and the segment on the east end are state maintained; the portion in the middle is maintained by Montgomery County. *MD 655E is the unnamed ramp from westbound MD 28 to a service road that parallels the highway from just west of Emory Lane to Rocking Spring Drive. *MD 655F is the unnamed ramp from westbound MD 28 to a service road that parallels the highway from just west of Rocking Spring Drive to Bauer Drive. *MD 655G is the unnamed two-way ramp from eastbound MD 28 to a service road that parallels the highway west of Nadine Drive. The ramp also provides access to a church. *MD 655H is the unnamed ramp from eastbound MD 28 to a service road that parallels the highway from just east of Nadine Drive to Bel Pre Road.

Eglwysilan Church The Church at Eglwysilan The church in its landscape History of the parish During the 12th Century Norman invasion of Wales, the formal parish was defined – an area of more than , including Caerphilly.History Page on official parish website, accessed 30 January 2012 The parish church of Saint Ilan was built on the ridge between the Taff Valley and Aber Valley, on what was thought to have been the site of an earlier chapel or monastic cell. The parish website speculates that it may originally have been the home of a 6th Century monk. The site lies on the ancient pilgrimage route from Llantarnam to Penrhys.The Cistercian Way: Llantarnam to Penrhys , accessed 30 January 2012 Originally Roman Catholic, the church became Anglican following the Reformation caused by Henry VIII. In due course, eleven Anglican parishes were founded from it, causing a reduction in the territory remaining with the mother church.GenUKI page 'Eglwysilan', accessed 30 January 2012, which quotes A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales by Nicholas Carlisle, London, 1811. In 1801, the parish had dependent chapels at Llanfabon and St Martin. The resident population was reckoned to number 1885 people, 'residing in the hamlets of Eglwys Ilan, Ener Glynn, Glynn Tâff, Hendredenny, Parc, Rhyd y Byddin, and The Town of Caerphilly'. In 2012, the parish website stated the parish contained 8,000 people 'serving all of the Aber Valley and including the villages of Abertridwr and Senghenydd together with the hamlets of Eglwysilan and Groeswen'. Today, the hamlets of Pen-y-Groes, Eglwysilan and Groeswen are affluent commuter villages house prices significantly above the local average; the communities are inhabited by professionals with a high level of bilingualism. The churchyard contains the grade II* listed tomb of the bridge builder William Edwards and many of the victims of the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster of 1913. Evan James, who wrote the lyrics of the Welsh National Anthem, was baptised at the church. Identity of the patron saint :Note that this section discusses a saint whose name is Ilan with a capital (Ilan), which could easily be confused with the Welsh term Llan (Llan), which commonly indicates a church or place named after a saint. The dedication of the church is ambiguous. Its own website currently states it to be the church of 'Saint Ilan' (Ilan). Rice Rees offers the opinion that Ilan may have been an early Celtic saint of whom no other trace survives.An Essay on the Welsh Saints, or the Primitive Christians usually considered to have been the founders of churches in Wales. Revd Rice Rees, Longman &c.;, 1836, pages 99, 104, 267. The Cistercian Way website offers an unsourced tradition that Ilan may have been a pre-Norman bishop of Llandaf, and says that the 12th Century Book of Llandaf denotes the church at Eglwysilan as the resting place of the relics of Ilan.The Cistercian Way: Eglwysilan page , accessed 30 January 2012 Rees is sceptical of an 18th-century reference in Ecton's Thesaurus,Thesaurus Rerum Ecclesiasticarum, compiled by John Ecton 1754, with additions by Browne Willis in 1763 which suggests that 'Ilan' is a corrupt form of Helen, mother of Constantine I; nevertheless, the post- reformation Roman Catholic parish erected to cover the same territory in the 20th Century took the name of 'Saint Helen'.Registers at the Roman Catholic Church of St Dyfrig, accessed 30 January 2012 Although Rees acknowledges that the 4th Century noblewoman Elen Luyddog may have become confused with the Empress Helena in historical records, he does not explicitly suggest Elen as a candidate for the patronage of Eglwysilan. In a text from 1801, the parish was said to be dedicated to 'Saint Elian'. There existed a fifth-century saint, Elian, active in north Wales and in Cornwall; Rees acknowledges his presence in north Wales under the name Elian Geimiad, but again, does not propose this saint as a patron of Eglwysilan.

In such micro-habitats, he often discovered nematodes and mites as well as some other organisms. He supervised students, who studied these organisms in detail. That way, his students became specialists for designated animal groups. They formed the so-called \\"Stammer-School\\". Besides free living and non-parasitic organisms, Stammer also made research in the field of parasitology. The evolutionary biologist Günther Osche started his career with a nematode- research (genus Rhabditis) having Stammer as his scientific supervisor .

In the 1960s and 1970s, although many American and Canadian families were living in the city, there were no schools offering a North American curriculum and instruction style. The only option was a boarding school, but this idea did not appeal to Eloise R Bennett and her family.

With no schooling options they opened their own school, and so was born the then American Community School in a garage on Millers Road.  Curriculum  The school is accredited by the University of Cambridge International Examinations Syndicate. The school is also a Cambridge International Examination Centre along with being a centre for the International Baccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations.

It is responsible for some of Australia's best-known and most successful films, including the four Mad Max films, the two Babe films, and the two Happy Feet films. Kennedy Miller Mitchell is one of Australia's oldest existing film production companies, and the most successful internationally. Many of the films are directed by the co- founder, George Miller, though he sometimes takes an organisational role and prefers to use someone else to direct, as with Babe, which was directed by Chris Noonan.Australian Broadcasting Corporation Transcript: \\"Miller unhappy with local film industry despite 'Happy Feet' – Kerry OBrien speaks with George Miller\\" broadcast 29 November 2006. The company's most recent project was the fourth Mad Max film, titled Mad Max: Fury Road. After being \\"in development hell for 25 years\\", the film was released to critical acclaim on 15 May 2015. History Byron Kennedy, who was a film school lecturer at the time, and George Miller first met at a summer film school in Australia in 1971. They began making short features and experimental work, including Violence in the Cinema, Part 1, which Byron produced, photographed and edited, and which won two Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards. In 1978, Kennedy and Miller formed the production company Kennedy Miller Productions, which produced their first feature film, Mad Max. The success of the film allowed them to establish Hollywood contacts, and work in the US as well as in Australia. In July 1983, Byron Kennedy was killed when the helicopter he was piloting crashed. Miller's first reaction was to back away from film making without Kennedy's input, but he decided to continue, and created a sizeable body of TV productions during the 1980s and 1990s, among them the six-part series The Dismissal (1983), the seven-part series Bodyline (1984), the six- part series The Cowra Breakout (1984), the ten-part series Vietnam (1987) with Nicole Kidman, the three-part series Bangkok Hilton (1989), and the five-part series The Dirtwater Dynasty (1989). In 1994, the company took court action against Australian television broadcaster Nine Network over a contracted creative rights dispute. Kennedy Miller received a payout of $8.1 million. In 1995, the company had a major success with the film Babe, the story of a pig who thinks it is a sheepdog. The film used cutting-edge animal animatronic and visual effects created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, John Cox's Creature Workshop and Rhythm and Hues. Along with visual effects supervisor Scott E. Anderson they were awarded the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Babe was the second largest grossing film at the Australian box office after Crocodile Dundee. In 2006 the company had another big success with Happy Feet, which topped the US box office. In 2007, the company formed a partnership with Australian production and media services outfit the Omnilab Media Group, to launch a digital production company. In 2009, the company was renamed Kennedy Miller Mitchell, thus recognising the role played by longtime staff member Doug Mitchell. In 2011, the company made a strategic move towards video game creation, and plans to make games for its own films. The company has taken on staff from two Australian game developers that have collapsed, Krome Studios and Team Bondi. In early 2013, the company closed down their video game studio, KMM Interactive Entertainment, and ceased production on Whore of the Orient, which was going to be the next title from the devs behind L.A. Noire. After the studio closed down, the remaining devs formed an indie studio called Intuitive Game Studios, which would act as a successor to both Team Bondi and the KMM studio.

Built in 1899 for the Ward Line as SS Havana, she would later serve the building of the Panama Canal as SS Panama and ultimately enter Alaskan service as SS Aleutian. Ward Line service In 1898 the Ward Line ordered two ships from William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company in Philadelphia as part of a modernization plan in response to increased passenger and freight demand. The new passenger ship SS Havana was delivered in 1899 and briefly saw military transport service (Official Number 96435) during the Spanish–American War moving two infantry units from Havana, Cuba to Savannah, Georgia. She soon joined the company's steamers linking New York with Nassau, Havana, and Mexican Gulf ports. Panama Railroad Steamship Company service SS Panama in the Culebra Cut on 7 February 1915 – the first excursion to go through the Panama Canal.Havana was sold to the Panama Railroad Steamship Company on behalf of the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1905. She was renamed SS Panama and would serve a crucial role in the construction of the Panama Canal. The steamship company was already running connecting service with New York and San Francisco. It also ran a Central American line of steamships linking Nicaragua, Costa Rica, San Salvador, and Guatemala to Panama City. The shipping service was greatly expanded as canal construction began. The line's heyday was during the construction period; once the canal was finished in 1914 the service shifted to the business of supporting the maintenance and operation of the canal and its supporting infrastructure, including the railroad. Alaska Steamship Company service In February 1927 Panama was sold to the Alaska Steamship Company and transferred to Pacific coastal service. Renamed SS Aleutian after the volcanic Aleutian Islands that stretch westward from the Alaska Peninsula, the vessel received a complete overhaul and refit in Seattle. At this time she likely would have been converted from a coal- to an oil-fired vessel. Contemporary reports described her as palatial and she became the steamship company's flagship. She entered the company's Alaska service carrying freight, passengers and mail service from Seattle. On 26 May 1929 Aleutian was steaming into Uyak Bay () on the coast of Kodiak Island in clear weather with good visibility when she suddenly shook throughout her hull. She had struck a submerged pinnacle rock off the south end of Amook Island () that had torn into her. She sank just seven minutes after impact. One crew member was lost when he went below to retrieve his lucky horseshoe, but the other 153 people on board – 39 passengers and 114 crewmen – made it off and survived. A small motorboat took a few of the passengers to Larsen Bay, from which a cannery tender was dispatched to pick up the rest of the survivors and bring them to Larsen Bay as well. After all the survivors had reached Larsen Bay, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey survey ship met them there and transported them all to Seward in Southcentral Alaska.alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (A) Wreck discovery and conservation Aleutian was thought to have sunk in very deep water and no salvage had been attempted. In 1998 shipwreck historian Steve Lloyd researched the testimony from the Marine Board of Inquiry hearing that had been conducted after the sinking of Aleutian. Reconstructing testimony given by Aleutians officers he estimated the course of the ship just before the pinnacle rock had inflicted its mortal blow. In 2002 he began a side-scan sonar and a magnetometer search of the sea floor beginning at the rock that had sunk the ship. (The rock was later marked with a navigation aid and named Aleutian Rock to honor the deceased crew member.) On 14 August 2002 the searchers found a metallic target on the seabed. The discovery was confirmed when a diver descended for an inspection. On the bottom, still upright, lay Aleutian. Her wreck is located just off the southern tip of Amook Island, about midway down the length of Uyak Bay at Kodiak Island. In 2003 Lloyd sought salvage rights to the wreck. \\"The cargo's still in the hold. The furniture is still in the stateroom ... spittoons still in the gentlemen's smoking room…Portions of the superstructure have collapsed, and almost all the wood is gone. But sections of the deck were steel and are still there.\\" In 2004 the wreck site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In December 2005 the state of Alaska and the discoverer's exploration company reached a settlement that would allow artifact recovery in compliance with state's Office of History and Archeology and environmental regulations. Aleutian is slowly deteriorating from the effects of saltwater corrosion and time. Despite the ship's rapid sinking and time underwater she is nonetheless remarkably intact. The depth, current, and low visibility of her resting place makes her accessible only to experienced deep-wreck divers with advanced training and certification.

The film debuted on ABC on January 29, 2012. John Corbett stars in this film based on the 2002 memoir of the same title by teacher Mike Kersjes and Joe Layden. The movie shows the challenges Kersjes faced as he worked to bring out the best from his special education students by taking them to Space Camp, which had, until that time been perceived as a program best suited to advanced science and math students, well beyond the reach of special education students. Several actors playing students in the film have Down syndrome, autism and/or learning disabilities. Plot Ben, a student with Down syndrome, in Mike Kersjes's Forest Hills Northern High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan, special education class, dreams of becoming an astronaut. Kersjes, who is also a football coach is inspired to pursue Space Camp for his students. Obstacles mount as school administrators object to the expense and Space Camp officials have no experience with special-ed students. Teacher Robynn McKinney supports Kersjes's efforts. Eventually the trip is approved by the necessary parties, and Kersjes faces another set of challenges: fundraising, preparing the students for their trip with science and physical education, and battling bullying and belittling from other students. Kersjes engages the football team in these endeavors.

Gameplay is similar to that of Boggle—players try to find as many words as possible in a jumbled 4x4 grid of letters by connecting adjacent letters to form words within a two-minute time frame - though with extra features and a different scoring system. Words may be formed vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.Jason Parker, Scramble with Friends a worthy hit in the iTunes App Store, CNET, 25 January 2012. Scramble with Friends is one of the top ranking games in the iOS application store, available as both a free ad-supported version and an ad-less paid version.Danny Cowan, Newtoy's Scramble with Friends tops iPad sales chart, Gamasutra, 23 January 2012. Scramble with Friends replaced Scramble Challenge at the end of 2011, but did not retain the solitaire option of the latter. Players can play the game in one of four modes: head-to-head (against a friend), daily challenge, tournaments (against several other real-time competitors), and solo play. Each game consists of three rounds played in series and the winner is the player with the highest total score of all three rounds. The second round introduces tiles with double letter and word multipliers, the third round triple multipliers. The scoring system favors both longer words and words containing less common letters. There are four power-ups which players may employ: 'Freeze' grants the player a few seconds of extra time, 'Inspiration' highlights words for the player to play, 'Scramble' rotates/flips the board granting the player a new perspective, and 'Vision' gives the player 3 words to find and if all words are found, gives the player a time bonus. A token system operates, players must pay one token per round and a second token if they wish to use two powerups in a round rather than one. A new token is earned every 20 minutes (regardless of whether the app is open). Extra tokens are available for purchase, and the paid ad-free version boasts a faster token earning rate (1 token every 10 minutes). Players may sign in through Facebook and invite friends to play, search for opponents by username or be matched with random users. In addition, there is a chat feature built in the game that allows chat between opponents. In June 2015, the game was rebranded as Word Streak with Friends as part of a major update.  Boggle with Friends  In 2017, Zynga officially licensed Boggle, and released Boggle with Friends. Boggle with Friends offers the same game play with new features and enhancements, and shares its games database as Word Streak with Friends and likewise, with Scramble with Friends (a player can start a game in one app and finish it in the other). The major differences between the two are the names, graphics, color schemes, and that Boggle with Friends continues to receive new updates.

Plot The story begins with Fiorello Bodoni, a poor junkyard owner, who spends his nights admiring nearby rocket launches bound for the Moon, Venus, and Mars. After six years, he has finally saved enough money to send one of his family members to Mars. However, when he presents the opportunity to his wife and children, they quickly realize that none could bear the guilt of experiencing such a wonderful journey while the rest stay behind. Bodoni dejectedly returns to his business, but after a stroke of luck, is offered the chance to purchase a mock-up rocket. He decides to spend his savings on the mock-up and secretly spends the night building a replica rocket with a theater in the cabin using color film, mirrors, and screens. He then excitedly tells his family that they will all be able to make the journey to Mars and back. Despite his wife's hesitations, he takes his children on a convincing trip to outer-space, one that they say they will \\"remember... for always.\\" In the end, his wife realizes what a wonderful memory he has given their children, even though the rocket never left the ground, and agrees to share a short trip in the rocket with him in the future.

Puzzles, games and mazes are interspersed throughout the story and the covers are often unconventional, featuring abstract imagery, tessellations and optical illusions in support of the surreal themes.

In Freud and Philosophy, Ricœur interprets Freud's work in terms of hermeneutics, the theory of the rules that govern the interpretation of a particular text, and discusses phenomenology, a school of philosophy founded by Edmund Husserl. He addresses questions such as the nature of interpretation in psychoanalysis, the understanding of human nature to which it leads, and the relationship between Freud's interpretation of culture and other interpretations. The book was first published in France by Éditions du Seuil, and in the United States by Yale University Press. Ricœur explores what he considers a tension in Freud's work between an emphasis on \\"energetics\\", which explains psychological phenomena in terms of quantities of energy, and an emphasis on hermeneutics. He compares Freud to the philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche, describing the trio as a \\"school of suspicion\\", and explores similarities and differences between psychoanalysis and phenomenology. He also compares Freud's ideas to those of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, criticizes Freud's views on religion, discusses language, and further develops ideas about symbols explored in his earlier work The Symbolism of Evil (1960). In response to criticism of the scientific status of psychoanalysis by philosophers such as Ernest Nagel, Ricœur argues that psychoanalysis should be understood not as an observational science, but as an \\"interpretation\\" that resembles history rather than psychology. He criticizes psychoanalysts for failing to adopt this as their response to arguments that psychoanalysis is unscientific. One of Ricœur's most noted works, Freud and Philosophy has been compared to the philosopher Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization (1955), the classicist Norman O. Brown's Life Against Death (1959), the sociologist Philip Rieff's Freud: The Mind of the Moralist (1959), and the philosopher Jürgen Habermas's Knowledge and Human Interests (1968). Commentators have praised Ricœur's discussion of Freud's theories, his exploration of usually neglected aspects of Freud's work, his comparison of Freud to Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche, and his discussion of phenomenology. However, Freud and Philosophy became controversial. While the work was well received in France, it was also criticized there because phenomenology had become unfashionable by the time it was published. The work angered the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who accused Ricœur of borrowing his ideas without attribution; although scholars have rejected the accusation, Lacan's followers attacked Ricœur. Freud and Philosophy received positive reviews upon the publication of its English translation in 1970. The book was described as one of the most important discussions of psychoanalysis and Ricœur was praised for his discussion of symbols. He was also credited with convincingly criticizing Freud's views on both symbols and religion generally. However, some critics have argued that Ricœur's views imply the impossibility of scientifically evaluating psychoanalysis. Summary Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Ricœur argues that Freud's work should be interpreted in terms of hermeneutics. =Preface= Ricœur explains that his subject is Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, rather than psychoanalysis itself, and that he therefore avoids discussing psychoanalytic literature subsequent to Freud and dissident figures such as the psychiatrist Carl Jung. He stresses that Freud and Philosophy is a work of philosophy and not a work of psychology, and compares his enterprise to those of philosophers such as Roland Dalbiez in Psychoanalytical Method and the Doctrine of Freud (1936) and Herbert Marcuse in Eros and Civilization (1955), as well as to those of the sociologist Philip Rieff in Freud: The Mind of the Moralist (1959) and the psychoanalyst John Flügel in Man, Morals and Society (1945). Like Marcuse, Rieff, and Flügel, he considers psychoanalysis an \\"interpretation of culture\\", but unlike them his principal concern is the \\"structure of Freudian discourse\\". He identifies his main purposes as explaining the nature and purpose of interpretation in psychoanalysis, showing to what understanding of human nature psychoanalytic interpretation leads, and exploring whether or how Freud's interpretation of culture is compatible with other interpretations. He notes that by discussing these questions he further explores unresolved issues related to symbols raised in his earlier work The Symbolism of Evil. =Book I: Problematic: The Placing of Freud= Ricœur relates his discussion of Freud to the emphasis on the importance of language shared by philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, schools of philosophy, such as phenomenology, a movement founded by Edmund Husserl, and English linguistic philosophy—as well as disciplines such as New Testament exegesis, comparative religion, anthropology, and psychoanalysis. Ricœur argues that there is a need for a \\"comprehensive philosophy of language\\" to explain its diverse purposes, and that psychoanalysts should participate in discussion of language. Edmund Husserl, the founder of the philosophical movement of phenomenology, which Ricœur compares to psychoanalysis. He maintains that one of Freud's objectives was \\"a reinterpretation of all psychical productions pertaining to culture, from dreams, through art and morality, to religion\\". Discussing Freud's theory of dreams, he writes that Freud used dreams as a model for all disguised expressions of human desire. He argues that psychoanalysis is concerned not with desires themselves but rather the language in which they are conveyed, that it involves a \\"semantics of desire\\", and that psychoanalytic concepts such as repression and cathexis express dynamics or \\"energetics\\" that are \\"articulated only in a semantics\\". He writes that Freud's examinations of dreams and related phenomena such as humor, mythology, and religion, shows that they are meaningful and concern the way in which desires \\"achieve speech\\". He concludes that psychoanalysis offers a new approach to speech. In Ricœur's view, Freud's work suggests that language resembles dreams, in the sense that it \\"means something other than what it says\\" and expresses \\"double meaning\\". According to Ricœur, dreams and phenomena comparable to them, including both insanity and human culture in general, involve \\"significations where another meaning is both given and hidden in an immediate meaning\\", which he equates with the symbol. Comparing the way in which psychoanalysis addresses \\"double meaning\\" to that of the phenomenology of religion, he identifies both similarities and differences between the two approaches. In his view, the primary difference is that phenomena that psychoanalysis views as distorted reflections of basic desires are regarded by the phenomenology of religion as \\"the revelation of the sacred\\". The relative merits of these views are one of his major concerns. He argues that psychoanalysis is concerned with \\"the hermeneutic field\\", which concerns double meanings and the confrontation between different forms of interpretation. He defines \\"hermeneutics\\" as \\"the theory of the rules that preside over an exegesis—that is, over the interpretation of a particular text, or of a group of signs that may be viewed as a text\\", adding that exegesis can be understood to include the interpretation of things analogous to texts. He proposes that \\"the problem of symbolism\\" is to a large extent coextensive with that of language. In Ricœur's view, Freud's work can be compared to that of the philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. He refers to the trio as masters of the \\"school of suspicion\\", arguing that despite their differences, the apparent incompatibility of their ideas, and despite caricatures or misunderstandings of their conclusions, they all view consciousness primarily as false consciousness, seeking to explain its process and provide a means of deciphering it, with the objective of extending consciousness. He views all of them as being fundamentally opposed to the \\"phenomenology of the sacred\\" and to \\"hermeneutics understood as the recollection of meaning and as the reminiscence of being\\". Karl Marx, the founder of Marxism. Ricœur writes that Marx and Freud are masters of the \\"school of suspicion\\". =Book II: Analytic: Reading of Freud= Ricœur explains that in the second section of the book he discusses psychoanalysis in relation to other perspectives primarily to show how it differs from or is opposed to them. He argues that it can be understood as both an \\"energetics\\", in that it entails \\"an explanation of psychical phenomena through conflicts of forces\\", and a \\"hermeneutics\\", in that it entails an \\"exegesis of apparent meaning through a latent meaning\\". He discusses Freud's theories of the death drive, the defence mechanisms, homosexuality, the id, ego and super-ego, identification, the libido, metapsychology, narcissism, the Oedipus complex, the pleasure principle, the preconscious, the psychic apparatus, psychosexual development, the reality principle, sublimation, the transference, the unconscious, as well as dreamwork, Freud's seduction theory, and the method of free association. He suggests that in The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud did not succeed in reconciling the \\"language of meaning\\" and the \\"quasi-physical language\\" implied by different parts of his theory. He notes that for Freud, dreams provide the \\"ultimate proof\\" of the existence of the unconscious, since in Freud's view the dreamwork's activity of distortion makes it necessary to attribute to the unconscious both a distinct place in the structure of the mind and its own set of laws. He considers the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious \\"totally unphenomenological\\". He also sees a fundamental contrast between Husserl's epoché, which involves a \\"reduction to consciousness\\", and the procedures of psychoanalysis, which involve a \\"reduction of consciousness\\". He argues that the contrast is the result of Freud's emphasis on instinct, which displaces an emphasis on the role of the subject and the object in consciousness, and observes that Freud realized that by using the concept of instinct to \\"relate empirical facts\\", he had moved from description to systematization, and that this involved the use of postulates. He elaborates that Freud's postulates included those concerned with the operation of the psychic apparatus, which in Freud's view was regulated by qualities of \\"pleasure-unpleasure\\", which in turn depended on \\"the amounts of stimulus ... affecting mental life\\". Friedrich Nietzsche. Ricœur argues that Nietzsche, like Freud and Marx, is a master of the \\"school of suspicion\\". Observing that, for Freud, the object of instincts must be understood in terms of their aim and not the reverse, he adds that the object may be either something external to a person or part of his or her own body. He credits Freud with making these discoveries in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905). He provides examples of how Freud attempted to explain the process by which instincts change their objects in his theories of narcissism and identification, observing that, for Freud, explaining narcissism meant showing that \\"not only is the object a function of the aim of an instinct, but the ego itself is an aim of instinct\\". He writes that, in Freud's view, narcissism has to be understood through its secondary expressions, such as the perversion \\"in which one's own body is treated as an object of love\\", and that the theory of narcissism helped Freud to show that displacement of narcissism is the basis of \\"the formation of ideals\\" and thus has implications for the theory of identification. He notes that, for Freud, identification is based in the oral stage of development and modeled after the act of devouring. He argues that it was important for Freud that he decide whether it involves a desire to possess something or a desire to be like something, since only the former could be traced to oral origins. Following earlier commentary, Ricœur maintains that Freud uses different sets of terms, including an \\"observational\\" set concerned with observable phenomena and a \\"theoretical\\" set concerned with phenomena that cannot be observed, including various hypothesized forces. He maintains that the conflict between hermeneutics and an incompatible discourse of \\"economics\\", involving quantities of energy, persisted in Freud's work after The Interpretation of Dreams, and concludes that in it, \\"the language of force can never be overcome by the language of meaning\\". According to Ricœur, psychoanalytic claims about religion are shaped by both the \\"topographic- economic model\\" of Freudian metapsychology and by the example of dreams. He argues that aspects of Freud's views on religion, such as his \\"radical questioning\\" of it, merit the consideration of both religious believers and non-believers, despite potential misunderstandings by both groups. He also proposes that psychoanalysis can co-exist with \\"purified\\" religious faith. However, he questions Freud's analogy between religion and neurosis, as well as the accuracy of some of his claims about the history of religion. Freud's hypothesis of the death instinct, put forward in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), is criticized by Ricœur, who describes it as speculative and as resting on a limited factual basis. He draws connections between Freud's ideas about the death instinct and his views about the structure of the mind as presented in The Ego and the Id (1923). =Book III: Dialectic: A Philosophical Interpretation of Freud= Ricœur explains that the third section of the book is concerned with criticism of Freud's ideas. He summarizes his approach as involving first examining the validity of psychoanalysis from the standpoint of epistemology, then exploring its concepts through elaborating an \\"archaeology of the subject\\". He adds that he then integrates this \\"archaeology\\" with a \\"teleology\\" in a way that suggests the possibility of interrelating these \\"opposed hermeneutics\\". Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Ricœur compares the ideas of Hegel and Freud. He compares psychoanalysis to both scientific psychology and phenomenology, arguing that it cannot be made part of a \\"general psychology\\". He writes that most philosophers who have discussed psychoanalysis have concluded that it fails to satisfy the basic requirements of a scientific theory. He credits Ernest Nagel with presenting the strongest such argument, summarizing it as follows. It is questionable whether psychoanalysis is subject to empirical verification, since some its concepts are so vague and metaphorical, and have such an unclear relevance to behavior, that it appears impossible to either deduce specific conclusions from them or explain how psychoanalysis itself could be refuted. Furthermore, there is no way of showing that psychoanalytic interpretations are valid because psychoanalytic data cannot be separated from the relationship of a given analyst to his or her patients and the suspicion that interpretations are forced upon the data by analysts is unavoidable given the lack of comparative procedures and statistical investigation. Between them, these problems make it impossible for independent inquirers to obtain the same data under carefully standardized circumstances or for psychoanalysts to establish objective procedures to decide which conflicting interpretations might be correct. Claims made by psychoanalysts about the effectiveness of treatment are unavailing, since the percentages of improvement cannot be strictly established or defined by appropriate studies, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of psychoanalysis to other methods of treatment. In Ricœur's view, such arguments are convincing so long as psychoanalysis is considered an observational science. He argues that psychoanalysts should, but have not, respond by presenting psychoanalysis as an \\"interpretation\\" that resembles history rather than psychology. He argues that while some psychoanalysts have tried to reformulate psychoanalysis so that it meets scientific criteria acceptable to psychologists, aspects of Freudian theory make this difficult. He refers to the attempt to assimilate psychoanalysis to observational psychology as the \\"operational\\" reformulation of psychoanalysis. He writes that such efforts at operationalization have not satisfied psychologists. He nevertheless argues that they are legitimate, writing that it is desirable for psychoanalysis to be evaluated by psychology and that attempts should be made to validate or invalidate its results. However, he emphasizes that such reformulation of psychoanalysis is \\"a second operation with respect to the experience on the basis of which the Freudian concepts have arisen\\" and as such can only deal with results that are \\"detached from the analytic experience\\". Emphasizing the importance of the difference between the concepts of psychoanalysis and those of behavioral psychology, Ricœur endorses the philosopher Stephen Toulmin's argument that an explanation of human behavior in terms of motives is different in kind from an explanation of human behavior in terms of causes, and that psychoanalysis deals with motives rather than causes. He maintains that because psychoanalysis is concerned with motive concepts, there is a clear distinction between it and observational science. Criticizing the idea that psychoanalysis resembles an experimental science, he emphasizes, following the work of Jacques Lacan, that an analysis is based on verbal interactions between a psychoanalyst and a patient and that it reveals \\"another language, dissociated from common language, and which presents itself to be deciphered through its meaningful effects\\" such as symptoms and dreams. He maintains that psychoanalytic theory is thus concerned with \\"analytic experience, insofar as the latter operates in the field of speech\\". He critiques Freud's theories concerning sublimation, arguing that they suffer from multiple problems and that sublimation is an \\"empty concept\\", as well as his views on language. He also discusses the relationship between Freud's ideas and those of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, comparing the role that desire plays in both men's work. Background and publication history According to Ricœur, Freud and Philosophy originated in the Terry Lectures given at Yale University in 1961, and was also developed in lectures given at the University of Louvain in 1962. The book was first published in French in May 1965 by Éditions du Seuil, as part of the series L'Ordre philosophique (The Philosophic Order). In 1970, an English translation by Denis Savage was published in hardcover by Yale University Press. A paperback edition followed in 1977. Reception Freud and Philosophy has become a well-known study of Freud, influential in both philosophy and psychoanalysis. Together with Fallible Man and The Symbolism of Evil, both published in 1960, and The Conflict of Interpretations (1969), it is considered one of Ricœur's most important works. Commentators have evaluated it from a variety of philosophical perspectives, offering a mixture of praise and criticism for the work. Freud and Philosophy has been compared to Eros and Civilization, as well as to Freud: The Mind of the Moralist, and the philosopher Jürgen Habermas's Knowledge and Human Interests (1968) and the classicist Norman O. Brown's Life Against Death (1959). The philosopher Jeffrey Abramson, who praised Ricœur's discussions of narcissism and sublimation, maintained that these works jointly placed Freud at the center of moral and philosophical inquiry. Freud and Philosophy has also been praised by the philosophers Don Ihde, who nevertheless found its approach to interpretation limited by its focus on the ideas of symbol and double meaning, Richard Kearney, and Douglas Kellner. Kearney credited Ricœur with demonstrating that the symbolic imagination is linguistic; he has also suggested that Ricœur was engaged in a form of eschatology. Kellner credited Ricœur with demonstrating the importance of psychoanalysis for \\"increasing understanding of human nature and contributing to the process of self- formation\\". He believed Ricœur made better use of some Freudian ideas than did Marcuse. The psychoanalysts R. D. Chessick, Joel Kovel, and Joel Whitebook, have praised Freud and Philosophy. Chessick called the book a \\"classic\\" and \\"one of the best philosophical works on Freud\\", crediting Ricœur with providing a \\"thorough and scholarly\\" discussion of Freud, and with presenting \\"brilliant ideas and conceptions\\". He praised Ricœur's treatment of Freud's view of religion. He compared the structure of Freud and Philosophy to that of the philosopher Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781), and found its \\"methodology and prose\\" reminiscent of Hegel. However, he described the work as poorly written and sometimes unintelligible. He also faulted Ricœur for over-emphasizing symbols and for his treatment of the transference and the relationship of psychoanalysis to science. He suggested that Ricœur borrowed from Lacan, finding this apparent in Ricœur's understanding of the \\"semantics of desire\\". Kovel described Freud and Philosophy as an important demonstration that Freud was a post-Hegelian thinker. Whitebook argued that Freud and Philosophy was \\"unsurpassed\\" and disproved the view that clinical experience is necessary for understanding psychoanalytic theory. The psychologists Paul Vitz and Malcolm Macmillan have both praised Ricœur's discussion of Freud's theories about the development of the ego. Macmillan credited Ricœur with recognizing that Freud saw a close connection between the mental structures he outlined in The Ego and the Id and the instinctual theory he put forward in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. He endorsed Ricœur's criticism of the concept of sublimation and his questioning of the idea that identification has an oral origin. Ricœur's hermeneutic approach to psychoanalysis has been discussed by the historians Peter Gay and Roger Smith. Gay described Freud and Philosophy as a \\"highly disciplined study\\", but noted his disagreement with the work. Smith credited Ricœur with demonstrating the merits of a hermeneutic approach to Freud. The pastoral counselor Kirk A. Bingaman praised Ricœur's discussion of hermeneutics, crediting him with demonstrating that \\"a Freudian hermeneutic\\" can both challenge and \\"purify and strengthen\\" religious faith. However, Freud and Philosophy has received criticism from psychologists such as Hans Eysenck, Glenn Wilson, and Paul Kline, who have attributed to Ricœur the view that psychoanalysis either cannot or should not be evaluated in terms of experimental evidence. Eysenck and Wilson described Freud and Philosophy as a good example of a defense of psychoanalysis against the claim that it should be so evaluated. They argued that Ricœur espoused a form of \\"extreme subjectivism\\" which implies that psychoanalytic theories cannot be tested empirically or shown to be mistaken. They suggested that Freud would have rejected Ricœur's conclusions and that few psychologists or psychoanalysts would accept them. They also argued that if Ricœur's conclusions were to be accepted, this would further undermine psychoanalysis. Kline wrote that Ricœur might be correct that psychoanalysis cannot be dealt with through experiments based on quantifiable evidence, but argued that if he is, this shows that psychoanalytic theory is not scientific. The sociologist John Thompson considered Ricœur's views about the role of language and meaning in psychoanalysis similar to those of Lacan. While Thompson praised Freud and Philosophy, he believed that Ricœur failed to resolve the \\"question of the scientific status of psychoanalysis\\" in the work. He and Ricœur both noted that Ricœur took a different approach to the issue in his essay \\"The question of proof in Freud's psychoanalytic writings\\", which was published in Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences (1981). The philosopher Richard J. Bernstein credited Ricœur with showing that there was always a tension in Freud's thinking between an emphasis on \\"energetics\\" and an emphasis on \\"hermeneutics\\", and with using his discussion of Hegel to explain aspects of Freud's work. However, he noted that Ricœur presented only one possible philosophical interpretation of Freud, and suggested that the section of Freud and Philosophy in which he did so was the weakest part of the book. He argued that Ricœur's interpretation of Freud suffered from \\"tensions and unresolved issues\\". He also remained unconvinced by Ricœur's critique of Freud's views on religion. Ricœur has also been criticized by the philosophers Ronald de Sousa, Geoff Waite, and Todd Dufresne. De Sousa maintained that Ricœur was one of several commentators on Freud to have incorrectly argued that Freud, by basing the method of psychoanalysis on an extension of the principle of determinism from the physical to the mental realm, confused determinism and meaningfulness. Waite described Ricœur's claim that Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche form a \\"school of suspicion\\" as \\"famous\\" but misleading. Dufresne considered Ricœur's interpretation of Freud evenhanded and in some ways superior to Lacan's. He credited Ricœur with discussing important points that are rarely addressed, and complimented his interpretation of the concept of the death drive. However, he concluded that Ricœur's attempt to \\"oppose and then synthesize\\" Freud and Hegel was already dated when Freud and Philosophy was published. He noted that thinkers such Marcuse, Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler have produced interpretations of Beyond the Pleasure Principle irreconcilable with Ricœur's. The philosopher Adolf Grünbaum has discussed Freud and Philosophy in works such as The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) and Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis (1993). In The Foundations of Psychoanalysis, he criticized Ricœur's hermeneutic interpretation of Freud, arguing that Ricœur incorrectly limited the relevance of psychoanalytic theory to verbal statements made during analytic therapy. He accused Ricœur of wanting to protect his hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis from scientific examination and criticism, and maintained that Ricœur's arguments rested on an untenable dichotomy between theory and observation and that he took a reductive form of behaviorism as his model of scientific psychology. He argued that Ricœur's view that psychoanalysis provides a \\"semantics of desire\\" mistakenly equates symptoms with linguistic representations of their causes, and accused Ricœur of endorsing Lacan's \\"obfuscating\\" view that a symptom resembles \\"a language whose speech must be realized\\". However, Grünbaum gave Ricœur credit for later, in Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences, reassessing his views by abandoning the dichotomy between reasons and causes. Grünbaum's criticisms of Ricœur have been endorsed, in whole or in part, by the psychologist Robert R. Holt, the psychoanalyst Jonathan Lear, the historian Paul Robinson, and the critic Frederick Crews. Holt dismissed Freud and Philosophy, arguing that it was only superficially impressive, that parts of it were unreadable, and that Ricœur used vague or inappropriately metaphorical language. He also maintained that Ricœur's view that psychoanalysis is not a science depended on unoriginal arguments. Though he noted that Ricœur's views were supported by some psychoanalysts, he argued that if Ricœur's view that psychoanalysis does not have to make predictions and is not subject to \\"substantial constraints\\" were correct, it would mean the end of psychoanalysis. Lear criticized Freud and Philosophy, blaming it, along with Knowledge and Human Interests, for convincing some psychoanalysts that reasons cannot be causes. Robinson described Freud and Philosophy as a classic portrayal of Freud as a hermeneutician and a philosopher similar to Nietzsche. He compared Ricœur's views to those of Derrida. Although he believed that there was some truth to them, he argued that Ricœur's arguments obscured Freud's identification with the scientific tradition. He credited Grünbaum with showing that Ricœur was misguided in this respect. Crews criticized Ricœur for helping to inspire unscientific defenses of Freud and psychoanalysis and for misunderstanding Freud. The philosopher Philippe Lacour suggested that the debate between Grünbaum and Ricœur suffered from the fact that, while Grünbaum read and responded to Ricœur's writings, it was unclear whether Ricœur paid any attention to Grünbaum. According to the historian and psychoanalyst Élisabeth Roudinesco, Ricœur first presented the interpretation of Freud later expounded in Freud and Philosophy at a colloquium held in France in 1960. Roudinesco maintains that Freud and Philosophy combines hermeneutics with a philosophy inspired by \\"post-Hegelian phenomenology\\", draws on Christian traditions and language, and conflicted with the structuralism of the early 1960s. According to Roudinesco, Freud and Philosophy was well received in France because it was the first book of its kind, but also criticized because phenomenology had become unfashionable by the time it was published in May 1965. Freud and Philosophy angered Lacan, who had expected the book to praise him. It has been suggested that Lacan was angered by Freud and Philosophy because he considered himself alone to be the \\"authentic French interpreter of Freud\\". Lacan spread the rumor, which convinced Lacan's followers, that Ricœur had borrowed his ideas without attribution. Some psychoanalysts influenced by Lacan argued that since Ricœur was not a psychoanalyst and had never been psychoanalyzed he was incompetent to write about Freud. In Critique, the psychoanalyst Jean-Paul Valabrega accused Ricœur of having drawn on Lacan's ideas despite claiming to be original. At the request of the philosopher Michel Foucault, Critique published a reply by Ricœur, in which he denied the accusation and explained that he had completed the outline of his interpretation of Freud before having read Lacan. Roudinesco dismisses the charge that Ricœur had borrowed Lacan's ideas, arguing that he could not have done so given his failure to understand them. Roudinesco states that Freud and Philosophy received a negative review in Les Temps modernes from Michel Tort, who argued that the book was obscurantist and reactionary, that Ricœur's Christian and phenomenological approach to understanding Freud's texts was unhelpful and obsolete, and that Lacan's approach to psychoanalysis was superior to that of Ricœur. Vinicio Busacchi wrote that Tort's discussion of Freud and Philosophy was \\"fallacious and calumnious\\" and that the accusation of plagiarism against Ricœur was false. Others who responded to the book in France include the philosopher Louis Althusser's students, whose view of the work was negative, as well as Deleuze and Guattari; Ricœur's arguments about the death instinct influenced their joint work Anti-Oedipus (1972). However, they were critical of Ricœur's interpretation of Freud's theory of culture. After Ricœur's death in 2005, the philosopher Jonathan Rée wrote that Freud and Philosophy was a \\"powerful\\" book that had been \\"scandalously neglected in France\\". Freud and Philosophy received positive reviews in academic journals written in English. These reviews include those by the psychiatrist Peter H. Knapp in The American Journal of Psychiatry, the psychoanalyst Gerald J. Gargiulo in The Psychoanalytic Review, the philosopher Eliseo Vivas in the Journal of Value Inquiry, the philosopher John W. Slaughter in the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion, the psychiatrist Simon A. Grolnick in The Psychoanalytic Quarterly, the psychiatrist Norman Reider in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, Ihde in the International Philosophical Quarterly, the psychiatrist Eliot Slater in the British Journal of Psychiatry, the philosopher George J. Stack in The Modern Schoolman, and the theologian Walter James Lowe in Religious Studies Review. However, the book received a negative review from the philosopher John M. Hems in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. Knapp described the book as \\"thoughtful, searching, and comprehensive\\". He wrote that Ricœur had broad knowledge of both philosophy and psychoanalysis. He credited him with carefully distinguishing between different aspects of Freud's work and convincingly criticizing Freud's hypotheses about language and views about religion. He also believed that he revealed Freud's \\"lack of a broad view of symbolic functioning\\", exposed confusions in Freud's thought, such as that between \\"force\\" as a metaphorical term and \\"force\\" as a reference to observable phenomena, and showed that psychoanalysis resembles historical science and phenomenology rather than science as understood by positivism. He praised his discussion of Toulmin. However, he suggested that integrating Freud's views about meaning with Freud's ideas about \\"drive energy\\" would \\"require a more comprehensive psychosomatic theory of emotion\\" than that provided by Ricœur, and that Freud and Philosophy was sometimes confused and presented debatable conclusions. He compared the book to Brown's Life Against Death. Gargiulo described the book as \\"a provocative philosophical enterprise and a masterful reading of Freud\\" and \\"a text of extraordinary complexity and sensitivity\\". He compared Ricœur's work to that of Rieff, and credited him with showing that \\"desire has a semantics\\" and that psychoanalysis \\"cannot be verified as in physical and experimental sciences\\". He praised his discussions of sublimation and symbols. However, he criticized Ricœur's discussion of the reality principle. Vivas described the book as the most thorough study of Freudian theory that he was aware of. He considered it similar, but also superior to, Freud: The Mind of the Moralist. He praised Ricœur's discussion of Freud's views on religion, crediting him with convincingly criticizing and correcting them. However, while finding Ricœur's views on religion preferable to Freud's, he nevertheless disagreed with them. He also expressed uncertainty about whether Ricœur had resolved the issue of the scientific status of psychoanalysis, and questioned the value of Ricœur's discussion of the reasons for the difficulty of resolving whether the processes postulated by psychoanalysis actually exist. Slaughter suggested that the book might be the best commentary on Freud ever written, maintaining that it not only assisted in the understanding of Freud but had implications for the practice of philosophy. However, he criticized Ricœur's discussion of Freud's views on religion, believing that Ricœur interrupted his discussion of Freud by presenting his personal beliefs. Grolnick understood the work as \\"a stage in the development of a comprehensive religious philosophy\\". He credited Ricœur with placing psychoanalysis in a larger historical and intellectual context and relating it to contemporary cultural trends, showing broad knowledge of philosophy, literature, and religion, and providing a useful discussion of the development of Freud's work. He praised Ricœur's exploration of topics such as narcissism, identification, sublimation, and the reality principle, and believed that he showed the flaws of some of Freud's views on art, culture, and religion. He complimented Ricœur for his comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology. However, he wrote that psychoanalysts might disagree with Ricœur's assessment of the scientific status of psychoanalysis, and that some of Ricœur's criticisms of Freud were unoriginal, having been made within psychoanalysis itself. Reider described the work as \\"one of the most important books on the theory of psychoanalysis in the last two decades\\". He praised Ricœur's discussion of Freud, crediting him with noting respects in which Freud's views were illogical, inconsistent, or incomplete, especially where religion was concerned. He considered Ricœur's critique of Freud superior to anything written by psychoanalysts. He also praised Ricœur's discussion of \\"symbols and symbolization\\" and his criticism of Nagel. However, he wrote that Ricœur's \\"preoccupation with religion, with the sacred, and his conclusion that psychoanalyis is teleological contain weighty evidence of his acceptance of idealism\\". Ihde maintained that the book was primarily about language and hermeneutics and that Ricœur's discussion of Freud was often \\"tedious\\". He credited Ricœur with using the Freudian ideas to correct phenomenology. He noted that the book was \\"Ricœur's most controversial work\\", and that it was criticized by adherents of phenomenology, who argued that Ricœur ignored the contributions of \\"phenomenological-existentialist psychologists\\". He rejected such criticisms. He also argued that despite the charge that Ricœur had borrowed ideas from Lacan, Freud and Philosophy reflected themes, such as the importance of symbols, that Ricœur had explored in earlier works such as The Symbolism of Evil. Slater considered the book impressive, calling it the first detailed study \\"by a professional philosopher of the development of Freud's thought and of psychoanalytical theory in all the stages of its growth\\". He praised Ricœur's discussion of the development of Freud's ideas. However, he found it unclear whether Ricœur \\"shows successfully on what grounds psychoanalysis could subjected to any criticism whatsoever\\". He suggested that Ricœur's view of the interactions between psychoanalysts and their patients misleadingly suggested that there is no way for third parties to determine the truth or untruth of the claims made by the analysts about their patients. He believed that this undermined their credibility. Stack described the book as \\"illuminating and profound\\". He credited Ricœur with providing \\"the most complete philosophical interpretation\\" of psychoanalysis to date, demonstrating \\"the incompleteness of Freud's conception of symbols\\", carefully discussing Freud's view of instinct, convincingly criticizing Freud's theorizing about the death instinct, and usefully comparing \\"Hegel's phenomenology of desire and Freudian theory\\". He praised Ricœur's comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology, suggesting that he showed that they are ultimately incompatible despite the similarities between them. While he believed that Ricœur's insights undermined Freud's hostility to religion, he questioned Ricœur's attempt to find common ground between Freud and the phenomenology of religion. He was also unconvinced by Ricœur's attempt to demonstrate \\"an implicit teleology in psychoanalysis\\". In Religious Studies Review, Lowe credited Ricœur with providing an interesting perspective on psychoanalysis. He compared Ricœur's views to those of Browning. He praised his comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology, crediting him with showing why it is wrong to absorb psychoanalysis into phenomenology or identify the two. He also praised his discussion of Freud's ideas in relation to those of Hegel. He wrote that he had influenced discussions of the relevance of Freud to theology, for example in his description of a teleological aspect to Freudian thought. However, he suggested that Freud and Philosophy contained unusual language. Hems wrote that the book could be seen as either \\"a work of formidable thoroughness\\" or one of \\"irksome prolixity\\", depending on one's point of view. He questioned whether Ricœur's attempt to reinterpret Freud was successful.

Their debut album, Monoculture, was released on Tooth & Nail Records in the summer of 2011 and was produced by Mike Sapone. The band released their second album, Headswell, in October 2013 through No Sleep Records.  History  = Origins (2009-2010) = The band was co-founded by lead vocalist/guitarist Francesco Montesanto and Brand New touring guitarist Derrick Sherman, who had grown up together in Long Island, developing similar musical tastes and periodically playing music together when not touring with other bands they were in. The beginnings of Sainthood Reps came when Montesanto sent Sherman a collection of demos he had written, ultimately leading to a musical collaboration. They first released music under the Sainthood Reps name via a Myspace page in August 2009. Drummer Bradley Cordaro and bassist Jani Zubkovs joined, and the band officially formed in September 2009. They first started touring in December of the same year with All the Day Holiday, followed by a January 2010 tour with Caspian. Also in January, the band released a split EP with O'Brother. = Signing and Monoculture (2010-2011) = Originally intending to record a double EP in March 2010, the band was distracted from that venture by a number of offers from record labels. One of these was from Tooth & Nail Records, who had heard their split EP and ultimately signed them in February 2011. Prior to their signing, Sainthood Reps spent May 2010 touring with The Felix Culpa and played a September show with fellow Long Island bands The Sleeping and Glassjaw. Monoculture was released by Tooth & Nail on August 9, 2011, to largely positive reviews. In the latter half of 2011, the band opened for The Felix Culpa at the latter's farewell show. =Touring and planned future releases (2011-2012)= Sherman confirmed to Indie Vision Music in an October 2011 video interview that he and Montesanto had written \\"five songs that we know are on record two\\", as well as an EP that they were \\"debating about putting out\\" which would showcase the band's original post-rock instrumental style. In the spring of 2012, Sainthood Reps joined La Dispute's Wildlife Tour and released a music video for \\"Monoculture\\", the title track from their debut album. =Headswell (2012-present)= The band released their second full length, Headswell on October 22, 2013 via No Sleep Records.  Musical style and influences  Andrew Leahey of AllMusic describes the band's music as \\"a moody mix of post-grunge, hard rock, and post-hardcore\\", while Brian, a staff writer at Punknews.org, said of the band's split EP, \\"Like O'Brother, the band mixes indie rock brood and post-rock atmosphere, but with a little more obvious melody and verse-chorus structure.\\" Montesanto himself has described Sainthood Reps' music as simply \\"loud\\" and \\"early '90s alternative\\". Influences cited by the band include Fugazi, Nirvana, Mogwai, The Cohen Brothers, The Jesus Lizard, Built to Spill, Dinosaur Jr., Sunny Day Real Estate, Explosions in the Sky, Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, and Yuck.

In the first, you saw 120 fluorescent chairs facing a blank wall. On the back of each chair a copy of the project's catalogue had been nailed and officially signed by a Professor from Karolinska Institutet and approved for publication, following local academic protocol. Each chair was an authorized copy of Jonas Bohlin's Concrete from 1980 that had been customized by the design group Åbäke. The two flanking side rooms remained empty apart from a solitary lectern painted in the same color as the chairs and which was connected to speakers that emitted music and sounds composed for the occasion by participating sound artists Andy Cox and Richard Allalouf, Natalia Kamia, Samon Takahashi, Ebbot Lundberg and Yan Jun who interpreted a text written by Hüttner and Arnér on the importance and difficulty of dialogues between art and science. A new sound piece was played back each week. Lundberg's contribution, There's Only One of Us Here was released in 2012 – his first solo album in a 25-year career. At 2pm, every Sunday in March 2011, a dialogue took place. The dialogues were devised so that a member of the scientific community dialogued with a member of the world of visual art.

Atlanta is the center of the film industry in Georgia with Turner, Tyler Perry, and EUE/Screen Gems studios located there. The industry in Georgia was boosted substantially by tax incentives introduced in 2002 and strengthened in 2008. Just in the fiscal year 2017 film and TV production had an economic impact in Georgia of $9.5 billion, while industry sources claim that the tax subsidy costs the state $141 million (2010). Films shot in Georgia include Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns (2008), Life as We Know It (2010), Contagion (2011) and a number of Marvel Studios productions, including Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, as well as Ant Man and the Wasp and Black Panther. Atlanta has since been called the \\"Hollywood of the South\\". Ranking Georgia overtook California in 2016 as the state location with the most feature films produced overall. Incentives The state's first tax incentive, a point of purchase sales and use tax exemption, was introduced in 2002. The state's second and most progressive tax incentive, the Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act, was signed into law in May 2005 and updated in May 2008. The act granted qualified productions a transferable income tax credit of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 or more. An additional 10% tax credit was awarded to approved projects that embed a Georgia Entertainment Promotional logo within the titles or credits of each production. This vanity card, usually seen in closing credits, is rendered as an image of the Georgia Department of Economic Development's peach logo, a link to the GDEC's filming-specific tourism website, and a male voice saying or a woman singing \\"Made in Georgia\\".Georgia Department of Economic Development In 2005 Georgia spent $10.3 million on its film incentive. That amount increased to $140.6 million by 2010. By the fiscal year 2015, the amount spent by Georgia in issued tax credits for the year was just over $504 million. Impact on economy The Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office states that more than 700 feature films, TV movies, TV series, single episodes, and pilots have been produced in Georgia since 1972. In fiscal year 2017 film and TV production had an economic impact in Georgia of $9.5 billion. According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development: * There are more than 5,000 individual technicians and other workers in Georgia * The average number of local employees on a medium budget feature film is about 150-175 * On a larger budget production, there are about 200-250 local employees * The average feature film budget is 41.7 million dollars * The average amount (below-the-line) of feature film budget spent in a state is 60% - 70%, higher for locally produced projects. Facilities Atlanta has become a center for film and television production and counts the presence of Turner Studios, which produces content for the Turner Broadcasting family of stations; since 2008 the Tyler Perry Studios in Southwest Atlanta; and since 2010 the EUE/Screen Gems soundstages in Lakewood Heights, south Atlanta, and to a limited extent, the facilities of Georgia Public Broadcasting, where the first season of Swift Justice with Nancy Grace was taped using state tax credits. Both films and many popular TV shows such as The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Tyler Perry's series, and Family Feud (from 2011 to 2017) are produced in Atlanta, while Floyd County Productions's FXX animated series Archer and several Adult Swim animated series are also produced under GEDC tax credits. In 2014, Pinewood Studios opened a large studio in Fayette County, Georgia. Films such as Ant Man and Captain America: Civil War have been shot at the studio. Productions in Georgia There were 348 productions shot in the state in 2009. These industry establishments are probably supported wholly or in part by the production of feature films; television movies, series, pilots and miniseries; commercials, music videos, documentaries and still shoots. =Films shot in Metro Atlanta= Films shot in Atlanta include Little Darlings (1980), Sharky's Machine (1981), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Outbreak (1995), Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns (2008), Life as We Know It (2010), and Contagion (2011). Covington in Metro Atlanta has been home to dozens of feature and television projects that include the hit TV series The Vampire Diaries and In the Heat of the Night. Although many types of films are shot in Atlanta, the New York Times in 2011 recognized the particular concentration of horror and zombie-themed productions in the city.Robbie Brown, \\"Zombie Apocalypse?

Later that year, she toured in Three Twins, as Summer Girl and Boo Hoo Tee Hee Girl. In 1911 she was Desirée in the musical The Pink Lady at the New Amsterdam Theatre, after which she went on tour with the show. She was next in Florenz Ziegfeld's A Winsome Widow (1912), at the Moulin Rouge, in New York, playing the role of Tony.

It was written in 1979 but was not published until 1990, after the Berlin Wall fell.  Summary  It is the story of a day in the life of an East German woman whose apartment and occupational activity are openly watched by the Stasi. The story raises the subject of surveillance, particularly the feeling of paranoia, self-doubt, and the disturbances it causes in everyday life; symptoms of fear and nervousness, such as unrest, sleeplessness, weight-loss, and hair-loss. No conversation can be held within her apartment without the telephone jack being pulled to prevent calls from having unwanted listeners. Telephone calls are a façade, where only code words and petty banter take place. As a first-person narrative, the reader is transported into the author's inner monologue and introspection. By the end of the story she is very much influenced by her listeners, who are school children; they retain an optimism that although today is a bad day or a dark one, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow will be brighter or blissful.

It includes the original community of Redstone as built by Colorado Fuel and Iron (CFI) for the coal miners it employed. In 1989 it was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Redstone was originally a company town. John Cleveland Osgood, CFI's president at the time, spent lavishly to create quality housing for miners and their families, as well as various other public buildings, in an effort to forestall unionization. Architect Theodore Boal designed simple yet attractive structures by adapting various Victorian architectural styles. The district includes as contributing properties Osgood's estate, Cleveholm, and the Redstone Inn. At first very populous and successful due to the high production capacity of the nearby coke ovens, Redstone was almost abandoned within a decade when it became too costly to transport coke from the remote community to CFI's new steel mill. A handful of residents remained, keeping Redstone from becoming another one of Colorado's many ghost towns. Some of its original buildings were demolished over the years. Eventually the town rebounded slightly and today is home to a small arts community; many of the remaining buildings have been restored. It is one of the few intact company towns remaining in the state. Geography The district is formed by the original townsite for Redstone, using original surveyed lot boundaries on the north, south and east. It is a strip of land running north-south along the Crystal River for a mile and a half (). Redstone Boulevard (also County Route 3), lined with some of its original Llewellyn Westinghouse cast iron streetlamps, is the backbone of the district. On the west its boundary follows either State Highway 133 or the east bank of the for roughly one mile from 242 Redstone, and the parallel point on Hill Road, in the north, the limit of the historic portion of town, to where Hawk Creek flows into the Crystal south of Osgood Castle. The within those boundaries make it the largest of the four historic districts in the county. It includes 32 buildings, three structures and one object. Most of the buildings are small wood frame cottages; the larger buildings are primarily located along the mountain slopes. Two of the larger buildings, the castle and the Redstone Inn, are themselves listed on the Register. A bridge leads across the river to Highway 133, the only road to Redstone. Just across it is the smaller Redstone Coke Oven Historic District, the remains of the coking facilities that employed many Redstone residents during the peak of its prosperity. On either side of Redstone, mountains rise to summits over . Their slopes are mostly undeveloped and part of White River National Forest. The eastern slopes are additionally part of the Maroon Bells–Snowmass Wilderness that separates Redstone from the county seat, Aspen, due east. History The history of Redstone parallels the history of the industrialization of the West. After a long prehistory of exploration and colonization, the town's remote resources were exploited and made accessible for a brief period of prosperity. Once the mining stopped, the town faded almost as quickly as it grew. It has avoided becoming a ghost town by embracing tourism. =1700s–1860: European settlement of the Crystal River Valley= Traders and trappers working for the Astor family in the 1830s were the first Europeans to visit the region. John C. Frémont led two American expeditions during the 1840s. Later came prospectors looking unsuccessfully for gold.Simmons, R. Laurie and Whitacre, Christine; , History Colorado, March 1989, pp. 3–5. Retrieved January 16, 2012. Treaties with the Utes, the Native American tribe that had long claimed the Crystal Valley and other lands in today's Pitkin County as home, made it more amenable to settlement after the Civil War. The state and federal governments hoped that mineral resources in the region might developed that way, but did not know what those resources might be. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden's 1873 survey provided some answers, in the form of rich coal deposits in the mountains. He also gave many of the mountains and streams their names. =1880–1900: Early mine development= In the portions of the upper Crystal Valley located in what is today Gunnison County, settlement, Crystal and Schofield, now ghost towns, sprung up around early silver and lead strikes. By 1880 the Ute had been forced to cede their land and leave the area for reservations. With this last impediment to potential riches removed, prospectors and other fortune seekers were everywhere in the valley. alt=A black-and-white photograph of a balding man with his head bowed smoking a cigar, from the side Among them was John C. Osgood, doing a survey of the state's coal resources for the coal company he worked for and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CBQRR), one of its major customers. The coal in the Crystal valley was plentiful and of high enough quality that he started his own company, Colorado Fuel. His main customer was a CBQRR subsidiary, the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad. As he sold to them he bought land, hoping to exploit one day deposits of coal that would make high-quality coke. To realize these plans, it would be necessary to build transportation infrastructure. The company took the legal steps necessary to build both a toll road and railroad. Apart from some surveying, nothing else was accomplished. A line that might have connected to the valley, the Aspen and Western Railway, was built to coalfields at Willow Park near Carbondale in 1888 by Colorado Fuel's main rival at the time. It was abandoned as quickly as it had been built when the coal proved inferior. The two companies merged in 1892 and became Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I;). It soon became the largest coal mining company in the entire West, responsible for two-thirds of Colorado's output. The profits from these endeavors at last gave Osgood the capital he needed to fully exploit the Crystal valley. Due to bank failures around Colorado and other aftereffects of the Panic of 1893, it took the rest of the 1890s before financing was in place and actual construction could start. Another delay, caused by a United Mine Workers of America strike, left Osgood bitterly opposed to unions. From the railroad line, a narrow gauge spur would parallel Coal Creek, climbing up and to an area where the coal was pure, with almost no ash, thus ideal for coking. At that site the town of Coalbasin was built. Where it reached the main line in the valley, at the coke ovens, the coal and coke would be taken to Carbondale and points elsewhere by the Denver and Rio Grande Western and Colorado Midland. The town around that junction was named Redstone, for the high cliffs of orange sandstone in the mountains above. alt=Round stone structures with large openings on the left built into a grassy hillside behind a wooden fence. There is a snow-capped mountain in the rear. =1900–1903: Company town= Almost 250 ovens were built by workers from Denver to handle the Coalbasin coal, making it the largest such facility in the state. The workers there, 10% of all the workers in the state at that time, were predominantly immigrants from Eastern Europe whom the company had recruited from the East. The miners, by contrast, were usually longtime Colorado residents who had worked in mines elsewhere. Mining towns in 19th-century Colorado had often been built by the miners themselves out of whatever material they could find and assemble in their spare time. Often these wound up being log cabins covered with rock and dirt. The companies had to provide other public services due to the remoteness of many camps, but did nothing to provide living quarters. In the labor unrest of the era, the shabby and unsafe housing, which miners often shared with their families, were a frequent source of complaint.Simmons and Whitacre, 9–16. Osgood, who had built his estate nearby, thought it was time to change that. The miners would be happier if they lived in decent accommodations, and happier miners would be more productive and less likely to strike. Inspired by the company towns built in New England, and more recently Pullman, Illinois, established by that company for its workers, he decided that Redstone would be a model for other CFI towns. He had personally acquired much land in the valley, and spent nearly $5 million ($ in modern dollars) to build it. After adding running water and building homes at El Moro, a camp near Trinidad, CFI concluded it was possible to do the same on a larger scale with Redstone. At the time the miners' shacks were clustered around the coke ovens on the western side of the river. Osgood decided the company town would be on the other side, away from an improvised, unplanned development that represented the way mining communities had been to that point. There, he hoped, the workers would live \\"free of strife and want.\\" CFI established a Sociological Department to oversee education, social and industrial training, housing and communications. alt=A street lined with streetlights and houses on large lots sheltered by trees, leading towards tall mountain slopes in the distance Plan A planned townsite was laid out. There would be two streets, River Road (now Redstone Boulevard), the main street, and Hill Road, a side street slightly uphill from it to the east. In between there were occasional alleys and back streets with switchbacks. River Road ran all the way south to Osgood's estate. A railroad spur crossed the Crystal to run between River Road and the river, for passenger traffic and freight shipments to the town, allowing the main line to be used exclusively for coal and coke loading and unloading at the ovens. The commercial center of Redstone would be at the rail depot, just opposite the coke ovens; the rest of the town would be residential. Theodore Boal, who had designed Osgood Castle, was commissioned to supervise the design of Redstone's buildings. He adapted many popular Victorian styles to the mountain setting. In particular, he was enamored of the Swiss chalet style, popularized a half-century earlier by the influential Eastern architect and critic Andrew Jackson Downing in his pattern book The Architecture of Country Houses. On that basic form, he chose decorative elements from the Shingle, Dutch Colonial Revival and Tudorbethan styles. The first group of one-story frame cottages, meant for the coke oven workers, was finished in 1901. Structurally they were an improvement over the improvised shacks they were intended to replace. Instead of the board-and-batten siding common in other late 19th-century Colorado mining towns, they had clapboard or shiplap, painted in pleasant, \\"restful\\" pastel colors. Half-timber was a common decorative feature. Windows were generally two-over-two double-hung sash. At the rooflines were wide overhanging eaves meant to provide shelter from bad weather, decorated with wavy vergeboards and shaped wooden brackets. Their main blocks' hipped roofs, considered more picturesque by Downing, were pierced by gabled dormers and center chimneys. They were complemented by gabled or shed roofs on the porches. Many had outbuildings, some even themselves with decoration. Inside, the houses had three to five rooms. Amenities included electricity, provided at 35 cents ($) a month in modern dollars a month from a hydroelectric plant the company built on the Crystal, and running water, luxuries unknown to worker housing in previous mining towns. Larger buildings included the Tudor Revival Redstone Inn, originally a 40-room dormitory for the unmarried employees, at the south end of the center of town. In addition to electricity and running water, it had telephones, a barbershop, laundry and reading room. The company store at the north end was a timber frame building closer in style to the cottages. Behind it were a fenced park and Lake Gibb, which froze over and allowed for ice skating in the winter. On Hill Road near the store were the Tudor Revival school, with a stone entrance tower. The company paid for the teachers and textbooks. The school had one of the earliest kindergartens in Colorado. In addition to educating the children of the miners, the school also did what is today called adult education. English classes were offered to students' parents, particularly those employed at the ovens, so they could work more efficiently. Workers' wives attended classes in \\"domestic science\\", what is known today as home economics. Nearby was the two-and-a-half-story wood-frame Redstone Club, recreational facilities for the workers. It included a billiard and pool room, reading room, and bar. At the latter facility, treating others to drinks was prohibited, a policy that CFI had implemented in Coalbasin and found effective in limiting the impact of alcohol consumption on the quality of life. Upstairs was a theater; the basement held showers, baths and dressing rooms. The club was complemented by the Big Horn Lodge across the river, meant for company meetings, banquets and entertaining guests from out of town. Its amenities included a bowling alley in the basement. It was less preferable for this purpose since the air around it was often polluted by smoke from the coke ovens. Nearby was the town cemetery and public gardens. Each family was offered a plot where, it was hoped, they could grow fresh vegetables, and perhaps raise a cow as well for milk. The company built a barn to house workers' livestock. Near the power plant was the firehouse. It was a two-story frame building with half-timbers, wood shingles and diamond-paned windows. Inside was one hand-drawn pumper. Construction continued throughout 1902, as the ovens went full blast. Redstone attracted national attention. At that year's St. Louis Exposition, it received an award. The New York Times wrote about \\"The Ruby of the Rockies\\", as the community came to be nicknamed, calling it \\"a town to rave over ... the most beautiful town in Colorado.\\" By 1903 83 cottages had been completed. South of the center of town a second group was started. These were intended for miners, middle managers and white- collar workers. They were located between two of the larger houses meant for senior managers. Architecturally they were similar to the workers' cottages in the center of town, but they were located on larger lots on the hillside with greater setbacks from the road, giving them a view over the valley. Mature trees were left standing, making the neighborhood seem carefully landscaped Just north of Osgood's estate, at the south end of River Road, were the houses of senior managers. They were the largest (save the castle), with more sweeping views and more elaborate ornamentation. A map from the time identifies one on the hillside above Hill Road as the superintendent's house. While they lived at the estate, Osgood and his wife, Alma, were a frequent presence among the workers. The two regularly attended public ceremonies and celebrations. Osgood personally checked on how miners were doing and donated supplies when needed. Alma, known as Lady Bountiful by the workers, entertained visitors at the estate and made sure that all the latest fashions were available at the store. During construction, Boal was frequently about town reporting to Osgood. =1904–present: Decline and preservation= As construction was completed, CFI was encountering financial difficulties due to strikes at its facilities elsewhere in the state and its heavy investment in its Pueblo plant. To resolve them, Osgood was forced to surrender control of the company to interests controlled by the Gould and Rockefeller families. He remained active in the state, starting the Victor American Fuel Company, which became CFI's major competitor. But he began spending more time back in New York and less in Redstone, making him less able to guide the town's progress. The new managers cared less about the community than he had.Simmons and Whitacre, 18. In 1908, CFI decided to consolidate all coke production at Pueblo as it was too expensive to maintain the Redstone facility. The ovens were shut down that year; the mines at Coalbasin the next. Families left their possessions behind in a hurry to catch the last train out. Redstone dwindled to a small caretaker population of less than a dozen. Osgood eventually closed down his estate in 1913. He continued to be involved in the Colorado mining industry, and was questioned by both state and federal investigators in the wake of the Ludlow Massacre the following year, in which workers at CFI mines in the south central region of the state revolted against the paternalist approach the company took, where it had provided schools, libraries and churches for miners yet continued to engage in exploitative labor practices in the mines. In the aftermath John D. Rockefeller felt that Osgood's recalcitrance and apparent insensitivity to the miners' concerns there vindicated his belief that poor character led to social conflict. In 1924 Osgood returned to Redstone. He and his third wife, Lucille, took up residence in the castle once again and began redeveloping it as a resort. Ill with cancer, he died the following year and his ashes were scattered over the valley. Lucille inherited the estate, and finished the redevelopment, only to have the hotel fail quickly as the Great Depression ruined the tourist trade. Just 14 people lived in Redstone by 1941. During the war, many of its larger buildings, such as the school, clubhouse and Big Horn Lodge, were demolished and sold for salvage. The community's decline stopped the following year, when another company resumed coal mining operations in the Coalbasin area. But the loss of the original buildings continued, as many of the cottages were either demolished as a result of the neglect after so many winters at above sea level in the mountains, or moved. After the resurgence of Aspen as a resort in the late 20th century, Redstone began to gain residents and attract tourists who valued its historic buildings. The Redstone Inn was eventually restored and reopened in its present use, and the castle was opened for tours. Some of the remaining cottages have become bed and breakfasts; the town is also home to a small informal art colony.Simmons and Whitacre, 19. alt=An elaborate stone and wood building with many peaked roofs and chimneys with a wooded hill behind it. Significant contributing properties Many of the original cottages and most of the larger buildings from Redstone's peak years have been demolished, but some noteworthy structures remain from the era. Two have been listed on the National Register themselves. *General Store, 292 Redstone Boulevard. The Palace Company ran this one-and-half-story timber frame building with clipped gables, shingle and shiplap siding and diamond-paned windows. It was the best- equipped company store at any CFI location after Pueblo. *North Gatekeeper's Lodge, 58 Redstone Boulevard. The only one of the two such building's for Osgood's estate left. It is a frame building on a rusticated stone foundation, topped by a cross-gabled roof with decorative vergeboards and broad overhanging eaves. The remains of a ski lift, from brief mid-20th century use as a ski resort, are nearby. *Osgood Castle, south end of Redstone Boulevard, also known as Cleveholm or Redstone Castle. Osgood's estate, designed by Boal, was a 42-room Tudor Revival mansion with interior furnishings personally chosen by the Osgoods on trips to Europe. He entertained guests including King Leopold II of Belgium, John D. Rockefeller and President Theodore Roosevelt. It was listed on the National Register in 1971, the first property in Pitkin County to be so recognized.

According to various reports, the incident involved patients who had been receiving treatment at the hospital and had been prescribed with counterfeit antihypertensive medicines. The spurious medicine(s) triggered a serious adverse reaction by depositing itself in the bone marrow and ending the body's resistance. The generation of white blood cells stopped in the body. Among the symptoms of the disease were a severe chest infection, change in skin colour/pigmentation, low platelet count and blood vomiting. Suspect drugs include Isotab (isosorbide mononitrate), Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), Cardiovestin (simvastatin), Alfagril (clopidogrel), Concort (amlodipine), and Soloprin (aspirin). The medicines were being distributed by the hospital free of charge mainly to poor people. The total number of people who may be at risk after taking medicine from the hospital may be as high as 46,000 according to one report. Crisis In mid- January 2012, several cardiac patients registered with the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) started showing up at different public and private hospitals in Lahore suffering from a sudden drop in platelets and white blood cells and bleeding from different parts of the body. The doctors initially took the symptoms as that of dengue outbreak that had hit the city in the last Fall. However, it was soon realized that the symptoms were seen in a PIC cohort and were more consistent of a drug reaction. As a result, the Department of Health constituted a high-powered committee to probe the incident. Inquiry Almost all victims were from the Lahore area. One fatality was also recorded in Multan. The Chief Minister of Punjab Shahbaz Sharif vowed \\"stern action\\" against those responsible and announced a compensation of Rs. 500,000 each for the victims' families. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) formed an investigation team to probe the incident on the orders of Minister for Interior Rehman Malik. The team arrested some people reportedly involved in the distribution of the medicine. Cases were also registered against three pharmaceutical companies who made the medicine. Investigations revealed that the licence in one of the three pharmaceutical laboratories which supplied the contaminated drugs to the PIC had long expired in April 2011. Despite this, the company continued to manufacture the drugs in bulk and supplied them to government hospitals and open markets. As the death toll exceeded one hundred, the Lahore High Court ordered respondents involved in the case to file their replies by the 30th of January. Tests performed by the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom indicated that one of the five suspected drugs - Isotab - was contaminated. The report also showed that Isotab contained pyrimethamine which is in fact used for the treatment of malaria. The presence of pyrimethamine proved to be toxic. Tests done at the Central Drugs Laboratory in Karachi also verified the presence of pyrimethamine used in certain combinations to treat malaria in a sample of the Isotab tablet (20 mg). The laboratory also declared a batch of Alfagril as substandard. The FIA, while seizing raw material from a Karachi-based factory of Efroze Chemical Industries. The FIA also put names of owners on the Exit Control List (ECL) besides blocking the official website of Efroze Chemicals. The sealed factory was located in Korangi Industrial Area, Karachi. The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) condemned that a lapse in quality control while acquiring medicines was the main reason for the deaths caused by drug reaction and has demanded the federal and provincial governments to establish a drug regulatory authority. International reaction Following the incident, Sri Lanka banned its import of medicines from Pakistan as a precautionary measure. Moreover, the World Health Organisation issued a global drug safety alert (no.125) calling for increased vigilance on the use of Isotab manufactured by Efroze Chemicals.

On June 22, 2011, it was reported that the Head of the OSCE Mission to Moldova, Philip Remler, met Cazac and confirmed that he was in good condition. Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat met the mother of Cazac, Stela Surchicean, on June 22.

After James's death, Justine sold the house in 1887 to Irish immigrant Edward Rutledge, vice-president of the Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company and an assistant to Frederick Weyerhaeuser.

Currently, he is a group leader at Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and heads a research group. Education In 1981, Siddiqi completed his Master of Science in chemistry from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Afterwards, his research, under the guidance of prof. Franklin Stahl, focused on genetic recombination in bacteriophage, which was the topic of his dissertation. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Oregon in 1989. Siddiqi's postdoctoral work was carried out in Indian Institute of Science, situated in Bangalore. Career Siddiqi's research is predominantly in the areas of genetics, plant development and genetic recombination. His research has shown a lot of promise and progress in the areas of meiosis, gametogenesis and apomixis (asexual reproduction) in plants. The fact that the seeds of high-yielding hybrid plants often fail to produce the same beneficial traits of the parent plants has been a limiting factor in revolutionizing agriculture, as it inhibits the hybrid traits from propagating through seeds. Major advances in these areas will help in the development of new plant breeding techniques, which will produce exact genetic clones of hybrid plants by engineering apomixis. From 1992, he is a scientist at Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. He was also responsible for the formation of a plant genetics research group and heads Siddiqi's lab at CCMB. Furthermore, he is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Biosciences, Journal of Genetics, BMC Plant Biology and Journal of Integrative Plant Biology. Awards and honors In 2008, he was elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences. In 2011, he was awarded the Infosys Prize, in the Life Sciences Category, by the Infosys Science Federation for his contributions to improve agriculture.

Dr. McClain is best known for her doctoral dissertation on the history of African Americans in Akron. The dissertation was the first comprehensive history of African–Americans in Akron. While she planned to have her dissertation commercially published, she was unable to see this desire come to pass prior to her death in 1997. The work has been posthumously published online through a joint effort of the McClain family, the University of Akron, and the Akron-Summit County Public Library. She was a native of Akron, Ohio.  Personal background  Shirla Lorraine Robinson was born in 1935 in Akron, Ohio to Dumas and Marcella (née Macbeth) Robinson. She had four siblings, including brothers Dumas and Duane, and sisters Sheila and Faith. She married Henry McClain on April 6, 1957. Together, they had two children, Kelli and Scott. She attended the University of Akron, from where she received her Bachelors and Masters degree, as well as her doctorate in education in 1956, 1970, and 1975, respectively. After earning her bachelor's degree, she taught elementary and secondary education for the first part of her career, additionally serving as a supervisor in the Akron Public School system.  Professional background  After earning her Ph.D. in 1975, McClain joined the faculty of Kent State University in the College of Education, where she taught elementary and secondary education through 1987. She additionally served as a professor of education and assistant director of teacher preparation at Walsh University in Canton, Ohio. During her career, McClain published over 15 articles and 45 academic papers. In 1994, she was honored with the University of Akron's Alumni Honor Award for Excellence in Professional Achievement in 1994.  Dr. Shirla R. McClain Gallery  McClain was instrumental in the formation of Akron's Black History Gallery at the University of Akron. The gallery was inspired by her dissertation, The Contribution of Blacks in Akron's History: 1825–1975. The development of the gallery began to take root, through a collaborative effort by the Summit County Historical Society's plan to establish the John Brown Institute of Black History and a history project of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. In 1985, individuals living in the Akron area began expressing a desire to establish a Black Cultural Center. In 1991, the government officials established a Presidential Blue Ribbon Task Force composed of community leaders, students, faculty, and administrators, chaired by former State Representative Vernon Sykes. In 1992, following research and feasibility studies, the Task Force submitted a report calling for the city to establish a cultural diversity center, which would present the history of African-Americans from Akron, to include a gallery and historical repository. In 1994, the Gallery of Akron's Black History opened at The University of Akron. McClain and Attorney Edward Gilbert served as co-chairs of the gallery's endowment campaign. The gallery's steering Committee, along with McClain, collected artifacts and historical documents and opened the gallery's first exhibit, \\"Blacks in Education\\" in 1997. While working to prepare for the gallery's second exhibit, McClain succumbed to a long battle with cancer. On January 10, 1998, in honor of her work, the gallery was renamed and rededicated as the Dr. Shirla R. McClain Gallery of Akron's Black History and Culture.

Go! Kokopolo – Harmonious Forest Revenge is an action puzzle platform video game developed and published by Tanukii Studios Limited for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare digital distribution service. It was first announced in October 2008 as a title under development for the Nintendo DS, in a series of Developers Diaries in the UK video game magazine, NGamer. It was eventually released on the DSiWare service on August 4, 2011 in the PAL regions, August 11, 2011 in North America, and May 30, 2012 in Japan. The game was removed on August 31, 2014. The game is described by the developers as the \\"world's first chase-em-up\\" and utilizes a hybrid of different gameplay styles, such as maze games, platformers and puzzle elements to create a unique arcade experience. The developers cite arcade classics such as Pac-Man, Flicky, Door Door and Chu Chu Rocket as inspiration for the main gameplay mechanics, and video game characters, such as Wario, for the mischievous humor abundant in the game. Go! Go! Kokopolo was met with very favorable reviews upon its release, receiving an 8/10 from NintendoLife, and an 8.5/10 from IGN. Several minor criticisms were leveled at the difficulty of the game, especially in later stages, but an easy mode was included to help lend an easy learning curve for more novice players. The game also featured highly in the Best of 2011 lists on Joystiq, WiiLoveIt, IGN and NintendoLife. Gameplay Screenshot of Go! Go! Kokopolo. The enemies chase Kokopolo on the top screen... The goal of each stage is to clear the map of all the peaceful enemy characters, many of which will not attack until provoked. The player takes control of Kokopolo (or Tatsumo) who can stroll around the stages with the D-Pad, or dash quickly around the stage with one of the shoulder buttons. Knowing when to walk, and when to dash, is actually a key component of this game. The player can also jump with the A button, or scratch with the B button. All of these actions take place on the top screen. Upon beginning a stage, the player's objective is to locate the enemies, who are confined to specific paths, and scratch them in order to turn them angry. Once they become angry, they lunge in the direction of the player, attempting to harm him. If you do not dash away, you will get hit, and lose some energy, however if you do dash away, then an epic chase begins. Any angry enemies will chase a dashing player, following his every move, until they are lured into the clutches of a hungry carnivorous plant. These Snap Snap plants are located in each stage, and all enemies must be lured into its mouth in order to destroy them. It is possible to create long chains, of up to 20 enemies at a time, by using a move called the \\"Slash Dash\\". This allows the player to slash other enemies whilst being chased, and not to lose speed. Long chains of enemies get the most points when lured into the Snap Snap plant, but they also can be dangerous as they leave a deadly trail behind the player until they are defeated. When enemies are eaten by the Snap Snap plant, they appear on the lower screen, where the stomach of the plant is shown. In order to help the plant digest the enemies, and destroy them once and for all, the player has to tap on the enemy's portrait with the stylus, or his thumb. If done correctly, a piece of fruit is spat out into the stage as a reward, but if done incorrectly, a bomb is thrown out. The lower screen also doubles up as a helpful map when the plant's stomach is empty. ... and end up in the stomach of the plant on the lower screen. Once the level is cleared of enemies, the player continues to the next. There are 80 stages in all, spread over a variety of worlds, and introducing new enemies and hazards as the game progresses. Every 8th stage is a Boss Battle, which is spread over both screens, and employs a variety of skills to defeat the boss, most of which involve tricking it into destroying itself. The game also occasionally uses the microphone. Most notably to shout into and wake up sleeping Snap Snap plants, or to blow into in order to free the player from the clutches of various enemies. Bonus rounds are unlocked by collecting 20 fruits whilst in mid-air, in order to reveal secret bonus doors hidden in every level. Collectable Scratch Cards are found by chasing small butterflies located in every stage ending in 1, 3, 5 or 7. Plot =Story= The game opens with a nice and peaceful, carefree scene. The wildcat, Kokopolo, is quietly snoozing away in his favorite hammock, whilst his buddy, Tatsumo, is relaxing under a tree, peacefully reading a book in the shade. High up in the sky, a friendly sky-guardian, Jinbe, zooms across the heavens, drumming a catchy tune on his mystical set of bongo drums. Suddenly, by accident, one of the bongo drums becomes dislodged, and quickly plummets earthwards, into the dense forest below. In a one in a million chance, the misplaced bongo impacts directly on the sleeping wildcat's head, with a mighty force, waking him suddenly from his tranquil nap. Seething with anger after being rudely awoken, Kokopolo glances upwards, spotting the unwitting Sky-Guardian flying away, and vows revenge on all the peaceful woodland creatures for this heinous act. Kokopolo leaps out of his hammock, grabs his buddy Tatsumo, and sets off on a furious quest to bring chaos and disruption to the entire land. The Hyperactive Wildcat, Kokopolo. Hero or Anti-Hero? =Characters= *Kokopolo: A hyperactive wildcat, and the \\"hero\\" of Go! Go! Kokopolo. Gets riled up at the slightest annoyance, and decides to take it out on everyone by ruining their fun. *Tatsumo: A laid-back okapi. Kokopolo's buddy, who rarely gets involved in Kokopolo's insane antics, preferring a peaceful life instead. *Jinbe: A peaceful sky-guardian, and the main \\"enemy\\" of the game.

Is the only creature in existence who can annoy Kokopolo. Development and release Go! Go! Kokopolo was first featured in a series of Developer's Diaries in the UK magazine NGamer back in late 2008. It followed the early stages of production of the game, from its initial conception as right up to the point of release. Lead designer, Keith Webb, stated that one of the original inspirations for the game came from a stray white cat, that was adopted by his family when he was younger, which would occasionally lash-out and scratch people uncontrollably, then frantically dash away. This, along with a passion for classic arcade games, such as Pac-Man, and Flicky, led Webb to develop the unique gameplay mechanic on which the entire game revolves around. After considering developing the game for the Neo Geo Pocket, then later the Game Boy Advance, Webb later revised the plan to bring it to the Nintendo DS, years later, and make use of the dual-screen layout for additional gameplay mechanics. Webb commented that at this time he planned out the entire game meticulously, so that when it went into full production, it would be very easy to develop with additional time allowed for tweaking, if needed. At this point, Webb worked on the entire Graphics set for the game, getting it ready to show to potential publishers to gauge any interest. After several unsuccessful attempts to get a publisher on board, Webb eventually got in contact with a small Hungarian team of programmers, Room 4 Games Limited, to help get the game ready for release on the then newly announced DSiWare service. Funded entirely by Webb, the coding team consisted of 2 programmers, Szilard Peteri and Gergely Kiss. Kiss provided most of the gameplay programming for the game, while Peteri was responsible for the engine code. Webb took on duties as the producer, lead designer and lead artist / animator on the project, music was provided by 2 dB music production and sound effects by Hungarian team, Noteblender. A multiplayer mode was planned at one point early in development, but was considered to be too risky to implement with such a small team, and was decided to be saved for any potential sequels. The layouts of the stages in the game went through several iterations, as the developers felt that this was one of the most important aspects of the game to get right, due to the limited viewport of the DSi's screen resolution. The developers also talked about including a secret ending in the game, which they believe no-one will ever find. The Game was released in PAL regions on August 4, 2011, and in North America on August 11, 2011. Once released, a game-breaking bug was found in the game, which prevented players from passing a certain boss. The developers quickly located and fixed this bug, which was solved with an automatic update. Embarrassed by this, Webb released a small humorous comic strip, based on the glitch, to apologize to players whilst they were waiting for it to be fixed. Reception Since its release, Go! Go! Kokopolo has received a positive reception, being awarded an 8.5/10 score from IGN, and an 8/10 from NintendoLife, along with many other similar scores. Critics praised the game for its stunning visuals and colorful sprites, and its fast and frantic, heart-pounding gameplay. Luke Plunkett from Kotaku describes Go! Go! Kokopolo as a \\"hidden gem\\", and Lucas M Thomas from IGN commented that it was \\"a joy to see DSiWare still bringing out fresh concepts and creative new characters like this\\" and that the game is \\"bold, imaginative and different than anything you've ever played before.\\" Several reviewers have criticized the high level of challenge found in the game, and in some cases suggested it may have benefited from an easier difficulty setting. However, many have commented positively on the length of the game and the quality of the presentation, stating that it was obviously planned as a full-retail release, and lost nothing in the transition to the DSiWare service. The game received its lowest score of 3/5 from NGamer, which notably was the magazine that gave the game the most exposure in the first place, eventually leading to its creation. At the end of 2011 Go! Go! Kokopolo was nominated for several awards, including IGN's best of 2011 awards, NintendoLife's \\"game of the year awards\\" and WiiLoveIts DSiWare game of the year award, in which it won second place. Joystiq also included the game in their 2011 Buyers Guide. Sequel On August 29, 2012, a sequel was announced titled Go! Go! Kokopolo 3D: Space Recipe for Disaster. It includes over 80 new stages, the enemies from the first game have returned in the sequel and 10 new bosses for the player to destroy, who can now collect many different secret recipe cards throughout the game, and it was released on February 23, 2017 on the Nintendo eShop. Secret Ending (Peaceful Ending) On April 6, 2012, a secret \\"peaceful\\" ending to the game was discovered by Alejandro Anez, and uploaded to YouTube. The developers announced that Anez's name would appear in some form in a sequel or spin-off as a reward for being the first player to find the secret ending, which was discovered by simply refusing to attack the first enemy in the game.

When she hears that Hwi-do's mother had a traumatic fall and is now brain-dead, Yeon-hee eagerly attempts to purchase the heart. But Hwi-do refuses until he can find out more about what led to the fall. Starring Kim Yunjin and Park Hae-il in the lead roles, it is the directorial debut of Yoon Jae-keun, who previously wrote Hello, Schoolgirl (2008). The film had a total of 1,032,942 admissions nationwide. Plot Yeon-hee (Kim Yunjin) is the principal of a prestigious English-teaching preschool in Gangnam. She is a well-off widow, and a devout Christian. Yeon-hee remains hopeful in her faith that her daughter Ye-eun will be able to get a heart transplant surgery. But Yeon-hee has hired black-market organ dealers to search a healthy heart for her daughter. One donor is a live illegal immigrant, and Yeon-hee cannot bring herself to take his life in exchange for sending money to his family abroad. Time after time, the donors slip through her hands. Tired of waiting, Yeon-hee takes matters into her own hands, and betrays her conscience. She pays an exorbitant amount of money to arrange a transplant: the donor is a patient in a persistent vegetative state, and thus unable to consent. Yeon-hee rationalizes to her doctor friend that the vegetative patient is an answered prayer and pleads him to perform the transplant. Out of her guilt, Yeon-hee monologues to the patient, and cries that she would even go to hell for the illegal surgery, if it could save her little Ye-eun. When the time nears for her daughter's heart transplant surgery, Lee Hwi-do (Park Hae-il), the son of the woman in the vegetative state, suddenly appears to stop the transplant. In the past, Hwi-do was a bad son often leeching money off of his mother. He parted ways with his mother, but when he learns of the current situation he tries to protect his mother. With only a single heart, Yeon-hee and Hwi-do are both desperate to save the one they love. Just when Yeon-hee is about to carry the patient in an ambulance, Hwi-do shows up and gets into the ambulance with them. During the ride, he confiscates the transplant contracts from Yeon-hee (signed by Kang, who dated Hwi-do's mother for money), and takes over the driver's seat. Yeon-hee runs after the ambulance, but it is gone. Hwi-do brings his mother to a hospital, but Yeon-hee tracks down the hospital. Hwi-do and his girlfriend visit Ye-eun's hospital room to take Ye-eun captive. Hwi-do decides that he won't abduct Ye-eun, until Yeon-hee calls him that she is sorry for taking his mother. He then kidnaps Ye-eun, of which Yeon-hee's doctor friend notifies Yeon-hee about. Ye-eun records a conversation on her teddy bear while telling Hwi-do that her mother is not a bad person. Hwi-do and his girlfriend form a friendship with Ye-eun. Still, Ye-eun uses the girlfriend's cellphone to text Yeon-hee the consonants of the location of Hwi- do's auto repair shop. Yeon-hee receives the text, and discovers Hwi-do's place. She tases Kang and offers Hwi-do an exchange of persons, which Hwi-do refuses. Hwi-do locks Ye-eun in his car and Yeon-hee keeps his mother in her van. Yeon-hee ambushes Hwi-do and beats him up with a plank from the street, while the organ dealers hired by Yeon-hee help carry Ye-eun to the van. Hwi-do and his girlfriend watch them drive off. Injured, Hwi-do limps to the hospital, to beat up Yeon-hee. Meanwhile, Yeon-hee rushes Ye-eun to the emergency room. Ye-eun tells her on the rolling cot, \\"Why did you hit someone like that? What if he died? I'm scared of you, Mom...\\" Yeon-hee becomes weak in the knees and reflects. Hwi-do arrives and finds Yeon-hee sobbing and listening to the audio recorded by the teddy bear. Yeon-hee repents. She apologizes to Hwi-do and tells him that his mother would have done the same thing as she did, and that he should take his mother home. Hwi-do then finds his mother, and asks her to move her hand. But her heartbeat fails. Yeon-hee weeps with him, and Hwi-do tells Yeon-hee that his mother wishes the transplant to happen. Months later, during Christmas Eve, Yeon-hee and a healthy Ye-eun are in a car on the way to a restaurant. Ye-eun says that the car seems weird, and needs to be checked out. They arrive at Hwi-do's auto shop, where Ye-eun gives her teddy bear as a present to Hwi-do's now-pregnant girlfriend. Hwi-do invites Yeon-hee for dinner. Yeon-hee quietly goes into the back of the shop and smiles at the picture of Hwi-do's mother.

History Built in 1916, it was designed by James Barney Marsh of North Lake, Wisconsin, and constructed by the Iowa Bridge Company at a cost of $13,950. It replaced another concrete bridge built in 1915, which was immediately wrecked by the spring flood of 1916. The use of reinforced concrete in bridges had been pioneered in Germany and Hungary and was controversial in Chippewa then. It was the only bridge over Duncan Creek to survive the flood of 1934, and after 100 years, it is still in good condition.

Details of competence, requirements, qualifications, registration and formal appointment differ depending on jurisdiction and relevant codes of practice. Diving supervisors are used in commercial diving, military diving, public safety diving and scientific diving operations. The control point is the place where the supervisor can best monitor the status of the diver and progress of the dive. For scuba dives this is commonly on deck of the dive boat where there is a good view of the surface above the operational area, or on the shore at a nearby point where the divers can be seen when surfaced. For surface supplied diving, the view of the water is usually still necessary, and a view of the line tenders handling the umbilicals is also required, unless there is live video feed from the divers and two-way audio communications with the tenders. The control position also includes the gas panel and communications panel, so the supervisor can remain as fully informed as practicable of the status of the divers and their life support systems during the dive. For bell diving and saturation diving the situation is more complex and the control position may well be inside a compartment where the communications, control and monitoring equipment for the bell and life-support systems are set up. In recreational diving the term is used to refer to persons managing a recreational dive, with certification such as Divemaster, Dive Control Specialist, Dive Coordinator, etc. Responsibilities The professional diving supervisor is the person legally responsible for the health and safety of the personnel engaged in a professional diving operation. The supervisor is appointed for a specific operation by the diving contractor, and has the following responsibilities during that operation: * to ensure that the planned operation is carried out as far as it is reasonably practicable— ** without unacceptable risk to the health and safety of all those taking part in that operation and of any other person who may be affected by the operation; **in accordance with the requirements and prohibitions of any relevant laws or regulations; **in accordance with the relevant authorised code of practice; **in accordance with the company operations manual; and **in accordance with the diving project plan. *to ensure that relevant hazard identification and risk assessment has been carried out for the project, to update it to suit the actual conditions on site, to communicate the findings of such HIRA to all members of the diving team, and ensure that it is understood and accepted by the affected parties before diving operations commence. *to ensure that all affected parties are aware that the diving operation is imminent, and that all required signals, notifications, lock-out and tag-out procedures are in place; *to ensure before starting the operation that everyone taking part is aware of requirements of the diving project plan which relate to that operation and that person; *to ensure that all members of the diving team are medically fit for the work they are allocated, suitably qualified, in-date and registered, as applicable, and competent to do the scheduled work with the allocated equipment. *to ensure that all pre-dive preparations and checks have been satisfactorily completed; *to instruct the working diver to enter the water to start the dive; *to monitor the progress of the diving operation and condition of the divers, and to manage gas supply, communications and decompression; *to call a stop to operations and recall the diver if circumstances warrant; *To instruct the stand-by diver to enter the water and go to the assistance of the working diver if needed; *to record the relevant details of the operation; *to maintain a personal logbook of supervision of diving operations; *to ensure that the details of any recompression therapy are recorded in the logbook of the diver; *to be available throughout the diving operation to deal with any emergencies related to that operation; and *to manage any emergencies that may occur during the diving operation. The supervisor cannot perform these duties while diving. The recreational dive supervisor's legal position and responsibilities are not as clearly defined, and it is common practice for the person to lead a group of divers in the water. The recreational dive supervisor is expected to supervise recreational divers on recreational dives and assist in training recreational divers to the extent specified by the policies of the training organisation with which they are registered. =Logistics and planning= The diving supervisor may also be involved in diving project planning and logistics as an expert on the selection and deployment of diving equipment and personnel. Training and qualifications A candidate for training as a professional diving supervisor is generally selected from the divers employed by a contractor, as a competent diver of the class for which he or she will be trained to supervise, and a reliable person, suitable for taking the responsibility for the health and safety of the diving team and capable of managing the logistics of a diving operation. Training as a diving supervisor is generally carried out by commercial diver training schools, which are usually registered as training providers by a national or international quality assurance body or government department, such as the Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) in Australia, the Association of Diving Contractors - UK (UK ADC) in the UK and the Department of Labour in South Africa. The International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) also registers diving supervisors for offshore work. Several classes of diving supervisor are recognized, associated with the various classes of commercial and other professional divers, and these can be roughly categorized as scuba supervisors, surface supplied air supervisors, surface orientated mixed gas supervisors and saturation diving supervisors. Training standards and competence criteria are provided to indicate the competence requirements in various jurisdictions. Recreational dive supervisors are trained by recreational diving instructors, and certified as divemasters, dive control specialists, dive coordinators, or whatever the specific training agency chooses to call them, by the agency with which the instructor is registered. Registration and appointment National legislation may require the professional diving supervisor to be registered or licensed by a national or professional organisation. *For offshore work by members of the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), the supervisor must be registered with IMCA, *In the UK, the supervisor is a senior diver appointed by the contractor. There is an industry association certification scheme provided by the UK Association of Diving Contractors *In the Netherlands, the supervisor must hold a certificate issued by the Netherlands Diving Centre Certifying Institute, NDCCI, which is the certifying institute approved by the Council of Accreditation and appointed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. *In South Africa, the supervisor must be registered with the South African Department of Labour. *In Australia, the supervisor for high risk work, such as construction work, is required to be trained in accordance with AS/NZS 2815. This is done through an ADAS supervisor course at a registered school. For low risk work, the supervisor is a diver experienced in the type of work, and appointed by the contractor. The diving supervisor for a specific commercial diving operation is appointed for that operation by the diving contractor. This appointment is a legal commitment by both contractor and supervisor, and the format may be prescribed. In many cases the supervisor may be appointed to supervise the contractor's diving operations as a general condition of employment, but the requirement to ensure that the supervisor is competent and fit to supervise any specific operation remains the responsibility of both contractor and supervisor. These requirements do not generally preclude hiring a supervisor as a subcontractor, but this does not generally transfer the responsibilities of the contractor. Recreational dive supervisors are appointed by the employer. Their responsibilities regarding diving activities at work would normally be defined by their terms of employment and certification. Their authority over clients who are not registered with the same training authority is unclear and may be undefined unless specified in the contract between the client and the employer.

R. Moon Memorial Library is a small public library donated in 1901 by the family of a lumber baron to the community of Stanley, Wisconsin. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History In the late 1880s the Northwestern Lumber Company built a large sawmill in Stanley, under the direction of DeLos R. Moon, the company president at the time. In 1893 the company began to build the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway, to haul lumber from Northwestern's holdings to the mill in Stanley. Altogether, Northwestern was the largest industry in Stanley, employing hundreds of men. Moon died in 1898. Around that time, people began seriously discussing Stanley's need for a public library. Mrs. Sallie F. Moon, DeLos's widow, donated funds for the library as a memorial to her husband, and because of his affection for the community. William Channing Whitney of Minneapolis designed the building in Neoclassical style, a compact 1-story building with T-shaped floor plan and hip roof. The front entrance is a round arch flanked by Doric columns. Inside are more Doric columns, dark oak ceiling beams, and a large brick fireplace with a plaque acknowledging the Moon family. The library was dedicated in a ceremony on December 17, 1901, with a speech by DeLos' son Sumner and with remarks by F.A. Hutchins and Senator J.H. Stout of the State Library Commission. Hutchins \\"declared that for a building of its size, it had no equal in the state, and that the selection of books was the best he had seen.\\" The initial selection of books was given by Mrs. Moon. To that, S.J. McNight, DeLos Moon's successor as president of Northwestern Lumber, donated another 500 books. These included reference books, history, travel, science, children's books, and books in Norwegian, for this community with a large Norwegian population. Though computers and DVDs have been added inside, the building remains largely as originally designed, still serving the community.

Produced by and starring Vin Diesel as the title character, Riddick is written and directed by David Twohy, who previously wrote and directed the first two installments, Pitch Black (2000) and The Chronicles of Riddick (2004). The film was released on September 6, 2013, in the United States. It was shown in both conventional and IMAX Digital theaters. Plot Five years after Kyra's death, Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and assassination attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve what he calls transcendence. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive. Riddick emerges from the rubble with a broken leg, which he sets and splints while fending off native predators: vulture-like flying animals, packs of hyena-like beasts and swarms of venomous, scorpion-like water-dwelling creatures called Mud Demons. Needing time to heal, Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. After he's fully healed, Riddick notices a vast savanna beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is impeded by several muddy pools infested with Mud Demons. He begins injecting himself with Mud Demon venom in order to build an immunity and constructs improvised melee weapons, as well as raising and training an orphaned hyena-beast pup. He kills the Mud Demons and reaches the savanna. After finding a dormant mercenary station, Riddick notices a series of approaching storms, and concludes they will unleash an unidentified threat. Riddick activates an emergency beacon at the station, which broadcasts his identity to mercenary groups within the area. Two mercenary crews promptly arrive in answer to the beacon. The first, a barbaric group led by violent and unstable Santana, and consisting of second-in-command Diaz, preacher Luna and hunters Falco, Rubio, Vargas and Nunez. The second, a team of professional mercenaries; leader Colonel R. \\"Boss\\" Johns, second-in- command and marksman Dahl, tracker Lockspur and gunner Moss. Riddick leaves them a message promising they will all die unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio, Nunez and Falco are killed by Riddick during the first night, forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns' team. Riddick later steals power nodes from each of the teams' ships and approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However, the conversation turns into an ambush as Dahl shoots Riddick with several rounds of horse tranquilizer, and Riddick's hyena-beast is shot and killed by Santana. Back at the Station, Johns interrogates Riddick about the fate of his son, William J. Johns (the mercenary from Pitch Black). When the storms reach the station, Riddick's threat is revealed as thousands of Mud Demons emerge from hibernation underground, awakened by the rainwater, and besiege the station, killing Lockspur and Moss. Johns agrees to release Riddick in order to locate the hidden power cells, but Santana attempts to kill Riddick because he is worth twice as much dead as he is alive, and because Riddick promised to kill Santana within five seconds if set free. Riddick, with only one leg free, beheads Santana with his own machete, with Dahl remarking \\"that was five seconds.\\" The group then releases Riddick on the condition he retrieve the nodes and each party gets a ship. They fight their way to the ships, however Vargas is killed by a mud demon. Johns, Diaz and Riddick leave the ship together on the hover-bikes to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey, Diaz knocks Johns' bike over the side of an embankment, causing him to crash. He is then picked up by Riddick. After they reach the power nodes, Riddick reveals Johns' son's morphine addiction, as well as his attempt to utilize a child as bait for the creatures. Diaz attempts to kill Riddick and Johns but Riddick fights and kills him, however as Diaz dies he shoots and disables the last hover bike, having already sabotaged the other. Riddick and Johns fend off a seemingly endless horde of Mud Demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded and Johns takes both nodes and abandons him. Riddick begins to fight a futile battle against the advancing Demons whilst climbing a rock spire. Just when it seems he is about to be killed, Johns arrives in a repowered ship and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Giving him the other ship, Johns asks Riddick where he intends to go, before deciding he is better off not knowing. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space.

At first, Twohy assumed that the film would be an independent, low-budget production, rather than being released by Universal Studios as the other films in the series had been. Despite the second film's tepid reception, Diesel and Twohy remained optimistic about a third film, pushing it toward completion. \\"Everyone knows I love the Riddick character and I'm always working on it\\", Diesel asserted. \\"It just takes five years to make another one because David Twohy and I are so precise about it.\\" In 2006, Diesel agreed to make a cameo in Universal's film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift in exchange for the ownership to the rights to the Riddick franchise and character. Over the next four years, Diesel periodically posted information on his own Facebook page updating fans on the film's progress. In November 2009, shortly after Twohy had finished the script, he announced that pre-production work was underway. In April 2010, a review of the Riddick screenplay (it was then subtitled \\"Dead Man Stalking\\") appeared on the Coming Attractions website. \\"Free from the constraints of delivering a PG-13 movie, the dialogue in Dead Man Stalking is more suited to a film like Training Day; the mercs we meet are hard-living people, not those washout fakeout space mercs from a film like Alien: Resurrection\\", wrote reviewer Patrick Sauriol. On February 9, 2010, Diesel confirmed in an update on his Facebook page that one of the locations used in the upcoming sequel would be the White Desert in Farafra, Egypt. He mentioned the terrain features, unique to the area, would lend to the off-planet atmosphere of the film. On March 13, 2011, Diesel released a video on his official Facebook page in which he and Director David Twohy talk about the proposed third film. They reaffirmed that the movie will be rated 'R', like the first one (Pitch Black), a priority for them, and they plan to shoot it lean and quickly. In September 2011, it was announced that Karl Urban would reprise his role as Vaako from The Chronicles of Riddick. In January 2012, it was announced that Katee Sackhoff and Matt Nable had also joined the cast. Since they did not have enough money to shoot the film in its entirety, Diesel had to mortgage his house, obtain loans and spend most of his personal money on the production of the film, \\"I had to leverage my house,\\" Diesel said. \\"If we didn't finish the film, I would be homeless.\\" =Principal photography= The first image of Vin Diesel on the film's set was released on January 20, 2012. Filming began in January 2012 and concluded at the end of March 2012. The film entered post production in April 2012. The teaser trailer for the film was released on March 22, 2013 via Vin Diesel's official Facebook page. Reception =Critical response= David Twohy promoting Riddick at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con Riddick was met with mixed reviews. At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 57% approval rating based on 168 reviews, with an average score of 5.3/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"It may not win the franchise many new converts, but this back-to-basics outing brings Riddick fans more of the brooding sci-fi action they've come to expect\\". Metacritic, another review aggregation website, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 49 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a negative review, saying \\"If you were to make a comedy about an actor who makes cheesy sci-fi action movies, and you needed a hilarious clip of his work that underscored the awfulness of his output, just about any 30-second segment of Riddick would do the trick\\". Tom Huddleston of Time Out gave the film two out of five stars, saying \\"It's flavourless: the aliens are unscary and easily despatched, Vin's too silent to be interesting, and the other characters are either dull or offensive\\". Scott Foundas of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying \\"An improbable but very enjoyable sequel that recaptures much of the stripped-down intensity of Diesel and director David Twohy's franchise starter Pitch Black.\\" Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying \\"Faithful to the template if not the spirit of previous installments, this flabby second sequel barely manages to advance Riddicks considerable personal mythology\\". Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+, saying \\"Twohy succeeds in staging moments both tense and funny, but they're fewer and farther between than one would hope, and the dialogue is served up with a heaping helping of cheese, especially when delivered in Diesel's low-frequency growl\\". =Box office= Riddick grossed $42,025,135 in North America, and $56,312,160 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $98,337,295. In North America, the film opened to number one in its first weekend, with $19,030,375. In its second weekend, the film dropped to number three, grossing an additional $6,841,800.

Riddick looks out the window as he is told that Vaako has gone to achieve transcendence, where he is both dead and alive. Sequel On January 29, 2014, Vin Diesel had announced on his Facebook page that Universal Pictures wishes to develop a fourth Riddick film prompted by robust DVD sales of the most recent film in the series.Han, Angie (2014-01-28). \\"Universal Wants a 'Riddick' Sequel, Says Vin Diesel.\\" SlashFilm.com.

It was released on 2 February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and the Xbox One consoles. Gameplay =Game modes= Cobalt features 5 game modes: *Deathmatch: A type of the game mode where various weapons and throwables are spawned across the map, which are to be picked up. Players can play free-for-all deathmatch, or with teams. Up to 8 players can play in a multiplayer match. *Team Strike: At the beginning of each round, players buy one of six classes, which each have certain advantages and disadvantages. Players then play in 4 vs. 4 eliminations. As soon as a team is eliminated, a new round begins. They can play in their character's current condition, repair their character, or sell it to get a new class. 8 players can participate in a multiplayer match. *Plug Slam: Like deathmatch, various weapons are placed on the map. A plug is placed in the middle of the map. The goal is for the player to get the plug into the opponent's goal. *Survival: At the beginning of a wave, players buy equipment, then must survive attacks, occasionally receiving objectives. Once a wave is over, players have the ability to upgrade their equipment. *Challenge: These are time-driven challenges which test players' ability in speed and combat. **Speed: Speed challenges are time-based and require players to pass through all checkpoints until they get to the end. Obstacles may be present, such as enemies and turrets. **Combat: Combat challenges are also time-based and have targets that players must kill. Their score increases by performing actions like saving prisoners and taking out optional enemies. Players play as the main character, known as Cobalt. Some key mechanics of the game include bullet time, rolling (to deflect bullets) and punching which can deal damage and knock back explosives, all of which a player can combo together to produce an advanced level of play. Development =Alpha= Cobalt was released in its alpha stage of development. Updates to subsequent versions of the game are free. The alpha version was initially only available for the Windows operating system. A macOS version was released on 27 June 2013, however the game was re- announced as an Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive at Gamescom 2014.

She works with several forms of digital media, including photography, projections, and video-sound installations. Through a multitude of processes, Lutter's oeuvre focuses on light and its ability articulate the passing time and movement within a tangible image. Biography =Education= In 1991 Lutter received her degree from the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich where she trained as a sculptor. Thereafter, she enrolled in the Photography and Related Media program at the School of Visual Arts in New York, earning her MFA in 1995. =Work= In the early 1990s, inspired by her move to New York and the city's light and architecture, the artist undertook her first experiments with the medium of pinhole photography. To capture a direct imprint of her environment, Lutter transformed the loft in which she lived into a camera obscura. Rather than using an optically carved lens Lutter found her focus through the aperture of a pinhole, projecting inverted images of the outside world onto mural-sized sheets of photographic paper. By exposing images directly onto photo paper instead of film the artist produces unique negative prints in an effort to maintain the immediacy of her images; a departure from the reproducibility associated with conventional photography. Lutter's most prominent work utilizes a room-sized camera obscura to capture her large black and white negative images. The subject matter of her work varies greatly from urban centers, industrial landscapes, abandoned factories, and transit sites, such as shipyards, airports, and train stations. The artist's home, New York has stayed a recurring subject in her work from many points of view, including Manhattan, the Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City, Queens, Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan, the former Nabisco factory in Beacon, as well as documenting the evolution of a construction site seen from her studio window. Lutter has also worked internationally, making images at the Frankfurt airport, the pyramids of Egypt, the Battersea power station in London, Venice, and the Rheinbraun surface mine in Hambach Germany. In advancement of her process, Lutter has incorporated her camera obscura images into architectural installation works. The first was Linger On in 2005, for which the artist printed a semi-translucent variant of her 1999 photograph of the Friedrichshafen Zeppelin onto large panels of acrylic. Lutter's work often deals with urban landscapes (Venice Portfolios, 2007). Later with Folding Four in One (2009), Lutter captured views from a clock tower in Brooklyn. Situated at the highest part of the building, the interior space of the clock tower is perfectly square with each of its four sides housing a large clock face. Backed with clear glass, each clock facilitates the entrance of light while demonstrating the steady evolution of time. With a camera obscura, Lutter made exposures of four different vistas of New York onto large sheets of film emulsion. The large-scale negatives were thereafter set between pieces of acrylic and installed in a square formation, suspended between floor and ceiling. Each image depicts one cardinal view seen from the tower, offering the experience of inhabiting an alternate time and space. These installation projects not only underscore the monumentality of Lutter's art, but also serve to reiterate the structural potential of light itself as the works become a literal part of the viewer's environment. But Lutter hasn't always worked exclusively with the camera obscura. In her project Samar Hussein (2009) the names of the estimated 100,000 civilian deaths caused by the American-led war on Iraq since the invasion on 20 March 2003 were accompanied by both printed and projected color images of the Hibiscus flower's life cycle. Lutter first explored the possibilities of color photography with Jai Brooklyn, a project produced in 2003/2009 memorializing the civilian deaths caused by the Iraq War. The names of those lost are displayed along the bottom of a projection of rotating images of a hibiscus plant in various stages of bloom and decay. One Day stands as Lutter's first and most recent work in video and sound installation. For this piece, the artist made a twenty-four-hour recording in the Petit Camargue nature preserve just outside the French town of Saint- Louis. Through a fixed frame, Lutter captured a full day's cycle with all its subtle transformations in atmosphere. Concurrently, Lutter pursued new avenues in digital astronomic photography with the creation of Albescent, an ongoing project chronicling the ebb and flow of the moon. Since 2010, the artist has amassed numerous images of the sun and moon from international vantage points building a travel diary that considers the ubiquitous presence of these celestial bodies. In 2012 Lutter began photographing works of art. This process began first at The Metropolitan Museum in New York, followed by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and more recently with a commission from the Museum of Modern Art in New. The resulting works act as both documentation and interpretation of the familiar in an unfamiliar manner. The time it takes to make such images can run as long as seven months and are exposed directly onto black and white photographic paper, leaving them in their negative format. In 2017 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) invited Lutter to be their first ever artist in residence in response to the Museum's upcoming campus demolition and subsequent renovation. Using her room- size camera obscura process Lutter has been documenting the campus, galleries, and the museum's collection. The project is taking place since February 2017–Present and culminating in an upcoming exhibition in 2020.

The film premiered nationwide in the Philippines on June 13, 2012 and became the second highest grossing Filipino film of 2012, earning in two weeks, and currently holds the fifteenth place in the highest- grossing Filipino films of all time. It tells the story of twin sisters Kimmy and Dora, both played by Eugene Domingo, in their quest to find love in South Korea. Plot At a gala event for the GoDongHae conglomerate's new airline, Kimmy, daughter of company chairman Luisito, is shocked to find that her outfit comically matches the decorations put up by her younger twin Dora, and fires the staff in an outrage. Soon after, Luisito receives a package, and he and his daughters vacation to Korea. On the plane, paranormal events begin to occur, which can only be seen by Dora and heard by Kimmy. In Korea, Luisito also begins to experience supernatural visions. He then tells his daughters that one of them must marry the grandson of the Sang family, Daniel, as the Sangs had helped Luisito's family with their business in the past. Neither twin is willing to marry Daniel as both have boyfriends, however Daniel takes a liking to Dora. Back home, Kimmy and Dora continue to experience supernatural occurrences. Kimmy is haunted by mysterious drum-beats and eventually faints. After recovering at the hospital, Kimmy is visited by her boyfriend Barry who proposes. Barry is later attacked by a ghost in the elevator and is found alive but paralyzed in a state of shock. On a date, Dora's boyfriend, Johnson, proposes to her but is soon attacked by the ghost as well. Luisito explains that the ghost is that of his ex-fiancée from the Sang family, Sang Kang-kang, to whom he was betrothed as a young man. However, while in studying in the Philippines, he met and was (forcibly) married the twins’ mother, Charito. Upon finding out, Sang Kang-kang locked herself in her room, continually beating a drum until she wasted away and died. Now her vengeful spirit has returned and can only be heard by Kimmy and seen by Dora. That night, when Luisito refuses to have his daughters marry Daniel and amend his ties with the Sangs, Sang Kang-kang attacks him, leaving him in the same state of shock. Luisito is hospitalized along with Johnson and Barry. Soon after, Kimmy and Dora find the package received by their father, revealed to be Sang Kang-kang's old photo album. Looking inside they find their father and boyfriends imprisoned with Sang Kang-kang who claims they are hers. Lolo, a child shaman, visits the twins and they, along with Manny, a young friend of Barry's, Gertrude, Kimmy's secretary, and Elena, the family maid, attempt a ritual to confront Sang Kang-kang but are overwhelmed by the ghost. With the only option left being marrying Daniel, Kimmy chooses to do so to spare her sister. However, Lolo interrupts the ceremony so they can attempt another ritual. Kimmy, Dora, and the others visit Sang Kang-kang's grave where they are soon attacked. The armor-clad spirit of Charito arrives and battles Sang Kang-kang. Charito is eventually overpowered whereupon she apologizes for Sang Kang-kang's heartbreak. At the same time, Kimmy, Dora, and the others complete the ritual and manage to seal Sang Kang-kang inside the photo album, freeing their father and boyfriends in the process. Charito embraces her daughters and tells them to take care of one another before returning to the afterlife. Soon after, Kimmy and Barry, and Dora and Johnson celebrate their wedding.

The track and facilities which are not obscured by trees are clearly visible on public satellite images. The elevation at Train Mountain varies from at South Meadow, at Central Station, at Ward Passing Track (the highest point accessible by train), to at Steiger Butte, the highest point on Train Mountain property. Longest miniature hobby railroad In the 2004 Guinness World Records, Train Mountain is recognized as the “Longest Miniature Hobby Railroad”. At the time Train Mountain was recognized by Guinness, it was reported to have of gauge mainline track and of total track including yards, sidings, spurs, and connector tracks. During the following years, approximately 10 additional miles (16 km) of new track has been added. Gauge and scale The Train Mountain gauge miniature railway track is typically used for 1.5\\" scale trains (1.5\\" to 12\\" or 1/8 scale). Trains of 2.5\\" scale (2.5\\" to 12\\") are also common at Train Mountain.

According to the trainmountaintriennial.org website, as of January, 2012, pre-registrations for the next triennial include participants from Australia, Austria, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, UK, and the US, and many more are expected. Other train meets for members and those who own, operate, or have an interest in gauge railroading are held seven times a year. These events attract participants from all over the US and Canada. They are popular with live steam enthusiasts due to the uniqueness of the layout, and the ability to operate heavy steam powered locomotives that may not be allowed at other railroads.

Loos had a critical role in the subsequent Batavia Mutiny, becoming the leader of the mutiny after the original leader, Jeronimus Cornelisz (Corneliszoon), was captured. Loos' role in the Batavia Mutiny The Batavia Mutiny is well documented. The first account was published in 1647 in Ongeluckige Voyagie, and a detailed and complete translation of Commandeur Francisco Pelsaert's journal was published by Henrietta Drake-Brockman in Voyage to Disaster in 1963. Drawing from Ongeluckige voyagie van 't schip Batavia (1647) of Batavia Mutiny Loos was aged 24 when the Batavia Mutiny took place. In the course of the mutiny he was accused of being involved in a particularly gruesome and notorious incident in which all the Predikant (minister) Gijsbert Bastiaenszoon's family, apart from his eldest daughter Judith, were massacred in their tent. He was also reported to have bashed in the head of Mayken Cardoes while another mutineer was trying to cut her throat. There was a dramatic change in Loos role, however, on 2 September 1629. Corneliszoon had been inept in his tactics in the conflict that had arisen between the mutineers and another group, the defenders, who had been holding out against them. On the pretext of negotiating, Corneliszoon, accompanied by Loos and four other henchmen, had arranged to meet with the defenders. However, the defenders sprang a trap and tried to take Corneliszoon and his henchmen prisoner. Other mutineers nearby immediately prepared to attack, so the defenders killed all their prisoners on the spot, apart from Corneliszoon, and Loos, who managed to escape. As an anonymous defender described it, \\"by a ruse we took five of the principal murderers prisoner. Seeing this, the others resorted to their weapons. When we saw this, that our enemies wanted to come upon us, we struck four of them dead.\\"Anonymous, p. 9. This was done to \\"avoid being hampered by the prisoners\\".Pelsaert, p. 253. Consequently, Lance-Corporal Cornelis Pieterszoon, Cadets Conraat van Huyssens and Gysbrecht van Welderen, and Assistant Davidt Zevanck were killed on the spot. With their leader Corneliszoon captured and four of their number killed, the mutineers retired in confusion. Loos elected leader of the mutineers The mutineers then regrouped and elected the 24-year-old Loos as their \\"captain\\". Being a soldier, Loos was far more adept in his tactics. On the morning of 17 September the mutineers attacked again, this time using their muskets to telling effect. Four defenders were wounded, one, Gunner Jan Dircxszoon from Emden, later dying of his wounds.'Summary of crimes of Wouter Loos' in Pelsaert, p. 227. But as the two-hour battle reached its climax, the , commanded by Francisco Pelsaert, miraculously appeared.Pelsaert, pp. 227, 253. Forewarned by Wiebbe Hayes, leader of the defenders, that the mutineers intended to capture the Sardam, Pelsaert acted decisively and the mutiny was ended. Pelsaert then set about investigating the mutiny, salvaging the wreck and recovering property. This took a couple of months. Investigations of Loos' role in the mutiny Most participants in the mutiny were subject to judicial torture as part of their examination. Loos managed to resist the torture and diminish his culpability, and so he was not among the seven ringleaders who were hanged on Long Island on 2 October 1629.Gerritsen 2011. However, on 27 October Pelsaert reopened Loos' investigation, the result of the Predikant's daughter Judith raising his complicity in the massacre of her family. This re-examination revealed the true extent of his involvement. Upon his guilt being determined the ship's council then made an unusual decision: instead of hanging Loos, he would be marooned on the coast, along with Jan Pelgrom de Bye van Bemel. De Bye, an 18-year-old cabin boy, had been due to be hanged on 2 October, but had been reprieved due to his youth. Loos and de Bye marooned on Australian mainland Subsequently, on 16 November 1629, Loos and de Bye were abandoned on the Western Australian coast, probably at the mouth of the Hutt River,Gerritsen 2007,2009. with a small boat, trade goods and 'provided with everything.'Pelsaert, p. 237. They were issued a set of instructions which urged them to 'make themselves known to the folk of this land.''Instructions for Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de By van Bemel' in Pelsaert, p. 230. Thus Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de Bye became the first Europeans to become resident in Australia, but they were never heard of again.

Her most notable work involved studies on sugarcane and the eggplant (brinjal) but she also worked on the cytogenetics of a range of plants and co-authored the Chromosome Atlas of Cultivated Plants (1945) with C.D. Darlington. She also took an interest in ethnobotany, and took an interest in plants of medicinal and economic value from the rain forests of Kerala, India. She was awarded a Padma Shri by the Indian government in 1977. Biography Janaki Ammal was born in the Thiyya family of Diwan Bahadur Edavalath Kakkat Krishnan (sub-judge) and Devi Kuruvayi in Tellicherry. Her mother was an illegitimate daughter of John Child Hannyngton (colonial administrator and Resident at Travancore) and Kunhi Kurumbi Kuruvai, who was later a mistress to Walter Gaven King. Frank Hannyngton, Indian civil servant and entomologist, was thus a half-brother of Janaki Ammal's mother.The Mother of Modern Botany in India, A Biographical Journey of Dr Edavalath Kakkat Janaki Ammal Janaki Ammal studied at Sacred Heart Convent in Thalassery followed by Queen Mary's College, Madras. She obtained an Honours degree in Botany from the Presidency College and then moved to the University of Michigan in 1924, obtaining a masters degree in botany in 1926 with a Barbour Scholarship. She returned to India to work as a professor in the Women's Christian College, Madras for a few years,returned to the University of Michigan as an Oriental Barbour Fellow and obtained a PhD in 1931. Her thesis was titled \\"Chromosome Studies in Nicandra Physaloides\\". The University also awarded her an honorary LLD in 1956. On her return, she became Professor of Botany at the Maharaja’s College of Science in Trivandrum (presently known as University College, Thiruvananthapuram, coming under University of Kerala) and served there as Assistant Professor for two years between 1932 and 1934. Janaki Ammal then joined the John Innes Institute, Merton, London, where she worked with C D. Darlington, who would become a long-term collaborator. She then worked at the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Coimbatore and worked with C.A. Barber. Her worked involved the production of hybrids including several intergeneric crosses including the variety SG 63-32. In 1939 she went to attend the 7th International Congress of Genetics, Edinburgh and was forced to stay on due to World War II. She then spent the next six years at the John Innes Centre as an assistant cytologist to C.D. Darlington. Together they published a Chromosome Atlas of Cultivated Plants in 1945. She was invited to work as a cytologist at the Royal Horticultural Society, Wesley from 1945 to 1951. During this period she studied Magnolias, their cytology and conducted experiment on their hybridization. The Indian government invited her to reorganize the Botanical Survey of India, and she was appointed as the first director of the Central Botanical Laboratory at Allahabad. From 1962, she served as an officer on special duty at Regional Research Laboratory in Jammu. She also worked briefly at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay and then settled down in Madras in November 1970, working as an Emeritus Scientist at the Centre for Advanced Study (CAS) in Botany, University of Madras. She lived and worked in the Centre’s Field Laboratory at Maduravoyal until her demise in February 1984. Research As an expert in cytogenetics, Janaki Ammal joined the Sugarcane Breeding Station at Coimbatore to work on sugarcane biology. At that time, the sweetest sugarcane in the world was the Saccharum officianarum variety from Papua New Guinea and India imported it from Southeast Asia. In a bid to improve India’s indigenous sugarcane varieties, the Sugarcane Breeding Station had been set up at Coimbatore in the early 1920s. By manipulating polyploid cells through cross-breeding of hybrids in the laboratory, Janaki was able to create a high yielding strain of the sugarcane that would thrive in Indian conditions. Her research also helped analyse the geographical distribution of sugarcane across India, and to establish that the Saccharum Spontaneum variety of sugarcane had originated in India. However, her status as a single woman from a caste considered backward created irreconcilable problems for Janaki among her male peers at Coimbatore. Facing caste and gender based discrimination. Impressed by her work, the Royal Horticulture Society invited Janaki to work as an assistant cytologist at their campus at Wisley, near Kew Gardens, famous for its collection of plants from around the world. During the years (1939–202)e spent in England, Janaki Ammal did chromosome studies of a wide range of garden plants. Her studies on chromosome numbers and ploidy in many cases threw light on the evolution of species and varieties. The Chromosome Atlas of Cultivated Plants which she wrote jointly with C. D. Darlington in 1945 was a compilation that incorporated much of her own work on many species. At the Society, one of the plants she worked on was the magnolia. To this day, in the Society’s campus at Wisley there are magnolia shrubs she planted and among them is a variety with small white flowers named after her: Magnolia Kobus Janaki Ammal. A flower celebrated in Japanese and Chinese legends, the blooms of this variety are made up of fused sepals and petals called ‘tepals’. Today, only a few nurseries in Europe cultivate the variety. Ammal also worked on the genera Solanum, Datura, Mentha, Cymbopogon and Dioscorea besides medicinal and other plants. She attributed the higher rate of plant speciation in the cold and humid northeast Himalayas as compared to the cold and dry northwest Himalayas to polyploidy.Janaki Ammal .E.K. The effect of the Himalayan uplift on the genetic composition of the flora of Asia. 1960. Indian botan. Soc., 39: 327-334 Also, according to her, the confluence of Chinese and Malayan elements in the flora of northeast India led to natural hybridisation between these and the native flora in this region, contributing further to plant diversification. Following her retirement, Ammal continued to publish the original findings of her research focusing special attention on medicinal plants and ethnobotany. In the Madras University Field Laboratory where she lived and worked she developed a garden of medicinal plants. As a geneticist working for the Royal Horticultural Society's Garden Wisley in the early 1950s, Dr. Janaki was investigating the effects of colchicine on a number of woody plants, including Magnolia, where a stock solution in water is made up and applied to the growing tip of young seedlings once the cotyledons (seed leaves) have fully expanded. Doubling of chromosomes occurs, giving the cells twice the usual number. The resulting plants have heavier textured leaves; their flowers are variable, often with thicker tepals, helping them last longer. As Magnolia kobus seeds were available in quantity, a number of seedlings were treated by Dr Janaki Ammal and ultimately planted on Battleston Hill at Wisley. Awards and honours Janaki is mentioned among Indian Americans of the Century in an India Currents magazine article published on 1 January 2000, by S.Gopikrishna & Vandana Kumar: \\"In an age when most women didn't make it past high school, would it be possible for an Indian woman to obtain a PhD at one of America's finest public universities and also make seminal contributions to her field?!\\" The Kerala-born Ammal was arguably the first woman to obtain a PhD in botany in the U.S. (1931), and remains one of the few Asian women to be conferred a DSc (honoris causa) by her alma mater, the University of Michigan. During her time at Ann Arbor she lived in the Martha Cook Building, an all-female residence hall and worked with Harley Harris Bartlett, Professor at the Department of Botany. Ammal was elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1935, and of the Indian National Science Academy in 1957. The University of Michigan conferred an honorary LL.D. on her in 1956 in recognition of her contributions to botany and cytogenetics said: \\"Blest with the ability to make painstaking and accurate observations, she and her patient endeavours stand as a model for serious and dedicated scientific workers.\\" The Government of India conferred the Padma Shri on her in 1977. The Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Government of India instituted the National Award of Taxonomy in her name in 2000. She produced many hybrid brinjals (Indian name for eggplant).The Michigan Alumnus, Volume 42, Page 532, UM libraries 1935E.K. Janaki Ammal. A polyploid egg plant, Solanum melongena L.

There is herbarium with over 25000 plant species in Jammutawi named after Janaki Ammal. The John Innes Centre offers a scholarship to PhD students from developing countries in her name. Plants named in honour To honour her works in plant breeding, a cross-breed variety of Magnolia variety she created, was named after her at the Royal Horticulture Society’s Wisley campus is named as Magnolia Kobus Janaki Ammal. In 2018, to celebrate her remarkable career and contribution to plant science, two Indian plant breeders, Girija and Viru Viraraghavan bred a new rose variety which they named E.K. Janaki Ammal. The name Janakia arayalpathra is given in honour of Janaki Ammal, and the specific epithet arayalpathra refers to the resemblance of this species leaves with that of Ficus religosa.arayal= peepal tree (Malayalam) and pathra= leaf in Sanskrit.

It is an India-specific lineage. Origin M18 is a descendant of the macro-Haplogroup M (mtDNA) and an ancient Indian-specific variant of M. Haplogroup M18 shares a common coding region mutation (12007) together with the M4, M30, M37 and M38 haplogroups from the root of haplogroup M (superhaplogroup M4'30). M4′30 super-clade is the only clade that shares an intermediate lineage between 2 haplogroups, while the rest of all M lineages have originated independently from the root of macrohaplogroup M; thus supporting the idea of rapid dispersal of modern humans along the Asian coast after they left Africa, followed by a long period of isolation. Awaiting further information from complete mtDNA sequences, the haplogroup M18 was first defined by Metspalu et al., in 2004 by using the transversion at np 16318. This was later revised by Thangaraj et al., in 2006. Currently, the haplogroup is characterized by two coding region mutations, 12498 and 15942, and an additional control region mutation 194. Distribution A 2004 study of Metspalu et al., analyzed mtDNA variation across samples of 796 Indians, 436 Iranians and compared them across samples from Europe, China, and Thailand. The study showed prevalence of M18 at low frequencies across a wide geographical area comprising south-eastern parts of Saudi Arabia, widely across Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Metspalu's study revealed that the spatial distribution of M18 peaked across a portion of Punjab Pakistan, Punjab, India, Rajasthan and across a large portion of Andhra Pradesh (See M18 panel of ). The high incidence (33%) of the M18 nodal haplotype among the Austroasiatic-speaking Lodha of West Bengal suggested a possible founder effect in this population. It also explained the nearly two- fold difference between the coalescence estimates for this cluster calculated with and without the tribal data, in Metspalu's study. Since an intense genetic drift (particularly founder effects) could introduce a bias into the coalescence time calculation, therefore Metspalu et al., calculated the coalescence time of haplogroup M18 with and without the Lodha sample, and found it to be 9,400 ± 3,200 ybp and 17,100 ± 4,700 ybp respectively. Thangaraj et al., estimated the coalescence age of Haplogroup M18 to be 20,800 ± 8900 ybp (Thangaraj et al., 2006). To sum up, Haplogroup M18 individuals have been found in *Saudi Arabia *Iran *Afghanistan *Pakistan *India *Nepal *Bhutan *China *Bangladesh *Myanmar Distribution in India A relatively high frequency of M18 haplogroup was observed in Pardhan of Andhra Pradesh, while it was completely absent in Naikpod Gond and Andh (Thanseem et al., 2006). M18 was found in Brahmins of Uttar Pradesh (Sun et al., 2006), Desasth Brahmin of Maharashtra (Gaikwad and Kashyap, 2005), Khandayats of Orissa (Sahoo and Kashyap, 2006) and Oraon from Bihar (Thangaraj et al., 2006). Chandrasekar A and Raghavendra Rao, et al., confirmed the monophyletic origin of Haplogroup M18, and found it occurring in high frequency in Mal Paharia people (at 29% of sample size). The study by Metspalu et al., found haplogroup M18 across Andhra Pradesh and southeastern part of Tamil Nadu, but completely absent in neighboring Karnataka and Kerala. A possible explanation is the facilitation of admixture along the coastlines of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. However, as the absolute frequency of this haplogroup is rather low, it cannot be ruled out that an increase of sample size would disrupt the observed spread-pattern.

After 45 minutes play, with Sunderland leading 3–0, Kirkham arrived and made the incredible decision to ask Derby if they wanted to start the game from scratch. Derby accepted, meaning the 45 minutes that had already been played were null and void annulled.

Early life Morison was born in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, Ireland in 1862. She came to New Zealand with her parents in 1867 or 1874 and settled in Dunedin. Her father, James Morison, was a master tailor, and her first occupation was as a tailoress. Trade unionist The Kate Sheppard National Memorial: Morison is the figure on the right, wearing a hat New Zealand's first union of female workers, the Tailoresses' Union of New Zealand, held its inaugural meeting at the Dunedin Choral Hall on 11 July 1889. Morison attended, and became vice-president. She \\"threw her whole energy\\" into the organisation of the union, and took over the position of secretary in 1890, which she held until 1896. In February 1891 she went to Wellington to bolster the union branch there, and later that year she conducted a similar mission to Auckland. In 1892 she spent 26 weeks in Auckland rebuilding the local branch, which had been close to collapse. She was largely responsible for the union negotiating a minimum weekly wage of 7s 6d for clothing workers. Morison also campaigned for women's suffrage, which she considered a natural part of egalitarian Christian principles. She organised ambulance classes for women, and was a foundation member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. In 1892, she led a women's movement against Henry Fish's bid for the mayoralty of Dunedin. Fish was a Parliamentary spokesman for the liquor trade and opposed to suffrage. With her friend Helen Nicol, she founded the Dunedin Franchise League, which was independent of the temperance movement. Once suffrage was achieved, the League continued as a charitable organisation for women. In 1896, Morison was dismissed from her post of union secretary. Part of her job was to raise funds for the union, but two picnics she organised in 1895 were unsuccessful due to the weather, and for a carnival in 1896 she failed to keep proper books. There was a suggestion that she had mismanaged or perhaps misappropriated funds, although there was no evidence for this and it may have been an example of infighting. Later life For 14 years, Morison was an official visitor to the Seacliff Lunatic Asylum near Dunedin. The New Zealand Herald obituary describes her as having \\"a keen personal interest in the welfare of the mentally afflicted\\". She was active in the Bible Christian Church, as a lay preacher (one of the first female preachers in New Zealand) and as a chairwoman of the Unitarian Church Committee. In 1906 she became a factory inspector for the Department of Labour in the South Island – the first female inspector in the country – and two years later she moved to Auckland to run a new Women's Branch of the Department. She retired in 1921 when she was made redundant, and after a period of failing health died at her home in New Lynn in 1925. Morison is one of six figures honoured in the Kate Sheppard National Memorial in Christchurch, which was unveiled in 1993 on the 100th anniversary of suffrage in New Zealand.

Morgan joined the Church Missionary Society and attended the Church Missionary Society College, Islington, London in 1832. On the 21 May 1833, Morgan arrived in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, in the Prince of Denmark, to join the CMS mission. In December of that year he worked with William Thomas Fairburn, John Alexander Wilson and James Preece to establish the Puriri mission station in the Thames area on the Waihou River. He moved to the Mangapouri mission station in May 1835, which was located near Te Awamutu on the northern bank of the Puniu River, close to where it joins the Waipa River. On 26 August 1835 he married Maria Mathew Coldham, the sister of Marianne Williams. In about 1842 he established the Otawhao mission station. In 1846 Morgan helped to construct 3 water mills that were built by the local Māori to mill wheat for sale. In 1849 he attended the St John's College, Auckland and was appointed a deacon on 24 June 1849. On 18 December 1853 he was ordained as a priest. He returned to the Waikato and continued teaching in the schools for Māori people. In the early 1860s he acted as a government agent and reported on the Maori King Movement in the Waikato. His activities resulted in his expulsion from Otawhao in April 1863 following the Invasion of the Waikato by colonial government forces. He acted as a chaplain to the military forces in 1863–64.

He is based in Turnberry, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Education and early years (1993–2002) McKenna moved to Worcestershire where he attended the Royal Grammar School at Worcester. He studied at Middlesex Polytechnic Art College in North London. In 1987 he gained a bursary to study at the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture. From 1990 to 1993 he lectured at Stafford College of further education in figurative classical sculpture and at Worcester College of Technology where he taught three dimensional design. He was elected a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1993 and from this point on resigned his lecturing duties to become a full-time profession public art sculptor. In 1996 McKenna sited his sculpture studio at Crown East lane, Worcester. Here he made many of his public art commissions including the 'family of instruments', commissioned by the Crown Estate for Bell Square, Worcester City and the Jersey Cattle group bronze sculpture celebrating the cattle breed 'The Year of the Jersey 2001'. This particular commission saw McKenna's work on the breed of cattle being introduced to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of the Royal Jersey Agricultural & Horticultural building, Trinity, Jersey. Relocation to Scotland (2002) By the year 2002 McKenna was commissioned to produce the main artwork on the Cunard Line transatlantic liner, Queen Mary 2, and his existing studio facilities in Worcestershire were rapidly becoming too small for the greater scale of artworks that he was starting to be commissioned for. Driven by the shortage of economically viable studio space and with the Queen Mary 2 commission contract signed, he relocated the studio to a small holding farm on the South West coast of Scotland. From the new larger studios in Scotland, McKenna was able to create much larger artworks in fabricated metals. The Queen Mary 2 Cunard commission being 20 ft by 23 ft bas-relief in sheet bronze and stainless steel, a portrait of the ship itself. McKenna later went on to create the staircase feature in the sister ship Queen Victoria, again a relief portrait of the ship itself. Both relief sculptures were carrying on the panel theme from the original Queen Mary ship built in Belfast and launched in 1934. Back on land McKenna was commissioned to create a bronze statue of the swineherd Eof, in Evesham, Worcestershire. McKenna's design for Eof was selected in the year 1999 by public competition but it took the town several years to raise the funds to pay for the statue. Larger Public Art projects (2006–present) In 2006 the larger studios at the farm to which McKenna relocated enabled him to extend into fabricating larger stainless steel sculptural structures. The new facilities saw the creation of a colossal mining figure, named 'Jigger' commissioned by the Walsall MBC for a site in Brownhills, Staffordshire. This 5 metric ton type 304 stainless steel sculpture of a miner stands approximately in height, brandishing a pickaxe and lamp, a monumental tribute to the local coal mining industry of this industrial area.Jigger brownhills miner colossus statue by John McKenna It became the biggest representational sculpture figure of a miner in the UK and a significant public artwork for that area of the Black Country. It was named 'Jigger' after Jack 'Jigger' Taylor, a local coal miner, who died in an industrial accident when the roof of the pit at Walsall Wood where he was working collapsed, in 1951. In 2007 McKenna set up the A4A art for architecture studio sculpture foundry where he started casting his own bronze sculpture and statues. McKenna also created a bronze statue The Miner of Auchengeich as a memorial in Moodiesburn, Glasgow. Hovering kestrel by John McKenna sculptor (1) Hovering Kestrel -This stainless steel bird sculpture of a hovering Kestrel measures 6 metres across its wingspan by 4 metres high sited on a building facade 14 metres high. The Kestrel was commissioned by the client for the Citadel Logistics Building on the Black Country Spine route, near Bilston in the West Midlands. The Kestrel concept for the artwork came about through design research work undertaken by A4A associate Steve Field drawin on Natural History information on the former site. Sporting Sculpture statues McKenna's commissions include statues of footballers: Jock Stein at Celtic Park, Glasgow and of Jimmy Johnstone in the Jimmy Johnstone Memorial Garden, Old Edinburgh Road, Viewpark, Lanarkshire. Dorothy Round Little portrait statue in bronze On 20 September 2013 the town of Dudley commemorated the Wimbledon Tennis Champion Dorothy Round by erecting McKenna's lifesize bronze statue to her in Priory Park, Dudley. The statue was cast at the A4A studio foundry and depicts Round making a return play of the ball, based on an old photo, as conceived by Steve Field. It was unveiled by the subject's daughter. McKenna's statue of Billy McNeill outside Celtic Park During 2015 the football club Celtic F.C. commissioned McKenna to create a lifesize statue of the Lisbon Lions captain Billy McNeill. The statue depicts the moment McNeill lifted the European Cup after Celtic won the 1967 final. The statue was unveiled outside the Parkhead stadium on 19 December 2015. Bon Scott In 2016, McKenna's sculpture of former AC/DC frontman, Bon Scott was unveiled in his hometown of Kirriemuir. The statue has been funded via a crowdfunding which had raised over £45,000 to see the work completed.

After war service in the Royal Australian Navy from 1942 until 1944, he became a cadet journalist in the old \\"sink-or-swim\\" tradition. He developed into an uncommonly versatile newspaperman, having extensive experience as a reporter, feature writer, sports writer, columnist, chief State parliamentary gallery reporter and leader writer, and as a general and sporting sub-editor. In 1949 he represented The Sydney Morning Herald, The Argus and The Advertiser in Darwin, then a raffish outpost of empire, and, from 1953 to 1955, worked in the London bureau of The Herald in Melbourne. Between 1960 and 1966, he was part of Channel 7's commentary panel for Australian Rules Football television coverage and from 1966 to 1974, he was State press relations officer for five Royal visits to South Australia. In 1969 he established The Advertiser's cadet counselling school, which he ran for 16 years. Under his guidance, the school gained a national reputation. In 1982 he was awarded a gold honor badge of the Australian Journalists Association for \\"meritorious service\\" and in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours list was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to journalism. He authored two books on the subject of journalism (News Sense and More News Sense), both published by Advertiser Newspapers Limited. Work From 1969, Jervis worked as cadet counsellor of The Advertiser in Adelaide, South Australia. Under his guidance the school he established gained a national reputation. He was said to have left his cadets all with a lifelong love of the written word, a thirst for correct spelling and grammar, and a respect for accuracy and ethics. He was described posthumously by one as \\"incomparably talented and brave\\". Prolific columnist Des Colquhoun once said \\"(Jervis) has had more effect on quality of life in South Australia than the last ten state governments\\". He left a great legacy in the form of his cadets; Many of whom went on to reach the highest ranks of the Australian media. On the day of his retirement, then-Prime Minister Bob Hawke congratulated him on his career and the impact he had on journalism in Australia.

The locomotives had 2 axles, they were the wet-steam type, and used a slip- Walschaert valve gear. Production numbers and years were 7268/1909 and 7858/1910. The fortress was in Finnish hands when Finland became independent. The fortress was not needed after the Treaty of Tartu in 1920. It was therefore decided to cancel the order for the locomotives. But this was not possible so it was decided to use the locomotives in the dismantling of the fortress. In 1919, the second locomotive, 7858/1910, was sold to as an industrial locomotive. The first locomotive continued to work dismantling the fort until 1922 when it was acquired by a building company in Hanko. After this the locomotive was sold to Enqvist Ltd Ab, Tampere who scrapped it in 1951. The second locomotive was purchased by the VR Kuopio depot and given the running number 68. The locomotive was still running in the 1960s. The locomotive was used until 1962 and finally withdrawn in 1967. In the early 1980s it was restored externally and placed in the Kuopio locomotive shed. It was discovered in 1986 by Savo Steam Transport Museum. Unfortunately, the museum project floundered and the locomotive was plinthed outside a restaurant. In 2008 it was decided to restore the locomotive. On 24 March 2009, the locomotive was moved to Hyvinkää workshop, where ultrasound measurements were taken. The final restoration was carried out by ABB Services and the Jokioinen Museum Railway, where the locomotive arrived on 8 May 2009. The locomotive was presented to the public on 17 June 2010.

Reception Theodore Ziolkowski wrote in The New York Times that \\"Grass has chosen his historical analogy with brilliant precision\\" and that \\"the book is diverting as a history of 17th-century German literature, liberally sprinkled with quotations from the works and poetic treatises of the period.\\" Ziolkowski continued: \\"All in all, however, the story remains a lifeless literary construct. The author, whose unerring sense of place put his native Danzig on the literary map along with Kafka's Prague, Joyce's Dublin, and Bellow's Chicago, has not succeeded in giving us a persuasive Westphalian town of the 17th century. With the exception of Dach and the young Grimmelshausen, whose ebullient novels anticipated Grass's own explosive works, none of the literary figures comes alive.\\" See also * 1979 in literature * German literature References Category:Novels set in the 1640s Category:1979 German novels Category:German historical novels Category:German-language novels Category:Novels by Günter Grass Category:Thirty Years' War in popular culture ","title":"The Meeting at Telgte"},{"id":"34542422","text":"The murders of Gene and Eugene Thomas occurred in Wellington, New Zealand on 16 February 1994. Eugene, 68, and his son Gene, 30, were both investment and insurance brokers and owners of Invincible House at 136 The Terrace in Wellington. Their bodies were discovered inside their offices at around 6.30pm by two cleaners. John Barlow was convicted after an unprecedented third murder trial, the first two trials ending in hung juries. The need for three trials caused controversy and raised questions about aspects of the New Zealand justice system. John Barlow Eugene Thomas's pocket diary revealed he had scheduled an appointment with a businessman named John Barlow for 6 pm on the day of the murders. An acquaintance of the Thomases', Barlow was an antiques dealer and a former manager to an insurance company. He was also a gun enthusiast who owned several handguns. Detectives interviewed Barlow on the afternoon of 17 February (the day after the murders), and he gave a statement. =Barlow's first statement= Barlow claimed that he had set up the after- hours meeting to make a business proposal to the Thomases regarding their business in reverse annuity mortgages. He said that upon arriving at the Thomases' office at around 5:45 pm he had taken the lift up to the third floor of Invincible House where he was met by Gene Thomas. Thomas apologized to Barlow for the fact his father was occupied with someone else in another meeting and suggested that they wait in the boardroom. Eugene Thomas called his son into his office. When he returned, he asked Barlow to wait outside, as they needed the boardroom. Barlow suspected that the Thomases did not want him in the boardroom in case he overheard something. Barlow said he waited in the reception area until Thomas Junior came out and apologized, saying that they were \\"trying to get rid of\\" the person they were talking to, but didn't know how long that would take. Barlow said he waited another ten minutes before he left and started to drive home at about 6:10 pm. When he was halfway home, Barlow changed his mind and decided to return to the office to try and talk to the Thomases about his business idea. He arrived back at their office at around 6:25 pm. As he arrived at their office, Eugene Thomas called out \\"Is that you, John?\\" and when Barlow said \\"yes\\", he was told to call back in the morning. Barlow claimed he did not see or hear anyone else. Barlow mentioned that he saw an Asian boy cleaning the steps on the way out, and they said hello to one another. This statement matched the story Barlow had told his wife earlier that morning. =Barlow's second statement= The following evening, 18 February, Barlow presented himself at the Wellington Central Police station to volunteer a second statement, saying he had not been entirely truthful in his first statement. In his second statement Barlow claimed that after being told by Gene Thomas that there would not be a meeting, he had driven halfway home before deciding to return to try and talk with Eugene Thomas, as he had in his previous statement. However, when he got to the office he saw Gene's body inside the reception area. Barlow said he opened the door and saw that Thomas Junior was dead and there was blood everywhere. Barlow then entered the boardroom where he saw Eugene lying back in his chair. There was blood on his face and a telephone receiver in his hand. Barlow said that he did not touch either of the bodies. He said he then left the building, saying hello to the Asian cleaner on his way out. This would have been about 6:35 pm. He said that he did not tell the police everything in his first statement because he was in \\"extreme shock\\" and was fearful of being blamed. Police investigation The police were skeptical of Barlow's statements. They had searched Barlow's house and then car, where they found a receipt from the Happy Valley rubbish landfill. At no time before the discovery of this receipt had Barlow mentioned to the police making a trip to the landfill on the morning of 17 February. The police searched the landfill and discovered a CZ-27 Czech made pistol belonging to Barlow, as well as holster and a homemade silencer that had been cut into pieces, some Geco brand .32 bullets and an envelope with John Barlow's name and address on it. It was determined that the pistol had been fitted with a homemade .22 barrel in place of the usual .32 calibre barrel. The .32 calibre barrel was never recovered. =Recorded conversation= After a press conference about the case, an associate of Barlow's approached the police. This associate, who became a secret witness at Barlow's trials, agreed to wear a hidden microphone to record conversation with Barlow in the hope he might make incriminating statements. During these recorded conversations, Barlow's version of events stayed the same as his second statement to police but with one additional factor: Barlow said that several months earlier he had lent the CZ-27 pistol to Thomas Senior, as Thomas had confided in him that he feared his life was being threatened. He also lent Thomas the homemade silencer so that he would be able to try out the gun discreetly the next time he was out of town. Barlow told the secret witness that when he found the Thomases dead that day, he was shocked to see his gun lying there on the floor. Fearing that the weapon would be traced to him and that he would be blamed for the murders, he seized it and disposed of it the following morning. First murder trial Barlow was arrested on 23 June 1994, about 18 weeks after the killings. His first trial began at the Wellington High Court on 29 May 1995. It lasted three weeks. Barlow pleaded not guilty to the charge of double murder. =Prosecution's case= The prosecution's case was that Barlow went to the meeting with the Thomases that was arranged for 5:30 pm on Wednesday, 16 February. It was not known for certain what the purpose of this meeting was. The meeting was entered into five diaries and was known to a number of people. The prosecution said that the shootings took place after the meeting had been underway for an hour. Barlow's fingerprints were found on a writing pad on the boardroom table. It was disputed as to whether these prints were deposited whilst Barlow was tearing pages from the notepad. The page for 16 February had also been torn out of Thomas Senior's diary. The prosecution alleged that was to destroy evidence of his appointment. =CZ-27 pistol= Central to the prosecution's case was that the CZ-27 pistol Barlow disposed of at the landfill was the murder weapon. It was believed that the murder weapon must have been fitted with a silencer, as otherwise the four shots would have been extremely loud, and no one in the vicinity at the time reported hearing any shots. While it would have been possible to match up the bullets recovered from the crime scene by comparing rifling characteristics with the CZ-27's original barrel, this would prove impossible as Barlow had removed the barrel and disposed of it. Not only had the barrel been replaced, but Barlow had also filed down the firing pin and cartridge case extractor claws as well as substituting the original magazine with a homemade one. The prosecution alleged that Barlow made these alterations in an attempt to prevent the identification of the CZ-27 pistol as the murder weapon. Peter Wilson, a forensic scientist from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) testified that he compared the crime scene bullets with the bullets that Barlow had thrown away at the landfill and concluded that they matched. One of the crime scene bullets was also sent to the Geco ammunition company in Germany, where a computer test confirmed not only was the bullet a Geco brand bullet, but that it was chemically identical to one of the bullets taken from the box of ammunition that Barlow had disposed of at the landfill. =Defence's case= The defence asserted that the Thomases were murdered by a third, unidentified person who used a different weapon, probably a revolver (as bullet cartridges were not found at the crime scene). The defence contended that although Barlow's gun had been found at the crime scene, it was not the murder weapon. The defence theorized that Thomas Senior had taken out the pistol that Barlow had lent him in some kind of an attempt to defend himself. This was supported by the fact that Thomas Senior was found to have residue containing metallic elements, consistent with having fired or handled a weapon in the three hours before his death. The defence pointed out that there was nothing that physically connected Barlow with the killing and despite having tested Barlow's wardrobe, his car, his watch and his eyeglasses — a total of 180 articles — scientists did not find anything that linked him to the homicides. The defence said that Barlow's prints indicated nothing more than that he had been in the room — something that Barlow himself had admitted. A motive for the murders was not suggested by the prosecution, and although Barlow had taken out a loan of about $70,000 with the Thomases, there was nothing to suggest he was not in a position to repay it. After deliberating for two and a half days, the jury decided that its members could not reach a unanimous decision. Second murder trial Barlow's second trial began on 24 July 1995. In this trial the defence presented Robert Barnes, an expert from Melbourne, Australia, to challenge the prosecution. He testified that the bullets which came from Thomas Senior's body did not necessarily come from the CZ-27, but could have come from a large number of similar weapons. He also questioned whether the cut-up silencer had been used. Most other aspects of Barlow's second trial were substantially the same as the first trial. On 25 August, the jury retired to consider its verdict. After deliberating for two days the jury decided it could not reach a unanimous verdict. Third murder trial Barlow's third trial began on 24 October 1995. During this trial, the prosecution presented an FBI expert, Charles Peters, whose test results showed that one murder bullet was unique and that the other three matched some of the bullets found at the landfill. Peters agreed with prosecutors that the compositions of three of the murder bullets were \\"analytically indistinguishable\\" from 14 of the landfill bullets. He furthermore stated that the crime scene bullets came from \\"the same box or a box manufactured on or, manufactured or loaded on or about,\\" the same date as the landfill bullets. The defence once again presented Robert Barnes who disputed these findings. Peters rejected the criticism. Jury deliberations began on 20 November 1995. After 27 hours of deliberation, the jury found John Barlow guilty of double murder. Barlow was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years. Appeals Barlow appealed his convictions in August 1996. His lawyers argued that the third trial was intrinsically unfair under the Bill of Rights; that there were issue of non-disclosure of evidence; and that the trial judge had minimized the importance of the ballistics evidence which was at the heart of their defence argument in his summing up. Barlow's appeal was dismissed. In 2006, the Governor General refused to grant Barlow a royal pardon. =Privy Council= In July 2008, Barlow's lawyer, Greg King, took the case to the Privy Council, who ruled to hear his appeal against conviction. This appeal centered on FBI expert Charles Peters' testimony. King argued that Peters' evidence was flawed and that his position as an FBI agent may have overly impressed the jury and influenced the weight they gave his testimony. An affidavit by Dr. Rick Randich, a metallurgist, gave the opinion that on the basis of the analysis undertaken by Peters, it was not possible to determine who manufactured the crime scene bullets. However, Randich agreed that lead fragments found at the crime scene were consistent with Geco ammunition. The Privy Council concluded that although Peters' evidence may have misled the jury, the circumstantial evidence against Barlow was \\"overwhelming\\". Barlow's appeal was subsequently dismissed. Release from prison After spending more than 15 years in jail, Barlow was paroled from Rimutaka prison. He maintains his innocence.

Institution and specifics of the award  The award was instituted on 22 February 1958 by the Council of Ministers and honoured those who had been involved in the resistance against the Nazi regime; for example, those confined to prisons or concentration camps or sentenced to hard labour, political émigrés, and also members of the International Brigades. Anti-Fascist activity in the National Committee for a Free Germany was also recognised, as in the case of Arno von Lenski (in 1940 made an honorary member of the Volksgerichtshof, later a Major General in the National People's Army of the GDR). The medal could be awarded only once and only to individuals. It was presented by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and was accompanied by a certificate. Beginning in 1964, all holders of the award received an honorarium of 600 marks.  Description  The silver medal, 32 mm in diameter, depicts on the obverse profiles of Rudolf Breitscheid (rear) and Ernst Thälmann (front), looking to the left from the point of view of the observer and encircled in the upper half by the inscription (fighter against Fascism). On the reverse, the arms of the GDR are enclosed by the inscription (forwards and forget not - top) and the years (bottom). The medal was worn on the left upper breast on a rectangular clip with red ribbon, initially 28 mm wide, beginning in 1959 reduced to 24 mm. A black, red and gold vertical bar 7.5 mm high was woven into the ribbon. The corresponding ribbon bar was of the same design.Günter Tautz, Orden und Medaillen: staatliche Auszeichnungen der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik, 2nd ed., BI-Taschenlexikon, Leipzig: VEB Bibliographisches Institut, 1983, , p. 74 Frank Bartel and Jürgen Karpinski, Auszeichnungen der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik: von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart, Berlin: Militärverlag der DDR, 1979, , pp. 157-158  Notable recipients (partial list)  * 1958: Hermann Axen * 1958: Martin Burkhardt * 1958: Käthe Dahlem * 1958: Arno von Lenski * 1958: Peter Florin * 1958: Paul Fröhlich * 1958: Walter Hähnel * 1958: Greta Kuckhoff * 1958: Charlotte Küter * 1958: Paul Lewitt * 1958: Arthur Lieberasch * 1958: Paul Meuter * 1958: Karl Raddatz * 1958: Heinrich Rau * 1958: Elfriede Paul * 1958: Paul Schwertz * 1965: Aleksander Kulisiewicz * 1967: Edith Braemer, Professor of Modern and Contemporary Literature, University of Leipzig * 1971: Doris Wetterhahn * unknown year: Hedwig Voegt (1903-1988) * unknown year: Ferdinand Jung (1905-1973)  References   External links  * Further information Category:Orders, decorations, and medals of East Germany Category:Awards established in 1958 Category:1958 establishments in East Germany ","title":"Medal for Fighters Against Fascism"},{"id":"34542448","text":"Cargo Records is a record label based in London, England, which distributes musical recordings in the United Kingdom and Europe.

It is considered to be the largest single mass murder site of Jews on Russian territory during the Second World War. The name means \\"the ravine of the snakes\\". Wartime events During the course of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia, Wehrmacht troops occupied Rostov-on-Don on 21 November 1941, and held the city for eight days until the Red Army retook the city. The Wehrmacht recaptured the city on 23 July 1942, and were accompanied by Einsatzkommando 10a, commanded by Heinrich Seetzen. The Einsatzkommando and Geheime Feldpolizei initially arrested some 700 people on the grounds that they were Soviet \\"partisans and party functionaries\\" and executed about 400 by 2 August 1942. Although many Jews had fled from Rostov when the city was under the control of the Red Army, about 2,000 remained and the Einsatzkommando began registering them, demanding that they gather at collecting points on 11 August, 1942. Between 11 August and 13 August, the Jewish men of Rostov were marched to Zmievskaya Balka, a ravine outside the city, where they were shot by the Einsatzkommando. The women, children and elderly were gassed in trucks, and their bodies buried in the same ravine. After the initial massacres, until February 1943, the SS continued to bring thousands of Jews to be killed at the Zmievskaya ravine, by when between 15,000 and 18,000 Jews had been murdered in further mass shootings.

Structure and content The plot is composed of many narrative strands and oscillates between fairytale, travelogue and surreal novel. It also contains cinematic perspectives and some poems. Grass incorporates some narrative threads of his success novels The Tin Drum as well as the Butt; further passages on maritime disasters, the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, anticipate aspects of his book Crabwalk.http://www.dieterwunderlich.de/Grass_rattin.htm Grass has conceived the novel as a counter-image to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's picture of the education of the human race: Humanity (Grass used deliberately old-fashioned word \\"mankind\\") have indeed learned \\"the virtue to eat with spoons, diligently the subjunctive and practice tolerance\\", all enlightenment but not their tendency to get their violence under control. In the dreams of the narrator, who seems to be in a spaceship orbiting the devastated earth, a speaking female rat compels the narrator to review the destruction of humanity, and follow their dominant position by rats. Rats build accordingly, in a world destroyed through deforestation, pollution, and nuclear warfare, a new civilization based on solidarity. Against this vision, the narrator developed his own stories leading up to the nuclear apocalypse, partly as film scripts for the including by porn series to Medienzar Oskar Matzerath, the painter Malskat and the restoration of the 50s, from the dead forests and the dying power of Fairy Tales and five beloved women who make up the Baltic officially investigating the local jellyfish population and secretly in search of the legendary Vineta as a place of female utopia.

It offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in science, arts and commerce as well some vocational courses like BBA,BMC & BCA. The college is affiliated to Patna University. It is also considered to be the oldest institution of higher education in Bihar. History Patna College is the oldest institution that provides higher education in entire Bihar state. Nearly every major college of Patna- Patna Law College, Engineering College (National Institute of Technology, Patna at present), Patna Science College and Vanijya Mahavidyala, has their roots from this college. Patna College was established on 9 January 1863, during the British Raj. The paradigm of 20th century education has been appropriated in the history of this college. Accordingly, this ideal college as a complete institution, was to provide multilateral intellectual, social development as its own organization. For years, Patna College remained reputed in state Bihar as the maiden institution for Post-graduate course in humanities. This college has been a leading institution for intermediate, graduate and post-graduate studies in the state of Bihar. It has established a spectacular tradition in the field of education. Patna College After the split up of old Patna University into Patna University and Bihar University on 2 January 1952, the institution saw a significant shift. Until January 1952, the College was a government college and it functioned as an independent unit, but later it became an implied college of Patna University and became responsible only for Undergraduate studies due to the shifting of the burden of Post-graduate learning on University. After the centralization of two years of special honors-teaching, the honors of all art subjects remained in this college. Honors teaching was carried out by the nominated teachers of the Faculty of Arts from all the colleges of the University. In the first two hours, the students of Arts of Honors classes, of other colleges also used to come to study in this college. But due to the gradual increase in the number of students, up to the end of the eighth decade, honors classes of various arts courses were conducted in their respective colleges. Although in 1957, all but the Geography, Sociology and Psychology post-graduate departments were shifted to Darbhanga House. However many teachers of Patna College still have been bearing the responsibility of the postgraduate education by attending the departments in Darbhanga House. There is hardly any change in post-operative activities. Maximum old councils, clubs as well as hostels still is under the Principal of the college. On 9 September 1974, Economics department was split from the Patna College and it took form into Vanijya Mahavidyala. Presently Vanijya Mahavidyala is in the college’s yard itself. Patna College holds a long standing tradition for more than 150 years. Patna College is the maiden college in the entire Bihar that holds the luck to celebrate the centenary ceremony in 1963 itself. The College is also associated with E. M. Forster's novel, A Passage to India. According to Adwaita P. Ganguly, the institution known as Chandrapore College in the novel is \\"a replica of Patna College\\". Forster met Charles Russell and V. H. Jackson, who were professors of the college, in the course of writing his novel, A Passage to India. Forster had collected Hiuen Tsang's Indian Diary from Russell before he made his visit to Barabar Caves that appear as an important location in the novel. A hostel in the campus of the college is named after Jackson. The legendary filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, used the picturesque campus of the college for his award winning film, Seemabaddha. Campus and buildings The administrative block of the college is the oldest of all the buildings. It used to be the site for an opium store-house and a Dutch factory in the 17th century, much before the college was started. Other buildings were constructed gradually over a period of time.

Founded in 1913, by Elizabeth Price Martin and Ernestine Abercrombie Goodman, it promotes the recording and enjoyment of American gardens as well as conservation and horticulture. History The foundations for the organization were laid in 1904, when Elizabeth Price Martin founded the Garden Club of Philadelphia. Among its founding members were author and gardener Helena Rutherfurd Ely (1858-1920) and Henrietta Marion Grew Crosby (1872-1957). In 1913, twelve garden clubs from the eastern and central United States signed an agreement to form the Garden Guild, later to become The Garden Club of America. Among the cofounders and original vice-presidents was Louisa Boyd Yeomans King of Michigan. Objective The recording and preservation of the history of American gardens was an early objective, which saw the gathering of material throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, culminating in the publication of Gardens of Colony and State by Alice B. Lockwood. The book described gardens that had been in existence before the mid-19th century. At the same time, Garden Club members were instrumental in the recording of hundreds of gardens around the country by the use of lantern slides. Much of the importance lies in the documenting of many gardens that no longer exist or that have fallen into disrepair. Much of this material has made its way into the Archives of American Gardens, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution, where it has been stored since 1992. Conservation has been another objective of The Garden Club of America, having promoted the preservation of California redwoods since the 1930s. The club also gives out a $5000 scholarship annually for field research and study of wetlands in the United States. 1935 - Garden Club of America members representing chapters from across the U.S. visit Japan to tour the beautiful gardens of that nation. In 1935, Garden Club of America members representing chapters from across the U.S. experienced an exciting three-week tour of Japan’s most beautiful gardens.

It is north-west of fields and the A4 next to Heathrow Airport. Built in the early 15th century by Winchester College, it is the largest timber-framed building in England and is regarded as an outstanding example of medieval carpentry. It was described by the English poet John Betjeman as the \\"Cathedral of Middlesex\\". A similar though smaller barn is part of the Manor Farm complex in Ruislip. The barn was briefly in royal ownership but passed into the hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group. Structure The barn measures long, wide, and high, with twelve bays, running in a north–south direction. It occupies a footprint of about and has an internal volume of about . There are three doors on the east side to permit the entry of wagons. The exterior of the barn is weatherboarded, with a hipped tiled roof. It was originally a much larger structure, with two wings, but the north wing was dismantled in 1774 and rebuilt in the now-demolished hamlet of Heathrow, on the site of the modern airport. The vast majority of the surviving structure is original; it has been estimated that 95 per cent of the timbers, including the external weatherboarding, have survived from the original building. It has been described by English Heritage as \\"a supreme example of late-medieval craftsmanship – a masterpiece of carpentry containing one of the best and most intact interiors of its age and type in all of Europe.\\" Section of the western side of the barn, July 2015. It is an outstanding example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type were based on a longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting in much the same way as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved. Exterior of the barn The barn's main posts are made of oak. Each is about square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone, a common building material in medieval London. The posts were cut into shape using axes, adzes and saws, the marks from which can still be seen in some instances. The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground and scratched Roman numerals, called assembly marks, on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined. Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two. They were all placed upside down, relative to the original direction of the tree. This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof. Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right, they may have made some mistakes along the way, as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used. Alternatively, the timbers may have been reused from another construction. View of the barn, July 2015, from the north-west. The rows of arcade posts support tie beams, with curved braces to strengthen the frame. The collar beam, which supports the opposing principal rafters, is supported by the crown post. Roof purlins run the length of the barn and are tenoned into the principal rafters, with additional support from curved wind braces. Some aspects of this design are unusual, both in the way that they are executed and in terms of their early date. A number of features in the barn's carpentry are described by English Heritage as \\"experimental, precocious and regionally unusual,\\" which is attributed to the very high level of skill of the master carpenters who built it. The use of aisles enabled the barn's architects to increase its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for threshing floors. The longer the barn was, the more threshing floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution in the number of threshing floors; the earliest had just one central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three threshing floors, allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time. The boards on the exterior of the barn are made from a mixture of oak, elm and softwoods such as pine and fir. Some are of modern or relatively modern origins; those on the south end of the barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire. Each side of the barn's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles, which were originally held in place by oak pegs. Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs have been replaced by galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay. The floor of the barn was originally made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which was used as a more readily available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of the west side of the barn. The design of the barn has provided inspiration to a number of architects in the 19th and 20th centuries who were involved with the Gothic Revival movement. Sir George Gilbert Scott visited the barn in 1850 and sketched it, using its design as the basis for proposals for the new ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand. The library of Mansfield College, Oxford designed by Basil Champneys in the late 1880s also owes its inspiration to the barn. Bedales School's library, completed in 1922 and designed by Ernest Gimson, may also have had its origins in the barn's design. History Location of Harmondsworth Great Barn (marked as \\"Tithe Barn\\") The manor of Harmondsworth was owned before the Norman Conquest by King Harold Godwinson, but was seized by William the Conqueror after Harold's death at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Three years later, William granted it to William FitzOsbern, one of his close confidants. It was subsequently transferred to the Abbey of Rouen. In 1391, it was acquired from the abbot and prior by William of Wykeham, the Bishop of Winchester. He gave it to Winchester College, which he had founded in 1382, as part of his endowment of that establishment. Its revenues went towards supporting the college. There was already a \\"Great Barn\\" on the site, and as early as 1110 a manor record shows that men who were not wanted for ploughing were required to \\"thresh in the Great Barn until sunset\\". A granary was recorded in a survey conducted in 1293–4 and a further survey of 1324 recorded the existence of a monastic grange in addition to the granary. The wheat barn at Harmondsworth was damaged in a storm in 1398 and records from Winchester College show that two carpenters were sent to make repairs, for which a large quantity of tiles, nails and other roofing materials was purchased. By this time, however, the existing barn was evidently becoming inadequate. The college's records indicate that in 1426–7 it commissioned two men, William Kypping (or Kipping) and John atte Oke, to obtain timbers from Kingston upon Thames to use for a new barn at Harmondsworth. This date matches an early fifteenth-century origin for the Great Barn's timbers, which has been established through dendrochronology. The architect is not known, but it is possible that William Wyse may have been involved. He was the main carpenter for New College, Oxford and the master carpenter at Windsor Castle in 1430, and worked on repairing the aisles at the church of St Mary's in Harmondsworth, practically next door to the manor. Carpenters from Ickenham and Uxbridge were also involved and a tiler appears to have been employed by the college at the same time. Once completed, the barn would have been used to thresh and store grain from the manor farm. In 1544, the manor was taken by King Henry VIII to add to his hunting estate around Hampton Court but he does not appear to have used it, and shortly afterwards he granted it to the Paget family. It remained in their hands until 1869. During the first half of the 20th century the manor was owned by the Ashby family. The last Ashby to farm there died in 1948 and the farm was sold in 1950 to Peter Purser, who died in the late 1970s. It was already a Scheduled Monument and was given Grade I listed building status in March 1950 when new heritage protection legislation was brought into force. The barn continued to be used for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It had a couple of narrow escapes during the 20th century; during the Second World War a German V-1 flying bomb flattened a nearby barn, but only managed to dislodge a few roof tiles on the Great Barn. The barn's southern bay was seriously damaged by fire in 1972 but it was subsequently restored. The building was greatly admired by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, who dubbed it \\"the cathedral of Middlesex\\". It underwent a detailed eighteen-month survey in the late 1980s by the craftsman Peter McCurdy (who later went on to rebuild Shakespeare's Globe theatre), supported by the Museum of London. Neglect and rescue The barn and the surrounding Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed to restore the barn to serve as a showcase for the company. The farm underwent major changes, with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing the barn. Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn, following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through. The receiver offered the barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company had no other assets and it was reported that it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) raised the alarm in a 2009 edition of its magazine, Cornerstone, in which the deteriorating condition of the barn was highlighted as the magazine's cover story. The magazine reported that on a recent visit \\"more than a dozen gaps in the tiled roof were seen, some large. The site appeared to lack fire-fighting equipment or alarms, and could be easily accessed. Plants have taken root in the stone-and-brick plinth, and have begun to damage the medieval blocks upon which the barn stands.\\" English Heritage issued a statement saying: \\"The absentee owner of the barn has declined to engage with English Heritage (and the local authority) for some years despite our offers of help, support, advice and grants. The Heathrow expansion area would surround the site of the barn on three sides but would not, according to plans we have seen, propose its demolition or removal. However, this still leaves question marks over the barn’s future and in particular, the issues of viability and setting.\\" Following the publication of the Cornerstone article, English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the compulsory purchase of the barn. It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections. The repairs mainly involved fixing holes in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water, as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides. The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £30,000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012. In January 2012, a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £20,000. By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company. Simon Thurley, the Chief Executive of English Heritage, called the barn \\"one of the greatest medieval buildings in Britain, built by the same skilled carpenters who worked on our magnificent medieval cathedrals. Its rescue is at the heart of what English Heritage does.\\" The local Member of Parliament, John McDonnell, praised the hard work of local people and English Heritage staff and said that he was \\"now overjoyed that we have secured this wonderful building for future generations.\\" The SPAB also welcomed the decision, calling the barn one of the \\"symbols of the dominance of the rural economy in the past, and the immense investment in craftsmanship and materials that agriculture deserved.\\" Reopening and future management The barn is managed by volunteers from the Friends of the Great Barn at Harmondsworth, a local preservation group, acting on behalf of the owners, English Heritage. It is open to the public for free on the second and fourth Sunday of each month between April and October.

It later served as the residence of several high-ranking members of the Chakri Dynasty until 1900 when the palace became the site of the Royal Thai Naval Academy. The palace is now within the grounds of the Royal Thai Navy headquarters in Bangkok, and is open for group visits pending advance appointment. History The Royal Thai Navy headquarters building, originally built for the Royal Thai Naval Academy and later modified with a Thai-style roof, sits on the grounds of the former palace Following the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 and subsequent Burmese withdrawal, the military leader Phraya Tak succeeded in reclaiming the cities of Ayutthaya and Thonburi (also known as Bangkok). He then established himself as king (later known as Taksin) and made Thonburi his new capital. He had a royal palace built within the old city walls, near the Wichayen Fort (which was renamed Wichai Prasit) on the western bank of the Chao Phraya River. The palace lay to the south of Wat Chaeng (now Wat Arun) and northeast of Wat Thai Talat (Wat Molilokkayaram), both Buddhist temples which were included within the palace grounds. Taksin's reign ended in 1782 when he was overthrown by the general Chao Phraya Chakri, who became king (later known as Phutthayotfa Chulalok). Phutthayotfa Chulalok relocated the capital city proper to the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya (Rattanakosin) and had a new royal palace, the Grand Palace, built there. Taksin's palace then became known as Phra Racha Wang Derm, or former palace, and the two royal temples were excluded from the palace grounds. As Thonburi was still strategically important, guarding Rattanakosin against invasions from the west, the king would place important royal family members, mostly their sons or brothers, at the palace. This tradition continued until the death of Prince Chaturonrasmi in 1900. King Chulalongkorn subsequently granted ownership of the palace to the Royal Thai Navy, and the palace became the site of the Royal Thai Naval Academy until its relocation in 1944. The palace is now within the grounds of the Royal Thai Navy headquarters and is jointly managed by the Phra Racha Wang Derm Restoration Foundation. In contrast with the Grand Palace, Phra Racha Wang Derm is much smaller and simpler in its construction. Apart from the older Wichai Prasit Fort, the only original building from the Thonburi period is the Throne Hall, a Thai-style building consisting of two segments forming a T shape. Later additions include two Chinese-style residences, King Pinklao's residence, King Taksin's shrine, the Whale Head Shrine, and the (literal) Green House.

It is the largest non- university research center for Latin American Studies outside of Latin America. It also features the largest specialized library in Europe on Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the Caribbean. In addition to a large rare book collection, the IAI collects and preserves magazines, electronic documents, maps, audio media, photographs, videos, DVDs, papers and diverse additional materials.about the IAIretrieved 1/29/2012 The IAI is a member of the Research Association CEISAL () and the documentation network association REDIAL. Founded in 1930, since 1962 the IAI has been an agency of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It is located at the Kulturforum near Potsdamer Platz in Berlin-Mitte. History The Neuer Marstall, original home of the IAI until World War II Part of the IAI collection in 1958 The Institute was founded in 1930 and on a core of three large book collections. In the late 1920s, the Argentine scholar Ernesto Quesada had given his approximately 82,000-volume private library to the State of Prussia. In addition, it received the Mexico library of geographer Hermann Hagen, who had collected 25,000 volumes with the support of Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles. When Institute for Latin America Studies in Hamburg closed in 1930, its inventory of approximately 10,000 volumes was then transferred the IAI. Thus by the time of its founding, the IAI was already in possession of about 120,000 volumes, a specialized and comprehensive collection that included many rare and valuable books. Apart from the library, an essential element of IAI was the research department. Both were initially housed in the Prussian Royal Stables building (), a grand edifice in central Berlin-Mitte. Under the direction of Wilhelm Faupel, the Nazi envoy to rebel General Francisco Franco, the Institute became integrally involved in diplomatic relations between the Third Reich, Spain and Argentina. During World War II it was moved to Berlin- Lankwitz and the books sent into storage to protect them from Allied bombing. An estimated at 40,000 volumes were lost during the war.Reinhard Liehr/Günther Maihold/Günther Vollmer (eds.): Ein Institut und sein General: Wilhelm Faupel und das Iberoamerikanische Institut in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (Frankfurt, 2003) After the war, as a result of its Nazi activities, the institute was nearly dissolved. On 1 April 1946, the West Berlin City Government took over the financing of the IAI and thus saved it. In that same year the Institute was named the \\"Latin American Library\\", and in 1954 it was renamed the \\"Ibero-American library\\". In 1957 the library came under the auspices of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. In 1962 the institution was again named the \\"Ibero-American Institute.\\" In the following years one of its main tasks was to close the gaps in the collection lost during the War. Here the IAI received great support by foreign institutions, libraries and other facilities. In 1977, the IAI moved into a new building on the Kulturforum at Potsdamer Straße 37. Structure and Function Today, the IAI is composed of: *The Library Department *The Department of Research, Special Collections and Projects *The Department of Central Services. The IAI also publishes monographs and periodicals, for example the magazine Ibero-analysis with topics on the politics, economy, society and culture of the South American countries. In Ibero-Online.de appear lectures held at the IAI which can be downloaded in PDF format. Bibliographies from the IAI holdings on certain topics and numerous publications are also available online. Library Collection *Sound Archives: media including 15,000 LPs; 2,000 singles; 1,000 shellac discs; 4,500 CDs; 900 music cassettes and 1200 tapes. *Map Collection: Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula and former Spanish and Portuguese colonies, comprising an estimated 68,550 printed and 80 hand-drawn maps and 1348 atlases. *Picture Archive: The collection began in 1973 and contains approximately 60,000 photographs and 22,000 slides. *Newspapers: Articles about Spain, Portugal, Latin America and the Caribbean have been collected since the founding of the IAI in 1930. The collection includes an estimated 300,000 clippings. In 1990, the collections of the GDR Institute for International Politics and Economics and the German Institute for Contemporary History (DIZ) of the GDR were added. This includes approximately 76,000 newspaper clippings from the international press. Following digitization, no physical clippings have been collected since 1999. *Estate Collection: Includes the legacies of anthropologist Eduard Seler, archaeologist Max Uhle, and photographer Ernst Hugo Brehme. There are also special collections, for example, a graphic collection of Taller de Gráfica Popular and an extensive collection of the Brazilian Literatura de Cordel.

This framework can be used to optimize some characteristics of multiple cooperating agents in mathematical optimization problems. More specifically, due to its nature in which both individual and cooperation objectives are optimize, MCACEA is used in multi- objective optimization problems. Description and implementation MCACEA, uses multiple EAs (one per each agent) that evolve their own populations to find the best solution for its associated problem according to their individual and cooperation constraints and objective indexes. Each EA is an optimization problem that runs in parallel and that exchanges some information with the others during its evaluation step. This information is needed to let each EA to measure the coordination objectives of the solutions encoded in its own population, taking into account the possible optimal solutions of the remaining populations of the other EAs. With this purpose, each single EA receives information related to the best solutions of the remaining ones before evaluating the cooperative objectives of each possible solution of its own population. As the cooperation objective values depend on the best solutions of the other populations and the optimality of a solution depends both on the individual and cooperation objectives, it is not really possible to select and send the best solution of each planner to the others. However, MCACEA divides the evaluation step inside each EA in three parts: In the first part, the EAs identify the best solution considering only its individual objective values and send it to the others EAs; in the second part, the cooperation objective values of all solutions are calculated taking into account the received information; and in the third part, the EAs calculate the fitness of the solutions considering all the individual and cooperation objective values. Although each population can only offer a unique optimal solution, each EA maintains a pareto set of optimal solutions and selects the unique optimal solution at the end, when the last population has already been obtained. Therefore, to be able to determine a unique optimal solution according with the individual objectives in each generation (and so, using it with the MCACEA framework), a step in charge of selecting the final optimal solution must also be included in the evaluation step of each EA. Evaluation phase in MCACEA The complete evaluation phase of the individual cooperating EAs is divided in six steps. When searching for the solution of a single EA, only the first two steps of this new evaluation process are used. MCACEA extends this process from these two only steps to the next six: 1\\\\. Evaluating the individual objectives of each solution. 2\\\\. Calculating the fitness of each solution with the single evaluation function (containing only the individual objectives). 3\\\\. Finding the best solution of the population. 4\\\\. Sending (and receiving) the best solution to (of) the other single EAs. 5\\\\. Calculating the cooperation objectives taking into account the received information from the other EAs. 6\\\\. Calculating the fitness of each solution with the complete evaluation function (containing both the individual and the cooperation objectives), which have been obtained in steps 1 and 5. Similar approaches Although MCACEA may look similar to the habitual parallelization of EAs, in this case, instead of distributing the solutions of the whole problem between different EAs that share their solutions periodically, the algorithm is dividing the problem into smaller problems that are solved simultaneously by each EA taking into account the solutions of the part of the problems that the other EAs are obtaining. Another possibility,C. Zheng, L. Li, F. Xu, F. Sun, and M. Ding, Evolutionary route planner for unmanned air vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 609–620, Aug. 2005. is to send the best completely evaluated solutions of the previous generation to the other EAs instead of our current best only individual objective evaluated one. Nevertheless, that approach introduces a bias toward outdated completely evaluated trajectories, while MCACEA does it toward currently good individual objective evaluated ones. Applications MCACEA has been used for finding and optimizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) trajectories when flying simultaneously in the same scenario.J. M. de la Cruz, E.

It is usually diagnosed in early childhood and is characterized by the triad of proportionate short stature with delayed bone age, characteristic facial appearance, and delayed speech development. Although its cause is unknown, it is thought to result from genetic mutation, and diagnosis is established by the presence of a heterozygous SRCAP mutation in those with clinical findings of FHS. Signs and symptoms Below are the common clinical features of those diagnosed with Floating–Harbor syndrome. Patients will show varying degrees of some or all FHS symptoms. Facial abnormalities are the most defining aspects of those diagnosed with this disease. = Cardinal facial features = *Triangular face *Deep-set eyes *Short philtrum *Wide mouth with a thin vermilion border of the upper lip *Long nose with a narrow bridge and broad, bulbous base *Low-set ears = Voice quality and language = *Dysarthria and verbal dyspraxia with phoneme imprecision *Hypernasality *High-pitched voices *Severe receptive and expressive language impairment across all domains of function = Bodily features = *Significant delay in bone age (-2 SD or greater) with normalization between 6–12 years old *Skeletal anomalies: brachydactyly, broad fingertips or clubbing, clinodactyly, short thumbs, prominent joints, clavicle abnormalities *Short adult stature: for females, maximum height was at the 20th percentile; for males, the maximum height was at the 25th percentile, though male height varied more widely The differential diagnosis of broad thumbs includes Rubinstein-taybi syndrome, where they are a cardinal feature. FHS is also in the differential, which logically agrees with the thought that the disease is a result of a mutation in SRCAP, as this gene interacts with CBP. = Behavior = *Tantrums during infancy *Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during school years: impulsivity, inattention, restlessness *Unpredictable, aggressive outbursts *Autistic spectrum disorder (one case) *Asperger syndrome (one case) *Obsessive compulsive disorder (two cases) = Other observations = *Intellectual disability: in all cases each individual showed a varying degree of intellectual impairment and learning disability, ranging from borderline normal to moderate intellectual disability *Early entry into puberty is shown in some girls, leading to menorrhagia and irregular periods *Dental problems (caries, malocclusion, dysplastic, small teeth) *Visual impairment Mechanism The cause of this condition is unknown but evidence of familial inheritance and sporadic genetic mutation has been linked to cases of FHS. Two possibly familial cases have been reported—one in a mother and son, and the other in a mother and daughter. This suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance but additional cases need to be investigated to establish this. Another report has suggested that the inheritance may be autosomal recessive. In all of these cases, however, the mothers and children were not similarly affected, suggesting a variable clinical expression of the syndrome. In a study published by the American Journal of Human Genetics in 2012, exome sequencing was used to investigate a group of unrelated individuals with classic features of FHS and identified heterozygous mutations in SRCAP as causative of this disorder. Each reported mutation was truncating (nonsense or frameshift) and occurred between codons 2,407 and 2,517 in exon 34, resulting in the loss of three C-terminal AT-hook motifs. SRCAP encodes a SNF2-related chromatin-remodeling ATPase that is a coactivator for CREB-binding protein (or CBP), which is the major cause of Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome. This disrupted interaction between the proteins most likely explains the clinical overlap between FHS and RTS. *SRCAP has been shown to transduce signals of nuclear (steroid) hormone receptors and Notch pathways, showing that it plays diverse roles in gene expression. *SRCAP contains several functional domains (SNF2 like ATPase, an N-terminal HSA domain, and three C-terminal AT-hook DNA- binding motifs). *The CBP interaction domain of SRCAP is located centrally. Thus, the mechanism of disease in FHS is suspected to be dominant-negative (or antimorphic) due to the mutation in the final exon that results in the loss of the major transactivation function of SRCAP (or loss of one or more critical domains). All of the patients that carried the mutation also had obvious physical symptoms (i.e., prominent nose, delayed bone age, and short stature). Those who tested negative for the mutation often had dysmorphic facial features distinct from classical FHS, as well as a formal diagnosis of autism. = Drawbacks to findings = From the same group, three individuals whose phenotype most closely resembled FHS carried no mutation on the SRCAP gene. Though these findings are a large step in determining the underlying cause of FHS and widely accepted, others would claim molecular diagnosis is not always successful and the mutation is not a mandatory feature for the diagnosis of FHS. Diagnosis Until recently, doctors have diagnosed patients with FHS based on clinical observations and how well they fit the disease description, usually occurring in early childhood. Molecular genetic testing is also used now to test for genetic mutations. By performing a sequence analysis test of select exons, mutations can be detected in exon 34 of the SRCAP gene. This mutation has been observed in 19 patients to date. In most cases, if the patient shows classic facial features of FHS, the molecular testing will show a mutation on the SRCAP gene. =Differential diagnosis= FHS shares some common features with Rubinstein–Taybi (due to overlapping effects of mutations on SRCAP), however cranial and hand anomalies are distinctive: broad thumbs, narrow palate, and microcephaly are absent in Floating-Harbor Syndrome. One child in the UK has a diagnosis of microcephaly alongside Floating–Harbor syndrome.http://floatingharborsyndrome.co.uk/associated- difficultiesdisorders/microcephaly/ Management There are no cures for FHS. Close monitoring of growth in the first few years is essential, as well as annual general health screening and tests listed below. An FHS diagnosis will affect the individual and those there to support them. Managing symptoms and features of FHS involves maintaining a close watch on the patient's physical as well as mental health. This would include: * Sequencing of SRCAP exons 31–34 in all suspected cases * Complete assessments of auditory and visual systems * Renal and urinary tract ultrasound * Orthopedic assessment of hip dysplasia and clavicle abnormalities * Neurologic assessment if there is a suspicion of seizures * Dental hygiene to prevent cavities and to monitor for malocclusion * Evaluation for growth hormone deficiency at baseline, to be repeated if loss of growth velocity occurs * Monitoring of bone age and pubertal timing in case of precocious puberty * Psychoeducational assessments corrected for deficiencies in expressive language and sensory issues * Monitoring of behavioral disturbances and provision of early intervention * Counseling for families regarding recurrence risk and the offspring of individuals with FHS Special education programs and vocational training to address developmental disabilities are highly recommended, as well as communication rehabilitation with sign language or alternative means of communication. Behavior management strategies could also include referrals to behavior specialists or psychologists for help. For those concerned, genetic counseling can be sought for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives. History The first identified instances occurred in 1973 at the Boston Floating Hospital, and in 1975 at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance, California. The name Floating–Harbor syndrome was coined by Robinson et al. in 1988. Since then approximately 40 more cases have been described. The first case recorded was that of a 5-year-old boy. In a 32-year follow up done in 2006, the patient was in good overall health, had never been hospitalized, and had been employed for the past 15 years. His mother stated he had a very good memory, was gregarious, had a temper, and at times was stubborn. Changes in the patient's facial configuration and body could be attributed to age and familial history (i.e., the patient shows signs of arthritis and hypertension). Still present were the low hairline, broad tip of the nose, short nasal labial distance, depressed columella, thin lips, and posteriorly positioned ears, as well as short stature and mild to moderate retardation. Recent research In a study published in 2012 in the Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology, a group of scientists reported the long-term effects of a patient diagnosed with FHS undergoing growth hormone therapy from the age of 3.5 years to 9 years old. While the GH seemed to work initially, the patient's growth after the first couple years slowed significantly and the patient reached a stable height far below the target or standard height. The results on GH therapy remain inconclusive. Recent research mostly centers around the search and confirmation of the gene responsible for FHS. As discussed in the mechanisms section, though the mutation of SRCAP is a widely accepted indicator of a patient diagnosed with FHS, it is not the cause in every case.

One of the journalists who suffered through the ordeal later told: “They beat us silently. After that, one of them said they were going to shoot us now. But then with a snicker he added, ‘It’s a pity we didn’t bring silencers’ and then they left.” The attackers stole video equipment, documents, cell phones, and personal items from Orlov and the journalists. An hour before the attack the patrol squad that was keeping watch in the Assa Hotel left their post under orders from their superiors. The car with the hostages was not stopped once along the way. Oleg Orlov and the other victims are convinced they were attacked by officers of special services and that the attack itself was “an act of intimidation.”Journalists of REN TV Consider that in Ingushetia they were Attacked by Employees of Special Services, November 27, 2007 According to the facts of the attack a court case was drawn up under three articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (UKRF): “hindrance of lawful professional work of journalists” (item 144, part 1 UKRF), “illegal penetration into a dwelling with application of violence” (item 139, part 2 UKRF), and “theft – open plunder of another’s property” (item 161, part 1 UKRF). A group of well-known Russian human rights activists appealed to the Human Rights Commissioner in Russia, Vladimir Lukin, and to Ella Pamfilova, the Chairman of the President of the Russian Federation's council for the development of civil society and human rights institutions. In their appeal they pointed out the inaccuracy in the particulars of the court case: “The investigators ‘did not make note’ that ‘kidnapping’ (item 126), ‘threat by murder’ (item 119), ‘assault’ (item 116), and ‘deliberate harm to health’ (item 112) took place. A one-and-a-half hour run wearing only socks in freezing cold weather is already a sufficient basis to begin speaking of inhuman treatment to victims. Finally, ‘plunder of property with application of violence’ is not qualified as ‘theft’, but as ‘robbery’ (item 162 UKRF).”Human Rights Activists about Abduction of Colleague and Journalists of REN TV, November 26, 2007  Kadyrov’s Lawsuit  In 2009 Orlov placed blame for the murder of “Memorial” employee Natalia Estemirova, which took place in July 2009, on the head of the President of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. In response to this, Kadyrov filed suit against Orlov and HRC “Memorial” in order to protect his honor, dignity, business reputation, and to receive compensation for moral injury. On October 6, 2009 the judge partly satisfied Kadyrov's claim, collecting 20 thousand Rubles from Orlov and 50 thousand Rubles from “Memorial.”the Ombudsman of the Chechen Republic Considers Verdict Too Soft in Court Concerning Orlov.

RIA Novosti News Agency (October 6, 2009). Checked on August 14, 2010 Orlov specified that he did not mean that Kadyrov himself had directly participated in the crime, but that he was responsible for what was happening in the republic. Orlov pointed out that the head of the Chechen Republic had created such conditions as to make it impossible for human rights activists to work in the republic; and what's more—they (human rights activists) are declared as “permitted targets.” The Commissioner of Human Rights in the Chechen Republic—Nurdi Nukhazhiev—announced that Orlov “got off easy.” According to Nukhazhiev, “He (Orlov), in his biased statements, has publicly disgraced the honor, dignity, and business reputation … of Kadyrov. And in such situations the judge should be more severe.” On June 6, 2010, for that same public statement, Orlov was accused of a criminal offense for “slander” (item 129, part 3 UKRF).Orlov found guilty of \\"slander,\\" Interfax, on July 6, 2010 Orlov's court process began on September 13, 2010. Genry Markovich Reznik became his lawyer. The state accuser asked that Orlov be found guilty and fined 150 thousand rubles. The representative of Kadyrov demanded a punishment of 3 years imprisonment. On June 14, 2011 magistrate of the court district No.363 of the Khamoviki region of Moscow declared Orlov “not guilty.” Kadyrov's representative, as well as the state prosecutor, has appealed against this verdict. The consideration of appeals still continues today.

The Institute was founded in 1979 as a department of the Berlin State Museums, overseen by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. The Institute also operates the Center for Provenance Research, tasked with the identification and proper return of looted art from the Nazi period. Additionally, the Institute assists regional museums in the German States. Research projects are carried out in cooperation with experts from relevant scientific disciplines in social sciences, education, engineering and natural sciences. Center for Provenance Research The Center for Provenance Research and Investigation () supports museums, libraries, archives and other publicly run institutions in the Federal Republic of Germany in the various processes of identifying cultural artifacts in their collections or in their possession which were looted from their lawful owners during the Nazi period. The Office was established in 2007 as the direct result of findings issued by the working group on matters of restitution set up by the Minister of State for Culture, Bernd Neumann BKM press release 14.11.2007. Provisions for the Office have been made possible through financial support from the Cultural Foundation of the German States (). Funds totaling a million euros are assigned each year from the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media to support the investigation and study of the provenance of cultural artifacts. An Advisory Council made up of individuals from political and cultural institutions, as well as experts from the fields of history and art history, makes a significant contribution to the outcome of the decision as to which applicants are to receive restitution. The Office also works closely with the Koordinierungsstelle für Kulturgutverluste (www.lostart.de) in publishing its findings and searching for the lawful owners of art works. It is also the aim of the Office to further ongoing ties between those individuals and institutions active in the field of provenance research and to encourage the sharing of information and research knowledge. In October 2014 the German Federal Government announced the reformation of the Koordinierungsstelle’s Lost Art Database into a new foundation called the Deutsches Zentrum Kulturgutverluste (English: “German Center for Lost Cultural Assets”), which will put the Lost Art Database, the Arbeitsstelle für Provenienzforschung (English: “Center for Provenance Research”) in Berlin, the Taskforce of the Munich artworks discovery, and the Research Center for Degenerate Art of the Free University of Berlin under one roof.

Philemon Embel OBE (born 10 October 1962) is a Papua New Guinean politician. He was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 1987 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2012, representing the electorate of Nipa- Kutubu. He has held several positions within the government in PNG, including in the Ministry of Health, Mining, Transport and Civil Aviation. He was awarded an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000. Embel acted as Minister for Sports and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in former Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare's cabinet, until Prime Minister Peter O'Neill took control of the government in late 2011. In September 2010, Embel was physically attacked in his electorate of Poroma, in the Southern Highlands Province during Independence Day celebrations. He was on crutches for three months as a result of injuries sustained during the attack. Involvement in PNG Sports As Minister for Sports, in April 2011, Embel donated K40,000 to the PNG football squad to fund their training activities ahead of their departure to the FIFA U20 World Cup qualifier in New Zealand. . Embel is the Chairman of the Pacific Islands Rugby League Federation (PIRLF), the governing body of rugby league in the South Pacific. Embel campaigned strongly for PNG to enter the National Rugby League (NRL) by 2020, seeking the support of former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and NRL bosses. According to Embel, the PNG NRL Bid was a \\"project of national importance\\", particularly for PNG's youth. However, in December 2011, Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said that the NRL Bid Board and CEO Brad Tassell had decided that PNG would not be added to the competition, citing that the Bid was a waste of public money Controversies In 2009, the Waigani Committal Court committed Embel to stand trial in the National Court over the misappropriation of K165,000 in 2006. This money was provided by the Southern Highlands Provincial Government for the construction of a new church. Embel has sought to overturn the ruling and filed a Judicial Review in August 2011 at the National Court in Waigani, asking it to review the decision of the Committal Court. In December 2011, Embel was accused by Minister of Planning Sam Basil of having received K51 million from the National Government from 2005 to 2011. Embel said that he did not know anything about this K51 million, and that he was aware of money going into his district treasury but did not know the purpose of these funds. He called on Basil to check why so much money was being pumped into his district without Embel's knowledge. In December 2011, Embel was also accused by Markham MP Koni Iguan of being responsible for K1.2 million of \\"missing\\" public funds, from K20 million allocated by the Somare government for the PNG NRL Bid. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said he was aware of the missing money and was being urged to act through the Executive National Council to stop funds being accessed. In April 2012, Embel admitted to physically assaulting a parliamentary staff member during an argument about his unpaid travel entitlements.

A second live-action film, 1-Ichi, was directed by Masahito Tanno and released in Japan in 2003. Plot Using Ichi as a tool, Jii-san plots to kill Anjougumi's Kumichou (leader) and steal his money. With Anjou's death, Anjou's top yakuza, Kakihara, sets out to find his Kumichou's murderer. While Kakihara searches for Ichi, Ichi effortlessly kills off remaining members of the Anjougumi. This continuous cycle of killing and searching leads the two closer together revealing Ichi's psychological manipulation and Kakihara's obsession of pain and torture. When the two finally meet, the two confront their deepest and suppressed desires resulting in Ichi's psychological recovery and Kakihara's demise. Characters *Ichi (Shiroishi Hajime) is the main character in the series. He is psychologically and emotionally disturbed to the point where he acts as a child living in an adult's body. When faced with a confrontation, Ichi bursts into tears and breaks down emotionally. Even with his cowardly personality, Ichi has trained extensively in the martial arts. With this training, a concealed blade in his left boot, and a psychological kill switch, Ichi turns into a ruthless killer hunting down yakuza with a streak for sadism. *Kakihara Masao is a yakuza boss and Ichi's prime enemy. He is tired of everything in life and lives to inflict pain on others and even himself. His most notable characteristics are the deep gashes on his cheeks. These gashes allow him to open his mouth to ridiculous levels in a snake like fashion and they are subsequently held together by piercings. He lives his life for sadomasochism. *Jii-san (Old Geezer) is the mastermind behind the unrest in the Anjougumi family as well as the puppet master making Ichi kill. He claims to have gained his aged features through plastic surgery and to still be in his early thirties. Has an extremely muscular physique and abuses steroids. *Anjou Yoshio (Kumichou) is the head of the Anjougumi yakuza family. His murder, which is first disguised as a disappearance, leads Kakihara to search for Ichi. *Noboru is a member of Jii-san's group whose weapon is a firearm. *Inoue (Kanou) is an excommunicated member of the Anjougumi and a current member of Jii-san's group. He is also a heroin addict that has undergone plastic surgery to remain hidden in Shinjuku. *Suzuki is a member of the Funaki yakuza family. He is accused of kidnapping Anjougumi's Kumichou. He is bedridden by the resulting torture and is convinced by Jii-san's group to employ them to eliminate Kakiharagumi. *Kaneko is Anjougumi's hitman and one of Kakihara's closest henchmen. He exhibits a fear similar to Ichi's and desires to prove himself. He is also Takeshi's father. *Norio is a young boy who goes to the same martial arts dojo as Ichi. He constantly gets beat up and goes to Ichi for help. *Seila is a prostitute that Ichi frequently visits. She has many bruises that are inflicted by her pimp, leading Ichi to have flashbacks of his past. *Karen is a hostess and one of Kakihara's friends. She assists Kakihara in locating members of Jii-san's group. *Tachibana is a girl from Ichi's first year in high school. When trying to save Ichi from bullies, she was ostracized and raped. *Long is a Chinese member of Jii-san's group that works as a gigolo. *The twins (Jirou and Saburou) are members of Kakihara's former Kumichou Atougumi. They are as competitive as they are sadistic, often resulting in shows of one-upmanship fatal to others. Jirou has inhuman strength, while Saburou is good with a short knife. *Takeshi is Kaneko's son and often witnesses Ichi crying after his murders. He is also Ichi's successor as the next \\"killing machine\\" manipulated by Jiji. Media =Manga= The manga has been compiled into ten volumes by Shogakukan. There is also a prequel titled Ichi. =Films= The manga has been adapted into a film of the same name directed by Takashi Miike and the prequel into a film called 1-Ichi by Masato Tanno. =Anime= The manga has also been adapted into an OAV called Koroshiya 1: The Animation Episode 0. Reception Reviewing the OAV, Theron Martin from Anime News Network felt that the story is \\"perfectly believable\\" and \\"convince[s] the viewer that Ichi's lethal tendencies didn't come from nowhere\\" because it follows the \\"common elements you hear about in the backgrounds of true killers\\".

Relaxin-3 is a member and ancestral gene of the relaxin family of peptides, which includes the namesake hormone relaxin (designated 'H2 relaxin' in humans) which mediates peripheral actions during pregnancy and which was found to relax the pelvic ligament in guinea pigs almost a century ago. The cognate receptor for relaxin-3 is the G-protein coupled receptor RXFP3 (relaxin family peptide 3 receptor), however relaxin-3 is pharmacologically able to also cross react with RXFP1 and RXFP3 (although the physiological relevance of such interactions, if they exist endogenously, are currently unknown). Structure Relaxin-3 consists of 51 amino acids in humans which are arranged into a two-chain structure (designated the A-chain and B-chain). There are three disulfide bonds (two interchain, one intrachain), with the residues that mediate binding to/activation of RXFP3 residing within the B-chain. At translation, pro-relaxin-3 also contains a C-chain (in between the A and B-chains) which is removed via protolytic cleavage to form the mature neuropeptide. Distribution Relaxin-3 is mostly expressed within neurons of the brain, where it is packaged into dense cored vesicles and trafficked along axons where it can be detected in presynaptic vesicles before release onto target neurons, characteristic of a neurotransmitter. The largest number of relaxin-3-positive neurons in the rodent brain are within a region of the pontine brainstem known as the nucleus incertus, while smaller populations are present within the pontine raphe, periaqueductal grey, and an area dorsal to the substantia nigra. From these centres, relaxin-3 innervates a broad range of brain regions which are also rich in RXFP3 mRNA/binding sites, including the extended limbic system and the septohippocampal pathway. Function The broad distribution of relaxin-3 fibres/RXFP3 within several key neuronal circuits suggests an ability to modulate a broad range of behaviours. This has been confirmed in a growing number of rodent studies, which demonstrate relaxin-3 is able to modulate arousal, the response to stress, feeding/metabolism and memory; and likely plays a role in the generation/regulation of hippocampal theta rhythm. Relevance to human disease Neuropeptides such as relaxin-3 are attracting increasing interest as targets for the pharmacological treatment of a range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Due to the ability of relaxin-3 to modulate neuronal processes/behaviours such as mood, stress responses and cognition, which are often aberrant in mental illnesses, considerable potential exists for the development of relaxin-3-based drugs to therapeutically treat depression and other mental illnesses.

The walkway links Riversley Park and the George Eliot Memorial Gardens. The 'Gold Belt' was produced as a result of a project between local artist Alisha Miller, Warwickshire County Council and Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council in 2003. The 'Gold Belt' represents a coal miner's leather belt. This reinforces a local connection through Nuneaton's mining heritage and also links to the Union Wool and Leather Factory that used to be located on the site of a supermarket close to Riversley Park. The work was inspired by the motto, \\"a good reputation is better than a belt of gold\\", of Edward Melly who donated the park to the people of Nuneaton in 1907.  The Project  With financial support from the Countryside Agency and the Local Authorities, a project developed allowing for research into the local area, community workshops and reminiscence activities. The research included identifying a spot suitable and meaningful for the sculpture. The bridge was identified as a space that could be transformed through having public artwork. The workshops involved local children and students and were held at Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery. Historical talks were given and the participants worked with Miller to produce artwork of local scenes. Some of these local scenes are featured on the belt, along with drawings produced by Miller of other local public artwork and features. A reminiscence session was held at Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery, sharing photographs and memories with the older community members. These memories were collected and featured alongside the images on the belt. The work was unveiled by the mayor of Nuneaton, Ian Lloyd, on 11 October 2003.

Zaboly (May 1910 – April 1985), a.k.a. Bill Zaboly, was an American cartoonist best known for his work on Thimble Theatre with Popeye. Zaboly's illustrated signature used the initials BZ with the \\"B\\" formed by the wings of a bee.Potrzebie In headings for Thimble Theatre, his typeset credit line was given as Bill Zaboly rather than Bela Zaboly.  Biography  Born in Cleveland, Zaboly drew for his school paper in high school. After graduation, he was employed in the art department of the Cleveland-based syndicate, Newspaper Enterprise Association, where he started as an office boy and eventually was a staff cartoonist. =Early strips= As an illustrator, printmaker and painter, he exhibited in Cleveland and Chicago during the early 1930s, also creating the Sunday strip Otto Honk about moon-faced, dim-bulb Otto, who was variously employed as a private eye, movie stunt man and football player. Zaboly discontinued this strip in 1936. He was an assistant to Roy Crane on Wash Tubbs, and from 1936 to 1938 he drew Our Boarding House after Gene Ahern left NEA to do Room and Board for King Features Syndicate.Zaboly entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed Dec. 13, 2018.Grandinetti, Fred M. Popeye: An Illustrated Cultural History, McFarland, 2004. Zaboly, his wife Irene and their son lived at 13609 Drexmore Road in Cleveland. =Popeye= After Popeye creator E. C. Segar died in 1938, Thimble Theatre was scripted by Tom Sims. Doc Winner (1884–1956), who worked in the King Features bullpen, illustrated the strip until Zaboly took over in 1939. Zaboly and Sims produced the daily strip until 1954, and they worked on the Sunday strip until 1959. Ralph Stein began writing the daily in December 1954 with Zaboly as artist. Bud Sagendorf took control of both the daily and Sunday in 1958, although his work was not published until August (daily) and September (Sunday) of 1959. Zaboly also continued Segar's Sappo topper strip. Zaboly made certain changes in the strip, notably replacing Swee'pea's nightgown with a small sailor suit, by the request of King Features. This change allowed Swee'pea to walk during the years 1957 to 1959. Sagendorf returned the character to his original appearance. Zaboly's art was featured in several Popeye coloring books from the late 1950s through 1964 and in other licensed items during this period. These items included Popeye's Presto Paints (Kenner, 1961) and Popeye's Color and Re-Color Book (Jack Built-Toys, 1957) which used all of Zaboly's art. The last Thimble Theatre daily by Zaboly was published August 8, 1959, with his Sunday strips continuing for a few months after that. With his Thimble Theater run ending, Zaboly returned to Cleveland, went back to work for NEA and also was an art salesman for the Alan Junkins Studio in Cleveland's Caxton building. He later attempted to launch his own syndicate without success. =Death= He died in 1985, aged 75.

Initiated in 1997 by the Materials Laboratory of the Department of Condensed Matter Physics at the University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain, the Bilbao Crystallographic Server is developed and maintained by academics.http://www.cryst.ehu.es/html/doc/bcs_about.html About the Bilbao Crystallographic Server and its authors. Information on contents and an overview of tools hosted Focusing on crystallographic data and applications of the group theory in solid state physics, the server is built on a core of databases and contains different shells. =Space Groups Retrieval Tools= The set of databases includes data from International Tables of Crystallography, Vol. A: Space-Group Symmetry, and the data of maximal subgroups of space groups as listed in International Tables of Crystallography, Vol. A1: Symmetry relations between space groups. A k-vector database with Brillouin zone figures and classification tables of the k-vectors for space groups is also available via the KVEC tool. =Magnetic Space Groups= In 2011, the Magnetic Space Groups data compiled from H.T. Stokes & B.J. Campbell'shttp://stokes.byu.edu/magneticspacegroups.html Table of Magnetic Space Groups. and D. Litvin'shttp://www.bk.psu.edu/faculty/litvin/Download.html Magnetic Groups.'s works general positions/symmetry operations and Wyckoff positions for different settings, along with systematic absence rules have also been incorporated into the server and a new shell has been dedicated to the related tools (MGENPOS, MWYCKPOS, MAGNEXT). =Group-Subgroup Relations of Space Groups= This shell contains applications which are essential for problems involving group-subgroup relations between space groups. Given the space group types of G and H and their index, the program SUBGROUPGRAPH provides graphs of maximal subgroups for a group-subgroup pair G > H, all the different subgroups H and their distribution into conjugacy classes. The Wyckoff position splitting rules for a group-subgroup pair are calculated by the program WYCKSPLIT. =Representation Theory Applications= The fourth shell includes programs on representation theory of space and point groups. REPRES constructs little group and full group irreducible representations for a given space group and a k-vector; CORREL deals with the correlations between the irreducible representations of group-subgroup related space groups. The program POINT lists character tables of crystallographic point groups, Kronecker multiplication tables of their irreducible representations and further useful symmetry information. =Solid State Theory Applications= This shell is related to solid state physics and structural chemistry. The program PSEUDO performs an evaluation of the pseudosymmetry of a given structure with respect to supergroups of its space group. AMPLIMODES performs the symmetry-mode analysis of any distorted structure of displacive type. The analysis consists in decomposing the symmetry-breaking distortion present in the distorted structure into contributions from different symmetry-adapted modes. Given the high and low symmetry structures, the program calculates the amplitudes and polarization vectors of the distortion modes of different symmetry frozen in the structure. The program SAM calculates symmetry-adapted modes for the centre of the Brillouin zone and classifies them according to their infrared and Raman activity. NEUTRON computes the phonon extinction rules in inelastic neutron scattering. Its results are also relevant for diffuse-scattering experiments. =Structure Utilities= A set of structure utilities has been included for various applications such as: the transformation of unit cells (CELLTRAN) or complete structures (TRANSTRU); strain tensor calculation (STRAIN); assignment of Wyckoff Positions (WPASSIGN); equivalent descriptions of a given structure (EQUIVSTRU); comparison of different structures with support for the affine normalizers of monoclinic space groups. STRUCTURE RELATIONS calculates the possible transformation matrices for a given pair of group-subgroup related structures. =Incommensurate Crystal Structures Database= The Bilbao Crystallographic Server also hosts the B-IncStrDB: Bilbao Incommensurate Crystal Structures Database, a database for incommensurately modulated and composite structures.

Afterwards, in collaboration with Harold T. Stokes and Dorian M. Hatch from Brigham Young University, USA, the server extended its services to include symmetry modes analysis. Asen K. Kirov, a Ph.D. student from Sofia University, Bulgaria contributed to the server, working on programs dedicated to irreducible representations and extinction rules. In 2001, Ph.D. student Cesar Capillas began his research on the server and became the main developer and system administrator focusing on structure relations, such as pseudosymmetry and phase transitions. Danel Orobengoa, also a Ph.D. student, joined the developer team in 2005 and worked mainly on symmetry modes, k-vector classification tables and non- characteristic orbits (in collaboration with Massimo Nespolo of the Nancy- Université, France), writing his Ph.D. thesis on the applications of the server for ferroic materials. In 2009, Ph.D. student Gemma de la Flor and post-doc Emre S. Tasci were recruited for the development team: de la Flor working mainly on the identification and interpretation of symmetry operations, structure comparison and Tasci becoming the new system administrator and main developer, focusing in the structure relations concerning phase transitions.

Recent scholarship suggests that the earthquake was part of a multiple earthquake stretching from Damascus to the south, to Antioch in the north and to Mosul in the east.

The 847 earthquake has also been linked to movement on this fault. Other earthquakes in 847 A.D. A number of other towns and cities in the Middle East also suffered major destruction in 847 A.D., probably on the same day (24 November). The earthquake in Antioch may have been the same one which destroyed much of Damascus, Syria on 24 November 847. The Damascus earthquake began around dawn, lasting until at least midday; part of the Umayyad (Great) Mosque was destroyed and its minaret fell down. Bridges and houses collapsed, and huge stones were displaced. Other towns near Damascus were destroyed including Darayya. There was destruction in towns in Homs (Syria), in Lebanon, and also in the region of Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia.

The term was coined by George Streeter (Latin for \\"uncertain nucleus\\") based on its unknown function at the time, to name a group of cells he observed near the midline of the floor of the 4th ventricle. The nucleus incertus is a bilateral structure which sits near the brainstem, and is often also called 'nucleus O'. It consists of mostly ascending GABAergic projection neurons and glutamatergic neurons which innervate a broad range of forebrain regions involved in behavioural activation and the response to stress. This tegmental nucleus is part of the theta network. The nucleus incertus is a relay from the reticularis pontis oralis nucleus to the septo-hippocampal system. The stimulation of the nucleus incertus activates the hippocampal theta rhythm and either its lesion or inhibition suppress the theta oscillation induced by brainstem stimulation. The nucleus incertus itself presents theta oscillations coupled to the hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition to hippocampal theta rhythms, a recent study in rodents implicates the nucleus incertus in the control of locomotor speed and arousal.

Mriya cultivated approximately 165,000 hectares of land in Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Lviv, and Rivne regions. The Agro Holding grew wheat, potatoes, rapeseed, corn, sunflower, soybeans, barley, and sorghum. In August 2014, the company failed to pay its creditors and announced a technical default. Starting February 2015, control over the company's assets was transferred to the creditors, primarily European and American investors who decided to preserve the Agro Holding and to appoint a new management team. New management consisted of General Director Simon Cherniavsky, CFO Ton Huls, and COO Victor Kuharchuk. In September 2018, Mriya was acquaired by Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Co.  History  =1992–1995: Early years= Mriya was founded on April 17, 1992 by Ivan and Klavdiya Guta. The company began as a farming research and production enterprise and received land from the State Reserve Fund of Ternopil region. The total arable land amounted to 50 hectares. In 1994, the company expands its land bank to 150 ha and begins cooperation with American experts in order to acquire its first international experience in agriculture. In 1995, the company implements advanced potato cultivation technologies and in the same year upgrades potato storage facilities located in Vasylkivtsi village, Ternopil region.

It is canonically the sequel to the 1998 film Rasen. Plot A mysterious, white-clad man drops a long-haired woman into a well. The well is full of women, all with long hair, all dressed in night- dresses. Thirteen years after the original film, two suicides prompt Detective Koiso and his partner to investigate a string of mysterious deaths. The deaths involve video played on devices; just before the deaths, a voice says, \\"You're not the one.\\" While Koiso is unconvinced, his partner deduces that the deaths are the result of a cursed video that online artist Seiji Kashiwada created. Akane Ayukawa, teacher of a schoolgirl who died, discovers the schoolgirl's best friend Risa had been looking into the cursed video. The video had been deleted, but the Error 404 message in its wake prompts the video to play when the viewer is alone. In it, Kashiwada allows himself to be killed by a long- haired woman. When the video ends, Risa is attacked; Akane arrives just in time to save her. The ghost tells Akane that she is \\"the one.\\" Akane screams, and the computer is destroyed. Meanwhile, Koiso and his partner scout Kashiwada's apartment, noting the furniture and decorative wallpaper, which look like a set. The landlady notes that everything is superficial. Akane is a telekinetic who displayed her power years ago when a maniac attacked her high school. Though she saved the school, she was branded a freak. Takanori Andō, son of Mitsuo Andō from the previous film, and a boy who appreciates her abilities, grows up to be her boyfriend. She soon realizes the video is targeted at her when, at their home, the video plays and the woman appears. Multiple screens show the woman attacking. Takanori and Akane run to a street, where they believe themselves safe, but a large LCD display truck shows a giant version of the ghost, who snatches Takanori away. Until his partner commits suicide in front of him, Detective Koiso continues to doubt the existence of the film, even when it is revealed that the original broadcast of the online video killed its initial viewers and employees of the site where it was uploaded. Koiso makes his way to Kashiwada's apartment, eager to find answers. He discovers the wallpaper is a horde of white butterflies hiding notes and history. Kashiwada had been attempting to resurrect Sadako Yamamura, as revenge against the human populace for persecuting him. He initially kidnapped long-haired women and threw them down the well, alive. However, when it was revealed that a body could not be found that way, he orchestrated the \\"cursed video\\" so that the video would find the perfect host for her. Koiso finds Akane, whom he'd interrogated previously, and the two of them journey to the old Yamamura household. It no longer has the inn, and a \\"new\\" decrepit mall was beside the well. However, upon approach to the well, a freakish- looking Sadako facsimile appears and attacks Koiso, biting his neck. The women that had been thrown into the well had become imperfect versions of Sadako. They attack Akane, but with stealth and resistance, Akane prevails against the imperfect Sadakos. When she arrives at the center of the derelict building, she discovers Takanori had been trapped in a mobile phone at the center of the room. A legion of imperfect Sadakos arrive, but her fear triggers her telekinetic powers, which decimates them. Akane is transported to the roof where the \\"real\\" Sadako has been waiting. Sadako says they are exactly the same, which Akane denies; Sadako uses her powers to destroy, while she helps people. Seeing Takanori with a knife to his throat, Akane trades herself for his life. Sadako agrees and goes into her. Akane is overlain with a large amount of the ghost's hair and is buried inside it. Takanori, now free from Sadako's thrall, destroys the phone. The roof gives and Akane drops to the floor below covered in Sadako's hair. However, she escapes alive. In a mid- credits scene, It was shown that just outside the building beside the well, Kashiwada's landlord moves away and her words, \\"Isn't it all artificial?\\" echo. In the post-credits scene, the intro to Kashiwada's video plays again. However, his introduction changes. \\"Here we go again.\\" Cast * Satomi Ishihara as Akane Ayukawa * Koji Seto as Takanori Ando * Yusuke Yamamoto as Seiji Kashiwada * Ryosei Tayama as Detective Koiso * Ai Hashimoto as Sadako Yamamura Sequel In late 2012, it was announced that a sequel to Sadako 3D would be made, titled Sadako 3D 2.

The urban freight system can include seaports, airports, manufacturing facilities, and warehouse/distribution centers that are connected by a network of railroads, rail yards, pipelines, highways, and roadways that enable goods to get to their destinations. Urban freight distribution is essential to supporting international and domestic trade as well as the daily needs of local businesses and consumers. In addition, it provides thousands of jobs and other economic benefits. However, a number of challenges are associated with urban freight, such as road congestion, environmental impacts, and land use conflicts due to the proximity of freight facilities and vehicles to residential and sensitive land uses. As urban freight continues to grow, the community and environmental impacts associated with these challenges will need to be addressed and mitigated.  Description and evolution One of the main drivers of urban freight transport has been the continued urbanization of the world's population. According to the United Nations (UN), 3.9 billion people (54%) of the world's population lives in urban areas, up from 746 million in 1950. Projections indicate that urbanization combined with the overall growth of the world's population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban populations by 2050, or 66% of the total world population. The UN notes that the number of mega-cities of ten million or more inhabitants has increased from ten in 1990 to 28 in 2014. By 2030, the world is expected to have 41 mega-cities. As the total number and concentration of the world's population in urban areas has grown, so has the importance of transporting and delivering the consumer goods required to sustain these urban areas. This includes freight transportation to and from warehouse/distribution centers, retail stores, businesses, and homes. Urban freight distribution also involves transportation from freight-generating facilities such as seaports, airports, railyards, manufacturing facilities, and warehouse/distribution centers, many of which are located in urban areas and utilize an urban region's roadway and railway network to transport goods. In addition, many companies today use sophisticated computerized logistics systems to manage their supply chains and employ just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing and delivery to minimize inventory and expenses. While JIT can significantly reduce production costs, it also requires efficient and reliable transportation systems, both within and between urban regions, to be effective. At the local or neighborhood level, the growth of E-commerce and small package delivery by firms such as FedEx and UPS means that cities and communities should consider the needs of truck circulation and parking/loading zones within residential and commercial areas to facilitate delivery of goods. Complicating urban freight is the need of the transportation system to also accommodate other roadway users such as automobiles, public transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. For example, cities are increasingly implementing road diets to enhance and encourage walking, bicycling, livability, and pedestrian safety. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), it is possible for road diets to accommodate freight movement if factors such as current land use, truck size, delivery parking areas, and intersection design are considered in the planning process.  Components  Urban freight distribution can include the following components, depending on the location of the urban area: = Seaports = Seaports allow ships to dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Seaports handle a variety of goods including cargo shipped by intermodal containers, bulk commodities such as crude oil, and specialized cargo such as automobiles. Major container ports in North America include the Port of Los Angeles, Port of Long Beach, Port of New York and New Jersey, Port of Savannah, Port of Vancouver, Port of Oakland, Port of Virginia, Port of Houston, Port of Tacoma, Port of Charleston, and Port of Seattle. = Airports = Airports, and more specifically air cargo, are a significant component of the freight system. It is estimated that in the United States in 2013, over $1.1 billion worth of goods traveled by air. The top five airports in the U.S., ranked by landed weight of all-cargo operations in 2014, are Memphis International Airport, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, Louisville International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and Miami International Airport. =Warehouses and distribution centers= A distribution center is a warehouse or other specialized building that receives, stores, and distributes goods to a variety of destinations such as retail stores, businesses, consumers, manufacturing facilities, or other distribution centers. =Railways and railyards= Railroads haul a variety of goods such as intermodal containers, bulk goods, and other specialized cargo such as automobiles. In the United States, railroads are most commonly used to transport cargo over distances of 1,000 to 2,000 miles. Railroads are complemented by rail yards that allow freight from shippers to be trucked in, transferred onto railcars, and for trains to be assembled. There are three railroad classes in the United States: Class I, II, and III. According to the Association of American Railroads, Class I railroads had a minimum carrier operating revenue of $433.2 million in 2011. There are seven Class I railroads in the United States: BNSF Railway, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, CSX Transportation, Kansas City Southern Railway, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad. =Roads= In the United States, trucks transport the vast majority of goods in terms of both weight and value. In fact, trucks transport 85% of goods traveling 249 miles or less. To transport their goods, trucks utilize the roadway network consisting of freeways, highways, and arterials. The roads that trucks can travel on are regulated at the national, state, and local levels. In the United States the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 established a National Network of highways that permits \\"conventional combination\\" trucks (tractors with one semitrailer up to 48 feet in length or with one 28-foot semitrailer and one 28-foot trailer, and can be up to 102 inches wide) to travel on. The National Network consists of the Interstate Highway System as well as non-interstate highways designated by states. The FHWA also designates intermodal connectors and the National Highway Freight Network, which consists of the Primary Highway Freight System (PHFS), portions of the interstate system not part of the PHFS, Critical Rural Freight Corridors (CRFC), and Critical Urban Freight Corridors (CUFC). At the local level, many cities designate truck routes within their respective jurisdictions. In most jurisdictions, trucks are allowed to use most streets as needed for local deliveries. However, local jurisdictions can restrict \\"through\\" truck trips that pass through a jurisdiction but do not end or begin there. For these \\"through\\" truck trips, trucks can be required to travel on designated truck routes and remain on the designated truck route for as long of the trip as possible. Designated truck routes enable cities to channelize trucks onto roadways that have sufficient lane and intersection width, and in some cases pavement strength, to accommodate trucks. In addition, designated truck routes can be used to direct trucks onto arterials in industrial and commercial areas and away from residential areas, schools, parks, and other sensitive land uses. Many local jurisdictions also designate curbside truck parking and loading zones. The purpose of truck parking and loading zones is to provide adequate space for trucks to load and unload their goods, and prevent illegal and double parking by trucks. Cities provide guidelines for locating parking and loading zones and often allow businesses to apply to establish a new parking and loading zone. Cities can also regulate the type of truck and length of time that trucks can park in a parking or loading zone and establish fines for violations.  Benefits  The efficient and timely distribution of freight is critical for supporting the demands of modern urban areas. Without freight distribution, urban areas could not survive, grow, and flourish. Freight distribution also generates significant economic benefits. For example, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) estimates that in 2012, the freight industry (defined as rail, water, truck, and pipeline transportation, support activities for transportation, couriers and messengers, and warehousing and storage) employed over 4.3 million people and paid total wages of almost $184 billion, for an average wage of over $42,000US annually. Furthermore, for-hire transportation services contributed $481 billion to U.S. gross domestic product in 2013.  Challenges  There are a number of challenges resulting from urban freight distribution, including traffic congestion, environmental impacts, and land use conflicts. * The use of older trucks that emit a higher amount of emissions and have fewer safety features relative to newer trucks. * The prevalent use of diesel fuel in the goods movement industry generates NOx and PM2.5 emissions that can have significant air quality impacts. * Insufficient or inadequate truck parking and/or loading zones can result in illegal truck double parking, parking in bicycle lanes, or parking in center median lanes. * Conflicts between trucks and automobiles, pedestrians, and bicyclists can occur in dense urban areas due to high vehicle volume, inadequate arterial capacity, inadequate intersection turning radii for trucks, and/or the increasing implementation of \\"Complete Street\\" elements such as bicycle lanes. These conflicts can result in congestion, parking, and safety impacts. * The use of modern, longer trucks, particularly in highly dense urban areas or older industrial areas with inadequate intersection width can result in turning movement conflicts between trucks and other roadway users that can increase congestion, have safety impacts, and damage curbs, sidewalks, traffic signals, and signs. * Within urban areas, the length and frequency of freight trains have resulted in growing congestion, noise, air quality, and safety impacts at at-grade crossings where trains and roads intersect. As a result, local jurisdictions have taken the initiative to construct road/rail grade separations to eliminate these conflicts. Notable examples include the Alameda Corridor Alameda Corridor and Alameda Corridor East Alameda Corridor East programs in southern California, and the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE).Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) * Land use conflicts can arise when goods movement facilities are located in close proximity to non-industrial land uses such as schools, residences, and parks. These conflicts can result in noise, air quality, and congestion impacts that may require significant mitigation measures. For example, the proposed Southern California International Gateway railyard that would be operated by the BNSF Railway just north of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach would provide mobility and environmental benefits by enabling more intermodal containers to travel via rail instead of truck. However, the project has also generated protests and a lawsuit due to the proximity of the proposed facility to residential neighborhoods in West Long Beach, California. These issues affect not only the efficiency of freight distribution but also the quality of life of citizens and public health.  Policy and planning  In the United States, urban freight policy and planning is conducted at the federal, state, regional, and local levels. At the federal level, freight planning and policy is guided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST) that establishes the National Multimodal Freight Policy and National Freight Strategic Plan. In addition, the FHWA Office of Freight Management and Operations conducts freight research, develops analytical tools and data, and organizes freight professional development programs. At the state level, state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are primarily responsible for planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining the highway system within the state. As part of the FAST Act, states were given additional roles and responsibilities for freight planning. States are now required to establish a State freight advisory committee as well as develop a comprehensive State freight plan. Freight planning at the regional level is conducted by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). MPOs are required in urbanized areas with a population greater than 50,000 and are mandated by the federal government to develop plans for transportation, growth management, hazardous waste management and air quality. An MPO must have a \\"continuing, cooperative and comprehensive\\" (3C) transportation planning process that results in plans and programs consistent with the comprehensively planned development of its corresponding urbanized area. The two primary roles of an MPO are to prepare the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The RTP presents a 20-year transportation vision for the region and provides a long-term investment framework for addressing the region's transportation and related challenges. The RTP addresses all modes of transportation including highway and transit projects, as well as high-speed regional transport. Projects must be included in the RTP to be eligible for state and federal funding. The TIP is a listing of proposed transportation projects to be funded through a variety of federal, state and local sources over the next six years in the respective region. In addition, some MPOs convene freight advisory committees that bring together public and private sector representatives to plan for freight in the region. One example is the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission Goods Movement Task Force. Counties and local cities are primarily responsible for design, construction, and maintenance of the local roadway network within a county or city. This includes capacity enhancements, pavement maintenance, sidewalks, street lighting, signals, and signage. From a freight perspective, cities also designate local truck routes, Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) terminal access routes, and parking and loading zones. In some cases, counties also collect and allocate locally generated tax revenue for transportation projects.  Strategies  A variety of strategies exist and have been proposed or implemented by governments and private industry that help address the challenges of urban freight distribution. The range of strategies includes infrastructure, operational, technological, and policy: =Infrastructure= * Construction of dedicated truck lanes or truck climbing lanes to reduce congestion and improve safety * Physical infrastructure improvements such as lane or intersection widening to reduce conflicts between trucks and other users of the roadway * Construction of road/rail grade separations to remove conflicts between freight trains and vehicular traffic * Increased investment in highway, rail, and transit infrastructure maintenance that will result in significant congestion, safety, and economic benefits. Currently, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that $170 billion in capital investment would be needed on an annual basis to significantly improve conditions and performance. =Operational= * Designating truck routes and truck parking/loading zones to better facilitate goods movementand reduce conflicts * Inland distribution centers to reduce congestion in dense urban areas * Extended business operating hours to allow night-time delivery of goods =Technological= * The use of information and communication technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicle routing software or load sharing systems, etc. to maximize the efficiency of truck travel and minimize truck-miles of travel (TMT). ITS will introduce many opportunities for best management and control of urban freight distribution, with an informative system that will inform the driver about the real-time traffic conditions to help the driver to schedule its trips. * Computerized marine terminal and/or warehouse appointment systems to better manage the flow of trucks. * Use of lower sulfur diesel fuel, newer diesel engines, and alternative fuel trucks (natural gas, hybrid, electric) to reduce environmental impacts. For example, the Clean Air Action Plan being implemented by the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach includes a Clean Truck Program to introduce newer and/or alternative fuel trucks for drayage.http://www.cleanairactionplan.org =Policy= * Restricting truck delivery to off-peak hours to minimize congestion and maximize use of existing infrastructure * Financial assistance, fees, and taxes (e.g., cordon pricing, congestion charges, area licensing, etc., as in London, Stockholm and Milan) * Truck weight or size restrictions, as appropriate =Land use/facility design= * Better land use planning to locate freight facilities away from residential neighborhoods or in a manner that minimizes conflicts with adjacent land uses * Improved freight facility design so as to reduce the impacts of those facilities to the surrounding community. This could include sufficient onsite truck parking and loading docks, landscaping, building materials, lighting design to reduce light impacts, buffer zones, and noise control policies and/or procedures. * Provision of truck parking and/or loading zones to facilitate local delivery of goods  Refrigerated freight  Consumers enjoy a best quality of life due to economic and societal changes, which imply several modifications in consumption. In fact, they can afford to consume more perishable products for example. Apart from that, the government has developed policies of \\"security of quality\\" and the regulation, obligating to add new products that need to be transported in refrigerated vehicles to the existing list. It is also obligatory to control the temperature of those vehicles during the delivery. Societal and legal requirements have obliged suppliers and transport companies to resort more frequently to the refrigerated urban freight distribution. The use of refrigerated transportation improved the quality of the service provided but it also implies high negative impacts for the urban environment and citizens' quality of life. The traditional system of refrigeration consumes more combustible, so it increases the CO2 emissions. Noise due to the refrigeration system and the type of combustible used can also be a problem in urban zones.EFRUD website = Technology used = Most of the food that needs to be refrigerated is transported by road through the use of vehicles equipped with an isolated structure. Many factors are evaluated during the design of the units for refrigerated food transportation, for example: * The weather conditions * The indoor climatic conditions * The properties of the insulation system that will be used * The possible infiltration of air and moisture, etc. The refrigeration system used to transport food is based on vapor compression that ensures the maintenance of certain conditions such as temperature in function of the quantity and type of food transported. The units that use this technique can work at full thus allowing controlled transport of refrigerated loads. = Energy consumption and environmental impact = The energetic efficiency of the refrigerated boxes of the modes of transport has more importance depending on the region of the world. The rise in combustible prices and the environment evolution are other aspects that companies need to take into account. The combustible consumption depends on the refrigerated system which has to be in relation with the kind of goods transported (refrigerated products as fruit and vegetables can travel at a 0 °C temperature and frozen products need a temperature lower than 20 °C). The contamination is due to a combination of factors such as the pattern use of the refrigeration system, the type of product transported, the exposition to the sun, the density of the refrigerant, the setting of the control system such as modulation and the activation/deactivation of the compressor. In some cases, energy consumption for the distribution of fresh food can be higher than for the transportation of frozen food, because of stricter controls in terms of product and because it breath more air to keep the uniform temperature during the distribution. = Transport through a passive-cooling system = According to a study (A. Ghirardi, 2003), the exportation and the distribution of fruit and vegetables are affected by the high cost of the environmental impact. The systems and technologies currently used are expensive, not compatible with the environment and not sustainable. The transit time is a central aspect in export operations, and it has to take into account multiple factors, even imponderable as the quality of the product at destination. The passive refrigeration system allow to solve the problem of quality preserving, making the time of surrender compatible with the combined transport and independent of the energy source during the running, allowing also the use modes of transport without electrical connection. An examination of the critical factors of refrigerated transport and characteristics of the passive refrigeration system emerges a synergy capable of solving the key aspects, and in particular: * Coefficient of deterioration of the products obtained from the combination of factors such temperature, relative humidity and ventilation. These parameters are maintained in optimal conditions in the vehicle equipped with a passive refrigeration system that guarantee a longer life for the product that it transport compared to the traditional refrigeration mechanisms. * Competitive costs for the transport For distribution in urban areas, the saturation of the traffic and the propensity of cities to limit the flow of vehicles for goods distribution require the optimization of the logistics and distribution chain. This optimization is realizable by employing passive-cooling container units that are independent of loading and transport and allow the use of the same mode, also non- refrigerated, for the distribution using only one mode to deliver its order to the stores, keeping the products at an optimum temperatures and consistent with autonomy.

The dotted purple line shows the route of Colonel Sturgis. The Nez Perce in Yellowstone Park was the flight of the Nez Perce Indians through Yellowstone National Park between August 20 and Sept 7, during the Nez Perce War in 1877. As the U.S. army pursued the Nez Perce through the park, a number of hostile and sometimes deadly encounters between park visitors and the Indians occurred. Eventually, the army's pursuit forced the Nez Perce off the Yellowstone plateau and into forces arrayed to capture or destroy them when they emerged from the mountains of Yellowstone onto the valley of Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone River. Background In June 1877, several bands of the Nez Perce, numbering about 750 men, women, and children and resisting relocation from their native lands on the Wallowa River in northeast Oregon to a reservation in west-central Idaho on the Clearwater river, attempted to escape to the east through Idaho, Montana and Wyoming over the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains. By late August, the Nez Perce had travelled hundreds of miles and fought several battles in which they defeated or held off the U.S. army forces pursuing them. The Nez Perce had the mistaken notion that after crossing the next mountain range or defeating the latest army sent to oppose them they would find a peaceful new home. The Nez Perce leader Chief Joseph in 1877. The Nez Perce War was extensively reported in the nation's press. The fighting retreat of the Nez Perce had made their leader Chief Joseph something of a national hero and a military genius in the eyes of many in the American public. On Aug 9, 1877 the Nez Perce engaged the U.S. Army under the command of Colonel John Gibbon at the Battle of the Big Hole near the headwaters of the West fork of the Big Hole River in Montana. By all accounts, this battle was a draw with heavy casualties on both sides, but the Nez Perce escaped to the south and into Idaho. General Oliver O. Howard's force, just a day's ride to the west from the Big Hole encounter, pursued the Nez Perce into Idaho. The Army was embarrassed by its failure to defeat the Nez Perce. =Into the Yellowstone= On August 20, 1877 the Nez Perce and the U.S. Army engaged again at the Battle of Camas Creek just west of Henrys Lake, Idaho. The Nez Perce raided a camp of soldiers, stealing mostly mules and a few horses and supplies. The ensuing fight lasted a full day, but resulted in few casualties. On the evening of the 20th, the Nez Perce headed east, crossed Red Rock Pass leaving Idaho into Montana then entering Yellowstone National Park and Wyoming near the present-day west entrance on August 23, 1877. General Howard's Bannock scouts and White scout Stanton G. Fisher followed the Nez Perce a day behind. They reported back to Howard and he predicted correctly that the Nez Perce's objective was to cross the Yellowstone plateau and then head for the Crow agency on the Yellowstone River. Howard's command was exhausted and did not immediately pursue the Nez Perce into the park, electing to remain in the vicinity of Henry's Lake to regroup. While Howard with 600 men took up the pursuit of the Nez Perce again on August 27, after resting his soldiers for four days at Henrys Lake, his superior, General William Tecumseh Sherman, was laying a trap for the Nez Perce when they emerged from Yellowstone Park. Lt. Gustavus C. Doane and about 100 men plus Crow scouts was dispatched to guard the north entrance of Yellowstone Park at Mammoth Hot Springs. Colonel Samuel D. Sturgis and 360 men would guard the Clarks Fork on the east. Major Hart with 250 cavalry and 100 Indian scouts was to guard the Shoshone River exit also on the east. To the south, Colonel Wesley Merritt with 500 men was positioned on the Wind River. To the North at Fort Keogh in Montana, Colonel Nelson Miles was standing by with a force of several hundred soldiers. Against 2,000 soldiers plus hundreds of Indian scouts, the Nez Perce fighting men probably numbered fewer than 200. Poker Joe, one-half White and fluent in English, was their guide through Yellowstone. Their leadership was collective, drawn from each of the five bands of the tribe represented among the refugees. Looking Glass was probably the most influential war leader. Although Chief Joseph is credited with being the overall leader of the Nez Perce, his role was more focused on the management of the camp of women and children than fighting. The chiefs attempted to restrain their young men from taking revenge on White non- combatants, but not always with success. Hostile encounters with tourists and prospectors Sign detailing the encounter of the Nez Perce with the Cowan party When the Nez Perce entered Yellowstone there were eight or nine parties of tourists totaling at least 35 persons in the park, plus several groups of prospectors. Two of these parties would experience hostile encounters with elements of the Nez Perce. The Radersburg Party as they became known, nine tourists from Radersburg, Montana had been in the park on August 23, 1877 for eight days. Made up of George F. and Emma Cowan, Emma's brother and sister, Frank and Ida Carpenter, Charles Mann and Henry Meyers, this group also included A.J. Arnold, William Dingee and Albert Oldham from Helena, Montana. They were camped just west of the Lower Geyser Basin. General Sherman himself had been in the park as a tourist only a few days before. His scout reportedly assured members of the Radersburg party that they would be perfectly safe from the Nez Perce. However, one of the tourists, Emma Cowan, noted that the Sherman party \\"preferred being elsewhere, as they left...that same night.\\" A second group of tourists, made up of entirely young men became known as the Helena party. On the evening the August 23, Andrew Weikert, Richard Dietrich, Charles Kenck, Frederick Pfister, Jack Stewart, Leonard Duncan, Joseph Roberts, August Foller, Leslie Wilke and an African American cook named Benjamin Stone were in camp at Yellowstone Falls. Not far from the Radersburg party were John Shively, a lone prospector, James Irwin, a recently discharged soldier, and a dishevelled lone tourist encountered on the Yellowstone river near Mount Washburn was \\"Texas Jack\\" (John Omohondro), a scout with a small party of English tourists. =Encounter with the Radersburg party= After entering the park, the band of Nez Perce moved up the Madison and Firehole Rivers to the Lower Geyser Basin near Fountain Flats. A small scouting party of Nez Perce led by Yellow Wolf led the way. In the late afternoon of August 23, Yellow Wolf's scouts captured John Shively at the confluence of the East Fork of the Firehole River (Nez Perce Creek) and the Firehole River. They forced him to act as a guide for the Nez Perce through Yellowstone. On the morning of August 24, Yellow Wolf's scouting party rode into the Radersburg party camp and forced the group to accompany them up the Mary Mountain trail east toward the Yellowstone River to the main Nez Perce camp. By noon, upon the advice of Poker Joe, the Nez Perce chiefs decided to allow the party to leave and head west out of the park, but only on the condition that they abandon all their supplies and horses to the Nez Perce, which they did. About 30 minutes after they were released and on their way west down the edges of the Mary Mountain trail, the party encountered a group of 20-30 Nez Perce stragglers who wanted to return the tourists into the hands of the chiefs. Shooting erupted, George Cowan was shot point blank in the head and Albert Oldham suffered a painful face wound. The remainder of the party was unhurt and scattered into the forest to the north. Upon learning of the encounter, a Nez Perce chief came to the rescue of several of the tourists. Frank Carpenter, Ida Carpenter and Emma Cowan were returned to the Nez Perce camp and given the protection of Chief Joseph. On August 25, the Nez Perce continued east to Trout Creek on the Yellowstone river in what is today known as Hayden Valley. By late afternoon on the 25th, the Nez Perce has crossed the Yellowstone near Mud Volcano at what became known as Nez Perce Ford. During the day Nez Perce scouts encountered James Irwin hiding in a ravine and brought him into their camp as well. On the evening of August 25, the Nez Perce released the Carpenters, and Emma Cowan giving them two horses. They safely made their way north where they found protection from elements of Lt. Doane's 2nd cavalry near Mount Washburn. James Irwin and John Shively remained as guides for the Nez Perce. Over the next couple of days, other members of the Radersburg party made their way out of the park via the Madison River and into the safety of General Howard's forces at Henry's Lake. On August 30, Howard's forces, moving up the Madison river, found George Cowan and Albert Oldham alive, but in poor condition. =Encounter with the Helena party= Unfortunately for the members of the Helena party, James Irwin had disclosed the location of their camp near the forks of Otter Creek while in the hands of the Nez Perce. At dawn on August 26, a Nez Perce war party found the Helena party's camp. Two of the members Weikert and Wilke had already left the camp. The Nez Perce attacked the camp with gunfire. Charles Kenck was shot dead. John Stewart was wounded in the leg and captured by the Nez Perce. The other members of the party, including Richard Dietrich, scattered into the forest. Stewart bribed his release from the Nez Perce with $263 and a silver watch. After cleaning his wounds, he made his way north out of the park. When Weikert and Wilke return to camp, they discovered the raid and immediately headed north out of the park. They also had a brief encounter with the Nez Perce war party, and Weikert sustained a shoulder wound. On August 27, the main Nez Perce force moved further east up Pelican Creek from the tourists and the army. Also on the 27th, Weikert who had already reached Mammoth Hot Springs headed south to search for Dietrich and the other members of the Helena party. By the end of the day, Dietrich and Ben Stone were safe at McCartney's Hotel and bath house at Mammoth Hot Springs. James McCartney and Weikert agreed to go back to Otter Creek to locate Kenck, Stewart and the others. =The burning of Henderson's ranch= Richard Dietrich was killed in one of these buildings that made up McCartney's Hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs (ca 1871) The Henderson ranch must have looked much like this in 1877. Photo of the Bottler ranch (just a few miles north of Hendersons) (ca 1871) Unbeknownst to Weikert and McCartney as they traveled south to Otter Creek, a band of 20-30 Nez Perce were moving north toward Mammoth Hot Springs where Dietrich and Stone were staying. The Indians had already burned Baronett's Bridge (the first bridge across the Yellowstone River near its confluence with the East Fork of the Yellowstone (Lamar River) built by Jack Baronett, a trader and Yellowstone guide in 1871). The Nez Perce found Dietrich and Stone and chased them into the forest where they successfully evaded confrontation with the Indians. On the morning of August 31, the band of Nez Perce moved north of the mouth of the Gardner River and attacked the Henderson Ranch which was a homestead established in 1871 a mile or so north of the park. A two-hour gunfight resulted in no casualties. Sterling Henderson and his hands abandoned the ranch for the safety of the river and the Nez Perce sacked and burned the buildings. Shortly after the attack on the ranch, a force of cavalry under the command of Lt. Doane was moving up the river near Devil's Slide. They quickly engaged the Nez Perce and drove them back into the park. Unfortunately for Dietrich, believing the Nez Perce had left the Mammoth Hot Springs area took refuge in one of McCartney's buildings. As the Nez Perce fled south they found Dietrich and killed him. Wiekert and McCartney had found Charles Kenck's body at Otter Creek and buried him. Upon their return to Mammoth, they found Dietrich dead as well. Fearing that Ben Stone might be dead and Mammoth Hot Springs no longer a safe place, they made their way north into the safety of Lt. Doane's camp, where they found Ben Stone, the negro cook, safe as well. Although there were a few other skirmishes between soldiers and the Nez Perce while the Indians were still in the park, they resulted in only minor casualties. The Nez Perce's escape Sunlight Bridge today spans a canyon that the Nez Perce crossed on horseback. Clarks Fork Canyon. The Nez Perce descended into the Canyon via a narrow defile in the rock walls. The Nez Perce entered Yellowstone National Park on August 23, 1877 near the Madison river. On September 6, 1877 they left the northeast corner of the park via Crandall Creek en route to the Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone. Once inside the park, the Nez Perce knew of three routes by which they could escape, northwest via the Yellowstone River, northeast via Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone or east via the Shoshone River. The Nez Perce, suspecting the Army would be waiting for them at all the usual exits, selected an unknown and most difficult route over the Absaroka Mountains reaching an elevation of nearly . Fisher, following them, said it was \\"the roughest country I ever undertook to pass through. About every foot of it was obstructed with dead and fallen timber and huge blocks of grammar.\\" After Fisher and his group of Bannocks had a skirmish with the rear guard of the Nez Perce, he broke off the chase and turned back to find General Howard and his soldiers. Once the main body of Nez Perce left the Yellowstone river, they moved up Pelican Creek onto the Mirror Plateau. It was there that James Irwin escaped. James Shively escaped a few days later. They continued east crossing the Lamar River and ascending one of the major creeks—Calfee, Miller or Cache. They reached the divide on the evening of September 5, 1877. On the morning of September 6, they continued northeast down Crandall Creek and into the canyon of the Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone. Although his forces had never been very far from the Nez Perce, Howard never engaged the Indians while in the park and chose an easier route to the Clark's Fork. The trap Col. Samuel D. Sturgis. His son had been killed in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. He was out-foxed by the Nez Perce when they emerged from the mountains of Yellowstone Park onto the Great Plains. Howard and his soldiers crossed Yellowstone by a more northerly and easier route and reached the Northeast corner of the Park on Clark's Fork on September 7. From Fisher's scouting, the Army was now aware that the Nez Perce would emerge from the mountains near the Clark's Fork or the Shoshone Rivers. Howard continued on down the Clark's Fork River hoping to trap the Nez Perce between his force and that of Sturgis waiting below. To prevent any news of their location getting to the army during their difficult passage down from the summit of the Absarokas to the Plains the Nez Perce hunted down and killed White prospectors and hunters in the area. Ten men were known to have been killed by the Indians and additional bodies were discovered over the next several months. As other army troops ordered to guard the Yellowstone exits were not yet in place, Sturgis set up his base on the Plains from where he had an expansive view and could move quickly toward either Clark's Fork or to the Shoshone River. He seems to have discounted the Clark's Fork exit, \\"finding that no trail could possibly lead through it.\\" The lower several miles of Clark's Fork passed through a narrow canyon with vertical walls 800 feet high. On September 8, when the Nez Perce reached a point six miles from Sturgis's force on top of a ridge near what is now called Dead Indian Pass, their advance scouts observed the soldiers far below. If the Indians took the open and easy route to reach the Plains, their 2,000 horses and 700 people would be easily visible. Instead they attempted a difficult maneuver to mislead the soldiers. They took a route going south toward the Shoshone River, and then, invisible to army scouts, milled their horses in a big circle to conceal their trail and sell the army on the idea that they were heading south. They then sneaked back north, concealed by heavy timber, and traversed Dead Indian Gulch down to the Clark's Fork River. Dead Indian Gulch was a narrow, steep-sided slit in the rock, dropping almost vertically for 1,000 feet and barely wide enough for two horses to go side-by-side. \\"In a cleanly executed maneuver,\\" said a military historian, \\"the Nez Perce had countered an extremely serious threat and won a brilliant, though temporary respite.\\" Sturgis took the bait and led his soldiers away from the Clark's Fork and headed south to the Shoshone. The Nez Perce passed out onto the plains unopposed. Sturgis quickly realized his error and turned around. He met up with Howard on September 11 who had descended the Clark's Fork following the Nez Perce's route, but the two military forces were now two days and 50 miles behind the Nez Perce. Aftermath Howard ordered Sturgis to take up pursuit of the Nez Perce whose trail led north into Montana. He would catch up with them on September 13 at the indecisive Battle of Canyon Creek. Colonel Miles would later take Chief Joseph's surrender in the Bear Paw Mountains just miles from the Canada–US border on October 5, 1877. George Cowan and Albert Oldham completely recovered from their injuries in Radersburg. Cowan would spend a lot of time in the park in later years telling visitors about his encounter with the Nez Perce. Wiekert and McCartney eventually recovered the bodies of Kenck and Dietrich and both are buried in Helena, Montana. In 1902, Major Hiram M. Chittenden, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Yellowstone's chief road builder embarked on a campaign to mark all the historic spots in the park from the 1877 Nez Perce war. By 1904, with the help of participants George and Emma Cowan and others, signs marked the locations of all the key encounters during the Nez Perce flight through the park. By the 1930s, the signs were all gone. The only memorial today is \\"The Chief Joseph Story\\" roadside marker where Nez Perce Creek crosses the Grand Loop Road. A portion of the route of the Nez Perce is followed today by Wyoming Highway 296 which is named the Chief Joseph Scenic Byway. Sunlight Creek Bridge, Dead Indian Hill and Dead Indian Campground are along the approximate route of the Nez Perce before they feinted a movement to the south to confuse the soldiers on the plain below. =Park features named from the event= * Nez Perce Creek (the East fork of the Firehole river in 1877). Also known as Hayden's fork (1871), east fork of the Madison River (pre-1871) Officially designated Nez Perce Creek in 1885 during the Arnold Hague Geological Surveys of the park. * Nez Perce Ford is the location of Chief Joseph's crossing of the Yellowstone River on August 25, 1877. First named by superintendent Philetus Norris in 1880, the ford has also been known as Chief Joseph's Crossing and Buffalo Ford (1946). * Joseph Peak el. in the Gallatin Range southwest of Electric Peak. Named by members of the Arnold Hague survey in 1885 to honor Chief Joseph's flight through the park. * Cowan Creek, a tributary of Nez Perce Creek about west of the Lower Geyser Basin on the Mary Mountain trail. It was named in honor of George F. Cowan who was wounded by Nez Perce near the mouth of the creek. Chief Park Naturalist, David Condon officially named the creek in 1956. It was formerly known as both Yellowstone Creek and Willow Creek.  References  Further reading *Beal, Merrill D. \\"I Will Fight No More Forever\\" Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce.
