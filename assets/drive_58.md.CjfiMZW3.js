The most senior Marine commissioned officer is the Commandant of the Marine Corps, responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Marine Corps so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified combatant commanders. The Marine Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions: Headquarters Marine Corps, the Operating Forces, the Supporting Establishment, and the Marine Forces Reserve. The Operating Forces are further subdivided into three categories: Marine forces assigned to Unified Combatant Commands, Marine Corps Security Forces guarding naval installations, and Marine Security Guard detachments at American embassies. Under the \\"Forces for Unified Commands\\" memo, Marine forces are assigned to each of the regional unified combatant commands at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense and with the approval of the President. Since 1991, the Marine Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional unified combatant commands. Marine Corps Forces are further divided into Marine Forces Command (consisting of II Marine Expeditionary Force) and Marine Forces Pacific (I Marine Expeditionary Force and III Marine Expeditionary Force). The commander of the former also serves as commanding general for Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, Marine Corps Forces, Europe, Marine Corps Forces, South, Marine Corps Forces, Strategic, and Marine Corps Installations East; while the latter serves as commander of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, Marine Forces Central Command, and Marine Corps Installations West. The Supporting Establishment includes Combat Development Command, Recruit Depots, Marine Corps Logistics Command, Marine Bases & Air Stations, Marine Corps Recruiting Command, and the United States Marine Band. Relationship with other uniformed services Since the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army both believe that their combat capabilities overlap each other, they have both historically viewed the other branch as encroaching on their capabilities and have competed for money, missions, and fame. Most significantly, in the aftermath of World War II, Army efforts to restructure the American defense establishment involved the dissolution of the Marine Corps and the folding of its capabilities into the other services. Leading this movement were such prominent Army officers as General Dwight Eisenhower, who later became the President of the United States, and Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall. Chapter 7, The Marines' Push Button 113-119 The Marine Corps is a branch of the Department of the Navy along with the U.S. Navy. Both the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), heads of their respective services, report directly to the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV). As a result, the Navy and Marine Corps have a close relationship, more so than with other branches of the United States Armed Forces. Recent whitepapers and promotional literature have commonly used the phrase \\"Navy-Marine Corps Team\\". This relationship stems from the Navy providing transport, logistical, medical, and religious service as well as combat support to put Marine units into the fight where they are needed. Conversely, Marines are responsible for conducting land operations to support naval campaigns, including the seizure of naval and air bases. All Marine Aviation programs except for specific command and control and air defense programs are funded by the Navy. Marine Corps officers are assigned to the Office of Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) Air Warfare Branch (N98) to represent Marine Aviation interests and serve as \\"action officers\\" (viz., staff members).http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/plainlanguage/ActionOfficer_StaffWriting.pdf. Action Officer: Staff Writing, Action Officer (Definition), U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, Preface. By Congressional mandate, the OPNAV Director, Expeditionary Warfare Branch (N95) is filled by a Marine general. The Marine Corps cooperates with the Navy on many institutional support services. The corps receives a significant portion of its officers from the United States Naval Academy and Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), which are partially staffed by Marines. Marine Corps drill instructors contribute to training naval officers in Officer Candidate School. Marine aviators are trained in the Naval Aviation training pipeline, and utilize naval-weapons and test-pilot schools. Currently, Navy aircraft carriers deploy with a Marine Hornet squadron alongside Navy squadrons. The Navy's Blue Angels flight team includes at least one Marine pilot and is supported by a Marine C-130 Hercules aircraft and crew. Since the Marines do not train chaplains or medical personnel, officers and enlisted sailors from the Navy fill these roles. Some of these sailors, particularly Hospital Corpsmen, generally wear Marine uniforms emblazoned with the Marine insignia but US Navy name tags in order to be distinct to compatriots but indistinguishable to enemies. The Marines also operate a network security team in conjunction with the Navy. Marines and sailors share the vast majority of branch-specific awards, with Marines earning the Navy Cross, the highest honor awarded short of the Medal of Honor (which Marines also are awarded, in the Navy version of the Medal of Honor), and other like medals; while an example of the few Marine-only awards is the Good Conduct Medal. Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Basic structure of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force Today, the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure that can vary in size. A MAGTF is composed of four elements: the command element (CE), the ground combat element (GCE), the aviation combat element (ACE) and the logistics combat element (LCE). A MAGTF can operate independently or as part of a larger coalition. It is a temporary organization formed for a specific mission and dissolved after completion of that mission. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self- sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time- sensitive situations. The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness towards relying too much on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general. A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest, a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite squadron, up to the largest, a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which ties together a Division, an Air Wing, and a Logistics Group under a MEF Headquarters Group. The three Marine Expeditionary Forces are: * I Marine Expeditionary Force located at Camp Pendleton, California * II Marine Expeditionary Force located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina * III Marine Expeditionary Force located at Camp Courtney, Okinawa, Japan =Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU)= Each of the seven MEUs are assigned to their respective Navy fleet as components of the Fleet Marine Force: three to the Atlantic Fleet (based at Camp Lejeune), and four to the Pacific Fleet (three based at Camp Pendleton and one in Okinawa). Each is commanded by a colonel with a combat arms background thus, infantry or aviator. The MEU components consist of a command element, ground combat element, aviation combat element, and a logistics combat element each commanded by a lieutenant colonel. MEU rotations are staggered so that while one MEU is on deployment, another is training to deploy, and one is standing down to refit and exchange units. Each MEU is trained during its workup evolution to perform special operations tasks and is then designated as a MEU(SOC) (Special Operations Capable). Each MEU can tailor its equipment to the expected tasking. MEU Components: * Command Element * Aviation Combat Element (a composite squadron organized with a variety of platforms) * Ground Combat Element (an infantry battalion, known as the \\"Battalion Landing Team\\", task-organized and reinforced with other organic elements such as armor, artillery, and engineers) * Logistics Combat Element (provides the six functional areas of combat service support to the MEU) Typically, a MEU falls under the operational control of but no longer deploys as part of an Expeditionary Strike Group (which replaced the Amphibious Ready Group), composed of Navy amphibious (\\"L-class\\") ships (a LHD or LHA to serve as the flagship of the Amphibious Squadron, LSD(s), and LPD(s) that embark the MEU), escort ships (such as the , , and an ), and the requisite landing vehicles to transport the MEU ashore, such as the LCAC, LCU surface craft, Amphibious Assault Vehicle (though the MEU can utilize its helicopter lift assets embarked aboard the LHD or LHA). The theater component commander can use the ESG in its entirety or detach units as needed, though the MEU usually remains aboard the ships of the ESG to use it as their principal base of operations. This ability to remain at sea and \\"over the horizon\\" until called is a unique capability of the ESG/MEU. =Ground Combat Elements (GCE)= The basic organization of Marine Corps infantry units follows the \\"rule of threes\\", which places three subordinates under a commander, not counting support elements. The organization and weapons are from the Marine Corps Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) standard. Note that these are principles, but according to manpower and mission needs units can deviate from the TOE (e.g. with four subordinate units instead of three, or a commander who is a rank above or below the rank specified). Supporting units will have their own organization and equipment, but generally also follow the \\"rule of threes\\". *A fire team, is the basic element of the GCE. It consists of four Marines: the team leader, corporal (E-4) (M4/M16 with attached M203), one rifleman, rank of Pvt/E-1 (M4/M16), one assistant automatic rifleman, rank of PFC/E-2 (M4/M16), and one automatic rifleman, rank of LCpl/E-3 (M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle or M249 light machine gun). *A rifle squad, usually led by a sergeant, is made up of three identical fire teams. *A rifle platoon, commanded by a 2nd or 1st lieutenant, consists of three rifle squads, and a headquarters element made up the platoon commander, a platoon sergeant, a platoon guide, and a messenger. (One or more Navy Medical Corpsman are usually attached to the platoon from the battalion's medical platoon.) The platoon sergeant, usually a staff sergeant, advises the commander and serves as the second-in-command. The platoon guide, usually a sergeant, serves as the assistant platoon sergeant. A rifle platoon is capable of integrating attachments from the weapons platoon (e.g., assault squad or machine gun squad) and may include a two-man mortar forward observer team attached from the battalion's 81-mm mortar platoon. :A weapons platoon, usually commanded by a 1st lieutenant and assisted by a gunnery sergeant as the platoon sergeant, will substitute for the rifle squads: :*a 60 mm mortar section, with a staff sergeant as section leader and consisting of three mortar squads, with each squad led by a corporal as squad leader and containing one M224 mortar and three Marines.; :*an assault section, led by a sergeant as section leader and consisting of three assault squads, with each squad led by a corporal and containing two teams, with each team consisting of a SMAW and two Marines; and :*a medium machine gun section, led by a staff sergeant as section leader and consisting of three machine gun squads, with each squad led by a sergeant as squad leader and containing two teams, which each team led by a corporal as team leader and containing one M240G and three Marines). *A rifle company, commanded by a captain as the commanding officer (CO) and assisted by a 1st lieutenant as the company executive officer (XO) who serves as second-in-command, consists of three rifle platoons, a weapons platoon, and a company headquarters, which, in addition to the two officers, includes the first sergeant, company gunnery sergeant, property NCO, and a messenger/driver. :A weapons company, commanded by a major and assisted by a captain as XO, will substitute for the rifle platoons an 81 mm mortar platoon, an anti-armor platoon, and a heavy machine gun platoon. In deference to the more extensive training requirements and complicated tactical considerations necessitated by the crew-served weapons employed by the weapons company, its platoon commanders are usually 1st lieutenants and the platoon sergeants are gunnery sergeants. The company headquarters includes a master sergeant as the operations chief (in lieu of the company gunnery sergeant) and an additional messenger/driver. :A headquarters and service company, commanded by a captain and assisted by a 2nd or 1st lieutenant as the XO, contains the battalion headquarters, which includes the command section (including the battalion CO, battalion XO, and the sergeant major), the executive staff sections (S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4, & S-6), and the chaplain section. The company consists of a company headquarters section, a scout sniper platoon, a communications platoon, a service platoon, and a medical platoon. *An infantry battalion, commanded by a lieutenant colonel and assisted by a major as the battalion XO, consists of three rifle companies, a weapons company, and a headquarters and service company. *An infantry regiment, commanded by a colonel and assisted by a lieutenant colonel as the regimental XO, consists of three battalions, and a regimental headquarters company. *A Marine division, commanded by a major general as the commanding general (CG) and assisted by a brigadier general as the assistant division commander, usually consists of three infantry regiments, an artillery regiment, several separate battalions (i.e., reconnaissance, assault amphibian, tank, light armored reconnaissance, and combat engineer), and a headquarters battalion. The unit designation brigade is only used in the Marine Corps in the form of a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), an intermediate sized Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The MEB is usually commanded by a brigadier general as CG, who is assisted by a colonel as the chief of staff (CoS) of the MEBs general staff and who is \\"dual-hatted\\" as the MEBs second-in-command. The MEB consists of three regimental equivalent combat elements (ground, air, and logistics) and a battalion-sized headquarters element. The ground combat element (GCE) consists of a Regimental Combat Team (RCT), which is a heavily reinforced infantry regiment (including field artillery, infantry reconnaissance, amphibious assault vehicle, tank, light armored reconnaissance, and combat engineer units), itself roughly equivalent to a US Army Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The air, or aviation, combat element (ACE) consists of a composite Marine Aircraft Group containing several helicopter, tilt rotor, tactical fixed wing, and UAV squadrons and/or detachments, as well as aviation ground support, command and control, and air defense units. The MAG is roughly equivalent in terms of numbers of aircraft and personnel to a US Army Combat Aviation Brigade. The logistics combat element (LCE) consists of a combat logistics regiment (CLR) consisting of combat logistics battalions (CLB), and specialized logistical companies and detachments to support the MAGTF. The headquarters, or command, element (CE) consists of specialized companies and detachments that perform various command, control, communications, surveillance, reconnaissance, intelligence, law enforcement, and liaison functions. Two unique unit designations to the Marine Corps are Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) and Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) MAGTFs. The MEU is the smallest MAGTF and consists of approximately 2,200 personnel. Commanded by a colonel with a lieutenant colonel as XO, it consists of a battalion landing team (BLT), a reinforced infantry battalion, as its GCE and a Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM), reinforced with detachments of helicopters, tactical fixed wing, and UAV aircraft, as well as aviation ground support, command and control, and air defense detachments, as its ACE. The MEU's LCE consists of a CLB, and its CE is a company-sized version of the MEB's battalion-sized headquarters group. The MEF is the Marine Corps's equivalent tactical command level to an army corps. The MEF has a lieutenant general as CG with a major general as deputy CG. The MEF consists of a Marine Division as its GCE, a Marine Aircraft Wing as its ACE, a Marine Logistics Group as its LCE, and a regimental-sized MEF Headquarters Group (MEF HQG) as its CE. Battalions, and larger units commanded by a field grade officer, have an executive officer as the second-in-command and an executive staff consisting of: Manpower / Administration & Personnel (S-1), Intelligence (S-2), Operations, Plans & Training (S-3), Logistics (S-4), Civil Affairs (wartime only) (S-5), and Communications (S-6) sections. Units commanded by a general officer have a chief of staff and a general staff in which the staff sections are designated as G-1, G-2, etc. Battalions and larger units replace the company (and battery) first sergeant with a sergeant major, as the senior enlisted advisor to the unit commander. The four Marine divisions are: * 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California * 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina * 3rd Marine Division at Camp Courtney in Okinawa, Japan * 4th Marine Division, a reserve unit headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, with units scattered throughout the United States. In World War II, two more Marine Divisions were formed: the 5th and 6th, which fought in the Pacific War. These divisions were disbanded after the end of the war. The 5th Marine Division was reactivated for service in Vietnam but was disbanded again in the early 1970s. =Aviation combat element (ACE)= The mission of Marine Corps aviation is to provide the MAGTF commander with an aviation combat element (ACE) capable of conducting air operations in support of the seizure and defense of advanced naval bases, and conducting such land operations as may be directed by the Joint Force commander. The ACE supports the MAGTF by providing the six functions of Marine aviation: assault support, anti-air warfare, offensive air support, electronic warfare, control of aircraft and missiles, and aerial reconnaissance. Aviation units are organized into: *Squadrons of 5‚Äì27 aircraft (depending upon aircraft type), tactically organized into sections of 2‚Äì3 aircraft and divisions of 2‚Äì3 sections, as needed for mission requirements (squadrons may also be organized with one or more detachments, containing two or more aircraft, for deployment requirements), commanded by a lieutenant colonel *Groups of 4‚Äì12 squadrons (average of 7 squadrons per group) and a group headquarters, commanded by a colonel *Wings of two or more Marine aircraft groups (MAG), a Marine air control group, and Marine wing headquarters squadron, and a Marine wing headquarters, commanded by a major general as the wing CG with a brigadier general as the assistant wing commander. The four Marine aircraft wings are: * 1st Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler, Okinawa, Japan * 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina * 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California * 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, a reserve unit, headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, with units scattered throughout the United States =Logistics Combat Element (LCE)= Beyond logistics (i.e., motor transport, supply, and maintenance), the LCE provides engineer support (i.e., heavy equipment, bulk fuel and water, utilities, bridging, explosive ordnance disposal, and reinforcement to combat engineer units), medical and dental personnel, and other specialized units (e.g., aerial delivery and landing support). The four Marine logistics groups are: * 1st Marine Logistics Group at Camp Pendleton, California * 2nd Marine Logistics Group at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina * 3rd Marine Logistics Group at Camp Kinser, Okinawa, Japan * 4th Marine Logistics Group, a reserve unit, headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, with units scattered throughout the United States. Marine Corps Special Operations Components Although the notion of a Marine special warfare contribution to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was considered as early as the founding of USSOCOM in the 1980s, it was resisted by the Marine Corps. Then Commandant Paul X. Kelley expressed the popular belief that Marines should support Marines, and that the Corps should not fund a special warfare capability that would not support Marine operations. However, resistance from within the Marine Corps dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corps' \\"crown jewels\\"‚Äîthe 15th and 26th MEU (Special Operations Capable) {MEU(SOC)s}‚Äîsit on the sidelines during the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom while other special warfare units led the way. After a three-year development period, the Marine Corps agreed in 2006 to supply a 2,700-strong unit, Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), which would answer directly to USSOCOM. =Marine Special Operations Command= thumb The Marine Special Operations Command is the Marine Corps's special operations component that reports to United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Currently, MARSOC trains, organizes, equips and, when directed by the Commander, USSOCOM, deploys task organized, scalable, and responsive U.S. Marine Corps special operations forces worldwide in support of combatant commanders and other agencies. The MSOAG, formerly the FMTU, has been operating since 2005, before MARSOC formally existed. MARSOC was formally activated during a February 24 ceremony at Camp Lejeune, N.C., where MARSOC is now headquartered. Fox Company, 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, was the first of the Marine Special Operations Battalions' companies to activate in the Spring of 2006. Drawing its manpower from the core of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Co., Fox Company's creation came at the expense of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Co., which stood down upon the transfer of its platoons to both MARSOC's 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, and a new company (Delta) of 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion. *A fireteam is the basic element of the Marine Special Operations Regiment. Like fireteams in the infantry, MSOR fireteams consist of four Marines; a team leader/grenadier, an automatic rifleman, an assistant automatic rifleman and a rifleman. *A Marine Special Operations Team (MSOT) is made up of three fireteams, in addition to a captain as a team leader, a radio operator and a Navy corpsman. *A Marine Special Operations Company (MSOC), made up of four MSOTs and commanded by a major. *A Marine Special Operations Battalion, made up of four MSOCs and commanded by a lieutenant colonel. The three Marine Special Operations Battalions (MSOBs) are: * 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion at Camp Pendleton, California. * 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. * 3rd Marine Special Operations Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. MARSOC also contains a Marine Special Operations Support Group (SOSG) that trains, equips, structures, and provides specially qualified Marine forces, including operational logistics, intelligence, multipurpose canines, Firepower Control Teams and communications support in order to sustain worldwide special operations missions as directed by Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (COMMARFORSOC). =Marine Corps (Special Operations Capable) forces= The Special Operation Capable forces are the units of the Marine Corps that are fully equipped, and prepared for any hostility, or emergency worldwide. Being very co-dependent of the air-ground task force, they are capable of conducting special operations in conventional warfare, and often overlapping in unconventional methods, comparable to other special operations forces of maritime regions. Many special mission tasks are mostly infantry support units, such as reconnaissance, ANGLICO, and others.

She was murdered in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, New South Wales and the perpetrator has not been apprehended.  Biography  Broadhurst was born in Mount Perry, Queensland, at Mungy Station. She became a singer, winning local eisteddfods, and joined a group known as the Smart Set Diggers who performed in Toowoomba, Queensland. In 1922 she joined a comedy sextet known as the \\"Globe Trotters\\" and later the \\"Broadcasters\\", who toured South East Asia and China. In 1926 she established the Broadhurst Academy in Shanghai, offering tuition in violin, pianoforte, voice production, banjolele playing, modern ballroom dancing, classical dancing, musical culture and journalism.Anne-Marie Van de Ven, Broadhurst, Florence Maud (1899 - 1977) , Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, Melbourne University Press, 2005, pp 46-47. After her return to Queensland in 1927, she sustained head injuries in a car accident. She then went to England and in 1929 married Percy Walter Gladstone Kann, an English stockbroker. They co-directed Pellier Ltd, Robes & Modes, and she called herself Madame Pellier. Kann and Broadhurst separated, and Broadhurst became involved with diesel engineer Leonard Lloyd-Lewis, living in Banstead from 1939. During World War II she joined the Australian Women's Voluntary Services, offering hospitality to Australian soldiers. In 1949, the couple and their son Robert moved to Australia, where she maintained the fiction that she was British. She travelled widely and produced 114 landscape paintings, which were first shown as \\"Paintings of Australia\\" in 1954 at David Jones Art Gallery, Sydney, then later in Brisbane and Canberra. In the late 1950s (or 1961) Lloyd-Lewis left her for a woman younger than their own son. She was a foundation member of the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales and a member of the Society of Interior Designers of Australia, was a teacher of printmaking and sculpture at the National Art School and was also involved in a variety of charitable activities. Broadhurst then ran a motor-sales company with her son. She travelled to England in 1973 to receive cell therapy treatment for her failing eyesight and hearing.  Wallpapers  In 1959 Broadhurst established Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd., which later became Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd, advertised as \\"the only studio of its kind in the world\\". She worked from a studio at 12-24 Roylston Street, Paddington. Her brightly coloured geometric and nature-inspired oversized designs were all hand printed. Technical advances made in her studio included printing onto metallic surfaces, the development of a washable, vinyl-coating finish and a drying rack system that allowed her wallpapers to be produced in large quantities. By 1972, her wallpapers reportedly contained around 800 designs in eighty different colours, while by the mid-1970s she monopolised the quality end of the Australian market and was exporting worldwide. Broadhurst's library of wooden silk-printing screens and film positives was sold to Wilson Fabrics and Wallcoverings in 1978, just one year after her death. However, the decline of wallpaper as a popular form of home furnishing in the 1980s saw the collection languish, and it was later re-sold to Signature Prints Pty Ltd. Signature Prints in turn was purchased by a conglomerate led by current CEO David Lennie in 1989. Lennie had previously run a small wallpaper company in Auckland, New Zealand and briefly met Florence Broadhurst before her death. In the late 1990s, Chee Soon & Fitzgerald, a tiny but influential Sydney design store, held the wholesale and retail distribution rights for Broadhurst wallpaper. This led to some popularity in Sydney design circles but little media attention. In the early 2000s, Signature Prints made a conscious decision to promote Broadhurst's designs overseas, specifically in the UK. This effort, coupled with an international resurgence of interest in wallpaper, greatly increased the designer's profile and led to distribution deals being struck for both the UK and the US in 2003. Five hundred and thirty Broadhurst designs are in the company's collection but only a small proportion are printed by the company as wallpaper and fabric. The company retains strict control over the designs and insists printing take place in its inner-city Sydney factory.

The French swimwear company Vilebrequin released collection using a print by Florence Broadhurst for Father's Day 2019 titled \\"Rabbits and Poodles.\\" They cite her designs as being the \\"perfect antidote to aging.\\" Death Broadhurst was bludgeoned to death with a large piece of timber in her Paddington studio on 15 October 1977. The murder was never solved, but there has been some speculation that Broadhurst was a victim of English Australian serial killer John Wayne Glover, who was convicted of murdering six elderly women on the Sydney North Shore district between 1989 and 1990, and is thought by police to have been responsible for other deaths. In Gillian Armstrong's Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst, friends and employees of Broadhurst stated that they believed the killer may have been known to her and that the motive may have been financial. This was due to the presence of two cups of tea near her body, suggesting a meeting or appointment, and the killer's apparent knowledge of her factory's layout.

Balachander. Produced by Nagendra Babu Anjana Productions, the film features Chiranjeevi and Shobana in the lead roles alongside Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan which marked one of his rare appearances in Telugu films. It also marked the acting debut of Kannada actor and filmmaker Ramesh Aravind in Telugu cinema. P. L. Narayana, Prasad Babu, Sumithra, Devilalitha, and Brahmanandam play supporting roles. Rudraveena focuses on the ideological conflicts between 'Bilahari' Ganapathi Sastry, a reputed carnatic musician and his younger son Suryanarayana \\"Suryam\\" Sastry. Sastry's discrimination towards the people belonging to lower castes is criticised by his son, Suryam, who believes in society's welfare and walks out for good later. The events that led to the change in Sastry's views form the remaining part of the story. Ganesh Patro wrote the film's dialogue and worked on the script with Balachander for two months, though it was tweaked many times during the shoot. Ilaiyaraaja composed the film's soundtrack and background score. R. Raghunadha Reddy was the film's director of photography. Ganesh Kumar edited the film and Mohanam was the art director. Filmed in and around Chennai, Kanchipuram, Courtallam, and Srinagar for 70 days, Rudraveena was produced on a budget of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988 to critical acclaim, the film was a commercial failure, resulting in a loss of 0.6 million. It gained cult status later and is considered one of the best films made by Balachander. The film won three National Film Awards: Best Feature Film on National Integration, Best Music Direction, and Best Male Playback Singer (for S. P. Balasubrahmanyam). It also won four Nandi Awards, including a Special Jury award for Chiranjeevi. Later the same year, Balachander later remade the film into Tamil as Unnal Mudiyum Thambi with Ganesan reprising his role, and Kamal Haasan reprising Chiranjeevi's role.  Plot  Satyanarayana, an aged MP, visits Ramapuram. After talking to the locals, Satyanarayana finds that Ramapuram is well-developed and civilised due to the activities of a man named Suryam. He meets Suryam and asks him what inspired him to take up the task of developing Ramapuram. After learning of Satyanarayana interest in Ramapuram's development, Suryam agrees to relate the village's story in the parliament. Suryanarayana \\"Suryam\\" Sastry is the son of 'Bilahari' Ganapathi Sastry, a reputed carnatic music maestro. Sastry is short tempered and discriminates against people based on their caste. Suryam has an elder brother, Udayam, who was born mute and is adept at playing the nadaswaram. He also has a younger sister Sandhya, who plays the tambura. Suryam and Sastry have ideological differences, as the former prefers to help the needy instead of practicing music. Udayam's wife, Gayathri, keeps mediating between the two, which strengthens her bond with Suryam. After watching a dancer performing on a cliff away from a temple, Suryam meets her and learns that she is Lalitha Sivajyothi, a classical dancer who belongs to a lower caste and is denied entry into the temple. Her father Varalayya, a lawyer by profession, is a social worker and is successful to an extent. On the other hand, an amateur singer named Charukesa follows Sandhya and befriends her. Encouraged by Gayathri, Suryam proposes to Lalitha and is successful. On his way back to home to join Sastry for a concert, Suryam helps a few victims of an accidental fire in Ramapuram. His absence leaves Sastry livid and he refuses to listen to any excuses. Sastry comes across Suryam and Lalitha as a couple, which widens the gap between them. While Gayathri is apprehensive, Udayam remains unaffected. On the way to another concert, Sastry refuses to help an injured lineman named Narayana. A disturbed Suryam emphasises that society's welfare is more important than worshipping music, which makes Sastry declare Charukesa his successor as a musician. Suryam confronts Sastry about this and leaves the house for good after an argument. Suryam meets Varalayya and stays in his client's house. Suryam later meets Narayana's widow and learns that the government has denied him compensation as he was drunk during working hours. He also meets the family of another drunkard named Kishtappa, one of the survivors of the fire. Their situation leaves Suryam disturbed, and he vows to abolish liquor in Ramapuram. Suryam and Lalitha begin their attempts to make the working-class men abandon liquor consumption. Although initially successful, the plan backfires later. Sastry finds that Charukesa and Sandhya are in a relationship, and humiliates the former. After Sandhya's rebellion, Sastry conducts their marriage. After the event, Sastry asks Charukesa to request any gift as dowry. Keeping the past in mind, Charukesa asks Sastry to abandon the Bilahari raga he specialised in as a musician at his future concerts. Sastry agrees half-heartedly and Suryam, who attends the marriage, performs a concert to a positive response. Varalayya plans to conduct the marriage of Suryam and Lalitha, and informs Sastry of this. At Sastry's instigation, a group of drunkards create a ruckus at the venue. They promise to give up drinking if Suryam walks out of the marriage. With Lalitha's consent, Suryam calls off his wedding. His sacrifice earns the respect of the villagers, and the drunkards obey his words. An agitated Udayam and Gayathri leave Sastry's house after learning of his deception. Suryam and Lalitha start a rural development movement named \\"Lalitha Grameena Sveeyasikshana Udyamam\\" and achieve the desired results. Satyanarayana is pleased to learn that twenty-eight villages adopted Suryam's methods and achieved successful development. He also quits consuming alcohol. Suryam gains national recognition for his work and the prime minister announces a felicitation in Ramapuram. Except for Sastry, all of Suryam's family members, including Charukesa, attend the event. Initially reluctant, Sastry arrives shortly after and introduces himself proudly as Suryam's father instead of as a prominent carnatic musician. He also approves Suryam's marriage with Lalitha, much to the happiness of the villagers.

To gain experience in film production, Babu worked at the Geetha Arts company. He started a company named Anjana Productions after his mother K. Anjana Devi. He planned to make an unconventional film without considering Chiranjeevi's on-screen image as an action hero. After watching Sankarabharanam (1980) and Sindhu Bhairavi (1985), Babu approached Chiranjeevi's mentor K. Balachander to direct his maiden production venture. They worked together on Idi Katha Kaadu (1979) and 47 Rojulu (1981); he played the antagonist in both films. Balachander agreed to direct the film; he chose the concept of national integration and rural development after watching Anna Hazare developing Ralegan Siddhi, a village in Maharashtra. He was also inspired by a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer's act of adopting his village in West Godavari district. Balachander approached his favourite screenwriter Ganesh Patro to write the dialogues; Patro was credited for giving a native appeal to Balachander's successful Telugu films. Despite finding the concept obsolete, Patro silently completed the bound script in two months. According to Patro, Balachander tweaked the film's script many times during the shoot. They planned to name the film Bilahari after the Carnatic raga of the same name, but changed it to Rudraveena to reflect the characters' anger, equating it to that of the Hindu god Shiva. Shobana was chosen as the female lead; her experience as a dancer helped the film. After considering many options, Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan was finalised to play Chiranjeevi's father. This was one of the actor's rare appearances in Telugu cinema. Ganesan played 'Bilahari' Ganapathi Sastry, a reputed carnatic musician specialising in songs composed using Bilahari raga. S. P. Balasubramanyam dubbed Ganesan's dialogue portions as well as providing vocals as a playback singer. Rudraveena marked the Telugu cinema debut of Ramesh Aravind, another of Balachander's prot√©g√©s. P. L. Narayana, Prasad Babu, Sumithra, Devilalitha, and Brahmanandam played supporting roles. Kaikala Satyanarayana made a cameo appearance. Ilaiyaraaja was signed to compose the film's soundtrack and background score. R. Raghunadha Reddy was the film's director of photography. Ganesh Kumar edited the film and Mohanam was the art director. Filmmaker Bapu designed the logo of the production company and the film's title. The role written for Narayana was a last minute addition by Balachander; he took inspiration from similar characters in English plays and ballads he had read. Rudraveena principal photography took place at Chennai, Kanchipuram, Courtallam, and Srinagar for 70 days. Balachander later remarked, \\"Chiranjeevi has both Kamal Haasan and Rajnikanth in him. Not only can he do action, he can also act\\".  Music  Ilaiyaraaja composed the film's soundtrack and background score. Sirivennela Sitaramasastri was approached to write the lyrics for the songs after his work in Kasinathuni Viswanath Sirivennela (1986) was noticed. Sitaramasastri penned the lyrics for twelve songs, out of which nine songs form part of the soundtrack. According to Patro, Balachander wanted the songs to convey the story rather than serving the protagonists' dreams; the makers used verses from the poetry anthology Maha Prasthanam, written by Telugu writer Sri Sri, in the song \\"Cheppalani Vundi\\". Rudraveena is considered as one of the acclaimed works of Ilaiyaraaja in Telugu cinema. K. Naresh Kumar of The Hans India commented that K. J. Yesudas and K. S. Chithra bring the song \\"Lalitha Priya Kamalam\\" to life \\"soothingly\\", adding that everything is right about the number in terms of instrumentation. Pulagam Chinnarayana of Sakshi praised Ilaiyaraaja's varied instrumentation in the re-recording and found Sitaramasastri's lyrics \\"optimistic and poetic\\". At the presentation of the Sri Raja-Lakshmi award in November 2006, Balasubrahmanyam performed the song \\"Taralirada\\" at Kalabharathi auditorium, Visakhapatnam. Track list  Release, reception and awards  Rudraveena was produced on a budget of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988, the film received critical acclaim. It was also premiered at the 12th International Film Festival of India. However, it was a commercial failure and Babu had to incur a loss of 0.6 million. It was dubbed as a setback for Chiranjeevi who had starred in a streak of successful films such as Pasivadi Pranam, Swayamkrushi, Jebu Donga (all released in 1987) and Manchi Donga (1988). Babu considered Rudraveena a spiritually awakening film personally and felt that a book could be written about it. The film was remade into Tamil as Unnal Mudiyum Thambi in the same year by Balachander himself, with Kamal Haasan reprising Chiranjeevi's role, while Ganesan reprised his role. At the 36th National Film Awards, Rudraveena won in three categories: Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Best Music Direction, and Best Male Playback Singer (Balasubrahmanyam). With this, it became the only Telugu film after Saptapadi (1981) to receive the Nargis Dutt award. It was also Ilaiyaraaja's third award after Sagara Sangamam (1983) and Sindhu Bhairavi. Sitaramasastri lost the Best Lyricist award with a difference of one vote. Rudraveena also won four Nandi Awards, including the Special Jury award for Chiranjeevi. = Critical reception = The retrospective reviews for the film were positive. In their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen termed Rudraveena a reformist film for Chiranjeevi which aimed to achieve \\"greater critical respectability\\" for the actor by \\"addressing caste in a calculated effort\\". Suresh Krishnamoorthy of The Hindu commented that Rudraveena showcased Chiranjeevi in a different light compared to Marana Mrudangam, a successful mainstream film by the actor released in the same year. Mihir Fadnavis of Daily News and Analysis termed Chiranjeevi's performance in Rudraveena \\"possibly his best ever\\". Pulagam Chinnarayana, writing for Sakshi, called Rudraveena a sugarcoated and non- preachy take on the harsh realities of 1980s Indian society by Balachander. K. Naresh Kumar of The Hans India praised Raghunadha Reddy's cinematography: \\"Reddy provides perfect eye-candy for the discerning visual lovers, packing in multi-dimensional images of the Shaivite abodes of God, preserved wonderfully over time\\". C. V. Aravind of the Deccan Herald stated that Balachander extracted an excellent performance from Chiranjeevi. He compared the film with other Telugu films such as Subhalekha (1982), Swayamkrushi and Aapadbandhavudu (1992) where Chiranjeevi was cast in \\"well-defined\\" character roles that \\"contrasted sharply with his image as a commercial entertainer\\".  Legacy  Rudraveena is considered as one of the cult films in the careers of Balachander and Shobana. In an interview with Rediff.com in April 1997, Chiranjeevi stated that he opted to act in Rudraveena for an image makeover. He added that despite its failure, the film made him happy as it had inspired many villages in Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure as the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Chiranjeevi's Eye & Blood Bank (CEBB) in June 2006 and expressed his appreciation for the initiative; the actor recalled the day when he ruled out the climax of Rudraveena ever happening in real life. Hindustan Times included Rudraveena in their 2015 list of 10 memorable films directed by Balachander. On Chiranjeevi's 60th birthday, Indo-Asian News Service included the film in their list of underrated performances by the actor. Koratala Siva Srimanthudu (2015) starring Mahesh Babu and Shruti Haasan was compared with Rudraveena for its similarities on a thematic level (rural development and father-son conflict). Commenting on the same, Mahesh stated that Srimanthudu was more mainstream and commercial than realistic in its approach.

It was the sister station to KRDO, which Hoth had first put on the air in 1947, Colorado Springs' second radio station. KRDO-FM broadcast a beautiful music format of instrumental songs, and would later shift to easy listening. As the easy listening format began to decline due to older demographics, KRDO-FM flipped to a soft adult contemporary format and adopted the moniker \\"Peak 95.1\\" in 1994. In 1998, KRDO-FM evolved into Hot AC. After being purchased by Citadel Broadcasting, the station prepared for a major format switch. \\"Cat Country 95.1\\" began broadcasting on July 1, 2006, stunting by repeatedly playing Brooks & Dunn's \\"Play Something Country\\". After several days of stunting, the station began its regular mainstream country programming, featuring a complete air staff.

The film was released on January 8, 1944 and stars Bugs Bunny. The title is a variant on Bugs' catch-phrase \\"What's up Doc?\\". It also hints at one of the scenes in the picture.  Plot  The plot centers on the Academy Awards presentation. The action begins with live action color film footage of various Hollywood scenes (edited from A Star Is Born), narrated by Robert C. Bruce. It leads up to the Big Question of the evening: Who will win \\"the\\" Oscar? The film shows the stereotypical red carpet arrivals of stars, as well as a human emcee starting to introduce the Oscar show. At this point the film switches to animation, with the shadow of a now-animated emcee (and now voiced by Mel Blanc) continuing to introduce the Oscar, and Bugs (also Mel Blanc's voice, as usual) assuring the viewer that \\"it's in da bag; I'm a cinch to win\\". Bugs is stunned when the award goes instead to James Cagney (who had actually won in the previous year's ceremony, for Warner's Yankee Doodle Dandy). Shock turns to anger as Bugs declares the results to be \\"sa-bo-TAH-gee\\" and demands a recount. Bugs then tries to make his case by showing clips from Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt (which includes a clip of Hiawatha attempting to \\"cook\\" the rabbit) as proof of his allegedly superior acting (an inside joke, as the cartoon had actually been nominated for an Oscar and lost). He hurls a set of film cans off-screen and tells someone named \\"Smokey\\" to \\"roll 'em!\\"According to IMDB, this is a reference to Schlesinger cameraman/projectionist Henry \\"Smokey\\" Garner. Director Bob Clampett later confirmed this in a 1969 Funnyworld magazine interview. That small clip is now used frequently in the special features for the first volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection. Bugs tells the audience that these are some of his \\"best scenes\\". Immediately a \\"stag reel\\" (with the title card depicting a grinning stag) starts to roll, and the startled Bugs quickly stops it and switches to the right film. The clip starts with a title card of \\"BUGS BUNNY\\" in very large letters, as a brassy orchestral fanfare plays, and ends with an end title card of Bugs bending over to show his cotton tail and giving his toothy grin as a comically sped up version of the Merrie Melodies end theme (Merrily We Roll Along) is heard. There is then a parody of aggressive salesmanship. Bugs beats a big bass drum and parades across the stage with signs like ‚Äú Let Bugs Have It‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive It To Bugs‚Äù. Cigars are then quickly passed out en masse to the audience. Finally, Bugs pleads with the audience, \\"What do you say, folks? Do I get it? Or do I get it?\\" (echoing Fredric March's drunken appeal to the Academy Award banquet audience in A Star Is Born). The emcee asks the audience (in an affected nasal voice), \\"Shall we give it to him, folks?\\" and they yell, \\"Yeah, let's give it to him!\\" whereupon they pelt Bugs with fruits and vegetables (enabling him to briefly do a Carmen Miranda impression)... and an ersatz Oscar labeled \\"booby prize\\", which is actually a gold-plated rabbit statue. Bugs is so pleased at winning it, he remarks, \\"I'll even take youse to bed wit' me every night!\\" The statue suddenly comes alive, asks in a voice like that of radio character, Bert Gordon, \\"Do you mean it?\\", smooches the startled bunny, and takes on an effeminate, hip-swiveling pose. The screen fades out, Clampett's famous vocalized \\"Bay-woop!\\" is heard, and the \\"That's all, Folks!\\" card appears, ending the picture. Analysis The subtext of the short is the self- consciousness of Warner Bros. Cartoons about their then-lack of success at the Academy Awards. The studio had yet to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.Crafton (1998), p. 116 The clips from Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt (1941) allude to this subtext. It was a former nominee for the award and had lost to Lend a Paw (1941).Crafton (1998), p. 116 The live-action film footage derive from the film A Star Is Born (1937).Crafton (1998), p. 116 Footage depict the footprints of the stars at the Chinese Theatre, and nightlife at the Trocadero and the Cocoanut Grove.Crafton (1998), p. 116 The premise of the film is that Bugs Bunny is competing for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He demonstrates his acting ability by transforming into Jerry Colonna, Bing Crosby, Cecil B. DeMille, Katharine Hepburn, and Edward G. Robinson.Crafton (1998), p. 116 As the announcer lists the winner's traits, Bugs transforms to illustrate that they all apply to him: dramatic acting, refined comedy, skill at character roles, and prowess as a screen lover. He demonstrates his character acting by becoming Frankenstein's monster and his romantic acting by changing into Charles Boyer and romancing a carrot.Crafton (1998), p. 116 Bugs campaigns for the award by addressing the people in the movie audience. His methods of campaigning include dispensing cigars, drum beating, and glad-handing. He thus earns a booby prize, a second-class award reminiscent of the miniature Oscars awarded to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).Crafton (1998), p. 116 The implication is that awards are not won by the most talented and deserving, but those capable of lobbying.Crafton (1998), p. 116 The short includes a subtle reference to World War II. There is a newspaper headline announcing the Academy Awards. A sub-headline on the same page reads \\"Jap [Japanese] Cruiser Blown Up\\".

One of such periods include the times between the 4th century and 6th century CE of Gupta Empire because of the large achievements Indians made in the fields of science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy during the Gupta Empire. The decimal numeral system, including the concept of zero, was invented in India during this period. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India. The high points of this cultural creativity are magnificent architectures, sculptures and paintings. The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Vishnu Sharma, and Vatsyayana who made great advancements in many academic fields. Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural center and set the region up as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in Burma, Sri Lanka, Malay Archipelago and Indochina. The Golden Age of India saw achievements. Gupta made novel advances in the sciences, astronomy (Gupta philosophers proposed that the earth was not flat, but was instead round and rotated on an axis by viewing lunar eclipses and discoveries about gravity and the planets of the solar system, which they used to tell the horoscopes), mathematics (the invention of zero, chess and decimal numeral system), literature (Panchatantra, Kama Sutra and other works), architecture (Mahabodhi Temple) and religion. South India Chola Empire under Rajendra Chola c. 1030 C.E. South India in the 10th and 11th century CE under the imperial Cholas is considered as another Golden Age. The period saw extensive achievements in Dravidian architecture, Tamil literature, sculpture and bronze working, quasi-democratic reforms, maritime conquests and trade. The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in building temples have resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture. The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity. They pioneered a centralised form of government and established a disciplined bureaucracy.

The film stars Lauren Lee Smith and Eric Balfour. Its plot concerns an outgoing, sexually aggressive young woman who meets and begins a torrid affair with an equally aggressive young man, which brings a strain on their personal lives. The film contains graphic, unsimulated sexual content. Set and shot in Toronto (primarily The Annex), the film was directed by Clement Virgo. The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Included in the soundtrack is music by Broken Social Scene and Annelise Noronha. Plot The camera slowly zooms out on a young woman masturbating to a porn sex tape. She gets up abruptly and goes out to a party, looking for sex. Leila has learned she has some power over men with sex but feels a part of her is still untouched, holding back, despite her assertiveness. Before she can choose a partner for the night she is corralled by David, into a bathroom, while his girlfriend calls through the door. She leaves, but keeps her eye on David as she picks up a shy guy, with whom she has sex against a fence outside as David watches from his car while his girlfriend, Victoria (Polly Shannon) fellates him. Leila is in complete control of her encounter while David remains completely passive. He next sees her walking down the street, and follows her. She smiles but does not speak to him and breaks into a run, leading him to a playground. They crouch inside a small tunnel and watch each other as she begins to touch herself. But this time he leaves. When Leila sees David again they finally speak to each other, and he takes her home, where they have sex. He asks Leila if she will go out with him on a real date, giving her his number when she leaves. They finally do go out, and begin a real romance. She meets his father, who is physically fragile but very funny, teasing her about having sex and making noise in their apartment. David cares very tenderly for his father, who is charmingly brusque. Leila is still skittish, although she is not intimidated when David's old girlfriend, Victoria (Polly Shannon) confronts her at her job, warning her that David has intimacy issues. When they go back to the club again, Leila dances suggestively with a couple of men while watching David's reaction, and he is hurt and angry when they return to his place. She brushes off his fears when he confesses that he thinks of nothing but her, that he needs her, but she acts like it is all a game. He begs to her to promise that she will not leave him, and she does, but does not believe it herself. When David finds his father dead, he turns to Leila for consolation, but she does not know how to comfort him. This leads to conflict, and ends with him asking her to leave. Later, he reconsiders; but he is unable to find Leila again, as he knows nothing about her except her first name. Leila finds her sexual world more and more unsatisfying and becomes increasingly frustrated. She picks up the shy guy again, but strikes at him in anger when he is unable to follow her peremptory commands, and throws him out of her apartment in disgust. Leila spends time with her parents as they go their separate ways, and gets ready for the wedding while the summer is coming to an end. As she rides her bicycle to the ceremony, David sees her and follows in his truck. He waits outside the synagogue and approaches her as everyone floods out onto the sidewalk following the wedding, and then Rachel (Kristin Lehman) grabs Leila's hand and she calls out to David, to ask if he is coming. At the reception David watches Leila dance with an old man, but she runs away again when he approaches her. This time he follows her all the way home, and all the way inside, telling her he will not leave her again. They reunite and the film ends with the two engaging in a passionate kiss.

Writing for Variety, Leslie Felperin says that \\"Barry Stone's lensing, favoring a soft, Northern-climes afternoon light for the sex scenes in particular, looks dreamy throughout\\", but that \\"with its drawn-out last act and sentimental ending, [this] pic is a long way from being the Gen-Y \\"Last Tango in Paris\\" it would like to think it is.\\" Ron Mashate, writing for Stylus Magazine, concurred in part: :\\"Similar to Virgo's well-received Rude (1995), Lie with Me is about capturing a distinctive mood. In a 2005 interview with NOW Magazine, Virgo explains his intentions with respect to the later film: ::'When I read the book, it wasn't about the story, it was about this feeling that the book conjured up in me, this kind of visceral, raw energy, that was like what I felt when I first fell in love, that sexual aspect of falling in love. That was the challenge of it for me, to take a plot-driven narrative and capture an emotion.' :It‚Äôs certainly the case that Virgo skimped on the narrative in favor of the mood. At times, the film comes off inert and aimless, absent of an apparent conflict. The Bee Hives version of Lover‚Äôs Spit asserts itself, representing Virgo‚Äôs telos: sinuousness, elegiac, inaccessible. And if Woody Allen writes love letters to New York, Virgo is attempting the epistolary equivalent with Toronto.\\" References External links  Category:2000s erotic drama films Category:2005 independent films Category:2005 romantic drama films Category:2005 films Category:Canadian erotic drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian independent films Category:Canadian romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:Erotic romance films Category:Films based on Canadian novels Category:Films directed by Clement Virgo Category:Films set in Toronto Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:2005 drama films ","title":"Lie with Me (film)"},{"id":"6650137","text":"Alton Coleman (November 6, 1955 ‚Äì April 26, 2002) was an American serial killer who, along with accomplice Debra Brown, committed a crime spree across six states in the Midwest between May and July 1984 that resulted in the deaths of eight people. Coleman, who received death sentences in three states, was executed by the state of Ohio in 2002. Brown was also sentenced to death in Indiana, but the death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment without possibility of parole in Illinois. Criminal Background =Alton Coleman= Alton Coleman was born on November 6, 1955, in Waukegan, Illinois. Coleman's mother worked three jobs, and he lived with his 73-year-old grandmother. A middle-school dropout, Coleman was well known to Illinois law enforcement, having been charged with sex crimes six times between 1973 and 1983. Two of those cases were dismissed, with Coleman pleading guilty to lesser charges in two and twice being acquitted. Coleman was scheduled to go on trial in Illinois on charges stemming from the rape of a 14-year-old girl when he fled and began his killing spree. Coleman was diagnosed with mixed personality disorder with antisocial, narcissistic and obsessive features, with additional diagnoses including epileptic spasms, psychosis and borderline personality disorder.Appeal =Debra Brown= Debra Brown, one of eleven children, is borderline intellectually disabled, suffered head trauma as a child, and was diagnosed with dependent personality disorder by a psychiatrist. She was engaged to another man when she met Coleman in 1983, but left her family and moved in with him shortly afterwards. Although a willing participant in Coleman's assaults and murders, Brown had no history of violence or any criminal history prior to their relationship. Murders =Wisconsin and Illinois= Coleman and Brown committed their first murder when they killed 9-year-old Vernita Wheat from Kenosha, Wisconsin. After Coleman had befriended her mother, Juanita Wheat, he abducted Vernita and took her to Waukegan on May 29, 1984. Vernita's badly decomposed corpse was discovered on June 19 in an abandoned building four blocks from Coleman's grandmother's apartment. It was determined she had been raped, and the cause of death was ligature strangulation. On May 31, Coleman befriended Robert Carpenter in Waukegan and spent the night at his home. The next day he borrowed Carpenter's car to go to the store and never returned. =Indiana and Michigan= In June 1984, Coleman and Brown were in Gary, Indiana and encountered two young girls there: 9-year- old Annie and her niece 7-year-old Tamika Turks. The couple sexually assaulted the two children. Annie survived the violent attack, but Tamika did not; her partially decomposed body was discovered on June 19. The same day, Donna Williams, a 25-year-old woman from Gary, disappeared. On July 11, Williams's decomposed body was discovered in Detroit, Michigan, about half a mile from where her car was found. She had been raped and killed by ligature strangulation. On June 28, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer-Jones of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, whom they beat severely. Coleman ripped the telephone from their wall before stealing money and their car. =Ohio= On July 5, Coleman and Brown arrived in Toledo, Ohio, where Coleman befriended Virginia Temple, the mother of several children. When Temple stopped communicating with her relatives, they entered her home and found her young children alone and frightened. Temple and her eldest child, 9-year-old Rachelle, had been strangled to death and left in a crawl space. On the same morning as the Temple murders, Coleman and Brown entered the home of Frank and Dorothy Duvendack in Toledo, who were bound with electrical cords which had been cut. The couple stole the Duvendacks' money and car, and Mrs. Duvendack's stolen watch was later found under another victim. Later that day, Coleman and Brown visited the Dayton home of Reverend Millard Gay and his wife Kathryn. The two stayed with the Gays and accompanied them to a religious service on July 9, where the next day the Gays dropped off the couple in downtown Cincinnati. On July 12, Tonnie Storey, a 15-year-old girl who lived in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, disappeared; her body was discovered eight days later. A bracelet that had been stolen from the Temples was found under Storey's body. On the day of Storey's disappearance, the FBI added Coleman to its Ten Most Wanted List as a \\"special addition\\" as the 11th most wanted. Coleman was just the tenth person since the initiation of the list in 1950 to merit inclusion in such a manner. Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 at about 9:30 a.m. Less than three hours later, they drove away in a car belonging to Harry Walters, who they left unconscious, and his wife Marlene, who was raped and beaten to death. Walters survived and later testified that they had met the couple to discuss their potential purchase of a camper, but that Coleman attacked him with a wooden candlestick. The coroner indicated Marlene had been bludgeoned approximately 20 to 25 times during her violent assault. Shards of a broken soda bottle which bore Coleman's fingerprints were found in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different pairs of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' red Plymouth Reliant, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes, were stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind. =Kentucky, return to Ohio, Illinois and Indiana= Two days later, the Plymouth was found abandoned in Kentucky, where Coleman and Brown had kidnapped Oline Carmical, Jr., a college professor from Williamsburg, and drove back to Ohio with Carmical locked in the trunk of his car. On July 17, they abandoned this stolen vehicle in Dayton, and Carmical, who was still locked in the trunk, was rescued by authorities. Coleman and Brown returned to the home of the Gays, accosting them with guns. Reverend Gay, who at this time recognized Coleman as a wanted fugitive, asked, \\"Why you want to do us like that, like this?\\" Coleman responded: \\"I'm not going to kill you, but we generally kill them where we go.\\" Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward Evanston, Illinois. Along the way, they stole another car in Indianapolis and killed its owner, 75-year-old Eugene Scott. Arrest and conviction Three days later, on July 20, Coleman and Brown were arrested in Evanston. As they walked westward across an intersection, they passed immediately in front of a motorist who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. The motorist drove north to a gas station and notified the police. The couple were soon spotted sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park. As two police sergeants approached Coleman, Brown was observed walking away toward the rear of the park. Two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston police station, where both were identified by their fingerprints. As Coleman was strip-searched, a steak knife was found between two pairs of sweat socks he was wearing. A shopping bag full of varied T-shirts and caps was found in the couple's possession; officers learned that the pair stopped every three to four blocks as they walked and changed shirts and caps.Arresting officers, Scharm, Trigoura, Hynds, Walker, Grinnel A week after their arrest, more than 50 law enforcement officials from six jurisdictions met to plan their strategy for prosecuting Coleman and Brown. Seeking the death penalty for Coleman and Brown, Michigan was quickly ruled out because it did not employ capital punishment. It was decided to give Ohio the first attempt at sentencing, with U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb stating, \\"We are convinced that prosecution (in Ohio) can most quickly and most likely result in the swiftest imposition of the death penalty against Alton Coleman and Debra Brown\\". The state of Ohio convicted Coleman and Brown, finding them guilty of the rape and murder of Tonnie Storey in Cincinnati and Marlene Walters in Norwood, but not for the murders of Virginia and Rachelle Temple in Toledo. Coleman and Brown were both sentenced to death. Coleman's case was sent to the U.S. Supreme Court several times between 1985 and 2002, but his numerous arguments that his conviction and death sentence were unconstitutional failed to sway the justices. However, Coleman's death sentence in relation to the Storey killing was overturned in a separate proceeding. Despite this, Coleman's death sentence in relation to the Walters murder remained upheld. In addition to the death sentences, Coleman and Brown were each sentenced to twenty years in prison for transporting their kidnapping victim Oline Carmical across a state line. Execution of Coleman On April 25, 2002, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a claim by Coleman's attorneys that the state's plan to accommodate the large number of victims and survivors who wanted to view the execution would turn it into a \\"spectator sport\\". So many victims and survivors of Coleman's crimes were allowed to witness the execution that prison officials had to set up a closed-circuit viewing venue outside of the building. For his last meal, Coleman ordered a well-done filet mignon smothered with mushrooms, fried chicken breasts, a salad with French dressing, sweet potato pie topped with whipped cream, French fries, collard greens, onion rings, cornbread, broccoli with melted cheese, biscuits and gravy, and Cherry Coke. On April 26, reciting Psalm 23, Alton Coleman was executed by lethal injection in the death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Reginald Wilkinson, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said Coleman had not directly expressed remorse for the killings, but that he had \\"admitted what he's done in his own convoluted way.\\" Coleman had received two death sentences from Ohio, and one each from Illinois and Indiana. At the time of his execution, he was the only condemned person in the United States to have death sentences in three states. Imprisonment of Brown Brown, who was originally sentenced to be executed in Ohio for her complicity in the crimes, had her death sentence commuted to life imprisonment by Governor Richard Celeste in 1991. In commuting Brown's sentence, Celeste cited her low IQ scores, ranging from 59 to 74, and her \\"master-slave\\" relationship with Coleman influencing her actions. Brown was one of eight Ohio death row inmates (including all four of the Ohio's female death row inmates) to have her sentence commuted by Celeste, a staunch opponent of capital punishment, a week before he left office. Despite her non-violent history before the spree, Brown was initially unrepentant for her acts. During the sentencing phase of her first Ohio trial, she sent a note to the judge which read in part: \\"I killed the bitch and I don't give a damn. I had fun out of it.\\" She was also given a death sentence for the murder of Tamika Turks in Indiana; however that sentence was ultimately commuted to 140 years imprisonment in 2018. Brown is currently serving her sentence without possibility of parole at the Dayton Correctional Institution in Dayton, Ohio. She finally expressed remorse for her crimes when she apologized to the victims' families in a video in 2005. Racial motive Some authorities believe that Coleman and Brown (who are both African- American) usually selected black victims because they knew they would blend in better in the black community, noting that their crimes lacked a racial motive. However, on page 184 in The Anatomy of Motive, John E. Douglas, a retired FBI profiler, states that Coleman, in the middle of a vicious sexual assault, \\"went into a practically incoherent tirade about how blacks were forcing him to rape and murder other blacks, as if that could somehow explain and justify his actions.\\" Coleman and Brown left a racist slogan - \\"I hate niggers. Death\\" - written in lipstick at the scene of the rape and murder of Tonnie Storey, one of their victims who was not African-American.

Beginning her career by entertaining British troops in France during World War I, she popularised such songs as \\"Danny Boy\\". She was a principal soprano with the D'Oyly Carte from 1919 to 1926, also recording several of her roles with the company both during that time and afterwards. She married another D'Oyly Carte performer, J. Ivan \\"Jimmy\\" Menzies, in 1923.

Pinafore and Gianetta in The Gondoliers, and in the smaller part of Kate in The Yeomen of the Guard. She soon added (sometimes sharing) the leading roles of Aline in The Sorcerer, Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance and Phyllis in Iolanthe. She also briefly played the small role of Lady Ella in Patience. She was immediately singled out for praise: The Observer called her \\"a vocalist of real distinction\\".\\"At the Play\\", The Observer , 5 October 1919, p. 7 Her colleague, Derek Oldham said of her Mabel, \\"Every note dead in its centre, every run as clear as a whistle, and the whole number sung with an ease and mastery which has never been bettered.\\"\\"Elsie Griffin\\" at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 7 June 2010 In 1921, she added the roles of Yum-Yum in The Mikado and Rose Maybud in Ruddigore. In 1923, Griffin married fellow D'Oyly Carte artiste Ivan Menzies. The couple had a daughter, Mahala Menzies. She continued to play or share these principal soprano roles and sometimes the two smaller ones, finally adding to her repertoire the part of Casilda in The Gondoliers in 1925. She played Yum-Yum in the company's four- minute silent promotional film of The Mikado in 1926.Shepherd, Marc. \\"The 1926 D'Oyly Carte Mikado Film\\" .

In 1929, Griffin appeared at the Playhouse Theatre in The Rose and the Ring.The Times, 15 January 1929, p. 10 She performed frequently in concerts, oratorio and variety, giving on one occasion at the London Coliseum \\"a not over-exhilarating exhibition of that after dinner, drawing room type of singing which is happily a thing of the past.\\"The Times, 15 October 1929, p. 14 As a broadcaster, Griffin was continually engaged by the BBC in a range of work from light duets,The Times, 22 August 1927, p. 8 comic duets (with her husband),The Times, 26 February 1929, p. 26 and solos,The Times, 30 March 1929, p. 8 to opera, appearing in broadcasts of Delibes's comic opera Le roi l'a dit with Heddle Nash and George Baker,The Times, 29 July 1929, p. 8 and Carmen.The Times, 29 January 1935, p. 10; and 26 April 1935, p. 7 Griffin appeared in a British tour of Wild Violets, and toured in South Africa in Gilbert and Sullivan operas and in Lilac Time in 1933 with the J. C. Williamson company. She also toured with the Carl Rosa Opera Company from 1934 to 1937, singing leading roles in Die Fledermaus, The Barber of Seville, Carmen, Romeo and Juliet, The Tales of Hoffmann, Faust and The Elixir of Love. Her last stage role was in The Vanishing Island, a Moral Re-Armament musical, in which she and her husband toured around the world from 1955 until 1957.The Times disparaged the show: \\"Feeble ... halting ... half-hearted. ... Artistically it is as if Gilbert had gone solemn on Sullivan.\\" See \\"London Hippodrome ‚Äì The Vanishing Island\\", The Times, 8 June 1956, p. 3 Despite chronic illness, during the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's centennial season in 1975, Griffin and her husband participated in the final performance of Trial by Jury, in which the company's regular chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company.The Savoyard, Vol. 14, No. 2, September 1975 Griffin died in Blackheath, Surrey, in 1989, aged 94. The Times called her \\"one of the leading coloratura sopranos in the 1920s and 1930s\\". A blue plaque at St. Michael's on the Mount Primary School commemorates her life. Recordings Griffin was an experienced recording artist by the time she joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Her recordings with the company included Rose Maybud and Zorah in Ruddigore (1924) and Yum-Yum in The Mikado (1926). She also sang Yum-Yum in a BBC radio broadcast with D'Oyly Carte that year. After she left the company, she returned to record Mabel in Pirates (1929), Kate in Yeomen (1929) and Josephine in Pinafore (1930). Her 1929 recording of \\"Poor Wandering One\\" from the Pirates set, when released separately, was voted the best British gramophone solo that year, and a review in The Gramophone said, \\"It is Elsie Griffin, however, with her deliciously fresh and effortless singing, who demands ‚Äì and receives ‚Äì the big bouquet. Her \\"Poor Wandering One\\" is a sheer joy ‚Äì brilliant but never shrill, and with trills that would not discredit the great Galli-Curci herself.\\"The Gramophone, September 1929, Vol. VII, p.169 When the 1929 recording was reissued on LP in 1981, a critic for The New York Times wrote that her \\"'secure coloratura and bell-like purity of tone' made her the definitive Mabel.\\" Notes References * Introduction by Martyn Green.

Most of these kinds of spacecraft propulsion systems work by electrically expelling propellant (reaction mass) at high speed. Electric thrusters typically use much less propellant than chemical rockets because they have a higher exhaust speed (operate at a higher specific impulse) than chemical rockets.Choueiri, Edgar Y. (2009) New dawn of electric rocket Scientific American 300, 58‚Äì65 Due to limited electric power the thrust is much weaker compared to chemical rockets, but electric propulsion can provide a small thrust for a long duration of time. Electric propulsion can achieve high speeds over long periods and thus can work better than chemical rockets for some deep space missions. Electric propulsion is now a mature and widely used technology on spacecraft. Russian satellites have used electric propulsion for decadesElectric Propulsion Research at Institute of Fundamental Technological Research and it is predicted that by 2020, half of all new satellites will carry full electric propulsion.Beyond Frontiers Broadgate Publications (September 2016) pp20 , over 500 spacecraft operated throughout the Solar System use electric propulsion for station keeping, orbit raising, or primary propulsion. In the future, the most advanced electric thrusters may be able to impart a Delta-v of 100 km/s, which is enough to take a spacecraft to the outer planets of the Solar System (with nuclear power), but is insufficient for interstellar travel.Choueiri, Edgar Y.

Landis. Laser-powered Interstellar Probe on the Geoffrey A. Landis: Science. papers available on the web However, electric propulsion is not a method suitable for launches from the Earth's surface, as the thrust for such systems is too weak. History The idea of electric propulsion for spacecraft dates back to 1911, introduced in a publication by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Earlier, Robert Goddard had noted such a possibility in his personal notebook. Electrically powered propulsion with a nuclear reactor was considered by Dr. Tony Martin for interstellar Project Daedalus in 1973, but the novel approach was rejected because of very low thrust, the heavy equipment needed to convert nuclear energy into electricity, and as a result a small acceleration, which would take a century to achieve the desired speed.PROJECT DAEDALUS: THE PROPULSION SYSTEM Part 1; Theoretical considerations and calculations. 2. REVIEW OF ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS The demonstration of electric propulsion was an ion engine carried on board the SERT-1 (Space Electric Rocket Test) spacecraft,NASA Glenn Contributions to Deep Space 1Ronald J.

A follow-up mission launched on 3 February 1970, SERT-2, carried two ion thrusters, one operated for more than five months and the other for almost three months.NASA Glenn, \\"SPACE ELECTRIC ROCKET TEST II (SERT II)\\" (Accessed 1 July 2010)SERT page at Astronautix (Accessed 1 July 2010) By the early 2010s, many satellite manufacturers were offering electric propulsion options on their satellites‚Äîmostly for on-orbit attitude control‚Äîwhile some commercial communication satellite operators were beginning to use them for geosynchronous orbit insertion in place of traditional chemical rocket engines. Types =Ion and plasma drives= These types of rocket-like reaction engines use electric energy to obtain thrust from propellant carried with the vehicle. Unlike rocket engines, these kinds of engines do not necessarily have rocket nozzles, and thus many types are not considered true rockets. Electric propulsion thrusters for spacecraft may be grouped into three families based on the type of force used to accelerate the ions of the plasma: Electrostatic If the acceleration is caused mainly by the Coulomb force (i.e. application of a static electric field in the direction of the acceleration) the device is considered electrostatic. *Gridded ion thruster **NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) **HiPEP **Radiofrequency ion thruster *Hall effect thruster **SPT ‚Äì Stationary Plasma Thruster **TAL ‚Äì Thruster with Anode Layer *Colloid ion thruster *Field emission electric propulsion *Nano-particle field extraction thruster Electrothermal The electrothermal category groups the devices where electromagnetic fields are used to generate a plasma to increase the temperature of the bulk propellant. The thermal energy imparted to the propellant gas is then converted into kinetic energy by a nozzle of either solid material or magnetic fields. Low molecular weight gases (e.g. hydrogen, helium, ammonia) are preferred propellants for this kind of system. An electrothermal engine uses a nozzle to convert the heat of a gas into linear motion in its molecules, so it is a true rocket even though the energy producing the heat comes from an external source. Performance of electrothermal systems in terms of specific impulse (Isp) is somewhat modest (500 to ~1000 seconds), but exceeds that of cold gas thrusters, monopropellant rockets, and even most bipropellant rockets. In the USSR, electrothermal engines were used since 1971; the Soviet \\"Meteor-3\\", \\"Meteor-Priroda\\", \\"Resurs-O\\" satellite series and the Russian \\"Elektro\\" satellite are equipped with them. Electrothermal systems by Aerojet (MR-510) are currently used on Lockheed Martin A2100 satellites using hydrazine as a propellant. *Arcjet *Microwave arcjet *Resistojet *Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR) Electromagnetic If ions are accelerated either by the Lorentz force or by the effect of electromagnetic fields where the electric field is not in the direction of the acceleration, the device is considered electromagnetic. *Electrodeless plasma thruster *Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster *Pulsed inductive thruster *Pulsed plasma thruster *Helicon Double Layer Thruster =Non-ion drives= Photonic Photonic drive does not expel matter for reaction thrust, only photons. See Laser propulsion, Photonic Laser Thruster, Photon rocket. Electrodynamic tether Electrodynamic tethers are long conducting wires, such as one deployed from a tether satellite, which can operate on electromagnetic principles as generators, by converting their kinetic energy to electric energy, or as motors, converting electric energy to kinetic energy.NASA, Tethers In Space Handbook, edited by M.L. Cosmo and E.C. Lorenzini, Third Edition December 1997 (accessed 20 October 2010); see also version at NASA MSFC; available on scribd Electric potential is generated across a conductive tether by its motion through the Earth's magnetic field. The choice of the metal conductor to be used in an electrodynamic tether is determined by a variety of factors. Primary factors usually include high electrical conductivity, and low density. Secondary factors, depending on the application, include cost, strength, and melting point.  Controversial  A number of propulsion methods have been proposed, where it is unclear that they can work according to the currently-understood laws of physics, including: *Quantum Vacuum Plasma Thruster *EM Drive or Cannae Drive =Steady vs. unsteady= Electric propulsion systems can also be characterized as either steady (continuous firing for a prescribed duration) or unsteady (pulsed firings accumulating to a desired impulse). However, these classifications are not unique to electric propulsion systems and can be applied to all types of propulsion engines. Dynamic properties Electrically powered rocket engines provide lower thrust compared to chemical rockets by several orders of magnitude because of the limited electrical power possible to provide in a spacecraft. A chemical rocket imparts energy to the combustion products directly, whereas an electrical system requires several steps. However, the high velocity and lower reaction mass expended for the same thrust allows electric rockets to run for a long time. This differs from the typical chemical-powered spacecraft, where the engines run only in short intervals of time, while the spacecraft mostly follows an inertial trajectory. When near a planet, low-thrust propulsion may not offset the gravitational attraction of the planet. An electric rocket engine cannot provide enough thrust to lift the vehicle from a planet's surface, but a low thrust applied for a long interval can allow a spacecraft to maneuver near a planet.

He played a major role in the political affairs of Tamil country. Once an official in the service of the Chola king Kulothunga Chola III (1178-1218), Kopperunchinga utilized the opportunity arising out of the Pandyan invasion of the Chola country to become an independent king. Inscriptions of Kopperunchinga I are few since his kingdom was still forming during most of his life, while he was actively engaged in conflict with other powers. Life Kopperunchinga I, who is referred to variously as Jiya-Mahipati, Alagiyasiyan, Sakalbhuvana- chakravartin Kopperunjinga and Manavalapperumal, was a subordinate of Kulothunga Chola III between 1191 and 1195. During this period the Chola empire was declining after many years of glory. During the final years of Kolothunga III's rule, the Pandya Maravarman Sundara Pandya defeated his son Rajaraja III and made the Chola subordinate to Pandya rule; thus marking the beginning of the final demise of the Cholas. Kopperunchinga I, though related to the Chola king by marital ties and an officer in his government until c. 1213, took advantage of the confusion, by strengthening his personal position. He garrisoned the town of Sendamangalam in the former South Arcot district, converting it into a military stronghold. Consolidation =Conflicts with Yadavas and Hoysalas= Kopperunchinga's ambition brought him into conflict with Yadava king Singhana II, with whom he fought a battle at Uratti in 1222 or 1223 CE. Soon after this he fought Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II in 1224. The Hoysala king won this battle and the Kadavas were suppressed for a while. On re-establishing the supremacy previously exercised by the Cholas, the Hoysala king assumed the titles Establisher of the Chola country and Destroyer of the demon Kadavaraya. =Defeat of the Cholas= Kopperunchinga's defeat at the hands of the Hoysalas did not hold him back long. He presently defeated the Chola king Rajaraja Chola III at the battle of Tellaru and imprisoned the king and his ministers at Sendamangalam in 1231-1232 as he did not know him very well. Rajaraja Chola III immediately appealed to the Hoysala king for help. A Chola inscription states that Kopperunchinga was helped by the Lanka king Parakrama Bahu II in the battle. To signify his victory Kopperunchinga I assumed the title Sakalabhuvanachakravartin (Emperor of the Universe) and the epithet Solanai-sirai-yittu-vaittu Solanadu-konda Alagiyasiyan (Alagiasiyan who imprisoned the Chola and conquered the Chola country). =Defeat of the Hoysalas= While the Hoysala king was preparing to lay siege to Kopperunchinga's capital of Sendamangalam to counter the Kadava's rise, Kopperunchinga engaged the Hoysala armies at Perumbalur near Tiruchi in 1241 and killed the Hoysala generals Kesava, Harihara-Dandanayaka and others and seized their women and property. To protect against further attacks from the Hoysalas, Kopperunchinga built a fort at Tiruvenkadu on the banks of the river Kaveri. At the time of his death in 1242, he left his kingdom in a strong position. The king informs through an inscription as to how prior to his expedition against both Sundara Pandyan and Hosal. In a dream he was ordered by Goddess Mother Earth to destroy the evil kingdoms that were burdening her. Extent of influence The Pallava king seems to have had extensive influence over the Deccan and other parts of subcontinent. A festival in his honor was conducted in ancient temples at Sree Kalahasti (now in Andrha Pradesh), Draksharama coincided with the king's natal asterism of Tiruvonam. This is evidenced in epigraphs. The Pallava chief seems to have had extensive influence in the Asian region as traders from kingdoms on banks of river ganga namely radha desam (southern UP) visited the country to trade. An official called Kambujattu Acharya from Kambujadesam (Vietnam), came and took charge as a priestly official at Srirangam temple during his time. This is evidenced by epigraphs that register an order of the officer Solakon, an officer of Kopperunjingan. It exempted from taxes lands given for the maintenance of gardeners looking after ‚ÄòTiruchchirrambalamudaiyan-tirunandavanam‚Äô garden. It was formed by Gangayar (meaning from banks of ganga) Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyar alias Udaiyar Isvarasivar of Savarnna-gotra and belonging to the Southern Radha country in Uttarapatha (UP). The garden provided garlands to the god Udaiyar Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyar and the goddess Tirukkamakkottamudaiya- Periyanachchiyar. Charitable endowments Kopperunchinga I was a patron of Tamil literature. He was addressed by his officials as Devar Tirumeni. A great devotee of the god Nataraja at Chidambaram, he constructed the southern and eastern gopura (towers) of the temple there; he greatly improved the ancient temples at Vennainallur and Vriddhachalam. At this ancient temple at Tiruvennainallur he presented the deity with a necklace containing 2,088 gems, reportedly a personal gift to the king's ancestor by lord Indran, the king of gods, seeking his blessing for victory in war. The temple for goddess Bhagawati (durga) at Chidambaram, which is still a cynosure for the eye was built by him in 1231 A.D. By this the Pallava chieftain marked his victory over the Hoysalas. He undertook many infrastructure activities, laying roads, opening schools and colleges, building water tanks and ponds and canals and improving agricultural infrastructure. He built a library consisting of several stories on the banks of Pennai river. He performed deeds of munificence during a pilgrimage to sacred places on the southern bank of the Kaveri river in Solamandalam.

He briefly served as a regent during the reign of Emperor Xiaoming. Background and early career Wuniuyu Qiannian was born from a line of Northern Wei nobles of Xianbei ethnicity. His great-grandfather Wuniuyu Lidi (ÂãøÂø∏‰∫éÊ†óÁ£æ) was one of Northern Wei's most famous generals during the reigns of Emperor Mingyuan and Emperor Taiwu. His father Wuniuyu Lie (ÂãøÂø∏‰∫éÁÉà) served as a general during the reigns of Emperor Xiaowen and Emperor Xuanwu. Wuniuyu Qiannian himself became a low level official during the regency of Emperor Xiaowen's stepgrandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Feng. Grand Empress Dowager Feng was strict and often punished officials for even minor offenses, but Wuniuyu Zhong was said to be diligent and honest, and was never punished by her. Emperor Xiaowen favored him as well, and steadily promoted him. Emperor Xiaowen also changed his name to Wuniuyu Deng (ÂãøÂø∏‰∫éÁôª). In 496, pursuant to Emperor Xiaowen's edict to change Xianbei names to Han names as part of his sinicization campaign, the Wuniuyu clan's name was changed to Yu. Service under Emperor Xuanwu After Emperor Xiaowen's death in 499 and succession by hisson Emperor Xuanwu, Yu Deng's father Yu Lie continued to serve in the administration, and Yu Lie soon ran into conflicts with one of the regents, Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Yuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁ¶ß) the Prince of Xianyang, over Yuan Xi's arrogance and wastefulness, as well as Yuan Xi's use of items that were supposed to be only usable by the emperor. Yu Deng was by this point an attendant of the emperor, and through him, Yu Lie reported Yuan Xian's faults to the emperor, leading to Emperor Xuanwu's relieving Yuan Xi and another uncle, Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng, of their responsibilities in 501. When Yuan Xi planned a rebellion later that year, Yu Deng was involved in protecting Emperor Xuanwu arresting Yuan Xi and his cohorts, and was rewarded for his accomplishments. Emperor Xuanwu also changed his name further to Yu Zhong‚Äîwith \\"Zhong\\" meaning \\"faithful.\\" Later that year, Yu Lie died, and Yu Zhong left governmental service to observe the mourning period for his father. However, he was soon recalled to the government, and he soon began to have conflicts with Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Yuan Xiang (ÂÖÉË©≥) the Prince of Beihai, who had taken over Yuan Xi's responsibilities, as Yuan Xiang had grown corrupt and arrogant. Yuan Xiang therefore ostensibly promoted Yu, but used the promotion to take Yu from positions where he would see the emperor often. After Yuan Xiang was removed by Emperor Xuanwu in 504, Yu appeared to be continually promoted, and in 505 Emperor Xuanwu sent him on a tour of the western provinces to overview their administrative productivity. Throughout the rest of Emperor Xuanwu's reign, his power increased, which at times put him at odds with Emperor Xuanwu's powerful maternal uncle Gao Zhao. Service under Emperor Xiaoming Emperor Xuanwu died suddenly in 515. Yu and the official Cui Guang (Â¥îÂÖâ), without first consulting Emperor Xuanwu's wife Empress Gao (Gao Zhao's niece), quickly declared Emperor Xuanwu's young son, the crown prince Yuan Xu, emperor (as Emperor Xiaoming). When Empress Gao wanted to put Emperor Xiaoming's mother Consort Hu to death, Yu, Cui, the eunuch Liu Teng (ÂäâÈ®∞), and the general Hou Gang (‰æØÂâõ), protected Consort Hu by hiding her. Yu and Cui soon forced Empress Gao to confer regent authorities on Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Yuan Yong the Prince of Gaoyang and Emperor Xiaowen's cousin Yuan Cheng (ÂÖÉÊæÑ) the Prince of Rencheng, and when Gao Zhao subsequently returned to the capital Luoyang from a military campaign against rival Liang Dynasty that Emperor Xuanwu had commissioned, Yu and Yuan Yong ambushed him and put him to death. Empress Gao was removed, and Consort Hu became empress dowager. Yu Zhong, by this point, was in control of the government, and while he was not in name regent, he was effectively the regent, making almost all key decisions. He had himself created the Duke of Changshan. The officials Pei Zhi (Ë£¥Ê§ç) and Guo Zuo (ÈÉ≠Á•ö), who were unhappy about Yu's authoritarian acts, secretly suggested to Yuan Yong to have Yu removed from his post and sent to a province to be governor. Yu heard the news and falsely accused Pei and Guo of crimes. Pei and Guo were executed, and Yu wanted to kill Yuan Yong as well, but Cui refused to agree, and so Yuan Yong was merely removed of his post. After Yu had effectively served as regent for six months, however, Empress Dowager Hu assumed titular regency, and while she appreciated Yu's saving her life, she also continuously received reports that Yu was abusing his power, and so she had him sent to Ji Province (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, modern central Hebei) to serve as governor. Soon, Yu's ducal title was stripped and many of his acts while in power were reversed, but because Empress Dowager Hu remembered what he had done for her, she soon recalled him to the capital and gave him an honorary post, but did not put him in power any more. In 516, she created him the Duke of Lingshou. He died in 518, and while initially, it was proposed that his posthumous name be \\"Wuchou\\" (meaning \\"martial and abusive\\"), Empress Dowager Hu instead declared it to be \\"Wujing\\" (meaning \\"martial and alert\\").

Fossil remains of Eosipterus dated back to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous, 124.6 million years ago. History and etymology The genus was named in 1997 by Ji Shu'an and Ji Qiang. The type species is Eosipterus yangi. The genus name is derived from Greek eos, \\"dawn\\" and Greek pteron, \\"wing\\" with a Latin ending; and a grammar error: normally the combination would have resulted in \\"eopterus\\". The \\"dawn\\" element refers to its age but also to China being \\"in the east\\". The specific name honours paleontologist Yang Daihuan. The genus is based on the holotype specimen, GMV2117, found near Jinggangshan in western Liaoning Province, in the Yixian Formation. It was the first pterosaur discovered in that region. It consists of a partial crushed skeleton of a subadult individual on a slab, lacking skull and neck. Most vertebrae have been severely damaged and even their number cannot be determined. The authors state that eighteen detached belly ribs are present in the matrix. Description =Postcranial skeleton= The wings are robust and elongated. The wing finger has the standard four phalanges, a difference from the possibly related Beipiaopterus which has lost the fourth phalanx. Total wingspan was about . The pelvis is not well preserved. The femur has a length of ; the tibia of . The fibula is strongly reduced. The foot claws are slightly curved; the fifth toe has been reduced to a single claw. Classification The authors placed Eosipterus in a general Pterodactyloidea incertae sedis; in 1999 a placement within Pterodactylidae was suggested, and even a synonymy with Pterodactylus was proposed within a hypothesis that the lower Yixian Formation dated from the Late Jurassic. A cladistic study in 2006 found that it was a member of the Ctenochasmatidae ‚Äî David Unwin more precisely assigned it to the Ctenochasmatinae. Below is cladogram following a topology by Andres, Clark and Xu (2014). In the analysis, they recovered Eosipterus within the family Ctenochasmatidae, more precisely within the tribe Pterodaustrini, placed in a more derived position than Pterodaustro.

The short was released on May 8, 1948, and features Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. Plot The cartoon opens with titles featuring an instrumental of \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" (also one of the theme songs to the Popeye cartoon series), segu√©ing to a scene of Sam digging a hole to bury his treasure on a beach. Sam is singing the stereotypical pirate shanty \\"Dead Man's Chest\\"‚Äîon the second strain, Sam switches from the typical \\"yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!\\" to a decidedly more original \\"yo-ho-ho and a bottle of... Ma's old fashioned ci- der\\" with a conga kick on the last syllable and a parody of \\"Dad's Old- Fashioned Root Beer\\", a well-known radio advertising jingle at that time. In attempting to bury his treasure, Sam has encroached on Bugs' domain, as Bugs happens to have his rabbit hole there on the beach. When Bugs asks him who he is, he responds in his typical way: \\"What's up, doc?! I ain't no doc! I'm a pirate! Sea-Goin' Sam, the blood-thirstiest, shoot-'em-first-iest, doggone worst-iest buccaneer has ever sailed the Spanish main!\\" To protect the location of his treasure, Sam prepares to shoot Bugs, claiming \\"Dead rabbits tell no tales!\\" Bugs then temporarily tricks Sam into trying to shoot himself in the head by saying: \\"Now, just a minute, Red. Ain't you got that wrong? You mean dead men tell no tales.\\" After realizing he's been tricked, Sam grounds his teeth together so hard they shatter before he fires at Bugs. Bugs escapes in a tied lifeboat, at one point rowing himself towards a ship without the boat. Following, Sam swims towards the ship to retrieve the paddles from where Bugs left them (oblivious that he doesn't even need them since he already made it to the ship without them), then returns to the lifeboat, which he then rows back to the ship. As Sam searches for Bugs on the ship, he sees Bugs disguised as Captain Bligh (effecting the voice and thick-lipped appearance of Charles Laughton in his portrayal of Bligh in Mutiny On The Bounty). Sam takes criticism from \\"Captain Bligh\\" before being ordered a bunch of chores. Sam soon realizes he's been tricked (again), and follows a fleeing Bugs, but crashes into the mast while doing so. In a side gag, Bugs is trying to hide and a pesky parrot keeps crowing to Sam, \\"He's in there! He's in there! Awk!\\" Finally, Bugs asks the parrot, \\"Polly want a cracker?\\" The parrot changes his tune, \\"Polly want a cracker! Polly want a cracker! Awk!\\" Bugs hands him a lit firecracker, which promptly explodes, blasting all of the parrot's feathers off, leaving him dazed and smoldering. His last words before he faints are, \\"Me and my big mouth!\\" For the next part, Bugs poses as the now-unconscious parrot to lead Sam into a cannon. Bugs lights the fuse, and then, \\"KABOOM!\\" The cannon explodes and Sam falls out of the barrel. In a series of gags that mildly anticipate the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner series, Bugs is in the crow's nest and Sam tries various unsuccessful attempts to get to him; Bugs told him that the elevator is out of order and tosses him a rope. But, when Sam climbs up, he climbs back down and crashes on the ground below. For his next attempt, he made a seesaw, and puts a ball on it, but that kind of failed too. In another one, that skirts the laws of physics, Bugs tells Sam he's going to jump. Instead, Bugs drops a convenient anvil over the side of the crow's nest, Sam catches it, and the anvil's momentum causes the entire ship (\\"except for the crow's nest\\") to submerge. Sam mouths some apparent curses underwater, then tosses the anvil overboard and the ship resurfaces. When Bugs comes down to check on Sam, Sam proceeds to attack him with his sword, making Bugs mad that he's \\"sore again\\". Bugs crawls in a hatch in the ship's side, with Sam following with his sword: \\"Ooooh, I'll keelhaul you for this!\\". When he opens the board, he is blasted by a cannon. Bugs opens the hatch to Sam's left and calls: \\"Yoo-hoo! Mr. Pirate!\\". Sam opens that board and, again, gets blasted by a cannon. Bugs opens another hatch and calls: \\"Oh, uh, Redbeard!\\". Sam, trying to avoid getting blasted again, decides to open up the hatch with his sword from a safe distance. Nothing there. Suddenly, another hatch opens in his face and a cannon blasts Sam once more, much to his annoyance. Sam now chases Bugs again, and is now subjected to the famous lots- of-doors in-and-out routine (previously used in Little Red Riding Rabbit), which ends with Sam getting blasted by a cannon again. Sam confronts Bugs, who throws a match into the powder room, which a panicking Sam swiftly retrieves (a gag that would later be recycled into 1954's Captain Hareblower). This is repeated until finally, Sam is too late to retrieve the match that ends up exploding the entire pirate ship when he refused to go after another match again, reducing the ship to splinters. On his last nerve, Sam furiously chases Bugs with his gun: \\"ooooh, I'll blast your head off for this!\\" until he seemingly has Bugs defeated (\\"Alright, now! I got ya cornered! Come out and meet your doom!\\") until a cannon blasts him once more. Finally, defeated, Sam raises the white flag. Bugs turns to the audience, puts on an old-style ship captain's hat, and paraphrases John Paul Jones, \\"I have not even begun to fight!\\" and he laughs.

Ascena also owns Justice, Lane Bryant, and Catherines clothing store brands, and is the parent company of Ann Inc., operator of Ann Taylor and Loft stores. Chairman Emeritus Elliot Jaffe and his wife and co-founder, Roslyn own about 25% of Ascena. History The first Dressbarn was opened in February 1962 in Stamford, Connecticut, by Roslyn Jaffe. Jaffe saw the opportunity to provide wear-to-work dresses and clothing for the working woman during a time when women were entering the workforce in greater numbers. The company began trading on NASDAQ (symbol DBRN) in 1982. In January 2011, to reflect its broader holdings, the company was reorganized as a Delaware corporation named Ascena Retail Group, Inc. The company's NASDAQ symbol also changed to ASNA in 2011. Dress Barn, Green Oak Village Place In 2005, Ascena Retail Group acquired Maurices Inc. from American Retail Group.

Page is an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music, in the Music Industry program.[21] He is currently CEO of Think:EXP, a Los Angeles-based media company focused on live immersive entertainment. Page worked on and led a number of ventures, including Walt Tucker Productions, an audio video post production company that produced projects for The Rolling Stones, Bon Jovi, Janet Jackson, Garth Brooks, Scorpions and others. Page co-founded 7th Level, Inc., a CD-ROM game and educational software company where he co-produced Tuneland, an interactive musical cartoon (starring Howie Mandel and featuring David Gilmour), the Monty Python interactive series, and was integral to the development of QD7, an interactive multimedia joint venture with Quincy Jones and David Salzman that resulted from Jones' partnering with the company. Page co-founded New Media Broadcasting Company, a social media and collaborative communications enterprise and co-founded and served as CEO of Direct2Care, an online healthcare presence management company. Before his most recent venture with Think:EXP, Page had co-founded GetYourOPI, an online presence management company and served as CEO of Ignited Network, \\"a start up music accelerator based in Los Angeles.\\" As an artist, his continued work as a recording and as a session musician continues to draw interest from Pink Floyd fans and other music fans alike. Early life Scott Page is the son of musician Bill Page, best known for his work as a reed player and member of the Lawrence Welk Band. He was also a fixture with The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Scott Page's earliest nationally broadcast musical performance was on television network American Broadcasting Company's (ABC's) Lawrence Welk Show; he played trumpet, in an appearance with his father, Bill Page, on the December 24th, 1960 Christmas special (season five, episode 15). As a young adult, Page was cast in The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries and in The Young and the Restless. Page was featured in the April 10th, 1977 The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries episode titled \\"The Mystery of the Flying Courier,\\" playing the part of a musician in character Joe Hardy's band. On The Young and the Restless he played a musician, a member of characters Lauren Fenmore and Danny Romalotti's band; the episode aired on May 14, 1986. Music Following his musical performances on the Lawrence Welk Show as a child, Page played in studio projects for Geronimo Black, The Alpha Band, and the Ladd McIntosh Big Band in his early adult years. Page played oboe on the self-titled Geronimo Black album. He came to prominence, however, on Supertramp's 1983 ... Famous Last Words ... Tour. Following that tour, Page would then go on to record with Supertramp on their 1985 album Brother Where You Bound. He played flute on the album. That production would become his first artistic intersection with Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour, who also played on the album. =Supertramp= Scott Page joined Supertramp in support of the ... Famous Last Words ... Tour (1983). It marked the first time additional musicians would join Supertramp as touring band members. The tour also featured Fred Mandel among the added personnel. During that tour, Scott Page was also occasionally playing the guitar and the flute. In addition to his instrumental work on the tour, Page provided vocals, e.g., on the live version of the hit It's Raining Again, John Helliwell and Page sang the lower harmonies while Roger Hodgson sang higher harmonies. Page's tenure with Supertramp was embedded in a transitional period for the band. The tour marked the first time Hodgson spoke to the audience during shows, thanking fans and announcing his forthcoming departure from the band. It was Supertramp's most ambitious tour, filling stadiums around the world and elevating Page's status as a recognizable figure in his own right. Following the successful ... Famous Last Words ... Tour, Page stayed with Supertramp, entering the studio with the band and performing live with them through the album and tour for Brother Where You Bound (1985-1986). He then did studio work on the follow-up album, Free as a Bird (1987). During that time, Page was also balancing work with Toto. =Toto= In 1985 Scott Page had the opportunity to tour with Toto (between the end of Supertramp's ... Famous Last Words ... Tour and the band's return to the studio for work on Brother Where You Bound). This was a promotional tour for Toto's album Isolation. The 1985 leg of the tour spanned February through May of that year and two dates in April 1986. In 1986, Page was approached by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour for work on an upcoming album by the band's new incarnation following Roger Waters' departure in 1985. He was invited to record parts for what would become the track \\"Dogs of War\\" on the A Momentary Lapse of Reason album.Pink Floyd: A Momentary Lapse of Reason Songbook U.K. He would eventually be asked to join the band on its extensive A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, marking the end of his stints with Toto and Supertramp. =Pink Floyd= As Pink Floyd prepared for their first tour in a new incarnation, Gilmour and Mason began looking for musicians that could add a combination of musical skills and \\"showmanship\\" in an effort to put across more energy in the band's stage show. Page was hired and immediately joined the band in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for rehearsals. Page played for the duration of the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour with the exception of the band's last performance under that tour's umbrella: an isolated, special performance at Knebworth Park on June 30, 1990. Despite being cast as part of the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, the Knebworth Park date took place nearly one year after the preceding tour date and included a number of guest musicians that were not part of the band's regular recording and touring team. Mason referred to Scott Page as \\"another stage show in his own right.\\" Page \\"would be rendered instantly recognizable to fans in even the cheapest stadium seats by his lavish mullet hairstyle.\\" As Pink Floyd historian Mark Blake illustrates in Pigs Might Fly: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd, the band was specifically looking to add \\"the presence of younger and more flamboyant band members\\" and Page was a good fit with his \\"elaborately coiffured\\" look and a willingness to participate to the fullest extent possible in the band's live performance (often adding the texture of an additional rhythm guitar between saxophone performances). Producer Bob Ezrin would later state that Page \\"came with the territory;\\" the band meant for it \\"to be a more visual show.\\" He is featured in the television documentary and live concert Pink Floyd in Venice and the Pink Floyd Delicate Sound of Thunder concert film, both which document the band's A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. Delicate Sound of Thunder was also released as an album. Page is also featured in additional recordings that were originally intended for release in what would have become the Delicate Sound of Thunder concert film and Delicate Sound of Thunder live album, including live material from Atlanta, Georgia, recorded at the Omni Coliseum in November 1987; unhappy with the results, the band used footage recorded the following year at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York for what would become Delicate Sound of Thunder: the abandoned Atlanta material circulates widely as a video and an audio bootleg titled Pink Floyd: The Calhoun Tapes and Would You Buy a Ticket to This Show. Another performance that circulates widely in several bootleg versions is the live Italian and worldwide broadcast of the band's performance on a barge, on the Grand Canal in Venice in July 1989. It was during his time in Pink Floyd that Page began to transition into entrepreneurial endeavors and began to divide his time between his music and his business careers. =Post-Pink Floyd music career= Page, performing at the Temecula Valley International Film Festival with Hang Dynasty in 2014. Despite his current focus on business endeavors, Page continues to play live and as a session musician. After his tenure with Pink Floyd, Page has continued recording with artists as diverse as David Cassidy, Gorky Park, Bob Malone, Eddie Zip, Mickey Raphael, David Lee Roth, Jane's Addiction, and Seth Loveless; he has also played as a guest on a number of Pink Floyd tribute albums. Along with Supertramp member Carl Verheyen, he is also a founding member of Hang Dynasty, a band that brings together \\"sidemen\\" from larger bands and whose membership includes a rotating cast of musicians. In addition to Page and Verheyen, musicians that play or have played with the band include Jeff Baxter, Ray Brinker, Kal David, Mike Finnigan, Steve Madaio, Ricky Peterson, Leland Sklar, Edgar Winter, Dave Woodford, Kenny Lee Lewis and Billy Peterson, and Stephen Kupka and Lee Thornburg. The band has also performed with guests musicians including Kenny Aronoff, Reggie McBride, and Dianne Steinberg-Lewis. In September 2014, Hang Dynasty headlined the final night of the Temecula Valley International Film Festival. The band's special guest was honoree Alan Parsons. On June 17, 2015, Page made a surprise guest appearance during Brit Floyd's concert at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California. He played Money and Us and Them with Brit Floyd during his guest appearance. Business: technologist and entrepreneurship Through his various business and artistic ventures, Page has served as a video game music producer for the Ace Ventura video game and The Lion King franchise's Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games video game, as a composer for the movie Three Kinds of Heat, and as a supervising producer for Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time video game. =Walt Tucker Productions= Although Page made a fuller transition into technology entrepreneurship in the computer software industry in 1993 (after founding 7th Level), effectively culminating any potential commitments with Pink Floyd, he had already founded a Los Angeles based audio and video post- production company in 1987 called Walt Tucker Productions (specifically, headquartered in Glendale, California). He led and managed Walt Tucker Productions even while recording and touring with Pink Floyd. The two efforts overlapped during production of the \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" album and the subsequent, promotional A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. Walt Tucker specialized in CD/ROM technology and derived its name from an amalgamation of two of Page's \\"heroes\\": Walt Disney and Preston Tucker. A few years into his tenure as president of Walt Tucker Productions, during a visit to COMDEX in the fall of 1992, Page talked about being at a crossroads with respect to the balance he was beginning to strike between his role as a musician and his role as an entrepreneur and businessman. In an interview with Joseph Panettieri, of Information Week, Page discussed \\"getting to a point where [he would] have to make a decision about what [he wanted] to dedicate [his] time to.\\" He added: \\"I've done my music stint. Building an interactive multimedia company is my next challenge. I'm more concerned now about the multimedia business.\\" Despite this, he would also state that (at the time) Pink Floyd may commit to another world tour and that he would find it difficult to \\"sit that... out.\\" A special Pink Floyd performance at Knebworth Park on June 30, 1990 (in Stevenage, England) included a number of guest musicians that were not part of the band's regular recording and touring roster. At this event, which is considered the band's last performance on the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, Candy Dulfer played saxophone. Pink Floyd would not tour again until 1994, at which point Page was fully immersed in business endeavors and limiting his music work to studio sessions and some selected live performances. Ultimately, this would cement Page's performance with Pink Floyd on the penultimate date of the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour (July 18, of 1989) in Marseille, France, at the Stade V√©lodrome, as his last with the band. Saxophonist Dick Parry, who had last recorded with Pink Floyd in 1975, during the Wish You Were Here album production effort and last toured with the band in 1977 during the In The Flesh Tour, rejoined the band for the recording of The Division Bell album as well as The Division Bell Tour that followed. Page's new focus on entrepreneurship did not mean an end to his partnership with members of the Pink Floyd coterie: Page continued working with Walt Tucker Productions until joining forces with Pink Floyd producer Bob Ezrin to create a new business venture in 1993. =7th Level= In 1993, Page formed 7th Level, Inc. with music/entertainment producer Bob Ezrin and Dallas, Texas technology entrepreneur George Grayson, whose first company (Micrografx, Inc.) pioneered PC-based graphics software development in the early 1980s. The company's first software venture was an edutainment product called \\"Li'l Howie's TuneLand\\" starring comedian and \\"Deal Or No Deal\\" host Howie Mandel. \\"Tuneland\\" featured musical performances by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, Yes vocalist/songwriter Jon Anderson, Steely Dan/Doobie Brothers guitarist Jeff 'Skunk' Baxter and other popular musicians on such children's songs as \\"The Little Green Frog.\\" 7th Level's flagship product was a CD-ROM software 'edutainment thingie' called \\"Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time.\\" It was produced in 1994 by British comedy troupe's animator and award-winning film director Terry Gilliam, and Ezrin. \\"Waste Of Time\\" included such elements as 'The Desktop Pythonizer' and 'Solve The Secret To Intergalactic Success.' The product included video clips from the absurdist icons' seminal BBC-TV series \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\" as well as new animation from Gilliam. =New Media Broadcasting Company= In 2004, Page launched New Media Broadcasting Company Inc. (NewMBC) www.newmbc.com with silicon valley technology veteran Russ Lujan. Initially NewMBC developed interactive distribution services for content creators and consumers. Its MashCast communications platform connected diverse audiences, artists, content owners through a collaborative online network. Mashcast helped users integrate and monetize Internet broadcasts and social networks, using an infrastructure that supported content creation and collaboration. NewMBC's most highly visible clients have included fan-based community sites for the international, Grammy-winning musical group Toto, as well as for Python (Monty) Ltd. =Direct2Care= In 2011, Page launched and served as chief executive officer of Direct2Care, an online healthcare presence management company. Direct2Care shared traits with New Media Broadcasting Company in its effort to leverage website and social media presence for its clients: it provided a \\"social business and presence management network for healthcare professionals.\\" =GetYourOPI= In 2014 Page launched GetYourOPI, an online presence management company: an endeavor focused on improving cyberspace presence for individuals and entities through analysis of their existing results on search engines. GetYourOPI \\"measures\\" and \\"manages\\" capabilities for these. This \\"online presence\\" is measured by the company through an index factoring the volume of cyberspace presence and its translation into \\"social influence,\\" producing a score whereby the company tackles its management consultation. It provides its clients with a \\"track, manage, and follow\\" service that expands their ability to control what they project online with greater scrutiny. Philanthropy Page has initiated several notable charity fundraising benefit events, concerts, recordings, film, video, and online projects. In November 1992 he created \\"The Grand Scientific Musical Theatre,\\" a multimedia concert and fundraiser held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada (as part of COMDEX/Fall, the computer industry's largest trade show) to benefit the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. This was produced in conjunction with Micrografx, as an adjunct to the company's annual Chili Cook- Off, which tapped computer industry leaders such as Microsoft and IBM, as well as media organizations such as CMP, IDG and Ziff-Davis to sponsor and donate to selected nonprofit organizations. For that one-time/one-night event, he produced live as well as audio/video/film-recorded performances by a wide variety of entertainers, including: the Cirque du Soleil, Todd Rundgren, producer Alan Parsons, The Turtles, Jon Anderson, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Graham Nash, John Entwistle, and James Burton, as well as the Tower Of Power, Edgar Winter, Jim Keltner, guitarist Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter and others.

The album was packaged in an intentionally confusing manner, with the 'Eastern' and 'Western' titles reversed on the cover, the same label on both sides and a sticker on early pressings apologizing for there only being two mantras (despite the title) and explaining that the album was being priced as a single to make up for it. The reversed vocal that runs all the way through 'Eastern Mantra' is the name of another Sheffield electronic band - The Human League.

Despite its name, it is not a true finch, but rather a member of the large family Passerellidae, which also includes American sparrows, juncos and towhees. It is the only member of the genus Pezopetes. This is a common bird in the undergrowth of mountain forests, second growth, bamboo clumps, and scrubby pastures from 2150 m altitude to the scrubby p√°ramo at 3350 m. It is readily seen in favoured sites such as Cerro de la Muerte. The nest, built by the female, is a large loose cup of plant material placed less than 2 m up in bamboo or a dense shrub. The typical clutch is one or two brown-marked white or blue-white eggs, which are incubated by the female alone for 12‚Äì14 days before hatching. The large-footed finch is a large, robust terrestrial species, long and weighing . It has a slender bill, a modestly sized tail and very large and powerful feet and legs. This species is one of the heaviest in its diverse family.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . The adult has a slate grey head, becoming black on the throat, forehead and crown sides. The upper parts are dark olive and the wings and tail are black with olive fringes. The underparts are bright olive with a brown tint to the flanks and lower belly. Young birds have a streaked dark olive head, blackish scaling to the upperparts, and buff-olive underparts . The large-footed finch has a thin seet call, and the male's song, given from the ground or a low perch, consists of a mix or whistles, warbles, chatter and mimicry. The large-footed finch feeds on insects, spiders, and seeds, extracted from the leaf litter with powerful double scratches that can send debris flying up to 30 cm.

This conflict ended with the defeat of the liberal forces and the approval of a new constitution in 1833, that was in force until 1925.  Background  The resignation and self-exile of General Bernardo O'Higgins in 1823 did not put an end to the political infighting. Civil conflict continued, focusing mainly on the issues of anticlericalism and regionalism. Presidents and constitutions rose and fell quickly in the 1820s. The Chilean political scene divided itself into two groups that were already embrionary during the independence days. The followers of O'Higgins became the Conservatives or Bigwigs (). This group was mainly composed by the remains of the colonial aristocracy, and defended the ideas of a strong central government, respect of tradition and a strong support for the Catholic Church. Their most prominent leaders were Jos√© Gregorio Argomedo, Juan Ega√±a and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto. Opposed to them were the Liberals or Pipiolos. This group was mainly composed of the followers of Jos√© Miguel Carrera, and were strongly influenced by the European liberal ideas. They defended a more free and democratic government, without interference from the Church. Their leaders were Ram√≥n Freire, Manuel Borgo√±o and Francisco Antonio Pinto. The Conservatives and the Liberals, began to coalesce around the church-state issue. Not only more favorably inclined toward the church, the Conservatives were also more sympathetic than the Liberals toward the colonial legacy, authoritarian government, the supremacy of executive powers, and a unitary state. Together with these two political tendencies, which in time developed into the two main political parties of the 19th century, there were also some minority groups. One of them was the Federalist Party under the leadership of Jos√© Miguel Infante, who promoted a model of government based on the one adopted by the United States. Another group was the Estanqueros or Monopolists (estanco means monopoly), a very heterogeneous political group under the leadership of Diego Portales. The name came out of the fact that most of them were merchants, and their leader, Portales, was in charge of the tobacco monopoly. Their principal figures were Juan Francisco Meneses (ex-monarchist); Manuel Jos√© Gandarillas (Carrera supporter) and Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez Aldea (O'Higgins supporter).  Constitutional essays  The time between 1823 and 1828 is called of the Constitutional Essays. The first of these three essays is the Moralist system (1823) of Juan Ega√±a, which created a unitary state, democratic (with the franchise restricted to men of the upper classes) and Catholic. The executive power was in the hands of a Supreme Director, elected for four years and to be reelected only once. This system was no sooner in place when it came under attack from the proponents of a federalist system. The abolition of slavery in this constitution ‚Äì long before most other countries in the Americas ‚Äì is considered one of the liberals' few lasting achievements. In their impatience, the Federalist leaders forced Congress to adopt some laws giving federal rights to the provinces. In 1825, Jos√© Miguel Infante was President of the Directorial Council that was in charge of the administration while Supreme Director Freire was away capturing Chilo√© from Royalist forces. Using their position, the councillors created the eight Provincial Assemblies that would become the basis for the federal system. The eight provinces were: Coquimbo, Aconcagua, Santiago, Colchagua, Maule, Concepci√≥n, Valdivia and Chilo√©. The second essay thus was the Federalist written by Infante in 1826, though it was never formally adopted. = Election of 1826 = On July 14, 1826 Congress passed a law calling for a new election. The Supreme Director was to be replaced by a President. The first elected president was Manuel Blanco Encalada, who, with 59.5% of the vote and 22 electoral votes, defeated Jos√© Miguel Infante who only obtained 40.5% of the vote and 15 electoral votes. For the position of vice president Agust√≠n Eyzaguirre, with 57.1% of the vote and 20 electoral votes, defeated Francisco Antonio Pinto who received 42.9% of the vote and 15 electoral votes. The system very quickly proved to be a failure. Blanco Encalada resigned, and was replaced by Eyzaguirre in 1827. He in turn was deposed by colonel Enrique Campino Salamanca, who called back general Ram√≥n Freire. = Constitution of 1828 = The first (of many) measures of the new government was to call for a constitutional convention. Congress confirmed the return of General Freire and proceeded to dissolve itself. Immediately after, Freire resigned and was replaced by his vice-president Francisco Antonio Pinto. In August 1828, Pinto's first year in office, Chile abandoned its short-lived federalist system for a unitary form of government, with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The new constitution was finalized in 1828 by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Mora together with Melchor Santiago Concha. This became the third or Liberal essay. The government became a unitary system, but maintained the eight Provincial Assemblies created by the federalist essay. The executive was in the hands of a President, elected for five years who was prohibited from running for re-election. By adopting a moderately liberal constitution in 1828, Pinto alienated both the Federalists and the Liberal factions. He also angered the old aristocracy by abolishing estates inherited by primogeniture and caused a public uproar with his anticlericalism. =Election of 1829= It was not a military incident which caused the revolution, but a mere political disagreement that led to anarchy. A new presidential election was called in 1829. The clear winner (out of 9 candidates) was General Francisco Antonio Pinto, liberal and already Provisional President since the resignation of Freire in 1827, with 118 electoral votes and 29.1% of the vote. The problem happened with the vice presidential election. The winner should have been the first runner-up, Francisco Ruiz-Tagle with 98 electoral votes or 24.1% of the vote, or the second runner-up, General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto, with 61 votes or 15.0% of the vote, both conservatives. Nonetheless, Congress was controlled by the Liberals and presided over by Francisco Ram√≥n Vicu√±a, also Liberal. Arguing that no vice-presidential candidate had a majority, they selected Joaqu√≠n Vicu√±a, brother of the President of the Senate, even though he only got 48 electoral votes (11.8% 9f the vote). That was the pretext for the conservatives to rebel.  Revolution of 1829  The Liberal leader par excellence, General Ram√≥n Freire, rode in and out of the presidency several times (1823‚Äì27, 1828, 1829, 1830) but could not sustain his authority. From May 1827 to September 1831, with the exception of brief interventions by Freire, the presidency was occupied by General Francisco Antonio Pinto, Freire's former vice president. The conservative side was under the military leadership of General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto and the political guidance of Diego Portales, while the liberal side was under the command of Ram√≥n Freire and Francisco de la Lastra. President Pinto promptly resigned on July 14, handing acting presidential duties not to the vice president but rather to that man's brother, the President of the Senate Francisco Ram√≥n Vicu√±a. On December 7, 1829 conservative troops under General Prieto approached Santiago from the South, this army having been assembled largely through the efforts of Prieto's cousin, Manuel Bulnes. The conservative army decided to halt the march for a while and camped a few miles outside the city. The government under President Vicu√±a immediately collapsed and they fled first to Valpara√≠so and then northward to Coquimbo. On December 14, 1829, General Prieto and his troops met the liberal army under Francisco de la Lastra and defeated them in the Battle of Ochagav√≠a. Meanwhile, President Vicu√±a and his ministers were captured and imprisoned by the victorious conservative troops. Chile was without a leader for a few weeks (from December 7 to 24, 1829). After the Battle of Ochagav√≠a, General Freire agreed to a cease-fire with Prieto. A Government Junta was organized and took control, in order to avoid the continuance of hostilities, under the neutral figure Jos√© Tom√°s Ovalle, who was acceptable to both sides. This junta ruled the country from December 24, 1829 to February 18, 1830. Power was retained by Ram√≥n Freire who organized a liberal convention with the intention of calling for new general elections and the formation of a new Congress. At the same time, the conservatives who were in control of Santiago also called for their own convention, where an agreement was reached which nominated Francisco Ruiz-Tagle as acting president. Immediately that Ruiz- Tagle took over as president, the principal leaders of the Liberal side (Manuel Borgo√±o, Francisco de la Lastra and Juan Gregorio de las Heras) were eliminated from the army rosters. This guaranteed the restart of the hostilities. President Ruiz-Tagle and all the cabinet resigned on April 1, and Jos√© Tom√°s Ovalle, as vice president assumed power. The last engagement happened at the Battle of Lircay, near Talca, on April 17, 1830. The liberals were totally routed, and their leader, General Ram√≥n Freire, was exiled first to Peru and then to Tahiti. Later in life he was allowed to return to Chile, but he never participated in politics again. Due to the chaotic situation nobody wanted to participate in the government, so President Ovalle named Diego Portales as his universal minister. Portales took over the running of the government bringing with him the political ideas that were to shape Chile for the rest of the century. After the defeat at the Battle of Lircay, the Liberal side finally decided to negotiate and signed the Treaty of Cuz-Cuz, that brought an end to the anarchy and their political dominance and ushered 30 years of conservative governments.

This unit was under the command of Ove Lund, and is the origin of the modern Minedykkerkommandoen and Marinejegerkommandoen. The mission of the frogmen was to conduct re-con and sabotage against enemy targets above and below water. The frogmen were also tasked with disarming all water-born explosive devices. The missions gradually become more comprehensive and different frogman specialities emerged. This led to members of the unit being divided into a clearance diver team and two combat swimmer teams, in 1968. = Selection and training = General selection separates out those who do not have physical and mental abilities to start the clearance diver course. A candidate must contest a strength test, fitness test and a water stress test. After passing the general selection, an applicant attends the main selection, performed in the winter. It comprises physical and mental exercises with little food and little sleep. Few of those who enter get through. Following selection, the potential operator starts basic training for 12 months at the Norwegian Navy diver and frogman school, Dykker og Froskemannskolen. This training involves all basic disciplines required to serve as a clearance diver. After training, the candidates who are eligible for operational service are transferred to MDK, to become an EOD operator.

His voting record indicated that he was the most conservative member of the House Democratic Caucus in the 111th Congress. District 2 includes just over half of the state capital, Montgomery, as well as most of the Wiregrass Region in the southeastern part of the state. Bright is a native of the Wiregrass Region and has 13 siblings. He is the first Mayor of Montgomery to be elected to Congress. In November 2010, he was defeated for a second term in the U.S. House by Republican nominee Martha Roby, a then Montgomery City Council member. In 2018, Bright attempted to run for his old House of Representatives seat as a Republican, but was defeated in the primaries by Roby. Early life, education, and early career Bright was born in Midland City, Alabama and grew up on one of the cotton farms that were typical of the Wiregrass Region.Bobby Bright profile at CQ Politics Bright grew up the son of a sharecropper, with 13 other siblings. After spending his youth working on the farm and graduating from high school, he took a job in metalworking to save up money for college. Bright worked each and every day to pay for his education. He later graduated from Auburn University with a B.A. in political science in 1975 and took a job as an auditor before earning an M.S. in criminal justice from Troy State University in 1977 and beginning a career as a corrections officer. While working in the prison system, he was deeply affected by the many young people he saw entering the penitentiaries and decided to transition into law practice as a result. Bright received his Juris Doctor from the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law at Faulkner University in 1982. He practiced law for fifteen years before entering into politics. Mayor of Montgomery Bright was first elected in 1999, defeating longtime incumbent Republican Mayor Emory Folmar. He was re-elected in a landslide against challenger Scott Simmons in 2003. During Mayor Bright's tenure he revitalized Montgomery's downtown and riverfront including the Renaissance Montgomery complex and Montgomery Riverwalk Stadium. He helped bring new jobs to the area, and saved existing jobs. He was also named the state's \\"Tourism Advocate of the Year\\" by the Governor for his work in building that industry. On the financial side, he balanced the City's budget every year and created a $30 million rainy day fund, secured millions in federal grants for important projects, maintained the city's \\"AA\\" credit rating (best in state) by holding spending and debt in check, and saved money by implementing an international prescription drug buying program.Alabama's 2nd District DCCC U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= ;2008 Mayor Bright had never previously claimed affiliation with any party, but in 2008 he announced that he was running as a Democrat for the open seat in the 2nd District.

This resolution reorganized public job training funds, directing them towards flexible skills and credentials recognized by industries. Also called the American Manufacturing Efficiency and Retraining Investment Collaboration Act (AMERICA Works), the bill was targeted at new workers just entering the workforce and servicemen and women returning to civilian life. Because of his dedication to small business, Bright requested a waiver to serve on the House Small Business Committee shortly after his arrival in Washington. The first bill sponsored by Bright would eventually be included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which became law on February 17, 2009. After the defection of fellow Alabama Democrat Parker Griffith to the Republican Party in December 2009, political analyst and statistician Nate Silver suggested that Bright could follow, naming \\"60/40\\" odds that he would eventually join the Republican caucus as well. The day after Griffith's party switch, Bright told media that he had no intention of switching parties and would remain a Democrat. The National Journal named Bright the most conservative Democrat during the first session of the 111th United States Congress.

The College also operated as a boarding school until its boarding facilities were closed in 2011. The College was named after Lourdes in France, where Mary is said to have appeared to a young girl named Bernadette Soubirous. It was founded in 1916 by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan of the Order of Saint Benedict, and currently caters for approximately 970 students from Years 8 to 12 (12 to 18 years of age), which included 70 boarders. Lourdes Hill is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), and the Brisbane Schoolgirls Sporting Association (BSGSA). The school is one of eleven colleges incorporated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. The school was previously affiliated with the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA).  History  Lourdes Hill College traces its origins to 1915, when the Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig, invited the Sisters of the Good Samaritan to establish schools in Brisbane. Subsequently, that same year, thirteen Sisters travelled from Sydney opening convents at Bulimba and Coorparoo. Archbishop Duhig offered the sisters one of the choicest sites in Brisbane for a convent and a secondary girls' school. Lourdes Hill College was established in January 1916, with Mother Berchmans and thirteen sisters sailing up the river on the ship \\"Osterley\\" and docking at the site. The College was named after Lourdes in France, where Mary is said to have appeared to a young girl named Bernadette Soubirous. When the Good Samaritan Sisters were setting up the school, Archbishop Duhig commented that the site reminded him of Lourdes.  Campus  Lourdes Hill College is situated on the Bulimba Reach of the Brisbane River in suburban Hawthorne, across the river from New Farm Park. The campus is from the Brisbane central business district. = Boarding = The aim of the College Boarding House was to provide a homely environment.

The Yadavas and Chauhans were the last dynasties to perform a coronation ritual, but whether they performed Indrabhishek ceremony is not clear. Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, revived the Indrabhishek tradition. Pandit Gaga Bhatt, who presided over his coronation ceremony, wrote a detailed book on the procedure. A thread ceremony, Upanayana, of Shivaji took place on May 29, 1674, and then a Vratya Stoma ceremony was performed.

History The seminary was founded by John Williams, then coadjutor bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut, as a mediating alternative between the Anglo-Catholic‚Äìleaning General Theological Seminary in New York and the evangelical-leaning Virginia Theological Seminary. The name of the seminary alludes to the vision of philosopher and bishop George Berkeley who a century earlier had planned a seminary in the western hemisphere; this use of his name for an educational institution precedes its association with California by some decades. Williams was also president of Trinity College in Hartford. After a brief period where he oversaw instruction as part of the college, the school began independent life in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1854. Williams continued as dean while succeeding as diocesan bishop until his death in 1899. Berkeley moved to New Haven in 1928, during the deanship of noted liturgical scholar William Palmer Ladd, to take advantage of the resources of Yale University. In 1971, a new agreement between Yale and Berkeley resulted in a closer affiliation; since then all students of Berkeley Divinity School have been also students of Yale Divinity School and take a Yale degree. Approximately one third of Yale Divinity School's students undertaking the master's degree in divinity are members of Berkeley. Thus, Berkeley operates as a denominational seminary within an ecumenical divinity school. Students graduating from Berkeley Divinity School at Yale earn a Diploma in Anglican Studies from Berkeley as well as their Yale degree, certifying that they have received education specific to preparation for holy orders in the Episcopal Church. Berkeley's offices and programs are centered with those of Yale Divinity School on the Sterling Divinity Quadrangle, although Berkeley also maintains a separate center for worship and some programs at the nearby Berkeley Center. Its former New Haven campus is now the site of Pauli Murray College, one of the newer residential colleges of Yale University, named for an Episcopal priest and activist.

Celso Charuri in Brazil, proposes to guide those interested in the development of the human potential, promoting courses in which, according to him, \\"subjects within the mental, physical and spiritual spheres are discussed and analyzed\\".Pr√≥-Vida Official Site: Objective According to its founder, the development of this potential gives the human being better conditions for attaining their objectives. Through mental training, it would be possible for man to amplify his consciousness, reaching a state that would allow them a differential action in the environment in which they act. After beginning activities in the city of S√£o Paulo, at present PRO-VIDA has participating nuclei in various other Brazilian towns and in other countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Italy, Mexico, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and the United States of America, besides four country clubs: three in Brazil and one in Argentina. Its main public manifestation is linked to the Social Responsibility sector. Though its Central Geral do D√≠zimo PR√ì-VIDA (General Central for the Tithe PR√ì-VIDA), a non-profit organization, donates to charities such as day care centers, elderly care institutions, orphanages and institutions that offer treatment and education for disabled children. CGD also builds vocational schools. According to statistics of the institution, more than 7,000 charities have already benefitted from these donations. The content of its courses is not revealed publicly and participants are quite discreet as to their activities. This secrecy gives the institution an air of mystery that makes people curious about its inner workings. This encouraged a well-known women's magazine to publish an article in November 1996 O Enigma da Pir√¢mide: Por Dentro do Pr√≥-Vida published by brazilian version of women's magazine Marie Claire, n¬∞ 68, November 1996 - Article copy at site atheists.net - not checked against the original article. containing strong criticism against PR√ì-VIDA. According to it, PR√ì-VIDA aimed exclusively at profits, the contents of its courses were pseudo-scientific and the criteria for evaluating participants were not very clear. HistoryNewsletter Pr√≥-Vida - October 2000. PR√ì-VIDA began in 1978, in the district of Moema, in S√£o Paulo city, when Dr. Celso created Pr√≥-Mente, where he himself gave courses about mental development and training. In the following year, PR√ì-VIDA Integra√ß√£o C√≥smica (Cosmic Integration) was created. In 1979, the Central Geral do D√≠zimo was founded, and started to donate to various charities. The Clube de Campo PR√ì-VIDA (PR√ì-VIDA Country Club) was created in 1980, in Ara√ßoiaba da Serra county, near Sorocaba, in the interior of S√£o Paulo State. By the end of 1981, year of the death of its creator and founder, Dr. Celso Charuri, PR√ì-VIDA had more than 12,000 students. In 1989, PR√ì-VIDA started promoting courses away from its headquarters, in various cities in S√£o Paulo state and also in Minas Gerais state. In 1990, the first course outside Brazil was promoted, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where in 1995 the headquarters of PR√ì-VIDA were established and in 1997, a Country Club in the Buenos Aires Province. Following Argentina, at least six other countries promotes courses of PR√ì-VIDA nowadays: Bolivia, Chile, Italy, Mexico, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and the United States of America. In 1996, PR√ì-VIDA moved its S√£o Paulo headquarters to the district of Alto de Pinheiros. As of 1998, participants who lived outside S√£o Paulo city started to get together to create PR√ì-VIDA chapters in their own towns. Presently, PR√ì-VIDA has tens of nuclei of participants in various Brazilian cities as well as abroad. Courses The PR√ì-VIDA courses are organized in nine stages. Each one of the first three, called Basic, Advanced 1, and Introduction, last for a week. According to the institution, in these courses \\"themes within the mental, physical and spiritual spheres\\" are discussed and analyzed. The courses are given by instructors trained among the students, some of which had been students under Dr. Celso Charuri. In the Basic course, various themes about the properties of the brain are touched, such as sleep and dreams, levels of brain function and brain frequencies and also such themes as energy, aura and pyramids. Besides, courses include a practical part where one can train methods of relaxation and mental visualization. Central Geral do D√≠zimo The Central Geral do D√≠zimo PR√ì-VIDA (CGD), a non-economic organization, acknowledged as a \\"public utility charity institution\\", in municipal, state and federal jurisdiction, donates to charities such as hospitals, day care centers, elderly care, orphanages and institutions that offer treatment and education for disabled children. According to statistics published by the institution, more than 7,000 entities have already benefitted, receiving vehicles, ambulances, building material, hospital and medical equipment and supplies, and complete workshops, among other items. The funds for the Central Geral do D√≠zimo are gathered through anonymous bank deposits. The money obtained - except for a yearly tax for the functioning charged by the S√£o Paulo city administration - is totally donated to charities, and this can be verified in the yearly audit reports, by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, available in the institution's web site. Besides, CGD has agreements with SENAI and the Paula Souza Foundation. Through these agreements, CGD builds vocational schools and equips them completely - including furniture, industrial machinery, tools, computers, etc. - and hands them over to those entities, which from then on administer them pedagogically and administratively.Vocational schools donated by Central Geral do D√≠zimo (in Portuguese).

According to rules published by the organization, \\"the charities awarded by Central Geral do D√≠zimo are previously analyzed, and must show reliability, and be in recognized and actual operation, in addition to being regulated at the proper authorities\\". Country Club Clube de Campo PR√ì-VIDA is an independent institution, that works just as any other social club, in which access is for members only, in this case, some participants of PR√ì-VIDA who become members voluntarily. This club was created with the objective of stimulating and deepening the interaction among PR√ì-VIDA participants. In these places, cultural, social and athletic activities are promoted. At present, there are four units: Clube de Campo PR√ì-VIDA, in Ara√ßoiaba da Serra, S√£o Paulo State, Clube de Campo PR√ì-VIDA das Arauc√°rias, in Paran√° State, Clube de Campo PRO-VIDA de Paragua√ßu, in Minas Gerais State and Club de Campo PR√ì-VIDA de Baradero, in Argentina. Controversies The discreet way that PR√ì-VIDA has adopted for its activities and its courses, in its 30 years of existence, has aroused curiosity and generated polemics in some environments. There are no records of any public announcements made by the organization, which seems to be averse to publicity. Its only public manifestation is through the Central Geral do D√≠zimo. In 1996, the Brazilian version of women's magazine Marie Claire had a journalist take a PR√ì-VIDA course and then report her experience. In this story some issues were raised that have been serving as reference material for critics of the institution. According to the report, the institute would aim mainly for profit: besides the courses being paid for, the Central Geral do D√≠zimo and the Clube de Campo would be additional forms of revenue. The journalist also claims that the contents of the PR√ì-VIDA courses would be pseudo-scientific and would use well-established scientific concepts in a twisted way, removing them from their original context, to try to prove its theories and justify the existence of paranormal phenomena. After the conclusion of the fundamental courses, to gain access to more advanced courses, it is necessary to be submitted to an evaluation. The report relates cases of participants who remained for more than ten years in this process and have never been approved for the subsequent stages. Still according to the report, the Clube de Campo accepts as members only PR√ì-VIDA participants and when a member, who may also have a cottage in the club, stops being a participant of PR√ì-VIDA, they are invited to withdraw their membership and gets less money in return than the amount originally paid. It seems to be a policy of PR√ì-VIDA not to defend itself publicly from any kind of criticism, keeping its activities independent.

As is standard in Chinese, the same name \\"Youzhou\\" was also often used to describe the prefectural seat or provincial capital from which the area was administered. You was first created in 106 BC as a province-sized prefecture during the Western Han Dynasty to administer a large swath of the dynasty's northern frontier that stretched from modern-day Shanxi Province in the west and Shandong Province in the south, through northeastern Hebei Province, southern Liaoning Province and southern Inner Mongolia to Korea. The prefectural capital was the City of Ji in modern Beijing. This prefecture continued to be centered in northern Hebei through the Three Kingdoms and Western Jin Dynasty. In the Sixteen Kingdoms period, several of the kingdoms that ruled northern China used \\"You\\" to name commandery-sized prefectures in their domain. When northern China was unified under a single sovereign during the Northern Dynasties, You became a commandery-sized prefecture based in modern Beijing. During the Sui Dynasty, prefectures were not used as a level of administration, and You was renamed Zhuo Commandery (Zhuojun). You was revived during the Tang Dynasty as a smaller, commandery prefecture; its capital Youzhou was within present-day Beijing. In the Five Dynasties period, You was one of Sixteen Prefectures ceded to the Khitans of Manchuria. Thereafter, the name You Prefecture was no longer used.

History =Prehistory= The Drum Tower at Beizhen, Jinzhou, Liaoning, with the inscription \\"Stronghold of Youzhou\\". Beizhen was part of You Prefecture during the Han Dynasty, when it was the size of a province. According to several ancient texts from the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BC), You was one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. Ancient Chinese histories use the Nine Provinces to describe the geographic division of China during the two earliest Chinese dynasties, the Xia (2070‚Äì1600 BC) and the Shang (1600‚Äì1046 BC). The \\"Book of Xia\\" in the Classic of History from the earlier Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476 BC) states that Yu the Great, founder of the Xia Dynasty, divided China into Nine Provinces‚ÄîJizhou, Yanzhou, Qingzhou, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Jingzhou, Yuzhou, Liangzhou and Yongzhou‚Äîand does not mention Youzhou as one of the nine. But the Erya from about the 3rd Century BC includes Youzhou and Yingzhou instead of Qingzhou and Liangzhou; the L√º's Annals of the Spring and Autumn Annals, compiled in 239 BC, includes Youzhou instead of Liangzhou; and the Rites of Zhou from the middle of the 2nd Century BC includes Youzhou and Bingzhou in place of Xuzhou and Liangzhou. Subsequent texts describe as Youzhou as one of the Twelve Provinces of Ancient China. Sima Qian in the Records of the Grand Historian, written from 109 to 91 BC explains that Shun, sovereign who relinquished power to Yu the Great, felt the domain in north was too vast and created three new prefectures including Youzhou from Yanzhou. The Book of Han, completed in AD 111, also lists Youzhou as one of the Twelve Ancient Provinces. All of these texts described Youzhou as essentially equivalent to the State of Yan, one of the seven powers of the Warring States era.(Chinese) Map of Youzhou during the Western Han Dynasty Accessed 2012-12-19 =Han Dynasty= Youzhou was first instituted as an administrative unit in 106 BC during the Han Dynasty. In 106 BC, Emperor Wu of Han organized the Western Han Dynasty into 13 province-sized prefectures, each administered by a cishi () or inspector. You Prefecture comprised the Shanggu, Zhuo, Guangyang, Dai, Bohai, Yuyang, Right Beiping, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies.(Chinese) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂéÜÂè≤ÊîøÂå∫ Ë•øÊ±â Last accessed 2013-01-20 Altogether the eleven commanderies contained 173 counties. The prefectural seat was the City of Ji in Guangyang Commandery, which is part of modern Beijing Municipality. Youzhou was bordered by Bingzhou (present-day eastern and northern Shanxi) in the west, Jizhou (southern Hebei) and Qingzhou (northern Shandong) in the south, Korea in the east and the steppes in the north. In the Eastern Han Dynasty, You Prefecture had ten commanderies‚ÄîZhuo, Dai, Shangu, Yuyang, Right Beiping, Liaoxi, Liaoning, Xuantu, Lelang and Guangyang, as well as the Principality of Liaodong.(Chinese) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂéÜÂè≤ÊîøÂå∫ ‰∏úÊ±â Accessed 2012-12-19 Collectively, You Prefecture had 90 counties. The City of Ji in Yan Principality, continued to serve as prefectural capital.(Chinese) Map of You Prefecture during the Eastern Han Dynasty] Accessed 2012-12-19 Toward the end of the Han Dynasty, Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted in Hebei in AD 184 and briefly seized You Prefecture's administrative seat at Ji. The court relied on regional militaries to put down the rebellion and You Prefecture was controlled successively by warlords Liu Yu, Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shao, Yuan Xi and Cao Cao. In 192, Liu Yu was overthrown by his subordinate Gongsun Zan. Two years later, Gongsun Zan was driven out of Ji by Yuan Shao with the help of Wuhuan and Xianbei allies from the steppes. After Yuan Shao lost supremacy of North China to Cao Cao in the Battle of Guandu in AD 200, his son Yuan Xi held You Prefecture until 204 before fleeing to the Wuhuan. Cao Cao eventually defeated the Wuhuan in AD 207 and pacified North China. =Three Kingdoms= During the Three Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Wei founded by Cao Cao's son, controlled ten of the Han Dynasty's prefectures including You Prefecture and its capital Ji. Within the jurisdiction of You Prefecture were eleven commanderies, Fanyang, Yan Principality, Beiping, Shanggu, Dai, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Xuantu, Lelang, Changli and Daifang, which collectively ruled 60 counties. In 238, Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign against Gongsun Yuan extended the eastern reach of You to Liaodong. In 244-45, Guanqiu Jian launched the Goguryeo‚ÄìWei Wars against Goguryeo from Xuantu Commandery (modern-day Shenyang). The Wei court instituted offices in You Prefecture to manage relations with the Wuhuan and Xianbei. To help sustain the troops garrisoned in Youzhou, the governor in AD 250 built the Lilingyan, an irrigation system that greatly improved agricultural output in the plains around Ji.(Chinese) È≠èÊôãÂçÅÂÖ≠ÂõΩÊó∂ÊúüÁöÑÂπΩÂ∑ûÂüé, Âåó‰∫¨ÂüéÂ∏ÇÂéÜÂè≤Âú∞ÁêÜ 2005-12-30 =Jin Dynasty= In the Western Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì316), You Prefecture had seven commanderies and 34 counties. The capital was moved from the City of Ji to Fanyang Commandary in what is today Zhuozhou.(Chinese) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂéÜÂè≤ÊîøÂå∫ ‰∏âÂõΩ Last accessed 2013-01-20 The Western Jin expanded the number of counties from 19 in 265 to 31 in 291. Five commanderies and 26 counties in modern Liaoning that used to belong to You Prefecture were carved out to create Pingzhou. You remained an important prefecture on the northern frontier. In AD 270, the imperial court appointed Wei Guan as the governor of the prefecture. Wei Guan was succeeded by Tang Bin (appointed 282) and Zhang Hua (appointed 291). By the time of the Rebellion of the Eight Princes, You Prefecture was controlled by Wang Jun, who secured alliances with nomadic tribes north of it by arranging marriages of his daughters to tribal chieftains of the Xianbei and Wuhuan. Wang Jun's support for Emperor Sima Lun against other princes earned the enmity of Sima Ying, who in 304, arranged to appoint He Yan as the governor of You Prefecture and instructed He Yan to eliminate Wang Jun. He Yan then conspired with a Wuhuan chieftain, Shen Deng, to assassinate Wang Jun during a field trip to the Qingquan River just south of Ji. However, during their trip, the travelers encountered a rainstorm and their weapons rusted. Shen Deng believed the rain storm was divine intervention in favor of Wang Jun and disclosed the plot. Wang Jun then killed He Yan and regained control of You. He and his allies Sima Teng, Duan Wuwuchen of the Duan Xianbei clan, and the Wuhuan then attacked Sima Ying in southern Hebei. Sima Ying permitted Liu Yuan, an ethnic Xiongnu commander to leave Ye in southern Hebei and return to Shanxi to mobilize the Xiongnu folk for this war. Back in Shanxi, Liu Yuan built a multi-ethnic army and broke free from the Jin Dynasty. In 308, he declared himself emperor of the Han, a kingdom later named Zhao and known to historians as the Former Zhao. In 316, Liu Yuan's adopted son Liu Yao captured Emperor Min of Jin in Luoyang, ending the Western Jin Dynasty. Sima Rui resurrected the dynasty in Jiankang (modern-day Nanjing), known as the Eastern Jin, which continued to rule southern China. Northern China was divided into a series of kingdoms, mostly founded by ethnic minorities. Wang Jun in Youzhou remained loyal to the Eastern Jin regime in Jiankang and repelled several attacks by one of Liu Yuan's subordinates, Shi Le, an ethnic Jie. Shi Le then used wealth to buy off Wang Jun's ally, Duan Jilujuan and Duan Mopei. This angered Wang Jun, who arranged for the Tuoba Xianbei from the west to attack the Duan Xianbei, but the latter prevailed. In 314, Shi Le pretended to surrender to Wang Jun, who fell for the ruse and lowered his guard. Shi Le then captured and killed Wang Jun, but You Prefecture fell to the control of Duan Pidi, of the Xianbei Duan clan. In 319, Shi Le, founded his own kingdom, the Later Zhao, in Xiangguo (modern day Xingtai, Hebei Province), defeated Duan Pidi and captured You Prefecture. In 349, the Later Zhao regime was subverted by Ran Min, which founded the Ran Wei regime in southern Hebei. During this turmoil, the Murong clan of the Xianbei from the Liaodong region launched a southern invasion. The Murong clan had founded the Kingdom of Yan (Former Yan) in 337 but remained a vassal of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In 350, Murong Jun, the Prince of Yan, at the suggestion of his half brother Murong Chui, attacked the Later Zhao and Ran Wei in the name of restoring northern China to Jin rule. They quickly captured You. In 352, Murong Jun declared himself emperor and moved the capital from Jicheng () in modern Liaoning to Jicheng () in You Prefecture. Five years later the capital of this kingdom moved south to Ye. In 370, the Former Yan Kingdom was conquered by the Former Qin Kingdom, led by Fu JiƒÅn an ethnic Di and his general, Wang Meng. They were assisted by Murong Chui, who defected from the Former Yan due to court intrigue. In 383, after the Former Qin was defeated by the Eastern Jin in the Battle of Feishui, Murong Chui founded the Kingdom of Later Yan, which occupied much of the territories of the Former Yan, including You. To the west, the Tuoba Xianbei founded the Kingdom of Northern Wei in 386 and invaded the Northern Yan in 396, capturing Yuyang, Ji and other cities in You Prefecture. By 439, the Northern Wei extinguished the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms and unified northern China. Other Youzhous during the Sixteen Kingdoms During the Sixteen Kingdoms period (304-439), in addition to the You Prefecture in northern Hebei, which was successively controlled by the Later Zhao, Former Yan, Former Qin, Later Zhao and Northern Wei, several other kingdoms in other parts of China also named administrative divisions within their domain \\"Youzhou\\". \\"ÂçÅÂÖ≠ÂõΩÊîøÂå∫\\" Chinabaike Accessed 2011-02-08 When Liu Yuan ruled the kingdom of Former Zhao, the You Prefecture of Former Zhao was based in present-day Lishi, Shanxi.

Historically the main styles were top-fermented Bitters, Porters, Stouts and Milds, but after World War II lagers took over half the market by volume. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) was founded in 1971 and has encouraged the preservation and revival of traditional styles of ale. In particular CAMRA has promoted cask conditioned beer, which completes its maturation in casks in the cellar of the pub rather than at the brewery. the UK drank of cask ale, representing 60% of ale in pubs and restaurants and 17% of all beer in pubs. In total 42.42 million hectolitres of beer were produced in 2013 of which 48% was sold in the off-trade (retail shops). History :For more in-depth articles about beer in the United Kingdom by region, see Beer in England, Beer in Northern Ireland, Beer in Scotland and Beer in Wales. In the Middle Ages beer was brewed by abbeys and independent alehouses, but the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century meant British brewing lost its connection with religious houses earlier than in other European countries. As a result, the industry has some of the oldest names in British corporate history ‚Äì Shepherd Neame were incorporated in 1698, and the Bass Red Triangle and Diamond were the first trademarks to be registered. Family companies became national brands during the 19th century, many based in Burton-on-Trent which had particularly good water for brewing. By the 1970s brewing became concentrated in a handful of large national companies, which became building blocks of major multinationals such as AB InBev. A tax cut for small breweries in 2002 has seen an explosion of new breweries ‚Äì there were over 1472 breweries in the UK, with three new breweries starting every week. This is the most breweries per capita in the world; they produce over 8,000 regular beers and thousands more seasonal and one-off brews. The first tax on beer in the United Kingdom was the Saladin tithe, introduced in 1188 by Henry II to raise money for the crusades of hops were grown in 2014, down from a peak of in 1878. British varieties and their offspring have come to dominate world hop production, both landraces such as Fuggles or Goldings and products of the breeding programme at Wye College such as Challenger and Target. The cool maritime climate means that British-grown hops have less myrcene than the same varieties grown elsewhere, allowing more delicate, complex aromas to come through. British ales tend to reflect these characteristics and have more of a balance between bitterness and aroma compared to New World craft ales, although in the 2010s many British breweries added an American Pale Ale to their range with very citrussy, hoppy aromas. Economy Production of beer in the UK faces a challenge from the rising cost of raw materials. The regional breweries are developing contract brewing to keep up production, while the production of ale by the newer, smaller breweries grows. Despite an overall drop in beer sales, real ale has increased its market share. Brewers such as Shepherd Neame, Greene King and Marston's have invested in cheaper, faster and more efficient production facilities which increase capacity. Imported beers are increasingly popular. Brewers from Eastern Europe are introducing their brands to the UK. Polish brands Okocim, Lech, Tyskie and ≈ªywiec have also gained a foothold in some areas, especially amongst young Polish migrant workers. The growth in microbreweries in the UK led CAMRA to announce in September 2014 that 'Britain now has more breweries per person than anywhere in the World after two years of continued growth'. A year later CAMRA announced that 'Micropubs leading the way for better beer as new research shows 70% of pubs now serve real ale'. There being 53,444 pubs in the UK, of which 37,356 serve real ale. Much of the growth in microbreweries can be put down to reductions in Excise Duty, an idea which began in 2002. Currently, a single producer of less than 5,000 hectolitres per annum receives a 50% reduction in the duty payable and tapered relief for production from 5,000 to 60,000 hectolitres. In 2016 a study showed around 1,700 breweries now operate in the UK, an increase of 8% on the previous year.

History The lighthouse was constructed as an aid to shipping entering Baltimore; it was built on Bodkin Island (not to be confused with an island of the same name located south of Kent Island), and was the first lighthouse in Maryland. The station was built by Thomas Evans and William Coppeck, who completed the stone tower and attached one-story keeper's dwelling in October 1821. Thirteen lamps were purchased from Winslow Lewis, and the station was formally inaugurated in January 1822. The lighthouse was plagued by problems stemming from its poor construction during much of its brief existence, and it was replaced in 1856 by the Seven Foot Knoll Light in the Patapsco River. A fisherman is said to have lived in the dwelling for a time, but eventually the island was completely abandoned; the old tower collapsed in 1914. Today, Bodkin Island has disappeared, eaten away by erosion. What remains of the site is marked as a \\"navigational hazard\\" on sea charts.

When a post office was established in 1879, the name Rochelle was suggested by a local settler from La Rochelle, France, which was accepted by postal officials. A one-room schoolhouse was first built in 1886 when the community had a population of approximately 30. The Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway Company laid its track from Brownwood to Brady in 1903. A second line, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad completed its track from Eden to Lometa in 1912. The arrival of the railroads caused Rochelle to grow substantially. The number of inhabitants had risen to around 700 by 1914. In 1930, several smaller schools consolidated with Rochelle High School. These schools were Placid, Claxton, Corn Creek, and Round Mountain. Several more schools, including Cowboy, Fairview, East Sweden, and Mercury had transferred their students to Rochelle by the end of 1937. Rochelle's population during the 1930s was just over 500 and remained at that level until the 1950s. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway abandoned its track through the community in 1959, accelerating the rate of decline. By the early 1960s, only 100 people remained in Rochelle. That figure rose slightly to 163 in the 1960s and remained at that level through 2000.

Following an Ontario government report in 1967 which recommended the creation of a theatre company in Sudbury, local arts patrons Sonja Dunn, Carolyn Fouriezos, Bill Hart, Bob Remnant and Peg Roberts raised funds to bring the Gryphon Theatre Company of Barrie to Sudbury for a production of Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn. That production was staged at Laurentian University's Fraser Auditorium in May 1970. Following that production, the Sudbury Theatre Centre was officially incorporated on September 14, 1971. Over the next number of years, the STC staged plays and children's theatre workshops at Fraser Auditorium, Cambrian College and the Inco Club. Its success was largely due to the dedication of long-standing artistic director Tony Lloyd, who made it his mission to build a theatre for the people of Sudbury. In 1980, the city of Sudbury donated a parcel of municipal land on Shaughnessy Street near Civic Square to the STC for the construction of their own permanent 289-seat theatre. Construction began in July 1981, and the new facility was officially opened at the launch of the company's 1982 theatre season. In 2015, the theatre underwent a modernization that included renovations to the lobby and an updated and improved lounge area. At the same time, the expanded their liquor license into the auditorium and improved ticketing for expedited entry. As of 2017, STC has expanded their programming to include a performing arts series that includes music, dance, comedy, and spectacle. These offerings complement their existing main-stage theatre series.

Retrieved 4 December 2012 Macbeth was selected to screen at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006. Plot In a cemetery the Weird Sisters, three school girl witches, are destroying and defacing headstones and statues, while close by Lady Macbeth weeps beside a headstone marked \\"beloved son\\" and Macbeth stands by. The three witches plan to meet with Macbeth later, and leave the cemetery. Macbeth leads Duncan's gang to a drug deal with Macdonwald and his men. In a gunfight between the gangs, all of Macdonwald's gang are killed. While chasing two gunmen, Banquo and Macbeth are led to the Cawdor Club. They seize the club and kill the owner. Duncan hands the club over to Macbeth, and Macbeth and Banquo celebrate by drinking the club's alcohol and taking pills found on a table. During this drug trip Macbeth meets the three witches, who prophesy that he will soon be in Duncan's position with control over the gang. He tells his wife this, though she doubts he has it in him to take over Duncan's position. Later when she learns that Duncan will be dining and staying at their house, she plots with her husband to kill him. Lady Macbeth drugs Duncan's bodyguards, and while they sleep Macbeth takes their knives and kills Duncan, framing the guards. Macduff comes to Inverness and finds Duncan murdered in his bed. Before the bodyguards can profess their innocence Macbeth shoots them. Malcolm, Duncan's son, immediately suspects Macbeth as having something to do with his father's death and flees. After Macbeth is hailed as the new leader by most of Duncan's gang Macbeth sends two murderers to kill Banquo and his son, Fleance. The murderers kill Banquo, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth holds a celebratory dinner, and after learning that Banquo has been killed, sees a vision of Banquo's ghost at the dining table. Macbeth is becoming shaken by his desire for power. Lennox, Ross and others suspect Macbeth of killing Duncan and Banquo. Macbeth finds the three witches in his house that evening and, after drinking a foul potion and engaging in an orgiastic sexual encounter with them, asks the witches of his future. He is told to fear Macduff, but no man \\"of woman born shall kill you\\". Later it is revealed that Macduff is not a natural birth, but a caesarean section, which is not \\"of woman born\\". He is also shown a vision of Fleance being hailed as gang leader. These prophecies enrage Macbeth, as does the witches' quick disappearance, and he has the murderers go to Macduff's home and brutally kill Lady Macduff and her son. Lennox and Ross go to tell Macduff who has gone to his uncle Siward. Malcolm convinces him that Macbeth has gone much too far in his quest for power and must be stripped of his leader status. Lady Macbeth has become more insane, re-imagining the evening of Duncan's killing and tries to wash off his blood from her hands. A doctor sedates her, and Macbeth appears indifferent to her instability. He prepares for the impending attack from Macduff, Lennox and Ross. Lady Macbeth commits suicide in a bath tub by slashing her wrists, enraging Macbeth. The two murderers, realising the unlikeliness of surviving the attack, swiftly flee Dunsinane leaving Macbeth with only Seyton, his main bodyguard, and two others. The murderers run into Macduff and his associates at the edge of Burnham Wood and are shot. Malcolm leads his men to Dunsinane where they ambush the house and a gunfight ensues. Macbeth is chased to the cellar where he faces off with Macduff and is stabbed in the stomach. He stumbles upstairs to his bedroom, where the body of Lady Macbeth lies, and dies at her side. As Macduff leads Fleance, now the inherited gang leader, from the house Macbeth's \\"tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\\" speech is heard.

Although he was survived by several other claimants in the 1950s, such as William Lundy, John B. Salling and Walter Williams, historical research has subsequently debunked these claims. Crump officially remains the last surviving veteran of the Confederate Army. Biography Born in Crawford's Cove, St. Clair County, Alabama, Crump and a friend left home and traveled to Petersburg, Virginia, where Crump enlisted as a private in the 10th Alabama Infantry Regiment in November 1864. Assigned to Company A, Crump saw action at the Battle of Hatcher's Run, and participated in the siege of Petersburg before witnessing General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House to Union General Ulysses S. Grant. Returning home to rural Alabama, Crump soon relocated to Lincoln, in nearby Talladega County. There, at the age of 22, he married a local woman named Mary Hall. They had five children from their marriage, which lasted until she died on December 31, 1901. Crump later married Ella Wallis of Childersburg in 1905. After her death in July 1942, he lived with a grandson's family. The United Confederate Veterans awarded him the honorary title of colonel in its organization. In 1950, he met with 98-year-old \\"General\\" James Moore, who was recognized as the only other Confederate veteran remaining in Alabama.

The galaxy has a relatively bright nucleus and a bright disk that contains multiple dust lanes. The galaxy's high surface brightness makes it an object that is visible to amateur astronomers using large amateur telescopes. Distance measurements for NGC 5005 vary from 13.7 megaparsecs (45 million light-years) to 34.6 megaparsecs (113 million light- years), averaging about 20 megaparsecs (65 million light-years). Nucleus NGC 5005 contains a low ionization nuclear emission region (LINER) nucleus. LINER nuclei contain weakly ionized gas. The power source for the LINER emission has been debated extensively, with some researchers suggesting that LINERs are powered by active galactic nuclei that contain supermassive black holes and other researchers suggesting that LINERs are powered by star formation activity. =X-ray emission= X-ray observations of NGC 5005 have revealed that it contains a variable, point-like hard X-ray source in its nucleus. These results imply that NGC 5005 contains a supermassive black hole. The strong, variable X-ray emission is characteristic of the emission expected from the hot, compressed gas in the environment outside a black hole in an active galactic nucleus. Companion galaxy NGC 5005 and the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5033 comprise a physical galaxy pair. The two galaxies weakly influence each other gravitationally, but they are not yet close enough to each other to be distorted by the tidal forces of the gravitational interaction.

The five-string's styling is based on the classic look of the Silhouette guitar. Advanced active electronics combine the best of the four-string StingRay along with innovations from Music Man designers, such as an Alnico humbucking pickup and three-way pickup selector for series, single and parallel combinations. The tuners are placed in a 4+1 configuration and the six-bolt on maple neck has a rosewood or maple fingerboard with 22 high- profile wide frets. In 1991, Pole pieces changed from Alnico to Ceramic In late 1992, a hum-cancelling \\"phantom\\" coil was added for noise reduction in single coil mode of the three-way pickup selector. In 2005, the StingRay 5 was updated with two humbuckers (HH) or a bridge humbucker paired with a neck single coil pickup (HS) and a five-way pickup switching system. The single humbucker model continues to be in production as well. In 2006, Music Man released a Limited Edition StingRay 5 featuring a five-bolt neck plate, back- routed controls, string-through body, and an ebony fingerboard. The same year, MusicMan started using compensated nuts on all their bass and guitar models except the Classic series, after having used them for the Music Man Bongo since 2003. In March 2008, Ernie Ball switched back to AlNiCo pickups for their StingRay 5, after having used ceramic pickups for this model since 1991.

Kuwae Caldera cuts through the flank of the Tavani Ruru volcano on Epi and the northwestern end of Tongoa. The submarine volcano Karua, one of the most active volcanoes of Vanuatu, is near the northern rim of Kuwae Caldera.  Eruptive history  Tongoa and Epi islands once formed part of a larger island called Kuwae. Local folklore tells of a cataclysmic eruption that split this island into two smaller islands with an oval 12 x 6 km caldera in between (but the story tells of an eruption south of Tongoa). Collapse associated with caldera formation may have been as much as 1100 m. Around 32‚Äì39 km¬≥ of magma was erupted, making the Kuwae eruption one of the largest in the last 10,000 years. http wwwobs.univ-bpclermont.fr/lmv/ird/Van_Kuwae.html, In Antarctic and Greenland ice cores, a major eruption or series of eruptions is revealed as a spike in sulfate concentration, showing that the release in form of particles was higher than any other eruption since. Also, analysis of the ice cores pinpointed the event to late 1452 or early 1453. The volume of expelled matter is more than six times larger than that of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption and would have caused severe cooling of the entire planet the following three years. The link between the sulphur spike and the Kuwae caldera is questioned in a 2007 study by K√°roly N√©meth, et al. proposing the Tofua caldera as an alternative source candidate. = Recent activity = Since the eruption of c. 1452, Kuwae caldera has had several smaller eruptions with Volcanic Explosivity Indexes (VEIs) of 0 to 3. The latest confirmed eruption occurred on 4 February 1974 ¬± 4 days. It had a VEI of 0, and was a submarine eruption that formed a new island. Islands have regularly formed in Kuwae caldera. The 1897‚Äì1901 eruption built an island 1 km long and 15 m high. It disappeared within 6 months. The 1948‚Äì1949 eruption formed an island and built a cone 1.6 km in diameter and 100 m high. That island also lasted less than one year. All the islands have disappeared from wave action and caldera floor movements. In 1959, the island reappeared for a short time and again in 1971. The last structure remained an island until 1975.Vanuatu : √Æles de cendre et de corail Activity at present at Kuwae is confined to intermittent fumarole activity, which stain the water yellow. Over the top of the volcano hydrogen sulfide bubbles reach the surface.Dossier  Climatic consequences of 1452‚Äì1453 event  The Kuwae eruption has been linked with the second pulse of the Little Ice Age, which had started two centuries earlier with a series of four unidentified eruptions.Miller et al. 2012. \\"Abrupt onset of the Little Ice Age triggered by volcanism and sustained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks\\" Geophysical Research Letters 39, January 31 A study by Dr Kevin Pang of the Jet Propulsion Laboratoryrelease 1993 1543 drew on evidence found in tree rings, ice cores and in the historic records of civilizations in Europe and China. Oak panels of British portrait paintings had abnormally narrow rings in 1453‚Äì55. In Sweden, grain tithes fell to zero as the crops failed; Western US bristlecone pines show frost damage in 1453; and the growth of European and Chinese trees was stunted in 1453‚Äì57. Mexican codices describe autumn frosts in 1453 that affected agriculture throughout central Mexico. According to the history of the Ming Dynasty in China in the spring of 1453, \\"Nonstop snow damaged wheat crops\\". Later that year, as the dust obscured the sunlight, \\"Several feet of snow fell in six provinces; tens of thousands of people froze to death\\". Early in 1454, \\"it snowed for 40 days south of the Yangtze River and countless died of cold and famine\\". Lakes and rivers were frozen, and the Yellow Sea was icebound out to 20 km from shore. The eruption occurred just before the Fall of Constantinople, the last bastion of the once-mighty Byzantine Empire. The Ottoman Turks, led by Sultan Mehmed II, laid siege to the city on 5 April 1453 and conquered it on 29 May 1453. Pang found mention of the volcano's after- effects in chronicles of the city's last days. Historians noted that the city's gardens, that spring, produced very little. On the night of 22 May 1453, the moon, the symbol of Constantinople, rose in dark eclipse, fulfilling a prophecy of the city's demise. On 25 May 1453, a thunderstorm burst on the city: \\"It was impossible to stand up against the hail, and the rain came down in such torrents that whole streets were flooded\\". The next day, on 26 May 1453, the whole city was blotted out by a thick fog, a condition that is unknown in that part of the world in that month. When the fog lifted that evening, \\"flames engulfed the dome of the Hagia Sophia, and lights, too, could be seen from the walls, glimmering in the distant countryside far behind the Turkish camp (to the west)\\", historians noted. Residents of the city thought the strange light was from reflection from a fire set by the Turkish attackers. Pang said, however, that the \\"fire\\" was an optical illusion by the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere. Many such false fire alarms were reported worldwide after the 1883 Krakatoa eruption in Indonesia. Pang said, \\"I conclude that Kuwae erupted in early 1453.... The residual volcanic cloud could have made the apocalyptic June 1456 apparition of the Comet Halley look 'red' with a 'golden' tail, as reported by contemporary astronomers\\".

These small frogs are also commonly called sedge frogs. The population occurring in Indonesia may not be L. bicolor, and research on call structure or genetics is needed to confirm its taxonomic status. Description Litoria bicolor The northern dwarf tree frog is small, slender tree frog growing up to 30 mm in length. The dorsal surface is green and is bordered by a bronze stripe. Ecology and behaviour Most abundant in grassland or marshy areas, but also occurs along permanent or semi-permanent streams, billabongs and floodplains. Breeding starts with summer rains and 10-24 eggs are laid on submerged vegetation in temporary pools. Males call from around the breeding site from elevated positions. The call is a \\"wree-e-eck pippip\\" with the second part of the call starting before the first part finishes. Tadpole metamorphosis takes 70 to 80 days. Similar species The northern dwarf tree frog is a member of the Litoria fallax complex, which includes also includes the eastern dwarf tree frog (L. fallax), Cooloola tree frog (L. cooloolensis) and Olongburra frog (L. olongburensis). All these species are similar in appearance (small, <30 mm and similar body shape) and have a similar call (ratchet-like \\"wreek\\"). The northern dwarf tree frog is most similar to the eastern dwarf tree frog. They occur together along the east coast of Queensland. L. bicolor can be distinguished from L. fallax most readily by the presence of a bronze stripe that runs down the flanks and the call. The first phase of the call of L. bicolor is twice as long as that of L. fallax. References *Barker, J.; Grigg, G.C.; Tyler,M.J. (1995). A Field Guide to Australian Frogs.

Colm played a crucial part in Stradbally's Laois championship title win stopping Portlaoise going for their 10 in a row title when a Jody Dillon last minute goal beat Graham Brody who could only watch with disbelief. Recruitment Begley was scouted by the Lions football manager Graeme Allan, along with several other potential recruits during a training camp in Ireland, having previously witnessed a near best on ground performance from the young Irishman in the Under 19s International Rules series playing for Ireland against Australia. Begley was later persuaded to move to Australia as a rookie listed professional Australian rules footballer in 2005. AFL career =Brisbane Lions= Begley played his very first game of Australian rules immediately after moving from Ireland to Australia in 2006. In just his third game weeks later, he lined up in a NAB Cup quarter final. In that game he picked up a total of six possessions and one mark whilst playing on Melbourne speedster Aaron Davey. He was later elevated to the senior list during the regular season when the Lions suffered a string of injuries. In his senior debut against the West Coast Eagles he gathered seven possessions, seven marks and two hitouts, lining up on Brownlow Medallist Chris Judd. At the end of the season he was retained by the club as a rookie listed player. Following his good form through the 2007 NAB Cup, Begley was once again elevated onto the Brisbane Lions' senior playing list and was soon after named on the interchange bench in the Lions' first game for the season.

Its goal is to provide clinical surveillance in France for 10 health indicators. This network, created in November 1984 by Professor Alain-Jacques Valleron, is regulated under the auspices of the mixed research unit U1136 of Inserm and Sorbonne University. Continuous surveillance of 10 health indicators This national system of clinical surveillance collects real-time epidemiological data, originating from the participating general practitioners, to be used in analysis, forecasting and redistribution. It is also a part of the surveillance warning system directed by French national agency of public health (Sant√© publique France) (receiving the CNIL‚Äôs favorable recommendation n¬∞471 393). The 10 health indicators surveyed are 9 infectious diseases: * Influenza-like illness (ILI) since 1984, * Male urethritis since 1984 * Mumps since 1985, * Acute diarrhea (gastroenteritis) since 1990, * Varicella zoster since 1990, * Herpes zoster since 2004, * Lyme disease since 209 * Pertussis since 2017 * Acute respiratory infection since 2017 and 1 non infectious diseases: * Suicide and attempted suicide since 1997 The surveillance system detects, alerts, and predicts future regional and national epidemics specifically for influenza, gastroenteritis and Varicella zoster. The patient de-identified data is obtained via Internet by the Sentinelles doctors and directly streamed into a Geographic information system (GIS) database. A weekly report, called Sentiweb-Hebdo, is edited every Tuesday on the home webpage of the Sentinelle Network and is emailed to more than 10000 subscribers, including members of the national media. An annual report of the number of cases reported is also edited using the surveillance data. These reports are available for online viewing, and can be accessed on the Sentinelles home webpage in the section titled \\"documentation/bilans annuels\\" (or ‚Äúannual reports and totals‚Äù). Scientific research The data provided by the Sentinelles Network had provided research in the following domains: * Models of detection and alert systems (Serfling regression methods, Costagliola D. and coll ., Am. J. Public Health, on 1991) * Prediction models of epidemics involving different geographical levels (‚ÄúMethod of analogues‚Äù, Viboud C. and coll ., Am J Epidemiol, on 2003). Field epidemiology Epidemiological inquiries are regularly performed among the Sentinelles doctors. Their purpose is to maintain the ethical conduct of epidemiological research developed by the ‚ÄúAssociation des √©pid√©miogistes de langue fran√ßaise‚Äù, or the Association of Epidemiologists of the French Language. The order of each inquiry is prespecified in a written protocol. The inquiries are then summarized in a final report and submitted per protocol to the internal auditors to assure their quality.

The battle began on March 9 and lasted until March 10 with the fall of the U.S. Army's Special Forces camp of the same name. The battle was a strategic victory for the PAVN in that they were able to take control of the A Shau Valley and use it as a base area for the rest of the war. Background The A Shau Special Forces Camp was located in the A S·∫ßu Valley, about 30 miles (50 km) southwest of Hu·∫ø and 2km east of the Laos border in Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province. The valley was strategically important for the PAVN as a major infiltration route because it served as a bridge from the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos into populated coastal areas of Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province. The camp had been established in 1963. Defending the camp were 10 Green Berets from the 5th Special Forces Group and 210 South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Group, supported by Air Commando units equipped with vintage A-1 Skyraiders and AC-47 Spooky gunships. Two South Vietnamese camps at A L∆∞·ªõi and Ta Bat in the A Shau valley had been abandoned on 8 December 1965. The special forces camp was routinely harassed by small Vietcong formations leading up to the battle. Throughout February and March, 1966, platoon-sized troops from the camp were sent out to conduct reconnaissance patrols in the surrounding area. On March 5, two PAVN defectors turned up at the camp. Under interrogation, they indicated that four battalions of the PAVN 325th Division were planning to attack the camp. Based on that information, night patrols were dispatched to confirm the enemy positions but no sightings were made. However, Air Commandos conducting reconnaissance flights observed large build-ups of PAVN troops along with anti-aircraft emplacements. As a result, airstrikes were ordered against enemy positions. On March 7, the A Shau camp was reinforced with seven U.S. Special Forces personnel, nine interpreters, and a MIKE Force Company in anticipation of the North Vietnamese attack. Battle On March 8, the camp was placed on general alert and the camp's defenders had taken up their positions. A PAVN assault was launched during the night, but it was beaten back. Because of poor weather conditions that would hinder tactical air and resupply efforts, the PAVN decided to continue despite their heavy casualties. The second attack began during the early morning hours of March 9 with mortar bombardment, damaging communications and reducing many defensive positions to rubble. At 1300 hours an AC-47D \\"Spooky 70\\" from the 4th Air Commando Squadron, circling the camp, fired on the attacking PAVN formations. However, the slow moving aircraft was shot down and crashed about five kilometers north of the camp. All six crewmen survived, but they were promptly attacked by the PAVN. Three crewmen were killed, though the others were eventually rescued by a USAF HH-43. Between 1630 and 1700 hours, supplies of ammunition were flown in by C-123 and CV-2 aircraft, but the resupply drops often landed outside of the camp perimeter and could not be retrieved. At the same time, helicopters were called to evacuate the wounded. However, reinforcements from Hu·∫ø and Phu Bai could not be deployed because of the bad weather, leaving the camp's defenders to repair their defensive wall and dig in for the night. On the morning of March 10, the PAVN launched another attack with mortar and recoilless rifle fire. At 0500 hours a PAVN assault team penetrated the eastern perimeter, where hand-to-hand combat took place for three hours. By 08:00 the greatly outnumbered defenders had withdrawn to the camp's north wall. Throughout the day USMC and Republic of Vietnam Air Force bombers hit PAVN positions around the camp. During the day an A-1 piloted by Major D.W. Myers was hit and forced to crash-land on the A Shau airstrip 200m from PAVN positions, Major Bernard F. Fisher landed his A-1 on the airstrip rescuing Myers, for this action Fisher was later awarded the Medal of Honor. As fighting continued the situation deteriorated as ammunition began running short and the decision was made to evacuate all personnel. At 1700 hours all communication equipment was destroyed. The survivors carried out their evacuation orders and destroyed all abandoned weapons and withdrew further to the north wall. Leading the evacuation effort were fifteen H-34 helicopters from HMM-163 supported by four UH-1B gunships of VMO-2. Panic-stricken South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians mobbed the evacuation helicopters and overwhelmed U.S. Special Forces troops as they abandoned the camp. This reached a point where the helicopters were so overloaded some Special Forces soldiers were forced to fire upon their allies to allow the helicopters to take off. Only 172 of 368 Nung and Vietnamese irregulars were flown out. The others were listed as MIA, although many would turn up later, having escaped on their own.THE FALL OF A SHAU The evacuation was further complicated by heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire, and two H-34s were lost. Aftermath American control ceased at the camp at 17:45 hours when overrun by PAVN troops. During the battle the U.S. special forces team suffered five killed and twelve wounded (100% casualties). The numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers present at the camp or how many casualties they suffered varies. Only 186 of the garrison of 434 were evacuated, with the others listed as missing, although some of them surfaced later. Another report stated 231 out of 417 irregulars were lost. According to Sgt. Major Bennie G. Adkins only 122 out of about 410 irregulars survived, with many of them wounded. Adkins was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in defense of the camp by President Barack Obama in September 2014. In May a Special Forces team entered the abandoned camp to recover the bodies of those killed in the battle, finding the bodies undisturbed and large quantities of ammunition remaining in the camp. The Special Forces team retrieved the bodies and reported back on the camp's status. On 1 June III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) commander LG Lew Walt ordered the 3rd Marine Division commander MG Wood B. Kyle to develop a plan to return to the camp and destroy the ammunition. On the morning of 23 June the Marines launched Operation Turner with Company I, 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines being landed at the camp by CH-46s of HMM-164 with air support by VMO-2 UH-1E gunships. The Marines completed the destruction of the ammunition and were airborne again after 2 hours on the ground. The PAVN transformed the A Shau Valley into a heavily fortified base area with bunkers, antiaircraft guns, and artillery. US and South Vietnamese forces were never able to re-establish a permanent presence in the valley for the remainder of the war. During the Tet Offensive the A Shau Valley provided Communist troops an important sanctuary from which to launch attacks at South Vietnamese cities and military bases, especially Hu·∫ø and Phu Bai. Raids were launched into the valley in April 1968 (Operation Delaware), August 1968 (Operation Somerset Plain), March 1969 (Operation Dewey Canyon) and May 1969 (Operation Apache Snow).

Like most traffic management systems, STREAMS is an array of institutional, human, hardware, and software components designed to monitor, control, and manage traffic on streets and highways. Advanced traffic management systems come under the banner of ITS (intelligent transport systems). ITS is the application of information and communications technology to transport operations in order to reduce operating costs,http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/publications/20140611-ICT-Improve- Traffic/20140611-ICT-Improve-Traffic.html improve safety and maximise the capacity of existing infrastructure. STREAMS provides traffic signal management, incident management, motorway management, vehicle priority, traveller information, flood monitoring https://s.campbellsci.com/documents/au/technical- papers/road_flood_monitoring_systems.pdf/ and parking guidance within a single integrated system. STREAMS is developed by Transmax.  History  In 1969, the Department of Main Roads (Queensland) installed the first Intelligent Transport System in Australia (located at Surfers Paradise). This included 30 signalised intersections featuring centralised control and traffic responsive capabilities. In 1985, a second generation traffic management system was installed in Cairns, Australia. This was known as the TRAC System, or Traffic Responsive Adaptive Control System. Progressive installation of the TRAC system followed at several more sites around Queensland including the capital city, Brisbane. In 1988, a traffic management system was installed for the South East Freeway in Brisbane, Australia. The features included were ramp metering and graphical displays of traffic conditions. It also provided automatic incident detection. In 1992, a new integrated intelligent transport system development was commenced. The objectives were to lower ongoing costs while providing increased performance and opportunity for future ITS applications. The resulting system was STREAMS. In 2002, the division of Department of Main Roads (Queensland) responsible for continuing development of STREAMS was privatised to form Transmax. The company remains 100% owned by the Queensland Government Department of Transport and Main Roads. In April 2007, Transmax in partnership with VicRoads implemented a coordinated ramp metering trial in Melbourne, Victoria on a 15 km section of the Monash Freeway. Later that year, in December, VicRoads installed STREAMS to manage another six ramps. These developments were part of a much larger M1 Upgrade Project that continued over the next three years, eventually winning the 2010 National ITS Australia Award. The project to upgrade the 75-kilometre M1 Freeway, increased the capacity and safety of the Monash Freeway, the CityLink Tollway (Southern Link) and the West Gate Freeway utilising STREAMS as the Integrated Control System. In 2016, Transmax partnered with Parsons Brinckerhoff to trial STREAMS motorway management functionality for the Utah Department of Transportation in the United States.  Software Architecture  STREAMS employs a distributed computing software architecture.http://www.transportationgroup.nz/papers/2007/A4a_Verma.pdf Field hardware such as intersection controllers, video cameras and speed detectors are connected via field processors back to a central application server. Users connect to the application server via the workstation software. Field communications are via Optical Fibre, DSL, or Wireless connections. The software is built in distinct modules for each distinct area of traffic / transport control and monitoring. The workstation software communicates to the application server software via a publisher / subscriber model (i.e. workstations subscribe to specifically requested streams of data which are published by the application server). The software architecture model is designed to support the software's claim of being an \\"integrated\\" Advanced Traffic Management System.http://www.hothousedesign.com.au/blog- layout/schematics-in-the-media#.WMheaWf-sY0 This breaks away from the inter- operability model, which is multiple ITS systems working in parallel, each performing a discrete function. The workstation software is built around a central user interface called \\"STREAMS Explorer\\". Other specification / reporting applications can all be launched from STREAMS Explorer. The transport network data is set up via a GIS (Geographic Information System). The GIS allows for a graphical user interface displaying transport network data overlaid on street maps and updating in real-time.  Adaptive Traffic Management  STREAMS implements adaptive traffic management through a feature called \\"Dynamic Plan Selection\\". Depending on the density of traffic (occupancy) and the dominant direction of traffic (for example, inbound, outbound, or bidirectional) on a road, nearby signalised intersections are operated using several predefined traffic plans. A user sets up the signal timing, and picks the traffic density levels and direction that they apply to. Selecting the appropriate signal timing is then automatic. When a time based traffic plan schedule would be inappropriate because of varying traffic levels, STREAMS Dynamic Plan Selection can adapt to unexpected traffic levels as they arise. With help from the academic community, STREAMS Smart Motorways offers the coordinated ramp-metering algorithm suite ALINEA/HERO.http://docs.trb.org/prp/14-0992.pdf The modular architecture of STREAMS allows Transmax to integrate new algorithms as they become available. STREAMS applies the computed metering rates using ramp signal controllers deployed at the roadside. Controlling multiple consecutive ramps, ideally the whole motorway, makes it possible to maintain a more consistent motorway flow and prevent flow breakdown. Using HERO, STREAMS is able to balance queues across multiple ramps and maximise motorway performance.

The Marathas defeated the small Mughal force, and engaged in sacking Surat. According to James Grant Duff, a captain in the British India Regiment, Surat was attacked by Shivaji on 5 January 1664. Surat was a wealthy port city in Mughal empire for the sea trade of the era. The city was well populated mostly by Hindus and a few Muslims, specially the officials in the Mughal administration of the city. The attack was so sudden that the population had no chance to flee. The plunder was continued for six days and two-thirds of the city was burned down. The loot was then transferred to Raigad fort. Background As Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor, was in Deccan for more than three years fighting the Marathas, the financial condition of the Maratha state was dire. So to improve his finances, Shivaji planned to attack Surat, a key Mughal power centre, and a wealthy port town which generated a million rupees in taxes. Battle =Composition of Forces= Local Subedar, Inayat Khan who was appointed by Aurangzeb, had only 1000 men at his command. After sacking the Mughal garrison Shivaji attacked the Port of Surat and set the local shipping industry ablaze. Shivaji was assisted by notable commanders along with cavalry of 4000. =Movement and clash of forces= Shivaji attacked Surat after a demand for tribute was rejected. The Mughal Sardar, was very surprised by the suddenness of the attack, unwilling to face the Maratha forces, he hid himself in the fort of Surat. However, there was an attempt of life on Shivaji by the emissary sent by the Mughal sardar. Surat was under attack for nearly three days, in which the Maratha army looted all possible wealth from Mughal and Portuguese trading centers. The Maratha soldiers took away cash, gold, silver, pearls, rubies, diamonds and emeralds from the houses of rich merchants such as Virji Vora, Haji Zahid Beg, Haji Kasim and others. The business of Mohandas Parekh, the deceased broker of the Dutch East India Company, was spared as he was reputed as a charitable man. Similarly, Shivaji did not plunder the houses of the foreign missionaries. The French traveller Francois Bernier wrote in his Travels in Mughal India:The great Maratha, Volume 2, H. S. Sardesai, Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd, 2002, , Shivaji had to complete the sacking of Surat before the Mughal Empire at Delhi was alerted and could not afford to spend much time attacking the British. Thus, Sir George Oxenden was able to successfully defend the British factory, a fortified warehouse-counting house-hostel. Casualties One Englishman named Anthony Smith, was captured by the Marathas, and funds were demanded from him. Smith wrote an account of him witnessing Shivaji ordering the cutting off of the heads and hands of those who concealed their wealth.Vincent Arthur Smith (1919), The Oxford History of India, Oxford University Press, page 435 However, when king Shivaji understood that Smith was poor he was freed. When the Mughal Army finally approached on the fourth fateful day, Shivaji and his followers galloped southwards into the Deccan.  Aftermath  All this loot was successfully transported to the Deccan before the Mughal Empire at Delhi could get the news of the sacking of Surat. This wealth later was used for developing & strengthening the Maratha State.News in London Gazzet http://www.indianexpress.com/news/researcher-finds-reference-to-shivaji- maharaj-in-foreign-newspaper/362848 This event enraged the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. Mughal Empire revenue was reduced as trade did not flourish as much after Shivaji's raid on the Port of Surat. To take his revenge the Mughal Emperor sent a veteran Rajput General Jaisingh to curb Shivaji's activities.

This dependency caused scholars to think that Prosper had been working on his own Easter Annals for quite some time. In fact, Victorius published his work only two years after the final publication of Prosper's Chronicle. Victorius finished his Cursus Paschalis in 457. From that date onward he left blank the column giving the names of the consuls, but his table continued until the year AD 559 or Anno Passionis 532 (in the year of the Passion [of Jesus] 532 ‚Äî Victorius placed the Passion in AD 28), hence the name Cursus Paschalis annorum DXXXII (Easter Table up to the year 532). This first version was later continued by other authors, who filled in the names of the consuls as the years passed. The Victorian system of the Cursus Paschalis was made official by a synod in Gaul in 541 and was still in use for historical work in England by 743, when an East Anglian king-list was created, which was double-dated with Victorian and Dionysian (A.D.) eras. Also, it was used for a letter to Charlemagne in 773, and probably, in its continued form, a source for both Bede (who found here that Aetius was consul for the third time in 446) and the Historia Brittonum. Victorius also wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were \\"a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144\\".Maher & Makowski 2001, p.383 See also * Egyptian calendar * Augustalis, whose 84-year cycle Victorius replaced * Dionysius Exiguus, whose cycle replaced Victorius's * Easter controversy & computus Notes References * Victorii Aquitani Cursus Paschalis annorum DXXXII, ed.

He was best known for serving as defense co-counsel for the Green River Killer, serial killer Gary Ridgway from 2001 to 2003. Early life and education Mark Wayne Prothero was born in Seattle, Washington. He grew up in Renton, where his family operated a boat-building business. He graduated from Renton High School in 1974.http://renton.patch.com/groups/schools/p/renton- high-school-centennial-mark-prothero-class-of-74 He attended the University of Washington on an athletic scholarship, and earned a bachelor's degree in American History in 1978. Prothero attended University of San Diego School of Law in California. Career Upon completion of his Juris Doctor in 1981, Prothero returned to Washington State to work in private practice. In 1983, he joined the Associated Counsel for the Accused (ACA), which provides legal representation for indigent defendants in King County, Washington. Prothero moved into the felony unit of ACA in 1987, and ultimately became an expert in the areas of forensic DNA evidence, offender sentencing, and the death penalty. Prothero was co-lead counsel in State v. Ridgway, the Green River Killer, the largest serial murder case in United States history. Prothero was co-lead counsel in State v. Proctor, the falsely accused Seattle youth. After the Green River case, Prothero joined the Kent, Washington law firm of Hanis, Greaney PLLC (now Hanis Irvine Prothero, PLLC). At Hanis Irvine Prothero, PLLC, Prothero headed the Criminal Defense Department. He wrote legal opinions, free legal advising, and was actively involved in local politics. He testified, presented on, and wrote about his support of Washington State Senate Bill 6340 and Senate Bill 5476 efforts to enhance state crime lab oversight and end the death penalty, respectively. He is published in such works as Washington Criminal Defense Magazine. Prothero practiced criminal defense his entire career, representing people accused of all types of crimes, from driving without a license to aggravated murder. He was on the Washington Supreme Court's Panel for Death-Penalty qualified trial attorneys since the panels inception in 1998. He was on the Board of Governors, Washington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He lectured at law schools and continuing legal education programs. In 2006, Prothero and Carlton Smith published a book entitled Defending Gary, which details Prothero's experience serving as Ridgway's lawyer. The Green River Case From 1982 through 1985, dozens of young women, most of whom were known prostitutes, turned up dead or missing in King County, Washington. These deaths and disappearances were attributed to the so-called \\"Green River Killer,\\" because the first five victims were found in or around the Green River. For almost twenty years, law enforcement officials were unable to identify the person who was responsible for the Green River murders. In the fall of 2001, however, science was able to do the job that law enforcement never could. DNA evidence which was found in or on four of the Green River victims was matched to a long-standing suspect in the case, Gary Leon Ridgway. Ridgway, a truck painter from Auburn, Washington with a measured I.Q. of 85, was charged with multiple counts of murder. Prothero first met Ridgway at the Regional Justice Center in Kent, Washington on November 30, 2001. At first, Prothero was incredulous that the mild-mannered, self-effacing Ridgway could be the elusive Green River Killer. Nevertheless, Prothero was appointed to serve as Ridgway's lead defense attorney. Prothero and his colleagues ended up negotiating a plea bargain, whereby Ridgway would give authorities information about his crimes and lead them to the bodies of his victims which had never been found. In exchange, Ridgway would be spared the death penalty. On November 5, 2003, Prothero stood at Ridgway's side as the former truck painter pleaded guilty to forty-eight counts of aggravated murder. A month later, King County Superior Court Judge Richard A. Jones sentenced Ridgway to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Legal experts agree that without the plea bargain Prothero and his colleagues brokered, Ridgway may have been sentenced to die. Personal life He lived in King County, Washington with his wife Kelly. They have two children, Sean and Marley. Prothero was a swimming coach for Kentwood High School in Covington, Washington from 1997 through 2007. Prothero spoke at academic, legal, and community functions on topics from the judicial system, constitutional rights, academia, and swimming. Prothero served as judge Pro tempore until his death from lung cancer at his home near Kent, Washington on April 19, 2014.

Droog has worked with amongst others Marcel Wanders, Hella Jongerius, Tejo Remy, Richard Hutten, Ed Annink, Jurgen Bey and Joris Laarman.  History  Droog was founded in 1993 by product designer Gijs Bakker and design historian Renny Ramakers. During the Milan Furniture Fair in 1993, the duo presented a selection of sober designs made of industrial materials and found objects. The presentation was titled 'Droog Design', because of the simplicity and dry humor of the objects. They continued by putting together design presentations reflecting a clear spirit of the times. In 1996, they extended their sphere of activities by initiating experimental projects. In the following year, Droog received its first commission from a company. In 2003 Droog B.V. was set up alongside the Droog Foundation, for the production and distribution of the Droog product collection. Since the end of 2004, the Droog headquarters has been situated in Amsterdam, combining a store, an exhibition room, a library and a kitchen. In 1999 an exhibition on Droog was held at Fundaci√≥n Joan Mir√≥ in Barcelona, followed by a retrospective exhibition in 2006/2007 at the Museum of Arts & Design in New York City entitled Simply Droog: 10 + 3 years of creating innovation and discussion. In 2004 a book was published on Droog, entitled Simply Droog: 10 + 1 years of creating innovation and discussion. In 2009, Droog opened a store in New York City's SoHo District. Activities *Projects & product development **Droog initiates projects and is also commissioned by international firms and institutions such as Mandarina Duck, Bang & Olufsen, Levi Strauss and British Airways. Droog projects can result in a single product, developed by an individual designer, or in group shows presenting a coherent series of variations on a theme. *Exhibitions **Droog organises travelling exhibitions showing Droog collection products. Droog presents designs from young (inter)national designers in their stores in Amsterdam and New York. *Education **Droog lectures worldwide at congresses and seminars. Since 2001 Droog is head of the Masters Design course IM: Identity, Industrial and Interior Masters Industrial Design studio at the Design Academy Eindhoven. *Publications **Droog takes position with provocative publications, both in terms of content and form. Droog collection The Droog collection, curated by Renny Ramakers, consists of around 200 products by more than a hundred designers. New designs are often developed and presented in relation with exhibitions (such as the knotted chair of Marcel Wanders during Dry Tech I on the Milan Furniture Fair 1996). \\"Saved by Droog\\" is an element of Droog design that buys up stock and transforms it into something completely new with a distinct voice and purpose.

He previously played for a string of British and Continental clubs. He is the brother of Samuel. Even though Samuel had most caps for their country, Guy was considered the greater talent, for instance by the journalist Kim Andr√© Ruud (Kiwi Football Monthly) Samuel, represented Cameroon at the 1998 World Cup. Career Born in Douala, Cameroon, Ipoua moved to Strasbourg, France, at the age of four. His early football career is unclear but he joined AS Nancy in 1992, and had a spell at Torino where his brother was also on loan from Inter Milan, for six months. He was also on the books of Atl√©tico Madrid, at the time the reigning La Liga champions and cup holders. He has also played for Sevilla, Alicante, √âcija Balompi√© and Novelda. Due to his prolific goalscoring form for Atletico previously, rivals Real Madrid did show interest in signing the striker - tabling an initial bid of ¬£32 million bid - subsequently rejected by Novelda CF. Real instead opted to keep faith in Spanish forward, Fernando Morientes, who had recently been signed from Real Zaragoza for ¬£6 million. In the summer of 1998, he spent three weeks on trial at Crystal Palace, but failed to secure a contract. He spent a season at Bristol Rovers where he scored 3 goals in 24 league games, before being released the following summer. A trial at Torquay United followed trial in July 1999, but he again failed to secure a contract. He subsequently went for trials at a number of clubs in England and Scotland, including Wycombe Wanderers and St Johnstone. He eventually signed for Scunthorpe United in August 1999, scoring on his debut against Bournemouth, and again against Cardiff City two days later. This earned him a contract with the club, and he enjoyed almost two successful seasons with Scunthorpe, notably scoring seven times in the space of a week. He was sold to Gillingham for just ¬£25,000, a low fee because he could have left for free a couple months later under the Bosman ruling. He was mainly used as a substitute for Gillingham up to the end of the season. After rejecting a possible move to the United States with FC Dallas, he joined Scottish side Livingston in July 2003, having missed a substantial amount of pre-season training. However, he was to make just two appearances for the club, both as a substitute. In July 2004, Ipoua signed for Doncaster Rovers, but again failed to establish himself in the first team. He joined Mansfield Town on loan in October 2004 and Lincoln City on loan in February 2005 before being released at the end of the season. In August 2005, he joined Hereford United and scored a goal in each of his first three league games. His season was disrupted by injury and in the latter stages he was used as only as a substitute. However, he shone in Hereford's successful play-off campaign, scoring an extra-time winner in the semi-final against Morecambe. In the final itself he was brought on in the second half with Hereford 2‚Äì1 down, and soon made an impact. He skillfully controlled a flick on by Andy Ferrell, played the ball out to Simon Travis and then powerfully headed the return cross into the net to equalise. In the dying minutes of extra time he also did well to run the clock down by keeping the ball in the corner while fending off the attentions of several opposing players and earning Hereford 3 consecutive corners. Unfortunately, Guy was one of several Hereford players released shortly after the final. In August 2006, he signed for Forest Green Rovers after impressing on trial in pre season for the Gloucestershire club. Ipoua made his Forest Green debut on 26 August 2006 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Gravesend & Northfleet. After making just seven appearances, five of these from the bench, Ipoua was released in September 2006 and signed for Oryx Douala in his native Cameroon.http://doncasterrovers.in- doncaster.com/2008/08/old-rovers-players-what-there-doing-now/ References Category:1976 births Category:AS Nancy players Category:Atl√©tico Madrid footballers Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Forest Green Rovers F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:La Liga players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Living people Category:Livingston F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Sevilla FC players Category:Torino F.C. players Category:Alicante CF footballers Category:Cameroonian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Guy Ipoua"},{"id":"6653275","text":"The Dorn method is a form of manual, holistic alternative therapy used to correct misalignments in the spinal column and other joints.

Since 2012 LSJS also offers rabbinical training, returning to its roots. Many leading figures in British Jewry have been associated with the School, including Michael Friedl√§nder, Principal from 1865 to 1907; Isidore Epstein, Principal 1948‚Äì1961; Louis Jacobs, Moral Tutor 1959‚Äì1961; and in recent years Jonathan Sacks (later Lord Sacks), Principal 1984‚Äì1990. History The London School of Jewish Studies was founded as Jews' College in 1855, a rabbinical seminary in London. The organisation was re-focussed and given its present name in 1999, with an emphasis on providing a broader range of adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community. The rabbinical training programme was suspended, and much of the historical holdings of the library were sold off.Hebraica Libraries Group Report: London School of Jewish Studies, via Cambridge University Library, accessed 11 October 2013 LSJS has had growing success in its new role, and since 2012 once again offers rabbinical training, in partnership with the programme set up by the London Sephardi community. =Jews' College= Jews' College was opened in Finsbury Square, London as a rabbinical seminary in 1855 with the support of Chief Rabbi Nathan Adler and of Sir Moses Montefiore, who had conceived the idea for such a venture as early as 1841. The college quickly established itself as a place where high quality rabbinical training was available and its alumni and staff often became prominent in Anglo-Jewry. In 1881, the College moved to larger premises in Tavistock Square, close to University College, where it was envisaged that Jews‚Äô College students would be able to combine their religious studies and university studies to degree level. As early as 1904, the University of London granted an Honours degree in Hebrew and Aramaic, all of the candidates being from Jews‚Äô College. In 1932, with the building of Woburn House, a centre for Anglo-Jewry, still in Tavistock Square, Jews' College moved again. During the Second World War, despite the bombing of London, the College kept its doors open. Apart from the rabbinical studies and degree course, Chazzanut courses and teacher training programmes were now offered. In 1954, the College moved, yet again, to larger premises in Montagu Place. That building in central London was sold in the early 1980s and now houses the Embassy of Sweden. The College operated from temporary premises at Finchley Synagogue for a number of years, under the leadership of Rabbi Dr Nahum Rabinovitch. Under the auspices of Rabbi Dr Jonathan Sacks and with the financial backing of Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the College relocated in 1984 to its current building, now known as Schaller House, in Hendon, North-West London, close to the hub of London's Jewish community. =London School of Jewish Studies= In 1998, the University of London announced that it would be terminating the \\"Associated Institute\\" status that the College and three other small institutions enjoyed. Jews' College was forced to seek an academic partner within the University in order to be able to continue its degree programmes. Without the freedom to determine its own curriculum and the financial security that came from student fee income, it became increasingly difficult for the College to survive in its previous form. Rabbinic training was also uneconomic as many students looked to the Torah centres of Israel and America for their education and the number of available rabbinic posts in the UK decreased. In 2002, the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) decided to terminate its relationship with LSJS, which threatened the organisation's status. A small team of young community leaders and educators, led by the late Marc Weinberg, presented the then Chair of Council, Howard Stanton, with a proposal to use the human and financial resources available to refocus the School's activities and to secure its future as a hub of academic study and lifelong learning, catering to a wide spectrum of the community. Since then, under the leadership of Dr. Raphael Zarum and Dr. Tamra Wright, LSJS has welcomed hundreds of students to a range of academic courses and events. In addition to numerous community-focused offerings, more formal programs include: *The LSJS, as of 2012, offers a Semicha programme, in conjunction with the Judith Lady Montefiore College. The part-time programme is of four years' duration (38 study weeks per year; 16 lecture hours per week). The curriculum focuses on Halacha as standard; but the course also includes Tanakh, history and ethics, as well as practical community-directed subjects such as counselling, public speaking, life events, hazanut and teaching skills. *LSJS also hosts The Montefiore Kollel, comprising an \\"intensive\\" one-year programme focused on in-depth Gemara study with emphasis on halachic applications. Applicants to the Semicha programme may be required to first spend one year in the Kollel. *The LSJS offers the following degree programs:\\"Degrees\\", lsjs.ac.uk the M.A. degree in Jewish Studies with King's College, London; and the BA (Hons) and MA in Jewish education with Middlesex University. Alei Tzion The London School of Jewish Studies also houses the synagogue Alei Tzion. The synagogue refers to itself as a \\"young and vibrant congregation \\". Services take place regularly. These include; Shacharit, Mincha and Maariv prayer. The highlight of the week are the complete Shabbat services which include 2 children's services.

It was founded at a congress in 1945 by a merger of the local branches of the Italian Communist Party and the Communist Party of Slovenia as the Communist Party of the Julian Region (Partito Comunista della Regione Giuliana, PCRG, Komunistiƒçna partija Julijske krajine, KPJK). The party published a daily newspaper, Il Lavoratore.  History  =Initial period= At the time of its foundation, the party favoured integration of the area with Yugoslavia. This stood in contrast with the line of the Italian Communist Party and its leader Palmiro Togliatti, which opposed Yugoslav claims to the region. The main leaders of the party were Rudi Ur≈°iƒç and the Yugoslav partisan leader Branko Babiƒç. In 1947, when the Free Territory was formally constituted, the party adopted the name PCTLT/KPSTO. =Tito-Cominform split= The party suffered a split following the 28 June 1948 resolution of Cominform, resulting in the expulsion of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The pro-Yugoslavia wing was led by Branko Babiƒç, and the pro-Cominform wing was led by former Comintern agent Vittorio Vidali. The pro-Cominform wing was able to retain a majority in the Central Committee (6 against 4), and Vidali became the leader of the party. Under Vidali's leadership the party began opposing the annexation of the Free Territory by Yugoslavia. The pro-Yugoslav minority was largely composed of Slovenian cadres. They formed a separate PCTLT under the leadership of Babiƒç. The pro-Yugoslav minority then regrouped as the Italian-Slovenian Popular Front (FPIS). Although initially present in both the British-U.S.-controlled Zone A and the Yugoslavian-controlled Zone B, the PCTLT led by Vidali was suppressed in Zone B after the split. The FPIS took part in FTT elections in Zone A and continued to function after the integration of Zone A into Italy. =1949 election= Communist Party F.T.T entrance, Santa Croce's branch. The PCTLT took part in the June 12, 1949 elections in the Free Territory. It obtained 35,568 votes (approximately 20% of the total vote), and 13 seats. In the same election, the pro-Yugoslav communists obtained one seat. In the rigged so-called \\"popular\\" election of the Zone B in 1950, the FPIS was largely majoritarian instead. =Ethnic composition= PCTLT was the sole pluriethnical political force in the Free Territory at the time, with a large following amongst both Italian and Slovenian workers. It ran a separate Slovenian-language organ, Delo.Egon Pelikan =Youth wing= The youth wing of the party was known as the Communist Youth Federation of the Free State of Trieste (Federazione Giovanile Comunista del Territorio Libero di Trieste). FGCTLT published Giovent√π.Fondo WEISS - DOCUMENTO There was also an Anti- Fascist Youth Union of the Free Territory of Trieste, closely linked to the FGCTLT.Archives of the Republic of Slovenia.

Beside its own city administration, Bandung also serves as the capital of the West Java province and the seat of the chief (bupati) of Bandung regency. Early settlement candi Bojongmenje ruins in Rancaekek, Bandung Regency. Although the oldest written historical reference to the Priangan region dates back to circa 14th century was found in Cikapundung inscription, where the region was one of the settlement within the Kingdom of Pajajaran, the Priangan region has been home for early human since prehistoric era, at least since 9,500 years before present. There have been some earlier prehistoric archaeological findings of early human settlements, in Pawon cave in Padalarang karst area, West of Bandung, and around the old lake of Bandung. The ruin of Bojongmenje temple was discovered in Rancaekek area, Bandung Regency, east of Bandung city. The temple is estimated to be dated from early 7th century CE, around the same period ‚Äî or even earlier, than Dieng temples of Central Java. Dutch East Indies Company Braga Street in the mid-1930s. The Dutch-built Gedung Sate During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East Indies company (VOC) established a small plantation area in the fertile and prosperous Bandung area. A supply road connecting Batavia (now Jakarta), Bogor, Cianjur, Bandung, Sumedang and Cirebon was built in 1786. In 1809, Louis Napoleon, then ruler of the Netherlands and its colonies due to Napoleon Bonaparte's establishment of this puppet state, ordered the Dutch Indies Governor H.W. Daendels to improve the defense system of Java island against the threat of the British. Daendels built a 1000 km road joining the west and east coasts of Java. Since the northern part of West Java at that time was mostly swamp and marsh, the road was diverted through Bandung. The Great Postweg (now Jalan Asia-Afrika) was laid down in 1810. Local folklore has it that when Daendels was walking along the edge of Cikapundung river, he was amazed by a site he found. He then put a stick at the edge of the Cikapundung and said: \\"Zorg, dat als ik terug kom hier een stad is gebouwd!\\" ('Make sure that when I return, a city has been built here!'). Today, this site is the geographical center of Bandung. R.A. Wiranatakusumah II, the regent of Bandung regency at that time, moved its office from Krapyak, in the south, to a place near a pair of holy city wells (sumur Bandung), which is today the 'alun-alun (city square). He built his istana (palace), masjid agung (the grand mosque) and pendopo (\\"pavilion\\") in the classical orientation. The pendopo faces Tangkuban Perahu mountain, believed to have a mystical ambiance. The fast growth of Bandung started from the area around the Jalan Asia-Afrika, the original central business district. Also concentrated in the area is the Javanese alun-alun (public square) just to the south of the road, the former residence of the Bupati, and the great mosque. In 1850, Bandung was appointed as the Residence for the part of West Java named Pariangan, which until then settled in Cianjur. There were 12,000 inhabitants around 1850. A great factor of the growth of Bandung was because of the relocation of some Departments from Batavia to Bandung. In 1880, the first major railroad in Indonesia, linking Batavia and Bandung, was laid down. It boosted light industry in Bandung. Chinese migrants flocked in to help run the facilities, services and vendor machines. A small Chinatown district can still be recognised in the vicinity of the railroad station. It started in 1914 with the Department of War, followed in 1921 by the Department of Roads and Transportation. In 1906, Bandung was given the status of gemeente (municipality) and then later as stadsgemeente (city municipality) in 1926. From 1906 to 1949, Bandung grew from a medium sized town with 38.000 inhabitants to the third City in Nederlands-Indi√´ with 590.000 inhabitants. In 1929, Bandung approved the 'Framework plan' city planning, which covered an area of 12.758 ha, divided in plans for mainly the Northern- and partly the Southern areas of the town. This plan which followed the garden city concept was successfully applied in the Northern part of the town where most of the European population lived. The north part was designed with large public spaces, spacious and green residential areas in which public and private greens are integrated. The roads were fit out with, originally, a consequent planting of trees. But the valley of the river Cikapundung - which was ones fitted up as a park landscape (Ijzermanpark) is nowadays occupied by spontaneous kampung-settlements. The North part was divided in an Army area, a Governmental area, areas for dwelling houses and villas, small-housing for the common people and kampung-areas for the labor people. The Chinese inhabitants lived in the Pasar Baru quarter, southwest of the railroad. The natives lived in the Southern part of the town, like many of the Indo-Europeans. Coat of Arms of Bandung, adopted in 1928. Bandung's location, in a low area between two mountainous regions, is strategically advantageous for military defense. In the 1930s, the Dutch East Indies government had planned to move the capital from Batavia to Bandung, and built military barracks, a central government building (Gouvernments Bedrijven, nicknamed Gedung Sate), and several others. This plan did not come to fruition following the failure of the Dutch to reclaim Indonesia after World War II. =Growth of plantation areas= The fertile area of the Parahyangan mountains surrounding Bandung allowed for productive tea plantations. In the 19th century, cinchona (kina) plants were introduced by Franz Junghuhn. Cinchona is a plant that can be used for the treatment of malaria and the old pharmacy factory of cinchona still exists in the city. Bandung then developed itself into an exclusive European resort with hotels, cafes and shops. Rich plantation owners came during the weekends and so did girls and businessmen from the capital, Batavia. The promenade Braga Street grew into an elite area of cafes, restaurants and boutique shops. Two art-deco style hotels, Savoy Homann and Preanger, became two major accommodations there. The Concordia Society (now known as Merdeka Building) was built as a club house of these rich people, complete with a large ballroom and a theater. The title of \\"Parijs van Java\\" was given to this city. Struggle for Independence Gedung Merdeka during the Asian-African Conference in 1955 Bandung was decided as the provincial capital of West Java, after the independence. Since October 1945, there had been several extreme Islam groups in West Java with the main goal of establishing an Islamic state in Indonesia (Darul Islam). One of this movements was \\"Laskar Hitam\\" a militia group that kidnapped and killed Otto Iskandardinata, RI's Minister of State (1945). Other victims of similar groups: Poerdiredja, the regent of Priangan, Oekar Bratakoesoemah, the mayor of Bandung and Niti Soemantri, the leader of Indonesian national committee (KNI) in Priangan. Prior to the Dutch Politionele acties (\\"police action\\"), there was an ultimatum for the Indonesian combatants in Bandung to leave, given by the British military command, that temporarily (before the Dutch came back) tried to restore order. As for the answer, on March 24, 1946, the southern part of Bandung was deliberately burned down as they were leaving. This event is known as Bandung Lautan Api or \\"Bandung as the sea of flame\\". A heroic song \\"Halo-halo Bandung\\" was sung along by these hundreds of patriots. During the evacuation process of March 1946, a member of Indonesian militia Mohammad Toha smuggled several sticks of dynamite into a large scale ammunition dump guarded by Japanese and Dutch troops, near the Dutch military HQ in Dayeuh Kolot. After overpowering the guards, he put the dynamite in several warehouses full of ammunition. He then committed suicide by igniting the dynamite. The massive explosion killed him and several Dutch, Japanese troops in the area. The explosion created a small lake (\\"situ\\") in Dayeuh Kolot. The main street in the area is called \\"Mohammad Toha Street\\". Independence On January 23, 1950, a rebel group called the Just King Armed Forces (, APRA), led by Captain Raymond Westerling (a former Dutch military officer) and King Sultan Hamid II from Kalimantan (Borneo) attacked Indonesian army's Siliwangi Division HQ in Bandung. Lt. Col. Lembong and 93 other Indonesian soldiers and officers were killed. On January 24, 1950, the rebels tried to attack Jakarta, but the rebellion was quashed in a fierce battle in Pacet, near Jakarta. Sultan Hamid II was arrested, but Capt. Westerling managed to escape to Singapore. In 1955, the first Asian- African Conference () was held in Bandung. Twenty-nine countries attended the conference. The Asian-African leaders who attended the summit included Nehru (India), Nasser (Egypt), Tito (Yugoslavia), Nkrumah (Ghana), U Nu (Myanmar), and others. This conference is one of the preparation for the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement block in Beograd (former Yugoslavia) in 1961. After being elected in 1955, a new parliament body called the Constitutional Assembly (), was established. It was tasked with creating new constitution to replace the Provisional Constitution of 1950. This new body held meetings in Bandung for several years without any result. The Constituent Assembly was dissolved by President Sukarno in a decree issued on July 5, 1959, which also reinstated the 1945 Constitution. On May 10, 1963, a minor traffic accident (collision between 2 motorcycles) occurred in the campus of Bandung Institute of Technology. Two ITB students were involved in this accident: an ethnic Chinese student and an Indonesian student. The traffic accident turned into a racial brawl on the basketball field. The leaders of \\"Dewan Mahasiswa\\" (DM)/student council at ITB such as Muslimin Nasution (later becoming a government minister), Siswono Yudo Husodo (later becoming a government minister), and Sutjipto (later becoming a leader of PKS party) used this event as the start of a movement against the establishment of ethnic Chinese tribe by Baperki (an ethnic Chinese organization influenced by Indonesian Communist Party/PKI). This movement was also directed against NASAKOM (Nasionalis, Agama dan Komunis) ideology from President Sukarno. The movement disagree with the Communist part of NASAKOM and they assumed that all ethnic Chinese community supported Baperki/Indonesian Communist Party. The next day, there was a large scale public demonstration by this movement against Baperki and ethnic Chinese. Unfortunately there are other organizations/people who use this event to start a large scale racial riot in Bandung that spread to other cities: Jogjakarta, Surabaya, Malang and Medan. Muslimin Nasution and other leaders of Student Council were arrested by Police. Muslimin was sentenced to 3 years in prison for starting the riot. On September 30, 1965, there was a failed coup attempt by revolutionary council (aka G30S). The Military Chief Of Staff, General Nasution escaped and went to Bandung for protection from the loyal Siliwangi division. According to General Nasution, near his mother residence in Bandung, members of Indonesian communist party (PKI) also dig new wells for burying their enemies. On September 6, 1970 there was a football match between ITB students and cadets from Military academy. The game ended in a riot and brawl. Rene L. Conrad, an ITB student, was kidnapped and murdered by the Military cadets. Unfortunately the case remain unsolved today. In 1976, Doctor Habibie (later becoming Indonesian President) established a state owned, aircraft manufacturing company called Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). Later this company was renamed into PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PT DI). In 1978, after a People Consultative Assembly session in Jakarta, there were demonstrations against the re-election of President Soeharto by ITB students. Police disbanded the \\"Dewan Mahasiswa\\" (Student council) movement in ITB and the leaders were arrested. The university was closed for 3 months and the new Minister of Education announced \\"Normalization of University Life\\" (NKK) to quell the student movement. On March 11, 1981, an extreme Moslem group called \\"Jamaah Imron\\" attacked Cicendo police station in Bandung. The movement was quashed by Indonesian police, but several members escaped to Medan, North Sumatra and hijacked Garuda airplane to Bangkok 2 weeks later. The passengers and crews were rescued by Indonesian special force in the Don Muang airport, Bangkok, Thailand. The pilot and a soldier were shot death during the rescue attempt. From April 5, 1982 to January 8, 1983, there were several eruptions at Mt Galunggung in Tasikmalaya and Bandung was buried in several inches of ash. 21st century On December 24, 2000, there were bomb attacks against churches in Bandung. The bombs exploded prematurely and the perpetrators were arrested. On February 21, 2005, a landslide occurred at the garbage dumpsite in Leuwigajah, Bandung. 143 people were killed by the landslide. After this fatal accident, the Leuwigajah dumpsite was closed and Bandung had a major problem in garbage management. The entire city was turned into a giant garbage dump (\\"kota sampah\\"). The mayor of Bandung was unable to solve the problem and the governor of West Java was forced to search for new garbage dumpsites. Fortunately the problem is solved now. Today, Bandung has grown beyond its city core with the Bandung Raya plan. Traffic in Bandung is infamous with its complex, congested and chaotic nature. The city core is practically uprooted, old faces are torn down, lot sizes regrouped, and what was idyllic residence is now bustling chain supermarkets and rich banks. However Bandung is always a weekend break destination for people living in Jakarta. A new Cipularang highway was recently completed, reducing travel time from Jakarta. The major attraction to come to Bandung is the food and fashion shopping. The food in Bandung is well known for their wide varieties and taste. Bandung is also a place to do fashion shopping with its numerous factory outlets and stock centres.

Reconstructed moa. The museum holds the world's largest collection of moa remains. The Otago Museum is located in the city centre of Dunedin, New Zealand. It is adjacent to the University of Otago campus in Dunedin North, 1,500 metres northeast of the city centre. It is one of the city's leading attractions and has one of the largest museum collections in New Zealand. Natural science specimens and humanities artefacts from Otago, New Zealand and the world form the basis for long-term gallery displays. An interactive science centre within the Museum includes a large, immersive tropical butterfly rainforest environment. History =Origins= The name \\"Otago Museum\\" was first used by James Hector to describe his geological collections on display at the 1865 New Zealand Exhibition, held in Dunedin. Some of these collections were the nucleus of the Otago Museum, which first opened to the public on 12 September 1868. The museum was originally located in the Dunedin Exchange building on Princes Street. As the collection began to grow, it soon became clear that a larger, purpose-built site was required; the foundation was laid at the current Great King Street site in December 1874. In August 1877, the new building was opened and remains a part of the Museum today. The original entrance to the Museum, with its Oamaru stone Doric-style pillars, is still visible on Great King Street, though the main entrance is now from the Museum Reserve. Interior of Otago Museum, between 1883 and 1886, by Burton Brothers studio, featuring a fin whale skeleton (mounted 1883) and a spirit collection of fish and reptiles. Management of the Museum passed to the University of Otago in 1877. This arrangement lasted until 1955 when a new governance structure was established by the passing of the Otago Museum Trust Board Act. =Architecture and Development= With well over 100 years‚Äô history on the current site, the Museum building is classified by the Historic Places Trust as a Category 1 historic place. The first substantial addition to the original Museum building on the Great King Street site was the Hocken Wing, which opened in 1910, housing Dr Thomas Hocken's collection of manuscripts. This collection now forms the basis of the Hocken Collections. Another new wing, named for benefactor Willi Fels was opened in 1930 and today houses the People of the World and Tangata Whenua galleries. A further expansion of the Museum occurred in 1963 when the Centennial Wing was opened to provide additional display space. With all of these separate developments, the Museum had grown to several times its original floor area, resulting in a confusing layout of multiple internally connected wings. A multi-stage redevelopment project in the 1990s and 2000s largely resolved this, with the addition of architect Ted McCoy's spectacular integrating central Atrium. The collection storage area was also redeveloped with specialised shelving and environmentally controlled storerooms. The redevelopment project reached a milestone in 2002 when the Southern Land, Southern People gallery was opened by Sir Edmund Hillary, along with the Governor General (then Dame Silvia Cartwright) and Prime Minister (then Helen Clark). The Exchange Building, original home of the Otago Museum The Museum's interactive science centre, Discovery World, opened In 1991. During the redevelopment it was moved from its original ground floor location to the first floor. The Tropical Forest, an immersive butterfly rainforest environment featuring the flora and fauna of the tropics, opened as a major addition to the science centre in 2007. Discovery World Tropical Forest has become an important visitor attraction in its own right. A planetarium was a further addition to the science centre in 2015. During 2017 the science centre was further redeveloped, and opened in December of that year as the 'T≈´hura Otago Community Trust Science Centre'. 2013 saw the opening of a redeveloped historic bluestone building on the Museum Reserve, which serves as an exhibition space and additional Museum venue. The building, now named the H. D. Skinner Annex after museum director Harry Skinner, was formerly a post office. alt= =Benefactors= Largely due to generous benefactors and judicious acquisition strategies, the Otago Museum has one of the most significant museum collections in New Zealand. Many of the Museum's key benefactors were part of the same eminent Dunedin family. Among them, German- born businessman Willi Fels had an especially long and impactful relationship with the Museum. Fels contributed many items personally, as well as establishing a purchasing fund, facilitating acquisitions made by others, and encouraging others to pass on valuable items to the Museum. He also coordinated the fundraising efforts for the construction of the wing ultimately named in his honour. =The Museum‚Äôs collection= In natural science, the Museum's holdings in insect and type specimens are internationally significant, with the spider collections including specimens from the wider Pacific area as well as a representative collection of arachnids from around the world. Marine invertebrate specimens number in the 40,000s, while 30,000 bird specimens (including nests and eggs) are held. The moa collection is among the world's best, with two out of the three complete moa eggs in the world held, the Ettrick Egg and the First Earnscleugh Egg. In the humanities, the collection has strengths in both everyday and art items from all over Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia and Australia, as well as an extensive collection of MƒÅori taoka. From the rest of the world, the broad ethnographic collections include particularly significant collections of edged weapons and armour from India, ancient coins from the classical world, Islamic ceramics, and Ashanti goldweights. The museum also has some 150 cuneiform tablets and inscriptions in its collection, the largest known collection of its type in the southern hemisphere. Wide-ranging collections of pottery, jewellery, costume, glassware, clocks, furniture, stamps, guns, cameras, and stone tools are also held. Governance and funding The Museum is governed by the Otago Museum Trust Board with roles, responsibilities and selection of appointing bodies determined by the Otago Museum Trust Board Act 1996. The Otago Museum Annual Plan 2018/19 states that over half of the Museum's operational budget comes from \\"individual donations, commercial activity, corporate sponsorship, targeted government funding, and contracted services.\\" The remainder of funding comes from the four contributing local authorities - the Dunedin City Council, the Clutha District Council, the Central Otago District Council and the Waitaki District Council. The calculation of each local authority's contribution is outlined in the Otago Museum Trust Board Act 1996. Leadership During the years that the University of Otago was responsible for managing the Museum, the role of Curator formed part of an academic position. Frederick Hutton, formerly the Otago Provincial Geologist, was a lecturer in both Zoology and Geology at the University of Otago, and was the Otago Museum Curator from 1873-79. Hutton supervised the design of the original building on the Great King Street site and began to assemble a significant natural history collection. His successor, Thomas Jeffery Parker, was an outstanding researcher and one of New Zealand's greatest biologists. During his tenure (1880‚Äì1897) he organised the natural history specimens along Darwinian lines and articulated many of the skeletons still on display in the Animal Attic. The humanities collection was started during Parker's time, prompted by the donation of an ancient Egyptian mummy by Bendix Hallenstein. Spanning the 19th and 20th centuries was Sir William Blaxland Benham, a scientist of world renown, who was appointed Curator in 1898. He held the position for 39 years, while also holding the University of Otago Chair of Biology. Benham was knighted for his contribution to science and education in 1939. The first New Zealand born leader of the Museum was Henry Devenish Skinner, who was first appointed in 1937. Skinner was a pioneer in the field of anthropology in New Zealand, and is considered by many to have inaugurated Pacific anthropology. While Skinner's predecessors had focused primarily on the natural science collection, Skinner skilfully built the humanities collection, working closely with friend and major benefactor Willi Fels. In 1957, Raymond Robert Forster became the first new Director appointed under the Otago Museum Trust Board Act. Forster ushered in a period of intense research in the biological sciences at the Museum. Becoming a world authority on the biology and classification of spiders, Forster brought together a significant arachnid collection, with representative species from around the world. Richard Cassels became Director after Forster in 1987, and began a process of focusing the Museum on its responsibilities to the wider community. During Cassels‚Äô time as Director, the Museum Trust Board made a commitment to the establishment of a science centre. Shimrath Paul was appointed Director in 1995, after joining the team in 1990 to set up the Museum's interactive science centre (Discovery World). Paul oversaw a comprehensive multi- stage redevelopment, which, along with a renewed focus on visitor experience, transformed the Museum into a hub for the local community and a world-class visitor attraction. The redevelopment also addressed collection storage, which now reflects international best practice. Under Paul's leadership, the Museum's Tropical Forest, a three-level indoor butterfly rainforest experience, was also completed in 2007. During Paul's tenure, visitor numbers increased from around 250,000 per annum, peaking at over 600,000. In 2012, Paul resigned after ongoing controversy over his level of pay and staff morale. Dr Ian Griffin, the Museum's eighth Director, was appointed to the role in May 2013. With a PhD in astronomy and the discovery of 27 asteroids among his accomplishments, Ian brings a strong scientific background to the Museum. Ian's last role before joining the Museum was as Chief Executive of the Oxford Trust in Oxford, England ‚Äì a charitable foundation encouraging the pursuit of science. His other previous roles have included Director of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, England; Head of Office of Public Outreach and Director NASA Origins Education Forum Space Telescope Science Institute; and CEO of the Auckland Observatory and Planetarium Trust. Ian has also been appointed an honorary fellow in the University of Otago Physics Department. Galleries and Exhibitions The T≈´hura Tropical Forest is an immersive three-storey attraction featuring many species of tropical butterfly and other tropical fauna and flora. =Long-term galleries= Otago Museum has seven long-term galleries: * Southern Land, Southern People: geological and natural history of Otago; natural resources as used by the people of the south; a plesiosaur fossil, considered to be New Zealand's largest fossil specimen, is a feature exhibit. * Tangata Whenua: MƒÅori taoka (treasures/artefacts), with a focus on Southern MƒÅori. * The Nature gallery: natural science specimens and stories from Otago, including an historic moa diorama. * Animal Attic: a Victorian-inspired zoological gallery, with nearly 3,000 historical specimens, including the Lawrence lions, a male and female lion which escaped from a travelling circus in the town of Lawrence in 1978. * People of the World: humanities artefacts from all over the world, including an ancient Egyptian mummy. * Pacific Cultures: masks, tools, weapons and more from the islands and cultures of Polynesia and Melanesia. * The Maritime gallery: maritime history of Otago and New Zealand with over 50 model ships and an historic fin whale skeleton. Alongside the galleries, another long-term offering is: * T≈´hura Otago Community Trust Science Centre, the Museum's interactive science centre. The centre has two distinct sections: the first explores science (primarily physics and technology) through interactive exhibits; the second is an immersive rainforest experience. Known as the Tropical Forest, it houses hundreds of exotic, live butterflies, as well as other tropical flora and fauna, in a three-level environment with a six-metre waterfall. =Exhibitions= The Museum's large Special Exhibitions Gallery on Level 1 is its primary display area for temporary exhibitions on wide-ranging themes. Temporary exhibitions are also displayed in other parts of the Museum, including the Atrium end of the People of the World gallery. Some exhibitions are developed in-house, while others tour from elsewhere in New Zealand or the world. Associations and partnerships with international museums have brought world class exhibitions to Otago, and seen Otago Museum exhibitions reach wide audiences. For example, the Shanghai Museum sent The Emperor‚Äôs Dragons to Otago Museum in 2008; with dragon motifs as its theme, the exhibition included ancient artefacts never previously seen outside of China. As an exchange exhibition, Otago Museum sent Te Ao MƒÅori: MƒÅori Treasures from the Otago Museum, New Zealand to Shanghai in 2011. It was the first exhibition of MƒÅori artefacts in a Chinese museum. Te Ao MƒÅori was visited by over 600,000 people. Community Programmes and Education Thousands of school students visit the Otago Museum every year for curriculum-based programmes relating to galleries or exhibitions. The Museum also offers a popular ‚Äòsleepover‚Äô programme to school groups. A portable planetarium (‚ÄòStarlab‚Äô) provides astronomy experiences both onsite or at schools in the region. A wide range of community programmes and events that complement the exhibitions and galleries are also organised by the Otago Museum. Offerings, which are often free, include family fun days, workshops, guest speakers, film screenings, children's activities and daily gallery talks. The Museum lists upcoming programmes on its website. Functions and Events The Museum has a range of spaces that are regularly hired for conferences, meetings, dinners, receptions, balls and cocktail parties. This is one of the ways that the Museum is able to raise funds to contribute to the operating budget.

After working for a time at Guy‚Äôs Hospital, he returned to America and again settled in Philadelphia, where he soon gained great celebrity. While there he gained membership in the American Philosophical Society through his election in 1768.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, 3:137‚Äì144. Many of Philadelphia's leading doctors studied under him, including John Morgan, Benjamin Rush, and Caspar Wistar. In 1784 he was elected an elder of the Second Presbyterian Church. He was a man of small stature, of good sense and learning, and much respected in his day. He became independently wealthy, and retired from business many years before his death. He used to visit his old friends and acquaintances after he became infirm from age, on a fat pony mare. Dr. James Rush says, \\"I remember him well hitching her to the turnbuckle of the mansion shutter, so that she always stood on the foot-pavement, where he visited my father, which he made it a point to do once or twice a year. In the rough cutting of his likeness, which was given to me by a member of his family, the hat, wig, nose, mouth, chin, eye, dress, person, expression, and character are admirably true. The mare is not so well done. The doctor retired from practice about 1785, and was known to the public as an antiquated-looking old gentleman. He was usually habited in a broad-skirted dark coat, with long pocket-flaps, buttoned across his under dress, and wearing, in strict conformity to the cut of the coat, a pair of Baron Steuben‚Äôs military-shaped boots, coming above the knees.\\" Mr. Watson says, for riding-habit, \\"his hat flapped before and cocked up smartly behind, covering a full-bottomed powdered wig, in the front of which might be seen an eagle-pointed nose, separating a pair of piercing black eyes, his lips exhibiting, but only now and then, a quick motion, as though at the moment he was endeavoring to extract the essence of a small quid. As thus described in habit and in person, he was to be seen almost daily, in fair weather, mounted on a short, fat, black, switch- tailed mare, and riding for his amusement and exercise, in a brisk racking canter, about the streets and suburbs of the city.\\" He died of apoplexy, March 19, 1808, in the same house in which he lived for more than half a century, on Second Street, about one-third of a square from Arch, on the west side, next to Dr. Ustick's Baptist Church. He was predeceased by his youngest daughter, in 1806, and his wife.

The class of the title is the Harvard University Class of 1958. The book is about five fictional members of this class: Andrew Eliot, Jason Gilbert, Theodore Lambros, Daniel Rossi, and George Keller. Plot summary The Class follows the diverse fates of five members of Harvard's Class of 1958, recording the way their lives intertwine, and coming to a dramatic conclusion at their class reunion, twenty-five years later. Andrew Eliot comes from the Boston Brahmin Eliot family. Due to his background, he always feels the pressure of high expectations, and suffers from a lack of confidence as a result. He is otherwise laid-back and friendly, and a good friend to all his classmates. To experience life without privilege and to fulfill his military obligation, he serves in the navy as an ordinary swabbie. After his military service, he makes an ill-fated marriage to the daughter of one of his father's classmates and takes up a career in investment banking. Unfortunately, his wife is a serial adultress and alcoholic and demands a divorce, leaving him estranged from his own son and daughter, with limited visitation after his wife places both in boarding school at the age of 9 and 6, denying him custodial rights and frustrating his attempts to give them a home life. He has an interest in his family's history during the American Revolution, which in turn leads to him following his conscience and helping organize the Moratorium Day protests on Wall Street. Jason Gilbert, Jr., son of Jason Gilbert, Sr. n√© Jacob Gruenwald, has the makings of a perfect son, of whom any parent would be proud. Despite this, there is one thing that troubles him: he is in constant conflict with his identity as a Jew, despite his parents' assimilation and conversion to Unitarianism. He experiences prejudice at several points, when denied admission to Yale and when denied invitation to the punches of Harvard's final clubs. He also notes more pervasive racism, when a popular black athlete is denied entrance to the Hasty Pudding Club, and when a drill instructor punishes him during his service in the Marines when he inadvertently invites him to a segregated restaurant off-base, which the drill instructor interpreted as taunting. Over the course of the book, he overcomes this, due to the loss of his Dutch Christian fianc√©e, a paediatrician who is killed while attending a sick kibbutznik child during a visit to Israel. The incident leads him to immigrate to Israel and become a kibbutznik himself and join the Israeli paratroopers, in exploring the Jewish identity that had been denied to him throughout his life by his family's assimilation while being externally imposed on him. He is shown as participating in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, and dies during the rescue of Jewish hostages from Uganda. Theodore Lambros was born to a working class Greek family, and was admitted to Harvard with no scholarship after graduating from Cambridge Latin School, and thus must work as a waiter to support himself throughout his schooling, and does not have the wherewithal to live on campus. During the course of the book, this fact makes it difficult for him to truly \\"belong\\" to his class. All the same, he endures and eventually achieves his ambition of securing a professorship in the classics at Harvard. Tragically, he has no one to share it with, after committing adultery while on sabbatical at Christ Church, and his subsequent divorce from his college sweetheart. Daniel Rossi is a talented pianist. His father disowns him due to his choice of Harvard in light of President Pusey's refusal to cooperate with the McCarthy hearings, particularly after the death of his older son in the Korean War. Daniel chooses Harvard on the advice of his mentor in music, Gustav Landau, who likens the McCarthy persecutions to those of the Third Reich which he himself fled. Daniel eventually wins his father's approval due to his success and fame as a pianist, composer of a Broadway musical and conductor of two orchestras, but finds this acceptance meaningless after years of estrangement. However, to maintain this extremely hectic way of life, he becomes alienated from his wife, and a serial adulterer addicted to stimulants and phenothiazine. The drug addiction becomes his downfall and causes severe motor dysfunction that ends his musical career, but redeems him through allowing him to reconcile with his wife and daughters. George Keller, n√© Gyuri Kolozsdi, enters the United States as a Hungarian refugee following the student uprising in 1956, and is granted a place in the Harvard Class of 1958. He rushes to assimilate as quickly as possible and becomes fluent in English in seven months. He remains highly paranoid and deeply regrets his abandonment of his fianc√©e, a Budapest pharmacy student, in the rush to flee Hungary. His determination and fierce loyalty to his country of refuge eventually result in a position in the White House, as a prot√©g√© of Henry Kissinger. His personal detachment and unresolved emotions leave him unable to form any meaningful relationship with his wife or to consider becoming a father, and they eventually divorce. After a lengthy speech at his 25th class reunion, where he is confronted with the human toll of his policy implementation in the Vietnam War, he commits suicide, asking Andrew Eliot, as his executor, that his money be sent back to his family in Hungary.

Broadway World, by Taylor Long Jul. 11, 2017 One member of the cast plays the part of Bishop in word and song, although he is also called upon to dramatize 17 other parts; the second cast member provides all the accompaniment on the piano and also sings. History Gray and Peterson developed the music and storyline of the musical in 1978, when they were both 32. Collaborative rehearsals took place in stage designer Paul Williams' studio in Toronto. =Productions with the original cast= The play premiered at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre co- produced by Tamahnous Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia on November 3, 1978. Peterson played 18 different characters, and Gray accompanied on piano and vocals. The original production toured across Canada, and also was staged in Washington, DC, both on Broadway and off-Broadway in New York City, at the Edinburgh Festival, in Los Angeles and at the Comedy Theatre in London. During the international tour, a second production, starring Cedric Smith with musical accompaniment by Ross Douglas, continued touring across Canada.

Excerpts from the play also appear in the National Film Board of Canada documentary, The Kid Who Couldn't Miss. Reception Canadian critics have generally been enthusiastic, both about the original production, and of the various revivals brought forth by Peterson and Gray. In 2009, Eye Weekly critic Christopher Hoile observed, \\"The achievement of the piece is in formulating, perhaps for the first time, what a Canadian hero is like... Peterson and Gray emphasize not only how accidental Bishop's heroism is but how aware he is of his oafishness and his luck.\\" Hoile went on to call the play \\"a Canadian classic that deserves the name...\\" In 2010, Toronto Star theatre critic Richard Ouzounian called it a \\"brilliant examination... One of the great works in the Canadian theatre canon.\\" Awards The play won the Los Angeles Drama Critics' Award in 1981, the Floyd S.

Cory operates in nearly 40 locations throughout England, providing services in the collection, recycling and disposal of waste. Operations Cory Environmental is one of the UK's leading resource management, recycling and energy recovery companies. It handles more than 3.5 million tonnes of waste and recyclable materials per year at sites across the UK and has contracts for recycling, street cleansing and waste collection. It may be best known for operating barges on the River Thames from central London to Cory's Riverside Resource Recovery, Energy from Waste facility in Bexley. Using London's green highway to transfer waste by barge removes 100,000 lorry movements per year from London's roads. History =Coal and refuse= The company was founded in London in 1896 as William Cory and Son Ltd. Cory was formed from the merger of eight companies in the coal trade and had a comprehensive business in transporting and supplying five million tonnes of coal per year to trade and domestic customers in London. Cory had a fleet of 2,500 railway wagons and also operated lighters on the River Thames. Rather than operate its lighters unladen on their return journeys from delivering coal, Cory used them to carry refuse from London to be dumped in the marshlands of Essex and Kent. After the turn of the 20th century, Cory started to provide social housing for some of its workforce. SS Nellie Wise aground at Hartlepool in 1908 SS William Cory aground at Pendeen in 1910 Cory ships had brown upper works above hull level.Talbot-Booth, 1942, page 611 The funnel was black with a broad white band, and a large black diamond on the white band.Harnack, 1938, plate 30, between pages 612‚Äì613 The house flag was red with a large white or cream diamond in the middle.

In 1896 Cory bought the 1,053 GRT coaster SS Nellie Wise, which Denton Gray & Co of West Hartlepool had built in 1873. On 8 January 1908 while en route from London to the River Tyne she ran aground on Blackhall Rocks northwest of Hartlepool. She was refloated but sold for scrap. In 1909 S.P. Austin & Co. built the 2,660 GRT coaster SS William Cory for the company. She ran aground at Pendeen in Cornwall and was wrecked in September 1910. =First World War= During the First World War the War Department requisitioned most of Cory's tugs for the Royal Navy. In 1914 Cory encouraged its workers to enlist in Kitchener's Army, and they formed an entire company of the 6th battalion, the Royal East Kent Regiment (The Buffs) as a pals' unit. Cory cargo ships sailed usually coastal convoys but sometimes independently. The company lost 15 ships: 13 were confirmed sunk by enemy action, one disappeared and was presumed sunk by enemy action and one was sunk by a collision. 94 seafarers were killed and numerous others were injured. SS Deptford was a 1,208 GRT collier built by Blyth Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. in 1912.

Survivors were rescued by another Cory ship, SS Cormull. By the 1950s Cory was transporting and supplying fuel oil as well as coal. In 1956 Cory started to develop a fleet of barges designed specifically to carry refuse rather than coal. Cory had its own barge-building yard, which produced more than 400 such vessels between 1962 and 1972. Oil-fired central heating grew in popularity such that by 1972 Cory was supplying per year to domestic customers. In the 1960s and 1970s William Cory was operating general and refrigerated road haulage out of Palmers Wharf, Deptford. The colours were white with the black lozenge. Later on it was taken over by Ocean and renamed McGregor Cory Cargo Services and the vehicles became red. They gradually got involved with the emerging container traffic and worked for OCL who were taking over refrigerated imports from New Zealand and Australia. As containers were mostly arriving in Tilbury docks, MCCS moved to Thurrock and Barking, Essex. This was the final end of the link with Deptford Cory tug Resource towing barges of waste down the Thames In 1972 Ocean Group plc bought Cory. In 1979 Cory bought Thames and General Lighterage, making Cory the largest waste carrier on the Thames. In the 1980s Cory withdrew from coal and oil distribution to concentrate on waste transport and disposal. In 1981 two Cory group companies were merged to form Cory Waste Management. Cory Environmental Municipal Services Ltd was formed in 1989 and the two companies were merged as Cory Environmental in 1990. In 1997 Cory Environmental grew by buying Local Authority Waste Disposal Companies from Essex County Council and Gloucestershire County Council. In 1999 Cory bought Parkhill Reclamation, increasing Cory's presence in the West Midlands and North West England. In 2000 Ocean Group plc merged with NFC plc to form Exel plc, which in 2005 sold Cory to Montagu Private Equity. In March 2007 Montagu sold Cory to a consortium of investors consisting of ABN Amro Global Infrastructure Fund, Finpro SGPS and Santander Private Equity. In 2012 Cory Environmental was awarded an eight-year contract to provide the waste collection services throughout the county of Cornwall. On 10 June 2015, it was announced that Biffa had bought the Cory waste collection business, Cory Environmental Municipal Services Limited for ¬£13.5 Million.

Biography He grew up at a farm in Utskarpen in Rana, and took his military education in Harstad at the Norwegian 6th Division Under- Officers' Training School. He was of sergeant rank when Norway was invaded by Germany on 9 April 1940. His garrison was ordered to fight with the outbreak of the Narvik campaign. Bratland first fought in the Battle of Gratangen. In the next month he was stationed in Bod√∏, where he was wounded during a German air attack. He fled to England via Sweden in 1942, and was subsequently commissioned into the British Army, in the 4th Battalion of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. He would serve in Normandy, landing on 13 June 1944. He was injured in the Battle for Caen, but quickly returned to the field. On 22 September 1944, during the crossing of key canals in the Netherlands, Bratland led a platoon attack near Asten, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. When approaching Germany, he headed a company. However he was gravely injured on 5 April 1945, and remained hospitalized until the war's end. Bratland was also awarded the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch and the Defence Medal as well as the British War Medal 1939‚Äì1945 and Defence Medal. He was appointed Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1980. He went on to have a successful career in the Norwegian army after the war. He served as battalion chief of the Brigade in South Norway from 1961 to 1964, then chief of staff in Northern Norway. He then served as acting chief of staff of the NATO North Command before serving as commander of ground forces in South Norway from 1977 to 1982. He attained the rank of Colonel in 1966 and Major-General in 1972. After retirement he worked part-time at the Norwegian Military Academy. He also visited Normandy several times with various delegations. He died in 2002.

Such arrows are particularly useful when shooting at aerial targets or for certain types of recreational archery where the arrow must not travel too far. One of the main uses of these arrows is that they do not get lost as easily if they miss the target. A flu-flu is a design of fletching, normally made by using long sections of feathers; in most cases six or more sections are used, rather than the traditional three. Alternatively, two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the arrow shaft. In either case, the excessive fletching serves to generate more drag and slow the arrow down rapidly after a short distance (about ). Recreational flu-flus usually have rubber points to add weight and keep the flight slower.  Uses  Flu- flu arrows were and still are used to hunt birds. When taking aim at the bird the archer must lead the bird and release the arrow in anticipation of the bird's travel path. Because flu-flu arrows fly short distances, it is easy for the archer to recover the arrow if the target is missed. Special bird points are used that entangle the bird as it flies into a wire harness attached to the end of the arrow. These arrows often have a blunt point. If shooting at squirrels or other tree dwellers, the blunt point will prevent the arrow from sticking in the branch or trunk of the tree, making it easier to retrieve. The blunt points were also used for other reasons. \\"Although the first game preserves in England were established by William the Conqueror at this time, the Saxon was permitted to shoot birds and small beasts in his fields and therefore was allowed to use a blunt arrow, headed with a lead tip or pilum, hence our term pile, or target point. If found with a sharp arrowhead, the so- called broad-head used for killing the king's deer, he was promptly hanged.\\"Pope, S. T. (1923). Hunting with the bow & arrow. San Francisco: The James H. Barry Co. Another author said: \\"After shooting with bows and arrows for a short time, the archer no doubt will marvel at the way an arrow can lose itself in even the shortest grass and how a pointed arrow can bury itself for or so in a tree trunk or branch so that it takes a half-hour or more to dig it out. For this kind of shooting, blunt arrows cannot be beat. These blunt arrows have tremendous hitting power. They do not sneak under the grass as easily as do other arrows, but the chances of getting a rabbit with a blunt arrow are much better than with a hunting point. These blunt arrows will stand a lot of hard knocks too.\\"Hunt, W. Ben & John J. Metz. 1936. The Flat Bow. Flu-flu arrows are often used for children's archery, and can be used to play flu-flu golf. Similar to Frisbee Golf, the player must go to where the arrow landed, pick it up, shoot it again, and repeat this process until he reaches a specified place.

The Times, Friday, Feb 13, 1948; pg. 2; Issue 50994 and produced by The Rover Company Limited until the (northern) summer of 1949. Two months after the announcement of the new cars \\"a new vehicle for agriculture\\" was announced, the Land-Rover, with the engine of the new Sixty. Overview For the post-war market Rover had a new engine that had been in preparation since the late 1930s with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. It was made in two versions for the car, the Rover 60 had a four-cylinder unit of 1595 cc and the Rover 75 had a six-cylinder version of 2103 cc. The gearbox and traditional Rover freewheel were kept unchanged from the previous model. To go with the engine a new car was prepared. Although the body was similar in styling to the Rover 12 and 16, many of the body panels were in fact new but the wings and bonnet from the 12 were carried over. The car was 0.5 inch (12 mm) wider outside than the 16 but by making better use of space this translated to 2.5 inches (60 mm) inside. It was 4.5 inches (115 mm) shorter in the wheelbase. Also new, and a first for a Rover, was independent front suspension but the brakes remained a hydraulic/mechanical hybrid system. Rather than having a complete chassis, the new frame, which was a box section, was stopped short of the rear axle and the rear semi-elliptic springs were attached to the body. This allowed the rear axle travel to be increased and an improved ride resulted. Two body styles were available, a 6-light saloon and 4-light sports saloon. The 6-light saloon had a rear quarter window (sometimes referred to a 6-window saloon) while the 4-light sports saloon had the lack of the rear quarter window (sometimes referred to a 4-window saloon). The cars were expensive at ¬£1080 for the Rover 60 and ¬£1106 for the Rover 75, and with early post-war production problems and material shortages it was never intended that the cars would be produced in large numbers. Eventually, 1274 of 60 and 7837 75 models were made before the car was replaced by the all-new Rover 75 (P4) at the end of September 1949. Powertrain The engine and gearbox from the car were also used as the basis for those in the original Land Rover Series. About six \\"75\\" models were produced with triple SU carburettors ‚Äì a throw back to Rover's pre-war 'Speed' performance models; one survivor has an over-bored 2,400 cc engine; the basis of the Marauder 100 engine.

Like its predecessor, the X1, the X8 system included core memory, 27-bit word length, and drum memory as secondary storage (not as primary storage). The memory address was increased from 15 to 18 bits, for a theoretical maximum memory size of 256k words. The X8 included an independent peripheral processor called CHARON (Centraal Hulporgaan Autonome Regeling Overdracht Nevenapparatuur, or Central Coprocessor Autonomous Regulation Transfer Peripherals) which handled I/O. Other features included up to 48 input/output channels designed for low speed devices such as paper tape, plotters and printers. Unlike the X1, the arithmetic unit of the X8 included floating point arithmetic, with a 41-bit mantissa and 12-bit exponent (which adds up to 53 bits rather than 54; the reason is that there are two copies of the mantissa sign bit). The system is most notable as the target processor for Edsger Dijkstra's implementation of the THE multiprogramming system. This includes the invention of semaphores, enabled by a specific instruction in the X8 instruction set. Semaphores were used not only as a synchronization mechanism within the THE operating system, but also in the request and response data structures for I/O requests processed by the CHARON coprocessor.

Accessed 29 August 2008. Much of the first fifty years of the Department of State concerned negotiating with imperial European powers over the territorial integrity of the borders of the United States as known today. The first overseas consulate of the fledgling United States was founded in 1790 at Liverpool, Great Britain, by James Maury Jr., who was appointed by Washington. Maury held the post from 1790 to 1829. Liverpool was at the time Britain's leading port for transatlantic commerce and therefore of great economic importance to the United States. President George Washington, on November 19, 1792, nominated Benjamin Joy of Newbury Port as the first U.S. Consul to Kolkata (then Calcutta), India. Joy was not recognized as consul by the British East India Company but was permitted to ‚Äúreside here as a Commercial Agent subject to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction of this Country‚Ä¶‚Äù. The first overseas property owned, and the longest continuously owned, by the United States is the American Legation in Tangier, which was a gift of the Sultan of Morocco in 1821. In general during the nineteenth century, the United States' diplomatic activities were done on a minimal budget. The U.S. owned no property abroad and provided no official residences for its foreign envoys, paid them a minimal salary, and gave them the rank of ministers rather than ambassadors who represented the great powers‚Äîa position which the U.S. only achieved towards the end of the nineteenth century. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the State Department was concerned with expanding commercial ties in Asia, establishing Liberia, foiling diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and securing its presence in North America. The Confederacy had diplomatic missions in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Papal States, Russia, Mexico, and Spain, and consular missions in Ireland, Canada, Cuba, Italy, Bermuda, and Nassau and New Providence. The United States' global prominence became evident in the twentieth century, and the State Department was required to invest in a large network of diplomatic missions to manage its bilateral and multilateral relations.United States Department of State, Websites of U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions .

The cathedral is a national monument. Bazas was the seat of the Bishop of Bazas until the French Revolution (after which it was not restored but was instead, by the Concordat of 1801, divided between the dioceses of Bordeaux, Agen and Aire) and its main attraction is still the cathedral dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, so named because the blood of John the Baptist was venerated here. The cathedral dominates the town and stands at the east end of a wide, open space called the parvis. The cathedral dates mainly from the 13th-14th centuries, and was built on the model of the great Gothic cathedrals of northern France. The west front is unique with its three noticeable levels: the first includes the three Gothic portals retaining part of their original 13th-century sculpture; the second includes the rose window from 1537; and the third is a Neoclassical gable from 1723. The belfry on the north is part 11th century up to the openings. The interior consists of a long, narrow nave, with no transept, and was entirely rebuilt from 1583-1635 after the Huguenots badly damaged it in 1561 during the Wars of Religion.

Various families used it thus, including the Kaimals of Koratti, Angi and Koddachery. Portuguese ascendancy The Fifth Portuguese India Armada under Afonso de Albuquerque arrived in 1503, just in time to save the Cochin king from the Zamorin of Calicut. The Portuguese then turned their attention to the chieftains who had fought against the Cochin and committed many atrocities where they killed inhabitants in large numbers and indiscriminately burnt downtowns and villages. The Portuguese impressed upon the king the need to deal with his chiefs and entered into a treaty with the Anchi Kaimals whereby they accepted the overlordship of the Cochin throne. Dutch in Cochin On 26 October 1662, the Dutch re-engaged the Portuguese and with the help of the Anchi Kaimals took complete possession of Cochin from the Portuguese. T. I. Poonen says Dynasty Kaimal The term is derived from Kai which in the Malayalam language means hand, signifying power. Earlier Kaimals were either recognized chieftains, Major areas of Vaikom, Niranampetti, Irinjalakuda, Ranni, Koratti, Niranampetti, Angi and Koddachery were under control of Kaimal naduvazhis. Old name of Eranamkulam was Anjukaimal nadu(Raja of Anjikaimalnadu). Kartha is a related caste.  Chiefs of Cochin  KP Padmanabha Menon in his History of Kerala, Vol 2 mentions the Anji Kaimals whose Chief was the Cheranellur Kartha as owning all of Eranakulam. In fact, Eranakulam is known as Anji Kaimal in the early maps of Kerala. See Dutch in Malabar (Dutch Records No 13), 1910 shows a map from Common Era1740 that shows the area of AnjiKaimal as almost twice as large as the Cochin State. The other chiefs he mentions quoting Gollennesse (Dutch East India Company) is the 1) Moorianatt Nambiar 2) Paliath Achan (mentioned above), 3)Codacherry (Kotasseri) Kaimal, 4) Caimalieone (female Kaimal) of Corretty, 5) Changera Codda Kaimal, and 6) Panamoocattu Kaimal (Panambakadu Kaimal). The last four Kaimals are known as the Kaimals of Nandietter Naddu. The Kaimals of Nandietter Naddu had Nayar troops of 43,000 according to Heer Van Reede of the Dutch East India Company from 1694.Page 241 and 242The Kaimal royal members had moved to Goa during the Portuguese era. End of power P. K. S. Raja gives the following factors for the end of feudalism in Travancore and Cochin: *His violation in his dealings with the Etavita Pillamar of the principal custom of Malabar that a Nair lord would not be punished *His dealing with Raja of Quillon (his own family) where instead of making a conquered chief a subordinate, the Raja was made a state prisoner *His invitation of Hyder Ali to aid him in suppressing the revolt of the \\"whole country North of Kayamkulam\\" who did not appreciate his policies and his treatment of the nobility *The treaty between Cochin and Travancore and an inserted clause in 1701 that Travancore would aid Cochin in putting down the nobles of Cochin *Leading nobles of Cochin were brought to Tripunithra and asked to take an Oath of allegiance to the Rajas of Cochin and Travancore.

It has been a monument historique (a national heritage site of France) since 1906. It is the seat of the Bishopric of Blois, established in 1697.  History  The cathedral is in the Late Gothic style. Before becoming a cathedral, the building was a collegiate church dedicated to Saint Solenne. Construction began in the 12th century. However, except for traces in the crypt and in the base of the bell-tower, nothing is left of the original structure. Construction on the current facade and bell-tower was begun in 1544. The nave was destroyed in a 1678 storm, and the reconstruction in Gothic style took place between 1680 and 1700 under the direction of the architect Arnoult-S√©raphin Poictevin (d. 1720). This project was begun at the instigation of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose wife was a native of Blois. To celebrate the church's elevation to cathedral status in 1697, Louis XIV presented the organ console in 1704. The new see thereupon took the dedication to Saint Louis. The Chapel of Notre-Dame was added in 1860, under the direction of Jules de La Morandi√®re. American bombardment during World War II destroyed most of the glass-work in the cathedral. On December 22, 2000, new stained-glass windows were dedicated, the work of the Dutch artist Jan Dibbets and the French master glass-worker Jean Mauret. This work was done as part of a general restoration project begun in 1985. The new windows cover thirty-three bays, upper and lower, and have a combined surface area of over 360m2.  West front  The current west front, dating from the middle of the 16th century, represents a compromise between the Late Gothic and early Neoclassical styles. Represented are such medieval elements as gargoyles, pinnacled buttresses, and a pointed gable. The Neoclassical elements include the triangular pediment and the medallions in the round found in the spandrels. The most notable feature is the bell-tower on the north fa√ßade, which dominates the skyline of the town. Although the foundations date to the 12th century, construction on the current tower began in 1544. The tower is in the Renaissance style, with Ionic and Corinthian columns. The uppermost story is topped with a dome and lantern-tower added in 1603. This dome appears to be a replica of the domes on top of the towers of Tours Cathedral. The tower holds seven bells tuned to C, D, E, F, G, C# and D#.  The Interior  The cathedral consists of a long nave with side aisles running along the north and south. Side chapels open onto the aisles. There is also a chancel with its ambulatory. There is no transept. = The Chancel = The chancel has a pentagonal apse from the 16th and 17th centuries. Surrounding the chancel is the ambulatory with its apsidal chapels dating from the 19th century. The upper windows retain their stained glass by the 19th century artist Lobin. The ambulatory, which was not added until the 1860s, displays twisted pillars in a pastiche of the Louis XII style, an example of the architectural imitation that was common during the Second Empire. = The Nave and Side Chapels = After the storm in 1678, only the fa√ßade, the apse, and the pillars in the chancel were retained. It was at this time that the sanctuary was first given a rib vault. The church has but one ancient chapel, dating from the 12th century, and situated to the left of the nave beneath the tower. The chapel has a period rib vault which rests on capitals in the form of acanthus leaves. Across from the old chapel, the first chapel on the right side of the nave contains a bas-relief in marble that depicts the baptism of Christ, which was recovered from the tomb of the mother of the King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine Stanislas Leszczynski, who died in Blois. The cathedral contains another white marble bas-relief, called Memory and Meditation, which is the work of Louis II Lerambert and dates to 1660. The Clicquot organ console was given by Louis XIV in 1704. = The Crypt = The Crypt of Saint Solenne is located beneath the chancel. Traces of a Carolingian church were discovered there in 1927. That structure is thought to have been built toward the end of the 10th century by the Counts of Blois to house the relics of Saint Solenne, Bishop of Chartres. In the 12th century, upon the building of the new church, the chancel of the Carolingian structure was converted into a crypt. Only parts of the nave and apse of the original church remain visible in the crypt. Traces of the semi-circular apse can be seen behind the altar. On the left side of the aisle is a vault containing the tombs of the Bishops of Blois. References Source * P√©rouse de Montclos, Jean-Marie, 1988. Le guide du Patrimoine: Centre, pp. 175‚Äì179.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of Bordeaux. In 1998, UNESCO designated the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France as a World Heritage site, including the three main churches of Bordeaux : the basilica of St. Severinus, the basilica of St Michael and the St. Andrew's cathedral. History  The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096. Of the original Romanesque edifice, only a wall in the nave remains. The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th-15th centuries. The building is a national monument of France. Two royal weddings were celebrated in this church. In 1137 the 13-year-old Eleanor of Aquitaine married the future Louis VII, a few months before she became Queen. And in 1615, the Infanta of Spain Anne of Austria married the king of France and Navarre Louis XIII.  Description  A separate bell tower, the Tour Pey-Berland, stands next to the cathedral. The site is served by line A and line B of the tramway de Bordeaux at Station H√¥tel de Ville.  Architectural Style  Bordeaux Cathedral is built in the Gothic Style, it has an eastern facing choir with large stain glass windows for letting in morning light, it also has flying buttresses and ribbed vaults that were both decorative and for providing structural support which allowed structural weight to be better distributed going outward instead of downward allowing for thinner, taller, and stronger walls and for more windows letting in more light which was of religious significance at the time of building. The doors of Bordeaux Cathedral have decorated tympanum with depictions of didactic religious scenes and gargoyles and other decorative sculpture throughout as well as tall, thin spires typical of gothic style.  Marcad√© collection  The cathedral is home to the Marcad√© collection, which consists of a group of forty-two illuminations, among other objects (paintings, sculptures, liturgical vestments and silver objects). It was given to Bordeaux Cathedral by Canon Marcad√© in 1947. Of note, these illuminations, little studied so far, will be exhibited starting in 2015 in the cathedral, in a room specially designed for this collection.

It is located south-west of Ma≈æeikiai on the Varduva River. There are two churches in the town.  History  According to Kazimieras B≈´ga, the name of Seda is of hydronymic origin and was derived from the name of nearby Lake Seda also known as Sedula. Seda was first mentioned in written sources in the 13th century. From the 15th century Seda was famous as a busy trade settlement with Livonia. The town of Seda was established in 1500 and in 1508 the parish was founded. In the middle of 17th century, Seda suffered great losses during the Second Northern War, but recovered in the 18th century. In 1770, ciwun Vaclovas Barto≈°keviƒçius and his wife El≈æbieta Ju≈°kaitƒóthe sponsored construction of the Catholic Church of the Assumption. The town belonged to the Sapieha family, but their possessions were confiscated by the authorities of the Russian Empire for their participation the Uprising of 1831. Town residents also were active in Uprising of 1863 and book smuggling during the Lithuanian press ban. Poet and bishop Antanas Baranauskas worked in the town in 1855. The central town square is named in his honor and the monument was erected in 2000. In 1886, the western part of the town burnt down. During World War II, from June to July 1941, from 10 to 150 Jews of the village were murdered in mass executions perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppen of local Lithuanians.http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page/1/item/81/ A stele is erected on the site of the massacre. On October 6‚Äì7, 1944, a battle took place between the Lithuanian Homeland Defense Detachment (Tevynƒós apsaugos rinktinƒó) and the Russian Red Army. Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the battle, a monument was erected to the fallen soldiers in the square near the Church of the Assumption. In 1950 Seda was granted city rights. On July 16, 2004, the coat of arms of Seda town was approved by the presidential decree. Seda belonged to ≈Ωemaiƒçiai military district of Lithuanian partisans.  Religion Seda, like almost all Lithuania, is a Catholic village. There are two wooden churches in Seda. One of them is the Church of the Assumption which was first built in 1508. The Baroque church has several objects included in the Lithuanian heritage list ‚Äì two bells, four ornamented crosses, fourteen stations of the cross, five altars, double-sided paintings Christ between instruments of torture and Piet√†, three other paintings. The second church is the church of Saint John of Nepomuk which was consecrated in 1793. Before the Holocaust, the town also had a Jewish synagogue, first mentioned in 1657.

Duodji tools, clothing and accessories are functional and useful, and may also incorporate artistic elements. Sami duodji artists are able to bring function and art together in a delicate way so as to create beautiful works of art in their own right. These functional items include knives, cases, ladies' bags, wooden cups, certain articles of clothing, etc. Duodji items were made and meant to be used in an everyday work environment. Drinking cup (guksi) also used for Bushcraft A small S√°mi knife (decorative picture not traditional) Materials used Traditionally Sami handicraft was divided into two sub- groups, men's and women's handicraft. Men used mostly wood and antlers as well as other bones from reindeer when crafting, while women used leather and roots. The traditional Sami colours are red, green, blue and yellow. Well known artists Duodji artists are still active in Sapmi and still carry on the traditions of the Duodji. Although there have been slight changes in the traditional Duodji, today they are considered valuable pieces of art by collectors from all over the world. Some of the Duodji artists today are Olov Svonni, Martin Kuorak, Anders Sunna, Lars Pirak and Per Olof Utsi.

She has written a book about her ordeal, 3,096 Days (2010), upon which the 2013 German film 3096 Days is based.  Early life  Kampusch was raised by her mother, Brigitta Sirny (n√©e Kampusch), and her father, Ludwig Koch, in Vienna, Austria. Her early life with her mother was reportedly not a happy one, according to Ludwig Adamovich, head of a special commission looking into possible police failures in the investigation of the kidnapping. He claimed that \\"the time Kampusch was imprisoned might have been better for her than what she experienced before\\", a statement absolutely denied by Brigitta Sirny, who threatened to sue the commission chief over his remarks. Her family included two adult sisters, and five nieces and nephews. Sirny and Koch separated while Kampusch was still a child and divorced after her abduction. Kampusch spent time with both of them, and had returned to her mother's home from a holiday with Koch the day before her kidnapping.  Kidnapping  The 10-year-old Kampusch left her family's residence in Vienna's Donaustadt district on the morning of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged into a white minibus by two men, although Kampusch did not report a second man being present. A massive police effort followed in which 776 minivans were examined,So lie√ü die Polizei Nataschas Entf√ºhrer laufen T-Online extract from Sirny's book, German¬´Wer fotografiert seine Tochter nackt mit einer Peitsche?¬ª 20min.ch Interview with the primary Police investigator Max Edelbacher, German including that of kidnapper P≈ôiklopil, who lived about half an hour from Vienna by car in the Lower Austrian town of Strasshof an der Nordbahn near G√§nserndorf. He stated that he was alone at home on the morning of the kidnapping, and the police were satisfied with his explanation that he was using the minibus to transport rubble from the construction of his home. Speculations arose of child pornography rings or organ theft, leading officials to also investigate possible links to the crimes of French serial killer Michel Fourniret. Kampusch had carried her passport with her when she left, as she had been on a family trip to Hungary a few days before, so the police extended the search abroad. Accusations against Kampusch's family complicated the issue even more. = Captivity = During the eight years of her captivity, Kampusch was held in a small cellar underneath P≈ôiklopil's garage. The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar had only of space. It had a door made of concrete and was reinforced with steel. The room had no windows and was soundproof. For the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years of her captivity, she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, as well as while P≈ôiklopil was at work. In later years, she was seen outside in the garden alone, and P≈ôiklopil's business partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when P≈ôiklopil and she called at his home to borrow a trailer. After her 18th birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with P≈ôiklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise. He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours. She initially denied that they had made the trip, but eventually admitted that it was true, although she said that she had no chance to escape during that time. According to Kampusch's official statement after her escape, P≈ôiklopil and she would get up early each morning to have breakfast together. P≈ôiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. She did not feel that she had missed anything during her imprisonment, but she noted, \\"I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company\\", but she also said, \\"It was a place to despair.\\"Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2006. \\"It was a place to despair: kidnap girl\\". Accessed 7 September 2006. She was given a television and radio to pass the time, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so that she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car. A large portion of Kampusch's time upstairs was spent doing housework for P≈ôiklopil and cooking for him. Dietmar Ecker, Kampusch's media advisor, said that P≈ôiklopil \\"would beat her so badly that she could hardly walk.\\" P≈ôiklopil would starve her to make her physically weak and unable to escape. Her body mass index had reached as low as 14.8 during captivity (normal BMI: 18.5 to 25). Kampusch was also raped by P≈ôiklopil.https://www.thelocal.at/20191018/suspected-dutch-kidnap-brings-back- bad-memories-in-austria/ P≈ôiklopil had warned Kampusch that the doors and windows of the house were booby-trapped with high explosives. He also claimed to be carrying a gun and that he would kill her and the neighbours if she attempted to escape. Nevertheless, Kampusch on one occasion fantasized about chopping his head off with an axe, although she quickly dismissed the idea. She also attempted to make noise during her early years of captivity by throwing bottles of water against the walls. She said that on trips out with P≈ôiklopil, she had attempted to attract attention, but in vain. = Escape = The 18-year-old Kampusch reappeared on 23 August 2006. At 12:53 pm, she was cleaning and vacuuming her kidnapper's automobile in the garden when P≈ôiklopil got a call on his mobile phone. Because of the vacuum's loud noise, he walked away to take the call. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by P≈ôiklopil, who completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200 m through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on the window of a 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, \\"I am Natascha Kampusch\\". The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04 pm. Later, Kampusch was taken to the police station in the town of Deutsch-Wagram. Kampusch was identified by a scar on her body, by her passport (which was found in the room where she had been held), and by DNA tests. She was in good physical health, although she looked pale and shaken and weighed only ; she weighed when she disappeared eight years earlier. She grew only during her captivity. Sabine Freudenberger was the first police officer to speak to Kampusch after her ordeal, and she said that she was astonished by her \\"intelligence, her vocabulary\\". After two years, P≈ôiklopil had brought her books, newspapers, and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to √ñ1, an ORF station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: \\"a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills. I have learned to knit, for example.\\"Transcript: Natascha Kampusch TV interview: Times Online. 6 September 2006. Retrieved 15 September 2006. Kidnapper Wolfgang P≈ôiklopil (; 14 May 1962 ‚Äì 23 August 2006) was an Austrian communications technician of Czech origin. He was born to Karl and Waltraud P≈ôiklopil in Vienna, and was an only child. His father was a cognac salesman and his mother was a shoe saleswoman. P≈ôiklopil worked for a time at Siemens as a communications technician. Evidence recovery was complicated, as P≈ôiklopil's only computer was a 1980s Commodore 64, which is incompatible with modern-day data-recovery programs. Before Kampusch escaped, P≈ôiklopil was trying to procure false papers as a Czech citizen to \\"begin a new life\\" with Kampusch.Crooked nose drove Kampusch kidnapper claims his best friend, The Independent P≈ôiklopil knew that the police were after him, so he killed himself by jumping in front of a train near the Wien Nord station in Vienna. He had apparently planned to commit suicide rather than be caught, having told Kampusch, \\"they would not catch him alive\\".  After the escape  In her official statement Kampusch said, \\"I don't want and will not answer any questions about personal or intimate details\\". After Kampusch's escape, police investigated whether P≈ôiklopil had an accomplice,* ORF, 25 August 2006. \\"Hatte Entf√ºhrer einen Komplizen?\\". Accessed 25 August 2006 but they eventually determined that he acted alone. Kampusch sympathised with her captor in the documentary Natascha Kampusch: 3096 days in captivity. She said, \\"I feel more and more sorry for him‚Äîhe's a poor soul\\". According to police, she \\"cried inconsolably\\" when she was told that he was dead, and she lit a candle for him at the morgue. She has, however, referred to her captor as a \\"criminal\\". Newspapers quoting unnamed psychologists suggested that Kampusch might suffer from Stockholm syndrome, but Kampusch says that this is not the case. She suggests that people who use this term about her are disrespectful of her and do not allow her the right to describe and analyse the complex relationship that she had with her kidnapper in her own words. = Interviews = After reportedly \\"hundreds of requests for an interview\\" with the teenager, \\"with media outlets offering vast sums of money\\", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster ORF. The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval. ORF did not pay for its interview, and said any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels would be forwarded to Kampusch. The interview was sold to more than 120 countries at a fee of 290 euros per minute. This money, estimated to some hundred thousand euros, was to be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch. Likewise she was planning projects to help these women.Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung: Natascha Kampusch - the interview, 7 September 2006 Interest was enormous. The newspaper Kronen Zeitung and news magazine NEWS also interviewed Kampusch. The interview was published on 6 September 2006. Both press interviews were given in return for a package including housing support, a long-term job offer, and help with her education. New developments in Kampusch's case challenged the Austrian government in February 2008. Politicians of the conservative Austrian People's Party (√ñVP) threatened to break up the newly formed SP√ñ‚Äì√ñVP (\\"red‚Äìblack\\") coalition government in April and May 2008. Kampusch said that she had lost confidence in Austrian justice. Revelations of mistakes in the interior ministry's investigation of her kidnapping came to light, as well as statements of a policeman that were repeatedly ignored in 1998. On 16 June 2008, the newspaper The Times published an in-depth interview with Kampusch by Bojan Pancevski and Stefanie Marsh. On 17 February 2010, the British TV channel Five broadcast an hour-long documentary about the case, including an exclusive interview with Kampusch: Natascha: the Girl in the Cellar. = Books = The book Girl in the Cellar: the Natascha Kampusch Story by Allan Hall and Michael Leidig appeared in November 2006, written in English. Kampusch's lawyer described the book as being both speculative and premature, and therefore planned to take legal action against it.Skandal-Buch √ºber entf√ºhrte Natascha erz√ºrnt Familie , Der Spiegel, 30. November 2006. Together with two journalists, Kampusch's mother Brigitta Sirny wrote a book about the ordeal, Verzweifelte Jahre (\\"Desperate Years\\"). Kampusch appeared at the initial presentation of the book in August 2007, but did not want to be photographed or interviewed. Sirny writes that she did not have much contact with Kampusch after the escape because Kampusch was shielded from the outside world.\\"Nat√ºrlich verdiene ich daran\\" Spiegel Online, 10 August 2007. Kampusch wrote a book about her ordeal, 3096 Tage (3,096 Days), published in September 2010. It was adapted into a German movie, 3096, in 2013. On 12 August 2016, Natascha Kampusch released her second book titled 10 Years of Freedom. = Media endeavors = Kampusch established her own website containing personal information including pictures of herself on 5 December 2007. She had her own talk show on the new Austria TV channel, PULS 4, starting on 1 June 2008. The show had the working title of In Conversation with‚Ä¶Natascha Kampusch and eventually premiered as Natascha Kampusch trifft (Natascha Kampusch meets...).Kidnapped Austrian girl to host own show Digital Spy, 13 December 2007 It ran for only three shows. On 17 June 2010, German film-maker and director Bernd Eichinger announced that he was making a film based on Kampusch's captivity and wanted Kate Winslet to star in the film. Bernd Eichinger died on 24 January 2011; Kampusch attended his funeral. In 2011, the Austrian film Michael, which has a plot that resembles the Natascha Kampusch case, was released. On 15 April 2012, a German newspaper reported that a film based on her autobiography with the same name was to be made, featuring Antonia Campbell-Hughes as Kampusch and Thure Lindhardt as P≈ôiklopil. The film 3096 Days (3096 Tage) was directed by Sherry Hormann and was released on 28 February 2013. = House = Wolfgang P≈ôiklopil's house in Strasshof The house where Kampusch was imprisoned was built by P≈ôiklopil's grandfather, Oskar P≈ôiklopil, after World War II. During the Cold War period, Oskar and his son Karl built a bomb shelter, thought to be the origin of Kampusch's dungeon. P≈ôiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death. Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, \\"I know it's grotesque ‚Äì I must now pay for electricity, water, and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in\\". It was reported that she claimed the house from P≈ôiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape. When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself. In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.

View of the cathedral Cahors Cathedral (French: Cath√©drale Saint-√âtienne de Cahors) is a Roman Catholic church located in the town of Cahors, Occitanie, France. A national monument, it is an example of the transition between the late Romanesque and Gothic architectural traditions. Overview The church was built by bishop Gerard de CardaillacHugo fortified the rock of Cardaillac in Quercy (d√©partement of the Lot) in the mid-eleventh century, and the family remained prominent in the Hundred Years War; the Cardaillac produced two bishops of Montauban, Guillaume de Cardaillac (1317‚Äì1355) and Bertrand de Cardaillac (1359‚Äì1361). in the 11th century, over a church erected in the 7th century by St. Didier of Cahors. It was consecrated by Pope Calixtus II on September 10, 1119, and completed around 1135. The church, located in the city's centre, has the sturdy appearance of a fortified edifice: at the time, the local bishops were in fact also powerful feudal lords in their role as counts and barons of Cahors. The fa√ßade was renovated in 1316‚Äì1324 by Guillaume de Labroue, cousin of Pope John XXII, confirms this impression: it resembles a heavy castle wall, consisting in a porch surmounted by a bell tower enclosed between two towers. The six windows, as well as those on the porch sides, are rather narrow; the only elements characterizing it as a church are the magnificent portal with triple splays, surmounted by a gallery of small arches, and the large rose window. Plan of the Cathedral. On the northern side is a secondary fa√ßade in Romanesque style, also fortified. Nave The well-illuminated nave is 44 x 20 m wide. The two massive, 32 m-high, domes in Byzantines style, resting on pendentives, are supported by six huge pilasters. Unusually, there is no transept. Stained glass windows One of the domes is decorated with 14th- century frescoes, depicting the stoning of St. Stephen as well as eight prophets, each riding an animal, in the fashion of Greek or Hindu deities. The walls have numerous other medieval paintings. Apse In Gothic style on a Romanesque base (to which belong the columns with decorated capitals), the apse has three chapels with sculptures. The complex forms a pleasant contrast between the white apse and the colorful stained glass and the paintings of the choir. There are several tombs, such as that of Alain de Solminihac, and the precious relic of the Holy Cap, which supposedly was worn by Christ and which was brought to France by bishop Gerard de Cardillac after his trip to the Holy Land in 1113. Cloister. Cloister A door on the right of the choir gives access to the Flamboyant Gothic-style cloister, built in 1504 by bishop Anthony of Luzech. It has scenes of everyday life and a Madonna. On the western side is the St. Gaubert Chapel, with the vault decorated with Italian Renaissance paintings and, on the walls, 15th-century frescoes representing the Last Judgement. It is now home to a museum of Religious Art.

The cathedral is a national monument, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Cambrai. It was built between 1696 and 1703, on the site of a former 11th century building, as the church of the Abbey of St-Sulpice. During the French Revolution the old cathedral of Cambrai was destroyed, but the abbey church survived because it was used as a Temple of Reason. When the ecclesiastical status of Cambrai was restored in 1802, albeit as a diocese rather than as an archdiocese, which it had previously been, the bishop's seat was established in the surviving abbey church, which became the cathedral of Cambrai. Cambrai was again constituted an archbishopric in 1841. The cathedral was severely damaged by fire in 1859, but at length restored, with advice from Viollet-le- Duc, and consecrated on 12 May 1894. The cathedral was also badly damaged in World War I and, not so seriously, in World War II. It contains the tomb, by David d'Anger, of Fran√ßois F√©nelon, who was archbishop from 1696 to 1715. The Cathedral is a minor pilgrimage site because of the noted Italo-Byzantine painting called \\"Our Lady of Cambrai\\" or the Cambrai Madonna (c. 1340) in a side chapel. The cathedral now takes its dedication name from this: \\"Notre- Dame de Gr√¢ce\\" or \\"Virgin of Tenderness\\", from the Eleusa icon type it exemplifies.

History  :TO ELABORATE The Roman Catholic Bishop of the crusader diocese of Bethlehem, in the Holy Land, was favored by William IV, the Count of Nevers who died in Bethlehem as crusader, and inherited from him land near Clamecy (notably the hamlet Pantehenor), where a hospice (Maison-Dieu, a clergy-run hospital) had been established. In 1223, after the 1187 fall of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in Palestine to Ayyubid Sultan Saladin, the Bishop Rainiero (a Cistercian) took residence in Clamecy. Although the see was never granted membership in the French States- General (arguably being an 'overseas' see), the cathedral was the formal seat of the Diocese of Bethlehem in partibus infidelium (or Bethl√©em √†/les Clamecy) from 1223. Several of its bishops didn't actually reside in their tiny Burgundian bishopric (just Panthenor, the hospice and the chapel plus some revenues), taking up clerical offices elsewhere, as Auxiliary bishop or vicar general in larger (French) (arch)dioceses. The Dominican Guillaume (instated 1331) probably was the last incumbent of Bethlehem to set foot in his 'original' Palestinian diocese, where he hoped to restore the basilica (raising significant funds) and may have died (1346?47). During the long- standing Papal schism (from 1378), Clamecy had two rivaling series of Bishops from 1379 to 1422 : those loyal to Rome, hence canonical, but in Italian (double) exile, where they could only collect revenues from the see's Italian possessions, and schismatical pretenders, who however took actual possession in (after all French) Burgundy in the name of Antipopes at Avignon (Clement VII and Benedict XIII) or Pisa (Alexander V and John XXIII). In 1413, King Charles VI of France agreed the see should have the same privileges as all residential French bishoprics, but his clergy kept arguing Clamecy was 'only' a titular see in partibus infidelium, even after the regular legal and canonical nomination by the crown and the Holy see was clearly covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges from 1438 and by the Concordat of Bologna (1516), after which the king delegated his nomination for Clamecy to the Duchy of Nevers. Especially the Diocese of Auxerre and other neighbor sees kept contesting Clamecy's spiritual and canonical jurisdiction, and of course its benefices, seeking recourse in lawsuits, notably with the (regional) parliament (feudal appellate court) on 22 February 1674 and the general assembly of the French clergy on 27 August 1770. In the second half of the 16th century, they see remained vacant as the nominees of the Dukes of Nevers (by royal delegation) were refused papal confirmation. The Bishopric of Bethlehem(-Ascalon) in the Holy Land was nominally restored (a first time) in 1462(?), existing as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric alongside the residential Clamecy until its suppression in 1603(?). In 1790, the Diocese of Bethl√©em √† Clamecy was abolished as a residential see during the French Revolution (later affirmed by the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801), its territory being merged on 29 November into the Diocese of Autun. Presently it is part of the Archdiocese of Sens. The Bishopric of Bethlehem(-Ascalon) in the Holy Land was nominally restored again on 3 July 1840 by Pope Gregory XVI as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric and this time give the Apostolic succession of the Burgundian Bethlehem; its title was however vested in the Territorial Abbots Ordinaries of the Territorial Abbacy of Saint-Maurice d‚ÄôAgaune (the sole abbey of the Swiss Congregation of Canons Regular of St. Maurice's Abbey in Switzerland) held the title of Bishop of Bethlehem in personal union from 1840.07.03 until 1970; it has been vacant since 1987.

In 1817 the former dioceses of Dax and of Aire were again separated from that of Bayonne and joined to form the new Diocese of Aire and Dax, of which the bishop's seat was at Aire Cathedral. In 1833 the bishop's seat was officially transferred to Dax and to Dax Cathedral. Aire Cathedral remains as a co-cathedral. Dax Cathedral is a national monument of France. Ancienne Cath√©drale Sainte-Marie (√©glise Notre-Dame)  History  In the late 13th century, when the town of Dax was at the height of its prosperity, the bishops had a number of ecclesiastical buildings constructed, among which was a new cathedral on the site of an ancient Romanesque sanctuary which had become too cramped. This Gothic structure collapsed in 1646; all that remains of it is the magnificent Portal of the Apostles in the north transept: 12 metres high and 8 metres wide, this doorway contains a quantity of beautiful sculptures, fairly rare in the south of France, despite some mutilations and damage incurred during the passage of time.  Building  Apart from the portal, which was classed as a national monument of France in its own right in 1884, the present cathedral was built from 1694 onwards in a plain style of classical inspiration. The main fa√ßade and south elevation have a massive, almost austere, appearance. The north elevation however, which looks onto a small square in the historical centre of the town, does not lack charm, despite a certain rigidity. The dome over the crossing is decorated with murals. The quire houses the old stalls (16th century) of the canons, saved from the former cathedral. The mid-18th century high altar and the altar of the Virgin Mary are of polychromatic marble and are the work of the Mazzetti brothers, originally from Switzerland but resident in Avignon. The organ loft, of the late 17th century, was the work of Caular, a local ebonist. After its recent restoration this organ loft is considered one of the most beautiful in France. The building also contains a number of paintings, among them \\"Jesus and His Disciples\\" by Gerrit van Honthorst (17th century), and the \\"Adoration of the Shepherds\\" by Hans von Aachen (late 16th century).

Apse of Lisieux Cathedral, from the close The present cathedral was built between 1170 and the middle of the 13th century through the initiative of Bishop Arnulf. It was the seat of the Bishop of Lisieux until the diocese of Lisieux was abolished under the Concordat of 1801 and merged into the Diocese of Bayeux. The edifice is 110 meters and is a national monument. Liseux Cathedral interior The west front of the building consists of three portals surmounted by two towers. The south tower was built in the 16th century and at the top bears a 17th-century fl√®che. Buttresses were added to the south face in the 15th century. The cathedral survived World War II wholly intact though the town suffered Allied bombing in 1944. From the outset, the architect designed quadripartite rib vaults and flying buttresses, making it one of Normandy‚Äôs first Gothic buildings. The nave is fairly austere and is inspired by the Gothic architectural style of the √éle de France, whereas the most recent parts of the building were constructed in the 18th century (the chevet, the lantern tower and the western fa√ßade) in Norman style. An earlier cathedral is presumed to have existed since the 6th century, as there was a Bishop of Lisieux from that time, but nothing is known of the earlier edifice. It is wrongly claimed that Henry Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and future king of England, married Eleanor of Aquitaine at the cathedral in 1152. In fact they married in Poitiers Cathedral. Having been involved in the trial of Joan of Arc, Pierre Cauchon was in fact named as Bishop of Lisieux in 1432 and is buried there.

Construction of the cathedral began between 1175 - 1180, when a structure in Romanesque style was started. Defects in the original design and construction had to be corrected in the 13th century, in which the architect Gautier de Vainfroy was much involved. He had to remove the previous cathedral almost totally and start a new structure in Gothic style. In the later 13th century work was often interrupted due to lack of funds, a problem removed by the generosity of Charles IV in the early 14th century. Further progress was interrupted by the Hundred Years' War and occupation by the English. The archives of the diocese were destroyed in 1793 ‚Äì 1794, thus deleting much knowledge about the early history of the church. The composer Pierre Moulu worked at the cathedral in the early 16th century. Because of its construction period, the design of the cathedral encompasses several periods of Gothic architecture. The cathedral rises to a height of 48 meters; inside, the vaults at the choir rise to 33 meters. The interior ornamentation is noted for its smoothness, and the space for its overall luminosity. The cathedral contains a famous organ, built in the 17th century.

Most cattle judging occurs in show rings at agricultural shows. Judgments on cattle are ultimately based on which animal is worth the most profit. There are many fine points to cattle judging. In a beef animal, for example, it is desirable to have a large animal with muscle development. In a dairy cow, however, the judge would look for characteristics that would help to produce the best possible milk. When judging cattle, there is an overjudge, who looks at all of the cattle and puts them in order of ‚Äòbest‚Äô animal to ‚Äòworst‚Äô animal. Judging Red Poll heifers  Origins  Assessment of cattle quality is a practice that has existed for many thousands of years. Although in modern times the judging of cattle usually occurs in a show ring, in both the past and present judging is also a guide to purchasing animals. When purchasing an animal, a buyer judges the animal/s just as a judge would in a show.  Judging cattle  Preparing stud beef cattle for agricultural show competitions. Every judge has their own system, though there is now a push for a standardized points system. Usually, this system starts at the head and goes all the way through to the tail, looking at finer points along the way. Sometimes at agricultural shows there are junior judging competitions. These competitions are created solely for the purpose of giving youth a chance to judge in a competition. The competitors then can go on to talk to the overjudge of the event about why they placed these cows in the order they did. When the competitors are judging, the overjudge is judging them, and the competitors get points on the systems they use in the ring. These systems are usually the system an overjudge uses when they are judging beef cattle. = Beef cattle criteria = When judging beef cattle, the judge looks for * A good head carriage- how the head is held on the cow. This also has a lot to do with the neck on the cow--the neck should be broad, sit evenly on the shoulders, and the base must be in line with the spine. * A long body is also desirable to the judge, as this means that the cow will hold much more meat than a cow with a shorter body. * The cow must also have strong, sturdy legs that show no signs of cow-hock, bow-leg, or sickle-hock. If the cow has any of these structural problems, there could be a risk of permanent injury. They must also be well muscled, and everything must be as large as possible, but all limbs must still remain in proportion to the size of the body. * As much muscle as possible in order to maximize the profit to the farmer. However, as a beef cow is much heavier than a dairy cow and puts much more weight on the hooves, it is very important that there are no signs of irregular wearing of hooves, as this may be a sign of structural problems in the leg. = The head = On cows, the judge usually cannot check their teeth without using a head bail, as cattle are sensitive around the mouth area. When checking their teeth, the teeth must sit evenly ‚Äì if the cow has overshot or undershot teeth (much like an overbite or an underbite) then this could cause problems for the cow later. These may include soreness in the mouth, and the cow will not be able to eat as well, and will therefore not be as muscled. Since the teeth in a cow can't be checked, the judge must look for other symptoms in the jaw. The judge usually goes through the following system: * They check that the muzzle is as broad as possible, but still in proportion. * They then stand a bit further back and look at the entire head. The judge is looking for proportion in the head and whether it 'matches' the rest of the body. When looking at the head of a cow, most judges believe that it is not necessary to look at the ears. Some breeds may have big ears, some may have small ears, but that will have no effect on the meat produced by the cow. When looking at the head, there are a few key things that the judges are looking for. One of the main things the judge looks for when judging any animal is the structure. In most animals, if one joint is set incorrectly, there is a good chance that others are also set incorrectly. The judges must check that the head is in proportion to the rest of the body. It should also be held naturally high- if the head is set naturally below the shoulders of the cow, there is a likely chance that there is something structurally incorrect there, and also there may be some other structure faults throughout the rest of the body. However, the head shouldn't be held too high- this can suggest some aggressive and bold nature in the cow. However, this will also have no effect on the quality of meat produced, and in most competitions it would not matter if a cow was more active than other cows, provided that it wasn't causing harm to other people and their livestock. If the cow is causing excessive damage, the judge will have to ask for that cow to leave the ring, and the cow would be promptly disqualified from the event. = Topline = The term 'topline' refers to the back of the cow being judged in the showring. On a cow, it should be straight, however, the cow is not a board, and should therefore have a slight bend in the back, as well as having a relaxed back. As a bull gets older, he develops a hump on his neck. This is a normal characteristic of bulls from all breeds, and it is only worrying to the judge if the hump, or crest, is not there. When the bull is young, the crest will not be as noticeable, but as he gets older, it will become a lot more obvious. With some breeds, such as the Brahman, the hump will be above the shoulder. Once again, breed characteristics are important aspects of judging, and the judge hired for the event will have a lot of knowledge on the breed characteristics of that breed he or she is judging, and usually the judges specialize in only a few breeds because of this reason. The shoulder blades on a cow should be neat- they should be the same on either side of the back, and they shouldn't stick out too much- on a beef cow, this area should have some muscle. The shoulder blades should also be set in line with the spine- if they are not, the cow could be structurally incorrect. As with the shoulder blades, all joints in the back should be level with the spine, from the shoulder blades to the hip and the pins of the cow. However, some cows' pins do sit slightly lower than the spine. This is acceptable, but it is undesirable for any of the joints to drop off from the spine too much. If joints are set too low from the spine, this will affect the angle of the spine, as well as the angle of the ribs and pelvis, and may cause the animal to walk with a slight waddle. This is not desirable in a beef cow. This can also cause problems with the legs, which means that the hooves do not wear evenly on the ground. This can cause permanent lameness and other conditions at some point in the animal's life. = The legs = When looking at the legs in an animal, the judge is looking mainly at the structure, and for some muscle. As mentioned before, when one joint is set incorrectly on an animal, there is a high chance that the other joints will be set incorrectly as well. When looking at the legs, the cow should be standing squarely on the hooves. This means that the cow will have to also stand squarely on the leg- therefore, the leg must have some bend in it. If the bend is too much, this is referred to as having too much angle in the leg. If the cow's leg is straight, this means that it is post-legged. The cow must have some bend in the hock, however, but not too much. If the cow has too much or too little bend in the legs, the bones in the shoulder blade will be set at either too sharp or too flat of an angle. The bones in the shoulder meet together in an L shape, tilted to the right. We want this angle to be about roughly 90 degrees. The legs on a cow should be long and well muscled. In is inadvisable to have short, but heavily muscled cattle, as it is preferable for the cow to be larger, have a lot of muscle, but also have some fat. The fat, however, must be minimal- the cow should have some fat, but not a lot. Looking at the legs of cattle, just like on any other animal, it is one of the most important areas to look at. If the joints in the leg are not set correctly, then it as immediate area of concern. When looking at the legs of cattle, the first areas the judge will look at are the shoulder blades and the hocks, the joint in the middle of the leg. When looking at the shoulder blades, they must be in line with the spine, not above or below. However, it is common to see animals with their shoulders set slightly above the spine, however, this is still an area of concern, as this is not where the shoulder is supposed to be set. When looking at the hocks, they should have a bit of bend in them, however not too much or too little. If the angle is too straight, we call that post-legged. If the angle is too bent, we call that sickle-hocked. Both of these conditions are very serious, as they will affect the angle the hoof strikes the ground. This means that there will be irregular wearing of the hooves, and can lead to permanent lameness. A lot of the potential in beef cattle lies in structure, and how the muscle is set along the body. = Main body and ribs = When looking at the body, the judge wants to see as much rib extension as possible- this means having a large middle area, adding more muscle to the animal. The amount of muscle must be consistent throughout the animal, all the way from neck to the rump. The body should also be as long as possible, but everything must remain in proportion to the rest of the body. The spine should be as heavily muscled as possible, as this is where most steaks come from. However, there MUST remain a consistent amount of muscling on the body- it is not desirable to have an animal who is heavily muscled in the front shoulders, but not much muscle on the back. Also, when looking under the body, although there should be a dip in the middle, the dip should definitely not be right at the front- this can also suggest having too much muscle. In general, the most muscle is at the back of the animal, however, we must keep in mind when judging that there is consistency. = Rump = When standing behind an animal, there are a few things the judge looks for. * When standing directly behind as her, they should see only the rump, and none of the body. This means that there is a good amount of muscle on the rump. * If there is a wide rump, the feet should be set apart wider, as well. * Like above, if the rump is smaller, the feet should be set closer together- if they are not, the cow could have an incorrect structure. The judge will step backwards again and have another look at the legs from behind. The legs should look straight going all the way down. * If the legs are bent inwards, this is called cow-hocked. This means that the hocks are pointing inwards, towards each other. * If the legs are bent outwards, this is called bow-leg. This is a condition that can affect almost any animal. In general, a lot of muscle should be on the rump. * The widest part of the rump should be the stifle- about halfway down. The rump should also be round, and not bony. When standing behind the cow, the rump should obscure any of the body except for the back of the head, as this means there is a lot more meat on the animal. = Hooves and pasterns = After looking at leg structure the judge then wants to look at the hooves and pasterns. The pasterns are the bones that run from the top of the hoof to the fetlock. As the leg structure affects much of the hoof structure, the hooves are very vulnerable. If the animal does not step on them correctly, lameness, even permanent lameness, may occur in the animal's life. Although in the judging ring it will be hard to see the cow's feet, there are a few things the judge must know, and look out for along the way. * There are two claws on a cow's feet. * These \\"dew claws\\" need to be of equal length, and shouldn't curve around too much. * However, there should be a slope from the pastern joint down the hoof to the ground. * The heel of the hoof needs to be sitting above the ground, but not too far above the ground- we do need some bend in the pastern. * The skin that is attached to the hoof needs to be above the ground as well. * When the pastern is too straight, it may appear as if the cow is walking on tip-toes, but this is a problem, as it means that the hoof is not striking the ground properly. *Hooves need to be of equal size and correct shape. Hooves shouldn't curl in, under, or be to small. This is the foundation of the animal. = Walking = In a judging ring, the animals will be walking. When the animal is walking freely, the back hooves should step into the front hooves' footprints. * If an animal is sickle-hocked, there will be some overstepping, which means he is stepping over his footprints. * When the animal is post-legged, understepping will occur. Understepping means the cow is not reaching his footprints. * If the judge sees any overstepping or understepping, they would then take another look at the leg structure of that particular cow. * If he or she sees uneven footprints in the ground, this may also suggest some structure problems in the animal, and they would therefore have another look at the leg structure of the cow. = Fat and muscle = When animals are around the same size, in general, the bones will be the same size. However, there could be two cows of the same size, and their weights will be completely different, as one would have more muscle and/or fat than the other. On a beef animal, we want as much muscle as possible. However, we do want some fat on the animal- just not too much. We call the last layer of fat that has formed on an animal 'finish' animals can be over finished (too fat) or under finished (not fat enough). * In general, anything below the point of the elbow is fat. * The brisket (the flap on a cow's neck) is only fat and skin. We generally want to see fullness to the brisket, this means that the animal has enough finish and muscle development. If there is too much finish, it will look 'messy,' aka, skin will fold over and look a lot like double chins on people. The skin should be tight and the brisket full. * The flank of an animal is generally only a flap of skin, just under where the joints of the leg and hip are. You want to see a large full flap of skin, when an animal is narrowly muscled and under finished, the flank will be tighter to the body, this is not desired. An animal with less capacity will also have a smaller flank. * Once looking at the brisket and flank of the cow, the judge looks at the tailhead. The tail head is the last place an animal fills in with 'finish' if it isn't full at all, then the animal has not finished yet and needs more days on feed then other animals in the class, if it is fat, then folds of skin will again appear, and the animal is over finished. Just because is not large, and the animal is leaner, and that does not mean there can be more muscle on that animal. Muscle can be hidden under fat, and if it is, that animal is more desirable. * The ribs, point of the shoulder and the spine are very important when looking at muscle as well as fat. When looking at the back of an animal from behind, the ribs should 'spring out' from the spine. This should give a tabling effect, you want an animal to be wide across the back, with the spine dimpling down the center. The point of shoulder should look very muscular, if it appears like the animal is flexing, it is a very lean desirable animal. The judge must keep in mind that all breeds are different on where fat is deposited. Before people judge cattle, they should know a lot about the breed to be judged, and where the fat is usually deposited in that breed. * Also, the judge must keep in mind that the rump of an animal is where the most muscle will be, and less fat. There are also a number of places on the animal that a lot of muscle should be. * On either side of the spine- this is where a lot of steaks come from. * Between the knee and the elbow of an animal- the forearm. * The stifle, it is a muscle seen from behind an animal on both sides of the rump. An animal's widest point should be its stifle, if it is not, the animal is light muscled. It will also be very obvious looking at some cows where a lot of muscle is, because of the high muscle definition. When looking at bulls, there are a few things that differ from normal cattle judging that the judge will be looking out for. * There will be a crest above the neck- the judge mustn‚Äôt get this confused with the shoulder. On big bulls, the crest may even be higher than the head, creating the illusion that the head is set too far down on the bull. This may not be true. * If the head really does look like it is set too low on the bull, the judge will ignore the crest and look at all of the structure on the animal, especially on the front half, just to make sure the head is set correctly. * The greater size of the testicles, the more cows the bull can service. * The sheath on a bull should be firmly attached and not pendulous. If the sheath is pendulous, the bull is of more risk to grass seed problems or injury. = Cows = As there are differences when judging bulls, there are also differences when judging cows that are very important. * The udders on females should not be pendulous. * Teat size and placement is critical, but keep in mind that everything should still remain in proportion. * Coarse hair indicates low fertility. * The navel should not be pendulous. * If the navel does appear pendulous, there is a chance that her brothers or sons may have the same problem.

The album was first released by United Artists Records in 1965 in both monaural and stereo editions, with a CD release in 1988. The music was composed and conducted by John Barry, and performed by the John Barry Orchestra. This was Barry's third soundtrack for the series. The soundtrack was still being recorded when it came time for the album to be released, so the LP only featured twelve tracks from earlier in the film; an expanded edition with six bonus tracks was released for the first time when the album was reissued on Compact Disc on 25 February 2003 as part of the \\"James Bond Remastered\\" collection. Additionally, the music in the film was unfinished days before the film's release in theatres due to a late change by Eon Productions to use a title song with the same name as the film. Title theme change The original main title theme to Thunderball was titled \\"Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\", which was written by John Barry and Leslie Bricusse. The title was taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as \\"Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\". Barry had thought he could not write a song about a vague \\"Thunderball\\" term or the film's story, so his song was a description of the character James Bond.Fiegel, Eddy. John Barry: A Sixties Theme. New York: Macmillan, 2001. The song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey. When there were concerns with the length of the track compared to the needed titles, it was later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick as Bassey was not available and featured a longer instrumental opening designed so the lyrics would not be heard until after the title \\"Thunderball\\" appeared in Maurice Binder's title design.Spencer, 2008, p. 63-64. Both versions were not released until the 1990s. The song was removed from the title credits after United Artists requested that the theme song contain the film's title in its lyrics.p. 51 Burlingame, Jon The Music of James Bond Oxford University Press, 01/10/2012 When it was planned to use the Warwick version in the end titles Shirley Bassey sued the producersp.336 Williams, John Miss Shirley Bassey Quercus, 01/11/2010p. 56 Burlingame with the result being that neither version was heard in the film and different instrumental versions of the theme appeared on the High Fidelity (Bassey's) and Stereo (Warwick's) soundtrack LPs.Kendall, Lukas Liner notes Thunderball CD Barry teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote \\"Thunderball\\" in a rush.Spencer, 2008, p. 64. Tom Jones, who sang the new theme song, allegedly fainted in the recording booth after singing the song's final, high note. Jones said of the final note, \\"I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning.\\" Country musician Johnny Cash also submitted a song to Eon productions titled \\"Thunderball\\" but it wasn't used.Bitter Cinema piece on Johnny Cash's Thunderball The lyrics of Cash's \\"Thunderball\\" describe the film's story.YouTube ‚ÄìThunderball Opening with Johnny Cash The producers' decision to change the film's theme song so close to the release date meant that only some of the film's soundtrack had been recorded for release on LP. Adding to the delay issues, Barry had written large amounts of the score around the original theme and woven it throughout the score (along with the recurring underwater \\"Search For Vulcan\\" motif). After \\"Thunderball\\" was written, Barry wrote, orchestrated, and recorded several new pieces interpolating it. Barry's scores always included a track which gave the film's theme song a full statement in the form of a sensitive, slowed-down instrumental ballad, often played over a romantic moment or a scene set in a nightclub or casino; he re-arranged \\"Thunderball\\" as a lush, subtly jazzy orchestral piece in the easy listening style that was popular at the time. Though \\"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" was dropped as the theme song, some of the pieces which included its melody remained part of the score, and it receives full statements twice: by full orchestra and jazz rhythm quartet with bass, drums, guitar, and vibraphone in the track \\"Caf√© Martinique\\" (immediately followed by the \\"Vulcan\\" cue), and as a wild, bongo-laden cha-cha-cha in \\"Death of Fiona.\\" The scene which includes the latter takes place at Club Kiss Kiss, and features the bongo drumming of bandleader King Errisson. Because Thunderball score had, essentially, two main themes to work from, as well as the \\"Search For Vulcan\\" cue, the \\"007 Theme\\" and the \\"James Bond Theme,\\" it is arguably the richest of the early Bond scores, thematically speaking.

Captain of the Manchester City youth team that won the 1986 FA Youth Cup, Redmond made his first-team debut at 18. He quickly established himself in the side, and was named the club's Player of the Year in 1988. The same year, he became the youngest ever Manchester City captain. Between 1987 and 1990 he played every single game in three straight seasons. Redmond transferred to Oldham Athletic in 1992, where he spent six years. He then played for Bury for five seasons, and also had a period as caretaker- manager in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. He left Bury in 2003, and spent a season in non-league football before retiring. Career Born in Liverpool, Redmond signed schoolboy forms with Manchester City in October 1982, choosing City ahead of his hometown club Liverpool. As a junior, he played for Blue Star, a Manchester City affiliated team based in Cheadle. His Blue Star teammates included Paul Lake, Andy Hinchcliffe and Ian Brightwell. He signed his first professional contract in November 1984. Redmond was part of a promising group of young players from the same intake, of whom he and Paul Moulden were the first to play for the first team. His debut came in February 1986, against Queen's Park Rangers. In total he made eight senior appearances that season,James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 64. including the final of the 1986 Full Members Cup. At the same time, Redmond was also captain of the youth team, who progressed to the final of the FA Youth Cup. In the final, City beat local rivals Manchester United over two legs, and as captain it was Redmond who lifted the trophy. In the 1986‚Äì87 season, Redmond made 32 first team appearances, mainly at centre-half, but also sometimes as a sweeper. He also played enough reserve matches to claim a Central League winner's medal. The first team fared less well, and were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the season. As the club season came to a close, Redmond received a call-up to the England under-19 team for a tour of South America. In the Second Division, Redmond was first-choice centre-half, and started every game.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 443. This included a 10‚Äì1 victory against Huddersfield Town that was the club's biggest win in the 20th Century, and a goalscoring tally that has not been equalled in English professional football since. At the end of the season he was voted the club's Player of the Year. Club captain Kenny Clements left Manchester City in the 1988 close season, and Redmond was appointed as his successor. At 20, he became the club's youngest ever captain. He again started every single match, as Manchester City gained promotion to the First Division. A third season as an ever-present followed in 1989‚Äì90. He continued to play regularly until March 1992, when he lost his place to Michel Vonk,James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 185. and was transfer-listed shortly thereafter. Redmond received his first call-up to the England under-21 team in 1988, and later captained the side. Redmond was the first player from Manchester City's 1986 Youth Cup winning squad to gain under-21 honours, though several others soon followed. In October 1988 five of them were called up at the same time: Redmond, Ian Brightwell, Andy Hinchcliffe, Paul Lake and David White. In total Redmond played for Manchester City 287 times and scored seven goals. In August 1992 he transferred to Oldham Athletic. Redmond and Neil Pointon went from City to Oldham in exchange for Rick Holden and ¬£300,000. Redmond was part of the Oldham team that reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1994, but Redmond missed the semi-final itself through suspension. He played 239 times for Oldham between 1992 and 1998, and scored four goals. In summer 1998 he joined former Oldham manager Neil Warnock at Bury, on a Bosman transfer. When Warnock left the club in December 1999, Redmond and Andy Preece became joint caretaker- managers. Preece was appointed manager on a permanent basis at the end of the season, and Redmond became player-assistant manager. After five years at Bury, Redmond ended his career with a spell in non-league football. He played a single game for Burscough, and then joined Leigh RMI of the Football Conference in August 2003, and spent a season at the club. At the time of an interview in June 2011, Redmond was working for a builder's merchant, Travis Perkins. Redmond has three children. His son, Daniel, is also a professional footballer, who plays in the Welsh Premier League, for TNS.http://www.tnsfc.co.uk/2018/05/24/first-new-signing-ahead-of-2018-2019-as- ruscoe-looks-to-the-future/ References External links * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Premier League players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Burscough F.C. players Category:Leigh Genesis F.C. players Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Bury F.C. non- playing staff Category:Footballers from Liverpool ","title":"Steve Redmond"},{"id":"6654515","text":"Poothole is situated in Thrissur city of Kerala state of India.

Sambanthan, was the fifth President of Malaysian Indian Congress and one of the Founding Fathers of Malaysia along with Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tan Cheng Lock. He was the MIC President from 1955 to 1973, when he was ousted by party members. Sambanthan was one of the leading Indian leaders who played a prominent role in the independence movement in Malaya. As president of the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond. He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance. The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal Alliance in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition's image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya. The finest hour was achieved on 31 August 1957 when Independence was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory. Background Sambanthan was born in Sungai Siput in 1919. His father, M.S. Veerasamy, came to Malaya in the 1896, was a pioneer rubber planter in Sungai Siput, Perak and owned several rubber plantations. His siblings are V. Meenachi Sundram, V. Krishnan and V. Saraswathy . Sambanthan received his early education at Clifford High School in Kuala Kangsar, Perak. A keen sportsman, Sambanthan was an intelligent student who loved to chat and joke. Political career =Early Involvement= Sambanthan, with the intention of creating a more cohesive and unified Indian community, organised the Perak United Indian Council in 1953, the same year he was elected Perak MIC chairman. However, the event that helped catapult Sambanthan to the forefront of MIC politics was a visit by Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the younger sister of the then Indian prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Sambanthan had befriended her when he was involved with the Indian National Congress while studying at Annamalai University. On his invitation, she visited Malaya in 1954 and despite the ongoing communist insurgency, visited Sungai Siput where she officially opened the Mahatma Gandhi Tamil School. The meeting between Sambanthan and Vijaya Lakshmi in 1954 helped push the former into the limelight and then on to the party president's position in 1955 In the same year, he was elected member of the legislative council for the Kinta Utara constituency. The constituency was renamed in 1959 as the Sungai Siput seat. =Becoming MIC President= In the post World War II period, the Indian professional elite was largely held together by the unifying ideology of Indian nationalism. In 1946, the Indian of other ethnicity in Malaya formed the MIC. For the first eight years, the MIC leaders were either North Indian or Malayalee, representing a minority among the Indians. The majority of Indians (90%) in Malaya at that time were South Indians, mainly from the labouring class. The Emergency (declared by the British in 1948 to battle communist insurgency) regulations and new trade union legislation also led to the leadership of the trade union movement passing from the Chinese, who were much better organised, to the Indians. This dilution of the MIC's objectives affected the status of Indian plantation workers in the Malaysian economy then and its repercussions are still being felt today. In 1954, there were serious debates within the MIC as to whether the partys should join the UMNO-MCA Alliance that was emerging as the leading political movement in the country, following their successes in local elections. The MIC had aligned itself with Datuk Onn Jaafar's Independence of Malaya Party and later Party Negara, and there was a rethink within the MIC leadership during this period. According to Rajeswary Ampalavanar, author of The Indian Minority and Political Change in Malaya 1954‚Äì1957, the MIC leadership was quite eager to join the Alliance but there was some resistance within the party's broader membership. They were willing to support the move if the party could secure some concessions from the Alliance on inter-communal issues, particularly on education. Then MIC president K.L. Devaser came under heavy criticism from the Tamil media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. While he was quite outspoken, his influence was largely among the urban-based Indian elite and he lacked wider grassroots support. Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party's grassroots. In March 1955, reports in the local daily Tamil Murasu urged Tamils to boycott the MIC. Sambanthan, then a state MIC leader, emerged during this period as an alternative candidate for the party leadership. Going by historical records, he was literally coerced into taking up the presidency. Another candidate, P.P. Narayanan, was approached by party leaders but turned down their invitation because he wanted to concentrate on union activities. Sambanthan initially declined but following some pressure from the Tamil leaders agreed to take on the party leadership. He was duly elected the fifth president of the MIC in May 1955. Sambanthan was also acceptable to the Malay leadership because he played down political (and to some extent, economic) rights in favour of cultural and language rights. =Becoming a Tamil party= The MIC's main challenge was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the poverty and needs of the labouring class, who in 1938 comprised 84% of the plantation labour force. Sambanthan started a recruitment campaign among plantation workers, relying on patronage of Hinduism in its popular South Indian form, increased use and fostering of the Tamil language, and Tamil cultural activities. But the MIC under Sambanthan failed to reconcile the needs of labour with the political aspirations of the middle class. The traditionalists and the lower middle class strengthened their hold within the party, while the upper class professionals and the intelligentsia moved away from it. Subsequently, two paths to leadership emerged among the Indians ‚Äì political and trade union ‚Äì with very little interaction between them. Under Sambanthan's leadership, the MIC effectively became a Tamil party. Sambanthan served as president of the MIC from 1955‚Äì71 and was largely responsible for the transformation of the party from an active, political organisation to a conservative, traditional one, emphasising Indian culture, religion and language. It was also the weakest of the three main political parties. It had the smallest electorate ‚Äì 7.4% in 1959; and it had little support from the Indian community at large. Since the Indian community was geographically dispersed and divided, it comprised less than 25% in any constituency. Therefore, the MIC's over-riding concern was to remain a partner in the Alliance (the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance that had won the first elections in 1955, and that was subsequently renamed Barisan Nasional) and obtain whatever concessions it could from the dominant UMNO. In the process, political and economic rights of workers were sacrificed. Sambanthan, while as MIC president, helped strengthen the party economically by selling about half of his father's 2.4 km¬≤ rubber estate to help the Indian community as well as to provide financial strength to the party coffers. Sambanthan took over the mantle of the MIC during a period of turmoil in the party in 1955, barely months before the first federal elections, and over time strengthen the party and consolidated its position in the coalition. He did not always please his members, but was able to gradually unite a party that had considerable internal splits. =First federal elections= The year 1955 was a milestone for Malaya's advance towards self-governance. The British colonial administration had agreed to hold the first federal elections in July 1955 and Sambanthan was instantly thrown into the cauldron of electoral politics. He met the new challenge and following negotiations with the Alliance leaders the MIC was allocated two seats ‚Äì in Batu Pahat, Johor, and Sungai Siput, Perak. Sambanthan Thevar contested the Sungai Siput seat and won comfortably. The Alliance swept 51 of the 52 seats, the exception being a seat in Perak. Following the election win, Sambanthan was appointed to the Cabinet and sworn in as Labour Minister in the Alliance government. The coalition decided to push for a quicker transfer of power and an Alliance delegation went to London in January 1956 to hold talks on a range of issues, including independence, with Secretary of State Alan Lennox-Boyd. =Merdeka negotiations= Earlier, in 1956, Sambanthan led the MIC delegation in the negotiations between the Alliance parties in drawing up a memorandum to be presented to the Reid Commission. Sambanthan was a pragmatic negotiator and worked hard to secure the interests of the Indian community, while at the same time being sensitive to the broader interests of the Alliance party's diverse membership. He was at times criticised by his party members for conceding on certain issues, but Sambanthan was faced with the need to find a suitable balance to the various sectoral demands and sought to take a middle path in the negotiations. For taking such as position, he was praised by the Tunku. The final constitutional negotiations in London in May 1957 also saw a personal transformation in Sambanthan. While in London for the constitutional talks, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided that Sambanthan needed new attire. Sambanthan had caused some controversy when he wore a dhoti upon being elected into the Federal Legislative Council ‚Äì a practice deemed taboo during the British period. But Sambanthan defended his choice, arguing: ‚ÄúIt makes the average man feel happier.‚Äù Even after the elections in 1955, when he was appointed Minister of Labour, his traditional Indian attire remained intact. Thus when in London, Tunku decided that something must be done. As the Tunku describes in his book Looking Back: ‚ÄúWhen walking with me in London, he was always trailing behind because he could not step out far enough to keep pace with me; or perhaps I walked faster on purpose. One day when we were out for a walk, I led him into Simpson‚Äôs men‚Äôs store in Piccadilly. On reaching there, I said: ‚ÄòCome in; I want to choose a new suit‚Äô, so he followed me inside. ‚ÄùI asked the tailor to fit Sambanthan with a good ready-made suit. He protested, but only briefly, accepting the inevitability, and came out a new man in a new suit ‚Äì West-End tailored, new shirt, new tie, new shoes and socks.‚Äù The Tunku noted that after that incident, Sambanthan was not satisfied with just one suit and secretly went out to buy several more. During the debate on the draft Constitution at the Federal Legislative Council on 10 July 1957, Sambanthan urged greater co- operation between the communities, reminding them that Malaya was a plural society. He told the council: =Working with the Tunku= The MIC's success in the early years was due to the close personal friendship between Malaysia's first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, and Sambanthan. For his part, Sambanthan ran the MIC as a largely informal party, in deference to UMNO, rather than as a political party with definite programmes. In effect, it became a vehicle for distributing patronage (senate and legislative votes, nominations for decorations and awards, licences) to supporters, furnishing the Indian Malaysian vote, and an instrument for the leadership to entrench its role. But patronage was always in short supply and, eventually, rising dissatisfaction with Sambanthan led to a prolonged leadership crisis in the party. =Working with Tun Abdul Razak= When Tun Abdul Razak Hussein succeeded Tunku Abdul Rahman as Malaysia's prime minister, the MIC was forced to become much more responsive to the dictates of UMNO. This was following the May 13 Incident and Razak was more assertive than the Tunku to demonstrate Malay Supremacy or Ketuanan Melayu. Sambanthan, by now bearing the title \\"Tun\\", was forced to retire in favour of V. Manickavasagam in 1973. This intervention is an indication of the inertia that had gripped the MIC following Sambanthan's rise to leadership in 1955. Ministerial posts As president of a party that was a component of the ruling Alliance Party, he was appointed Minister of Labour (1955‚Äì57), Health (1957‚Äì59), Works, Posts and Telecommunications (1959‚Äì71) and National Unity (1972‚Äì74). During the time the Malaysian Government decided to ban the Chinese lion dance and racial tension was high after 13 May 1969, Tun Sambanthan as National Unity Minister in the early 1970s, took some Chinese leaders to Genting to talk things over. The discussions were successful and the lion dance ban was later lifted because the Government realised it was important to maintain each race's culture. Apart from ministerial duties, Tunku Abdul Rahman often assigned important tasks to Sambanthan. In 1968, the Tunku sent Sambanthan to Fiji as an emissary of peace; the Chief Minister of Fiji acknowledged Sambanthan's contribution in a letter to Tunku thanking him for the \\"great success\\" of the delegation \\"under the superb leadership of Tun Sambanthan\\". Sambanthan also joined the delegation to Jakarta, Indonesia in 1966 to witness the signing of an agreement whereby diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Malaysia were normalised after the Indonesian Confrontation episode. V. T. Sambanthan was also acting prime minister for one day when both the prime minister and his deputy were out of the country at the same time.https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/views/2019/06/14/no-reason-to-change- jalan-tun-sambanthans-name/ After resigning as president of MIC, he was appointed chairman of the National Unity Board (1974‚Äì78) that replaced the National Unity Ministry. Throughout his political career, which spanned 25 years, he had preached and practised the doctrine of unity amidst diversity. Appropriately enough, in the Malaysian context, it was to national unity that he devoted the last few years of his life. Contributions In his own way, Sambanthan instituted some reforms among Indian plantation workers. For example, he promoted education and thrift among Indian workers, lobbied for the introduction of English language instruction in Tamil schools in Perak and for the transformation of the South Indian Immigration Labour Fund into an education fund for the children of plantation workers. The greatest challenge that MIC faced during his presidency was the fragmentation of estates, the livelihood of almost all Indian workers. In a bid to help the fragmentation, the party sponsored cooperative efforts to acquire estates and prevent displacement of the workers. In 1960 Tun V.T. Sambanthan touted the idea of a social co-operative to help plantation workers during the British land sell off. Tun Sambanthan and K. R. Somasundram worked closely to purchase their first estate at Bukit Sidim in that same year. The co-operative was later called National Land and Finance Co-operative Society (NLFCS). He toured rubber plantations to persuade workers to buy shares in the cooperative; a worker with a registration fee of $2 and a share costing $100 (payable in instalments) could buy a stake in a plantation. At the time of his death in 1979, the cooperative had bought over 18 estates, totalling 120 km¬≤ and had a membership of 85,000 workers. The Malayan Plantation Agencies administered the estates on behalf of the cooperative. His wife, Toh Puan Umasundari Sambanthan served as chairman and director of the National Land Finance Co- operative Society (NLFC) from 1980 to 1995 and its president in 1995 and 1996. K. R. Somasundram has since taken over the Chairmanship of the company upon the death of Tun Sambanthan and is still actively involved in the co-operative. Today NLFCS has 19 estates totalling , as well as investments in Palm Oil, Property and Banking. Family Tun Sambanthan was married to Toh Puan Umasundari Sambanthan. The couple's daughter, Deva Kunjari, is a lawyer.

Lying east of the town of Skardu, it was the second-largest kingdom in old Baltistan of the Yabgo dynasty. It guarded the trade route to Ladakh along the Shyok River. The Khaplu Valley is almost from Skardu and two hours by jeep. It is a sprawling village located at the confluence of the Indus and the Shyok River in Pakistan. Khaplu is a base for trekking into the Hushe valley which leads to Masherbrum mountains. Many famous mountains, such as Masherbrum, K-6, K-7, Sherpi Kangh, Sia Kangri, Saltoro Kangri and Siachen etc. are located there. According to Forbes Magazine, Khaplu is the coolest place for tourists. Anuually approximate 100 thousand tourists visit Khaplu to see Siachen Glacier and 3rd 4th 5th and 6th highest peak of the world. Khaplu has a mosque naming Chaqchan, a 700 hundred years old mosque, founded by Ameer Kabeer Syed Ali Hamadani(RA). Tourist Places. Hanjor, ThoqsiKhar, Kaldaq, Chaqchan Mosque, and Shyok River view are known tourist places in Khaplu town. History The first mention of the former small kingdom called Kh√°pula is in Mirza Haidar's (1499‚Äì1551) famous work Tarikh-i-Rashidi (p. 410). The author lists the Khaplu district of Balti(stan). Khaplu was also very well known in the 17th and 18th century due to its close political and family ties with the royal family of the neighbouring country of Ladakh. The first European to visit Khaplu was probably Captain Claude Martin Wade (1794‚Äì1861), who mentioned \\"Ch√≠l√∫\\" in 1835 in a Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal essay. Subsequently, William Moorcroft and George Trebeck wrote in their 1841 book (Part II, p 264): \\"Kafalun is a province west of Nobra, on the left bank of the Shayuk.\\" Godfrey Thomas Vigne has Khaplu 1835-1838, relying in particular on the local mountain fortress, commented that he was still in an intact condition vorfand (Part 2, pp. 317f). Alexander Cunningham (p. 28ff), who did not visit Baltistan, published a brief geographical description of Khaplu and a genealogy of its rulers in 1854. Thomas Thomson travelled in November 1847 and briefly described a place of remarkable beauty for Tibet (p. 210ff). Knight reported on his visit to Khaplu (p. 253): \\"This fair spot what Kapalu, the richest district in Baltistan, and Regarded as a very Garden of Eden by the Balti people.\\" Jane E. Duncan reached Khaplu in 1904 and stayed there for three weeks. A detailed report on her stay in Khaplu is well worth reading. De Filippi, who reached Khaplu in 1913, characterized the site as follows: \\"It is, perhaps, the loveliest oasis in all the region.\\" Further information on Khaplu was included in a travel report by Arthur Neve (p. 99f). Recent descriptions can be found in the guidebooks Arora, pp. 211f, Lonely Planet, pp. 306f and Beek, pp. 252ff. Geography  Haldi Cones Khaplu lies at the base of the Karakoram Range. In contrast to Skardu and Shigar, the territory of Khaplu was not focused on a single large river valley, but was instead spread over the three valleys of Shayok, namely on the territory of the present town of Khaplu, the valley of Thalle River, and the Hushe / Saltoro valley. The area around the mouth of the river in the Thalle Shayok formed the western border of the kingdom. Shyok River flows through Khaplu Town. Today Ganache district, whose administrative centre is located in Khaplu, covers Balghar and Daghoni in addition to the mouth of the Indus in Shayok. It includes the former Kingdom of Kiris as a military bulwark of the West against the incursions of the archenemies Skardu and Shigar the mountain fortresses of Kharku were next to a castle in Balghar and saling been built. In Haldi, in eastern Hushe / Saltoro Tal, was another fortress. The fortress in the town of Khar Thortsi Khaplu was viewed as militarily impregnable and the area's most important defence system.  Tourism  Khaplu has been called many names like \\"Shyok Valley,\\" \\"Ghanche\\" and \\"Little Tibet.\\" In Khaplu there are many historical places like the beautiful Chaqchan Mosque (700 years old founded by Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, the first Islam preacher in this area).culture of Batistan, Hassan Hasrat Raja Palace is a beautiful building and the last and best Tibetan-style palace in Pakistan.

There is rafting on the Shyok River and rock climbing places like Biamari Thoqsikhar and DowoKraming (hot spring). = Architecture = Khaplu in autumn. The most important religious monuments in Khaplu are the great Khanqa prayer hall and the Chaqchan Mosque. The former was built in 1712 by Sayyed Mohammad, a saint of the Islamic N≈´rbkahshƒ´ya sect, whose Astana grave monument is in the immediate vicinity. The Astana grave monument has been restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture Pakistan and thereby saved from total disintegration. The Chaqchan Mosque is the largest and most important of the traditional mosques in Baltistan. After Klimburg (p. 155) its establishment as the Amburiq Mosque in Shigar Islamic missionary Sayyed Ali Shah Hamadani is attributed (14th century), which is considered historically as not secured like the Amburiq Mosque.  Transport  Khaplu is only approachable by road. The normal road route into Khaplu is by a link road from the Skardu Valley. There are four or five other road links to Kashmir and Ladakh.Baltistan aik nazar, usaf Abadi A famous all-weather Khaplu-Drass road linked Khaplu with Drass, a city in Ladakh.

It was built to serve the village of Blunsdon, north of Swindon in Wiltshire, England, although located within the boundaries of Purton. History Blunsdon was one of the last stations to be opened by the Midland and South Western Junction Railway in 1895 on a railway that had opened in 1883. It was little more than a single-platform halt, and milk was the main traffic. It also had a single siding, used for such traffic as fertiliser and other agricultural requirements. It was also one of the first stations on the route to be closed. Regular passenger trains stopped calling in 1922, leaving one solitary passenger train service stopping at Blunsdon on a Sunday until 1924. The station closed completely on 1 August 1937 when goods traffic ceased. Heritage railway The site became the headquarters of the Swindon and Cricklade Railway in the late 1970s because it offered the best road access to the trackbed between Swindon and Cricklade. By that time, almost every trace of the original station had gone, and the present structures are all new. Blunsdon station offers a variety of services including the Swindon and Cricklade railway shop, canteen/buffet, toilets and car parking space.

Playing career McNab began his career in 1972 with Greenock Morton where he made 14 appearances before 1974, becoming the club's youngest ever professional. He was signed by Tottenham Hotspur and became their youngest ever first team player at age 16. He made 72 appearances for Spurs, scoring 3 goals. He played for the Scottish national team at the U-15, U-18 and U-21 levels. In November 1978 he was transferred to Bolton Wanderers for a fee of ¬£250,000, making 35 appearances and scoring 4 goals, before Brighton and Hove Albion acquired his services for the fee of ¬£220,000 in February 1980. During 1982 he played in loan spells at Leeds United and Portsmouth. Then in 1983 he signed for ¬£35,000 for Manchester City with whom he stayed until 1990. He was arguably City's player of the eighties, being voted Player of the Year in both the 1986‚Äì87 and 1988‚Äì89 seasons. A skilful and very combative defensive midfielder, Neil inspired a young team to promotion from the Second Division in 1989. He played 221 league matches for City and scored 16 goals. He left for Tranmere Rovers in January 1990 for ¬£125,000, the third six-figure move of his career, and played over 100 first- team games for them, including two Associate Members' Cup finals at Wembley; winning one of them in 1990.

During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Tlaxcala allied with the Spaniards against the Aztecs, supplying a large contingent for ‚Äì and at times the majority of ‚Äì the Spanish-led army that eventually destroyed the Aztec empire. History A Map of Tlaxcala: The top-right hand sector is Tizatlan, the bottom-right hand sector Quiahuiztlan, the top-left hand sector Ocotelolco, and the bottom-left hand sector Tepeticpac. The river, Atzompa, crosses the city from north to south (left to right, the map being oriented along an east‚Äìwest axis). From Alfredo Chavero, Pintures Jeroglificas, Mexico 1901. Tlaxcaltec√¢ allies accompany Hern√°n Cort√©s during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, 1519, from the History of Tlaxcala. The Tlaxcalans arrived in Central Mexico during the Late Postclassic. They first settled near Texcoco in the valley of Mexico, between the settlement of Cohuatlinchan and the shore of Lake Texcoco. After some years the Tlaxcallans were driven out of the valley of Mexico and moved to the east, splitting into three groups along the way. While one group continued north towards the modern state of Hidalgo and another remained in the vicinity of Texcoco, a third group arrived to the modern valley of Tlaxcala, where they established the city of Tepet√≠cpac Texcallan under the leadership of Culhuatecuhtli Quanex. Over the subsequent years, the Tlaxcallan state expanded with the foundations of Ocotelulco and Tizatl√°n. The fourth major settlement, Quiahuiztlan, was founded by members of the Tlaxcallan group that had initially remained in the valley of Mexico. Ancient Tlaxcala was a republic ruled by a council of between 50 and 200 chief political officials (teuctli [sg.], teteuctin [pl.]) (Fargher et al. 2010). These officials gained their positions through service to the state, usually in warfare, and as a result came from both the noble (pilli) and commoner (macehualli) classes. Tlaxcala was never conquered by the Aztec empire, but was engaged in a state of perpetual war, the so-called flower wars or garland wars. Conquistador Bernal D√≠az del Castillo describes the first battle between the Spanish force and the Tlaxcalteca as surprisingly difficult. He writes that they probably would not have survived, had not Xicotencatl the Elder, and Maxixcatzin, persuaded Xicotencatl the Younger - the Tlaxcallan warleader - that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, Xicohtencatl the Younger was later condemned by the Tlaxcaltecan ruling council and hanged by Cort√©s for desertion in April 1521 during the siege of Tenochtitlan. As a result of their alliance with the Spaniards, Tlaxcala had hidalgo privileged status within Spanish colonial Mexico. After the Spanish conquered Tenochtitlan and the rest of Mexico, Tlaxcala was allowed to survive and preserve its pre-Columbian culture. In addition, as a reward to the Tlaxcalans unyielding loyalty to the Spanish, the city and its inhabitants largely escaped the pillaging and destruction following the Spanish conquest. Due to protracted warfare between the Aztecs and the Tlaxcala, the Tlaxcala were eager to exact revenge, and soon became loyal allies of the Spanish. Even after the Spanish were expelled from Tenochtitlan, the Tlaxcala continued to support their conquest. Tlaxcala also assisted the Spanish in the conquest of Guatemala.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 79‚Äì81. Following the Spanish Conquest, Tlaxcala was divided into four fiefdoms (se√±or√≠os) by the Spanish corregidor G√≥mez de Santill√°n in 1545 (26 years after the Conquest). These fiefdoms were Ocotelolco, Quiahuiztlan, Tepeticpac, and Tizatlan. At this time, four great houses or lineages emerged and claimed hereditary rights to each fiefdom and created fictitious genealogies extending back into the pre-Columbian era to justify their claims. Gibson, 1952. During the colonial period, the Tlaxcalan people were regarded as being of higher status and received better treatment compared to the other indigenous peoples of New Spain. However, the indigenous population who had been living in Tlaxcala were reduced to a small minority. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, in 1625 the city of Tlaxcala had only 700 people, compared to a population of 300,000 a century earlier, owing to epidemics, emigrations, and the work of digging the canal of Nochistongo to drain the Valley of Mexico.

Parentage Born in St. John's, Newfoundland Colony, he was the son of Norman Bradley and Evangeline Trimm. Education and employment Bradley became the principal of the Methodist School in Bonavista after finishing his education at Methodist College in 1906. Three years later, he studied law at Dalhousie University and was called to the bar in 1915. Later he started his own law practice. Politics In 1924, he was elected to the House of Assembly representing the electoral district of Port de Grave. A Conservative, he was a Minister without Portfolio in the cabinet of Walter Stanley Monroe until he resigned from the caucus in 1926 to sit as an Independent. He was re-elected in 1928 representing the electoral district of Trinity Centre as a Liberal and served as Minister without Portfolio and Solicitor-General in the cabinet of Richard Squires. Re- elected in 1932, as only one of two Liberals, he was the leader of the opposition. An opponent of the creation of the Commission of Government, he returned to his law practice in 1933. Newfoundland National Convention In 1947 Bradley was elected to sit in the Newfoundland National Convention. After the death of Cyril J. Fox he became the chairman. The London and Ottawa Delegations The Newfoundland National Convention dispatched two delegations, one to the United Kingdom (the \\"London Delegation\\") and one to Canada (the \\"Ottawa Delegation\\"). London Delegation The London Delegation was unsuccessful in its attempt to get the promise of continued financial aid if Newfoundland were to resume Responsible Government. Ottawa Delegation The Ottawa Delegation negotiated terms of union for Confederation between Newfoundland and Canada in 1947. Its members (with their districts) were: * T. G. W. Ashbourne (Twillingate) * F. G. Bradley (Bonavista South) * Charles Ballam (Humber) * Lester Burry (Labrador) * P. W. Crummey (Bay de Verde) * Joey Smallwood (Bonavista Centre) The negotiations were largely a one way affair. Any union with Canada was dictated by the British North America Act (BNA), under which Canada had come into being in 1867. Post-Confederation After Confederation with Canada, he was appointed Secretary of State for Canada by Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, making him the first Canadian federal cabinet minister from Newfoundland. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing the riding of Bonavista‚ÄîTwillingate in the 1949 federal election.

The Shyok River originates at the Rimo Glacier, one of the tongues of Siachen Glacier. The alignment of the Shyok river is very unusual, originating from the Rimo glacier, it flows in a southeasterly direction and, joining the Pangong range, it takes a northwestern turn, flowing parallel to its previous path. The Shyok valley widens at the confluence with the Nubra River but suddenly turns into a narrow gorge near Yagulung (), continuing through Bogdang, Turtuk and Tyakshi before crossing into Baltistan. The river joins the Indus at Keris, east of the town of Skardu.Aerial view of river junction The Nubra river, originating from the Siachen glacier, also behaves like the Shyok. Before Diskit, the SE flowing river Nubra takes a NW turn on meeting the river Shyok.

It may be in the form of individual television programs or dedicated specialty channels that is often associated with cable television in the United States as Public, educational, and government access (PEG) channel providers. There are also adult education programs for an older audience; many of these are instructional television or \\"telecourse\\" services that can be taken for college credit. Examples of these include Open University programs on BBC television in the UK. Many children's television series are educational, ranging from dedicated learning programs to those that indirectly teach the viewers. Some series are written to have a specific moral behind every episode, often explained at the end by the character that learned the lesson. In the social aspects of television, several studies have found that educational television has many advantages. The Media Awareness Network, explains in its article, The Good Things about Television, that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. The article states that television can help young people discover where they fit into society, develop closer relationships with peers and family, and teach them to understand complex social aspects of communication. Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s the use of telenovela to disseminate the government's policy views to mass audiences.Hanna Rosin, \\"Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World.\\" The New Yorker, June 5, 2006, pp. 40-46.Gabriela Soto Laveaga, \\"'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world.\\" Sexuality Research and Social Policy.

Examples * Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) * Annenberg Foundation (The Annenberg Channel) * NASA TV * TVOntario * Discovery Channel The television medium can and has been used for a multitude of educational purposes. Some television programs are explicitly educational, while others only incidentally so. Some formats blend the two in the attempt to amuse but also retain some educational value. TV reforms for education-based programs In the time of TV vs. Radio, the early 1960s were an era of change. Historian Michael Curtin recounted that then-FCC-chair, Jon Doerfor and TV network heads, had come to an agreement that most of TV was based on commercialism and emphasized entertainment too much. To help counterbalance this, there was a plan organized to produce more serious news and documentary programs. This policy was placed just in time for networks to expand their news coverage on the Kennedy-Nixon campaigns and debates. This increase in coverage stirred up the polls as those who saw the debates, with Kennedy's good looks and camera confidence, decided he had won, whereas those who listened were more impressed with Nixon.Hilmes, Michele, \\"Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States\\" Pg. 219, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2011 By 1962, TV reform was in full swing, and 400 prime- time documentaries had been produced, as opposed to a total of zero back in 1957. Curtin noted that news programs were extended to full half-hour segments, and foreign and domestic issues were receiving heightened degrees of attention.Hilmes, Michele, \\"Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States\\" Pg. 219-220, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2011 Edutainment and Telenovelas Some television programs are designed with primarily educational purposes in mind, although they might rely heavily on entertainment to communicate their educational messages. In children's programing, edutainment becomes fun and interesting for the child but can still be educational. Other television programs are designed to raise social awareness. One form of edutainment popular in Latin America is the educational telenovela. Miguel Sabido, a producer of telenovelas from the 1970s on, has combined communication theory with pro-health/education messages to educate audiences throughout Latin America about family planning, literacy, and other topics. He developed a model which incorporated the work of Albert Bandura and other theorists, as well as research to determine whether programs impacted audience behavior. The first ever television series produced in the Pacific Island country of Vanuatu, entitled Love Patrol and launched in 2007, was praised as an edutainment series, as it aimed to educate viewers on the issue of AIDS, while simultaneously providing an entertaining story.\\"Health: LOVE PATROL\\" , Nicole Gooch, Islands Business The Hulu Original TV series East Los High, is backed by a health initiative to teach healthy sexual behaviors (e.g. using protection during sexual intercourse, getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases). Entertainment Some television shows incorporate a considerable degree of historical or factual information while attempting to make the presentation or framing of such content entertaining or exciting. By making learning seem \\"exciting\\" they can be said to stimulate curiosity. The presence of edutainment is especially evident in children's television series, such as Sesame Street, Teletubbies, and Dora the Explorer. Discovery Channel is also known for its various shows that follow that theme, including MythBusters. Sometimes these programs may be more entertaining than educational, and may replace educational shows in the televisions program lineup. The History Channel has transitioned from producing primarily factual and historical documentaries, to more sensational, dramatic, and supposedly entertaining programs, with educational content a secondary concern. Television series notable for negative reception, from around the world, either by published critics, by network executives or by audience response, can be judged based on poor quality, the lack of a budget, rapid cancellation, very low viewership, offensive content, and/or negative impact on other series on the same channel. In some cases, a show that is acceptable on its own merits can be put in a position where it does not belong and be judged \\"worst ever.\\" In many cases, \\"worst television series ever\\" lists are slanted toward more contemporary shows, in recent memory. The Children's Television Act of 1990, which was first fully enforced in 1996, requires broadcast television stations in the United States to carry a minimum of three hours of \\"educational/informational\\" programming geared directly at children. The move prompted an exodus of non-educational children's programming to cable television and largely failed in its efforts to expand the amount of educational television on the airwaves (in fact, children's television in general has declined significantly on broadcast television since the act was imposed, although it can be argued that the E/I regulations could very well be the only thing keeping children's television on broadcast airwaves in the 2010s). Incidental educational value Some programs are primarily aimed at entertainment, but may contain an incidental amount of educational content. Educational content may be inherent to the design of the show, such as with medical dramas where the plot invariably explores anatomical and biological issues. The Sentinel Award, which is administered by the University of Southern California's Annenberg Center for Communication, the CDC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is given each year to programs that address health and medical issues in their storylines. 2006's nominees/winners include: * Numb3rs - for a storyline about fighting crime using mathematics. * Grey's Anatomy - for story lines about organ transplantation and cancer. * As the World Turns - for a breast cancer storyline that involved a major character. * George Lopez - for a storyline about a kidney transplant. * Ben & Izzy - for a storyline about two children, Ben from America and Izzy from Jordan, who form a close bond despite their different cultural backgrounds. While some programs are typically \\"pure\\" entertainment, they may foray into educational content at select times. For older viewers, individual situation comedy episodes also occasionally serve as educational entertainment vehicles. These episodes are sometimes described in United States television commercial parlance as very special episodes. As early as the 1950s, children-aimed shows like \\"Watch Mr Wizard\\" were made which could be considered edutainment. On the other hand, some programs may seem for the lay public to contain educational content, but are actually completely fictional.

This practice was also part of the patron- client relation system of Roman society. The term was coined by French historian Andr√© Boulanger and subsequently used in the works of Paul Veyne. Development of euergetism in the Hellenistic period Inscription honoring Aristoxenos, son of Demophon probably benefactor of the gymnasium in Athens, late third or second century BC., Mus√©e du Louvre. During the second half of the 4th century BC, profound changes occurred in the financing of public institutions. Without the backing or funding from the wealthy, at least symbolically, the legitimacy of these institutions could be called into question by the city. The idea emerged that the rich people were not contributing unless required or compelled to do so. At the same time, around 355 BC, Demosthenes mentioned the lack of funding from the wealthy in the Against Leptines and Xenophon in Poroi. At the end of the century, Demetrius Phalereus abolished the two most important Athenian liturgies. The trierarchy, the building of triremes, was no longer necessary because Athens withdrew from the international arena after his defeat at 322, and choregy, was replaced by a judiciary elective, \\"the presidential contest (agonoth√©sie), whose funding was supported by the State\\". However, many honorary degrees in honor agonothetai were available, showing that the amounts incurred by them voluntarily to supplement those supported by the city far exceeded the cost of the former choregy. Thus, in 284/3, the agonothetai elected, the poet Philippides, ceased to be reimbursed by the city money it advanced. Similarly, some old magistrates were often funded by their owner: Athens, priests generally provided the victims of sacrifice, when the cosmetic and continues to oversee the ephebia in the Hellenistic period, that is now on his own money that finances most of the sacrifices, prizes for competitions, and routine maintenance of equipment and buildings. Although no document mentions as such that the holder of the office shall assume the financial cost of its charge, entries published annually in his honor shows that oversees the flow of the institution, some emphasizing that this city does not have to spend this year. Thus gradually it was chosen to operate close to the philanthropy, which, like Aristotle wrote, \\"to safeguard the oligarchs\\" for the most important [...], magistrates must attach their public expenditure, so that people do not agree to participate and have the same indulgence to the judges that they must pay their judiciaries of a large sum.Aristotle, Politics, VI, 7, 6 Therefore, \\"at their facility, judges will make magnificent sacrifices, and build some monuments and the people, then taking part in the banquets and feasts, and seeing the city splendidly decorated temples and buildings, wish to maintain the constitution and it will be for the rich as many beautiful testimonies of items they made. However, until the middle of the 2nd century BC., the Greek philanthropy did not match the definition in Veyne. As demonstrated Philip Gauthier,Philippe Gauthier, Les cit√©s grecques et leurs bienfaiteurs, Athens- Paris, 1985 (BCH, Suppl. XII) this is a philanthropy that takes place most often \\"exclusively in official and civil (judicial and official business)\\". Moreover, in the 4th century BC and perhaps even the high Hellenistic period, the city did not create for his benefactors (benefactors) of separate status, superior to other citizens, and it recognizes their quality and not the title of benefactor. She thanked them and \\"get up with his service as any other citizen, but with higher average\\", the same way that voluntary contributions (epidoseis) enabled everyone, in proportion to his income, to demonstrate its commitment to the city by a gift of many talents or just a few pence. Euergetism, as they developed next to a liturgical system \\"which is both a continuation and denial\\", allowed the city to direct its service expenditures of the richest of its members with greater emphasis before the official honors due to them in thanks. The latter could thus be obtained, whenever necessary, that funding is assured for the most urgent of needs, without incurring unnecessary costs, and without giving the feeling of stress to members of its elite, which retain the ability to book their wealth to their personal use. The gradual disappearance of the liturgies occurred in the shift of the vocabulary of the Hellenistic period: the name - and the verb - loses its meaning strictly \\"expenditure imposed by the city\\" to mean \\"any part taken in an expenditure of public interest\\", including in conjunction with a public office (Judicial or priesthood). This dilution of the immune system from euergetism to liturgy will be completed towards the end of the Hellenistic period. Financing Cities can then be compared to that in force throughout the Roman Empire at that time, the full Euergetism analyzed by Veyne in his book Bread and Circuses.  Hellenistic generosity  Hellenistic generosity is a social practice where rich people help out poor ones. It appeared in the Hellenistic world for the first time. This became a moral obligation for the wealthy citizens when seeking high magistrate positions in the Roman Republic, such as consul, praetor or aedile. The notion of generosity towards poorer citizens included provision for entertainments, civic banquets, but also city amenities such as theatres, odeions (concert and lecture halls), libraries, baths, gymnasiums, fountains and markets which bore the inscription so and so built or repaired this (, \\"done with his own money\\").  End of euergetism  From the 3rd century AD on, economic pressures made euergetism more difficult to practice, and was largely replaced with imperial funds taken from the provincial or diocesan budgets. Private euergetism eventually disappeared after Justinian's death and was replaced by the ecclesial charitable schemes. Notes  Bibliography  * * Roland Oetjen: An Economic Model of Greek Euergetism.

These bounties often backfired and turned communist leaders into folk heroes The Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), often mistranslated as the Malayan Races Liberation Army, was a communist guerrilla army that fought for Malayan independence from the British Empire during the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960) and later fought against the Malaysian government in the Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968‚Äì1989). Their leader was an anti-fascist and trade union activist known as Chin Peng who had previously been awarded an OBE by the British for waging a guerrilla war against the Japanese occupation of Malaya. Many MNLA fighters were former members of the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) which had been previously trained and funded by the British to fight against Japan during WWII. In 1989 the Malayan Communist Party signed a peace treaty with the Malaysian state and the MNLA and the Party settled in villages in southern Thailand. Name and mistranslation Malayan Races Liberation Army is a translation from the Chinese È©¨Êù•‰∫öÊ∞ëÊóèËß£ÊîæÂÜõ where Ê∞ëÊóè means \\"nationality\\" in the ethnic sense. The organization's leader Chin Peng has called this a mistranslation and corrected it to Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA). The name of the MNLA in Malay () could also be translated as the Malayan People's Liberation Army although extant records show that the title Tentera Pembebasan Nasional Malaya or MNLA became the normal self-identity by the 1970s. History The MNLA was a guerrilla force created by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Many MNLA fighters were previously members of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), another guerrilla force which the British had secretly trained and armed during World War II to fight against the Japanese Occupation. The Communist Party, which had been banned in the pre-war years, was thereafter granted legal recognition by the British after the war as a reward for its wartime effort but had secretly kept some of the MPAJA's weapons for future use. The MCP used violence to support its union organisation, and the British used restrictions, including banishing key communist leaders not born locally, in an attempt to restrict trade union activity. This mutual antagonism climaxed with an armed revolt in 1948, which resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency in June 1948. = The Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960) = On the 16th June 1948, three British plantation managers were assassinated in Perak. In response to these murders the British colonial authorities enacted emergency measures which included outlawing leftist parties and conducting mass arrests of trade union activists and communists. Fleeing the cities, Malayan Communist Party activists and their supporters (including Chin Peng) regrouped deep in the Malayan jungles and founded the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), a guerrilla army to wage armed resistance against British. In an attempt to force the British to leave Malaya, the MNLA conducted attacks against soldiers, police, colonial collaborators, and conducted industrial sabotage. During the early years of the Emergency, the MNLA guerrillas would destroy rubber plantations in an attempt to harm the British economy whose war-time debt to the Americans and post-war social programs partially relied on the profits of the Malayan rubber trade. These guerrillas were supported by a network of civilian supporters called the Min Yuen, whose members would live a normal life in towns while gathering intelligence, recruiting new members, spreading propaganda and collecting supplies for the MNLA. The MNLA allowed people of any race as well as women to join the guerrilla army as any prejudice between race and sex was believed by the MNLA and MCP to be a tool of capitalism to divide the working class. Due to their location deep within Malaya's jungles, the MNLA often came into contact with the aboriginal Orang Asli, recruiting them as trackers and using their villages as a food source. However, despite their attempts to recruit from all ethnic backgrounds, the MNLA membership was still overwhelmingly made up of ethnic Chinese. Less than a month into the Emergency, Britain's High Commissioner in Malaya Edward Gent died in an airplane collision. In 1951 his replacement, Henry Gurney was killed by MNLA guerrillas in an ambush against his convoy near Fraser's Hill resort. The next High Commissioner was Gerald Templer who is credited by many historians as being the most effective in defeating the MNLA guerrillas. Templer oversaw the finalising of the Briggs' Plan, the British military strategy to defeat Malayan communism by destroying rural villages and imprisoning thousands of ethnic Chinese-Malayans in a system of internment camps called \\"new villages\\"s. By early 1952 over 400,000 people (mostly ethnic Chinese) had been imprisoned in New Village internment camps and deprived of all civil rights. Templer then attempted to starve the MNLA out of the jungles by destroying farmland, spraying chemical herbacides from airplanes to destroy crops, and enforcing a food rationing system for Malayan villagers so that they could not share food with MNLA members. In Tanjung Malim, the British halved food rations on the town after the population refused to give them information on communist activities. The British resorted to collective punishment and enacted a 22-hour curfew on all civilians, then surrounded the town in barbed wire and sentry towers. The Briggs Plan and the New Village internment camps had succeeded in segregating the civilian population from the MNLA guerrillas in the jungles and severely damaged their ability to continue fighting. The food denial campaign also put great pressure on the MNLA and damaged their ability to conduct assaults against British positions. The Emergency officially came to an end in 1960, although the MNLA had already been defeated as an effective fighting force for years. =Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968‚Äì1989)= Defeated in the first Malayan emergency and outwitted in Singapore politics by nationalist politician Lee Kuan Yew, the MCP by the mid-1960s was fragmented. However, in 1968 the MNLA reappeared and operated from across the Thai border and carried out ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, as well as laid traps for Malaysian military. The MNLA fought in the highly forested area near the Thai border in the north of the Malay peninsula. The MNLA was not able to reform to its former size and the MCP began recruitment of Thai Malays as well as distributing pamphlets preaching the compatibility between Islam and Communism. The MNLA had some success early on in the insurgency, at one point killing 17 members of the security forces in a single attack. In 1989, the MCP came to the negotiating table and reached an agreement with the Malaysian government which would allow MCP/MNLA members to return to Malaysia if they laid down their arms. Some MCP/MNLA members settled in \\"peace villages\\" in Southern Thailand, while others returned to Malaysia. However, Secretary-General of the MCP Chin Peng was subsequently denied the right to return to Malaysia in spite of the agreement between the MCP and the government.

Produced by Bernard Delfont, Pickwick premiered in the West End in 1963, with Harry Secombe in the lead role and choreography by Gillian Lynne. Plot Set in England in 1828, the story centres on wealthy Samuel Pickwick and his valet Sam Weller, who are in a debtors' prison where they recall the misadventures that led to their imprisonment. On the previous Christmas Eve, Pickwick introduced his friend Wardle, Wardle's daughters, Emily and Isabella, and their Aunt Rachael to Nathaniel Winkle, Augustus Snodgrass, and Tracy Tupman, three members of the Pickwick Club. They were soon joined by Alfred Jingle, who tricked Tupman into paying for his ticket to a ball that evening. Upon learning Rachael is an heiress, Jingle set out to win her hand and eventually succeeded. Pickwick engages Sam Weller as his valet and, through a series of misunderstandings, he inadvertently leads his landlady, Mrs. Bardell, to believe he has proposed marriage to her. Pickwick is charged with breach of promise and hauled into court, where he is found guilty as charged and sentenced to prison when he stubbornly refuses to pay her compensation.

The New York production was directed by Peter Coe, choreographed by Lynne, and featured Harry Secombe as Pickwick, Charlotte Rae as Mrs. Bardell, Roy Castle as Sam Weller, Nancy Haywood as Isabella, Michael Logan as Mr. Wardle, and Peter Bull as Sgt. Buzfuz. The best-known song from the score is \\"If I Ruled The World\\", which not only became the signature tune for Harry Secombe, but was covered by Tony Bennett, Sammy Davis Jr. and many other vocalists. In 1969 the BBC made Pickwick, a TV movie of the musical which again starred Harry Secombe as Mr. Pickwick, and with Roy Castle as Sam Weller.

Description Until the early 1990s, Psyri, one of the oldest quarters of Athens, had an ill reputation, but it has now become one of the most fashionable and trendy choices in the centre of Athens for accommodation, entertainment and food hospitality. The central square of Psyri is called \\"Heroes square\\" (œÄŒªŒ±œÑŒµŒØŒ± ŒóœÅœéœâŒΩ, plateia Iroon), because the streets leading to it carry names of heroes of the Greek War of Independence (e.g. Karaiskakis, Miaoulis).

History It opened by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway on 2 July 1883 as Barton Street, serving the route from Southport Chapel Street to Wigan. It was then renamed three months later as Southport St Luke's Road. On 1 March 1902, the station was renamed again as Southport St Luke's, and in June of that year it began serving the Preston line, absorbing the adjacent Southport Ash Street railway station. The two platforms were almost at right angles to each other, both separated by a road named Hart Street. They did, however, share the same ticket office, located on the street at St Luke's Road. On 22 March 1904 the Preston line was electrified all the way up to Crossens,Marshall, p.78 and enabled a regular service to stop at St Luke's. In May 1914, the station was finally named St Luke's. =Decline and closure= Trains to Preston (including the Crossens electric shuttle) ended when the line was closed on 7 September 1964, a victim of the Beeching Axe.Marshall, p.152 However the station did not close as some trains bound for Wigan still used part of the route. The direct line to Wigan then closed on 14 June 1965 with trains being diverted via Meols Cop and a section of the old branch line to Altcar to allow the closure of the busy level crossing at Blowick. The end of St Luke's station came when the Preston platform, still serving a number of trains, finally closed on 9 September 1968. Today, the site of the Wigan platforms have been built over with a modern housing development, but the tracks widen at a point where the Preston platform used to stand and can be clearly seen by passing trains.

A close aid of Mr. Bhutto during his time in power, he retired from all active politics after the government's removal by the army in 1977. He was born in the Indian hill station town of Shimla, although his family is native to Multan. Educated at Aitchison College, Lahore, he was forced into responsibility at a young age after his father was killed during the partition. At the time Sadiq Hussain Qureshi was only 20 years old. He turned his attention to politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Starting on the district council level as a vice chairman, he rose through the political ranks, being elected as a Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA), a Member of the National Assembly (MNA) and then being appointed advisor to the Governor. He assumed the post of Agriculture Minister Punjab in 1971. A member of the Pakistan Peoples Party he was chosen by Prime Minister Bhutto as Governor of the Punjab, a post he held from November 1973 to March 1975. He was then elevated to the position of Chief Minister Punjab, where he served until the imposition of Martial law in July 1977.

Currently, Kirks is owned, manufactured, and distributed by Coca-Cola Amatil.Company website, retrieved 03/01/2015 Kirks produces a wide selection of soft drink flavours available throughout Australia. In 2014, Kirks launched a new line of limited edition original flavours, \\"Kirks Surprises\\". From the Surprises range, Watermelonade, and Enchanted Fruits were produced in collaboration with Chupa Chups. History =Before Kirks= The Helidon Spa Water Company was founded in 1881 as a partnership between chemist Reginald Larard, and Scottish entrepreneur Gilbert E. Primrose to bottle the spring water of Helidon, Queensland. In May 1897 competitor Alfred Lucas Gardner, trading as Owen Gardner and Sons since 1850 was sued by the Helidon Spa Water Company for \\"infringement of his patent rights in connection with the sale of Helidon Spa water\\". This prevented Gardner and Sons from using the words ‚ÄòHelidon‚Äô or ‚ÄòSpa Water‚Äô on their bottles or advertisements, until a similar suit against Edward Campbell of the 'Brisbane Aerated Water Company' was appealed and the rules were relaxed. After Gardner's death in 1888, the business was left to his sons Alfred and Ernest, and following the death of Arthur in 1917, management duties were maintained by a Mr T. Kirkpatrick. With chemist W Doolan, Kirkpatrick developed 'Kirk's Ginger Ale', which would go on to become the company's flagship product. During the 1930s, Kirkpatrick left Owen Gardener & Sons to work for main competitor, Brisbane bottler 'Tristram's', selling 'Kirk's Ginger Beer' under their brand. For this, Tristram's were taken to court by then Owen Gardner & Sons' owner Robert Sweeney, asserting their exclusive right to the Kirk's name. Winning the case, the popularity of kirk's (now lowercase) later led the company to use the name for their soft drink products as a whole. In 1959, to compete with competition from imported products such as Coca-Cola, the long time competitors, Helidon Spa Water Company, and Owen Gardner & Sons merged to form Helidon Gardner Pty Ltd, trading together under the popular name \\"kirk's\\". Tristram's was also invited to take part in the merger, but declined. Though the claim \\"Since 1865\\" is present on Kirks' current packaging, what event this date refers to is unclear, as it does not coincide with either the founding date of Helidon Spa Water Company, Owen Gardner & Sons, or the establishment of the Kirks name itself. =1980s= During the nineteen-eighties, the Kirks, Shelleys (NSW) and Gest (WA) brands shared a range of drinks with consistent packaging style and marketing material. Each brand was marketed to its own state of origin. =Merger= In 2000, now under Coca-Cola Amatil, the brands Kirks, Shelleys and Gest, along with Halls (SA), and Marchants, were unified, all taking the name of the Queensland bottler nationwide. The relaunch campaign aimed to evoke nostalgia for the door to door soft drink delivery by local brands in the 1960s to early 80's. Remnants of the original structure remain, as some flavours traditionally produced by local bottlers are only available in certain states. In 2006, Kirks' packaging and advertising materials were redesigned, and again in 2014 with a more modern look. Products Much of Kirks' range originates from flavours originally produced by smaller bottlers prior to acquisition by Kirks, or the 2000 merger under Coca-Cola Amatil. A number of products remain available only in the region of its original manufacturer. Some are still considered local icons. Kirks' ginger Ale was originally sold by Owen Gardner & Sons before the company was merged with the Helidon Spa Water Company to become \\"kirk's\\" in 1959. Before the 2000 merger under Coca-Cola Amatil, Kirks sold its creaming soda under the name \\"Kandy\\". Fruita and Sno Drop were originally products of Halls, whereas Kole Beer was produced by Gest. The brand's \\"Olde Stoney\\" ginger beer originates its name from the stone pottery bottles that non-alcoholic ginger beer was sold in during the 1800s. Kirks Originals: Creaming Soda, Lemonade, Big Sars, Old Stoney Ginger Beer, Lemon Squash, Pasito, Portello, Ginger Ale (QLD Only), Kole Beer (WA Only), Sno Drop (SA Only), Fruita (VIC, SA & TAS Only) Kirks Surprises Limited Edition: Strawberries and Cream, Watermelonade (watermelon Chupa Chup), Lime Spider, Enchanted Fruits (raspberry, blackberry and strawberry Chupa Chup) , Sticky Toffee Apple, Tropical Bluetopia (pineapple and berry), Summer Sorbet (mango and peach), Fizzy Flamingo (peach and raspberry), Sunny Stardust (pineapple and strawberry).

He was born in British India, educated at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford, and served in the Second World War as an artillery officer with British Indian units in Malaya. Captured by the Japanese in Singapore, he was forced to work on the Burma Railway. He taught classics at Shrewsbury, where he became a housemaster, and taught for another year at Christ Church. He was headmaster of Bradfield College, where he raised academic standards and instituted a substantial programme of new building works. Appointed headmaster of Eton College in 1963, he broadened the curriculum immensely and introduced a greater focus on achieving strong examination results, but was asked to leave in 1969 after disagreements with housemasters and an unpopular attitude to caning, which became the subject of a press controversy after his death. Following a one-year break during which he taught for one term at the prep school Swanbourne House, he was appointed headmaster of Fettes College, where he succeeded in greatly increasing enrolment and in reforming the harsh traditional atmosphere of the school. He died while still headmaster there. Family and early years He was born into, on his father's side, a family of Anglo-Irish descent. He was the son of Charles Godfrey Chenevix Trench (1877‚Äì1964) and Margaret May Blakesley. His father was in the Indian Civil Service. His great-grandfather was The Most Rev. Dr Richard Chenevix Trench (1807‚Äì1886), Church of Ireland Lord Archbishop of Dublin, a senior-ranking Anglo-Irish cleric, and his cousin Charles was a British Indian Army officer, colonial official and writer. Anthony Chenevix- Trench, born at Kasauli in India on 10 May 1919, was the youngest of four sons born to the couple, the older ones being Christopher, Richard and Godfrey. In the first few years of his life the family visited Britain and various other countries, returning to India in 1922 where his father worked as part of a three-man commission in the picturesque city of Udaipur making recommendations on the vexed issue of land reform in the Rajput state of Mewar. Anthony was to spend three years in India, living in traditional colonial luxury with a staff of twelve including an English nanny and an Indian ayah, riding with the Mewar state cavalry on his pony while wearing a lancer's uniform tailored down to his size, and moving to the foothills of the Himalayas to avoid the heat of the summer. Education The family returned to England in 1925, moving to Somerset in 1927; Chenevix-Trench attended school for the first time in Westgate-on-Sea in Kent. He had already been introduced to classical literature by his father, reading Herodotus at the age of six. His mother Margaret would always read to the children ‚Äì who by now included all four brothers and Philippa Tooth whom the Chenevix-Trenches looked after while her parents remained in India ‚Äì at bedtime, including G. K. Chesterton, Kipling, and Greek and Roman myths. Towards the end of his life Chenevix-Trench described how this had inspired him, and said that \\"the words still sing in my mind like music\\". At age eight he was sent to board at the prep school Highfield in Hampshire, where the headmaster Canon W.R. Mills was described as \\"a hard taskmaster in Latin\\". Chenevix-Trench was a contemporary there of Ludovic Kennedy, whom he helped with Greek prose composition, Anthony Storr and Robin Maugham; all three of these were later scathing of the headmaster's extensive use of the cane on his young charges. In his early years there, Chenevix-Trench spent more than a year away from the school due to lung congestion, suspected rheumatic fever, and problems with sleepwalking. But he quickly resumed progress, writing prose and poetry described as \\"highly polished\\" for the school magazine, and being successful at boxing, though he was too small to excel at most of the team sports. He was popular through sheer enthusiasm rather than physical prowess, and in his penultimate year founded an unofficial school club in which boys would crawl about in the school's lofts in their pyjamas ‚Äì the subsequent myth was that he fell through the headmaster's own ceiling and was thoroughly caned on the spot. Despite all this, Chenevix-Trench won a scholarship to Shrewsbury School while still aged twelve, and was a prefect in his last term at Highfield. At Shrewsbury, Chenevix-Trench was described as \\"one of the best classical scholars\\". At the time, H.H. Hardy was headmaster, described as a \\"strict disciplinarian\\" who maintained the school's \\"rich Classical tradition, sporting fanaticism, fervent house loyalties, robust discipline and unseemly squalor\\". Chenevix- Trench was small for his age, but charmed both teachers and other pupils with his wit and enthusiasm, took part in a wide variety of sports, and continued to excel academically, winning a host of prizes. He became a house monitor at age sixteen, and head of School House the following year. Francis King, who was a thirteen-year-old in his first year at the school at the time, described Chenevix-Trench as \\"a supercilious, capricious and cruel head of house\\". The majority did not share this view, and Robin Lorimer, Chenevix-Trench's best friend at Shrewsbury, noted that Chenevix-Trench was merely upholding a rule then in force that even the most trivial mistakes by younger boys must be punished with four strokes of the cane by the monitors, but did not gloat over the effects. By this time Chenevix-Trench had already gained a Classics Scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, at age sixteen. Winning an academic scholarship of ¬£100 a year to support himself at Christ Church, Chenevix- Trench was housed in Peckwater Quad for his first two years there. At Christ Church Chenevix-Trench won further academic prizes, but not, in his first two years, the ones he most wanted. He was housed in Peckwater Quad, and rowed in the college's Second VIII. He greatly appreciated his surroundings, writing home that \\"Oxford in sunshine is a dream city ‚Äì made to be seen in summer\\". He was elected to the Twenty Club, an exclusive Christ Church debating society, but he did not join the Oxford Union or the Oxford University Dramatic Society, for reasons of cost and time commitments respectively. His tutors for Honour Moderations were Denys Page and John G. Barrington-Ward, said to be \\"one of the best Latin prose scholars in Oxford\\", who was also a crossword setter for The Times. Chenevix-Trench twice narrowly failed to win the coveted Hertford Prize for classicists, but in Mods he achieved twelve alpha grades out of fourteen papers, resulting in an easy First-class in Latin and Greek literature. Before his third year at Oxford began, the Second World War broke out, and Chenevix-Trench signed up for the Royal Regiment of Artillery (believing it likely to be more cerebral than an infantry command)‚Äîhis oath was witnessed by Hugh Trevor-Roper. Military service 6-inch howitzers, which proved cumbersome in the thick jungle. Chenevix-Trench started his military career as an officer cadet at Aldershot, taking the technical and organisational teaching seriously but the remainder less so: \\"In these pre- Dunkirk days, work finished at five o'clock and everyone went home for the weekend.\\" On 1 March 1940, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. When volunteers were requested to be replacement officers for artillery units in India, he stepped forward, remembering his happy childhood days there. In Bombay, he joined the 22nd Mountain (Indian Artillery) Regiment, and took charge of an artillery battery. His linguistic skills were immensely valuable in overcoming poor communications within the unit (he mastered the basics of Urdu to make it possible for the officers to communicate with their men), though the culturally diverse nature of the unit, half Muslim and half Sikh but with British officers and signallers, continued to cause problems. 3.7-inch mountain howitzers when some of the 6-inch guns were captured by the Japanese during the chaotic retreat through Malaya. The regiment, made up of four batteries, was stationed in Singapore, the most important British naval base in the Far East. Each battery was made up of 180 men with four British officers; Chenevix-Trench's battery was the 24th (Hazara) Mountain Battery, which had recently been re-equipped with 6-inch howitzers. By the time Japan attacked Malaya in early December 1941, Chenevix-Trench had been promoted to battery captain, and the battery was hundreds of miles further north in Jitra near the Malayan border with Siam, supporting the 11th Indian Division in defence of the Alor Star airfield. They were soon forced to withdraw in the face of the Japanese offensive, and then became part of the general retreat southwards through Malaya as the British forces risked being outflanked by Japanese amphibious landings. Massive Japanese air superiority put an end to the British naval counter-strike by sinking the battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse, which had been sent to attack the Japanese transport ships. The battery commander, Edward Sawyer, described Chenevix- Trench as having been \\"a tower of strength\\" in the rearguard action. By 26 December, the unit was fighting at Kampar, halfway back to Singapore. Chenevix-Trench was further praised for his battery's role in defeating the first Japanese amphibious landings at Kuala Selangor, but the retreat continued, and by the end of January 1942 the regiment was back in Singapore, supporting the 28th Indian Infantry Brigade in its defence of a sector of the island's shore west of the causeway linking it to the mainland. The 85,000 British and Commonwealth troops in Singapore surrendered on 15 February. One of the Sikh artillerymen in Chenevix-Trench's unit was not much impressed by the physical appearance of the Japanese, asking, \\"Sahib, how came we to be beaten by those bastards?\\" The British surrender at Singapore was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history. Chenevix-Trench was a prisoner of war (POW) for three and a half years, first at Changi Prison and then working on the Burma Railway, where he lost an eye and suffered kidney failure.Philp, Robert (1998). A Keen Wind Blows. James & James. p.97. The twenty-four British officers and signallers were separated from their Indian troops ‚Äì whom the Japanese had hopes of subverting to their cause ‚Äì and initially lived in fairly tolerable conditions. Chenevix-Trench learned more about India's ethnic and political divisions, read Homer's Odyssey in Greek and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and compiled, bound and decorated an anthology of English poetry. Conditions changed in April 1943 when the POWs were used as slave labour on the railway. The track had to be forced through impenetrable jungle, in appalling conditions and with malaria, dysentery and beriberi constant: Chenevix-Trench suffered all three. Medical supplies were non-existent, rations at starvation level, and the sick forced to work until they died. Chenevix-Trench saved many lives through inspired pseudo-medical advice and hygiene discipline. He saw one of his fellow soldiers impaled against a tree with bayonets for attempting to escape, amidst many other horrors. When a cholera epidemic struck, the British did not have enough fuel to build funeral pyres for the victims, so were forced to bury them in shallow graves. Heavy rains came and washed away the soil from over the graves, and one morning Chenevix-Trench and his fellow prisoners emerged from their camp amidst rows of protruding bones clad with rotting flesh. Chenevix-Trench observed the huge celebrations of the local population when British forces liberated Singapore. Despite it all, he kept up his classical studies, remembering his fondness for Shrewsbury School by translating A Shropshire Lad into Latin, and gave talks to his fellow prisoners about Greek literature. He was also remembered as a man who took mortal risks to barter for the food that might keep men alive a few days longer. For his parents, almost all of 1942 passed without a word, before learning by an official telegram that he was a prisoner of war; they continued a constant stream of letters, most of which reached him and gave him great comfort, even though his postcards in the opposite direction were censored or injected with random text like \\"tell Susan not to worry\\". Susan was fictitious, but by 1944 she did indeed not need to worry about him; with the railway completed, he was back in Singapore, with enough leisure to learn both Persian and Mandarin, as well as \\"cooking, gardening, bridge and poker\\". Thus, with the added inconvenience of starvation rations once again, he lived out the rest of his war. Chenevix-Trench described how the population of Singapore was \\"crazy with joy and showed it\\" when British troops arrived to take back control of the city after the Japanese surrender. His brother Godfrey was serving as navigating officer on HMS Cleopatra, the first ship into Singapore, and the two were reunited the same day. Chenevix-Trench was also reunited with his Indian troops, and took the unusual decision that \\"after all my men have been through and their magnificant behaviour under shootings, beatings, and starving by enemy propagandists, I feel the least I can do to thank them is to see them all happily home to their villages\\". He therefore returned to England via India, only reaching home on 29 October 1945. Return to Oxford Chenevix-Trench returned to Oxford in 1946 to complete his degree. He was elected President of the Christ Church Junior Common Room towards the end of that year, was involved in reviving the college's Boat Club, and was \\"the life and soul of the gathering\\" at many social functions. He was taught by R. H. Dundas, Eric Gray, Gilbert Ryle, Jim Urmson and Maurice Foster. He won the prestigious Slade Exhibition in 1947, and then achieved the remarkable feat of gaining an alpha in every single paper in Greats. In his final year, he had done some classics teaching back at Shrewsbury School when several classics teachers fell ill, and his enjoyment of it decided him on teaching as a career, with plans to become a headmaster one day. With offers to teach at Christ Church, Eton and Shrewsbury, he eventually chose Shrewsbury, and began teaching classics there in January 1948. Teaching career =Shrewsbury and Oxford= At Shrewsbury Chenevix- Trench's philosophy was that he preferred that \\"the majority of boys kept the rules most of the time rather than one which stifled individual vitality\\". His lessons with the younger years also had a system of punishments and bribes: excellent work might receive a shilling or half crown reward at his own expense, while a major mistake in written work would be marked by a picture of a crab ‚Äì more than three crab images would result in the boy receiving corporal punishment in the privacy of Chenevix-Trench's study. With the older years he introduced textual criticism, philosophy and history to give greater insight into the classical texts than conventional teaching of the time allowed. He would also regularly tutor older boys individually ‚Äì with alcoholic refreshments on hand ‚Äì and occasionally permitted his proximity in age to encourage excess humour, as when he let slip to some of the sixth form that a visiting speaker, Reverend Hoskyns-Abrahall, had been known to Chenevix-Trench in his own schooldays as \\"Foreskin-rubberballs\\". Chenevix- Trench was involved in coaching rowing ‚Äì in which Shrewsbury School had a strong tradition ‚Äì both as assistant master and as housemaster. Chenevix- Trench also served as an officer in the school's Combined Cadet Force, as a coach for rowing crews, and as an organiser of \\"holiday camps for underprivileged children in Shrewsbury\\". On school ski trips to Switzerland he would make up for his lack of skill at the sport by instigating \\"ferocious snowball fights\\", and abusing his linguistic skills in talking to other skiers, \\"talking a kind of German to the French, which they then disliked, French to the Americans, which they didn't understand, and Urdu to the Swiss, who were more than puzzled.\\" In September 1948, he was promoted to the position of house tutor of School House, a role he relished as he took a keen interest in assisting boys with their academic work ‚Äì both by practical advice and by once again instituting a system of corporal punishment for specific numbers of errors ‚Äì and also in indulging the \\"juvenile tomfoolery\\" of his teenage charges. In 1950, Chenevix-Trench was persuaded to accept the position of tutor for Classical Honour Moderations back at Christ Church. He took up the position in October 1951, but, despite the importance of the post, and the persuasive arguments that only at Oxford could his academic talents truly shine, he found the undergraduates lacking in enthusiasm, and the life of an Oxford tutor to be more detached from his students than he preferred. In February 1952, George Turner, the headmaster of Charterhouse, who was about to retire, wrote to Chenevix-Trench insisting he apply for the job, and Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury and chairman of the Charterhouse governors, visited him in person to urge him to do so. Soon considered the favourite, despite pressure from Christ Church not to leave, Chenevix-Trench caused chaos by first submitting his candidacy, then withdrawing it after Tom Taylor, housemaster of School House back at Shrewsbury, died suddenly in the post and he was offered the job. Loyalty to his old school and house won out over both the remarkable opportunity of being headmaster of a major public school at age 32 and his academic responsibility at Christ Church, and Chenevix-Trench accepted the promotion at Shrewsbury, despite great distress at the conflict of loyalties. From Christ Church, Roy Harrod wrote that \\"There is something about the way this has been done that shocks me. I have a terribly strong sense that it is wrong\\". At Shrewsbury there was delight at his taking the job, and a \\"pandaemonium of excited and happy chattering\\" among the boys of School House when they were told. Chenevix-Trench took up his new post in September. In November 1952, Chenevix-Trench spoke with Michael Hoban in opposition to a motion at the school Debating Society, proposed by the old boys and then Oxford undergraduates Michael Heseltine and Julian Critchley, that \\"This House Deplores the Public School System\\". Both the proposers poked fun at Chenevix-Trench's proclivity towards corporal punishment, and he defended the practice by suggesting that the alternatives had their own problems. The motion was carried by 105 votes to 95, and the tabloid newspapers made a great story from the outcome. Chenevix-Trench did not change his approach, nor did he object to the continuation of the tradition of fagging, nor that of older boys having the right to use corporal punishment on younger boys. In addition to his added organisational responsibilities as housemaster, he also continued both his close academic tutoring and carefree informality with the boys of School House. On 15 August 1953 he married Elizabeth Spicer, a primary school teacher whose brother he had known at Oxford. She took over some of the organisational work in School House, resulting in reports from the boys of great improvements in the quality of the food. Elizabeth gave birth to twin daughters, Laura and Jo, in October 1955. The couple's two sons, Richard and Jonathan, were born after he left Shrewsbury. =Bradfield College= In January 1955, Chenevix-Trench agreed to be interviewed for the position of headmaster at Bradfield College, who were eager to find a younger replacement for John Hills, and were impressed by Chenevix-Trench's academic credentials. He got the job and left Shrewsbury with great regret. At Bradfield he continued his insistence on informality, regularly associating with the boys in their leisure time to relate his many anecdotes, and learning every boy's Christian name. He also abolished an ancient tradition whereby the entry of the headmaster to the most revered event (a play in ancient Greek performed once every three years) was heralded with a trumpet fanfare. He was successful in re-establishing close links with prep schools, which were vital for maintaining a flow of academically able boys to join the school and increase its numbers. He also charmed parents, of both existing and prospective pupils, lavishing great attention on them. As a disciplinarian he could be forgiving and open-minded: Richard Henriques was sent to him by the school chaplain to be punished for asking a controversial question about religion, but Chenevix-Trench dismissed the problem. Bradfield College's chapel hosted many inspired sermons by Chenevix-Trench, but also some occasions where his nerves, shattered by his wartime experiences, failed him. He relaxed some uniform rules, but maintained rules that he felt reinforced school spirit, such as boys being required to attend inter-school sports fixtures as spectators. As at Shrewsbury, he did not abolish fagging or the rights of older boys to beat younger boys, but at Bradfield he reduced both. Even after his minor reforms, new boys were still caned by prefects for \\"talking after lights out\\", \\"misbehaviour in the dining hall\\", \\"insolence to a prefect\\", and similar transgressions. The prefects themselves sometimes fell victim to Chenevix-Trench's harsher rules, though: he expelled the Head of School (head boy) for smoking on school transport after an official sports fixture. Other aspects of his approach were more controversial, even for the times. Chenevix-Trench's biographer, Mark Peel, stated that \\"although Tony's efforts to rid the school of homosexuality by engaging in a massive beating spree were seen by many as discrimination towards the non-robust boys, only the minority appears to have been alienated\\". His mixture of corporal punishment with close friendship continued, with some recipients of the cane offered an alcoholic drink immediately afterwards. In later years, Chenevix- Trench liked to tell how a pet mouse called Peter had a lucky escape when its diminutive owner, already bent over a chair in his study to be caned, suddenly realised that Peter ‚Äì the cause of the impending punishment ‚Äì was still in his back pocket, and politely asked Chenevix-Trench to hold the mouse until the caning was over. Finding the situation uproariously funny, he did not administer the punishment. He also threw himself into the task of fighting for his teaching staff, succeeding in increasing both pay and rights for housemasters, and recruited young graduates constantly to modernise the range of teachers. Despite his own enthusiasm for boxing, when one new recruit was put in charge of gym and expressed his opposition to the sport, key to the school at the time, Chenevix-Trench agreed with his arguments (which were backed by the school medical officer) and boxing was abolished in July 1963. Although he actively but respectfully involved himself in his housemasters' running of their houses, Bradfield also saw the first signs of real problems caused by his administrative or communicative carelessness: heads of departments could find new staff appointed under them without being informed, much less consulted; staff accommodation arrangements were sometimes random; and he found the important consideration of the school timetable arrangements to be completely outside his sense of priorities. Chenevix-Trench continued to teach while headmaster, and boys described his lessons as exhilarating. That, along with his determination to encourage his staff to follow his example, succeeded in substantially raising academic standards at Bradfield from their already relatively high level. Other triumphs included his use of his excellent rapport with the School Council to persuade them to increase scholarships for gifted but less pecunious boys, increase the numbers of teachers to support a wider curriculum, and approve a new complex of science buildings in March 1956. This was followed in March 1960 by the launch of an appeal fund that ultimately paid for central heating, new kitchens, new study bedrooms for the boys (whose accommodation had been criticised in a March 1959 report Chenevix-Trench requested from the Ministry of Education), and a music hall and language laboratory. Exam results soared, as did the number of boys gaining university places. Chenevix-Trench's public profile saw a corresponding rise; in 1958 he appeared on the popular BBC panel-format television programme The Brains Trust, broadcast on television during the peak time Sunday afternoon slot and then rebroadcast on Home Service radio the following day. Anthony Sampson, describing the headmasters of leading public schools in Anatomy of Britain in 1962, called Chenevix-Trench a \\"heroic and unusual man\\". He was the only headmaster appointed to the Committee on Higher Education which produced the Robbins Report that led to significant British university expansion in the late 20th century. He signed the Marlow Declaration on society and equality, and declined headmasterships at a host of top schools including Shrewsbury. On 4 March 1963 the BBC announced that he would be the new headmaster of Eton. =Eton College= Chenevix-Trench was uneasy amidst Eton's traditional grandeur, the aristocratic parents and the fiercely independent housemasters. After his appointment, the Daily Mail described him as \\"a practical, pragmatic teacher, who has it in his heart to inspire and transform our society through our children\\". As quoted in Peel 1996, p.4 Some other newspapers had similar praise, but more thoughtful commentators were not so sure. Chenevix-Trench himself earlier told a friend \\"Eton's too big for me, I'm not the right man. I like to be involved individually with boys.\\" His older brother said he should not take the job. From the outset, Chenevix-Trench did not get along easily with Harold Caccia, who held the uniquely influential position of provost at the school, and was unimpressed by Chenevix-Trench's administrative failings. Not being an old Etonian himself, he also struggled to find the proper way to deal with the aristocratic rank of many of the parents, and even felt intellectually eclipsed by some of the teachers, in contrast to Bradfield. The housemasters at Eton also had vastly more power and independence than at Bradfield, and Chenevix-Trench's interference with how they dealt with boys from their own houses now caused anger rather than just annoyance, as did his continuing blunders in promising the same promotion to more than one person. He ended up describing the housemasters as like medieval barons with swords half-drawn, and never mastered the subtleties of dealing with them effectively. Chenevix- Trench's time at Eton, in the midst of the 1960s, was further confused by the sense of change sweeping through the country. The Daily Express said that Eton \\"may well have elected a man who will help to effect a quiet, but most necessary revolution\\" at the school. As quoted in Peel, 1996, p.142 The Eton Chronicle, authored mostly by pupils, was more blunt about the expected upheavals of the times, writing about the new headmaster that, \\"The whole problem of privilege, and the question of integration with the state system of education will inevitably become a political issue arousing vehemence and bigotry\\". As quoted in Peel, 1996, p.149 As late as the final term of 1965 Chenevix-Trench, interviewed in the same publication, publicly expressed a preference for entry solely by competitive examination rather than by birth and background, and the same year he was still assuring pupils that school uniform was to be abolished entirely. The Chronicle was again a factor in the debate over abolishing boxing; David Jessel and William Waldegrave wrote a piece against it in February 1964, and the Daily Express featured it on its front page. Not all these demands seemed important or realistic to following generations, who also wondered how significant it was whether \\"to listen to high thoughts and to be at peace in school for ten minutes every day\\", in chapel, should be optional or not. The BBC reported in 1967 that Chenevix- Trench had \\"considerably softened\\" the rigorous rules on chapel attendance. Nevertheless, Private Eye duly ran an article in 1969 arguing that Chenevix- Trench had clearly lost his way, since neither school uniform, nor boxing, nor compulsory Chapel, had been entirely abolished. The Private Eye article also reported on Chenevix-Trench's approach to corporal punishment. It had always been traditional and frequent at Eton. Until he became headmaster, disobedient students could be publicly birched by the headmaster or lower master on their bare buttocks as punishment for serious offences. In addition, senior students at the school were permitted to cane other boys across the seat of the trousers, and this was routine.Cheetham, Anthony; Parfit, Derek (1964). Eton Microcosm. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. The Council at Bradfield, always hugely supportive of Chenevix-Trench, had never considered his use of corporal punishment a problem. But at Eton, the modern era of adolescent challenges to authority, combined with the existing tradition of powerful housemasters expecting to make their own decisions, quickly led to problems. In June 1965 Chenevix-Trench failed to prevent a debate proposed by William Waldegrave, then president of the powerful self-selected pupil society known as Pop, on the abolition of corporal punishment, and the motion was only narrowly defeated. Chenevix-Trench caned sixth-formers for trivial offences against the urgings of the Captain of the School (head boy); he caned one editor of the Eton Chronicle and backed down after threatening to cane another; and on a later occasion he agreed with the Captain of the School and his housemaster to punish an offender in a formally witnessed ceremony, but then gave a private caning instead without discussing it with them. The long history at Eton of birchings being public, and most canings being widely witnessed, meant that Chenevix-Trench's preference for private beatings was viewed with suspicion. In 1966 the Provost made him promise that he would no longer issue beatings in private. He did not keep the promise, thus storing up yet more distrust. To replace headmaster's birching, he introduced private caning, also administered to the bare posterior of the boy, who was required to lower his trousers and underpants and bend over in his office. A few boys resented this and felt that a caning over the trousers, as was standard practice at nearly all other schools by this time, would have sufficed.Onyeama, Dilibe (1972). Nigger at Eton. London: Leslie Frewin. Prince Henry) was the only successful part of his campaign to abolish school uniform at Eton altogether. Despite being so obviously out of his depth, he made some minor and some major reforms. He ended the uniform requirement of smaller boys being marked out by having to wear the much shorter \\"bumfreezer\\" Eton Suit, but this was a tiny consolation for the crushing of his cherished goal of ending school uniform at Eton altogether. His reforms of the academic curriculum were colossal, moving Eton from being dominated by classics and catering almost exclusively for boys who had been privately and expensively educated in that field, to a vastly broader curriculum including the establishment of an English department for the first time, as well as introducing proper science teaching. In typical Chenevix- Trench style, these changes were achieved through a lengthy process of vacillation, U-turns, and another half-lie to the provost ‚Äì massive expenditure was required to fund the new teachers, and even the Classics Department suffering worse than decimation (which contributed to the opposition to Chenevix-Trench) did not make up for it financially. But the consequence was that the school achieved a one-fifth increase in university awards, a \\"spectacular\\" increase in O-level and A-level grades, and improved university entrance results. The tumult of the era continued to faze Chenevix- Trench's tenuous hold on Eton; he adopted a drugs policy that saw him trudging up and down the High Street looking for offenders, and at the same time he declined to expel those caught indulging. With his antipathy toward school uniform, the fashions of longer hair and particular styles of boots did not bother him at all; some of Eton's housemasters were appalled by this lack of diligence. Boys who ran away were rewarded with long talks with the headmaster seeking to find the cause of their problems; traditionalists did not approve, wanting them beaten or expelled or both. Chenevix-Trench had always been shocked by the proportion of boys then at Eton who had absolutely no interest in doing any work, but some had the determination to continue to refuse even when threatened. If he had mastered his relations with housemasters, and understood how to run the school by delegation as it had always been run, this would have been no problem; but for a headmaster that already struggled even with the basics, it was too much. Chenevix-Trench's health, both physical and mental, also began to suffer, with the return of the malaria he had caught during the war, and flashbacks and nightmares of his wartime experiences. He took tranquilizers to help him with his worsening nerves when carrying out public speaking engagements, and resorted to heavy drinking to drown his other sorrows. The final straw came after a dispute over the future of one of the housemasters, Michael Neal. Neal was a popular and effective teacher but failed to keep proper control over his house. After a major incident in summer 1968, Chenevix-Trench declined to dismiss him, instead offering to resign himself. The offer was rejected, but Neal's house continued to be problematic, and Chenevix-Trench eventually had to fire him on the pretext of a much less serious incident several months later. He handled it badly, leading to protests by the boys, and this combined with a growing awareness of the other problems led the Fellows to decide to ask him to leave. This was dealt with sensitively; Chenevix-Trench himself wrote to parents in July 1969 to inform them that he would be retiring a year later. =Fettes College= Chenevix- Trench's enforced departure from Eton made him very dubious about his capability to take on another post as headmaster, but in May 1970 he applied to be headmaster of Fettes College in Scotland, and began the job in August 1971. The break between jobs, punctuated by a brief time filling in as a teacher at the prep school Swanbourne House and once again lecturing on a Swan Hellenic tour of Greece, allowed him to recover from the illness and tiredness that had begun to overwhelm him at Eton. Fettes was a school much more amenable to Chenevix-Trench's style of headmastership, with only around 400 pupils, and he quickly resumed the approach he had used at Bradfield, insisting that \\"my study door is always open to those who want to see me\\", and making great efforts to please the prep schools and prospective parents and pupils ‚Äì essential to increase enrolment to improve the parlous state of the school's finances. By January 1978 enrolment had reached 491 boys and 41 girls, in addition to the opening of an attached junior school for eighty boys aged 11 to 13. Chenevix-Trench declined to use the cane on female pupils, even though one girl demanded it ‚Äì for herself ‚Äì on grounds of gender equality. Fettes College was a school of a size better suited to Chenevix-Trench's personal style of leadership; when he arrived it had a tough and austere traditional atmosphere, which he worked to reform. Other reforms he instituted at Fettes included the abolition of personal fagging ‚Äì part of the tough traditional system at the school where prefects held considerable power. Mark Peel wrote that \\"the sight of a petrified third former shaking with fear outside the prefects' room before being exposed to some lurid initiation ritual wasn't unknown\\". For Chenevix-Trench, modernisation began by relaxing ancient rules; boys were allowed greater access to the adjacent city of Edinburgh, sixth formers were allowed to visit pubs on Saturday evenings, and the dress code was made less restrictive. Some staff were less than happy at the dress code changes; Chenevix-Trench \\"would roll his eyes to the heavens in boredom if someone deigned to raise the matter at a housemasters meeting\\". Chenevix-Trench also came under considerable pressure from the teachers over pay; they were significantly underpaid at the time and the school could not afford to pay them (or him) any better. His continued tendency to make promises of appointments that he could not deliver also caused problems again. Chenevix-Trench also continued his practice of administering corporal punishment in private; as the 1970s progressed, this was increasingly an anachronism when many schools were beginning to abandon caning. After complaints, its use in the school as a whole was discussed by the governors in December 1978, but their eventual conclusion was merely to require proper records to be kept, allow only the headmaster and housemasters to use corporal punishment, and to insist that it be specifically a last resort. By this time, despite having brought the school back from threatened bankruptcy and rejuvenated its fortunes entirely, Chenevix-Trench was once again starting to lose his grip on himself. His father had died in 1964, and his brothers Christopher and Richard in 1971 and 1977 respectively; he himself was increasingly a victim to fatigue, and also to intense regret at what he felt was his failure at Eton. He once again resorted to heavy drinking, trying unsuccessfully to conceal it from his wife. On numerous occasions he had to miss appointments due to drunkenness, and he also used corporal punishment on the wrong boy at least once. In February 1978 he was admitted to hospital suffering from a massive intestinal haemorrhage. He was soon well enough to leave hospital, but was pressured by the governors into announcing that he would retire in August 1979. He attended a series of events to mark his leaving, and in June 1979 he briefed his successor Cameron Cochrane on his hopes and plans for the school, telling his wife \\"I've handed my life's work over to Cochrane and I'm happy\\". Two days later he died during an emergency intestinal operation, aged sixty, before his term as headmaster had officially come to an end. Legacy Chenevix-Trench's biographer, Mark Peel, credits him with transforming Bradfield, building the early foundations for Eton's later rise to academic glory, and bringing Fettes back to being a popular, happy and successful school. Even when just appointed housemaster at Shrewsbury, Peel describes him as having been \\"already a legend\\". Not all of these conclusions were accepted wisdom; The Sunday Times viewed the dramatic Eton turnaround as entirely the work of later headmasters. As cited in Peel, 1996, p.192 Peel comments that Chenevix-Trench's intensive approach to tutoring, with corporal punishment an integral part of it if the pupil failed to live up to his potential, was something that most boys had no problem with, but that it generated lasting resentment for perhaps one in ten. Peel argued that for boys with non-conformist or politically radical tendencies, intense opposition to Chenevix-Trench was natural; in particular, that Paul Foot and Richard Ingrams were amongst those who revolutionised the school magazine at Shrewsbury, carried their wit from there to Private Eye, and carried their resentment with it. Tim Card's book Eton Renewed, published in 1994, finally made public the fact that Chenevix-Trench had not left Eton of his own accord. The press of the time were more than interested, fascinated by the idea that there might be some schools that still beat their pupils.Corporal punishment in private schools was finally abolished in England and Wales in 1999. Foot duly produced an article describing his own treatment when Chenevix-Trench was housemaster at Shrewsbury, and Nick Cohen summarised it in The Observer: This, along with similar comments in broadsheet newspapers of the time, provoked a furious backlash from other pupils of Chenevix-Trench, who set about proving Peel's \\"one in ten\\" rule. Christopher Hourmouzios reminisced to The Times: \\"He once flogged the living daylights out of me with a strap on my bare backside, and my brother tells me that the \\"headman\\", as we called Trench, once beat him and a whole divinity class of more than twenty boys one afternoon!\\" But, he went on: (he) \\"was the same man who abolished boxing at Bradfield, and later at Eton; who was a fine teacher who taught me Latin, just as he had his fellow PoWs after being captured by the Japanese in the Second World War; and who launched a modern, progressive appeal for new college buildings and facilities.\\"Hourmouzios, Christopher (29 April 1994). \\"Balancing the picture of Eton head\\" (Letter to the Editor). The Times (London). p.17. Nick Fraser, in his book The Importance of Being Eton: Inside the World's Most Powerful School, was much more blunt. Reviewing the book, The Sunday Times said that he \\"was subjected to a furtive sexual assault by the headmaster, Anthony Chenevix-Trench, whose proclivities in this area were not made public until after his death, and it damaged him, he says, 'more than I could ever have brought myself to express'\\". The Independent on Sunday reported in 1994: The Independent went on to say that the numerous letters to newspapers by former pupils showed a marked disparity between some who described Chenevix-Trench as \\"upright, justified, a fine educationist, a victim even\\", and others who recalled \\"a monster of depravity\\". Some former pupils who wrote in flatly denied some of the claims; Hume Shawcross, son of Lord Shawcross, one of the offspring of aristocracy whom Foot claimed mistreatment by Chenevix-Trench contributed to the latter's downfall, wrote that \\"I had relatively few dealings with Chenevix-Trench but I always found him fair and reasonable. In fact, I liked him.\\"Shawcross, Hume (September 1994). \\"Much maligned\\" (Letter to the Editor). The Daily Telegraph (London) He also recollected that Caspar Fleming, son of Ian Fleming, \\"was in no way unfairly treated by Chenevix- Trench and held no antagonism towards him\\", and opined that claims to the contrary were part of a \\"mean-minded vendetta\\".Shawcross, Hume (September 1994). \\"Old-school Feud?\\" (Letter to the Editor). The Daily Telegraph (London).

After 1948, it had to be rebuilt in the New City, on Rashi Street in the Ruhama neighbourhood of West Jerusalem. In 1974 though, a new yeshiva, soon to adopt the old name, was also opened in the Old City. The two now coexist. History of the Yeshivat HaMekubalim Entrance door to the Yeshivat haMekubalim, depicting all 7 gates in Jerusalem's Old City Walls Beit El on Rechov Rashi Headed notepaper of the Yeshiva depicting a photograph of Rabbi Meir Yehuda Getz : For the Religious Zionist Yeshiva in the yishuv of the same name, see Beit El Yeshiva, =1737-1927= The yeshiva was founded in 1737 by Rabbi Gedaliah Hayon, originally from Constantinople, for the study of kabbalah in the Holy City. In the 1740s, a gifted young man named Shalom Mizrachi Sharabi arrived in Jerusalem from Yemen. He studied at Beit El and over time became an outstanding scholar and kabbalist. At the behest of Rabbi Hayon, he was appointed head of the yeshiva.Where Heaven Touches Earth, by Rabbi Dovid Rossoff, Guardian Press, Jerusalem 1999. Under Sharabi‚Äôs leadership the yeshiva grew and became one of the main yeshivas in Jerusalem. Catering for roughly forty scholars, who were from both the Sephardic and Ashkenazi communities, these sages' only interest was to strive for higher levels of holiness and purity through the service of God. Rabbi Hayon had organized the life of the yeshiva around its prayer services, which through mystical communion with God would bring the scholars closer to understanding the secret teachings of Kabbalah. Rabbi Sharabi initiated regulations, orders and kawanot (\\"intentions\\") of the daily prayers according to the Nahar Shalom prayer book (Salonika, 1806/5566) which he authored, continuing the teachings of the famed Arizal and following its cosmological approach. While incorporating profound kabbalistic symbolism, entreaties and thoughts/meditations, his system provides all intent and purpose of the mechanisms of prayer. Known today as the Siddur haRashash, it stayed, together with the Etz \`Haim of Rabbi \`Haim Vital, at the center of all kabbalistic studies in the yeshiva. The scholars were divided into four groups. The first awoke at midnight to say Tikkun Hatzot and learn the Kabbalah of the Arizal until dawn. The second delved into the works of the Arizal from after shacharit (morning prayers) until midday. The third group learnt the Mishna with Rabbi Ovadia mi‚ÄôBartenura‚Äôs commentary from midday till nightfall. After ma‚Äôariv (evening prayers) the fourth set of scholars would arrive and learn the Talmud and the Shulchan Aruch.Sefer Chukei Chaim, by Rabbi Avraham Gagin. As the yeshiva's reputation spread throughout the Land of Israel and the Diaspora it attracted many prominent rabbis. Among them were rabbis Chaim Joseph David Azulai, Avraham Gershon of Kitov, Menachem Mendel of Shklov and Yom Tov Algazi. In 1757, Rabbi Sharabi chose twelve select disciples who were to form a special group called Ahavat Shalom (love of peace). They signed a pledge of eternal friendship which hung on the door of the Holy Ark in the synagogue. Part of the document reads: \\"..all twelve of us shall be as one glorious soul‚Ä¶that if God forbid one of us encounters misfortune, we will all assist him..\\" One of the stipulations was that if a son was born to one of the group, three members would go to learn Torah by the newborn's side every night until its circumcision to act as a safeguard for the child. On the night before the brit milah the whole group was instructed to visit and study there. The synagogue premises remained in the hands of the leading kabbalists of each generation who inherited the apartment on the top floor. In the late 1800s, the writings of Dr Eliezer Levy, who escorted Sir Moses Montefiore around Jerusalem, describe of how they visited the place where \\"they pray all year round according to the mystical meanings of the Arizal from midnight till the afternoon, and from then till the evening they study Talmud and Zohar.\\" The authoritative Sefer Etz \`Haim of Rabbi \`Haim Vital was for the first time printed under the auspices of the yeshiva around 1866. Distinguished scholars of Kabbalah continued to emigrate to Jerusalem in order to study in the yeshiva. Among the outstanding luminaries, Rabbi Hayim Shaul Dweck HaKohen, Rabbi Shaul Kassin (the father of the famed leader of Syrian Jewry, Rabbi Yaakov Kassin), and Rabbi Avraham Ades (the master of the Baba Sali) were drawn there from Syria in order to dedicate themselves to spiritual growth. =New building (1928)= The July 1927 Jericho earthquake damaged the building and the British Municipality ordered the building be demolished. No sooner had the order been received, plans got underway to rebuild and eight months later in March 1928 the new extended premises were completed. In the 1930s when the illustrious Chazon Ish was on his way to the Western Wall, he made a point of stopping by the synagogue to study there, stating ‚ÄúI have great merit to see the place where such great and holy people learnt and prayed‚Äù.Sefer Chibas Yerushalayim, by Rabbi Chaim Horowitz, Jerusalem 1964. During the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war the contents of the building were looted and the building was desecrated. =New City (after 1948) and Old City (after 1974)= The son of Rabbi Shalom Hedaya (who was head of Bet El from 1927 to 1945, following the leadership of Rabbi Yedidya Rafael Aboulafia and Rabbi Massoud Alhadad), Rabbi Ovadia Hedaya, set to work on schemes to revive the study of Kabbalah in the spirit of Bet El. Rabbi Ovadia Hedaya did so on the roof of his house on Rashi street before taking on the task in 1958 of rebuilding the yeshiva in the new section of the city on the very street where he lived. In 1974, six years after the liberation of the Jewish Quarter, on the very site of the former Beit El Synagogue in the Old City, the Beit El Yeshiva was re-established (at first under the cryptic name Rishpei Esh, as understood from the Shir haShirim) under the aegis of Rabbi Meir Yehuda Guez, a noted kabbalist, who until his death was the official rabbi of the Western Wall area. The Rashi Street yeshiva remains in existence. On 13 September 1995, a special ceremony took place celebrating the completion of refurbishment to the synagogue in the Old City, at this time it was also renamed Yeshivat HaMekubalim Beit El.Rav of the Kotel, by Simcah Raz, p. 455 It was originally scheduled to take place in early 1996, but Rabbi Guez perceived that it should be brought forward. Upon Rabbi Guez's death his foremost student (talmid muvhaq) was chosen as Rosh Yeshiva of the Old City site. One of the most famous alumni of the yeshiva was Rabbi Yitzchak Kaduri who died in January 2006. The Rosh Yeshiva Rabbi Shalom Mordekhai Haim Hedaya died in March 2010.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/136643 Rabbi Raphael Hedaya was appointed as caretaker Rosh Yeshiva of Beit El at the Rashi Street yeshiva until the year of mourning was passed. The current Rosh Yeshiva of Beit El in the Old City is Rabbi Yisrael Avi\`hai. Dispute over the reconstitution in the Old City Rabbi Ovadia Hedaya found himself in dispute with Rabbi Yehuda Getz over the rejection by the latter of Shemen Sasson (the primary work of Rabbi Sasson Farsiyado).Deah V'Haskel Part 7, 16:13, Authored by Rabbi Ovadia Hedaya, published Jerusalem 1979. The dispute led to the ultimate rejection of Rabbi Getz as a student of Rabbi Ovadia Hedaya.

The episode aired July 11, 2004 on the USA Network. The episode was written by Scott Peters and Ren√© Echevarria, and was directed by Yves Simoneau. Attracting approximately 7.4 million viewers, the episode became basic cable's most watched premi√®re since The Dead Zone. \\"Pilot\\" introduces the show's premise of 4400 people being abducted in the past, beginning from 1946, and all being returned to the present day in a flash of light at Highland Beach. A comet suddenly changes trajectory and is heading towards Earth, apparently coming in for a \\"landing\\", 4400 people assumed dead or missing reappear. When 4400s begin to exhibit \\"abilities\\" Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris are partnered to investigate them.  Plot  The episode begins on March 3, 1946. A young girl, Maia Rutledge (Conchita Campbell) of Crescent City, California, is with her parents in their car. Although it is raining outside, she persuades her parents to let her play nearby. While she is collecting flowers in the bushes, a light shines down on Maia, and she disappears. The next scene takes place on May 11, 1951 in South Korea. A young black soldier, Richard Tyler (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali), is being beaten by his fellow officers. One of them remarks, \\"We treated you like an equal, but that wasn't good enough for you. You had to cross the line.\\" A fellow soldier then drops a photo booth strip on the floor; the pictures are of Richard with a young white woman. Moments later, the same light which abducted Maia shines on Richard, and he vanishes. In 1979, Orson Bailey (Michael Moriarty), a partner at an insurance firm, is preparing to leave his office to take his wife on a date. As he approaches his car, the light appears and he vanishes as well. Next, teenage cousins Shawn Farrell (Patrick Flueger) and Kyle Baldwin (Chad Faust) are on a beach at night in the year 2001, drinking beers and talking about their personal lives. The light shines on them, and Kyle drops to the ground, alone and unconscious. The episode jumps to the present day with Kyle in a hospital bed, hooked up to a respirator. His father, Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch), is comforting him. Capilano Lake portrays Highland Beach Elsewhere, Diana Skouris (Jacqueline McKenzie) receives a call on her cell from Dennis Ryland (Peter Coyote) telling her to \\"Get over here, now!\\" As Diana arrives at NTAC, Ryland announces that the country is at DEFCON One. Diana asks to be brought up to speed, and an unnamed co-worker tells her that the comet is no longer a fly-by; it is heading toward the earth. Countries around the world begin deploying missiles in an attempt to destroy the comet. As it enters the atmosphere of Earth, Diana remarks that the comet is slowing down, \\"as if it's coming in for a landing.\\" As she tells Ryland the co-ordinates of where the comet's trajectory will land it, Dennis states that it is near Mount Rainier, their \\"back yard.\\" Arriving at the landing spot of the comet, a multitude of cameramen and reporters have set up. Diana looks on as the comet slowly comes in to land, hovering over a lake and causing ripples to form in the water. While emitting a sound, the comet begins to shrivel and lose its cohesion. Seconds later, the ball of light explodes, sending a shock- wave that knocks over the onlookers. Returning to their feet, they discover the comet is gone, and thousands of people have appeared. Back at NTAC, Tom and Dennis argue in Dennis' office. Tom tells him he needs answers, and that he will come through for Dennis. After this Dennis introduces Tom to Diana, explaining how, together, they will make a good team investigating the return of the 4400. The 4400 are quarantined at a Homeland Security facility where they are questioned. Tom meets with Shawn and questions him, expressing frustration when Shawn indicates that he does not remember anything. Orson becomes angry when inquiring about his release, causing a nose bleed. Richard meets Lily (Laura Allen), and finds out that she is the granddaughter of his former girlfriend, who has since died. The ACLU successfully sues for the release of the 4400. Homeland Security provides them with temporary living expenses, and many are reunited with family. Richard travels to St. Louis only to discover that his old neighborhood has been demolished and replaced with a highway. Orson visits his wife, who is now elderly and in a dilapidated nursing home, before visiting his insurance firm to get his old job back. The CEO is the son of Orson's former partner, and welcomes him back, but informs him that there are no available positions, and that his partnership was paid out to his wife when he was declared dead. Orson becomes visibly angry and smashes a glass in his hand. Later that night Orson takes a taxi to the CEO's house where he rings the buzzer at the gate and becomes agitated when it is not answered. He rattles the gate and yells, and as he becomes more agitated, glass shatters in the house and the CEO clutches his head before collapsing onto his coffee table where he is impaled through the chest with one of the legs. After her husband did not show up to pick her up, Lily goes to her old house. Her daughter, who was six months old when she disappeared, answers the door and does not recognize her. Her former husband comes to the door and informs her that he is remarried and that she would not fit in with his new family. She walks away stunned. Shawn returns home to a party. He and his brother are now the same age. He goes outside to catch a breather and Tom follows him. While outside a bird flies into the window and appears to die of a broken neck. Shawn picks up the bird, and while talking to Tom, the bird returns to life and flies away. At the end of the party, Shawn finds his car vandalized with the words \\"freak\\" spray-painted on it. Maia remains at the holding facility, having no living family. However, she understands this and acts calm. Eventually, she is adopted by foster parents. The foster parents take her home where they are startled by her seeming ability to predict the future. In the second half of the pilot, Maia's foster parents take her to visit the cemetery where her parents are buried. When they comment that the cemetery is not very well maintained, Maia tells them that they will be buried at a nicer cemetery. When they receive a brochure for the cemetery that Maia mentioned in the mail, they become shaken. They return her to the facility, which she understands. The mother warns her that she scares people by some of the things she says. Dennis attempts to question her on why she was returned, but she does not give him any specific answers, seeming to take her foster mother's warning to heart. Shawn returns to school where he struggles to fit in now that four years have passed. He is confronted by a boy to whom he sold fake concert tickets before his disappearance. After school, they get into a fist fight where Shawn appears to have superior physical strength and dexterity and seems to pull life from the boy. He is removed from the fight before serious damage is done, but the fight is witnessed by many people. His brother's girlfriend Nikki takes a special interest in his well being, providing him with comforting words and a burned CD of modern music that he can listen to in order to catch up with pop culture. Meanwhile, Tom and Diana are informed that Orson is being held by the Seattle police department in connection with the murder of the CEO. Seattle PD tell them that they cannot charge him, as the security footage clearly shows that he never went inside the house. However, Tom notices the glass flying in the footage. Tom and Diana question Orson, and he becomes slightly agitated. The room shakes, the coffee pots crack, and Orson's nose starts bleeding. However he realizes what is going on and calms down before anything serious happens. After not giving much information, he is released. He goes to the nursing home only to be informed that while he was being held, his wife died. He becomes angry, and the manager tries to restrain him. The building shakes, lights shatter and medical devices start flying around the room, with multiple nurses and orderlies witnessing. Orson then gets up and runs out. Tom and Diana visit the nursing home to get the details and warn the manager not to inform the press. They trace Orson to his lake cabin 70 miles away. They confront him there, and he asks to be left alone so he won't hurt anyone else. When they refuse, he again becomes agitated, causing the building to shake, objects to fly and nose and ear bleeds in himself, Diana and Tom. This time he can't seem to stop it, so Diana shoots him in the shoulder, at which point everything stops. He is taken to a hospital, but refuses to communicate any more. Lily meets with a doctor and finds out she is pregnant. She meets with her former husband who reminds her that he was out of town for an extended period of time around her disappearance, and says that the child could not be his. She states that she was never with anyone else. He also presents Lily with a restraining order commanding her to stay away from his family and their daughter. Distraught, Lily is next seen at a park. Meanwhile, Richard returns to Seattle and tracks her down. They embrace and decide to support each other, as the connection between Richard and Lily's grandmother has drawn them closer. Meanwhile, websites start popping up with conspiracies about the 4400, including one regarding Orson. Shawn walks in while his brother and his girlfriend are viewing this website. Shawn is also confronted by his brother regarding the fight, and claims he has no idea what he's talking about. However, he visits his cousin in the hospital and briefly wakes him from his coma by grabbing on to him, thus realizing that he has some sort of supernatural ability.  Production  Scott Peters, creator of The 4400, stated that The 4400 was loosely inspired by the events of 9/11. Originally \\"Pilot\\" was scripted to be a one-hour pilot for the FOX network; however, the FOX network passed on the show due to interest only in a miniseries while producer Maira Suro believed the show had \\"legs\\" for a full series. The FOX network then allowed Peters and American Zoetrope to \\"take\\" the show with them. The USA Network was approached with the series, and after reading the script, the show was greenlit for a two-hour pilot episode. According to Peters, the USA Network did not wish to change the show or cut any characters from the script. In an interview with writer and executive producer, Ira Steven Behr, he notes that there are no religious aspects to the episode and that he does not believe religion will play any major part in the first season, stating \\"I have my beliefs, and you have yours\\".  Reception  \\"Pilot\\" became basic cable's most watched premi√®re, supplanting the pilot episode of The Dead Zone. The episode was also nominated for two Emmy Awards in the 57th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special and the award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or Movie. The episode did not receive any awards. Sci Fi television critic Kathie Huddleston rated the episode as a \\"B\\", stating \\"The 4400 feels more like a drama than a science-fiction show.

The films featured an ensemble cast, with many of the actors appearing in successive films. The characters of the Five Lucky Stars were originally petty criminals recently out of prison, who started their own cleaning company. By the second film, the cleaning company idea was discarded, and the bumbling gang were instead employed to assist the police. The original trilogy The first three films were the most successful, directed by and starring Sammo Hung as one of the gang of Lucky Stars, and featuring supporting roles and cameos from a variety of Hong Kong film stars, notably his Peking Opera School \\"brothers\\", Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, as well as stars such as Andy Lau, Michelle Yeoh and Rosamund Kwan. The first film was Winners and Sinners (1983). The Chinese title, Five Lucky Stars, was chosen because it was evocative of the Seven Little Fortunes ( \\"The Lucky Seven\\"), the performance troupe at the Peking Opera School \\"The China Drama Academy\\". Hung got the idea for the plot from watching an old TV show, in which a group of police officers from different backgrounds worked together, each using their own particular skills. By giving the characters humorous and disparate backgrounds, he hoped to make an entertaining film. The original quintet of Lucky Stars in Winners and Sinners consisted of Sammo Hung, Richard Ng, Charlie Chin, Stanley Fung and John Shum. In the second film, My Lucky Stars (1985), Shum was replaced by Eric Tsang. In the third film, Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars (1985), Chin played a cameo wherein he handed over the reins to his Shaolin monk cousin, played by Michael Miu. Shum returned in a supporting role. The later films Lucky Stars Go Places (1986) was a departure from the original trilogy, with Hung giving up directing duties to Eric Tsang. Prior to joining the Lucky Stars crew, Tsang had directed the first two films in the Aces Go Places series - Aces Go Places (1982) and Aces Go Places 2 (1983). Like the Lucky Stars films, they were successful action comedies with an ensemble cast. However, the plots were parodies of James Bond films and characters fought with guns more often rather than kung fu. Lucky Stars Go Places was an attempt to combine the styles and characters of the two film series'. Hung remained involved, producing the film and playing a supporting role, and other members of the original Lucky Stars gang made cameo appearances. However, the main roles were taken by other actors, a new group of \\"Lucky Stars\\" - notably including Andy Lau and Alan Tam. With fewer action scenes and a heavier reliance on comedy, the film was significantly different from its predecessors. Stanley Fung co-directed the fifth film, Return of the Lucky Stars (1989), with Chu Shek-Tsan, and co-wrote it with Wong Jing. He also starred in the film alongside Richard Ng and Eric Tsang, as well as the returning Michael Miu. The 6th film, Ghost Punting (1992) was a comedy ghost film was directed by and starred Sammo Hung, along with Richard Ng, Stanley Fung, Charlie Chin and Eric Tsang. Although featuring all 5 of the Lucky Stars actors from My Lucky Stars, the emphasis is more on comedy than action. The final film, How to Meet the Lucky Stars (1996), saw the same four actors starring, although the film had a number of guest appearances, including Sammo Hung, Cheng Pei-pei, Chen Kuan Tai, Fran√ßoise Yip and Nora Miao. The film was released as a benefit film for the famous Hong Kong film director, Lo Wei, who died in 1996. In several cases, the Lucky Stars films were not true sequels of one another. Rather they had themes and actors in common. Stars came and went, though Richard Ng and Stanley Fung appeared in all seven films, whilst Sammo Hung and Eric Tsang appeared in six. Other actors returned in small roles to help boost the sales of the films, including the big names of Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao and Andy Lau. Additional actors in the series include Corey Yuen, Sibelle Hu, Mars, Sylvia Chang, Kent Cheng, Alan Tam, Dick Wei, Wu Ma, Yuen Wah and Bolo Yeung. The series consists of: *Winners and Sinners a.k.a. Intelligent Scheme Five Lucky Stars (1983) *My Lucky Stars a.k.a. Lucky Stars Superior Shine (1985) *Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars a.k.a. Summer Time Lucky Stars (1985) *Lucky Stars Go Places a.k.a.

Lucky Stars Ghost Encounter (1992) *How to Meet the Lucky Stars (1996) Spin-offs =Pom Pom= The Pom Pom series of Hong Kong comedy films is sometimes also included under the banner of \\"Lucky Stars films\\", primarily due to the series' sharing the stars, Richard Ng and John Shum. However the pair play official cops, rather than former criminals turned good. Sammo Hung worked as producer on the first three Pom Pom films, and as action director on the first two. All four films were released by Hung's production companies, Bo Ho Films and D&B; Films. In Pom Pom (1984), Hung, along with Charlie Chin and Stanley Fung cameoed as their characters from My Lucky Stars, which was released the following year. Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao also made cameo appearances (as a motorcycle cop and truck driver respectively), and a number of their Hong Kong action film contemporaries also made appearances, including Deanie Yip, Lam Ching Ying, Philip Chan, Dick Wei and Wu Ma. * Pom Pom (1984) * The Return of Pom Pom (1984) * Mr. Boo Meets Pom Pom (1985) * Pom Pom Strikes Back (1986) The Chinese title of Pom Pom (Á•ûÂãáÈõôÈüøÁÇÆ) translates as \\"Supernaturally brave artillery\\". The Chinese title of the 1986 Yuen Biao film Rosa (Á•ûÂãáÈõôÈüøÁÇÆÁ∫åÈõÜ) translates as \\"Supernaturally brave artillery sequel\\". Despite this, Rosa is not a sequel to Pom Pom. The 1992 Hong Kong action comedy film Pom Pom and Hot Hot starring Jacky Cheung and Stephen Tung is also not part of this series.

It lies in the council area of Perth and Kinross in the Coupar Angus and Meigle ward. The nearest town is Forfar in neighbouring Angus. Other smaller settlements nearby are Balkeerie, Kirkinch and Kinloch. Meigle is accessed from the north and south via the B954 road. In 1971 it had a population of 357.  Etymology  The name Meigle is of Pictish origin. Recorded as Migdele in the Legend of Saint Andrew, the first element is *mig, meaning \\"swamp, bog, quagmire\\", and the second is dol, \\"field, meadow\\" (c.f. Welsh mig-d√¥l). Area history The Pictish stones on display at Meigle are a manifestation of the rich early history of the area. The village of Eassie, approximately to the east of Meigle, is noted for the presence of the Eassie Stone, a carved Pictish stone dated to the Early Middle Ages. Attractions The Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum is housed in the former Victorian village school and contains an important collection of more than thirty Pictish Stones, along with some later carvings dating from between the 8th and 10th centuries, many of them superbly carved. The collection is one of the finest of its type in Western Europe. The village was probably the site of an important early medieval Pictish monastery, centred on the present church and churchyard. The collection is cared for by Historic Scotland and is open in summer. There is an entrance charge. Nearby Belmont Castle, constructed from the 15th century originally as a residence of the Bishops of Dunkeld, was the home of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1836‚Äì1908), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1905‚Äì08, who is buried in the village churchyard; a mural monument to his memory is built into the north-east wall of the church. Meigle is also home to Meigle C.C. a cricket team which competes in the Strathmore Union. Transportation Meigle railway station was a stop on the Alyth Railway, which served the village from 1861 to 1951.

On June 27, 1946, Bulgaria passed a law providing for the nationalisation of insurance companies and for a state monopoly on insurance business. Based on this law, all assets and liabilities of the existing public and cooperative insurance companies, mutual insurance funds, insurance departments of banks etc. are transferred to the State Insurance Institute (DZI). All valid insurances and portfolios, debts, as well as reinsurance contracts preserved their validity and were transferred by rights to DZI. By this act, effectively, DZI merged the active insurance companies into a bigger one. The state insurance control also ended its activity because the functions of the insurance control were transferred to DZI too. DZI was created by this law as an autonomous company, juridical entity, with headquarters in Sofia and with a complex structure, functioning in this way until 1952 when the establishment of branches and gradual decentralisation of the Institutes activity began. DZI functioned as the only insurance company in Bulgaria until 1961 when a government decree established the Bulgarian foreign insurance and reinsurance company ‚ÄúBulstrad,‚Äù founded on the then existing department within the DZI. The main shareholder in ‚ÄúBulstrad‚Äù was the Finance Ministry and one of the principal shareholders was DZI itself. ‚ÄúBulstrad‚Äù dealt with all insurance contracts related to obligations outside of the territory of the country ‚Äì marine, aviation, tourist etc., while DZI kept its monopoly over insurance business inside the country. Apart the monopoly on insurance, after 1946 the State gradually raised the relative share of compulsory (by law) insurance. The Law for Property insurance was voted in 1958 and the modifications of 1969 enlarged considerably the range of compulsory property insurance. The juridical monopoly on insurance has been kept strictly until 1989, when started real competition in insurance. Should be noticed, that although some of the names coincided, the newly created insurance companies were by no means successors of those existing before 1946. The rise of the new situation in the business was a challenge for DZI, which successfully transformed itself to market conditions and kept its pre-eminent position thanks to excellent performance and the offering of insurance products of the highest standard. Together with its business development, the Company has collaborated actively for the establishment of an appropriate insurance legislation and was among the co- founders of the Bulgarian insurers association in 1992. In October 1998 DZI was transformed into a public company with 100% state ownership. On 7 December 1999 in the ‚ÄúState Gazette‚Äù, issue 107 was published the decision of the Privatisation Agency to open a procedure for privatisation of the ‚ÄúState Insurance Institute ‚Äì DZI‚Äù Plc. which ended with the sale of the company on 27 August 2002 to Emil Kyulev‚Äôs ‚ÄúContract Sofia‚Äù Ltd. On 10 October 2002 at the shareholders‚Äô General Meeting was taken the decision to rename the ‚ÄúState Insurance Institute ‚Äì DZI‚Äù Plc. to ‚ÄúDZI‚Äù Plc. On 21 December 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired over 90% of DZI's banking division, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007. On 3 August 2007 KBC received all needed approval‚Äôs documents from regulations authorities and successfully finalised the acquisition of DZI with total amount of the acquired shares reaching 80,457%.

According to Pausanias the Lexicographer (Eust. ad Od. 20, 247, p. 1864), their name derives from their being inscribed on the cult image of Artemis in Ephesus. Clement of Alexandria considers them an invention of the Daktyloi. Similar to the mantras of Buddhism and Hinduism, they were \\"meaningless words\\" (·ºÑœÉŒ∑ŒºŒ± ·ΩÄŒΩœåŒºŒ±œÑŒ±) potent to protect those who could speak them correctly, their power residing in their sound, so that they were ineffective if mispronounced. Plutarch (Quaest. Conv. 706D) reports that the Magi instructed victims of demonic possession to recite the Ephesia Grammata. In the 4th century comedy Lyropoios by Anaxilas, one character carries Ephesia Grammata inscribed on his belt.Apud Athenaeus, Deipnosophistes 12:548c. The best known Ephesia Grammata are a group of six words: : (or ) :'''' A version of this formula seems to be attested by a damaged inscription from Himera, Sicily, which must date to before the Carthaginian destruction of the city in 409 BC. The next earliest epigraphic evidence for the formula comes from the 4th century BC, and it continues to re-appear on magical papyri throughout the Hellenistic period. The words sometimes occur in significantly different variants, for example on the lead tablet of Phalasarna, Crete: : :'''' There were various attempts by ancient authors to make sense of the words.

The regiment went overseas in July 1944 and saw service in the Middle East and Italy. There had been resistance from the War Office to form the West Indian regiment, but those who made their own way to the UK were able to enlist in the British Army. Nearly 10,000 West Indians travelled and joined the army in Britain. Following discussion between the Colonial Office and the War Office, the Caribbean Regiment was formed in April 1944 of 1,200 volunteers. The recruits were drawn from all over the British West Indies; most were members of local Volunteer Defence Forces. A few officers and non-commissioned Officers were also drafted in from British Army units. A detachment of 104 officers and men from the Atlantic island of Bermuda, made up of volunteers (conscription had been introduced to Bermuda shortly after the declaration of war, but those who were drafted to the Caribbean Regiment volunteered to do so) from the Bermuda Militia Artillery and Bermuda Militia Infantry, arrived on two ships on 13 and 23 April 1944 to form the training cadre of the new regiment at Fort Eustis, a US Army base near Williamsburg, Virginia. Under the command of Lt. Colonel H. Wilkin, OBE, MC, they prepared for the arrival of detachments from the West Indian islands, each under its own officers. Newly recruited men were tested in Virginia for fitness. With more experience, and a generally higher degree of education, many of the Bermudian men were made non-commissioned officers and distributed around the regiment. Some of the Caribbean soldiers had already trained for deployment to the Pacific. The Bermudians had previously trained for the war in Europe. The new regiment trained in Virginia, where the regiment was the first to celebrate the King's birthday in the U.S. since the American Revolution. The Regiment left the USA for Oran, in North Africa, in June 1944. Oran was handed over to Free French Forces before their arrival, and the Regiment went on to Italy in July 1944, where it was employed in general duties behind the front line. In October, it escorted 4,000 German prisoners of war from Italy to Egypt, where it was used in mine clearance work around the Suez Canal area. The regiment never saw front line action. This was due partly to inadequate training (with only a single battalion, it had not trained as part of a larger brigade; the smallest unit the British Army normally fielded on its own) and partly because of the anticipated political impact in the British West Indies if heavy casualties had been incurred. In 1946, it returned to the West Indies and was disbanded.

He was the highest decorated Jewish officer in the Free French, having been awarded the M√©daille militaire. Early life Weinberg was born in the small Westphalian town of Herford in Germany to a Jewish family. His father was an Iron Cross decorated veteran of the Great War, and the director of the family's local chocolate factory. In 1936, Weinberg's mother secured him the position of an apprentice in a knitting machine factory of a Jewish family in Stuttgart, where he gained experience in office administration. He enrolled in a course in textile engineering at a technical college in Reutlingen, to receive his engineering diploma in 1938. In September of that year, Weinberg was tipped off that he was about to be arrested by the Gestapo. He managed to avoid capture, quickly moving to Hamburg before leaving for Montevideo, Uruguay at the age of 19. World War II =In Montevideo= On December 1939, Weinberg became personally involved in the naval Battle of the River Plate. Omitting his Jewish background and passing as a regular German immigrant, he was approached by the British Embassy and given the mission to feed false information to the crew of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee that an overwhelming British force was being assembled, and that it was futile to attempt to leave Montevideo Bay. Being deceived by the false intelligence, the Graf Spee's captain, Hans Langsdorff, decided to scuttle the ship. =Free French service= Afterwards, Weinberg joined the Free French, where he was known by the name of Henri Rovey. He fought on several fronts, including the North African Campaign, under the command of Marie Pierre Koenig, and on the Gustav Line. In July 1943, he and others took arms captured from the Afrika Korps and gave them to the Haganah; he met with Moshe Dayan at this time. Weinberg also participated in several top secret missions for the Allies. The nature of several of these missions are considered top secret even today. Weinberg is considered by the Allies as a war hero, having received several high decorations from both British and French governments.

A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative back, he played his club football for Australian clubs the Canberra Raiders and Sydney Roosters, and for English club, the Leeds Rhinos. He was described as \\"one of the most exciting attacking weapons in rugby league.\\" Brett Mullins played in 209 first grade games during his 12-year career in Australia (183 for Canberra, 26 for the Roosters), during which he scored 105 tries for the Raiders and 17 for the Roosters and was equal second with Canberra teammate Jason Croker on the league's try scoring list in 1994 with 22 (Brisbane's Steve Renouf top scored with 23). He played 12 games for Leeds, scoring 4 tries. He played in 8 test matches for Australia (5 under ARL control, 3 for SL) between 1994 and 1997, though only his tests under the ARL banner are counted as official as the SL tests aren't recognised by the ARL. He scored 7 tries from his 8 tests. He also played 7 games for New South Wales between 1994 and 1997, scoring 7 tries. His father, William \\"Bill\\" Mullins was an Australian representative who played 190 first grade games for Eastern Suburbs Roosters, and his uncle's Russell and Terry Mullins played for Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Brett's son Bradley Mullins has recently signed with the Sydney Roosters, and is currently in their Holden Cup squad. Club career =Canberra Raiders= Brett Mullins made his first grade d√©but for Canberra from the substitution bench in a 48‚Äì0 rout of the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1990. He was recruited by Canberra from the Young Cherrypickers where he played as a junior. Mullins played on the wing, in the centres and also filled in at fullback during 1991, but an injury suffered in the Minor Preliminary Semi-final against Western Suburbs saw him miss a place in the Raiders Grand Final side that went down 12-19 to the Penrith Panthers. Mullins continued playing in the three-quarters before securing the Raiders fullback spot following the retirement of Gary Belcher at the end of the 1993. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Mullins overcame several niggling injuries to play in the Raiders 36‚Äì12 victory over the Canterbury Bulldogs. That season he finished with a total of 22 tries, which included back to back games against the Illawarra Steelers, and the Newcastle Knights where he scored four tries in each game. His end of season total of 22 tries equalled Noa Nadruku's club record and created the record for a fullback in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership (since equalled by Manly-Warringah fullback Brett Stewart in 2008). During the Super League war which began in early 1995, Mullins remained loyal to the Super League aligned Raiders. Although he had risen to be the game's #1 fullback in 1994, between 1995 and 2000 he would alternate playing at fullback, centre or wing for the Raiders. Tall (6'3\\" or 190 cm) with a long stride, Mullins was known for his pace, though he would later state that \\"I wasn't really that quick. Over 40 metres or 50 metres I guess I was, but I wasn't over 100. I think I used to drink and smoke too much. There's no doubting I had a good time.\\" In 2000, in his final year with the club, Mullins emulated his father by surpassing the 100 try scoring mark in first grade rugby league. After his on-field altercation with his teammate Mark McLinden against Parramatta, where he abused and pushed his team-mate, Mullins was dropped from the squad by team coach and former teammate Mal Meninga, and fined $25,000 dollars. =Leeds Rhinos= Following his sacking from the Raiders, Mullins signed with English Super League team Leeds Rhinos. He played 12 games for the Rhinos in 2001 (4 of them Challenge Cup ties), scoring 4 tries.Brett Mullins - Leeds Rhinos at Rugby League Project =Sydney Roosters= Mullins returned to Australia for the 2002 NRL season having signed with the Sydney Roosters (his father's former team when known as Eastern Suburbs) under the coaching of former Canberra, New South Wales and Australian teammate Ricky Stuart. In his final season before retiring, Mullins played 26 games for the Roosters (mostly on the wing) and scored 17 tries to take his tally to 122 tries from 209 premiership matches in Australia. His final season was a triumph as the Roosters won the 2002 NRL Grand Final, defeating the New Zealand Warriors 30‚Äì8 at Telstra Stadium in front of 80,130 fans. It was the club's first premiership since 1975, and saw him join his father as a premiership winner with the club (coincidentally, Bill Mullins had also played on the wing for the Roosters).2002 NRL Grand Final at Rugby League Project Representative career Brett Mullins made his senior representative d√©but for NSW Country in the annual City vs Country Origin game played at the Sydney Football Stadium on 24 April 1992. He would play 4 games for Country until 1996.Brett Mullins Country Origin games at Rugby League Project Mullins made his State of Origin d√©but on the wing for New South Wales in Game 2 of the 1994 State of Origin series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of a then record rugby league attendance in Australia of 87,161. He would go on to represent NSW in 5 Origin games between 1994 and 1996 and twice under the Super League banner in 1997. Despite playing on the wing for New South Wales in their 2-1 Origin series win over Queensland in 1994 (and despite the good form of incumbent Blues fullback Tim Brasher), Mullins made his test d√©but at fullback for Australia in a one-off Test against France on 6 July 1994 at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney, scoring a try in the Kangaroos record 58‚Äì0 win.1994 Australia vs France at Rugby League Project At the end of the 1994 season, he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour, playing fullback in all four tests on tour. Mullins played in 13 games on tour (once as a replacement) and was the 3rd leading try scorer with 11 behind only Andrew Ettingshausen (15) and Steve Renouf (12). The trio were the only players to reach a double figure of tries scored on the tour. In 1995 during the Super League war, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) refused to select players who were aligned with Super League for representative games. This saw Mullins miss selection for both NSW and Australia in 1995. Towards the end of the year Mullins, along with fellow Canberra test players Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Steve Walters and Bradley Clyde took the ARL to court in order to be ruled eligible for selection at the 1995 Rugby League World Cup to be played in the United Kingdom. The players won their court case, though it came as no surprise when only ARL loyal players were selected for the Australian World Cup squad. Following the 1997 Super League season, Mullins was selected to play from the bench for the Australian Super League team against New Zealand in a one-off test at the North Harbour Stadium in Auckland with the Kiwis providing a shock 30‚Äì12 win.1997 NZ vs AUS at Rugby League Project He was then selected in two matches of the Super League Test series against Great Britain. He played on the wing and scored 2 tries in Australia's 38-14 first test win over Great Britain at Wembley Stadium, and in the centres during the 20-12 second test loss at Old Trafford. Injury would keep him from Australia's 37‚Äì20 win in the third test at Elland Road in Leeds. The test at Old Trafford would prove to be his final representative appearance.

He began his career with the Balmain Tigers, where he played the majority of his career. He then moved to the South Sydney Rabbitohs for two seasons, before finishing his career with a season at the North Queensland Cowboys. During his career he also represented New South Wales on 21 occasions and Australia on 16 occasions. Balmain While attending Grantham High School in Seven Hills in Sydney, Brasher played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1988. In 1989 Balmain Tigers coach Warren Ryan called up Brasher, still in high school, to make his first grade debut. Balmain reached the Grand Final that year, Brasher played in the centres, but they lost to the Canberra Raiders 19‚Äì14. During the 1992 season, Brasher played most of the season on the wing, and he was the joint top try-scorer in the premiership (along with Wests' Mark Bell) with 16 tries. In the post season he was selected at fullback in Australia's 1992 Rugby League World Cup Final victory over Great Britain in front of the world record attendance for an international rugby league match of 73,631 at Wembley Stadium.1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project At the end of the 1994 NSWRL season, he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour. This was followed with selection for the 1995 World Cup, with again only ARL players selected. After losing the opening game of the tournament against England at Wembley, Australia reached the final, again playing England, after a 30-20 Semi-final win over New Zealand that went into overtime after the scores were locked up at 20-all after 80 minutes. On 28 October 1995 at Wembley Stadium, Australia won their 4th straight World Cup with a 16‚Äì8 win, with Brasher contributing the winning try in front of 66,540 fans.1995 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project 1996 however was perhaps Brasher's finest year. Some considered him to be the best player in the world at this time. Brasher single-handedly carried a very weak Tigers side to within one win of a finals berth that year, and his Origin and Kangaroo performances continued to be exceptional. After the Super League had become defunct and the reunification of the game had occurred in 1998, Brasher's hesitation over his future with the Tigers resulted in the club terminating negotiations, and he was forced to find a new club. He knocked back an offer of $500,000 p.a., only to then change his mind but find that the offer had been withdrawn not long after the dead line. SBFs Podcast: Stories With Tim Brasher Brasher was in talks with the Canberra Raiders, but after talks with the club stalled, it was announced that Brasher had signed for the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Brasher enjoyed a very successful career with the Tigers playing in 185 games, which included 182 starts and 3 replacement appearances, and scoring 538 points, which included 82 tries and 105 goals. Brasher was named on the bench in the official Balmain Tigers Team of the Century. South Sydney In total he played two seasons for the Rabbitohs where he made 40 appearances and scored 14 tries, totaling 56 points. After the club was excluded from the 2000 season, Brasher was forced to find another club, and decided join the North Queensland Cowboys. North Queensland Brasher moved to the North Queensland Cowboys in 2000, and was appointed captain in his first season with the club, in which he made 16 appearances, scoring four tries, and being voted Players Player of the Year. However, after the 2000 season had ended he was injured during the off-season, which ruled him out of the entire 2001 season. The career-ending injury was widely reported at the time as a knee injury as a result of Brasher falling from a chair cleaning a fan. However, it has since been discovered that the injury was the result of an accident that occurred during a trail biking adventure with former Cowboy's halfback Nathan Fien. Much speculation still exists as to why the Cowboys chose to conceal the events of Brasher's injury. He decided to retire due to the injury. Brasher did however make a very brief comeback (albeit to English Rugby Union) when he filled in for a depleted Bath side during the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Due to the attention that the World Cup drew in Australia, little attention was paid to this aspect of Brasher's career. Representative career =New South Wales= In 1992, he was called up for the New South Wales State of Origin squad. His impressive display in the second half of the third and deciding game of the series saw him pull off two try saving tackles on Mark Coyne and Mal Meninga, as well as kicking two goals. In the 1993‚Äì94 season, he was again called up to the New South Wales squad. After moving to South Sydney, his impressive form in a struggling Rabbitohs squad again earned him a call-up to the State of Origin side in 1998. After signing for the North Queensland Cowboys, Brasher was again selected for the New South Wales side in 2000. In all he represented New South Wales in 21 appearances, which included 20 starts and one replacement appearance. In his 21 appearances he scored three tries and nine goals, with a total of 30 points. =Australia= After his impressive State of Origin performance, as well as being the 1992 seasons leading try scorer for Balmain (while playing on the wing), Brasher was selected as the Australian fullback in their 1992 World Cup Final victory over Great Britain in front of the world record attendance for an international rugby league match of 73,631 at Wembley Stadium. Brasher beat out Newcastle Knights fullback Brad Godden for the vacant Australian fullback spot on the back of impressive big game displays in both the final State of Origin game that year, as well as with Balmain as an 18 year old in the 1989 Grand Final. Brasher, who had been moved to fullback at Balmain following Garry Jack's departure from the club, again impressed at fullback for NSW 1993, but lost his place in the Australian side to Queensland fullback Dale Shearer (a long- time favorite of Australian coach Bob Fulton) for the three game test series against New Zealand. Shearer's place in the Australian side wasn't disputed though after impressive displays for Qld in the final two games of the Origin series. The great form of Canberra fullback Brett Mullins meant that Brasher, who again played fullback for NSW in the 1994 Origin series, could only make a place on the bench for his test debut against France at Parramatta Stadium in 1994, won 58-0 by the Kangaroos. At the end of the 1994 season he was selected as one of the fullbacks (along with Mullins) for the end of season Kangaroo Tour. Brasher played 15 games on tour (six as a substitute), scoring six tries and kicking eleven goals. Brasher was a substitute in the final Ashes test against Great Britain at Elland Road in Leeds, as well as the test 74-0 win against France in B√©ziers, the final game of the tour. In 1995, Brasher finally made the Australian fullback spot his own and he was selected there for all three tests against New Zealand in the Trans-Tasman Test series (only ARL loyal players were selected, which saw only three players, Brasher, Brad Fittler and Rod Wishart retain their places from the 1994 Kangaroo Tour). This was followed with selection for the 1995 World Cup, with again only ARL players selected. With what many would label a 'second-string' team without the inclusion of the Super League players such as Laurie Daley, Bradley Clyde, Allan Langer and Glenn Lazarus. After losing the opening game of the tournament against England at Wembley, Australia reached the final, again playing England, after a tense 30-20 Semi-final win over New Zealand that went into overtime after the scores were locked up at 20-all after 80 minutes. On 28 October 1995 at Wembley Stadium, Australia won their 4th straight World Cup with a 16‚Äì8 win, with Brasher contributing the winning try in front of 66,540 fans. Between 1996 and 1998, Brasher was selected a further five times, against Fiji, Papua New Guinea (both 1996), Rest of the World (1997) and two Tests against New Zealand (1998). In total he represented his country on 16 occasions, scoring nine tries, totaling to 36 points.

The Corps contains clerks, operator supplies (including q-store staff, warehouse staff and food technicians), petroleum operators, parachute riggers and ammunition technicians. Members of the Corps are nicknamed Roaches. Unlike other Corps within the Australian Army, there are no longer any RAAOC specific units, instead RAAOC sub-units sit within mixed units such as Combat Service Support Battalions (CSSBs) or Force Support Battalions (FSBs). RAAOC is also responsible for clerks and quartermaster store staff in all Australian Army Units. The motto of the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps is 'sua tela tonanti' (commonly translated to 'to the warrior his arms'), taken from the mother corps, RAOC.  History  The Corps traces its history back to federation where General Edward Hutton started the Australian Army Ordnance Corps. The Corps gained its Royal prefix for its work during the Second World War. The RAAOC motto translates from Latin to 'To the warrior his arms, to the thunderer his thunder bolts'. The RAAOC badge is copied from the Board of Ordnance in the United Kingdom. On 31 May 1973 the Royal Australian Army Service Corps ceased to exist and the responsibilities of road, transport, air dispatch and postal functions were handed over to the Royal Australian Corps of Transport (RACT) who were formed on 1 June 1973. The responsibilities of provision of foodstuffs and POL (petrol oil lubricants) was handed over to the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps (RAAOC). Structure Members of the ordnance corps will be found serving in most Army units and headquarters. The primary Regular Army units manned by RAAOC soldiers are: 1 FLD Supply company relocated from Holsworthy to Darwin during the push for Australian forces to go north. They became 1 BASB. Base administrative support battalion. They were located on the old SES site in Winellie road. =Combat Service Support units= * Supply Company 1 Combat Service Support Battalion (Darwin), * Supply Company 3 Combat Service Support Battalion (Townsville), * 6 Field Supply Company, 7 Combat Service Support Battalion, Enoggera (Brisbane). =Force-level units= * 2 Field Supply Company (FSC) as part of 10 Force Support Battalion (Townsville) * 37 FSC as part of 9 Force Support Battalion (Ipswich). * 1 Petrol Company (Reserve) as part of 2 Force Support Battalion (Melbourne) * 6 Supply Platoon (Reserve) as part of 2 Force Support Battalion (Hobart) However, many Regular Army RAAOC trades are posted to units of all Regular and Reserve units throughout the Australian Defence Force as clerks, storemen(-persons) and other administrative and support roles. =RAAOC BOSCs= The Army Reserve element of the Corps used to also consist primarily of Supply Companies, with 4, 5, 8, 11, 13 Supply Company of each Combat Service Support Battalion (CSSB) of the respective numbered Brigades in each state. As part of Project FOCUS (Project Director Colonel Allan A Murray), these supply companies have been replaced by Brigade Operations Support Companies (BOSCs) in each Reserve Brigade. This implementation has centralised supply support to Army Reserve units, and as such, has been witness to a change of trade for Army Reserve members from warehousing (as in the old reserve Supply Companies) to Q-store streams. CSSB still exist in the Reserve Brigade, the BOSC replaces Admin Company, Supply Company and Catering Company. The BOSC is Controlled by the CO of the CSSB of that Brigade. Some positions will be replaced by APS, other positions won't be replaced once ARA staff are posted out in the future. The old Supply Companies will make a limited return, but the APS civies will run them as Brigade Operational Support Company (BOSC). The CSSB will have their own Q store manned by ARes members. RAAOC Trades =Supply Coordinator= The Supply Coordinator (also known as \\"Storeman\\", \\"OP SUP\\", \\"Yardies\\" or \\"Queeies\\"), formerly Operator Supply - can be employed as Unit Q-store staff or in Warehousing - also has sub- specialities: Food Inspector, MILIS system managers, etc. Broadly speaking it is divided into Operator Unit Supply (Quieees) and Operator Supply Chain (Yardies). The OP SUP is a soldier who has knowledge of the defence supply chain, and under supervision, has a key role in the provision of logistic Supply support within the formation. The OP SUP is a multi skilled soldier, and conducts duties relating to Supply support, Supply systems and unit Supply. The range of tasks includes inventory control, warehousing and distribution, Supply management processes, operator equipment maintenance and specialised packaging tasks related to dangerous goods. The OP SUP is required to drive and maintain a variety of Army vehicles and operate Mechanical Handling Equipment. The OP SUP may be required to operate in combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support roles. An OP SUP is to undertake the demand, receipt, storage, security, maintenance, inspection, internal issue, accounting for and disposal of all types of equipment and stores for, or held by the unit. OP SUP may be recruited or selected for the additional AMMO SUP course and specialise in ammo supply (see AT/ATO trade details below). =Operator Administration= The Operator Administration (also known as an OP ADMIN or \\"Clerk\\") conducts General administrative roles e.g. filing, typing and records. The OP ADMIN is a soldier who is responsible for the provision of first line personnel management support and resource management to units and members of the Australia Defence Organisation. The OP ADMIN has the skill sets to fill the role of Resource Manager or Career Manager and may also be employed within the training environment as an Instructor, Assessor, Trade Manager or Training Developer. As an OP ADMIN progresses through the trade and ranks, they gain a great deal of useful administrative skills including personnel management, public administration, financial management and concepts of government procedures. =Rigger Parachute= The Rigger Parachute Rigger (also known as RIGGER) is qualified to pack, repair and maintain parachutes and associated equipment for personnel, cargo and helicopter lift equipment for the Army. All Parachute Riggers are to be Basic Parachute Course qualified and as a Corporal are to be free fall qualified. The Rigger Parachute is a soldier who performs a wide range of technical functions on Aerial Delivery Equipment (ADE) including personnel and cargo inspection, repack, repair, modification, malfunction analysis, sentencing, procurement and fleet management of ADE. =Petroleum Operator= The Petroleum Operator (also known as a PET OP or OP PETRL) organise bulk fuel shipping and storage (tankers, big rubber bladders etc.). The OP PETRL is a soldier who is responsible for the deployment, construction, operation and maintenance of a range of petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) storage and handling facilities. The function of an OP PETRL is to operate and manage POL equipment and products. This includes the operation of field and static POL equipment, the laboratory testing and analysis of POL products, and the storage, packaging and disposal of Dangerous Goods (DG), include hazardous materials, but excluding DG Class 1 (Ammunition and Explosives). =Ammunition Technical Officer/Ammunition Technician= The Ammunition Technical Officer (ATO) and Ammunition Technician (AT or TECH AMMO) are involved with ammunition and explosives repair, storage, maintenance and disposal (EOD) and (IEDD) An ATO is a Commissioned Officer and an AT is a soldier who are ammunition and explosives specialists with the principal role of providing ammunition safety and performance assurance to commanders. They provide technical advice, technical support and management functions relating to ammunition and explosives to commanders, staff and other organisations at all levels. Through detailed knowledge of ammunition design and explosives engineering, the responsibilities and an ATO and an AT encompass all aspects of construction, function, use, storage, distribution, transportation, inspection, repair, maintenance, disposal and accounting of ammunition and explosives, including the operation of related equipment and facilities. An ATO and an AT also undertakes specific tasks for military and civil authorities by the provision of support for the identification and disposal of un-exploded ordnance (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDD). ATOs and ATs are trained at the Australian Army School of Ordnance. ATOs and ATs may also be selected for advanced EOD and IEDD training in the UK, USA and Canada. =Ammunition Supplier= The Ammunition Supplier (Ammo Sup) is an OP SUP soldier specialising in and responsible for ammunition supply and accounting within units across the entire Army. An ammunition supply specialist performs a range of duties from stores accounting, electronic ledger entry, to warehousing duties including receiving and issuing ammunition. As Ammo Sup progress, they have the opportunity to become an Ammunition Technician.http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/army/jobs/AmmunitionSupplier/ =Conductors= One Conductor appointment per RAAOC trade was reintroduced into the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps for selected Warrant Officers Class 1 in 2006. A conductor is considered to be senior WO1. Customs and Traditions = Colours = The colours of the Ordnance Corps are scarlet, in reference to their link with the combat Corps, and royal blue. Unit colour patches consist of a large scarlet square on a dark blue background, with a dark blue geometric shape in the middle. =Motto= In 1928 the British War Office in London gave approval for the then AAOC to adopt the same motto as the British RAOC taken from the Ancient Board of Ordnance being the Latin phrase SUA TELA TONANT! (Normally translated to as 'To the warrior his arms'). =Sovereign's Banner= The RAAOC Colonel-in-Chief, Her Majesty The Queen bestowed a Sovereign's Banner on the RAAOC. The Governor General of Australia Sir Zelman Cowen presented this banner to RAAOC at a parade held at Bandiana on 4 December 1981. =The Corps Badge= The RAAOC badge design was developed from the badge of the now disbanded British RAOC and consists of four elements: the Crown, Garter, Riband and Shield. The shield depicts three field cannons and three cannonballs and forms part of the Coat of Arms granted to the Board of Ordnance in 1823. The motto of the Order of the Garter 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' is inscribed on the Garter. The motto can be translated from middle French as either 'Evil to he who evil thinks' or similarly 'shame upon him who evil thinks'.Order of the Garter  Training  RAAOC training and Corps HQ is based at Army Logistic Training Centre (ALTC) at Bandiana in rural Victoria. The length of training for soldiers of the Ordnance Corps varies between 5 weeks for an administrative clerk, to the 18 Month Ammunition Technical Officer course. To train as an ammunition technician, a member must have a minimum of three years service and have achieved the rank of corporal.

The role of the law costs draftsman centres on a procedure known as the detailed assessment of costs, which is controlled by statute in England and Wales. They are concerned with costs relating to all areas of the law and deal with every conceivable type of legal matter that touches upon the subject of costs. An experienced and competent law costs professional may command a salary on a par with that of a solicitor or legal executive.  Main roles  = Inter partes costs = The unsuccessful litigant is usually ordered to pay the successful litigant‚Äôs costs (inter partes costs) and, if those costs cannot be agreed, a detailed bill of costs is prepared and served. The paying party then has to serve a schedule of points of those items in the bill he wishes to dispute before the bill is lodged at court and a detailed assessment hearing takes place at which the points are argued and a decision made by the court. A law costs draftsman can be involved in all the necessary procedural steps for either party and can also be involved in preparing case budgets. = Solicitor's fees = Solicitor's fees are costs payable by a client to his own solicitor. Different rules apply to the costs where court proceedings have been commenced, known as contentious business, to those applicable to non-contentious matters such as conveyancing, probate and general advice. A client who is unhappy with his solicitor‚Äôs bill has remedies available if he wishes to challenge it. If either the client or the solicitor is dissatisfied with the outcome of that request or if the bill relates to contentious business, either the client or the solicitor may apply to the court for the bill to be assessed. A law costs draftsman may be instructed to prepare a detailed bill of costs for assessment, to advise on law and procedure and, subsequently, if instructed by a solicitor or a litigant, to argue in support or to oppose the bill. = Legal aid costs = Where a solicitor is representing a publicly funded client, a detailed bill is usually required to be assessed either by the court or the Legal Aid Agency before payment can be made out of the community legal fund to the solicitor. Whilst such bills are usually assessed without any formal hearing, if an amount has been disallowed in respect of which the solicitor wishes to object, an appointment can be obtained and the matter argued at a hearing. In criminal cases, the objections to an amount disallowed are usually made in writing and, often, a law costs draftsman will be instructed to prepare the written submissions. Where a case is publicly funded, costs must be assessed and approved before the legal aid can be paid to the solicitor representing the legal aid client. If the total amount claimed is less than ¬£2500 then a CLAIM 1 form is prepared by the costs draftsman and assessed by the Legal Aid Agency. Where costs exceed ¬£2500 a bill of costs, similar in format to that prepared for detailed assessment of inter partes costs, is prepared and this is assessed by the Court before being paid by the Agency.  Legal status  The requirement to attend court to oppose or support a bill of costs may arise in any of the above three categories. Members of the Association who are qualified as costs lawyers have a right of audience and are entitled to appear as an advocate in relation to disputes as to costs. In addition under the Civil Procedure Rules 1999, a Fellow of the Association may be instructed as an expert by a litigant in person to advise on aspects of costs law and the litigant may recover any reasonable fees thereby incurred if he is awarded costs in his favour. Higher value matters are generally referred to Regional Costs Judges. Claims based in London are referred to the Senior Courts Costs Office (previously named the Supreme Court Costs Office). Law costs draftsmen must be skilled in the application of the statutory law relating to legal costs, and be familiar with the system of legal fees. For this reason, many firms of litigation solicitors retain law costs draftsmen as employees. Others rely on the services of dedicated costs drafting organisations and independent draftsmen. Since 1 January 2007, by virtue of the Association of Law Costs Draftsmen Order 2006, the ALCD has been capable of granting rights of audience to its members. In 2007, in light of the procurement of rights of audience, the ALCD has bestowed the title of \\"costs lawyer\\" upon all Fellows of the Association who have successfully completed a designated advocacy course. Such rights have considerably enhanced the status and reputation of those in the profession who have qualified as costs lawyers.

It opened in May 2003 as the successor of the Neue Galerie der Stadt Linz (New Gallery of the City of Linz). The museum building was designed by the Zurich architects Weber & Hofer. It is 130 meters long, provides approximately 8000 m2 for use, and has a transparent glass facade, illuminated at night. It is located directly on the Danube between the Nibelungen Bridge and Brucknerhaus. History 120 important art works from the collection of the Berlin art dealer Wolfgang Gurlitt (1888‚Äì1965), including paintings and graphic works by Klimt, Schiele, Kokoschka, Nolde, Corinth and Pechstein, formed the foundation of the collection of the New Gallery of the City of Linz after World War II. Building on these holdings, the city of Linz decided in 1953 to continue the New Gallery as a city museum with an active exhibition program and acquisition policies, and in 1998 to build the Lentos Museum, which opened in May 2003. Lentos seeks to present significant themes and issues of contemporary art in relation to 20th-century art history. And so on... This is exemplified by displaying works and schools of modern art and their consequences, whereby the Lentos collection is highlighted in specific selections according to alternating focal points. Exhibitions of loaned works of 20th century museum art regularly augment the program and communicate a sense of the genealogy of today's art. Ongoing exhibitions are enhanced by a lively program of events, tours, workshops for children and much more. The collection The art museum collection comprises around 1500 works from the areas of painting, sculpture and object art, over 10,000 works on paper, and about 850 photographs, including significant contributions to the development of artistic photography (A. Rodtschenko, Man Ray, H. Bayer). The earliest works among the museum's holdings are from the first half of the 19th century (C. D. Friedrich, J. B. Reiter). From the area of classical modernism the Lentos collection includes important paintings by Klimt, Schiele, Kokoschka, Corinth and Pechstein. The collection also covers the inter-war period with works from German and Austrian Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity). The period after 1945 is exemplified with outstanding works and ensembles of international art, including paintings, sculptures and graphic works by Appel, Bayer, Nay, Warhol, Haring, Staudacher, Lassnig, L√ºpertz, Rainer, Chillida, Cragg, Helnwein, Scheibl, Scully, Balkenhol, Caro, Goeschl, Export, Krystufek, Ludwig Merwart and others. Internationality of the sculpture collection The sculpture collection holdings are continuously expanded through active acquisition policies. Since May 2004 the Viennese curator, critic and journalist Stella Rollig has been the director of the Lentos Art museum. In addition to the existing collection, modern art and the most current trends in contemporary art are presented in changing exhibitions.  Bibliography  * Van Uffelen, Chris.

The line runs from the border settlement of Deniliquin into Bendigo, before turning south-southeast towards Melbourne, terminating in Docklands near the central business district. It is a major trunk line both for passenger and freight trains, with many railway lines branching off from it. The line has been closed between Deniliquin and Echuca. History =The Company= Construction of the line was begun by the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company, which was incorporated in 1852. The first thirteen sections of the line were constructed by contractors Cornish and Bruce, who gained a reputation for trying to reduce costs by taking shortcuts on materials and reducing worker's wages.John Maxwell, 'Cornish, William Crocker (1815‚Äì1859)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 3, Melbourne University Press, 1969, p. 464. Retrieved on 11 July 2009.John Maxwell, 'Bruce, John Vans Agnew (1822‚Äì1863)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 3, Melbourne University Press, 1969, pp 277‚Äì278. Retrieved on 11 July 2009 The Company made almost no progress on the construction of the railway due to an inability to raise sufficient funds, and in 1856 it was purchased by the Victorian Government. Because Isambard Kingdom Brunel was at that time the Inspecting Engineer in Britain for the Victorian Government, some people have claimed that he was responsible for the railway's design. An examination of reports published by the Victorian Parliament has shown that this claim is erroneous. The route and structures were the work of the Victorian Railways Department, under the supervision of Engineer in Chief George Christian Darbyshire, and completed under Thomas Higginbotham. =Design= The line was designed with two broad gauge tracks, high speed alignments cutting through the landscape, substantial bridges and railway stations built of bluestone, and double-headed rail. =Timeline of construction= Originating from Spencer Street Station, the line reached Sunbury in 1859. On 13 January 1859, the Government Railway from Melbourne to Sunbury was opened. By 1861 it had reached Woodend and on 8 July 1861 the Sunbury to Woodend section opened. By 1862 the Woodend to Kyneton section was built. On 25 April 1862 the Woodend to Kyneton section was opened. Later in 1862, the line had been completed to Castlemaine and to Bendigo. On 7 October the first locomotive reached Bendigo. Another Official Opening was held at Castlemaine on 15 October 1862. The whole of the Melbourne to Bendigo railway was formally opened at Bendigo on 20 October 1862 by the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The railway finally reached Echuca in 1864 and transformed the town into a major river port, with a famous wharf and substantial urban growth in the 1870s. In 1876 the Deniliquin and Moama Railway Company opened its private railway northwards to Barnes and Deniliquin, and the line at Echuca was extended across the Murray River into Moama to join the railway. This section was taken over by Victorian Railways in 1923, as part of the 1922 Border Railways Act. =Decline= Passenger rail services from Echuca to Balranald were withdrawn on 7 November 1975, with the last train a 153hp Walker railmotor. The Echuca to Kyabram service was withdrawn on 18 December 1975. The last train was also 153 hp Walker railmotor, the service being provided for school children and paid for by the Education Department. The Bendigo ‚Äì Echuca ‚Äì Deniliquin passenger service was withdrawn on 11 January 1979, with the last train being operated by a DERM. Toolamba ‚Äì Echuca passenger services were withdrawn on 2 March 1981, leaving the town without any rail services. =Revival and present day= A twice-weekly passenger service from Bendigo to Echuca was reinstated in 1996. The passenger service was replaced with buses on 19 December 2004, pending an upgrade due to poor track condition. The rail service recommenced in late 2006. Since 2007, there is one train to/from Melbourne on weekdays and two on weekends, with the train speed between Bendigo and Echuca limited to 80 km/h because there are a number of unprotected level crossings. The section between Bendigo and Sunbury was upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project between 2005 and 2006. The section of the Deniliquin railway line from Echuca to Deniliquin closed on 6 August 2010. Epsom railway station, located between Bendigo and Elmore stations, was opened on 12 October 2014. As part of the Regional Rail Revival project, new stations at Huntly and Goornong are scheduled to open in 2021 and 2022. Branch lines The Lancefield line was opened from Clarkefield (north of Sunbury) to Lancefield in 1881, and extended to Kilmore in 1892 to connect with the Heathcote railway line. This line was completely closed by 1956. The Daylesford branch line was opened from Carlsruhe (between Woodend and Kyneton) to Daylesford in 1880. In 1887 it was later connected with a line from Ballarat. This Daylesford branch was closed in 1978, but part of it, between Daylesford and Bullarto, is now operated by the Daylesford Spa Country Railway as a heritage railway. A branch line was built between Redesdale Junction (north of Kyneton) and Redesdale by 1900, but it closed in 1954. The Maldon line was opened from Castlemaine to Maldon in 1884, and extended as far as Shelbourne in 1891, although it had originally been planned to run to Laanecoorie. The line from Maldon to Shelbourne was closed in 1969 following bush fire damage. The Maldon branch line closed in 1976. The Victorian Goldfields Railway has restored the line between Castlemaine and Maldon and operates trains over that section. A branch line was built from Bendigo to Heathcote in 1888, which became a cross-country line in 1890 when connected to a line running from Heathcote Junction on the main North East railway line. The Bendigo‚ÄìHeathcote line closed in 1958 and the Heathcote Junction to Heathcote branch was closed in November 1968. A branch line was built from Elmore to Cohuna in 1910 and it was closed in the 1980s. A branch line was built from Barnes to Moulamein and Balranald in 1926. The Moulamein‚ÄìBalranald section was closed in the 1980s. =Piangil line= The Piangil line was extended north from Eaglehawk (just north of Bendigo on the line to Inglewood) in 1882, reaching Swan Hill in 1890. It remains in use today. =Robinvale line= The Robinvale line was opened from Bendigo to Inglewood in 1876, Korong Vale in 1882, Boort in 1883, Quambatook in 1894, Ultima in 1900, Chillingollah in 1909, Manangatang in 1914, Annuello in 1921 and Robinvale in 1924. This line currently handles only grain trains. Under the Border Railways Agreement of 1922, Victorian Railways commenced construction of a railway to Koorakee and Lette in New South Wales in 1924 (the Lette railway line), but this railway was never completed. The Murray River bridge between Robinvale and Euston was instead converted to a road bridge, but it was demolished upon completion of a new road bridge in 2006. However the lift span of the old bridge has been relocated to McGinty Park in Robinvale as part of an historic display. A short branch line was built from Wedderburn Junction (south of Korong Vale) to Wedderburn in the 1880s which closed in the 1980s. There is currently no passenger service on this line. =Kulwin line= The Kulwin line was opened from Korong Vale to Wycheproof in 1883, Sea Lake in 1895, Nandaly in 1914, Mittyack in 1919 and Kulwin in 1919. This line currently only handles grain trains. Until late 2006, rural rail network lessee Pacific National had mothballed the Mittyack to Kulwin section. There has not been passenger service on this line since before 1984.  Features  There are substantial wrought iron and masonry viaducts at Sunbury, Malmsbury and Taradale, as well as two tunnels at Elphinstone and Big Hill. Passenger services The Deniliquin line is used by many regional V/Line services and a commuter Metro Trains service. Sunbury line commuter services operate on the entire Melbourne section of the line between Sunbury and Southern Cross, where it then enters the City Loop. Regional Bendigo line services operate on the same line between Bendigo (and sometimes Epsom) and Southern Cross. Swan Hill services enter the line at Bendigo from the Piangil line and also run on the same route into Melbourne. The section of the line between Sunshine and Southern Cross is also used by Ararat, Ballarat, Geelong and Warrnambool services. At Sunshine, these services branch off onto the Serviceton line. Most V/Line regional passenger trains operate on the second pair of tracks between Sunshine and Southern Cross that were built as part of the Regional Rail Link project, leaving the original pair of tracks for the primary use of the Sunbury commuter rail line. =Echuca services= One service on weekdays and two services on weekends operate in each direction each day between Echuca and Southern Cross. Outside Melbourne, all services stops at all operating stations between Echuca and Sunbury. The service then runs express to Footscray, then to the terminus at Southern Cross. At Footscray, passengers may not board services to Southern Cross or alight services to Echuca.

A Grade II* listed building originally known as East Cliff Hall, it is located on the top of the East Cliff, next to the Royal Bath Hotel. History and collections In 1897, the architect John Frederick Fogerty was commissioned by Merton Russell-Cotes, then the owner of the Royal Bath Hotel, to build a house as a birthday present for his wife Annie. Originally called East Cliff Hall, it was built in the northeast section of his hotel's garden. Built in the Art Nouveau style with interiors by John Thomas and his son Oliver. It was completed in its first form in 1901. In 1907, Annie Russell-Cotes donated East Cliff Hall and its contents as a museum to the town of Bournemouth and Merton donated his fine art collection. In return they were made honorary freemen of the town. They continued living in part of the house and over the next ten years they paid for an extension to be built and made further donations including the freehold of the site. It was formally opened by Princess Beatrice in 1919. After their deaths the Borough of Bournemouth took over the running of East Cliff Hall and re-opened it as the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum on 10 March 1922. After Sir Merton's death, it was extended into his part of the house; a further extension was opened in 2000.Russell-Cotes Family History East Cliff Hall History The house and the new annexe display various items collected in the course of Sir Merton's foreign travels, especially to Japan, and paintings from his personal art collection. One room is the Sir Henry Irving Museum; Irving, a friend of the Russell-Cotes', had stayed in that room. When Irving died in 1905, this room was devoted to his memory. Items purchased at the sale of Irving's effects formed the basis of the Irving Museum and were displayed with memorabilia associated with his contemporaries such as Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt. Exhibitions Twice-yearly exhibitions of contemporary art support works from the main collection, and have included painter Jonathan Yeo and sculptor Jon Edgar in 2011. Children's facilities The new annexe also has a restaurant and a play area for young children. The art gallery in the old annexe displays a wide and frequently changing collection of pictures and statues. Older children are invited to complete a \\"detective sheet\\", for example finding where there are pictures of a bat, a kingfisher and other animals and birds.

It was developed by Smith & Wesson from the earlier Smith & Wesson Model 39 by adapting a 14-round capacity stagger-stack magazine. History and users It was designed for the U.S. Navy as a large-capacity version of the S&W; Model 39, the basis of their Mark 22 \\"Mark 22 Hush Puppy\\" suppressed pistol. In 1965, the U.S. Navy commissioned a version of the S&W; Model 39 that could take the 13-round magazine of the Browning Hi-Power. In early 1970, a dozen experimental all-stainless-steel prototypes were made and were issued to Navy SEAL commandos for evaluation in the field. The firearm was not adopted. The Model 59 went on the market in 1971. It went out of production a decade later in 1982 when the improved second generation series was introduced (the Model 459). Design The Model 59 was manufactured in 9√ó19mm Parabellum caliber with a wider anodized aluminum frame, a straight backstrap, a magazine disconnect (the pistol will not fire unless a magazine is in place), and a blued carbon steel slide that carries the manual safety. The grip is of three pieces made of two nylon plastic panels joined by a metal backstrap. It uses a magazine release located to the rear of the trigger guard, similar to the M1911A1.  Magazine  The magazine for the Model 59 is similar to that of the Browning Hi-Power. Initially introduced with a capacity of 14 rounds, this was later increased to 15 rounds for future variants. Smith & Wesson also made an extended, 20-round version. Many firearms have been introduced to use this pattern of magazine including the Marlin Camp Carbine as well as the Kel-Tec P11, Sub9, and Sub2000. Model 459 The Smith & Wesson Model 459 was an updated version of the Model 59 with adjustable sights and checkered nylon grips. This model was discontinued in 1988. 803 units were produced in a brush finish with special grips made to FBI specifications.

He is a member of the Earth First! environmental movement. He lives in Humboldt County, California. Cherney has produced five albums of his own political satire, and founded Environmentally Sound Promotions and Churn It Up Records. Together with Greg King, in 1986 he co-founded the movement to save what eventually became the federally protected Headwaters Forest Reserve near Eureka, California. He organized four rallies in support of Julia Butterfly Hill's two-year tree sit. He organized the Redwood Summer campaign with Judi Bari. One of Cherney's songs, \\"Where Are We Gonna Work (When the Trees Are Gone?)\\", has been covered by Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon on their album Prairie Home Invasion. Political campaigns Cherney ran for Congress in the 1988 Democratic primary, where he met fellow activist Judi Bari. Cherney ran for the Green Party presidential nomination in 2016. He ran a \\"no money in politics\\" campaign on social media, featuring the hashtag #FeelTheChern. Pipe bomb and aftermath On May 24, 1990, Cherney was injured when a pipe bomb exploded in the car he and Judi Bari were traveling in. Bari was severely injured by the explosion. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which accused Bari and Cherney of bombing themselves. Bari and Cherney subsequently sued the FBI and Oakland Police agents for violations of the United States Constitution. Cherney and the late Bari's estate were awarded $4.4 million for violations of the First Amendment (freedom of speech) and the Fourth Amendment (the right to be free from unlawful arrest and illegal search and seizure). In 2012, Cherney told KHUM radio that he does not consider himself an \\"extremist,\\" preferring the term \\"radical.\\" In 2012, Cherney's documentary film Who Bombed Judi Bari? was released.

Super Famicom version The race proceeds in a straight line without any 360¬∞ effects to simulate turning around and going in different direction. Most of the turns are on a 30¬∞ angle; forcing the player to turn sharply to the left and to the right. At the end of the game, there is a message that says \\"Those who have tasted the waters of Africa will always long to be here\\" along with some synthesized beats. This message will play right after the \\"game over\\" screen no matter if the player wins or loses the game. Driving by Tripoli, Libya The object of the game is to travel from the cosmopolitan landscape of Tripoli, Libya to the swamp regions of West Africa (including the target of Dakar) in a rally race. Hitting various components of the environment in addition to the other rally vehicles will cause the player's vehicle to take damage. Taking too much damage will result in trouble for any or all of the vehicle's components. There are many navigators (one female, five male) that know every crook and cranny of Africa (the signals are given by nudges to turn either left or right). In addition to this, there are many corporate sponsors (with names sounding similar to real life corporations), auto mechanics, and automobile parts to choose from as the player goes for more than through tricky terrain. Deserts, jungles, and even darkness can astonish and even distract an unwary player. The object is to finish each leg of the rally before time runs out (failing to achieve this goal will result in a disqualification and an immediate game over - like in the real life rally circuit). Navigators help to serve a purpose by directing players safely past areas of darkness in the race. Engine parts must be replaced approximately by a head mechanic and his/her support mechanic. Racing equipment (tires, engine, brakes) must be packed up in the vehicle; creating extra weight that slows down the vehicle's top speed rating. The goal is to have as many replacement parts as possible while keeping the vehicle as light as possible. Doing this all will be a challenge for even the best video game rally racing drivers in the world. Emergencies do not cost money to use but will cause the player to lose time on the clock while waiting for the repair truck to appear. Having no parts will eventually cause the vehicle to stall on the rally; eating up precious time until it finally runs out.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Big Run on their November 15, 1989 issue as being the second most-successful upright arcade game of the year.

They play in the top division in Nigerian football, the Nigeria Premier League after promotion in 2017 from the Nigeria National League. Their home stadium is the Kwara State Stadium. History The club's roots go back to the Kwara Water Corporation Football Club in 1974. It was supposed to be an in-house club for the staffers of the Water Corporation. Due to the results and depth of talents in the club, the scope was opened and by 1979 qualified to play in the National League second division alongside the First Bank F.C. of Lagos. That same year, the club got to the quarter-final stage of the Football Association Cup (otherwise called the Challenge Cup) where she lost to Bendel Insurance football club of Benin 2‚Äì1. In 1985, due to the change in the name of the parent corporation to Kwara Utility Board, the club changed its name to Kwara Utility Bombers of Ilorin. It was relegated to division three at the end of that season. With the disengagement of the parent corporation from financing the team in 1990, the club adjusted its name to Kwara Bombers football club of Ilorin. It suffered financial stress, which culminated in her relegation to division three in 1996. The new state government led by Colonel Peter Asum Ogar led the purchase in March 1997 of the Exide Club of Ibadan, moved them to Ilorin and took their slot in the Second Division. Ogar christened the new outfit Kwara United Football Club of Ilorin. The club came third at the end of the 2006 Super Four play-off behind Ocean Boys and Nasarawa United FC and qualified for the 2007 edition of the CAF Confederation Cup. The coaching staff for the 2006‚Äì07 season included Swedes Roger Palmgren and Johan Eriksson (son of former England and Mexico manager, Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson). The team was coached former players of the team: Toyin Ayinla, Tunde Sanni and Aliyu Muzambilu (Goalkeeper trainer) following the passing of Technical Adviser Kafaru Alabi on January 8, 2008. However, they were relegated from the Premier League on the last day of the 2007/08 season on goal differential. They regained promotion back to the top level the next year as Champions of Division 1-A. The team appointed an Investment Consultant, Goldenwing33 Nigeria Limited, headed by former Nigerian international and former deputy editor (Sports) of Thisday newspaper, Olajide Ayodeji Fashikun. The Investment Consultant is to organise the privatisation and private sector participation in the club's funding in two years. The fans of the club have one of the worst reputations in Nigeria, as witnessed during a vicious beating of the referees after a 0‚Äì0 tie in 2008. Kwara played some of the 2010/11 season in Offa and Abeokuta as the ground was renovated. After relegation in 2013 they won promotion back in 2014. After their last game with Ranchers Bees was abandoned in Kaduna with 28 minutes to play tied at 2‚Äì2, they played again at a neutral site with Kwara needing the win and three points to leapfrog Ranchers for promotion. The replay was again abandoned when Bees' players attacked the referee and team staff encroached the field. The League ruled Bees at fault, fined the club and awarded the win to Kwara United, thus securing the promotion. =Farm Club= The club is owner of Kwara United Feeders Team of Ilorin.Il Kwara United Feeders Team ospite dello Spezia Calcio Club Names *1974‚Äì85: Kwara Water Corporation football club *1985‚Äì90: Kwara Utility Bombers of Ilorin *1990‚Äì97: Kwara Bombers Football Club of Ilorin *1997‚Äì: Kwara United Football Club of Ilorin Achievements *Nigerian Premier League: 1 ::2006 Regular Season champions, 3rd in Super Four Play-off *National Second Division: 1 ::1997 Performance in CAF competitions *CAF Confederation Cup: 1 appearance ::2007 ‚Äì Group stage *CAF Cup: 1 appearance ::1999 ‚Äì Quarter-finals Current squad Former coaches * Kafaru Alabi * Toyin Ayinla * Johann Eriksson * Kosta Papiƒá * Roger Palmgren (2006‚Äì07) * Kadiri Ikhana (1997), (2010‚Äì11) * Tunde Sanni (2011‚Äì12) * Samson Unuanel (2012‚Äì13), (2013‚Äì14) * Babatunde Abdulrahmon (2014‚Äì2015) * John Sam Obuh (2015‚Äì2017) * Abubakar Bala (2017‚Äì2019) Notes Category:Football clubs in Nigeria Category:Kwara State Category:Association football clubs established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Nigeria Category:Sports clubs in Nigeria ","title":"Kwara United F.C."},{"id":"6657008","text":"Ranchers Bees FC is a Nigerian football club based in Kaduna.

The film starts in Paris, where King Kong (Sam Hui) is kidnapped by a British secret agent (Jean Marchent) whose mission is to retrieve one of the Crown Jewels which has been stolen and is located in a Hong Kong Police Headquarters vault. Aces Go Places 3 was the highest-grossing film in Hong Kong on its release in 1984 and was the highest-grossing film in the series. The film was released in an English- language dub titled Mad Mission 3 which had scenes cut and altered from the original film. Tsui had previously appeared in the first two films in cameos. Cast * Sam Hui as King Kong * Karl Maka as Albert Au * Sylvia Chang as Nancy Ho * Ricky Hui as Puffer Fish * John Shum as Police chief * Neil Connery as Mr. Bond Production Aces Go Places 3 riffs off the plots of the James Bond series and features cameos from actors in various English-language spy features. These include Peter Graves from the Mission: Impossible television series and Richard Kiel who played Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. The film also features an actor who resembles the character Oddjob. Release Aces Go Places 3 was released on 26 January 1984. The film was a success with audiences, becoming the highest-grossing film in Hong Kong in the year end box office and was the highest-grossing film in the Aces Go Places series.Morton, 2009. p. 141 An English-dubbed version of the film was released under the title Mad Mission 3. This version removes about 20 minutes of footage including scenes from the original film with Karl Maka's Albert, the baby and a maid and scenes with Sylvia Chang's character, Ho, in the hospital. This version includes additional comedy scenes with Peter Graves' character. Reception Allmovie gave the film three stars out of five, noting that the plot for Aces Go Places 3 was \\"stronger than usual for the series\\" and \\"that film's juvenile sense of humor might put off viewers in search of more sophisticated fare, but many others are likely to find the movie too colorful and exciting to be denied.\\" John Charles, author Hong Kong Filmography 1977-1997 awarded the film a six out of ten rating finding the scenes involving Sylvia Chang and Karl Maka were \\"tiresome and consist almost exclusively of situations from old sitcoms\\".

Zuzalpheus The genus Zuzalpheus was established for S. gambarelloides, S. brooksi, and their closest relatives, which contain several notably eusocial species. While these do seem to form a clade, it is not fully resolved whether or not they are indeed the sister taxon of all the remaining Synalpheus. However, a detailed cladistic study of morphological characters found well marked differences between the proposed two genera and concluded that the supposed species groups around S. biunguiculatus/S. coutierei, S. brevicarpus and S. neomeris are neither clearly defined nor, as it seems, monophyletic, while the group separated in Zuzalpheus was clearly distinct in characters of the minor first walking legs (pereiopods), and usually distinct in some others; in all Synalpheus sensu stricto checked to date, the transverse setal comb on the back of the minor first pereopod dactyl is missing, and the carpus is plump (about as wide as it is long or slightly wider) and small (not longer than half the length of the palm). Moreover, their stylocerite clearly extends beyond the whole first segment of the first antennae, their scaphocerite blade is never missing, the fixed finger of the major first pereopod is about the same length as the dactyl and the uropodal exopod always has one tooth only; these traits however may be also present in some of the species separated in Zuzalpheus though as far as can be told, most of these differ. While the authors of the 2008 analysis made no explicit comment on the status of the newly proposed genus, they thus found the S. gambarelloides species group to be well-marked, and their results certainly harden the case for recognition of Zuzalpheus at least as a subgenus. However, this analysis only included 2 species from the S. gambarelloides species group, and none from the Caribbean, where the vast majority of the group resides. Opinion is still divided, however, and recently Zuzalpheus was synonymised with Synalpheus. Distribution In the narrower sense, Synalpheus occur in the East Pacific where they are most plentiful and probably originated, and to a lesser extent in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean; the species placed in Zuzalpheus occur mainly in the western Atlantic where their lineage probably originated, and to a lesser extent in the eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean, and the East Pacific. It may thus be that the closure of the Isthmus of Panama in the Piacenzian (about 3 million years ago) was a key factor in separating the two lineages, as species referred to Synalpheus sensu stricto are most plentiful in the western Pacific. Snapping The snapping behaviour of Synalpheus is rather well studied. In Synalpheus parneomeris, peak to peak source levels of 185‚Äì190 dB re 1 ŒºPa at 1 m were measured, depending on the size of the claw. Eusociality The only known eusocial aquatic species occur within the genus Synalpheus. The species known to be eusocial are S. brooksi, S. chacei, S. elizabethae, S. filidigitus, S. rathbunae, S. regalis, S. microneptunus, and S. duffyi as well as potentially S. riosi. Eusociality has evolved at least three times within Synalpheus. It appears that there were multiple rapid radiations between 3 and 9 mya from which the ancestors of these eusocial species appeared. Eusociality is thought to have arisen due to competition for space, because among the species that host Synalpheus, empty sponges are rarely found. It also appears that kin selection was necessary for this evolution to occur because the only species in which eusociality has appeared are non-dispersing shrimp that hatch directly into crawling individuals. Until recently, eusocial species of Synalpheus have appeared in far greater abundance than and appear to outcompete less social species for space in sponges.

The plasma was confined in the small area between the two magnets. Drawing of the MFTF building The Mirror Fusion Test Facility, or MFTF, was an experimental magnetic confinement fusion device built using the tandem magnetic mirror design. It was, by far, the largest, most powerful and most expensive mirror machine ever constructed. Due to budget cuts, it was mothballed the day after its construction was complete, and sat unused for a year before being formally cancelled. $372 million dollars were spent on the system during its lifetime. MFTF was the ultimate development of a series of machines at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) that trace their history back to the early 1950s. Over the years one problem after another had been addressed, leading to designs using \\"baseball\\" and \\"yin-yang\\" mirrors. By the late 1960s, it appeared possible to build stable mirrors. However, these changes had also lowered their economic performance, to the point where they appeared unattractive as power generators. A new concept introduced in the early 1970s, the tandem mirror, appeared to offer a way forward. In 1968 the Soviets demonstrated their tokamak systems were outperforming all others by a factor of at least ten times. The path to practical fusion appeared open, and in the US, Robert Hirsch began plans to produce a prototype power plant using the tokamak design. Having secured a massive budget increase, and desiring a second design in case the tokamak didn't pan out, a study of the alternative concepts suggested the best developed was the tandem mirror, and the MFTF concept was born. A smaller version, the Tandem Mirror Experiment (TMX), was also funded to test the basic layout. Construction of MFTF and TMX began in 1977. TMX was much smaller and easier to build than MFTF, and began operations in 1979. By the early 1980s, TMX was beginning to demonstrate serious problems that suggested MFTF would not work as predicted. This was occurring around the same time that Ronald Reagan declared that the energy crisis was over. In a series of sweeping budget cuts across the entire energy research field, MFTF had its operational budget cancelled, although its construction budget survived. Construction completed in 1986, and the facility sat unused for a year being scavenged for parts by other researchers until it was formally cancelled in 1987 and disassembled.  History  It was designed and built at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), one of the primary research centers for mirror fusion devices. It cost 372 million dollars to construct, making it at the time the most expensive project in the lab's history. It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down. The reason given was to balance the United States federal budget. Following on from the earlier Baseball II device, the facility was originally a similar system in which the confinement area was located between two horseshoe-shaped \\"mirrors\\". During construction the success of the Tandem Mirror Experiment (\\"TMX\\") led to a redesign to insert a solenoid area between two such magnets, dramatically improving confinement time from a few milliseconds to over one second.The Tandem Mirror Fusion Test Facility Most of the fusion power would be produced in the long solenoid. The yin-yang magnets would then serve only to dam up the ends in order to maintain good plasma confinement in the solenoid. Limited to break- even energy balance, the magnetic mirror endcaps consumed power, but much less than that produced in a solenoid of sufficient length. A new version, officially MFTF-B, started construction in 1977 and was completed in 1986 on the very day the project was canceled. No experiments were performed. Rollbacks in fusion research funding dramatically reduced funding levels across the entire field.  Legacy  Parts of the MFTF have since been re- used on newer fusion experiments, one of which won a recycling award.Re-using MFTF parts  References  Category:Magnetic mirrors Category:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ","title":"Mirror Fusion Test Facility"},{"id":"6657121","text":"Association Sportive et Culturelle HLM is a Senegalese football club based in Dakar.

In 2001, Georgallis joined the Warrington Wolves for a season. Wolves' coach Darryl van der Velde said at the time, \\"He knows what Rugby League's all about. He is very strong, has good hands and is always busy on the field.\\" Unfortunately, Georgallis only lasted 6 games before the end of his professional career, though he did make later appearances as captain of Greece.

Various roles and existence =As the cause of the first schism= Various sources present MahƒÅdeva as playing different roles, and the historical existence of such a person is often criticized. In sources deriving from the SthaviravƒÅda branch, he is taken to be the founder of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and the figure who caused the split between the two branches.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 49-50 According to this account, some 35 years after the Second Buddhist Council at Vaishali, there was another meeting over five points allegedly held by a figure named MahƒÅdeva.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 47 These five points were essentially regarding doctrines of the fallibility and imperfection of arhats, which were opposed by some.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 47 In this account, the majority (MahƒÅsa·πÉgha) sided with MahƒÅdeva, and the minority (Sthaviras) were opposed to it, thus causing a split in the Sa·πÉgha.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 47 However, scholars have generally agreed that the matter of dispute was a matter of vinaya instead.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 In the earliest account, the council was convened at PƒÅ·π≠aliputra over matters of vinaya, and it is explained that the schism resulted from the majority (MahƒÅsa·πÉgha) refusing to accept the addition of rules to the Vinaya by the minority (Sthaviras).Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 This account is bolstered by the vinaya texts themselves, as vinayas associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 For example, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika PrƒÅtimok·π£a has 67 rules in the ≈õaik·π£a-dharma section, while the TheravƒÅda version has 75 rules.Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 2. 2005. p. 190 Modern scholarship is generally in agreement that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya is the oldest.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 Joseph Walser concludes that this MahƒÅdeva was most likely a literary figure.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 50 =As founder of the Caitika schools= The Samayabhedoparacanacakra records that MahƒÅdeva was a completely different figure who was the founder of the Caitika sect over 100 years later.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 49-50 A number of scholars have concluded that an association of \\"MahƒÅdeva\\" with the first schism was a later sectarian interpolation.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 50 Jan Nattier and Charles Prebish state that MahƒÅdeva was the later founder of the Caitikas, stating:Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 2. 2005. p. 188 Legends about evil deeds Numerous legends about MahƒÅdeva exist, all of which refer to the figure who supposedly caused the first schism in the Buddhist sa·πÉgha. He was ordained at Kukkutarama in Pataliputra, before taking the head of the sangha. The story of his transformation from a sinner of the worst kind to a learned monk was among the collection of tales relating to Buddhism, taken back to China by Xuanzang. The story of his transformation is titled as \\"The sins of Mahadeva\\". His father was a wealthy and ambitious trader who had married at a very young age. He often went away to foreign lands to trade and amass wealth. It is said that Mahadeva had a very pleasant and radiant face. But he was unfortunate not to get the love of his father during his childhood. In his teens he committed his first sin, by indulging in an incestuous relationship with his mother. Mahadeva was frightened of his father coming to know about this relationship and hence murdered him, thereby committing his second cardinal sin. He then, in order to escape from the guilt ran away with his mother to a distant land and started life fresh. But there, one day he ran into an old neighbour who was on a tour to the land that Mahadeva had made his new home. The man was treated as a guest and was given refuge for a few days in Mahadeva's house. After a few days the guest started asking questions about Mahadeva's sudden disappearance from his native land. Mahadeva felt threatened and poisoned the guest, thereby committing his third cardinal sin. Some years later he began to doubt his mother, for whom he had committed all the murders. When he found that his mother was involved in a relationship with another man, Mahadeva felt emotionally wrecked and out of his frustration he murdered his mother thereby committing the fourth cardinal sin of his life. After this incident Mahadeva found his life meaningless and teetered on the brink of insanity. He, in fact was about to take his own life when he came to know that a Buddhist monk with a panacea for sinners had arrived in the town. Mahadeva decided to give his wretched life one more chance and approached the monk who was camping near Pataliputra. It was at this place that Mahadeva was ordained as member of the Buddhist sangha.

They contain some of the earliest known cave paintings of domesticated African aurochs (Bos primigenius africanus) in the Horn of Africa. Laas Geel's rock art is estimated to date somewhere around circa 18,000 BC or 20,000 years ago. Discovery Laas Geel rock exterior During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in Somaliland by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves that contained archaeological sediments and infills in order to document the historical period when production economy appeared in this part of the Horn of Africa (circa 5,000 to 2,000 years BC). During the course of the survey, the excavation team discovered the Laas Geel cave paintings, that encompass an area of ten rock alcoves (caves).The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3 In an excellent state of preservation, the rock art depicts wild animals and decorated cattle (cows and bulls). They also feature herders, who are believed to be the creators of the paintings. Laas Geel's rock art is executed in the same distinctive Ethiopian- Arabian style as the Dhambalin and Karinhegane cave paintings that are also situated in Somaliland. Although the Laas Geel rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries, its existence only came to international attention after the 2002 discovery. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings in their prehistoric context. Somaliland in general, is home to numerous such archaeological sites and megalithic structures, with similar rock art found at Haadh, Gudmo Biyo Cas, Dhambalin, Dhagah Maroodi and numerous other sites, while ancient edifices are, among others, found at Sheikh, Aynabo, Aw- Barkhadle, Ancient Amud, Heis, Maydh, Haylan, Qa‚Äôableh, Qombo'ul and El Ayo. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.Michael Hodd, East African Handbook, (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640. Foreign tourists with local guides in the caves of Laas Geel Description The Laas Geel cave paintings are thought to be some of the most vivid rock art in Africa. Among other things, they depict cattle in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans, who are believed to have been inhabitants of the region. The necks of the cattle are embellished with a kind of plastron. Some of the cattle are also portrayed wearing decorative robes. Besides long-horned cattle, the rock art also shows an image of a domesticated dog, several paintings of Canidae as well as a giraffe. The site is excellently preserved due to the location of the paintings which are covered by the granite overhangs.

This was the result of one man's determination to improve the plight of Fiji's Indian cane farmers. Ayodhya Prasad had arrived from India in 1929, and after a stint as a teacher took up cane farming and thus obtained firsthand experience of the problems faced by Fiji Indian cane farmers.  Formation of Kisan Sangh  Well aware that there was great fear amongst the Fiji Indian cane farmers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he started organising the farmers union in secret and concentrated among the young members of the community because they were more passionate and were unlikely to be owners or lessees of property. At first, Ayodhya Prasad held meetings in secret but by 27 November 1937, he had enough support to hold a public meeting in Wailailai, Ba, to form the Kisan Sangh (Farmers' Union). The first task for the new Union was to find an existing Fiji Indian to take up leadership of the new union. A number of people which included A. D. Patel, S. B. Patel and Swami Rudrananda, Chattur Singh and Vishnu Deo were approached, but all declined the invitation. Undeterred, Ayodhya Prasad decided that the best solution was to learn from Mahatma Gandhi and live amongst the farmers while he preached the virtues of the Union to them. He decided to set up tents on Company land in different settlements so that he and his helpers could preach from it. On 18 May 1938, with the help of his young volunteers, he set up on Company land starting from Nadroga which was at the Southern end of the North Western cane growing area of Viti Levu and moving along the coast to the Northern end of Viti Levu. Initially none of the local farmers approached the tent but as the farmers saw the sacrifice being made by Ayodhya Prasad and his young volunteers and the inability of the Company overseers to stop him, they gradually started to join up. Following the success of this grass-roots campaign, Ayodhya Prasad spent the next four months organising the Sangh. First village committees were formed. These committees then met and formed district committees which selected members for the Central Committee based on the membership of the district committee. There were six district committees.  Attempts to negotiate with the Company  On 5 February 1939, 36 members of the central board of the Kisan Sangh met at the residence of Mohammed Twahir Khan in Lautoka. Mohammed Twahir Khan was unanimously elected the President. Ayodhya Prasad was elected the Secretary. An office was set up in Mr Khan's residence and a letter written to the Company asking for the following: * The farmers be allowed to keep the second ratoon crop. * The Company provide a statement with its payment. * The Company allow the Kisan Sangh‚Äôs representative to check the weighing of cane. * The price of cane not be based on sugar content, but on tonnage. * The Company not force farmers to work on the train line and to cut its cane. * The Company and Kisan Sangh meet and draw up a contract for the sale of cane to the Company. * The Company provide lease on its land in a legal way and each block of land not be less than . * The Company allow the farmers to plant rice. When the Company refused to negotiate with the Kisan Sangh, a deputation met the Governor and informed him of the farmers' plight.  Taking control of cane harvesting  The Kisan Sangh put up candidates as Sardar for each of the cane-cutting gangs. Out of a total of 110 gangs in the North Western district, Kisan Sangh's candidates were elected in 85. The Kisan Sangh supporting Sardars refused to send farmers to work in the Sugar Mills. The Kisan Sangh Sardars also informed the Company's overseers that its members will not clear weeds from the Company's train lines. Soon more evidence emerged that the Government had put pressure on the Company to change the way in which it behaved towards to farmers. When the first cane payment was made by the Company, the farmers were also provided with a written account stating the rate at which they had been paid and the amount of deductions. The Company also opened a school for its overseers where they were taught to speak Hindi and the proper manner of communicating with farmers.  Campaign for cane contract  At end of the 1939 cane-cutting season, the Kisan Sangh decided to press for a firm contract for the sale of cane to the CSR Company. At a meeting of farmers from all districts in Lautoka it was unanimously decided not to plant cane until the Company had agreed to a contract. The meeting specifically asked for a 10-year contract, that the price of cane not be based on sugar content, and the price of cane be 16 shillings and six pence as long as the price of sugar remained below 10 dollars per ton and any income more than 10 pounds be shared equally between the Company and the farmers. When the Company refused to negotiate, Ayodhya Prasad and other Kisan Sangh leaders then concentrated on working amongst the farmers to ensure that the farmers did not plant cane and instead planted Rice, Corn and Peas, confident that if the farmers stuck together, the Government would pressure the Company to act since the strike would have a devastating effect on Fiji's economy. On 17 January 1940, the Company unilaterally produced a contract and the Company overseers started approaching the farmers to sign it. The contract met some of the demands of the Kisan Sangh. On 27 January, a deputation from the Sangh met the Governor. The Governor advised that since the Company had taken out a contract, the farmers should start planting cane. On 30 January, at a large public meeting in Lautoka the Kisan Sangh advised the farmers to start planting the cane but not to sign the contract. Finally the Company agreed to meet the farmers (but not as Kisan Sangh representatives). On 6 April 1940, representatives of the Kisan Sangh met the Company's inspector and the Mill Manager at Rarawai Mill in Ba. E.F. Smith (the Company Inspector) explained the contents of the Company offered contract and offered not to implement some of the strict conditions of the contract.  Formation of rival farmers' union  In June 1940, news was received of the setting up of a rival farmers' union by A.D. Patel and Swami Rudrananda. The Central Committee of the Kisan Sangh met and decided that members of the Sangh would attend the inaugural meeting of the Maha Sangh and oppose its inception. At 2:00 p.m. on 15 June, a big crowd of Sangh members gathered in the grounds of Nadi Sangam School. While the meeting for the establishment of Maha Sangh was taking place inside the school, Kisan Sangh members held their own meeting in the grounds and opposed the setting up of a second union but Police had been warned beforehand and Sangh leaders were arrested for not dispersing. During July, A.D. Patel and Swami Rudrananda started holding meetings to promote their union. Those farmers that had been hired by the Company to campaign against the Kisan Sangh during the strike of 1940 joined the Maha Sangh. The former Sardars removed by Kisan Sangh also joined the new union. Under the influence of Swami Rudrananda, who was himself a South Indian, all but a handful of South Indian farmers who had been members of the Kisan Sangh now joined the Maha Sangh. In 1943, some executive members of the Kisan Sangh supported the Maha Sangh in a strike for a new contract, despite the fact that the contract signed by farmers in 1940 was for a period of ten years. Ignoring pleas from Ayodhya Prasad, farmers did not start harvesting on time and lost thousands of dollars. In the meantime, efforts by the Government to restrict the movement of A.D. Patel only increased his support while the Kisan Sangh was badly split.  Rebuilding the Kisan Sangh  It took Ayodhya Prasad until 1950 to rebuild the Kisan Sangh so that it was again the largest farmers' organisation in Fiji with support extending to the northern cane farming areas in Vanua Levu and a new farmers' union allied to the Kisan Sangh active in the Rewa area. He also managed to force the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) to agree a new 10-year contract in 1950 which gave further increases to the price of sugar cane. In 1959, Kisan Sangh joined a united cane growers' organisation, known as the Federation of Cane Growers, to negotiate the next ten-year contract. Differences again rose between the Kisan Sangh and Maha Sangh supporters resulting in Kisan Sangh's supporters signing the new cane contract, while A.D. Patel's supporters went on strike. The Kisan Sangh was blamed for the failure of the farmers to get a good deal.  Kisan Sangh and Fiji Indian politics  Kisan Sangh's support was concentrated in the North Western districts of Viti Levu and it consistently affected its result. In the 1940 Legislative Council election, the Kisan Sangh supported B.D. Lakshman won North Western Constituency seat in the Legislative Council. Following the split within the Kisan Sangh, A.D. Patel easily won in 1944. A.D. Patel managed to retain this seat with a reduced majority in 1947. In the 1950 election, Tulsi Ram Sharma, who was supported by Kisan Sangh, won the seat by 2340 votes to 1850 votes for A.D. Patel. The Kisan Sangh general secretary, Ayodhya Prasad, was himself elected as the member for North Western Constituency in 1953 and 1956. In 1959, Ayodhya Prasad lost his seat to his one-time ally, B. D. Lakshman. In the election for the expanded Legislative Council in 1963, three Kisan Sangh supported candidates, lost to A.D. Patel's Citizen's Federation candidates. In the 1966 Legislative Council election, Ayodhya Prasad again stood against A.D. Patel, and lost by a large margin. Negotiations for 1960 Contract In 1959, the Maha Sangh and four other cane farmers' unions formed an umbrella organisation known as the Federation of Cane Growers to negotiate with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for the new cane contract. While negotiations were still in progress, the Kisan Sangh withdrew from the Federation and signed the contract offered by the sugar company, leaving the Maha Sangh as the dominant group within the Federation of Cane Growers.  The Decline of the Kisan Sangh  In the 1970s and 1980s, the Kisan Sangh gradually lost support to the Federation of Cane Growers, which is affiliated to the National Federation Party. When the Fiji Labour Party was formed in 1985, the FLP-affiliated National Farmers Union further eroded the Kisan Sangh, which is at present only a minor player in Fiji sugar industry.

Background Educated in Helsinki, Ullberg returned to his home town Viipuri in 1906. He drew most of his buildings in Viipuri, but during the last years of his life also in Finland's capital Helsinki. Viipuri belonged until 1809 to the Kingdom of Sweden. During 1809‚Äì1917 it was a part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. It was the second largest city of independent Finland as of 1917. After being conquered by the Soviet Union's red army in both 1940 during the Winter War and then again in 1944 during the Continuation War, it then became a part of the Soviet Union under the Russian name Vyborg after the 1947 peace treaty in Paris, France. When the Soviet Union disbanded itself in 1991, it became a part of Russia. The style of Ullberg‚Äôs architecture covers the transition in architecture from so-called Nordic Classicism of the 1920s to Functionalism during the 1930s. Ullberg is regarded as a leading architect of the Nordic Classicism period and was the first to introduce Functionalism to Viipuri.Paavilainen, Simo: Nordic Classicism 1910‚Äì1930. Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki, 1982. Though his most notable buildings were constructed in Viipuri, he became famous not only in his native town but nationwide.  Education and early works  As a child Ullberg had studied at the Viborgs konstv√§nners ritskola art school, where later also, in 1906‚Äì1913, he was a teacher. Ullberg graduated in 1901 from the architectural faculty at the Helsinki Polytechnic Institute (Polytekniska institutet in Swedish), now Aalto University. After graduating he worked as an architect at the offices of Nystr√∂m, Petrelius & Penttil√§ in Helsinki. After returning in 1906 to his native city, he opened an architectural bureau together with Axel Gyld√©n, who had studied with him in Helsinki. Together they designed Hackman House, completed in 1909, for the Hackman industrialist family. Afterwards, the partnership broke up when Ullberg decided to start working under his own name. He ran his own architect office in Vyborg in 1910‚Äì1932 and was the Vyborg city architect from 1932 until 1936, during which time he controlled the urban conception of the city and worked on the Master plan. While living in Vyborg he had also for many years been a city counselor. In 1936 he moved to Helsinki to become head of the building department of the Finnish National Board of Health in 1936‚Äì1941. The most important work created in collaboration with Gyld√©n was the headquarters of Hackman & Co (1909) at Piispankatu 14 in Viipuri. The building represents the compositional and formal variations of Jugenstil, Art Nouveau or National Romanticism. The main elevation pediments, openings, window frames, portals, and the granite facades are quite typical of National Romanticism, which at that time was also the prevailing architectural style in Finland for key public buildings, most notably in the works of architects Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen (e.g. Finnish Pavilion at Exposition Universelle (1900), Paris, and National Museum of Finland, Helsinki [1902‚Äì1904].) The interiors of the building were among the most stylish and rich in the city. The inside of the house survived harmful transformations during the Soviet period so the interior decorations were greatly damaged. Between 1910 and 1930 he designed a large number of public buildings and houses, most of which are situated in Viipuri. Among these are several office buildings in K√§kisalmi, Imatra and other Finnish towns. The early works in Viipuri could be described as traditional town architecture with a classicistic influence. The most interesting examples from this period include the reconstruction of the Union Bank (originally built in 1900), the Karjala offices (1929), the store and residence of V. Dippel (1921) and the restoration of the famous medieval Round Tower in the middle of the old city centre. Ullberg converted the massive old building into a restaurant and cafe.  From Classicism to Functionalism  The most important period in Ullberg's architect career is connected with the \\"White Era\\" of Functionalist architecture. However, some of his important works can be considered as marking a transition from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism during the 1920s and early 1930s. Ullberg found his own unique conception and interpretation of functionalistic architecture. The main aspect of his philosophy is the connection between the functional and the classical. In his early works Ullberg used as his basis Nordic Classicism, emphasizing reductive common elements from Classicism. The most important works of the era became Ullberg's reply to the serious social needs of the city. Among these works are the Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School (1930), the Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy Building (1931), the Viipuri Provincial Archives (1933), and the Viipuri Maternity Hospital (1937). Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School (1930) in Vyborg, Russia The most important of Ullberg's works is the combined Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School. Completed in October 1930, the building is situated near the 16th Century Pantsarlahti Bastion at the southern end of the city. Contrasting with its fortress surroundings, the white-stuccoed building commands the view over the South Harbour and the approach from the sea. The massing of the building comprises two wings (the Art Museum on the east wing, and the Drawing School on the west) placed at an angle to each other, with a wedge-shaped, paved courtyard separating the two. The wider part of the courtyard faces south-west, towards the harbour, and there is an imposing twin-row of Classical columns with a rectangular cross-section supporting an equally stylistic curving architrave, doubling as a corridor that connects the two buildings. The approach to the museum from the city is through a series of flights of steps leading to an opening, set at an angle, between the windowless north walls of the wings. The walls facing south are almost as austere, with the central colonnade acting as the focal point. Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy (1931) in Vyborg, Russia The four-storey building of the Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy was the first completed example of Functionalist movement in the city. It has as many rows of distinct, very simplified bands of windows, or rather, more like four very wide windows with very thin mullions. The first floor fenestration consists of a double row of windows, 22 in a row (that are hinged from the bottom, opening downwards), while the upper three only have one. The bold fenestration is enabled by the use of a solid reinforced concrete girderless framework with \\"mushroom form\\" columns that free the brick facade of its load-bearing function. The cross-section of columns on the last stage is much smaller than on the first one, it's because of the increase of mechanical tension down from the roof the basement. Ullberg was very successful in designing medical facilities. During the White Era he built a number of hospitals in Viipuri. In 1936 Ullberg moved to Helsinki where he became the head of the architectural bureau of the Finnish National Board of Health, and among his tasks was the planning of the Meilahti Hospital area, including the Children's Hospital, completed in 1946 after his death. Ullberg's most notable architectural design in Helsinki is Bensow House on Etel√§esplaadi, completed for the Bensow trading company. While on the outside the seven-storey building is typically Functionalist in its expression, in the interior it has numerous features typical of Art Deco, such as the use of chrome, brick tiles and neon signs. After the Winter War with the Soviet Union, and following a short period in 1941 when Vyborg was occupied by the Soviet Union, Vyborg was handed back to Finland, Ullberg quickly drew up a plan for the reconstruction for his native town, but there was no opportunity to implement the plan because the entire city was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1944. Ullberg died in Helsinki in 1944 at the age of 65. His gravestone at Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki was designed by Finnish architect and designer Alvar Aalto. An exhibition of the life and works of Uno Ullberg, titled UNO ULLBERG ‚Äì AN ARCHITECT FROM FINNISH VYBORG, was held at the Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki, in the summer of 2010.Uno Ullberg: An Architect from Finnish Vyborg, Museum of Finnish Architecture, 02.06.2020 - 23.08.2020.

It was originally bred by Iolo Owen in Angelsey by crossing Nelson Welsh Mountain sheep (a Welsh Mountain and Cheviot cross) which were crossed twice to the Wiltshire Horn, which is a wool-shedding breed. The progeny were selected for: wool shedding, no horns, and easy-care traits, reduced need for assistance at lambing, less flystrike and lameness. Some Easycare breeders are now selecting for sheep that need less worming. Most animals in the wild thicken up their coats in winter and then moult when spring comes, but many modern sheep breeds were selectively bred for thick coats which are retained for shearing. With the decline in the worldwide wool markets, a thick coat is now less desirable, especially where the cost of shearing is higher than the value of the wool produced. In this respect, the Easycare breed is an interesting reversal of centuries of practice in sheep breed development as the sheep naturally shed their coats in spring, a process called rooing. Unlike many other sheep breeds, Easycare sheep can live without the necessity of shearing.

The battle was fought between Tanaji Malusare, commander of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji. and UdayBhan Singh Rathore, a Rajput fortkeeper under Jai Singh I who worked for the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Sinhagad was one of the first forts which Chattrapati Shivaji re-captured from the Mughals. The capture was made possible by scaling the walls at night with ladders made of rope. A fight followed in which Tanhaji was killed but the fort was won. The battle and Tanhaji's exploits are still a popular subject for Marathi ballad. During the siege, Malusare scaled a steep cliff that led to the fort through the assistance of a monitor lizard called Yashwanti (also referred to as ghorpad in marathi). This type of lizard was tamed since the 15th century and Yashwanti was trained to pull the rope up the cliffs for Malusare and wind it around the fort's bastion. Climbing up the fort, the Marathas were intercepted by the garrison and combat ensued between the guards and the few infiltrators that had managed to climb up by this time. Udaybhan and Tanaji engaged in single combat. Udaybhan struck and broke Tanaji's shield to compensate for which he wrapped his turban cloth on his forearm and continued the battle, shortly afterwards Udaybhan cuts his forearm. But Tanaji fought him, which both were killed in the battle but the overwhelmed Maratha forces managed to capture the fort after the reinforcements penetrated the gateway of the fort from another route. It is said that when Shivaji got the information about the victory but Tanaji lost his life during the battle he exclaimed \\"Gad ala pan sinh gela\\" (The fort has been captured but we lost the lion). A bust of Tanaji Malusare was established on the fort in the memory of his contribution to the battle. The fort was also renamed Sinhagad to honor his memory.

Align three identical balls in a row to make them disappear. Screenshot of Big Twin Gameplay Big Twin may be played by one player, or by two players simultaneously. Each player uses an eight-way joystick and one button. Throughout the game, spheres of different colors, some with animal faces, fall from the top of the playfield. Players must align those spheres into rows of three of the same color, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Once a sphere has landed in the playfield, and if it is not blocked by another sphere, the player may highlight it and drag it to another location by holding the button and moving the joystick. =One-player mode= At the start of the game, the player may choose to start at level 1 (beginner), level 5 (expert) or level 10 (advanced). As matching spheres are eliminated, a photograph of a mostly nude woman is gradually exposed. After clearing a stage, the player receives a bonus for matches made and a penalty for any unmatched spheres. If the balls pile up to the top of the screen, the game will be over. The game features power-ups to aid in removing spheres. =Two-player mode= Each player has 100 items drop one at a time. When one player completes seven groups of three balls in a level, an additional row of six items will be dumped on the other player's side of the screen. The game is over when one player's items reach the top of the screen, at which point that player loses, or when all 100 items have been dropped, at which point the total scores are tallied and the winner is the player with more points.

In the mathematical field of symplectic topology, Gromov's compactness theorem states that a sequence of pseudoholomorphic curves in an almost complex manifold with a uniform energy bound must have a subsequence which limits to a pseudoholomorphic curve which may have nodes or (a finite tree of) \\"bubbles\\". A bubble is a holomorphic sphere which has a transverse intersection with the rest of the curve. This theorem, and its generalizations to punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, underlies the compactness results for flow lines in Floer homology and symplectic field theory. If the complex structures on the curves in the sequence do not vary, only bubbles can occur; nodes can occur only if the complex structures on the domain are allowed to vary. Usually, the energy bound is achieved by considering a symplectic manifold with compatible almost-complex structure as the target, and assuming that curves to lie in a fixed homology class in the target. This is because the energy of such a pseudoholomorphic curve is given by the integral of the target symplectic form over the curve, and thus by evaluating the cohomology class of that symplectic form on the homology class of the curve. The finiteness of the bubble tree follows from (positive) lower bounds on the energy contributed by a holomorphic sphere.

It was authorised as the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Stour Valley Railway in 1836; the title was often shortened to the Stour Valley Railway. The line opened in 1852, and the line is now the main line between those places. Associated with its construction was the building of the major passenger station that was later named New Street station, and also lines in tunnel each side of the station, connecting to the existing routes. The station was opened in 1854. Before completion, the Company became controlled by the London and North Western Railway, which used dubious methods to harm competitor railways that were to be dependent on its completion. The line was electrified in 1966 and now forms part of the Rugby‚ÄìBirmingham‚ÄìStafford Line an important and very heavily used part of the railway network. Origins The Stour Valley lineBirmingham's first main railway passenger terminal was Curzon Street station; it opened in 1838, although it was not given that name until 1852; at first it was simply the Birmingham station. The Grand Junction Railway opened to a temporary station at Vauxhall on 4 July 1837, approaching by curving round the north and north-west of the cityBirmingham did not become a city until 1889. by way of Bescot and Aston. Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 7: the West Midlands, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1973, 0 7110 6093 0, page 30 The London and Birmingham Railway opened to Curzon Street station from the south on 9 April 1838, completing its line to London on 24 June 1838. Through communication between London and Lancashire was achieved.Christiansen, page 37 The London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway were not always harmonious allies, and the L&BR; courted alternative means of connecting with the industries of Lancashire. However, on 1 January 1846 they, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, amalgamated to form the London and North Western Railway. Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 115 Birmingham was a major centre of industry and the workshops and manufactories of the district proliferated. The L&BR; and the GJR had been planned as inter-city railways, and numerous locations that had gained in importance now demanded rail connection. The GJR route passed more than a mile from Wolverhampton, although there was a Wolverhampton station. So it was that the LNWR projected a direct line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton.The planning had been done by the L&BR; in the previous year, before formal creation of the LNWR.Christiansen, page 103 Promoted in Parliament In the 1846 session of Parliament, the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Stour Valley Railway was promoted. Its concept had originally included a branch towards Stourbridge; this was now omitted, but the reference to the Stour in the title remained. In fact the Company was colloquially referred to as the Stour Valley Railway. The route was to run between a new central station at Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, joining the Grand Junction Railway at Bushbury, north of Wolverhampton. The line was to start in central Birmingham and run broadly north-west, following the Birmingham Canal, which had already attracted much industry to adjacent areas. This meant avoiding the Grand Junction Railway's sweep through Aston, and instead cutting through the high ground in central Birmingham. There was to be a Dudley branch, though this was not built in the form originally authorised. There were sixteen railways proposed in the immediate area in the 1846 session, and there was much controversy over which of them should be authorised. There was a strong body of opinion that only one line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton was justified. As well as the Stour Valley Railway, two other lines between Birmingham and Wolverhampton were proposed in the same session: the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway, taking a more northerly route, and joining the (proposed) Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway at Priestfield; and the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway. During the Parliamentary process the S&BR; was induced to omit the section of its line south of Wolverhampton, taking instead a one- quarter share in the Stour Valley Railway; the LNWR had a quarter, as did the Birmingham Canal; private investors collectively took the other quarter. Finally, despite the earlier presumption that only one connecting line was needed, both the Stour Valley Railway and the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway were authorised, on 3 August 1846.Grant, pages 48 and 49Carter, page 116M C Reed, The London & North Western Railway: A History, Atlantic Transport Publishers, Penryn, 1996, , page 43T R Perkins, The Railways of Wolverhampton: I: The Stour Valley and the Shrewsbury Lines, in Railway Magazine, July 1952 New Street station Birmingham New Street station in 1854The Stour Valley Railway would need a connection at the Birmingham end; this was authorised separately after considerable debate over the preferred site; opinion at first was that there would only be one main station. The station selected was what became New Street station, although that name was not used at first. It too was authorised on 3 August 1846, by the London and Birmingham Railway (Birmingham Extension) Act, which included nearly a mile of route from near Curzon Street, as well as the new station. The authorised capital was ¬£35,000. Donald J Grant, ‚Äò‚ÄôDirectory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain‚Äô‚Äô, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 35Christiansen, pages 41 to 43 Construction of the Stour Valley Line So the Stour Valley Line was authorised, with the LNWR, the Birmingham Canal and the S&BR; having large holdings. However an Act of 1846 gave the LNWR control of the Birmingham Canal Navigation company's system, so that the LNWR at once became the majority shareholder of the Stour Valley Railway. A further Act of 1847 permitted the LNWR to lease the (unbuilt) Stour Valley Line. The LNWR embarked on a prolonged and underhand attack on the S&BR;, which it saw as a competing line for Lancashire and Cheshire traffic that the LNWR wished to have exclusively. It purposely delayed completing the line, in order to disadvantage the S&BR;, which it now saw as a competitor for traffic for the north west. The S&BR; had opened its line as far as Wolverhampton on 12 November 1849, but was unable to get access to Birmingham.Christiansen, pages 80, 82 to 84 Perkins wrote in 1952, referring to the Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Shrewsbury and Chester companies: > [The LNWR] became the bitter enemy of both of the smaller systems, and > strove to crush them by every means in its power. The story is sordid and > remarkable, and it seems almost incredible that a great public institution > should have descended to such paltry devices to injure or destroy its > competitors. The Stour Valley line was practically complete in 1851, but the LNWR made no attempt to finalise the work or prepare it for opening. In response to an application to Parliament by the S&BR;, the LNWR announced that the Stour Valley Railway was ready for opening by 1 December 1852, but the LNWR refused the S&BR; access, on the grounds that the S&BR; had announced its intention to amalgamate with the GWR. It had not actually done so, merely announced the intention, but this gave the LNWR the opportunity to prevaricate. When judgment in Chancery was found against the LNWR, it refused to open the line to the S&BR;, stating that it would be unsafe, as certain safety undertakings had not been formalised by the S&BR.; The latter company then announced its intention of running a train anyway, on 1 December 1851. However the running powers held by the S&BR; were for the Stour Valley line, which did not include entry to New Street station, which was part of a separate construction, and the LNWR physically obstructed the running of the train.Christiansen, pages 104 to 106Reed, page 63 The S&BR; threatened a Parliamentary Bill to resolve the matter, and in February 1852 the LNWR opened the Stour Valley Railway to its own goods trains, and to passenger trains on 1 July 1852. Still the LNWR found reasons to exclude the running of S&BR; trains, and it was only on 4 February 1854 that this usage started. Opening of the Birmingham station The station was opened on 1 June 1854. The Midland Railway had been using Curzon Street and that company transferred its trains to the new station on 1 July 1854. On 14 November 1854 the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway opened for traffic. This was a rival scheme in GWR hands, and the S&BR;, now amalgamated with the GWR, transferred its trains to the friendly line, which used the GWR stations in both Wolverhampton and Birmingham. The Birmingham station was known at first by the title Navigation Street Station.S M Philip, New Street Station, Birmingham, in the Railway Magazine, April 1900 Some years before this the Midland Railway and the LNWR had both given guarantees of dividend to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. In time the B&GR; company was absorbed by the Midland Railway, and the LNWR guarantee remained as that company's obligation. On the opening of New Street station, an agreement was reached that the guarantee from the LNWR would be cancelled, and in return the Midland Railway was given access to New Street station. (It had been using Curzon Street station.) After opening The allegiance of the two lines between Birmingham and Wolverhampton was entirely polarised, the Stour Valley Line being in the LNWR group and the BW&DR; being a Great Western Railway line. Both had been formally leased or absorbed. The Stour Valley Line became an important trunk route, but it also served numerous communities and industrial centres in its short length. As Birmingham itself grew in importance, and as the residential districts and neighbouring towns grew in prosperity, the suburban traffic using New Street station expanded considerably. New Street Station widening New Street station in the late nineteenth centuryThe approach to Birmingham New Street station from the east became very congested, with the LNWR's own main line traffic, supplemented by that from the Aston lines, as well as the Midland Railway's use of the station. A scheme for widening the approaches was undertaken at the end of the nineteenth century, duplicating the tunnel section and diverting the Midland lines from Derby and Gloucester (via Camp Hill). This work was completed in May 1896. The Midland Railway had their own part of New Street station from 8 February 1885, and the entire station was made joint between the LNWR and the Midland Railway from 1 April 1897. Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, 2002 After 1923 The Stour Valley Line running parallel to the BCN New Main Line canal, crossing the BCN Old Main Line canal and then under the M5 motorway near SmethwickMost of the main line railway companies of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" following the Railways Act 1921, into one or other of four new large companies. The LNWR and the Midland Railway were constituents of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (the LMS), which from 1923 operated the Stour Valley Line and New Street station. In 1948 the railways were nationalised, following the Transport Act 1947 and British Railways were the new owner. Electrification and modernisation In the 1960s a major scheme of modernisation was undertaken on British Railways. Part of the scheme was the electrification at 25 kV overhead, 50 Hz, of the West Coast Main Line and certain branches. The main line itself came first, but electrification on the Rugby ‚Äì Coventry ‚Äì Birmingham ‚Äì Wolverhampton ‚Äì Stafford route followed. On 6 December 1966 the Birmingham ‚Äì Wolverhampton section was inaugurated. The Grand Junction route via Bescot had become important for freight, and as a diversionary route for through passenger services, and it too was electrified: Bescot ‚Äì Bushbury ‚Äì Stafford was opened to electric trains on 24 January 1966, and Stechford - Bescot on 15 August 1966. A major modernisation of Birmingham New Street station was undertaken as part of the work.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train, Ian Allan Publishing, Shepperton, 1988, , page 169 In the 1960s a number of branch lines had been closed as road-based passenger transport, and private car ownership, increased. It was considered useful to have an intermediate passenger railhead without entering the centres of Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and Oldbury station was selected for development. It was retitled Sandwell and Dudley, and opened on 14 May 1994. Selected main line trains called there.Gillham, page 170 The original connection between the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and the LNWR route at Wolverhampton had been closed in 1859, when the S&BR; was given a better route over the GWR line. In 1966 it was reopened for the electrification, giving access for Shrewsbury trains to Wolverhampton High Level station, and electric train access to the important carriage sidings at Oxley, on the S&BR; line.Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: volume 10: the West Midlands, David ST John Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1985, , page 40 New Street station in the twenty-first century Concourse at Birmingham New Street in 2019 The 1960s modernisation of Birmingham New Street station was considered by many to be unsatisfactory; the platform areas were dark and cold, and access to the platforms was congested. In 2006 Network Rail a regeneration scheme was announced, and work started in 2010. The shopping area above the station was extended and upgraded, and re-opened with the title Grand Central. It was completed in 2015. The new concourse is three times larger than the former, and is enclosed by a large atrium, allowing natural light throughout the station.Network Rail, New Street has seen significant changes in its history, at https://www.networkrail.co.uk/who-we-are/our- history/iconic-infrastructure/the-history-of-birmingham-new-street-station/ The present day Electrification in the 1960s meant concentration of all through passenger traffic on the Stour Valley route; most freight continued to use the Grand Junction Railway route via Bescot. There is a heavy passenger service on the Stour Valley line; twelve passenger trains are indicated in the Network Rail journey planner from Birmingham New Street to Wolverhampton in the hour from 11:00 to 11:59 on a weekday in June 2019.

Alexcee (his last name has also been spelled Alexie, Alexee, etc.) was born in Lax Kw'alaams, then known as Fort Simpson, in 1853. His father was an Iroquois laborer from eastern Canada who was in the employee of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Simpson. His mother was Tsimshian from the Giluts'aaw tribe, one of the \\"Nine Tribes\\" from the lower Skeena River area based at Lax Kw'alaams. In the matrilineal system of the Tsimshian, Alexcee followed his mother as a Giluts'aaw and as a member of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan or phratry). His Tsimshian name was 'Wiiksmwan, meaning Great Deer Woman. Alexcee was trained as a halaayt carver, the term halaayt referring to shamanic practices which were the prerogative of chiefs. He produced naxnox (spirit) paraphernalia and items for use in \\"secret society\\" ceremonies. All of these were practices which late-19th-century missionaries in Lax Kw'alaams were endeavoring to eradicate.

There were many different appliances, mostly cleaning based, produced, as well as a variety of other floor care products including handheld vacuum cleaners and carpet shampooing machines. There is also a division of Dirt Devil dedicated to central vacuums for homes and Recreational Vehicles. Company history The company was founded in 1905 in Cleveland, Ohio by Philip Geier as Royal Manufacturing. In 1955 they built the first household vacuum with a patented Cyclone system. Since then over 25 million have been sold. Originally the company made vacuum cleaners with metal cases. At around 1984, they began selling the mass-market \\"Dirt Devil\\" line with plastic cases; originally the packaging said \\"Royal Dirt Devil\\", but after a year or two, was called the Dirt Devil Broom Vac. This is the simple vacuum that made the company as well known as it is now. But over the years the name \\"Royal\\" appeared in smaller and smaller type, and a different font until it vanished entirely from the package. Today Dirt Devil is the main brand, but the company continues to manufacture the \\"Royal\\" line, as more expensive and of a higher quality product. The corporate legal name is the rather anonymous \\"TTI Floor Care North America\\". TTI stands for Techtronic Industries, a Hong Kong-based firm and the Hoover, Vax, and other vacuum cleaners. Products and marketing =Classic Red Hand Vac = In 1984 Royal introduced the Dirt Devil Hand Vac. It has a rotating brush for cleanup on stairs and furniture, plus a hose for hard to reach spots. The hand vac became the largest selling handheld vacuum in the United States, selling more than 25 million units, fueling innovation. In 1996 the Ultra Hand Vac was introduced with more suction and a built-in stretch hose and crevice tool. The Ultra Hand Vac is still available at some retailers and department stores. In 2005 Dirt Devil gave the hand vac a makeover calling it the Dirt Devil Classic Hand Vac. The Classic has twice the power of the classic red hand vac with a HEPA Filter and a bagless dirt cup. The Classic is available at various retailers. = Broom Vac = In 1987 the Broom Vac debuted. The original Dirt Devil Broom vac was a plastic bodied, metal handles, rear bagged quick pick up vacuum cleaner. They were very well known then, but most broke due to quality of materials used to manufacture it. Today, the original Broom Vac remains in some places, being preserved by collectors because of its rarity. The next Broom Vac after the corded model had finished production was a rechargeable stick vacuum used for mostly bare floors; the user sweeps with it and vacuums the pile; it does not require bags. In 2005 Dirt Devil came out with a completely different Broom Vac, with nine color options, longer battery life, and more suction. They are available at various retailers and department stores. =Vision Cyclonic= Includes Ultra Vision. = AccuCharge = Dirt Devil AccuCharge Handheld VacuumIn June, 2008, Dirt Devil introduced a line of cordless handheld vacuums with AccuCharge Technology. AccuCharge is the first cordless vacuum line that is Energy Star approved and reduces 70% in energy consumption compared to most cordless vacuums. The cordless hand vac & stick vac are the first in the AccuCharge lineup. The Dirt Devil AccuCharge Cordless Hand Vac and Cordless Stick Vac use 15.6 Volt Nickel Cadmium batteries. Charging time for both units is 6 hours. The Hand Vac has a unique flip-down crevice tool built into the nozzle and it weighs 3.25 lbs. The Stick Vac weighs 5.85 lbs and has a motorized brushbar that can be turned on or off. = Slogans = *\\"Nothing escapes the power of a Dirt Devil\\" (1995-2005) *\\"Fight Dirty\\" (2005‚Äì2014) *\\"Let's Go\\" (2013‚Äìpresent)  The UK Company  Dirt Devil UK is part of Pulse Home Products Ltd and develops upright, cylinder, and handheld vacuum cleaners for the UK and Ireland.

The indexes are produced monthly by the International Price Program (IPP) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Import and Export Price Indexes were published quarterly starting in 1974 and monthly since 1989.  History of the International Price Program  The origins of the International Price Program (IPP) can be traced to a 1961 report on Federal Price Statistics prepared by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The report for Congress' Joint Economic Committee suggested that indexes be assigned to a federal statistical agency \\"to obtain the attention and resources for these indexes that we believe are essential.\\"National Bureau of Economic Research, Price Statistics Review Committee. \\"Report on the Price Statistics of the Federal Government.\\" New York. 1961. A further study undertaken for NBER by Professors Irving Kravis and Robert Lipsey gave more impetus to the project. In their study, \\"Price Competitiveness in World Trade,\\" Kravis and Lipsey outlined the need for such measures and the feasibility of producing them.Kravis, Irving G., and Robert Lipsey. Price Competitiveness in World Trade. National Bureau of Economic Research, New York. 1971. During this time, the Bureau's Division of Price and Index Number Research began research on the feasibility of producing import and export price indexes. The IPP was a result of this research and was established as an ongoing program in 1971. The IPP produced its first annual international price indexes in 1973. Largely as a response to changing international economic conditions and the need on the part of both the Federal Government and the private sector to obtain these data on a more timely basis, collection and publication of international price indexes were begun on a quarterly basis in 1974. The IPP increased the commodity area coverage and detail of its indexes as more samples were initiated. In 1982 full coverage in the import and export goods categories was available and the Office of Management and Budget placed the IPP indexes on its list of Principal Federal Economic Indicators together with the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index. The IPP continued to expand by introducing selected services indexes. Various transportation services indexes were added to the IPP in the late 1980s. Research is continuing on other international services as data and resources become available. Beginning in 1989, BLS began producing a limited number of indexes on a monthly basis. With the release of March 1992 data, IPP added import locality of origin indexes, and in January 1993 began monthly publication of the major merchandise indexes.BLS Handbook of Methods, Chapter 15: International Price Indexes, Background section In 2005, the IPP expanded its output of import price indexes based on locality of origin to include France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Pacific Rim, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Asia Near East.McCulley and Swartz. 2005. \\"The IPP introduces additional Locality of Origin indexes. Monthly Labor Review.  Scope of the Export and Import Price Indexes  The target universe of the import and export price indexes consist of all goods and services sold by U.S. residents to foreign buyers (exports) and purchased from abroad by U.S. residents (imports). Items for which it is difficult to obtain consistent with time series core comparable products, however, such as works of art, are excluded. Products that may be purchased on the open market for military use are included, but goods exclusively for military use are excluded. Only selected services for transportation areas are included.  Data sources  Most of the relevant price data is collected by a fielded survey directed at U.S. importers and exporters. Respondent participation is voluntary, and cooperation of survey respondents in providing data is necessary for the Bureau to perform its responsibilities as mandated by Congress. The data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is strictly confidential. The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (Title 5 of Public Law 107-347) protects the confidentiality of the data provided by the respondents. Price data that is not received directly from survey respondents, referred to as secondary source data, is also used in the calculation of some indexes, including petroleum, ocean tanker freight, and grains indexes. The import merchandise sampling frames are obtained from the U.S. Customs Service. The export merchandise sampling frames are obtained from the Canadian Customs Service for exports to Canada and from the Bureau of the Census for exports to the rest of the world. Data sources for services are researched and developed separately for each category. For example, the Department of Transportation provides the sampling frames for the air freight price indexes. The reference period for a sampling frame is generally the most recent available 12 months. Calculation weights are derived from the dollar values found on the sampling frames and from trade dollar values compiled by the Bureau of the Census for the base year.  Calculating index changes  Movements of price indexes from one month to another usually should be expressed as percent changes, rather than as changes in index points, because the latter are affected by the level of the index in relation to its base period, while the former are not. Each index measures price changes from a reference period defined to equal 100.0. An increase of 20 percent from the base period in the Export Price Index, for example, is shown as 120.0, which can be expressed in dollars as follows: ‚ÄúPrices received by domestic producers of a systematic sample of finished goods have risen from $100 in the base period, December 2001, to $120 today.‚Äù Likewise, a current index of 133.3 would indicate that prices received by producers of export goods today are one-third higher than what they were in December 2001.

It was part of Spain's effort to colonize the region, and convert the Timucua and Apalachee people to Christianity. The mission served a local chiefdom of the Timucua people known as the Yustaga. It lasted until the first decade of the 18th century, when it was destroyed, possibly by Creek Indians and the English. The site where the mission stood was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1974. The archaeological site was first discovered and investigated by B. Calvin Jones between 1968 and 1972. Jones concluded that the site was that of San Miguel de Asile. More recent archaeological work and research by Alissa Slade casts doubt on Jones's theory. Slade's research indicates the site was not San Miguel de Asile, a Timucuan mission, but rather an Apalachee mission, possibly San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco.Slade, Alissa Marie (2006).

It is located between the Park Kultury and the Oktyabrskaya underground stations. The largest open-air sculpture museum in Russia, it has more than 700 artworks currently on display and another 200 in storage. The origins of the English- language exonym \\"Fallen Monument park\\" are unknown; Russian-language speakers either simply call the park the Sculpture Park of the Central House of Artists () or reference its legal title, Muzeon Park of Arts (Russian: –ü–∞—Ä–∫ –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤, Park Iskusstv - literally: \\"Park of the Arts\\"). History In 1923, the decision was made to build the All-Russia Agricultural and Industrial Craft Exhibition. The section for foreign pavilions‚Äî from Germany, Italy, and elsewhere‚Äîwas located on the current MUZEON site. In the middle, young architect Andrei Burov built a soccer stadium, unheard of back then. Vladimir Lenin visited the exhibition during his last trip to Moscow three months before his death. Lenin was driven in a car past pavilions designed by Konstantin Melnikov, Vladimir Shchuko, and Vera Mukhina, before departing for the estate of Gorki, where he died . The Krymsky Bridge, the first cablestayed bridge in the Soviet Union and one that continues to serve as a striking example of severe and precise architecture, was built under Stalin in 1938. Around the same time, the granite Krymskaya and Pushkinskaya embankments were laid down. Until the late 19th century, there hadn't been any embankments at all, just river banks reinforced with paving stones. During the Great Patriotic War, military hardware and anti-aircraft weapons were stationed near Krymsky Bridge, and by the late 1940s, a vast, empty space had appeared that became the city's largest snow-dumping ground. Architects proposed building everything from the Academy of Sciences to the Palace of the Soviets on the site, but Culture Minister Yekaterina Furtseva insisted on the Central House of Artists (CHA), which broke ground in 1965 amidst wooden shanties. The square around CHA was built in the 1980s. Muzeon Park was established by the City of Moscow in 1992 and currently displays over 700 sculptures. It is split into themed sections, i.e. the Oriental Garden, Pushkin Square, Portrait Row, although the best known part‚Äîthe fallen monuments themselves‚Äîappeared here before 1992. In October 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, smaller socialist realism statues of Soviet leaders and unidentifiable workers and peasants were removed from their pedestals, hauled to the park and left in their fallen form. They were rectified later, although missing original pedestals. In 1990s these statues shaped the park outline, but as more and more modern sculpture was added and as the young trees grew up, they became a less obvious minority. In the late 1980s, at the height of Perestroika, CHA began holding lavish exhibitions by artists such as Francis Bacon, Giorgio Morandi, Jannis Kounellis, Robert Rauschenberg, and James Rosenquist. Sculptures by Western modernists appeared in the adjacent park. The winds of change were blowing. On August 22, 1991, the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky was dismantled and brought to the park. The Communist Party was banned the next day. Busts of Lenin, and statues of Kalinin, Sverdlov, and Stalin from across Moscow started to pile up on the grass. Sculptures were brought in from shuttered sculpture factories, Soviet-era workshops where anonymous artisans manufactured figurines. In January 1992, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov signed a decree establishing the MUZEON Park of Arts. Gradually the statues were hoisted to their feet and arranged throughout the park. In the 2000s, the park began hosting symposiums for sculptors working with limestone; the sculptures they donated are displayed on a special square reserved for white-stone sculptures. The symposiums featured a wide range of subjects and participants, including professionals such as Fakhraddin Rzayev, Vladimir Buinachev, and Grigory Krasnoshlykov, as well as amateurs. MUZEON today Major changes have taken place at MUZEON since 2011. As part of a government program to boost Moscow's tourism and leisure infrastructure, architect Yevgeny Asse developed a new master plan, including a redesigned landscape, for MUZEON that has transformed the park into a dynamic and contemporary space. Makeshift and rickety structures were removed, and a diagonal, winding ‚Äúpromenade‚Äù path linking Krymsky Val and Bolotny Island was laid down. Footpaths were resurfaced with granite pavers. The ‚ÄúSchool‚Äù pavilion (designed by architects Igor Chirkin and Alexey Podkidyshev), where MUZEON's education programs are held, was opened. Today the park features easy navigation, decorative lighting, new cozy cafes, and an open-air cinema. In 2013, following the adoption of a plan by architecture firm ‚ÄúWowhaus‚Äù (Dmitry Likin and Oleg Shapiro) the Krymskaya Embankment was completely rebuilt and turned into a pedestrian area that stretches from the former ‚ÄúRed October‚Äù chocolate factory to the Sparrow Hills. Unique perennial flower beds were planted; unobtrusive obstacles for skateboarders and bike lanes were installed along with sleek benches and teardrop-shaped pavilions. A new ‚ÄúVernisazh‚Äù (art exhibition space) with undulating rooftops and spacious, brightly lit stands was built. A splash fountain, Moscow's second, has become a popular attraction. MUZEON has become not only a place for preserving historical artifacts, but also an open- air contemporary art museum, a special exhibition space, a music festival venue, and a massive creative workshop. Since July 13, 2019, a \\"\\" sculpture by the German artist Mia Florentine Weiss is in the sculpture park.http://www.epa.eu/arts-culture-and-entertainment-photos/arts-general- photos/mia-florentine-weiss-presents-ambigram-sculpture-in-moscow- photos-55340852 Famous sculptors = Vera Mukhina = Vera Mukhina was an iconic 20th-century artist and the most famous female sculptor from the Soviet Union.http://www.russia-ic.com/people/general/m/177/ Many know her as the artist behind ‚ÄúWorker and Kolkhoz Woman,‚Äù one of the century's most enduring symbols, but her creative path was much more complex than that. Mukhina herself was a complicated person: a semi-official sculptor and believer in the ‚Äúnew religion‚Äù (i.e. of the revolution), as well as a subtle artist who parted with illusions early on; a frosty maiden with expressionless eyes as well as a fragile woman who lived a dramatic life. Mukhina's connections theater found expression in the fine arts. Thus, ‚ÄúWe Demand Peace!‚Äù (1950), inspired by the conflict between North and South Korea, looks like a mise-en-sc√®ne: a masculine Russian soldier, dark-skinned youth with clenched fists, blind man, and a Korean mother holding a baby walk across the banners of a defeated army into a bright future behind a woman releasing a dove. Every contemporary clich√© is here; Mukhina's intention was to make a propagandistic sculpture. Art historian Mikhail Alpatov has called the work cold and contrived, arguing that the artist ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt communicate the idea of fighting for peace in the language of art, which would have allowed her express herself through her work.‚Äù Today, however, the sculpture is valuable for a different reason; it's an example of exuberant, semi-official art and an important monument to the era that produced it. Also of interest is the technique Mukhina used, electroplating, which reduced the statue's weight, making it easier to transport between cities and countries. = Yevgeny Vuchetich = Vuchetich was one of the first well-known sculptor in the Soviet Union to have received an exclusively Soviet education. Vuchetich was extremely prolific, sculpting dozens of official portraits of Soviet heroes. His sculptures are surely too numerous to be the work of one man, but it's unclear how many assistants he employed. All we know is that in the early 1960s, he invited sculptor Vadim Sidur to join him as an apprentice. Vuchetich's rise was swift. By the end of the Second World War, he had already received a commission to create a sculpture group honoring the late General Yefremov (completed in 1946) and been put in charge of designing the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin's Treptower Park. The story of the Yefremov monument is shrouded in mystery. Why on earth did Stalin suddenly decide to erect a monument to the fallen general, who died after his unit was surrounded by enemy troops? Weren't there many such generals? Why Yefremov? According to one theory, the choice was part of a post-war campaign against Marshal Zhukov, whom Stalin hoped to strip of his official posts. General Yefremov had been sent on a suicide mission by none other than Zhukov, and the statue seemed to be Stalin's way of publicly saying that Zhukov was evil for sending a brave general to his death.

History Adamasingba complex was built on 130,000 square meters of land, formerly occupied by Ibadan race course. It was open on 28 May 1988. Development plans for the complex began in 1976 during the administration of David Jemibewon. The race course space had gone unused and had been occupied by illegal structures and activities, to reclaim the land, the military government of Jemibewon decided to build a recreational and sports complex. While the initial design was for a sports and recreational complex, provision of additional facilities for shops was later added. At inception, the complex included a football field, tennis courts, squash court and indoor sports hall. Since it was opened, the facilities have been poorly maintained. The stadium was named Lekan Salami Stadium in 1998 in honour of Chief Lekan Salami by the Oyo State Military Governor Hammed Usman.

He is also often described as a Shaman, and is also a teacher and an actor. Life Born in the upper Altai Mountains in western Mongolia, the youngest son of a Tuvan shaman, Galsan majored in German studies at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig, East Germany (1962-1968). He did his thesis work under Erwin Strittmatter, and upon graduation began to work as a German teacher at the National University of Mongolia. In 1976 his teaching license was revoked because of his \\"political untrustworthiness\\". He continued to work twelve-hour shifts, shuttling between all four of the Mongolian universities. In 1980, at the age of 36, Galsan was diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition. He later recovered from the condition and credits his \\"shamanic powers\\" and plenty of exercise for saving his life. Today, the author spends most of the year at his home in the Mongolian capital city of Ulan Bator, together with his family of nearly 20. He also spends much time giving readings in the German-speaking world and across Europe, as well as seeking to get closer to his Tuvan roots in the western Mongolian steppes. Though he still writes mainly in German, his books have been translated into many other languages. In addition to his writing, Galsan is an activist for the Tuvan minority and practices shamanistic healing.

He supported the sabotage team that travelled to New Zealand and bombed and sank the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior, drowning photographer Fernando Pereira. He was apprehended by New Zealand police, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on 22 November 1985. Following heavy political pressure from France and her allies and a United Nations-sponsored mediation between New Zealand and France in July 1986, Mafart was deported to the island of Hao in French Polynesia to serve three years. In return, France apologised to New Zealand and paid New Zealand $6.5 million. However, on 14 December 1987, Mafart was returned to Paris after complaining of stomach pains. After treatment he was not returned to the island and in 1988 enrolled on a two-year course at the √âcole de Guerre (War College) in Paris. Mafart was promoted to colonel in December 1993. According to Le Monde, Mafart was then serving near Paris on a base housing several command staffs, including that of military intelligence. His commanding officer during the Rainbow Warrior affair became an aide to Defence Minister Francois L√©otard.

The school was opened in 1965 with principal Lindsay Young. In 1969, Harry Fletcher became principal, who held the position into the 1980s. The school was originally known as Croydon West High School until 1971, when the name was changed to Maroondah High School. The school entrance was on Brentnall Road in Croydon, and this site is now used as the main campus of Melba College. The College had an enrolment of approximately 590 students in its final year. It was part of the Maroondah Education Coalition. The school offered both VCE and VCAL programs to students, but with a limited range of subjects. Additionally they included the opportunity to complete TAFE certificates through the VCE Vocational Education and Training (VET) program. Two LOTE languages were offered at Maroondah, French and Japanese. The school had established a connection with Sasayama Homei Senior High School in Japan, who raised money for victims of the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009. Maroondah then returned the favour by donating $1500 to victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. A $750,000 VCE study centre and newly refurbished library was finished in late 2006. In 2007, the old science wing was re-furnished, modernised and equipped with smart whiteboards. There were two gyms, and a theatre. In September 1996 a 17-year-old student from Maroondah Secondary College, Daron Wilkinson, committed suicide. It was believed that a school inquiry into the integrity of Daron's assessment in VCE English contributed to his suicide. Following this, the school established a relationship with the Peer Support Foundation, an independent youth support group. Merger At the start of 2012, Maroondah Secondary College began a merger with Croydon Secondary College. In 2012, the two schools adopted the temporary name Croydon Maroondah College, but continued at independent campuses. In 2013, the schools officially merged to become Melba College. Until 2017, the former site of Maroondah Secondary College acted as the Senior Campus of Melba College. Since late 2017, all students reside at this site.

Early life Brydon was born in London of Scottish descent. He studied medicine at University College London and at the University of Edinburgh. Attack The British Army began its retreat from Kabul in January 1842, following the killing of the two British representatives there. The nearest British garrison was in Jalalabad, away, and the army would need to go through mountain passes with the January snow hindering them. Under the command of Major-General William George Keith Elphinstone, 4,500 British and Indian soldiers plus 12,000 civilian camp followers, including wives and children, set out for Jalalabad on 6 January 1842, on the understanding that they had been offered safe passage. Afghan tribesmen intercepted them and proceeded to attack them during the next seven days. Last stand of the 44th at Gandamak, painted by William Barnes Wollen The final stand took place at Gandamak on the morning of 13 January 1842 in the snow. Twenty officers and forty-five British soldiers, mostly of the 44th Foot, found themselves surrounded on a hillock. The Afghans attempted to persuade the soldiers that they intended them no harm. Then the sniping began, followed by a series of rushes. Captain Souter wrapped the regimental colours around his body and was dragged into captivity with a sergeant named Fair and seven privates. The remainder were shot or cut down. Surgeon Brydon was one of twelve mounted officers who had become separated from the remnants of the main column before the final stand at Gandamak. This small group had ridden to Futtehabad, but half had been killed there while six escaped. All but Brydon were killed, one by one, further along the road as their horses became exhausted.Robert Wilkinson-Latham, page 11 \\"North-West Frontier 1837‚Äì1947\\" On the afternoon of 13 January 1842, the British troops in Jalalabad, watching for their comrades of the Kabul garrison, saw a single figure ride up to the town walls. It was Dr Brydon. Part of his skull had been sheared off by an Afghan sword, and he survived only because he had stuffed a copy of Blackwood's Magazine into his hat to fight the intense cold weather. The magazine took most of the blow, saving the doctor's life. Dr. Brydon reaches Jellalabad alone Brydon became widely, if inaccurately, known as being the only survivor of the entire army. In fact, he was not the only European to survive the retreat; about 115 British officers, soldiers, wives and children were captured or taken as hostages and survived to be subsequently released.Linda Colley, page 350 \\"Captives ‚Äì Britain, Empire and the World 1600‚Äì1850\\" Included, was the wife of Sir Robert Henry Sale, Lady Sale, though not Elphinstone, who died in captivity. Nor was Brydon the only European to survive the trek from Kabul to Jalalabad without spending time in captivity; by Brydon's own account a \\"Greek merchant\\", a Mr Baness, also made it to Jalalabad, arriving two days after Brydon but surviving for only one day. In addition a small number of Indian sepoys reached Jalalabad on foot over the subsequent weeks. One sepoy, havildar Sita Ram, escaped from Afghanistan after 21 months of slavery and rejoined his former regiment at Delhi.Sita Ram pages 119‚Äì128 \\"From Sepoy to Subedar\\", About 2,000 sepoys and an unrecorded number of camp followers were eventually found in Kabul and brought back to India by Pollock's \\"Army of Retribution\\" following their occupation of the city. The episode was made the subject of a famous painting by the Victorian artist, Lady Butler, who portrayed Brydon approaching the gates of the Jalalabad fort perched on his exhausted horse (which, according to Brydon, collapsed and died when put in a stable after arrival in the city). The painting is titled Remnants of an Army. After attack Brydon fought in the Second Anglo- Burmese War of 1852, when Rangoon was taken. In the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, Brydon was a surgeon of the Bengal Army at Lucknow and, along with his wife and children, survived his second siege, that of the Lucknow residency (June ‚Äì November 1857), in which he was badly wounded in the thigh. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1858. His wife, Colina Maxwell Brydon, published a memoir of the siege. Brydon died at his home Westfield near Nigg in Ross-shire on 20 March 1873, and is buried in Rosemarkie churchyard alongside his brother-in-law Donald MacIntyre VC.Heroes ... and Others, Eric H Malcolm, Cromarty History Society, 2003, Sources * Claire E.

The fox is also sometimes associated with transformation. This folkore is found in literature, film, television, games, and music, and elsewhere. The term \\"foxy\\" in English (\\"having the qualities of a fox\\") can also connote attractiveness, sexiness, or being red-haired. The term \\"to outfox\\" means \\"to beat in a competition of wits\\", similarly to \\"outguess\\", \\"outsmart\\", and \\"outwit\\". In folklore and wisdom =Africa= In Dogon mythology, the fox is reported to be either the trickster god of the desert, who embodies chaos or a messenger for the gods. There is a Tswana riddle that says that \\"Phokoje go tsela o dithetsenya [Only the muddy fox lives] meaning that, in a philosophical sense, 'only an active person who does not mind getting muddy gets to progress in life.' =Europe= Kuma Lisa is a female fox from Bulgarian folklore and Russian folklore who usually plays the role of the trickster. Kuma Lisa is encountered with another character known as Kumcho Vulcho - a wolf which is opposite to her and very often suffers from her tricks. In Scotland, the trickster figure of the fox (or tod in traditional Scots) was represented as Lowrence, as in the Morall Fabillis of Robert Henryson. In Finnish mythology, the fox is depicted usually a cunning trickster, but seldom evil. The fox, while weaker, in the end outsmarts both the evil and voracious wolf and the strong but not-so-cunning bear. It symbolizes the victory of intelligence over both malevolence and brute strength. In Northern Finland, the fox is said to conjure the aurora borealis while it runs through the snowy hills. When the fox‚Äôs fur touches the snow it creates magical sparks and sets the sky ablaze. Still today, the Finnish word for the aurora is ‚Äúrevontulet‚Äù which literally translates to ‚Äúfox-fires‚Äù. An Occitan song dating from the Middle Ages, Ai Vis lo Lop, features a wolf (lo lop), a fox (lo rainard) and a hare (lebre) dancing and circling a tree. It has been suggested that the three animals represent the King, Lord and Church who were responsible for taxation (the lyrics go on to refer to money gained over the year and how nothing was left after seeing 'the wolf, the fox and the hare'). In Europe, in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, foxes, which were associated with wiliness and fraudulent behavior, were sometimes burned as symbols of the Devil. = Greece = In the ancient Greek story of the Teumessian Fox, the god Dionysus sends a giant fox as punishment to eat the children of Thebes. To defend the children, Creon, the leader of Thebes, sends a dog with special powers to catch the giant fox. Zeus then intervenes and turns both animals into stone and throws them into the sky, where they become the constellations Canis Major and Canis Minor. =Middle East= In early Mesopotamian mythology, the fox is one of the sacred animals of the goddess Ninhursag. The fox acts as her messenger. The Bible's Song of Solomon (2:15) includes a well-known verse \\"Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom\\" which had been given many interpretations over the centuries by Jewish and Christian Bible commentators. To the Jewish sage Matteya ben Heresh, of the 2nd century CE, is attributed the maxim: \\"Meet each man with friendly greeting; be the tail among lions rather than the head among foxes\\". \\"The head among foxes\\" in this context is similar to the English expression \\"A big fish in a small pond\\". \\"Fox fables\\" are attributed to Rabbi Meir and Johanan ben Zakai, and appeared in a large compilation by Berechiah ha-Nakdan; the term in fact refers also to fables featuring animals other than foxes. =East Asia= Prince Hanzoku terrorized by a nine-tailed kitsune (fox spirit). Print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi, 19th century. In Classic of Mountains and Seas (edited by Liu Xiang in Han Dynasty and probably composed by people before Qin Dynasty), foxes eat people, and predicts war. In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean folklores, foxes (huli jing in China, kitsune in Japan, and kumiho in Korea) are powerful spirits that are known for their highly mischievous and cunning nature, and they often take on the form of female humans to seduce men. In contemporary Chinese, the word huli jing is often used to describe a mistress negatively in an extramarital affair. In Shinto of Japan, kitsune sometimes helps people as an errand of their deity, Inari. =Americas= The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the fox in their art.Katherine Berrin & Larco Museum (1997). The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueol√≥gico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson. The Moche people believed the fox to be a warrior that would use his mind to fight. The fox would not ever use physical attack, only mental. In the Uncle Remus collection of 19th-century African-American folktales adapted and compiled by Joel Chandler Harris, \\"Br'er Fox\\" is a major character, often acting as the antagonist towards the stories' main character, \\"Br'er Rabbit\\". In language =As an epithet= The Medieval Norman adventurer Robert Guiscard was nicknamed \\"Robert the Fox\\" as well as the Resourceful, the Cunning, the Wily - underlining the identification of such qualities with foxes. During the American Revolution Continental Army Officer Francis Marion became so adept at attacking and Ambushing British forces in the swamps of South Carolina that he became known as the ‚ÄúSwamp Fox‚Äù. During World War II, the German commander in North Africa, Erwin Rommel, was grudgingly nicknamed the \\"Desert Fox\\" by his British adversaries, as a tribute to his cunning and skill in operational art. The Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848‚Äì1923) in his Trattato di Sociologia Generale (1916) developed the concept of an elite social class, which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the power constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa. =Figures of speech= The words fox and foxy have become slang in English-speaking societies for an individual (most often female) with sex appeal. The word vixen, which is normally the common name for a female fox, is also used to describe an attractive woman‚Äîalthough, in the case of humans, \\"vixen\\" tends to imply that the woman in question has a few nasty qualities. The word shenanigan (a deceitful confidence trick, or mischief) is considered to be derived from the Irish expression sionnachuighim, meaning \\"I play the fox.\\" Literature  :(in chronological order) obake karuta (monster card) from the early 19th century depicts a kitsune (fox spirit). The associated game involves matching clues from folklore to pictures of specific creatures * 4 BC - Aesop's Fables from classical antiquity, contain numerous tales involving a fox. * 800 - \\"Renshi zhuan\\" (‰ªªÊ∞è‰º†) [The story of Lady Ren] by Shen Ji-ji,: Story of a love affair between Zheng and a were-fox named Ren. * 921 - Kuzunoha: Abe no Seimei's mother is a kitsune (fox spirit) named Kuzunoha * 1100 - The medieval story of Reynard, a classic anthropomorphic epic. * 1390s - Geoffrey Chaucer, The Nun's Priest's Tale, based on an incident in the Reynard cycle. * 1480s ‚Äì Robert Henryson, The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian, where the figure of the fox, as Lowrence, is portrayed in an ongoing rivalry with the wolf. * 1532 - Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Prince: The successful prince must have the traits of both the lion and the fox.

A tale with a fox as antagonist that bears striking similarities to Robert Southey's \\"The Story of the Three Bears\\" was uncovered by the folklorist Joseph Jacobs and may predate Southey's version in the oral tradition. Some sources state that it was illustrator John D. Batten who in 1894 reported a variant of the tale at least 40 years old. In this version, the three bears live in a castle in the woods and are visited by a fox called Scrapefoot who drinks their milk, sits in their chairs, and rests in their beds. * 1905? - Ernest Thompson Seton, The Biography of a Silver-Fox, Or, Domino Reynard of Goldur Town: Realistic story with author's drawing, later made into a feature film. * 1909 - L.

Prieur was also the first female French secret agent.  Biography  Prieur joined the military in 1974 and was recruited as a secret agent in August 1977. = Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior = Prieur worked in the intelligence-gathering and evaluation wing of the French Secret Service, the Direction G√©n√©rale de la S√©curit√© Ext√©rieure (DGSE). She was an expert in European peace organisations and was the controller for Christine Cabon. Cabon was posted to Auckland in April 1985, where she infiltrated the Greenpeace office and gathered information for Prieur and her fellow agent Alain Mafart. In July 1985, Prieur and Mafart entered New Zealand from Corsica on Swiss passports issued to their aliases Sophie and Alain Turenge, a newlywed couple on honeymoon. Their instructions were to sink the Rainbow Warrior as the French government suspected that it would be used to protest the upcoming nuclear tests at Mururoa atoll in the South Pacific. Prieur's responsibilities were the logistics of the operation, and the evacuation of the agents from the country after the bombing had taken place. Prieur and Mafart delivered limpet mines to two frogmen to plant on the ship's hull on the night of 10 July 1985. The explosions sank the vessel and killed photographer Fernando Pereira. They were arrested by New Zealand police within 30 hours of the bombing, and originally charged with Pereira's murder. Prieur was transferred to Christchurch Women's Prison and held there awaiting trial. Prieur pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter and wilful damage in the Auckland District Court, and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on 22 November 1985. After serious political pressure from France and her allies, the New Zealand government agreed to a United Nations arbitration ruling in July 1986 that saw the pair transferred to French custody on the island of Hao in French Polynesia. Prieur's husband, Joel Prieur, an employee of the Defense Department, was posted to Hao shortly after she was exiled there. On 6 May 1988 she was returned to France because she was pregnant, and was heralded as a national hero. She never returned to Hao. Although a UN Arbitration panel found that France had breached its obligation to New Zealand several times by removing the agents from Hao, and failing to return them, it rejected the claim by New Zealand to have Mafart and Prieur returned because the term they should have spent there had already lapsed. = Later career = In 1989, Prieur was promoted to Major, and by 2002 she had been promoted to the rank of Commandant. Prieur published a book \\"Agent secr√®te\\" (Secret Agent) in 1995 concerning her role in the bombing. With regards to the death of Pereira, she wrote \\"We were terrified and appalled ... We hadn't come here to kill anyone.\\" In 2005, Prieur and Marfart appealed to the New Zealand Supreme Court to stop footage of their guilty pleas being shown on television. The supreme court allowed the footage to go on the air. In 2009, Prieur was hired as the director of human resources for the Paris Fire Brigade, a unit of the French Army.Staff (4 January 2009) \\"Fresh Start for Saboteur\\" Sunday Mail (South Australia) p. 29 References Category:Living people Category:French spies Category:1949 births Category:Directorate-General for External Security Category:Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior Category:Human resource management people Category:Women in firefighting Category:Terrorism committed by France Category:Paris Fire Brigade Category:French Army officers fr:Dominique Prieur ","title":"Dominique Prieur"},{"id":"6657512","text":"Stade Demba Diop is a multi-use stadium in greater Dakar, Senegal.

The thirteenth of these prophets was Zoroaster and the last was Sasan V, the alleged author of the Dasatir.

Randomized trials of laparoscopic vs open inguinal hernia repair have demonstrated similar recurrence rates with the use of mesh and have identified that chronic groin pain (>10%) surpasses recurrence (<2%) and is an important measure of success. Chronic groin pain is potentially disabling with neuralgia, parasthesia, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia. Patients may be unable to work, have limited physical & social activities, sleep disturbances, and psychologic distress. The management of inguinodynia is a difficult problem for many surgeons and 5‚Äì7% of patients experiencing post-hernia repair groin pain litigate.  Cause  Neuropathic pain is defined as pain in the sensory distribution of an offended nerve. This may be due to preexisting stretch injury or intraoperative nerve injury. It is often described as stabbing and burning. Nociceptive pain includes somatic and visceral pain. Somatic pain may be due to chronic inflammation from tissue injury and is described as gnawing, tender, and pounding. Visceral pain can manifest as testicular and ejaculatory pain which may be associated with mesh ingrowth into spermatic cord structures.  Prevention  = Nerves management = Avoiding nerve entrapment and injury is critical. The current consensus is that routine identification and preservation of nerves is the best method for prevention. Transection of the nerves routinely is not a recommended strategy, as it can sometimes increase the pain further. It also increases sensory disturbances in the area of distribution of the transected nerve. No identification at all is the worst, and many surgeons are not making this identification. For example, in daily practice, surgeons identify all three inguinal nerves as three single nerves in less than 40% of the cases, while the literature shows that this identification can be done in 70-90% of the cases. The challenge is that the course of both ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves is found to be consistent with that described in anatomical texts in only 42% of patients. However, these anatomical variations are readily identifiable. = Mesh = Method of fixation has also been hotly debated with varying results reported with few consistent findings of decreased long term groin pain. However, fibrin glue seems to have a slight advantage. Types of mesh have also been studied, suggesting a small advantage for lightweight over heavyweight, and for biologic mesh over synthetic. = Hernia sac = The role of hernia sac ligation is also being discussed. When ligation and excision of the sac is omitted, there is less reported short-term post-operative pain. However, the impact of this omission on long-term pain has not been widely studied so far.  Treatment  = Nonsurgical management = Evaluation and treatment can be very challenging in this patient population. Exam and imaging to exclude occult recurrence is important. Following that, use of antiinflammatories, nerve blocks, neuromodulators, and pain clinic referrals should be considered. Unless there is evidence of a recurrence, operative intervention should be deferred for at least 1 year since groin pain decreases with time elapsed from surgery. = Triple neurectomy and/or mesh removal = If operative repair is chosen, mesh excision +/- triple neurectomy may be considered with small studies suggesting good outcomes. The largest series encompassing 415 patient, most following open or suture repair, demonstrates significant improvement following triple neurectomy. However, standard triple neurectomy does not address inguinodynia secondary to neuropathy of the genitofemoral nerve and the preperitoneal segment of its genital branch. But extension of the standard triple neurectomy to include the genitofemoral nerve has given good results, on a small series of 16 patients. Mesh removal should only be considered in last resort. Meshes are easy to place but difficult to remove, due to their incorporation inside the peritoneum. Other algorithms proposed have included diagnostic laparoscopy at the start for evaluation of adhesions, removal of mesh, and repair of any recurrences. If there is no improvement then a staged procedure to remove mesh and neurectomy may be considered.  Prognosis  Chronic groin pain is more common than recurrence, and it may be lower following laparoscopic hernia repair. Pain often resolves with conservative measures. Following complete evaluation of patient and attempts at non surgical treatment, surgery may be considered. Various treatment algorithms exist with promising results.  Incidence  The true incidence is difficult to determine, pain having a subjective component. A prospective series of open Lichtenstein (419 patients) noted that at 1 year followup, 19% of patients had pain, 6% with moderate or severe degree. Predictors of moderate or severe pain included: recurrent hernia, high pain score at 1 week postop, and high pain score at 4 weeks postop. A Scottish population based study of 4062 patients identified at 3 months postop an incidence of 43% mild pain and 3% severe or very severe pain. The severe and very severe group was associated with young age and female gender. A further survey of the 3% severe pain cohort (at a median of 30 months) found that 29% resolved, 39% improved and 26% continued with severe, or very severe pain. A followup of a randomized study of 750 laparoscopic vs. open hernia repair followed patients‚Äô pain scores at 2 and 5 years post hernia repair via questionnaire. At 2 years, the chronic pain rate was 24.3% (lap) vs. 29.4% (open), and at 5 year follow up it was 18.1% (lap) vs. 20.1% (open). At 5 years, 4.3% in lap group and 3.7% in open group had attended a pain clinic. A larger and more recent study which was a followup at 5 years of 1370 from a randomized study of TEP vs. open repair demonstrated lower pain rates in the laparoscopic group (10% vs. 20%). Inguinodynia symptoms decreased over time, even in those in the moderate to severe pain group. In addition, when an inguinal pain questionnaire was administered to these individuals at a median followup of 9.4 years, physical ability was affected more in the open repair group. Predictors of chronic pain in the TEP group included Body Mass Index ‚â§ 3rd quartile (OR: 3.04), difference in preop and postop physical testing (OR: 2.14) and time to full recovery exceeding the median (OR: 2.09). In the open group, the only association was noted with postoperative pain score exceeding the third quartile (OR: 1.89 ). Use of mesh-based repair vs. suture-based repair has also been discussed. Some results suggest less inguinodynia after Shouldice (suture) than Lichtenstein (open mesh) for young men. Other studies find equal results between Shouldice and laparoscopic TEP. It must be recalled that the experience of the surgeon critically impacts the results, especially for Shouldice and laparoscopic repairs, which are fairly technical operations.

He made his first appearance in the show on 9 October 2003. On 21 April 2009 it was revealed that Tittensor had been released from Emmerdale because of a conviction of grievous bodily harm. Following a meeting with the show's bosses, the decision was taken to terminate Tittensor's contract after almost six years with the soap, due to the serious nature of the charge. Creation and development Daz came to Emmerdale in 2003 and introduced himself to Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) as his half-brother after his mother, Denise (Andrina Carroll), went on holiday with her latest boyfriend and left Daz home alone. Andy, however, initially refused to believe they were related as he hated his biological father Billy Hopwood (David Crellin). He only believed Daz's story when Billy confirmed it. It was clear Daz needed someone so Andy and his girlfriend Katie (Sammy Winward) took him in. During his time on show, the character has developed and grown up, dividing his time between Butler's Farm and the village. Storylines Daz was initially a troublemaker as he had a history of stealing cars but tried to make amends with community service. Unfortunately, things didn't go according to plan. Katie used this to her advantage when she threatened Daz that if he told Andy about her affair with Robert, she would make sure that he went back into care. Daz ignored her and told Andy regardless so Katie carried out her threat after persuading Andy that Daz was lying. However, after learning the truth when Katie left Andy for Robert, he visited Daz and persuaded him to return to the farm. Initially it was just Andy and Daz but needing money, Andy allowed Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) and his daughter, Debbie (Charley Webb), to move in. Daz got involved in Cain's schemes but a more serious problem was soon discovered. Andy and Debbie were having a relationship but kept it secret. When Cain found out, he told Andy to end the relationship or he would lead Daz astray. Wanting to protect Daz, Andy ended his relationship with Debbie, unaware that she was pregnant. Daz discovered Debbie's secret, weeks before the baby was due to be born. When she phoned, Daz found her in Seth Armstrong's (Stan Richards) old hide and almost delivered baby Sarah. He offered to stand by Debbie and Sarah but Debbie said no so Daz settled for being friends. For the first time in his life, Daz felt he had someone he could love unconditionally and was bereft when Debbie gave Sarah away. Daz didn't want anything to do with Debbie but this was difficult as they were both friends with Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman). Daz had a crush on Jasmine and was horrified to discover that she and Debbie were dating. Meanwhile, at home, there were more problems. He and Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) almost died after falling down an old mine shaft. Thankfully they were found and after a brief stay in hospital, given the all-clear and sent home. Daz finally felt loved, secure and settled at Butler's Farm until Andy‚Äôs wife, Katie (Sammy Winward), returned. Everything fell apart as Daz couldn't believe Andy would forgive Katie and take her back so he demanded that Andy choose - him or Katie. Andy chose Katie and Daz stayed with Jack and Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen). Jack was happy to have Daz permanently but Diane was recovering from colon cancer and didn't feel she could cope with two teenagers. Jack suggested they adopt Daz but Diane said no and insisted he return to Butler's Farm. Daz, however, wasn't happy with this. Andy might have forgiven Katie but Daz hadn't and he made sure she knew that. Following a heated argument, he kissed her and horrified, she pushed him away. He apologised and they agreed to forget it ever happened but Jo Stiles (Roxanne Pallett), Andy and Katie's lodger, saw them. She knew Katie wanted her to leave and threatened to tell Andy about her and Daz kissing unless Katie agreed she could stay. Denise (now Lisa Parry) returned to the village and swearing she had reformed, asked Daz to move back in with her. Feeling guilty about kissing Katie, Daz agreed. Andy was upset by his departure but Daz returned a couple of months later with Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson). Diane phoned Denise to let her know Daz was safe and tried to help them reconcile. Denise visited but demanded Daz make amends to her boyfriend, fearing he'd leave, so Diane threw her out. She and Jack then started adoption proceedings. While Denise seemed happy to allow it, his father - Billy Hopwood (David Crellin) - wasn't. He opposed the adoption as he felt the Sugdens had already stolen one of his sons, he wasn't prepared to let them have both. On his release from prison, Billy moved to the village. He got a job with King & Sons and moved into Edna Birch's (Shirley Stelfox) spare room. He tried to build relationships with Andy and Daz but Andy made it clear that Jack was his father. He also tried to make amends with Viv Hope (Deena Payne), Kelly Windsor (Adele Silva) and Donna Windsor-Dingle (Verity Rushworth). Jack was unhappy about Billy having contact with Daz, even after he saved Victoria Sugden's (Isabel Hodgins) life, but Daz and Billy bonded as father and son, regardless. Daz even took baby Sarah to see him when she returned to the village but Andy was angry and made Daz promise not to do it again. Unfortunately, Daz's relationship with Billy was damaged when he found out that Billy was having an affair with Diane. When Victoria accidentally set fire to the house, injuring herself, Billy and Jack, Billy rescued Andy and Jack. All three were taken to hospital and made full recoveries. Needing a clean break, Billy discharged himself and left the area, moving to Sheffield. Following the fire, the Sugdens moved into Butler's Farm with Andy, Jo and Sarah. Unfortunately overcrowding meant Daz decided to move in with Sam Dingle and his infant son, as he needed a lodger. He and his girlfriend, Penny Drury (Amelia Sefton), were happy as they had more room and fewer adults supervising them. Everything was fine until Samson found a vodka and coke and drank it so Sam rushed him to hospital. Luckily, he was fine but Daz asked Penny to apologise to Sam. She refused and called Sam names so Daz ended their relationship. Daz was happy to stay single but Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey-Beth Crossley) had other ideas. They met in early 2007 when she and her mother, Carrie (Linda Lusardi), moved to the village so Scarlett could get to know her half-brothers. Scarlett fancied him instantly and Daz found out when she made him a CD of what she thought were his favourite songs. Victoria had helped Scarlett with it but didn't tell her that she was friends with Penny and did it as a practical joke. When Scarlett found out, she ran off and Daz went after her, telling her that he was flattered but was dating Penny and made both girls apologise. When Scarlett and Daz did get together, just after Scarlett's 16th birthday, Jimmy felt Daz wasn't good enough and that Scarlett was too young for boyfriends but Lexi talked him round. When Sam moved back in with the Dingles', Scarlett suggested she move in but Daz wasn't ready for that and asked his best mate, Jake Doland (James Baxter), to move in instead. Together, they made sure that Scarlett wouldn't want to move in and it worked, thanks to some advice from Lexi. In early 2008, Jack went to Spain to look after his mother and Andy was in prison. Daz helped Jo on the farm but was unaware that a former inmate, who Andy had annoyed, was blackmailing her. He threatened to have Andy harmed if she didn't do as he said and even threatened Sarah. Jo told Debbie, who - aided by Chas and the McFarlanes - made sure that Charlie would never return to Yorkshire. Unfortunately Jo's problems continued on Andy's release, when he started beating her. By autumn 2008, Andy's abuse had been exposed, but Daz refused to believe Jo, supporting Andy until he saw Andy threaten her. Horrified and disgusted, Daz turned against him. Weeks later, when Andy tried to see Jo, he and Daz argued, leading to him punching Andy. Daz was scared as he worried he was turning into Andy and his father. In December, Andy began to convince Daz he had changed. Daz was suspicious but couldn't prove anything. He was proved right when Lee Naylor caught Andy sabotaging farm equipment so Jo would ask him to mend it. During this time, Daz and Victoria became closer and kissed on Christmas Day 2008. Both felt guilty, as they were practically siblings, and were awkward around each other. Later that day, he and Victoria were on the lake when the ice cracked and Victoria fell in. Daz jumped in, looking for her, and pulled her out of the lake. He performed CPR, desperately trying to save her and succeeded. They were taken to hospital and kept in overnight. Later, Victoria told him she had seen a dead body in the lake. They found the body (Shane Doyle) a few days later and a police enquiry was launched. On 5 February 2009, Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier) phoned The Woolpack, informing them of Jack's death. Daz was devastated to lose the father figure he loved and respected. He was one of the pallbearers at Jack's funeral. When Annie revealed that Jack had wanted Andy to take over as head of the family, he moved into Butler's Farm with Andy, who also reclaimed his daughter from the Dingles. At this point, Victoria decided to live with Annie in Spain. This upset Daz and the night of the funeral, Daz said he couldn't imagine life in the village without her and would miss her too much. She asked what their relationship was and he told her he wasn't sure. He was thrown by the chemistry between them, just as she was, but knew the village saw them as brother and sister. Encouraged by what Daz had said, Victoria agreed to move into Butler's Farm too. In April, Daz took Victoria out for a drive in a sports car as a birthday present. It was meant to be Scarlett, Daz and Victoria but the car was a two-seater so Scarlett insisted Daz take Victoria. Daz suggested sending the car back but Scarlett wouldn't hear of it. Following a row, after they got lost, Daz and Victoria slept together in a deserted barn. Victoria was thrilled, thinking she and Daz were a couple now but Daz told her that he wasn't going to dump Scarlett. He felt guilty about cheating on Scarlett and told Victoria that it was a mistake and they should forget about it. Victoria hoped Daz would change his mind but when he didn't, Victoria told him that she was pregnant, just as he and Scarlett were going away for a weekend. The weekend was a disaster as he kept thinking of Victoria and on his return, Daz took Victoria for a drive. He told Victoria that she'd have to see a doctor and that people would think he was a pervert if they announced that she was expecting his baby, so Victoria admitted she'd lied. Furious, Daz moved back into Dale View with Jake. Knowing Daz would be annoyed, Victoria reconciled with Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller). In May, Aaron and Victoria slept together and, thinking Daz and Jake would be at work, she \\"borrowed\\" Jake's keys and took Aaron to Dale View. Unfortunately Daz and Scarlett went home for lunch and found them there. Angry, Daz went for Aaron and trying to stop them fighting, Victoria blurted out that Daz didn't want her any more, making Aaron and Scarlett realise Daz and Victoria's relationship was more than brother/sister. Horrified, Daz tried to repair the damage but Aaron and Scarlett didn't want to know. Scarlett rushed home in tears and Aaron told Andy about Daz and Victoria's new relationship. Disgusted, Andy threw Daz out, ordering him to leave and never return. Daz was reluctant but felt he had no choice and left with only Jake to see him off. He stopped at the farm, perhaps wanting to see Victoria but didn't stay, not wanting to risk seeing Andy. On 9 June, on Diane's return to the village, she asked about Daz but was told he had decided he wanted a change of scene and had left the village.

Professional career After graduation in 1982, Minnifield joined the Chicago Blitz (later the Arizona Wranglers) of the USFL. He successfully sued the Wranglers for the right to move to the NFL, and signed as a free agent with the Browns in 1984. Minnifield became a fixture at cornerback for Cleveland and was named to the Pro Bowl four straight years from 1986 to 1989.

The initial accident was caused by: * over-reliance on signals and block working as allowing high-speed running even in adverse conditions * systematic signal failure in the adverse conditions of that day due to a vulnerability to accumulation of snow and ice The accident (and the subsequent inquiry into it) led to fundamental changes in British railway signalling practice. Overview A coal train preceding the Flying Scotsman on the main East Coast up (south-bound) line was normally scheduled to be shunted into a siding at Abbots Ripton to allow the much faster Flying Scotsman to pass. Because of a very bad snowstorm, both the coal train and the Flying Scotsman were running late and the signalman at Holme, the next station north of Abbots Ripton, judged that the coal train needed to go into sidings at Holme if it was not to delay the Flying Scotsman. He therefore set his signal levers to danger so as to stop the coal train, but it continued on the main line until it reached Abbots Ripton, where as expected the signalman waved it on to his box with a hand lamp, and directed it to shunt. The goods train had nearly completed shunting into the Abbots Ripton siding when the Scotch express ran into it at speed. The wreckage obstructed the down (northbound) line and a second collision occurred some minutes later when a northbound express to Leeds crashed into the wreckage. Thirteen passengers died in the collisions, and 53 passengers and 6 traincrew members were injured. The Great Northern was operating on the block system, which was supposed to eliminate such accidents, so the accident caused considerable alarm. It was soon established that the main problem was with signals and snow: * the weight of snow on the semaphore arm and/or snow and ice on the wires by which the arm should be moved had meant that when signalmen had put levers to the 'danger' position from the normal 'all clear' the signals did not fully move to 'danger' * in normal conditions, signalmen could see the signals they were controlling ‚Äì in a snowstorm they could not The coal train had therefore seen nothing to make it stop at Holme, and the Flying Scotsman whilst catching up with it had run through a number of signals which were showing 'clear' although their levers had been set to 'danger'. Narrative =Great Northern Railway equipment and practices= Geography Abbots Ripton is about north of Huntingdon (and south of Peterborough ) on the East Coast main line, which handled both fast passenger trains and slow goods (largely coal) traffic. North of Peterborough passenger and coal traffic took different routes. South of Peterborough, they shared the same route; this was twin track in 1876, but stations with 'shunting sidings' were provided at frequent intervals to avoid slow goods trains, typically travelling at , obstructing fast trains such as the prestigious 'Scotch express', which averaged (hence its unofficial nickname 'The Flying Scotsman'), A slow train being caught up by a faster one would stop at such a station and reverse into the shunting siding, taking about four minutes to clear the main line. After the fast train had passed, the slow train would resume its journey. Abbots Ripton station had a shunting siding; for a south-bound ('up') train the previous siding was further north at Holme, south of Peterborough. Block working Traffic along the line was regulated by block working. Abbots Ripton and Holme had signal boxes and between them were two intermediate boxes. All controlled 'home' signals near the box and 'distant' signals about half a mile (c 800m) before the home signals. The line was thus divided into three blocks, each roughly 2 miles (c 3.1 km) long; entry to each block was controlled by the signal box at the start of the block.Inquiry ‚Äì evidence of Richard Johnson Shunting into the siding at Abbots Ripton took place in a fourth block. The 'home' signals at Abbots Ripton were interlocked with the siding points, so that whenever the points were open to the main line the Abbots Ripton home signal lever had to be at 'danger'. All boxes could communicate with adjacent boxes by their block telegraph. Signals were normally kept at 'all clear' but were set to 'danger' to protect trains as follows. When a train entered a block by passing a home signal, the signalman would set the home signal to 'danger', thus preventing a following train entering the same block. The distant would also be set to 'danger'. Trains were required to stop at a home signal at 'danger', but were allowed to pass a distant signal at 'danger' as this merely warned an approaching driver to moderate his speed to be ready to stop the train at the home signal. Both signals would be returned to 'all clear' when the next box telegraphed 'line clear'. Normally, as soon as a train was past a box's home signal, the signalman would telegraph 'line clear' to the preceding box. During foggy or snowy weather, however, when a train stopped at a station 'line clear' was not sent until the train had restarted, or been shunted into a siding.Inquiry ‚Äì evidence of Francis P Cockshutt In good weather therefore a goods train being shunted into a siding at Abbots Ripton should have been protected against another train running into it by the Abbots Ripton 'home' and 'distant' signals ; in falling snow, the home and distant signals of the previous box should have given further protection and the fast train should always have been at least one full block away. Signal boxes serving stations/sidings had, as well as the block telegraph, 'speaking telegraph' instruments. These were not telephones, but Morse code senders, used for messages (for example how late a train was running). Signals The signals used on the Great Northern to work the block system were lower quadrant semaphores.for a drawing & description see http://www.railsigns.co.uk/sect2page1/sect2page1.html A lever in the signal box was connected by a wire (under tension, and passing over intermediate pulleys) to a counterweighted arm on the signal. To set a signal to all clear, the signalman pulled the appropriate lever in his signal box; this moved the arm down (which was pivoted in a slot in the signal post), against the pull of the counterweight, \\"to a vertical position in the post\\".Inquiry report ‚Äì \\"Conclusion\\" (page 26) When the lever was moved to set the signal to danger, this did not positively drive the signal to ‚Äúdanger‚Äù but paid out slack in the wire and allowed the counterweight to take the arm to a horizontal position. An intermediate position with the arm pointing downwards at 45 degrees to the signal upright had been used to indicate ‚Äòproceed with caution‚Äô when working to the older time interval system. The position was no longer used in the block system, but some witnesses in the inquiry used it as a point of reference for how far below horizontal the signal arms were dipping Since by day the signal arms were clearly visible from the signal box from which they were worked, the system had no repeater in the signal box to confirm a signal was actually showing the aspect corresponding to the lever position. In emergency the signal could be set to ‚Äòdanger‚Äô by cutting the wire; but a heavy weight lying on the wire would keep the signal at ‚Äòall clear‚Äô by effectively pulling on it: since the signals were normally set to ‚Äòall clear‚Äô any fault which stopped them being moved would almost certainly keep them at ‚Äòall clear‚Äô as well. At night (or in poor visibility in daytime) an oil lamp displayed a white light when the signal was at 'all clear'; when the signal arm moved to the horizontal ‚Äúdanger‚Äù position it brought a red lens in front of the light, so that a red light was then displayed to oncoming trains. In poor visibility, GNR regulations called for detonators to be laid if possible on the track at the home signal when this was set to danger; at stations where platelayers were available, this should also be done at the distant signals. Brakes The express trains were made up of non-bogie non-corridor four- or six-wheel carriages. There were 13 on the Leeds express, giving a weight (including the engine and tender) of somewhat over 200 tons. At this period, other railways often had to resort to using more than one engine to maintain a high top speed; the Great Northern (favoured with one of the best engine classes of the period ‚Äì the Stirling 8-foot singles) prided itself on not doing so. As with all the other railways, though, it had considerable difficulties in stopping the trains rapidly once they were at speed. To stop a train, the driver could shut off steam, get his fireman to apply a handbrakeTo avoid confusion, modern spelling is used, but the prevailing spelling at the time was \\"break\\" on the tender and put the engine into reverse. He had no means of applying brakes to the rest of the train; indeed most of the carriages had no brakes. Two or three of the carriages were brake carriages with handbrakes, each with a guard who would apply them when (and if) he heard the driver \\"whistle for brakes\\". In trials carried out after the accident under favourable conditions this was shown to bring the train to rest within 800‚Äì1150 yards when travelling at 40‚Äì45 mph. The Railway Inspectors considered that much shorter stopping distances would be possible if passenger trains were provided with continuous brakes operable by the driver, and had urged such systems be fitted. This had been resisted by the railway companies as unnecessary, unreliable, expensive and dangerous.Dangerous because it would not increase safety margins once engine drivers realised it allowed them to go faster and/or brake later in safety ‚Äì similar to the counter-intuitive argument now applied (apparently with some validity) against making cars safer for their drivers ‚Äì and they would be in a worst case if the brakes failed Flying Scotsman On the night of the accident, the Scotch express had 10 passenger carriages. These were first- or second-class; as customary the train did not carry third-class passengers. Notable passengers included the Russian Ambassador, the deputy chairmanCharles Colville, 1st Viscount Colville of Culross and another directorRobert Tennant, Member of Parliament for Leeds of the Great Northern, and a director (John Cleghorn, formerly company secretary) and the chief engineer (Thomas Elliot Harrison, a past president of the Institution of Civil Engineers) of the North Eastern Railway. Essex Standard, West Suffolk Gazette and Eastern Counties Advertiser, 28 January 1876 At the inquest, the coroner's summing up noted that it was a heavy responsibility to stop a train, but did not explicitly suggest the prestige of the Scotch express aggravated the responsibility. =The first collision= On the afternoon of 21 January, the Peterborough-Huntingdon area was experiencing a very bad snow storm; more than one witness at the Inquiry said they had never known worse: \\"freezing blowing and snowing .. bad for seeing signals\\".Inquiry; evidence of William Wilson Crucially, the snow/sleet fell onto already cold ground and equipment, freezing on them.Further north telegraph wires accumulated ice to a diameter of 3 inches (75mm) and brought the telegraph poles downInquiry; evidence of William Henry Preece, The southbound coal train had left Peterborough about 18 minutes late, and therefore with about 12 minutes less lead on the Flying Scotsman than normal. It progressed steadily to Abbots Ripton where it stopped by the signalbox (at about 6.41) and on the instructions of the Abbots Ripton signalman began to shunt into the siding, as normal, to let the Flying Scotsman overtake. The signalman urged the driver to hurry up, as he was \\"keeping the Scotchman standing at Wood Walton (the previous signal box)\\".Inquiry ‚Äì evidence of Charles William Johnson The signalman at Holme had been concerned that, because the coal train was so late, if it went on to Abbots Ripton before shunting into a siding the Flying Scotsman would be delayed. To avoid this, he had decided to stop the train at Holme and put it into a siding there. He set his signal levers to put his signals to danger, but when the coal train arrived at Holme at 6.21 pm it did not stop. He telegraphed to Abbots Ripton that the train had run past the signals,to let Abbots Ripton know they would be shunting the coal train into the siding, not as a warning about signals misbehavingInquiry ‚Äì evidence of John Collins Osborne and told the stationmaster at Holme that the train had disobeyed the signals. As the Inquiry report noted \\"The evidence as to what then happened at the Holme station was unsatisfactorily given, and is not clear\\" The Holme station master told the enquiry that he then sent for the platelayers; whilst waiting for them he checked the up line home signal and saw it to be at 'danger'. However, when a down express went through he noticed that one of the signals did not go to 'danger' after it had passed.If true, this would be about 6.25, and hence after the Scotsman had left Peterborough (6.24) This appeared considerably at variance with other testimony. The platelayers had to be sent for because they had been allowed to go home at the end of their normal working day, despite the weather. Their foreman was uneasy about this and came out of his house to watch the up distant signal whilst two trains went past: the first of these was the Manchester express, running about 13 minutes behind the Scotsman; the second a slow stopping passenger train, a further 6 minutes behind when it left Peterborough. As he feared, the signal showed a white light throughout. He put his work clothes back on and went to the signal. The arm was weighed down with snow; once he had shaken this off by working the arm up and down it showed a red light. He then walked to the station; on his way he met a platelayer despatched to the distant signal by the stationmaster.Inquiry ‚Äì evidence of George Gammons Other witnesses also gave evidence strongly suggesting that the platelayers were not summoned until after the Scotsman had passed and were not back at work until after the Manchester express had passed (c 6.50.Inquiry ‚Äì evidence of George Thomas Gregory.). They reported that other signals (including the up home signal) were ‚Äì when first checked ‚Äì in the same state as the up distant. The signalman also claimed that the stationmaster had reported the up home signal to not be working properly. The Scotch express had left Peterborough at 6.24, about 6 minutes late. It did not slacken speed for the bad weather; it passed through Holme at about 6.37, the signals all showing clear, and arrived at Wood Walton at 6.40. The signalman there had set his signal levers to put his signals to 'danger' to protect the shunting at Abbots Ripton, but had not left his levers to set detonators at the home signal, nor did he supplement his fixed signals by displaying a hand- lamp from the signal box. He told the inquiry he was busy stopping a train of empty coal wagons on the down line, and because of the weather he did not hear the express until it ran past his cabin at full speed. At 6.44 the Scotsman reached Abbots Ripton, its driver having seen \\"nothing but white lights all the way from Peterboro\\". It was at full speed (40‚Äì45 mph) when it crashed into the coal train, which had not yet cleared the main line. Some coal wagons were smashed, but the coal train engine itself was largely unscathed. The express engine derailed and veered to the right. It ended up lying on its side, beyond the down line. Behind it, its tender and two passenger carriages were obstructing the down line. =The second collision= The railway workers involved were badly shaken ‚Äì some admitted it took them a few minutes to fully gather their wits'I did not recover myself for five or six minutes' ‚Äì evidence of Joseph Bray ; 'I recovered myself in three or four minutes' ‚Äì evidence of Edward Faulkner but the guards (whose duty it was to 'protect their train') were affected to a lesser extent. The guard of the express walked back up the up line towards Wood Walton, laying fog-signals (detonators) on the rails to warn any further trains to stop.Inquiry ‚Äì evidence of Charles Day Despite the signals showing 'all clear', the Manchester express stopped in response to the Wood Walton signalman using a hand-lamp to show a red light from his signal- box. It finally pulled up beyond the Wood Walton down distant signal; the Abbots Ripton up distant signal could be seen ahead showing the white ‚Äúall clear‚Äù.which would imply that it took over a mile to stopInquiry ‚Äì evidence of William Edis It then proceeded cautiously towards Abbots Ripton, being stopped successively by the Scotsman guard waving a red hand-lamp and then by a platelayer, eventually drawing up at the rear of the wrecked Scotsman. The fireman of the coal train similarly laid detonators on the down line just inside the Abbots Ripton down distant signal, and was then picked up by the coal train engine running light to Huntingdon to seek assistance and warn approaching down trains. This was at the instigation of a GNR ‚Äúrelief clerk‚Äù (i.e. a clerk qualified to act as a ‚Äò‚Äôlocum‚Äô‚Äô stationmaster) who had been travelling on the express.A London and North Western Railway traffic inspector also travelling on the express is noted by contemporary newspapers to have given practical assistance. Contemporary newspaper accounts e.g. that in the Sunderland Echo Monday 24 January 1876 say that Abbots Ripton was not like Holme 'a station with an agent etc. in charge' but 'merely a signalling box'. If Abbots Ripton had a station master on duty that night he did not give evidence to the inquiry, nor do other witnesses mention him The Abbots Ripton signalman was evidently dazed by the events; he set his signals in both directions to 'danger' but did not (as he should also have done) immediately send the 5-beat 'obstruction danger' bell signal to Stukeley, the next signal box south. Instead he tried to send a message reporting the crash and seeking assistance by the speaking telegraph to Huntingdon station to the south.There were two signal boxes at Huntingdon; Huntingdon North and Huntingdon South; both were on the 'speaking telegraph' ‚Äì to contact the stationmaster at Huntingdon to get assistance Abbots Ripton should have 'spoken' to Huntingdon South (which is what he did, or rather attempted); to maximise the chances of getting the train held at Huntingdon North (which he did not) He prefixed the message with the special 'SP' code indicating top priority but the signalman at Huntingdon did not answer. The Abbots Ripton signalman kept trying to raise Huntingdon, but without success; when the Huntingdon signalman did answer he first refused to accept any message not starting with a code to indicate time sent, and rebuffed subsequent sends with an 'MQ' code ‚Äì roughly translating as \\"Go away, I'm busy\\".For most signalman witnesses their length of service and time in their current post are recorded as part of their evidence ‚Äì for example the Abbots Ripton duty signalman had been at Abbots Ripton since March 1874 and had been a signalman elsewhere for the previous 3 months. The corresponding details are not given for the Huntingdon signalman; they might have been relevant to his interactions with Abbots Ripton, since UK census and birth records show that one of his children was born Abbots Ripton Q3 1873 Indeed, he was; he was accepting the Leeds express and passing it on to the next signal box. At 6.52, after trying and failing for 8 minutes to pass his message to Huntingdon South, the Abbots Ripton signalman sent the 5-beat 'obstruction danger' bell signal to Stukeley. The down Leeds express passed through Huntingdon at about 6.49 (at which time no message had been accepted from Abbots Ripton) and reached Stukeley at 6.52. The signalman at Stukeley received the 'obstruction danger' message just seconds after the express had passed. The Abbots Ripton down distant signal was showing 'all clear' and the Leeds express approached it at full speed. > I found a white light at the distant signal at Abbotts Ripton. After passing > that signal post, I was alarmed by passing over two fog-signals which > exploded; I at once shut off steam and told my mate to put on the tender > break. I was then going at 40 or 50 miles an hour. In another instant I met > an engine on the up road giving sharp whistles,The coal train engine going > to Huntingdon for help. Elsewhere Wilson says he 'whistled for brakes'. The > three guards on the express all told the enquiry they applied their brake in > response to the whistles of the coal train engine and saw a red lamp from > it, which I took to mean that there was something out of the ordinary way. I > reversed my engine, and reapplied my steam, and as soon as that was done the > collision occurredInquiry ‚Äì evidence of William Wilson Still travelling at some speed, the Leeds express ploughed through the tender and carriages blocking the line (this, rather than the first collision, is when most ‚Äì if not all ‚Äì of the deaths are thought to have occurred). The Abbots Ripton signalman had just started his 12-hour shift at 6 p.m. His colleague on the day shift returned to work on hearing of the first collision, arriving soon after the second collision. He took over the speaking telegraph, because whilst the duty signalman appeared to be doing his best to send the message he was confused at the time, and I felt I was more able to send the message than he. Messages seeking assistance were then sent to Huntingdon and Peterborough. Inquiry A Court of Inquiry was convened, and took evidence from 24 January to 17 February, issuing its report on 23 February. The inquiry rejected the conclusion of the coroner's jury that the block system was at fault and \\"had proved ineffective in a case of emergency\\", riposting \\"such a conclusion, natural enough on a superficial view to those who are not thoroughly versed in the subject, really results from a confusion of ideas\\". The problem was with signals, and any system of working railways must be ineffective if signals could not be relied upon. The Railway Inspectorate had a low opinion of the ability of inquests to see the wood for the trees. The coroner's summing up as reported in the Edinburgh Evening News of Friday 4 February 1876 as follows > ..he did not think it right to find the Holme stationmaster guilty of > manslaughter; for it was a heavy responsibility to stop a train without > urgent reason, and he placed confidence in the block system which, it > appeared, had never failed except on this fatal night. If he had committed > perjury, they ought not to find him guilty of manslaughter to punish him for > that. The conduct of the signalman at Abbots Ripton was most lamentable but > he did not think it criminal would certainly seem to have assumed that the stationmaster was justified to assume that the block system would give protection even if he knew that the signalling was failed or unreliable. =Findings= The immediate cause was the accumulation of snow on the semaphore arms and/or control wire of several sets of signals.Popular retellings (including L T C Rolt Red for Danger, a standard compendium of British rail accidents) talk of the arm being frozen in the slot. The Edinburgh Evening News of Tuesday 1 February 1876 reports the inquest to have heard the previous day from platelayers that the signals were showing a white light with the signals down and they 'seemed as if frozen in the grooves' but there is no direct statement to that effect in the Inquiry; evidence of the same witnesses includes multiple mentions of the arm having risen part-way, and of the corrective action being to dislodge snow from the partly risen arm. Furthermore the Edinburgh Evening News had reported the platelayer evidence the previous day and gone no further than the signals having been considerably out of order from snow. Other details in Rolt's account (generally the more dramatic ones) don't match the Inquiry evidence. On the night of the accident the weight of snow on some signal arms and wires meant that the arm balanced well short of the 'danger' position and that the spectacle plate failed to drop sufficiently to move a red lens in front of the white lamp displayed in the \\"all clear\\" position. The signal therefore showed a white light (\\"all clear\\") when the lever in the signal box was in fact set to danger; the snow and ice (in the words of the Inquiry Report) thus rendered the signals > not only useless for warning by red-lights the engine-driver of the Scotch- > express-train, but also a means by the exhibition of white lights of luring > him forward at full speed to the collision. The inquiry had heard evidence from experienced working-level witnesses that this (or a milder manifestation of this) was a known problem on snowy days but could easily be sorted if you knew how, e.g., by \\"jiggling the arms\\". It implicitly rejected the evidence from GNR senior managers who denied that there was any prior history of problems, but made no comment on the discrepancy.No GNR documentation of the problem or how to fix it emerged, nor did all the signalmen and platelayers say they had heard of it; that would tend to suggest that GNR senior management were genuinely unaware. Operating practice at that time was that the signals were left in the 'clear' position continuously unless protecting a static obstruction. Consequently, the signals stood at clear for considerable periods of time, and there was little opportunity to spot the problem. The inquiry report noted various suggested improvements to signal arrangements, but cautioned against over-elaborate solutions: > It is well that these and other proposals for improvement, which are > constantly invented or advocated, such as combining sight with sound at the > signals, and the use of detonators, mechanically applied, to supersede the > use of fogmen, should receive full consideration and discussion, after the > experience of so terrible an accident, caused mainly by the failure of > existing signal-arrangements. But, in the course of such deliberations, the > facts must not be lost sight of, that men are still liable to make mistakes, > machinery is still liable to fail, and further complication is by no means > certain in all cases to produce greater safety. It commented adversely on the performance of individuals: * \\"The want of judgement or precaution exhibited by the station-master at Holme\\" for not stopping the Scotsman and warning its driver of the signal problem * \\"The neglect of the Wood Walton signalman\\" in not putting detonators down or exhibiting a red handlamp to the Scotsman * \\"The delay of the signalman at the Huntingdon South\\" signal box in answering Abbots Ripton and, without blaming individuals, on *the delay in warning Stukeley of the obstruction on the down lineThe evidence would clearly have supported mentioning the Abbots Ripton duty signalman as responsible. The Inquiry report instead considered it unfortunate that he had not retained his presence of mind, but immediately went on to note that he had attempted to speak to Huntingdon within a minute of the crash; the inference is that the inquiry did not think him blameworthy. In the 1881 UK census he (or an exact namesake) was still a Railway Signalman, but at Misterton, Nottinghamshire on a less important line; the Holme stationmaster (or an exact namesake) was stationmaster at Luton Hoo railway station, a minor station on a minor branch. The Wood Walton signalman was now a railway porter (possibly because he was now married); the Huntingdon South signalman was still a signalman in a main-line box and eventually became a station master. *the failure to put platelayers at signals as soon as they were needed; to clear the signals of snow or to lay down detonators if the signals could not be made to work * ‚Äúthe running of fast through trains at full speed through such a storm .. without the adoption of extra precautions, such as the detention of slower trains, the use of hand-lamps in the signal- cabins, and the employment of platelayers at the signals‚Äù *the absence of a speaking telegraph in the intermediate signal boxes *the lack of continuous brakes on the Leeds express. =Recommendations= The Board of Trade had no regulatory powers to enforce the recommendations of the inquiry report. The most important were: * Improving signals so that they work properly in frost and snow, and that they provide an indication to the signalman if they are not operating properly * Keeping the signals normally at danger, so that if they stick there is unlikely to be a false 'clear' * The use by signalmen of hand lamps in bad weather to confirm the indications of fixed signals * The provision of telegraph apparatus in all signal boxes * The improvement of braking systems on trains * The suspension of less important trains, and the reduction in speed of other trains, in very severe weather conditions. Consequences * The GNR adopted a significantly different design of semaphore signal; the 'somersault' signal. In this, the pivot about which the arm moved was at the middle of the arm; other things being equal accumulation of snow should not significantly affect the balance of the arm * The modern practice of the default position for signals being 'danger' was adopted * Railway companies were required by law to make an annual return to the Board of Trade on what fraction of their passenger rolling stock was fitted with continuous brakes Over a longer timescale, and after further accidents * Continuous braking was fitted to passenger trains * 'All clear' was indicated by a green light (so that a broken red lens ‚Äì or one out of position- no longer gave false reassurance) Notes and references Notes References External links * Board of Trade Report file (PDF) * University of Kent Library, UK: Dion William Boucicault (1855‚Äì1876) and the Abbots Ripton Railway Disaster Category:Railway accidents in 1876 Category:1876 in England Category:Transport in Huntingdonshire Category:Accidents and incidents involving Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) Category:Rail transport in Cambridgeshire Category:Railway accidents and incidents in Huntingdonshire Category:19th century in Huntingdonshire Category:Train collisions in England ","title":"Abbots Ripton rail accident"},{"id":"6657580","title":"Giants of the Prairies"},{"id":"6657591","text":"The Trent Valley line is a railway line between Rugby and Stafford in England, forming part of the West Coast Main Line. It is named after the River Trent which it follows.

History  The Trent Valley line was opened in 1847 to give a more direct route from London to the North West of England, bypassing the existing route via Birmingham built by the Grand Junction Railway and the London and Birmingham Railway a decade earlier. The contractor for the of double-track line was the London Railway Contractors Partnership of Thomas Brassey, John Stephenson and William MacKenzie.

Stroud: Nonsuch. p. 107. and the architect was John William Livock. Construction was initially started by an independent company, the Trent Valley Railway (TVR), which was established in Manchester in April 1844. Its Act of Incorporation received Royal Assent on 21 July 1845. Construction of the line commenced in November 1845, the first sod being cut ceremonially at Tamworth by Sir Robert Peel on 13 November. In September 1845 Salford-born 26-year-old Edward Watkin was appointed Secretary, and having entered the railway world via the TVR he later went on to become one of Britain's most prominent railway barons.Backtrack Magazine ‚Äì January 2014 Whilst under construction, the TVR was bought by the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) on 15 April 1846, the L&BR; itself amalgamating with other railways to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 16 July 1846. The largest single engineering feature of the line was the Shugborough Tunnel near Stafford. The Trent Valley line was opened to a limited service of local passenger trains and through goods trains on 15 September 1847, to local goods trains on 20 October 1847 (the delay due to the goods-handling facilities at the stations not being completed) and finally to all through traffic on 1 December 1847. It is now part of what is called the West Coast Main Line. The line was originally built with two tracks, but growing traffic meant that several stretches were widened to four tracks between 1871 and 1909. =Electrification= The line was electrified on the 25 kV AC system during the 1960s, in the wake of the 1955 British Rail modernisation plan. = 2004 to 2008 works = Prior to this work being carried out, the West Coast Main Line had four tracks between London and Rugby, comprising a \\"fast line\\" and a \\"slow line\\" in each direction (the slow lines diverting via the Northampton Loop Line). Similarly, there were four tracks north of Stafford. Although parts of the Trent Valley line previously had four tracks, there was an long section of track between Tamworth and Armitage that had only ever been double track. When plans for the modernisation of the WCML were being developed in the 1990s, it was realised that these arrangements could not accommodate the faster Pendolino trains as well as slower local services. It was therefore decided to increase the number of tracks between Lichfield and Armitage to four; later it was decided to extend this from Tamworth as well, giving four tracks throughout from Nuneaton to Colwich Junction, north of Rugeley. The two outer tracks are \\"slow\\", while the \\"fast\\" lines are the two innermost tracks. Work started in 2004, and access roads were built on the eastern side of the line. Substantial earthworks were carried out and 37 bridges were replaced. A level crossing at Hademore was replaced by two road bridges in early 2007. The four-track railway between Lichfield North and Armitage was brought into use on 29 May 2008. Concurrently, Lichfield Trent Valley signal box was closed and within a month had been demolished. On 8 September the same year, the four-track railway between Tamworth and Lichfield came into use and Tamworth signal box closed. Additionally, the line between Rugby and Brinklow, formerly three tracks, was quadrupled on 27 May 2008. The line from Brinklow to Nuneaton remains three tracks.

Bridget Maclagan) was an American-British novelist and poet whose work drew on her experiences as a war nurse. She was the second of the three children of William Borden (d. 1904), who had made a fortune in Colorado silver mining in the late 1870s.Megan Mckinney. \\"The Bordens Struck it Rich in Leadville\\". http://www.classicchicagomagazine.com/the-bordens-struck-it-rich/ Family background and early life Mary Borden, known as May to her friends and family, was born into a wealthy Chicago family. (Her brother, William Whiting Borden, became well known in conservative Christian circles for his evangelistic zeal and early death while preparing to become a missionary.) Mary attended Vassar College, graduating with a BA in 1907. On a tour of the Far East, she met and married Scottish missionary George Douglas Turner, with whom she had three daughters; Joyce (born 1909), Comfort (born 1910) and Mary (born 1914). In 1913, she and Turner moved to England where Borden joined the Suffragette movement. She was arrested during a demonstration in Parliament Square for throwing a stone through the window of His Majesty's Treasury. She spent five days in police cells until bailed by her husband. World War I and nursing May Borden (center) with Sir Edward Spears (back row, left). At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, she used her own considerable money to equip and staff a field hospital for French soldiers close to the Front in which she herself served as a nurse from 1914 until the end of the war, see Voluntary Aid Detachment. There she met Brigadier General Edward Louis Spears, with whom she engaged in an affair at the Front. Her husband separated from her and took custody of their children. Following the dissolution of her marriage, she married Spears in 1918. Writing During her war-time experience she wrote poetry such as 'The Song of the Mud' (1917).https://archive.org/stream/2englishreview25londuoft/2englishreview25londuoft_djvu.txt  Full text of \\"English Review\\" August 1917, including 'The Song of the Mud' Notably, her work includes a striking set of sketches and short stories, The Forbidden Zone (1929), which was published in the same year as A Farewell to Arms, Good-Bye to All That and All Quiet on the Western Front. Even in this context, contemporary readers were disturbed at the graphic - sometimes hallucinatory - quality of work coming from a woman who had first-hand experience of life on the front line. The Forbidden Zone contained five long poems that describe what she saw and did working in the military hospital, and are full of passionate energy and compassion. Their style is reminiscent of Walt Whitman who also tended to the wounded on the battlefield, in his case during the American Civil War. She wrote a number of other poems about the war and also about her affair with Spears which were not published in book form until 2015, one hundred years after they were written. Mary Borden, Poems of Love and War, edited by Paul O'Prey, was published in London by Dare-Gale Press, distributed by the University of Chicago Press in the US. Her war poems were slow to be recognised but now feature in several modern First World War poetry anthologies Her 1937 novel Action for Slander was adapted into a film the same year. World War II Living in England between the wars, she was drawn back to France in the expectation of mounting some sort of aid facility similar to that she had run in the first war. With funds donated by Sir Robert Hadfield via his wife, Lady Hadfield, she set up the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, which was based in Lorraine until forced by the German Blitzkrieg to retreat across France before its evacuation from Arcachon in June 1940. In Britain, the unit re-grouped and received further funding from the British War Relief Society in New York. In May 1941, the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit was attached to the Free French in the Middle East, before accompanying their forces across North Africa, Italy and France. Journey Down a Blind Alley, published on her return to Paris in 1946, records the history of the unit and her disillusion with the French failure to put up an effective resistance to the German invasion and occupation. A first person account of Lady Spears and the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit can be found in the memoirs of Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, To War with Whitaker.To War with Whitaker, The Wartime Diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly 1939-45 Later life In her later life, she often returned to the United States and assisted her nephew-in-law Adlai Stevenson II in his run for the presidency, even writing some of his speeches.

It was published monthly from 2001 to 2012 and was supplied to both Christian and general market retailers.  History  The magazine began in 1996 as the Christian Bookstore Journal. It was published on a monthly basis. This was soon renamed to the European Christian Bookstore Journal (ECBJ) and was located at the offices of the unofficial European branch of the Christian Booksellers Association. At this time the magazine was run by John Macdonald who also owned the Christian World Centre bookstore in Manchester, England. In 1999, with the magazine facing bankruptcy, John MacDonald and SilverFish Publishing entered into a joint venture to replace ECBJ with a new magazine called Christian Bookseller. However, after the publication of the first issue, the parties entered into a dispute, with the result that SilverFish published a new magazine also entitled Christian Bookseller. Edited by Ian Matthews (also edited ECBJ in 1998), the magazine changed its name in March 2001 to Christian Retailer. SilverFish went out of business in July 2001 and the magazine ceased at this point. However, in August 2001, Ian Matthews, along with another former employee of SilverFish, Phil Whittall, formed a new company called Sojourn Publications and released a new incarnation of the magazine titled Christian Marketplace. The title was eventually sold to Premier Media Group, who also run Premier Radio in 2002 where it was edited by Phil Whittall until August 2006. The editor was Clem Jackson. The last issue of Christian Marketplace was published in September 2012.

It occupies the building of the largest and oldest former Ottoman mosque in the city, originally known as Koca Mahmut Pa≈üa Camii. The construction started in 1451 under grand vizier Veli Mahmud Pasha but due to his death in 1474 the mosque has been completed in 1494. The museum was established as a separate entity in 1893 as the National Museum directed by Czech V√°clav Dobrusk√Ω with its headquarters in the former mosque that previously housed the National Library between 1880 and 1893. The museum was officially opened and inaugurated in 1905, as by then all archaeological exhibits previously kept all over the city were moved there, in the presence of Knyaz Ferdinand of Bulgaria and Minister of Enlightenment Ivan Shishmanov. Several additional halls and administrative buildings of the museum were constructed in the following years, which continues to use the historic stone building of the old mosque despite the often unfavourable conditions, notably the humidity in the summer. The museum has five exhibition halls: Central Hall, Prehistory, Middle Ages, Treasure, and a special temporary exhibition. It is managed by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.  History  The museum around 1920 The idea for the creation of an archaeological institute with a museum was conceived among exiled Bulgarian intellectuals in the 1840s, and was among the top priorities for the Bulgarian Literary Society immediately after its establishment in 1869. During the interim Russian administration immediately after the Liberation of Bulgaria, the first steps towards the establishment of a national archaeological museum were taken. In 1892, the institution was de jure established through a decree by the Knyaz, and the assembly of its collections began the next year. Initially it was also known as a \\"Museum- temple of the Fatherland\\". Until 1906, the museum included a collection of ethnographic items. By this year however, the collection was becoming so vast that it had to be separated and displayed in a separate institution, which became the Ethnographic Museum of Sofia. Since its foundation, the Museum works actively in cooperation with the Bulgarian Archaeological Society. In 1920 an Archaeological Institute headed by Bogdan Filov was established as an independent institution. It was merged with the museum in 1948 and is under the auspices of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences ever since. The museum today After World War II the joint institution launched a series of archaeological expeditions inside Bulgaria. They conducted studies on a number of sites from the Chalcolithic to the early Middle Ages, which resulted in a number of additional artifacts being added to the museum collection. Today the museum stores a large number of items, although some of them are threatened by damage due to the design of the building, which is characterised by high moisture levels during the summer season.  Collections  * Prehistory Hall - located at the lower floor of the northern wing. It displays a collection of items dating from between 1,600,000 BC and 1,600 BC. The collection is chronologically displayed and includes various findings from caves around Bulgaria, tools of the earliest humans who inhabited its modern territory, drawings, simple pottery, ritual items and many others. It subdivides into an Early, Middle and Late Paleolithic collection, Neolithic collection, Chalcolithic collection, and Bronze Age. * Treasury - located in the eastern wing and displays grave inventory and other treasures from the late Bronze Age to late Antiquity. Two of the most well-known Bulgarian treasures are located here: the Valchitran and Lukovit Treasures. * Main Hall - located at the first floor of the main building. Hosts a collection of diverse items ranging from ancient Thrace, Greece and Rome to the late Middle Ages. * Medieval Section - located at the second floor of the main building. Includes a gallery of medieval books, woodwork, drawings, metal objects and other items characteristic of the era. * Temporary Exhibitions - the hall is located at the second floor of the main building.

The company was incorporated in 1946 at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, India on the initiative the then Travancore King, Sree Chithira Thirunal.By TRAVANCORE TITANIUM PRODUCTS LTD. : \\"The visionary thinking of Maharaja of Travancore led to the incorporation of Travancore Titanium Products Limited on 18th December 1946 in collaboration with British Titan Products, UK (Huntsman). His highness late Sri. Chithira Thirunal Balaramavarma Maharaja visualized the industrialization of his kingdom by finding out the rich mineral deposits in the beach sand near Quilon.\\" The main product is pigment grade titanium dioxide which is extracted from ilmenite, which is abundantly available as placer deposits on beaches near Kollam, 65 km north of Thiruvananthapuram. Ilmenite, a mixture of titanium dioxide and iron in the form of ferric/ferrous oxide, is treated with Sulphuric Acid to get Titanium dioxide and ferrous sulphate. The company was promoted by His Highness Chithira Tirunal Balaramavarma Maharaja, the then ruler of the State of Travancore (now Kerala State in India) with the technical collaboration of British Titan Products. Though the company was registered in 1946, actual production was started only in 1952 with a small capacity of 5 t.p.a. Later subsequent expansions were made in 1962 and 1973 and now TTP can produce about 20000 tonnes of titanium dioxide per annum.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/central-pollution-control- board-orders-titanium-shutdown/article18575359.ece In 1960 Government of Kerala took over the management of the Company. Now the administrative control is vested with the Department of Industries, Government of Kerala. The company also possesses a modern sulphuric acid plant which was commissioned in 1996, for utilizing the tail gas recycling DCDA (Double Catalysis Double Absorption) technology. An alkali scrubbing system is incorporated in the plant, and this in turn helps to keep sulphur dioxide emissions from the factory well within permissible limits. For about 50 years, TTP was one of the profit making Public Sector Undertaking of Government of Kerala. Every year company declares a dividend of around 20 per cent. TTP is contributing crores of rupees to the State exchequer by way of Sales Tax, other duties and levies. Welfare amenities, salary and perquisites, working environment etc. are comparatively satisfactory. TTP has a good library with around 25000 books in stock. TTP has a strength of around 1300 employees now. Titanium also offers summer internships for engineering students to study and improve the functioning of the organisation. Football Club During the 70s, TItanium Football team was one of the most acclaimed Football Clubs in Kerala, winning so many covetable trophies. Players like B. Sasikumaran Pillai, Sankarankutty, Abdul Hameed, Najumuddin, Thomas Sebastian, Abdul Rasheed Kariyambath, V.

It is located on Guanabara Bay, between Rio de Janeiro to the south and the Serra dos √ìrg√£os range of hills to the north. Its municipalities are part of the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region. The Baixada Fluminense region's population is about three million, making it the second most populous region in the state, following only the city of Rio de Janeiro. This region should not be confused with the Baixadas Litor√¢neas, located farther to the east in the same state.

The municipalities of Mag√© and Guapimirim (to the east), Japeri, Paracambi and Serop√©dica. History ;18th century Until the 19th century, the region was known as the Baixada da Guanabara. It experienced some development during the 18th century, when it was an important corridor for transporting gold mined in the neighboring state of Minas Gerais. ;19th century In the 19th century was one of the first regions to develop coffee plantations. However, during the reign of Emperor Pedro II the region suffered serious economic decline due to the creation of railroads, which led to a sharp decline in the traffic on the region's rivers and roads. ;20th century In the early 20th century the area experienced a great influx of persons arriving from other parts of the country, mainly from Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais and Northeastern Brazil, in search of a better quality of life near Rio de Janeiro, which at the time was the capital of Brazil. In the second half of the 20th century, the region acquired a reputation for poverty, crime and inadequate social services, which continues to this day. Favelas are located here. Large marsh drainage projects were undertaken in order to improve sanitary conditions.

It was established in 1945 when the Jesuits took over the administration of the diocesan secondary school, Cagayan Valley Atheneum. The Jesuits renamed the school Ateneo de Tuguegarao after taking control. The Jesuits were naming all the schools that they were opening at that time Ateneo. Ateneo de Tuguegarao was the fifth school in the Philippines that the Jesuits named Ateneo. Ateneo de Tuguegarao had a high school and college departments. In 1962, the school was closed when the Jesuits left Tuguegarao. Brief history Filipinos who identified the title \\"Ateneo\\" with Jesuit schools and who knew the Latin parent, if not the meaning, of the word, were surprised and even disturbed that a new school was opening in Northern Luzon under the title of Cagayan Valley Atheneum -- not conducted by the Jesuits. The Cagayan Valley Atheneum, a secondary school, was founded by Constancio Jurgens, bishop of Tuguegarao in 1938. From its foundation until the war, it was housed in ample buildings adjoining the Cathedral of Tuguegarao. The buildings were destroyed during the fighting between the Philippine Commonwealth and Japanese forces in 1945. The school reopened in temporary structures of nipa and sawali erected in the patio of the pre-war compound. Shortly after its reopening during the school year 1945-1946, the Atheneum was committed by Bishop Jurgens to the direction of the Society of Jesus, and prior to school year 1949-1950, complete jurisdiction was transferred to the Society, due to the withdrawal of the C.I.C.M. missionaries after the war. In October 1950, the school was moved to a new site in the southwest section of Tuguegarao. Two buildings, Loyola and Xavier Halls, were completed in time for occupancy before the second semester of school year 1950-51. The classrooms, laboratories, libraries and students' chapel were situated in the Loyola Hall. Xavier Hall housed the Jesuits' quarters, students dormitory and study hall. A third building, Bellarmine Hall, was completed shortly after the beginning of the second semester and used for boarders' dining room. In 1953, an Administration building was completed. The Ateneo de Tuguegarao had no grade school, and was an all-male school. A college department was added to the High School in June 1947. Until 1953 it had only a two-year Pre-Law course and a two-year Commerce course. In 1953, government recognition of a four-year Commerce course was obtained. It was a small school, and the collegiate offerings were limited to Pre-Law and Commerce courses. During the early years, the college student body was almost equally divided into Pre-Law and Commerce students. The courses have been chosen with regard for local circumstances. The Commerce course would prepare the students for local business enterprises, and many of the Pre-Law students went to law schools in Manila. These Pre-Law students were encouraged by the Ateneo to attend a law school under Catholic auspices as they have received a solid foundation on their catholic faith in college. Approximately fifty percent of the High School graduates go on to college; of these approximately two thirds go to Manila, the rest continue at the Ateneo de Tuguegarao. The Rev. Leo McGovern, S.J. was the first Jesuit Director of the Ateneo de Tuguegarao. He was succeeded in January 1947 by the Rev. Walter F. Hyland, S.J. who remained as Director until July 1948 when the Rev. Ralph M. O'Neill, S.J. was appointed Vice Rector. Father O'Neill became Rector in September 1951, until succeeded in that office in 1952 by the Rev. Rosalino Pascua, S.J. Father Pascua is to be reckoned among the \\"noteworthy features\\" of the Ateneo de Tuguegarao, for he had been active in the school since the Jesuits first came in 1946. The school was closed when the Jesuits left Tuguegarao in 1962. School name The name Ateneo is the Spanish form of the Latin name Athen√¶um, which the Dictionary of Classical Antiquities defines as the name of \\"the first educational institution in Rome\\" where \\"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, was where \\"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\\" Athen√¶um is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning. The Ateneo de Tuguegarao is not the only Jesuit school that the Jesuits named Ateneo. The Society of Jesus has established 16 schools all over the Philippines since 1590 where nine of them were given the name Ateneo. Ateneo de Tuguegarao was the fifth school named Ateneo. Over the years, the name \\"Ateneo\\" has become recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the Philippines and synonymous with academic excellence. School seal The Ateneo de Tuguegarao seal is similar to the school seal of four other Ateneos. It is circular in shape. The school motto in Latin is printed on top of the circle and the name of the school at the bottom of the circle. At the center are the shield of the family of St Ignatius of Loyola and the seal of the Society of Jesus. What differentiates it from the seals of the other four Ateneos are the pictures of the corn and rice stalks which are the prime crops of Cagayan Valley and the name Ateneo de Tuguegarao printed on it. School motto The school motto is the Latin phrase CREDO DOMINE, which means I Believe in the Lord. This is taken from the Bible - Mark 9:24 The boy's father immediately exclaimed, \\"I do believe! Help my lack of trust!\\". Epilogue Many years later, the school was administered again by the CICM and became University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao.

Career Norwich initially bid for Crewe striker Mark Rivers on Transfer Deadline Day in March 2001. Another bid was made in May 2001 as Nigel Worthington sought a pacy striker to partner Iwan Roberts, and share the goal scoring responsibilities. Both bids were rejected but in June 2001, Crewe and Norwich came to agreement over a deal worth approximately ¬£1,000,000. Whilst Rivers was on holiday and hadn't signed a contract or passed a medical, the deal was concluded by both clubs as a forgone concussion. Mark finally signed for Norwich at the end of June 2001. Twenty- five-year-old Rivers had scored 58 goals in 239 games for Crewe, including 10 goals in 38 appearances in 2000/01. Rivers made 37 appearances during Norwich's almost-successful 2001/02 campaign but only completed 90minutes on one occasion giving the Carrow Road faithful concern over his long term fitness. He started the 2002/03 season well but suffered an injury against Watford that saw him miss over a month's action. He finished the campaign with 32 appearances and 4 goals to his credit. Another good start to 2003/04 saw him quickly established as the Canaries' leading scorer until injury again forced him out of the side. When fit, he could not displace either loan signing Kevin Harper or youngster Ian Henderson. Rumours from Carrow Road also suggested a bust-up between Rivers and manager Nigel Worthington. Unable to get a first team place, Rivers made it clear that he needed first team football. Crewe offered to take him on loan in January 2004 but Norwich refused and he returned to the Norwich team in the 1‚Äì0 defeat to Bradford on 10 January 2004, albeit as a substitute. In June 2004, Rivers was the subject of speculation linking him with a move to Burnley. At the beginning of July 2004, Norwich and Rivers agreed to cancel his contract as he wanted first team football. He joined neighbours Ipswich Town almost immediately, playing in their pre-season friendly against Peterborough on 10 July 2004. When Ipswich decided against taking him on, Rivers returned to Crewe on trial. He signed a two-year deal with his former club on 20 July at half-time during Crewe's friendly with Everton. On 23 January 2006, Rivers signed for Carlisle United until the end of the 2005/6 season. He parted company with them on mutual terms on 28 April 2006.

Helmet orchids are small, perennial, deciduous herbs and are nearly always terrestrial. They have a single leaf at their base and a single flower on a short stalk, the flower dominated by its large dorsal sepal and labellum. Species of Corybas are found in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Southeast Asia, the Himalayas, southern China, many Pacific islands and a few sub-Antarctic islands.  Description  Orchids in the genus Corybas are perennial, deciduous, sympodial, usually terrestrial herbs, lacking roots. (A few sometimes grow as epiphytes on the fibrous bark of tree ferns or on the mossy branches of trees.) They have an underground tuber which is more or less spherical and fleshy. New tubers form at the end of root-like stolons. There is a single, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped or almost round leaf, usually at ground level and a short erect stem with a single flower at the top. The flower has a short stalk with a small, leaf-like bract at its base. The flower is resupinate, dull-coloured and resembles the fruiting body of a fungus. The dorsal sepal is much larger than the lateral sepals and petals and curves forward, often forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals and petals are small, linear to almost thread-like. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum and in this genus is often the most obvious part of the flower. The labellum is large, deeply concave or tube-shaped with its base attached to the base of the column and sometimes completely surrounding the column. Sometimes there is a pair of small, ear-like appendages on either side, near the base. The column is small, enclosed by the base of the labellum and has small wings. In temperate regions, flowering occurs between autumn and spring and in tropical regions in most months. The fruit that follows flowering is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds. As the fruit matures, the flower withers and the flower stem elongates to a length of up to , aiding in seed dispersal.Labelled image (Corybas pictus) Taxonomy and naming Corybas aconitiflorus was first formally described by Richard Salisbury, allegedly from a colour plate prepared by Ferdinand Bauer and thus became the type species for the genus. The description was published in The Paradisus Londinensis. Salisbury stated that the name of the genus was derived from similarity of the flowers to the covered head of the Greek (), a male dancer, shown in illustrations wearing a crested helmet, who worshipped the goddess Cybele. Korybas was a priest of Cybele, \\"whose religious rites were accompanied by frenzied music and dancing\\". A 2002 revision of Corybas split it into numerous genera, but this is not widely accepted. Ecology Pollination appears to be achieved by small insects, possibly mistaking the unusual flowers for fungi.Lehnebach C.A., Zeller, A.J., Frericks, J, Ritchie P. (2016) Five new species of Corybas (Diurideae, Orchidaceae) endemic to New Zealand and phylogeny of the Nematoceras clade. Phytotaxa 270: 1-24. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.11646/phytotaxa.270.1.1 Helmet orchids have not often been studied, partly because of their short-lived, inconspicuous flowers but also because the flowers are difficult to preserve as herbarium specimens. Many form clonal colonies but it is not known whether this is a characteristic of all species. Distribution and habitat Helmet orchids grow in India, South China, Taiwan, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, the Philippines, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Ponape, Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Australia (including Macquarie Island), New Zealand (including Chatham, Stewart, Auckland and Campbell Islands), Tahiti, Samoa and the Society Islands. Australian species usually grow in moist, shady places, often with dense moss or on rotting logs, sometimes with orchids from other genera. =Gallery= Image:Corybas pictus (as Corysanthes limbata) - Curtis' 89 (Ser. 3 no. 19) pl. 5357 (1863).jpgCorybas pictus 1863 illustration from Curtis's Botanical Magazine Image:Corybas diemenicus Orchi 010-1.jpgCorybas diemenicus from N.S.W., Vic. and Tas.

The Garos did have a reputation for keeping their word. In religious matters, the Garos were animists, focusing on placating the spirits to appease their wrath and satisfy their demands. They believed in a supreme God, but felt that He was detached from men and was not to be much concerned with, either for good or ill. Ramke himself was a devotional person and, while he was an animist, he was very earnest in catching little animals or birds and sacrificing them to the spirits. In 1847, the British, who were extending their rule in India, invited boys from the Garo tribe to come down to Goalpara in the valley and receive an education. Ramke's uncle, Omed, went down to school at this time, but Ramke was detained at home, since he had recently broken his arm. Later he joined them and was found to be a good scholar. In Goalpara he learned about Hinduism and its teaching about reincarnation. This idea dismayed him. As an animist, he had placated the spirits, but believed that, whether in this life or the next, people were people, not animals or plants. As he considered ultimate things, he thought not only of wrath and punishment, but of love and about the great God above everything else. He prayed to God for blessing and for peace of mind. After praying thus for three days in a row, he received a visitation from Heaven, declaring that his prayer was heard. When he tried to tell others about his vision, he received ridicule from everyone except the Hindu ‚Äúholy men,‚Äù or sadhus. They instructed him further in Hindu theology, including Vishnu, a savior figure. Ramke was very attracted to Vishnu, especially in his incarnation as Ram. So, Ramke began to worship Ram. Later, Ramke came across a Christian tract that systematically discredited Hinduism. He was convinced by the tract, but thrown into despair because his worship of Ram was taken from him. In The Garo Jungle Book, it is said, ‚ÄúThe tracts of those days were pointed, uncompromising attacks on the falseness of the prevailing faiths.‚Äù Omed, who lived at Gauhati, came across the same tract, but had a more positive reaction. Omed had a Christian associate and invited Ramke to come to Gauhati and together they studied Christianity. Then, as a policeman, Ramke was sent to another assignment, where he fell into discouragement spiritually. But then he read a book about Christian heroism, which helped him. Among the Garos, the women chose their husbands. A girl named Suban proposed to Ramke and he accepted. After the wedding, he told her he was thinking about becoming a Christian, which she considered a frightening prospect. Nevertheless, after a while Ramke returned to Omed; they studied Christianity more and were baptized, contrary to the wishes of their wives. They begged for a missionary to be sent to their people, but when none was available, they eventually offered themselves. They were accepted and a salary was given to them. Ramke preached a little, but primarily focused on starting a school in Damra. After preaching for a while, Omed was driven away. He built a hut at the foot of the Rajasimla Pass, where travelers could rest on their way to and from the market. Eventually the witness of these two men and other Christians, including Western missionaries, won over many other Garos to Christianity. Ramke felt there was a need for another Christian village where new converts could learn more about the faith, without opposition from their neighbors. Thus developed the village of Nisangram. He was ordained as pastor and served as headmaster of the Normal School, both at Goalpara and at Tura. He assisted in the translation of the Scriptures into Garo and a Bengali-Garo dictionary. ‚ÄúAs preacher and evangelist to his own people he traveled widely and baptized many. ‚ÄòOn his list were over two thousand two hundred names of those who had found of their Saviour,‚Äô in part, at least, through these personal efforts.‚Äù (from ‚ÄúThe Garo Jungle Book‚Äù, William Carey) He passed to his rest on January 25, 1891.

The medication is available only in combination with an estrogen.https://www.drugs.com/international/etynodiol.html It is taken by mouth. Etynodiol diacetate is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body, with etynodiol occurring as an intermediate. Etynodiol, a related compound, was discovered in 1954, and etynodiol diacetate was introduced for medical use in 1965. The medication remains available today only in the United States, Canada, and a few other countries. Medical uses Etynodiol diacetate is used in combination with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol or mestranol in combined oral contraceptives for women. Side effects Pharmacology Norethisterone (3-ketoetynodiol), the active metabolite of etynodiol diacetate. Etynodiol diacetate is virtually inactive in terms of affinity for the progesterone and androgen receptors and acts as a rapidly converted prodrug of norethisterone, with etynodiol occurring as an intermediate. Upon oral administration and during first-pass metabolism in the liver, etynodiol diacetate is rapidly converted by esterases into etynodiol, which is followed by oxygenation of the C3 hydroxyl group to produce norethisterone. In addition to its progestogenic activity, etynodiol diacetate has weak androgenic activity, and, unlike most progestins but similarly to norethisterone and noretynodrel, also has some estrogenic activity. The pharmacokinetics of etynodiol diacetate have been reviewed. Chemistry Etynodiol diacetate, also known as 3Œ≤-hydroxy-17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diaceate, 3Œ≤-hydroxynorethisterone 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diacetate, or 17Œ±-ethynylestr-4-ene-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diacetate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of 19-nortestosterone and 17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone, or of norethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone), in which the C3 ketone group has been dehydrogenated into a C3Œ≤ hydroxyl group and acetate esters have been attached at the C3Œ≤ and C17Œ≤ positions. Etynodiol diacetate is the 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diacetate ester of etynodiol (17Œ±-ethynylestr-4-ene-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol). =Synthesis= Searle). Prepn of the 3-acetate, 17-acetate, and diacetate: P. D. Klimstra, (1965 to Searle); see also: Chemical syntheses of etynodiol diacetate have been published. Reduction of norethisterone (1) affords the 3,17-diol. The 3Œ≤-hydroxy compound is the desired product; since reactions at C3 do not show nearly the stereoselectivity as those at C17 by virtue of the relative lack of stereo-directing proximate substituents, the formation of the desired isomer is engendered by use of a bulky reducing agent, lithium tri-tert- butoxyaluminum hydride. Acetylation of the 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol affords etynodiol diacetate (3). History Etynodiol was first synthesized in 1954, via reduction of norethisterone, and etynodiol diacetate was introduced for medical use in 1965. Society and culture =Generic names= Etynodiol diacetate is the generic name of the drug (the of its free alcohol form is etynodiol), while ethynodiol diacetate is its , , and . It is also known by its former developmental code names CB-8080 and SC-11800. =Brand names= Etynodiol diacetate is or has been marketed under brand names including Conova, Continuin, Demulen, Femulen, Kelnor, Luteonorm, Luto-Metrodiol, Metrodiol, Ovulen, Soluna, Zovia, and others. =Availability= Etynodiol diacetate remains marketed in only a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Oman.

It is the capital of the Cordillera Province in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. Located at the south of the Great Santiago conurbation (of which it is part), it houses 568,106 inhabitants (city proper, 2017 census), making it the largest commune in Chile. History After 1883, the province of Santiago was divided into three departments: Santiago, La Victoria and Melipilla. In 1891 the \\"Autonomic Commune Law\\" was enacted, after which the president signed as the \\"Decree of the Creation of Municipalities.\\" From this decree the department of La Victoria was divided into the municipalities of Pe√±aflor, Talagante, Calera de Tango, San Jos√© de Maipo y Lo Ca√±as. According to regional law, the authorities of this new sector would be able to increase in proportion to the number of inhabitants in the area, as well as adding three additional mayors the bureaucratic structure. This law was passed with the aim of giving more individual power to the remote areas of the fast-growing city, instead of everything being governed as a whole under La Victoria. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Puente Alto spans an area of and has 492,915 inhabitants (240,862 men and 252,053 women). Of these, 492,603 (99.9%) lived in urban areas and 312 (0.1%) not.

WAEB broadcasts at 790 kHz AM. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. History WAEB began operations in 1949. The station was sold to Rust Broadcasting in 1957, adopting a Top 40 format and the slogan Music Radio 79 WAEB. In 1983, the station began to evolve into more of a Hot Adult Contemporary format, and by 1985, more of a straight Adult Contemporary format beginning to emphasise Oldies. In 1986 WAEB added evening syndicated Talk shows. Overnight talk was added by 1989 and the station was playing oldies during the day at that point. WAEB and WAEB-FM were sold to CRB Broadcasting in the late 1980s. In 1993 WAEB evolved into a Talk Format, and in 1995 the station along with WAEB were sold to Capstar along with WZZO and WKAP. The stations all went to AM/FM Broadcasting as a result of the Chancellor/Capstar merger in 1999. When AM/FM merged with Clear Channel (which owned WODE and WEEX), the company would be forced to sell an AM and FM station to be under legal ownership limits. Clear Channel would give Nassau cash plus WODE and WEEX in exchange for New Jersey stations WSUS, WNNJ, WNNJ-FM, WHCY, WDLC LMA, and WTSX LMA. As a result, WAEB, WAEB FM, WZZO and WKAP were now Clear Channel Stations. In January 2007, after WKAP dropped the Oldies format in favor of religious programming (also changing its call letters to WYHM), WAEB launched an Internet radio station playing Oldies music on its Web site. Strong demand still exists for an AM or FM station dedicated to the Oldies format lost when WKAP changed its format. On September 4, 2009, the northernmost tower mast of the station's five-tower antenna array located in Whitehall Township was toppled when a vandal or vandals cut the tower's guy wires.WAEB radio tower toppled in Whitehall, FBI investigates http://www.mcall.com/news/all-a8_5tower.7011612sep05,0,7619214.story Programming WAEB currently runs a standard slate of news talkers typical of Clear Channel Communications owned stations.

Barnesmore Gap () is a mountain pass or gap (elevation 117 m) situated in the Bluestack Mountains, County Donegal, Ireland. The main Donegal to Ballybofey road, the N15, and former County Donegal Railway run through Barnesmore gap, acting as the main route between south and north Donegal. It is an area of complex geology, but its main feature is granite formed in the Devonian period, 400million ears ago. The gap held glaciers in the Last Glacial Period flowing to the Atlantic through what is now Donegal Bay, up to about 13000 years ago. The narrow gauge railway line was originally the West Donegal Railway which subsequently became part of the network managed by the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. The company pioneered the use of diesel rail-cars which ran through the gap up to the late 1950s, connecting Stranorlar in the east to Donegal Town, and through to Killybegs in the west.

The books in the series include Cut to the Quick (1994), A Broken Vessel (1995), Whom the Gods Love (1996), and The Devil in Music (1998). The Lullaby Cheat (1997), a short story featuring Kestrel, is included in the mystery anthology Crime Through Time, edited by Miriam Grace Monfredo and Sharan Newman. The novels and short story in the series are set in the English Regency era in Great Britain. Kestrel is a trend-setting dandy, similar in influence to Beau Brummel, who takes up detection as a response to boredom with the emptiness of society. Over the course of the series, it is revealed that Kestrel is the son of a talented actress, who died giving birth to him, and the younger son of a Yorkshire squire who was disowned by his well-to-do family after his marriage. He was later mentored by a French nobleman who helped him learn the ways of society and the appropriate way to dress. Kestrel's partner in detection is his valet Thomas Stokes, known as Dipper. Dipper got his nickname from his first career as a pickpocket. Kestrel hired Dipper after he caught Dipper stealing his watch. Other characters in the series include Dr. Duncan MacGregor, a gruff Scottish-born physician who assists Kestrel in some of his cases; Dipper's sister Sally Stokes, a saucy street prostitute who helps Kestrel and Dipper solve the mysterious death of a \\"fallen woman\\" in A Broken Vessel and becomes Kestrel's lover; and Philippa Fontclair, a charming young girl whom Kestrel meets in Cut to the Quick and corresponds with in later novels. The novels are heavily influenced by other fictional British detectives, such as Lord Peter Wimsey and Sherlock Holmes. Kate Ross died of cancer before she was able to complete more books in the series. However, fans speculated that she might have ultimately intended for Kestrel to marry a grown-up Philippa Fontclair. In Cut to the Quick, the plain but clever and witty 11-year-old Philippa asks Kestrel if he might marry her one-day because \\"I will have money and I am a Fontclair.\\" Kestrel advises the young girl that she should look for a husband who is more interested in her for herself than for her pocketbook and pedigree. He says it is best to be \\"the one radiant Circe in a season of dreary Helens\\" and to enchant others with her wit than to be pretty. Philippa then vows to marry Kestrel when she grows up.

Production activity has been generally concentrated in two regions, South Florida and Central Florida (Orlando and Tampa). The South Florida region is famous for large projects like Jerry Bruckheimer's Bad Boys film series and Neal Moritz's 2 Fast 2 Furious. The Central Florida area has been featured in The Punisher, starring John Travolta, and Adam Sandler's The Waterboy. The state of Florida has a long film history thanks to its year- round sunshine and moderate climate. Film classics were filmed throughout the state, such as Moon Over Miami (1941) and Esther Williams' Easy to Love (1953). Orlando In the early 1990s Orlando experienced a great boom in film production. The construction of the Disney-MGM Studios and Universal Studios production facilities attracted many filmmakers to the area. Films like Ron Howard's Parenthood and syndicated television shows like The Adventures of Superboy led the pack. Soon, the Steven Spielberg series seaQuest DSV and Tom Hank's From the Earth to the Moon called Florida home. During this period Orlando acquired the nickname \\"Hollywood East\\" because of its surging film industry. Just as film production appeared to be on the decline in Florida, the phenomenal success of 1998's The Blair Witch Project led to another boom. While this film was filmed in Maryland, its director and entire crew were University of Central Florida film school graduates. This cult independent film has led to a new wave of film production for the area. Celebrity residents Florida is also the home of many famous actors.

The medication is available in both low-dose and high-dose formulations and both alone and in combination with an estrogen. It is used by mouth or, as norethisterone enanthate, by injection into muscle. Side effects of norethisterone include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/018405s023lbl.pdf Norethisterone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity, mostly at high dosages, and no other important hormonal activity. Norethisterone was discovered in 1951 and was one of the first progestins to be developed. It was first introduced for medical use on its own in 1957 and was introduced in combination with an estrogen for use as a birth control pill in 1963. It is sometimes referred to as a \\"first-generation\\" progestin. Along with desogestrel, it is one of the only progestins that is widely available as a progestogen-only \\"mini pill\\" for birth control. Norethisterone is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 141st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Medical uses Norethisterone is used as a hormonal contraceptive in combination with an estrogen ‚Äì usually ethinylestradiol (EE) ‚Äì in combined oral contraceptive pills and alone in progestogen-only pills. Another medical use of norethisterone is to alleviate endometriosis related pain. In fact, 50% of patients who received medical or surgical treatment for endometriosis-related pelvic pain have benefited from progestin therapy. This could be due to the fact that norethisterone induces endometrial proliferation during secretory phase, which has been shown to alleviate endometrial pain complaints. Another way in which norethisterone may be acting to reduce endometrial pain is via inhibition of ovulation. Endometriosis pain and discomfort is worse during ovulation. =Available forms= Contraindications High-dose (10 mg/day) norethisterone has been associated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and because of this adverse effect, norethisterone should not be given to patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, as it has been associated with substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation. Side effects At contraceptive and hormone replacement dosages (0.35 to 1 mg/day), norethisterone has essentially progestogenic side effects only. In most clinical studies of norethisterone for contraception or menopausal hormone therapy, the drug has been combined with an estrogen, and for this reason, it is difficult to determine which of the side effects were caused by norethisterone and which of them were caused by estrogen in such research. However, NETE, an intramuscularly administered prodrug of norethisterone which is used as a long-acting contraceptive, is used without an estrogen, and hence can be employed as a surrogate for norethisterone in terms of understanding its effects and tolerability. In clinical studies, the most common side effect with NETE has been menstrual disturbances, including prolonged bleeding or spotting and amenorrhea. Other side effects have included periodic abdominal bloating and breast tenderness, both of which are thought to be due to water retention and can be relieved with diuretics. There has been no association with weight gain, and blood pressure, blood clotting, and glucose tolerance have all remained normal. However, a decrease in cholesterol has been observed. At high doses (5 to 60 mg/day), for instance those used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, norethisterone can cause hypogonadism due to its antigonadotropic effects and can have estrogenic and weak androgenic side effects. High doses of NETA (10 mg/day) have been associated with abnormal liver function tests, including significant elevations in liver enzymes. These liver enzymes included lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase. Although they were described as having no clinical relevance, the elevated liver enzymes associated with NETA may have precluded its further development for male hormonal contraception. =Androgenic= Due to its weak androgenic activity, norethisterone can produce androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice changes of slight severity in some women at high dosages (e.g., 10 to 40 mg/day). This is notably not the case with combined oral contraceptives that contain norethisterone and EE, however. Such formulations contain low dosages of norethisterone (0.35 to 1 mg/day) in combination with estrogen and are actually associated with improvement in acne symptoms. In accordance, they are in fact approved by the for the treatment of acne in women in the United States. The improvement in acne symptoms is believed to be due to a 2- to 3-fold increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and a consequent decrease in free testosterone levels caused by EE, which results in an overall decrease in androgenic signaling in the body. The sebaceous glands are highly androgen-sensitive and their size and activity are potential markers of androgenic effect. A high dosage of 20 mg/day norethisterone or NETA has been found to significantly stimulate the sebaceous glands, whereas lower dosages of 5 mg/day and 2.5 mg/day norethisterone and NETA, respectively, did not significantly stimulate sebum production and were consequently regarded as devoid of significant androgenicity. Conversely, dosages of norethisterone of 0.5 to 3 mg/day have been found to dose- dependently decrease SHBG levels (and hence to suppress hepatic SHBG production), which is another highly sensitive marker of androgenicity. A large clinical study of high to very high oral dosages of norethisterone (10 to 40 mg/day) administered for prolonged periods of time (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent miscarriage in pregnant women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild voice changes (hoarseness), acne, and hirsutism and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, virilization of the genitals. Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of norethisterone of 30 mg/day or more for a period of 15 weeks or longer. In the female infants who experienced virilization of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris. In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds occurred. The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40 mg/day. In a letter to the editor on the topic of virilization caused by high dosages of NETA in women, a physician expressed that they had not observed the \\"slightest evidence of virilization\\" and that there had \\"certainly been no hirsutism nor any voice changes\\" in 55 women with advanced breast cancer that they had treated with 30 to 60 mg/day norethisterone for up to six months. High-dosage norethisterone has been used to suppress menstruation in women with severe intellectual disability who were incapable of handling their own menses. A study of 118 nulliparous women treated with 5 mg/day norethisterone for a period of 2 to 30 months found that the drug was effective in producing amenorrhea in 86% of the women, with breakthrough bleeding occurring in the remaining 14%. Side effects including weight gain, hirsutism, acne, headache, nausea, and vomiting all did not appear to increase in incidence and no \\"disturbing side effects\\" were noted in any of the women. Another study of 5 mg/day norethisterone in 132 women also made no mention of androgenic side effects. These findings suggest little to no risk of androgenic side effects with norethisterone at a dosage of 5 mg/day. A study of 194 women treated with 5 to 15 mg/day NETA for a median duration of 13 months of therapy to suppress symptoms of endometriosis observed no side effects in 55.2% of patients, weight gain in 16.1%, acne in 9.9%, mood lability in 8.9%, hot flashes in 8.3%, and voice deepening in two women (1.0%). =Estrogenic= Norethisterone is weakly estrogenic (via conversion into its metabolite EE), and for this reason, it has been found at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high dosages (e.g., 40 mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension norethisterone) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to high dosages (above 50 Œºg/day) of EE, and that even doses of NETA of 10 to 20 mg, which correspond to EE doses of approximately 20 to 30 Œºg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk. A study also found that ethinylestradiol and norethisterone had a greater influence on coagulation factors when the dose of norethisterone was 3 or 4 mg than when it was 1 mg. This might have been due to additional ethinylestradiol generated by higher doses of norethisterone. Overdose There have been no reports of serious side effects with overdose of norethisterone, even in small children.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/016954s106lbl.pdf As such, overdose usually does not require treatment. High dosages of as much as 60 mg/day norethisterone have been studied for extended treatment durations without serious adverse effects described.  Interactions  5Œ±-Reductase plays an important role in the metabolism of norethisterone, and 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride can inhibit its metabolism. Norethisterone is partially metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly alter circulating levels of norethisterone. For instance, the CYP3A4 inducers rifampicin and bosentan have been found to decrease norethisterone exposure by 42% and 23%, respectively, and the CYP3A4 inducers carbamazepine and St. John's wort have also been found to accelerate norethisterone clearance. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Norethisterone is a potent progestogen and a weak androgen and estrogen. That is, it is a potent agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) and a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). Norethisterone itself has insignificant affinity for the ER; its estrogenic activity is from an active metabolite that is formed in very small amounts, ethinylestradiol (EE), which is a very potent estrogen. Norethisterone and its metabolites have negligible affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and hence have no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. Progestogenic activity Norethisterone is a potent progestogen and binds to the PR with approximately 150% of the affinity of progesterone. In contrast, its parent compounds, testosterone, nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and ethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone), have 2%, 22%, and 44% of the relative binding affinity of progesterone for the PR. Unlike norethisterone, its major active metabolite 5Œ±-dihydronorethisterone (5Œ±-DHNET), which is formed by transformation via 5Œ±-reductase, has been found to possess both progestogenic and marked antiprogestogenic activity, although its affinity for the PR is greatly reduced relative to norethisterone at only 25% of that of progesterone. Norethisterone produces similar changes in the endometrium and vagina, such as endometrial transformation, and is similarly antigonadotropic, ovulation- inhibiting, and thermogenic in women compared to progesterone, which is in accordance with its progestogenic activity. Androgenic activity Norethisterone has approximately 15% of the affinity of the anabolic‚Äìandrogenic steroid (AAS) metribolone (R-1881) for the AR, and in accordance, is weakly androgenic. In contrast to norethisterone, 5Œ±-DHNET, the major metabolite of norethisterone, shows higher affinity for the AR, with approximately 27% of the affinity of metribolone. However, although 5Œ±-DHNET has higher affinity for the AR than norethisterone, it has significantly diminished and in fact almost abolished androgenic potency in comparison to norethisterone in rodent bioassays. Similar findings were observed for ethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5Œ±-reduced metabolite, whereas 5Œ±-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and androgenic potency of testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, it appears that the ethynyl group of norethisterone at the C17Œ± position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5Œ±-reduction. Norethisterone (0.5 to 3 mg/day) has been found to dose-dependently decrease circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production. The drug also has estrogenic activity, and estrogens are known to increase SHBG hepatic production and circulating levels, so it would appear that the androgenic activity of norethisterone overpowers its estrogenic activity in this regard. Norethisterone is bound to a considerable extent (36%) to SHBG in circulation. Although it has lower affinity for SHBG than endogenous androgens and estrogens, Norethisterone may displace testosterone from SHBG and thereby increase free testosterone levels, and this action may contribute to its weak androgenic effects. Estrogenic activity Ethinylestradiol (EE), the metabolite of norethisterone responsible for its estrogenic activity. Norethisterone binds to the ERs, the ERŒ± and the ERŒ≤, with 0.07% and 0.01% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol. Due to these very low relative affinities, it is essentially inactive itself as a ligand of the ERs at clinical concentrations. However, norethisterone has been found to be a substrate for aromatase and is converted in the liver to a small extent (0.35%) to the highly potent estrogen EE, and for this reason, unlike most other progestins, norethisterone has some estrogenic activity. However, with typical dosages of norethisterone used in oral contraceptives (0.5 to 1 mg), the levels of EE produced are low, and it has been said that they are probably without clinical relevance. Conversely, doses of 5 and 10 mg of norethisterone, which are used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, are converted at rates of 0.7% and 1.0% and produce levels of EE that correspond to those produced by 30 and 60 Œºg dosages of EE, respectively. The levels of EE formed by 0.5 and 1 mg of norethisterone have been estimated based on higher dosages as corresponding to 2 and 10 Œºg dosages of EE, respectively. At high doses, norethisterone may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism due to metabolism into EE. Neurosteroid activity Like progesterone and testosterone, norethisterone is metabolized into 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites. Whether these metabolites of norethisterone interact with the GABAA receptor similarly to the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of progesterone and testosterone like allopregnanolone and 3Œ±-androstanediol, respectively, is a topic that does not appear to have been studied and hence requires clarification. Steroidogenesis inhibition Norethisterone is a substrate for and is known to be an inhibitor of 5Œ±-reductase, with 4.4% and 20.1% inhibition at 0.1 and 1 ŒºM, respectively. However, therapeutic concentrations of norethisterone are in the low nanomolar range, so this action may not be clinically relevant at typical dosages. Norethisterone and its major active metabolite 5Œ±-DHNET have been found to act as irreversible aromatase inhibitors (Ki = 1.7 ŒºM and 9.0 ŒºM, respectively). However, like the case of 5Œ±-reductase, the concentrations required are probably too high to be clinically relevant at typical dosages. 5Œ±-DHNET specifically has been assessed and found to be selective in its inhibition of aromatase, and does not affect cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 17Œ±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11Œ≤-hydroxylase. Since it is not aromatized (and hence cannot be transformed into an estrogenic metabolite), unlike norethisterone, 5Œ±-DHNET has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Other activities Norethisterone is a very weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (IC50 = 46 ŒºM and 51 ŒºM, respectively), but these actions require very high concentrations of norethisterone that are far above therapeutic circulating levels (which are in the nanomolar range) and hence are probably not clinically relevant. Norethisterone and some of its 5Œ±-reduced metabolites have been found to produce vasodilating effects in animals that are independent of sex steroid receptors and hence appear to be non-genomic in mechanism. Norethisterone stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins act similarly in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. Antigonadotropic effects Due to its progestogenic activity, norethisterone suppresses the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis) and hence has antigonadotropic effects. The estrogenic activity of norethisterone at high doses would also be expected to contribute to its antigonadotropic effects. Due to its antigonadotropic effects, norethisterone suppresses gonadal sex hormone production, inhibits ovulation in women, and suppresses spermatogenesis in men. The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of both oral norethisterone and oral NETA is about 0.5 mg/day in women. However, some conflicting data exist, suggesting that higher doses might be necessary for full inhibition of ovulation. An intramuscular injection of 200 mg NETE has been found to prevent ovulation and suppress levels of estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women. Early studies of oral norethisterone in men employing doses of 20 to 50 mg/day observed suppression of 17-ketosteroid excretion, increased estrogen excretion (due to conversion into ethinylestradiol), suppression of spermatogenesis, libido, and erectile function, and incidence of gynecomastia. A dosage of oral norethisterone of 25 mg/day for 3 weeks in men has been reported to suppress testosterone levels by about 70%, to 100 to 200 ng/dL, within 4 or 5 days, as well as to suppress sperm count and to have no effect on libido or erectile function over this short time period. A single 200 mg intramuscular injection of NETE alone or in combination with 2 mg estradiol valerate has been found to produce a rapid, strong, and sustained decrease in gonadotropin and testosterone levels for up to one month in men. Intramuscular injections of 200 mg NETE once every 3 weeks have also been found to suppress spermatogenesis in men. =Pharmacokinetics= The pharmacokinetics of norethisterone have been reviewed. Absorption The oral bioavailability of norethisterone is between 47 and 73%, with a mean oral bioavailability of 64%. Micronization has been found to significantly improve the oral bioavailability of norethisterone by increasing intestinal absorption and reducing intestinal metabolism. A single 2 mg oral dose of norethisterone has been found to result in peak circulating levels of the drug of 12 ng/mL (40 nmol/L), whereas a single 1 mg oral dose of norethisterone in combination with 2 mg estradiol resulted in peak levels of norethisterone of 8.5 ng/mL (29 nmol/L) one-hour post-administration. Distribution The plasma protein binding of norethisterone is 97%. It is bound 61% bound to albumin and 36% bound to SHBG. Metabolism Norethisterone has an elimination half-life of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, with a mean elimination half-life of 8.0 hours. The metabolism of norethisterone is very similar to that of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Œî4 double bond to 5Œ±- and 5Œ≤-dihydronorethisterone, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydronorethisterone. These transformations are catalyzed by 5Œ±- and 5Œ≤-reductase and 3Œ±- and 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and breast. With the exception of 3Œ±,5Œ±- and 3Œ≤,5Œ±-tetrahydronorethisterone, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of norethisterone are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of norethisterone is also converted by aromatase into EE. Norethisterone is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and sulfation) of norethisterone and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17Œ±. The ethynyl group of norethisterone is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites. Norethisterone is used in birth control pills, opposed to progesterone itself, because it is not metabolized as rapidly as progesterone when consumed orally. When progesterone is consumed orally it is rapidly metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and broken down into many different metabolites. Whereas, norethisterone is not as rapidly metabolized allowing norethisterone to be present in higher quantities allowing it to more effectively compete for progesterone receptor binding sites. Elimination Norethisterone is eliminated 33 to 81% in urine and 35 to 43% in feces. Chemistry Norethisterone, also known as 17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17Œ±-ethynylestra-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of testosterone in which an ethynyl group has been added at the C17Œ± position and the methyl group at the C19 position has been removed; hence, it is a combined derivative of ethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone) and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). These modifications result in increased progestogenic activity and oral bioavailability as well as decreased androgenic/anabolic activity. =Derivatives= Norethisterone (NET) is the parent compound of a large group of progestins that includes most of the progestins known as the 19-nortestosterone derivatives. This group is divided by chemical structure into the estranes (derivatives of norethisterone) and the gonanes (18-methylgonanes or 13Œ≤-ethylestranes; derivatives of levonorgestrel) and includes the following marketed medications: ; Estranes * Etynodiol diacetate (3Œ≤-hydroxy-NET 3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diacetate) * Lynestrenol (3-desoxy- NET) * Norethisterone acetate (NET 17Œ≤-acetate) * Norethisterone enanthate (17Œ≤-enanthate) * Noretynodrel (Œ¥5(10)-NET) * Norgestrienone (Œ¥9,11-NET) * Quingestanol acetate (NET 17Œ≤-acetate 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) * Tibolone (7Œ±-methyl-Œ¥5(10)-NET) ; Gonanes * Desogestrel (3-deketo-11-methylene-18-methyl-NET) * Etonogestrel (11-methylene-18-methyl- NET) * Gestodene (18-methyl-Œ¥15-NET) * Gestrinone (18-methyl-Œ¥9,11-NET) * Levonorgestrel (18-methyl-NET) * Norelgestromin (18-methyl-NET 3-oxime) * Norgestimate (18-methyl-NET 3-oxime 17Œ≤-acetate) * Norgestrel (13-ethyl-NET) Several of these act as prodrugs of norethisterone, including NETA, NETE, etynodiol diacetate, lynestrenol, and quingestanol acetate. Noretynodrel may also be a prodrug of norethisterone. NETA is taken by mouth similarly to norethisterone, while NETE is given by injection into muscle. Non-17Œ±-ethynylated 19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) progestins which are technically not derivatives of norethisterone (as they do not have a C17Œ± ethynyl group) but are still closely related (with other substitutions at the C17Œ± and/or C16Œ≤ positions) include the following marketed medications: * The C17Œ± vinyl (ethenyl) derivatives norgesterone (17Œ±-vinyl-Œ¥5(10)-19-NT) and norvinisterone (17Œ±-vinyl-19-NT) * The C17Œ± allyl derivatives allylestrenol (3-deketo-17Œ±-allyl-19-NT) and altrenogest (17Œ±-allyl-Œ¥9,11-19-NT) * The C17Œ± alkyl derivative normethandrone (17Œ±-methyl-19-NT) * The C17Œ± cyanomethyl derivative dienogest (17Œ±-cyanomethyl-Œ¥9-19-NT) * The C16Œ≤ ethyl derivative oxendolone (16Œ≤-ethyl-19-NT) Many anabolic steroids of the 19-nortestosterone family, like norethandrolone and ethylestrenol, are also potent progestogens, but were never marketed as such. =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of norethisterone have been published. Synthesis 1 Searle & Co). Estradiol 3-methyl ether (1, EME) is partially reduced to the 1,5-diene (2) as also occurs for the first step in the synthesis of nandrolone. Oppenauer oxidation then transforms the C17Œ≤ hydroxyl group into a ketone functionality (3). This is then reacted with metal acetylide into the corresponding C17Œ± ethynyl compound (4). Hydrolysis of the enol ether under mild conditions leads directly to (5), which appears to be noretynodrel (although Lednicer states that it is \\"etynodrel\\" in his book (which may be a synonym etynodiol); etynodrel is with a chlorine atom attached), an orally active progestin. This is the progestogen component of the first oral contraceptive to be offered for sale (i.e., Enovid). Treatment of the ethynyl enol ether with strong acid leads to norethisterone (6). In practice, these and all other combined oral contraceptives are mixtures of 1 to 2% EE or mestranol and an oral progestin. It has been speculated that the discovery of the necessity of estrogen in addition to progestin for contraceptive efficacy is due to the presence of a small amount of unreduced EME (1) in early batches of 2. This when subjected to oxidation and ethynylation, would of course lead to mestranol (3). In any event, the need for the presence of estrogen in the mixture is now well established experimentally. Synthesis 2 Norethisterone synthesis #2. Norethisterone is made from estr-4-ene-3,17-dione (bolandione), which in turn is synthesized by partial reduction of the aromatic region of the 3-O-methyl ether of estrone with lithium in liquid ammonia, and simultaneously of the keto group at C17Œ± to a hydroxyl group, which is then oxidized back to a keto group by chromium trioxide in acetic acid. The conjugated C4-C5 olefin and the carbonyl group at C3 is then transformed to dienol ethyl ether using ethyl orthoformate. The obtained product is ethynylated by acetylene in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide. After hydrochloride hydrolysis of the formed O-potassium derivative, during which the enol ether is also hydrolyzed, and the remaining double bond is shifted, the desired norethisterone is obtained. History Norethisterone was synthesized for the first time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was derived from ethisterone, and was found to possess about 20-fold greater potency as a progestogen in comparison. Norethisterone was the first highly active oral progestogen to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a progestogen) by progesterone (1934), ethisterone (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17Œ±-methylprogesterone (1949) as well as by nandrolone (1950), whereas noretynodrel (1952) and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of norethisterone. The drug was first introduced, alone as Norlutin, in the United States in 1957. Norethisterone was subsequently introduced in combination with mestranol as Ortho-Novum in the United States in 1963, and was the second progestin, after noretynodrel in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing norethisterone in combination with mestranol or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the United States. Society and culture =Generic names= Norethisterone is the and of the drug while norethindrone is its . =Brand names= Norethisterone (NET), including as NETA and NETE, has been marketed under many brand names throughout the world. =Availability= United States Norethisterone was previously available alone in 5 mg tablets under the brand names Norlutin in the United States, but this formulation has since been discontinued in this country. However, NETA remains available alone in 5 mg tablets under the brand name Aygestin in the United States. It is one of the only non-contraceptive progestogen-only drug formulations that remains available in the United States. The others include progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as well as the atypical agent danazol. Both norethisterone and NETA are also available in the United States as contraceptives. Norethisterone is available both alone (brand names Camila, Errin, Heather, Micronor, Nor-QD, others) and in combination with EE (Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, others) or mestranol (Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, others), while NETA is available only in combination with EE (Norlestrin, others). NETE is not available in the United States in any form. Research Norethisterone, as NETA and NETE, has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with testosterone in men. Long-acting norethisterone microspheres for intramuscular injection have been studied for potential use in birth control.

History  Before the passing of the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, in 1708, he transferred his authority to the Sikh Holy Scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, and the body of initiated Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth. However between 1708 and 1925, the Sikh community experienced sectarianism and no centralized authority apart from that arranged under British rule from 1849.Kalsi, Sewa Singh. 1995. \\"Problems of Defining Authority in Sikhism.\\" DISKUS 3(2):43‚Äì58. . A range of other codes and collections of tradition existed, but none represented the entire community (panth). = 1925‚Äì27 = In 1925, the Sikh Gurdwara Act was made in Punjab, legislating the establishment of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), an elected body of Sikhs, for the purpose of administering Gurdwaras. A general meeting of the SGPC was held on 15 March 1927 to establish a subcommittee with the task of producing a draft Code of Conduct. The subcommittee at the time consisted of 29 high-profile Sikhs, listed by name in the Introduction to the Sikh Rehat Maryada. = 1931‚Äì32 = A preliminary draft was circulated to Sikhs in April 1931, for comment. The subcommittee met on the 4th and 5th of October 1931, then on the 3rd and 31st of January 1932, at the Akal Takht in Amritsar. During this time the number of subcommittee members present at meetings reduced, and other people were listed as present.Singh, \\"Report of SGPC's Code of Conduct and Conventions Sub- Committee.\\" On March 1st, four members were exited from the subcommittee, and eight more were appointed. Of the four who were exited, one had died and another was excommunicated. The subcommittee met again to deliberate and consider the draft on 8 May and 26 September 1932. On 1 October, the sub- committee submitted its report to the SGPC Secretary recommending a special session of the Committee be convened to consider the final draft and approve it for acceptance. = 1933‚Äì36 = The SGPC arranged a conclave of Sikhs on 30 December, where 170 individuals attended and debated the draft. Only nine attendees where members of the original sub-committee, and the conclave ultimately failed to reach an agreement. The SGPC then received comments on the draft from a subcommittee of 50 individuals and 21 Panthic Associations (including international organisations), all of whom are listed in the Introduction to the Sikh Rehat Maryada. After nearly three years, on 1 August 1936, the broader subcommittee approved the draft, and the general body of the SGPC ratified it on 12 October 1936. Thereafter, the Rehat was implemented. = 1945 = At their meeting on 7 January 1945 the SPGC's Advisory Committee on Religious Matters recommended some changes to be made to the Code. The Advisory Committee consisted of eight individuals as listed in the Preface to the Sikh Rehat Maryada. The SGPC accepted the recommendations at their meeting on 3 February 1945. Since then, several minor updates have been made to clarify content, but no significant review has been undertaken.  Principal points  The Sikh Rehat Maryada addresses key issues such as the definition of a Sikh, personal and communal obligations such as meditation and volunteer service, rules for gurdwara services to include appropriate music and festivals, and the conduct of assorted Sikh ceremonies. = Definition of Sikh = A Sikh is defined as any person, male or female, who faithfully: * believes in the existence of One Eternal God * follows the teachings of, and accepts as their only Spiritual guides, the Guru Granth Sahib and the ten human Gurus * believes in the baptism (Amrit Sanchar), as promoted by the tenth Guru = Sikh living = There are two aspects to a Sikh living: first is the adherence to a personal discipline and the development of a strong family life; the other is the involvement in communal life and to ensure community well-being and infra-structure for support of the weak within the community local and globally. This is the practical aspect of the three pillars of Sikhism promoted by Guru Nanak called Vand Chhako ('share what you eat [or have]'). A Sikh is always to live and promote the tenets stipulated by the Gurus. * Belief in One God * Equality of All the Human race * Respect for All, irrespective of gender, age, status, color, caste, sexual orientation, etc. * Self-Control ‚Äì Kill the Five Evils; no rituals or superstitions; no gambling, tobacco, alcohol, intoxicating drugs, etc. * Self-Improvement ‚Äì Promote the Five Virtues  Communal life  In the communal life, the Sikh has a duty to actively contribute to the community outside the family unit. A sikh should undertake free voluntary service (seva) within the community at Gurdwaras, community projects, hospitals, old peoples homes, nurseries, etc. At every opportunity, a Sikh ought to dedicate their free time to voluntary community work, and devote at least 10% of their wealth in time or money to support community projects. This also includes positively supporting weaker members within the community. Time needs to be given to the greater Sikh community and the even wider world community. It is the duty of the Sikh to hold a continuous dialogue with all members of the larger community, to treat them as equals, and respect their religions and their customs. Sikhism offers strong support for a healthy community life and a Sikh must undertake to support all worthy projects which would benefit the community and promote Gurmat principles. Importance is given to inter-faith dialogue, support for the poor and weak, better community understanding and co-operation. Seva (voluntary service) is an important prominent part of the Sikh religion and all Sikhs must get involved in this communal service whenever an opportunity arises. This in its simple forms can be: sweeping and washing the floors of the Gurdwara, serving water and food (Langar) to or fanning the congregation, offering provisions or preparing food and doing other 'house keeping' duties. Guru ka Langar ('Guru's free food') is a very important part of Sikhism. When Langar is being served or when sangat is being sat down ‚ÄúSat-Naam Waheguru\\" must be chanted. The main philosophy behind the langar is two-fold: to provide training to engage in seva and an opportunity to serve people from all walks of life; and to help banish all distinctions between high and low castes.  Personal life  In their personal life, a Sikh should live humbly and with love in an extended family group encouraging Gurmat principles and offering moral support within this extended structure. A sikh should undertake free voluntary service (seva) within the community at Gurdwaras, community projects, hospitals, old peoples homes, nurseries, etc. At every opportunity, a Sikh ought to dedicate their free time to voluntary community work, and devote at least 10% of their wealth in time or money to support community projects. This also includes positively supporting weaker members within the community. Following the teachings of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh is commanded by the Gurus to lead a disciplined life and to not blindly follow rituals and superstitions that bring no spiritual or material benefit to the person or community. A Sikh must not eat meat that has been slaughtered in a ritualistic way (Kutha meat) and refrain from using all forms of intoxicants; hence, alcohol and tobacco are strictly prohibited. Sikhs must also refrain from rituals, superstitions and other anti-Sikh behavior such as gambling, etc. The Sikh is to practice and promote complete equality between the genders, castes, races, religions, etc. Apart from their spouse, a Sikh must treat all people as their kin; treat all females as daughters, sisters, or mothers, and males as sons, brothers, or fathers, depending on their age. The Sikh is to meditate on God's Name (Naam Japna or Naam Simran) and recite the holy scriptures. This includes remembering God at all times and reciting his name whenever possible. The Sikh is to arise in the early hours and recite Nitnem, a collection of Gurbani to be read in the morning (Three Banis), evening (Rehras), and night (Kirtan Sohila), followed each time with the Ardas prayer. The Ardas signifies that the Sikh need only seek the support of the Almighty Lord before beginning any new task or venture. A Sikh must also follow the principle of Kirat Karni, thereby leading their life in accordance with the Guru's teachings. This includes engaging in an honest profession, work, or course of study, as well as promoting the family way of life giving time to children in an active way so as to ensure their proper awareness of the Sikh way of life. = Meditation and scripture = Sikhs engage in personal and communal meditation, Kirtan and the study of the holy Scriptures. Meditating and understanding of the Guru Granth Sahib is important to the development of a Sikh. One should not only study Gurmukhi and be able to read Gurbani but also understand the meaning of the text. Translations and other material may be used to assist the Sikh. The Sikh should revert to the Guru Granth Sahib for the all spiritual guidance in one's life. = Congregation and Gurdwara service = It is believed that a Sikh is more easily and deeply affected by Gurbani when engaged in congregational gatherings. For this reason, it is necessary for a Sikh to visit Gurdwaras, the places where the Sikhs congregate for worship and prayer. On joining the holy congregation, Sikhs should take part and obtain benefit from the joint study of the holy scriptures. No one is to be barred from entering a Gurdwara, no matter in which country, religion, or caste he/she belongs to. The Gurdwara is open to all for the Guru's darshan (seeing the holy Guru) and Langar. However the person must not have on his/her person anything, such as tobacco or other intoxicants, which are tabooed by the Sikh religion. Shoes must be removed, one's head must be covered, and respectful clothing is a must. During service (seva) in a Gurdwara and while congregational sessions are in session, only one activity should be done at a time in one hall in the presence of the Guru‚Äîperforming of kirtan, delivering of discourse, interpretative elaboration of the scriptures, or the reading of the scriptures. Before taking a hukam from the Guru, an ardas must be done: all the congregation would stand for the ardas and then sit down and carefully listen to the Hukam of the Guru.  Kirtan  Sikhs, though anyone with correct pronunciation and understanding of Gurbani who desires to take part in the congregation, perform kirtan (spiritual hymn singing) in a congregation and only hymns (shabad) from the holy scriptural compositions in traditional musical measures should be sung. Only shabads from Guru Granth Sahib Ji Gurbani and the compositions of Bhai Gurdas and Bhai Nand Lal, may be performed. It is improper to sing kirtan to rhythmic folk tunes or popular film tunes.  Akhand Paath and Sadharan Paath  An Akhand Paath is the non-stop reading of the Guru Granth Sahib carried on during difficult times or during occasions of joy and celebration. The reading takes approximately forty eight hours of continuous and uninterrupted reading by a relay of skilled Gurbani readers. The reading must be done in a clear voice and with correct and full pronunciation. Reading the Gurbani too fast, so that the person listening in cannot follow the contents, is discouraged and is considered as disrespect for the Scriptures and the congregation (sangat). A Sadharan Paath is a non-continuous reading of the Guru Granth Sahib and one can take from seven days to many months to complete the full reading of the 1430 Anga of the text. = Festivals and ceremonies = The important Sikh festivals that are celebrated include Gurpurbs, in celebration of the birthday and other important anniversaries (martyrdom, etc.) from the lives of the Gurus; and Vaisakhi, celebration of the first Amrit Sanchar and Harvest festival. Along with other rites and conventions, Sikh ceremonies include: *Naam Karan: baby naming ceremony *Amrit Sanchar: baptism ceremony *Anand Karaj: marriage ceremony *Antam Sanskar: funeral ceremony  Other codes  Sikh Rehat Maryada is based on earlier codes (Rehat nama), including: * Tanakhah-nama (Nas√Æhatn√¢me) Samvat 1776 (1718‚Äì1719 CE), ten years after Guru Gobind Singh gave up his mortal body. * The Prahilad Rai Rehat-namab * Sakhi Rehat ki: about 1735 CE * Chaupa Singh Rehat-nama: 1740‚Äì1765 CE (1700 CE according to Piara Singh Padam). Chaupa Singh was a member of the Guru's retinue. He was entrusted with the care of infant Gobind Rai by Guru Tegh Bahadur. Some members of Chaupa Singh's family became martyrs with Guru Tegh Bahadur in Delhi and others served under the 10th Guru. * Desa Singh Rehat-nama: late 18th century * Daya Singh Rehat-nama.

WAEB-FM broadcasts at 104.1 MHz FM. History WAEB-FM signed on in 1961, initially simulcasting the Top 40 format airing on 790 WAEB. In the late 60s, WAEB FM separated from WAEB and went through several formats before eventually becoming a country music station known as WXKW. In April 1985, the station reverted to the WAEB call letters and switched to a Soft AC format, playing a small amount of adult standards artists initially as well as a few new songs. The station was known as \\"The New Light 104 WAEB-FM\\" and it was a \\"niche\\" format meant to compete with 100.7 WFMZ (which was easy listening at the time) and 96.1 WLEV (which was an automated/live assist \\"Hot AC.\\") By the early part of 1986, WAEB FM had evolved to more of a mainstream AC format, but by the late part of 1986, the station was phasing out the \\"Light\\" name and became \\"104 WAEB-FM\\", and the music mix changed to a more heavily dayparted AC/CHR mix without the hype. On January 26, 1987, the day known as when \\"The records went away\\". The station switched to a CHR format and became \\"The world's 1st ever laser hitmusic radio station!, The New Laser 104.1 WAEB-FM\\". Aptly named because 90% percent of the music (when available) was played on CD. One remnant of the station's \\"Laser Days\\" was at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, where back in 1987, their \\"Colossus\\" steel roller coaster was renamed \\"The Laser\\" until it was moved in 2008. Legendary voice man Mitch Craig was the voice of WAEB-FM in its \\"Laser 104.1\\" years. In 1991, 104.1 gradually downplayed the \\"Laser 104.1\\" moniker and identified themselves as \\"104.1 WAEB- FM.\\" In September of that year, after WHXT a.k.a. \\"Hot 99.9\\" in Easton switched to WODE better known as \\"Oldies 99.9\\", WAEB-FM's transition to \\"BDay\\" was complete. The station then became known as \\"The New B104 FM\\". The station positioned itself as \\"The New B104 FM\\" through late 1992. The late great Brian James became the new voice of WAEB-FM after Mitch, then by late 1992 the station started to play down the fact that they were \\"new\\" and then began positioning as the station that plays \\"10 songs in a row\\" and gives you \\"Everything You Need to Know\\" because of their emphasis on local news in the morning and afternoon, as well as traffic reports every 10 minutes. Ken Matthews hosted the morning show and Chuck McGee did afternoon drive. By Spring 1996, B104 was reimaged, most of the flame throwing CHR jingles from the 80's were dropped and Sean Caldwell became the new voice of WAEB-FM after Brian. The Retro 80's Buffet began at noon hosted originally by Jennifer Knight (now on 95.1 WAYV Atlantic City). In late 1996 B-104 began broadcasting Open House Party with John Garabedian on Saturday nights, after it was dropped by Pottsville's WAVT (T-102). By 1997 B104 began playing a lot more \\"softer\\" songs during the day that a lot of other CHR's didn't play (like \\"Here in my Heart\\" by Chicago), to pick up listeners who felt displaced by the signing off of A/C 96.1 WLEV in July 1997. In late 1998 B 104 began using a new jingle package, and streaming on the web.I In the 1990s during the day B 104 was Allentown's de facto Adult Contemporary station as it eliminated rap and hard rock during the day. B104 aired special edits of songs such as Green Day Holiday, Beyonce Crazy In Love And many others where the raps or spoken parts were extracted from the songs. Through the 2000s B104 had a whatever weekends to distance themselves from the repetition cliches of pop radio. In 2006, B 104 was re-imaged again, dropping Sean as the voice as well as the \\"10 in a row\\" slogan. Morning man Ken Matthews exited, and long time night guy Mike Kelly was moved to mornings, as the station then began to resemble other CHR's owned by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in markets around the country, a sound they still maintain today as a Mainstream CHR radio station. Today B104 is a Mainstream CHR that no longer \\"dayparts\\" their music. B104 relies heavily on syndicated product from their parent company iHeartMedia, along with a live and local morning show \\"Mike and Steph in The Morning\\". B104 featured the \\"Firecracker 500\\" every weekend through 2003 with the number 1 song usually being the biggest hit on the station in the last year. B 104 is a part of the iHeartRadio network. On Saturday October 20, 2012, B104 dropped Open House Party on Saturday nights and replaced it with Clear Channel's Saturday Online with Romeo. B104 is continually at the top of the 12+ ratings in the Lehigh Valley maintaining 10+ shares for almost the last 25 years. B104's signal can be heard as far North as Vernon, NJ, as far east as Clinton, NJ, as far west as Wyomissing, PA, as far north as Tamaqua, PA, and as far south as Doylestown, PA. The station's transmitter is located in Washington Township, Lehigh County, just south of Slatington on Tower Road. Signal restrictions to 104.1 FM come from WPHI 103.9 in Philadelphia, WNNK 104.1 in Harrisburg, Radio 103.9 WNBM-FM in the Bronx/NYC and WAXQ 104.3 in New York City.

The area is mainly composed of offices and apartments, with new residential and commercial developments being under construction in the area, including the shopping center Redi. The port facilities previously in the area were moved to Vuosaari Harbour in 2008.

It contains the locality of Chancellor Park, and Australia's newest university, the University of the Sunshine Coast. History The name 'Sippy' is derived from the Aboriginal word Dhippi or Jippi, a generic name for 'winged creatures' and believed to be 'a place of birds.' Sippy Downs was a part of the Moolooloo Plains pastoral run leased by John Westaway & Sons in the 1860s. In 1870 all runs ceased, and the land became available for lease. It was not occupied until 1938, when it was occupied as a perpetual lease selection until 1957. Sippy downs was then purchased by Alfred Grant. A portion was then sold onto Frank Cunning who raised cattle there until it was sold to the INVESTA property group in 2002. Brahman cattle were still on the property as it was being surveyed for the housing development. Sippy Downs was established as a suburb in 1993 following the decision by the Shire of Maroochy to rezone the area.

Thomas Gray spent most of his adult life promoting the idea of a passenger railway system for the UK and Europe.\\"Land Steam-Conveyance. OBSERVATIONS ON A GENERAL IRON-RAIL WAY;\\" originally published in Mechanic's Mag. No. 7, Oct. 11, 1823, and reprinted on pp. 142-5 of The European magazine, and London review, Volume 86, by Philological Society (Great Britain) (London 1824). He wrote \\"Observations on a General Iron Railway\\" which was first published in 1820, followed by further, and expanded, editions up to 1825. Copies of the book are in the British Library and many more in UK and US libraries in differing editions. There was at least one US library that still offered it on loan to the general public in 2005. He was a contemporary of William James, the Stephensons and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, all considered by many to be \\"Fathers of the Railways\\". It is very likely, as indicated by the sequence of events after his first edition, that Gray's first published proposals directly and significantly influenced the writings and actions of William James and the Stephensons, among many others, when they began to design and build the earliest passenger railway system in Britain. Much as today, commercial interests over-rode \\"the good of the community\\", that underpinned Gray's advocacy of a General (National) Passenger Railway, to be funded jointly by Government and Capital(ists).

He enjoyed a successful career as a science fiction illustrator, producing illustrations for famous science fiction authors such as Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, as well as a technical and scientific illustrator for clients such as The Pentagon, Hayden Planetarium, and the Massachusetts Audubon Society. Biography =Early life= Mel Hunter's life began with a troubled childhood in Oak Park, Illinois, where he was physically and psychologically abused by a humorless father. \\"He never knew his mother because she was banished from the household by his father when he was only two years old. While he never forgot the abuse, he didn't seem to dwell on it. Instead, he poured himself into his work and career,\\" said his third wife, Susan Smith-Hunter.Mel Hunter, February 2007 Hunter entered college a year early, at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. After college he held a variety of odd jobs, but finally landed a draftsman job at Northrop Aircraft Corp in California. In 1950, Hunter decided to pursue a career in art and began to teach himself illustration in his spare time. =Science Fiction Illustration= \\"Sunbathing in Space\\", 1953 With a growing understanding of the fields of astronomy, astronautics, and aviation Hunter set out to teach himself book and magazine illustration. He moved to New York City during the early 1950s, and by 1953 he had successfully sold his first color cover to Galaxy Science Fiction magazine and talked himself into a technical illustrator at Northrop Aircraft where he painted illustrations of advanced aircraft and simulated combat scenarios. During that time, the most lucrative outlet for space artists was the science-fiction genre. Along with a fertile imagination, Hunter coupled his art with realism and technical accuracy. Hunter's whimsical science fiction robots became his signature to thousands of science fiction fans; the skeletal steel robots graced the covers of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction well into the 1970s. Hunter's lonely robots were often depicted walking solo through the desolate landscapes of nuclear ruins or alien planets. Hunter was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist for the years 1960-1962. =Technical and Scientific Illustration= Sample of Mel Hunter's scientific illustration. As Hunter's science fiction career blossomed, so did his technical and scientific illustrations. Hunter's love of air and space took him from California's desert runways to Florida's seacoast launchpads to illustrate every variety of jet-age aircraft and space-age rocket imaginable‚Äîfrom X-15 to Saturn V. One of Hunter's best-known books is \\"The Missilemen\\", a photo illustrated work published in 1960 by Doubleday. Hunter visited U.S. rocket and missile sites during the late 1950s; he took all of the book's black-and-white photographs. It was a rare look inside the world of rocket scientists and engineers of the early space age. Another Hunter book, \\"Strategic Air Command\\", received the Aviation Writers' Association highest honors in 1961. \\"Mel launched a career in scientific illustration after he was an established science-fiction illustrator,\\" said Smith-Hunter. \\"He was very technically accurate and was commissioned to complete 26 paintings of celestial objects for the Hayden Planetarium in New York City.\\"Mel Hunter, June 2008 =Naturalistic Lithography= An original lithography by Mel Hunter. After 17 years of technical and scientific illustration, Hunter moved from New York to Chester, Vermont in 1967. He began creating lithographic prints depicting the natural scenes which surrounded him. The following year, he was commissioned to create a series of more than 130 watercolors of \\"Birds of the Northeast\\" by Abercrombie & Fitch Galleries and Massachusetts Audubon Society. By 1970, Hunter signed a contract with World Publishing Co. for a series of 13 ecological books for children, dealing with topics like the beginning of the earth, mankind, plants, birds, mammals and insects. In 1976, after accidental damage to his limestone lithographic drawing, Hunter began using mylar as a medium for his lithography, and published a controversial photo-illustrated article in the American Artist Magazine entitled \\"Revolution in Hand-Drawn Lithography\\". In 1984, Hunter published his seminal hardcover textbook, The New Lithography which details the \\"Mylar Method\\", still in wide use today. =Death= Although diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in the 1990s, Hunter died of bone cancer in February 2004. True to his final wish, an attempt was made to launch his cremated remains into space. A private launch, coordinated by Space Services Inc. on the New Frontier Flight was successful on May 22, 2012.

She was born in Santa Barbara, California. She was married to silent film actor Theodore Roberts. The couple met while Florence was a member of the Theodore Roberts theatrical company. They lived in Los Angeles, California at 1915 North Vine Street. Smythe was in six movies, namely The Wild Goose Chase (1915), The Fighting Hope (1915), The Voice in the Fog (1915), Common Ground (1916), The Winning of Sally Temple (1917), and The Silent Partner (1917). Contentious Divorce Florence Smythe was a party in a divorce battle which wound up in New York Supreme Court in February 1913. Theodore Roberts' first wife, Lucy Roberts, obtained a separation decree which provided $50 a week for alimony. She married the actor in Portland, Oregon in 1890. They separated in New York, New York on February 13, 1910. Roberts did not pay the alimony and was locked up in Ludlow Street jail. The first Mrs. Roberts sued Florence for $50,000, charging the actress with alienating the affections of the actor. A countersuit was filed by Miss Smythe asking a sum of $100,000. She contended the former Mrs. Roberts scandalized her by stating she furnished apartments for Theodore and advanced him money. The suit was not tried in court because the statute of limitations had run out. Sudden and Death Florence left films and the stage prior to her marriage. Her sudden death from acute indigestion, which precipitated a heart attack, was hastened by the strain of her husband's illness. Theodore Roberts collapsed in 1923 while in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Miss Smythe provided much of the care during his extended convalescence. She died at the Vine Street residence in 1925 at the age of 46.

More recently it has become famous for its caves, built by the Japanese during World War Two and for being used as a hiding place for FRETLIN freedom fighters during the Indonesian occupation. However it is important to respect and acknowledge the cultural significance of some of these sacred sites, make sure you have the permission of the locals and the Xefe suku before exploring the area. A tourism information centre has been set up in the old police station which is a striking raised structure in the centre of town. Guides from this tourism centre are available to translate, show you around and get permission to explore the area. Also accommodation arrangements can be made through the tourism centre or directly with the Salesian Madres who run a guest house out of their secondary college, Eskola Teknika Profesional Santa Maria Mazzarello.  Economy  The economy of the area is mostly rural, based on rice grown in terraced fields worked by water buffalo, or in some cases by rotary hoes or tractors. Other crops are bananas, peanuts, coffee, copra, corn and vegetables, and there are pigs, goats, chickens and a few cows and horses. Most people are subsistence farmers and they face many obstacles: low crop yields, lack of access to clean water, poor infrastructure and inadequate market access as well as low literacy and education levels.

One camp, \\"Meretz\\", did not appear on any modern Israeli maps. In 2004, Kroizer published an article in an academic journal, mentioning the prison location in a footnote. Some days later he received a phone call from Israel's military censor asking why the article had not been submitted for inspection.Secrets of Unit 1391: Uncovering an Israeli jail that specializes in nightmares, Newsweek, 27 February 2008.

It has been acknowledged by the government of Israel that \\"within the framework of a military police investigation the suspicion arose that an interrogator who questioned the complainant threatened to perform a sexual act on the complainant\\". Inmates were not allowed visits at the facility from the Red Cross, nor were any other independent organization permitted to inspect the site. The prisoners were not told where they were, nor were their families or lawyers. In 2003, in response to a lawsuit, Israeli government lawyers said that while the location was secret, Palestinians who were incarcerated there had their rights safeguarded, and could meet with lawyers and Red Cross at an off-site location. In May 2009, the United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) questioned Israeli officials about the facility and expressed skepticism about this claim.

It should ensure that all allegations of torture and ill-treatment by detainees in Facility 1391 be impartially investigated, the results made public, and any perpetrators responsible for breaches of the Convention be held accountable.\\" See also * Palestinian prisoners in Israel References Category:Human rights abuses Category:Torture in Israel Category:Military installations of Israel Category:Tegart forts Category:Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel) ","title":"Camp 1391"},{"id":"6658342","text":"Subdistrict Lolotoe Lolotoe is a city in Bobonaro District, East Timor.

A native of Waukesha, Wisconsin, Anderson played 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a linebacker for the Green Bay Packers from 1978 to 1989. He was selected as the Packers' most valuable defensive player three consecutive years. At the end of his career with the Packers, he was the team's all-time leader in tackles and was tied with Ray Nitschke for the Packers' career record in interceptions by a linebacker. Anderson was named a second-team player on the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team and was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1996. Anderson also played college football as a linebacker and defensive end for the University of Michigan from 1974 to 1977. He was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player in 1976 and a first-team All-American in 1977. In 2009, he became the linebackers coach at Carroll University. Early years Anderson was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, in 1956. He attended Waukesha South High School where he played both football and basketball. University of Michigan Anderson enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1974 and played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1974 to 1977. He was a backup outside linebacker as a freshman in 1974. He was converted to a defensive end in 1975 and started one game at that position. As a junior, Anderson started 10 games at defensive end for the 1976 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-2 and allowed opponents to score only 95 points (7.9 points per game). Anderson contributed 65 tackles and three interceptions for the 1976 Wolverines.(to retrieve information for a particular season, go to \\"Games & Totals by Season\\" and select the year for which statistics are to be retrieved) At the end of the 1976 season, Anderson received the team's Frederick Matthei Award, and he was also selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player.

According to oral tradition, King Ang Chan (1516‚Äì1566) had named the town \\"Siem Reap\\" after he repulsed an army sent to invade Cambodia by the Thai king Maha Chakkraphat in 1549. Scholars such as Michael Vickery consider this derivation to be simply a modern folk etymology, and maintain that while the names Siem Reap and Chenla. the old Chinese name for Cambodia, may perhaps be related, the actual origin of the name is unknown. The traditional tale claims that King Ang Chan of Cambodia tried to assert greater independence from Siam, which was then struggling internally. The Siamese king Chairacha had been poisoned by his concubine, Lady Sri Sudachan, who had committed adultery with a commoner, Worawongsathirat, while the king was away leading a campaign against the Kingdom of Lan Na. Sudachan then placed her lover on the throne. The Thai nobility lured them outside the city on a royal procession by barge to inspect a newly discovered white elephant. After killing the usurper, along with Sudachan and their new-born daughter, they invited Prince Thianracha to leave the monkhood and assume the throne as King Maha Chakkraphat (1548‚Äì1569). With the Thais distracted by internal problems, King Ang Chan attacked. He seized the Siamese city of Prachinburi in 1549, sacking the city and making slaves of its inhabitants. Only then did he learn that the succession had been settled and that Maha Chakkraphat was the new ruler. Ang Chan immediately retreated to Cambodia, taking captives with him. King Maha Chakkraphat was furious over the unprovoked attack, but Burma had also chosen to invade through Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese army posed a much more serious threat, as it captured Kanchanaburi and Suphanburi. It then appeared before Ayutthaya itself. The Thai army managed to defeat the Burmese, who quickly retreated through the pass. Maha Chakkraphat's thoughts then turned to Cambodia. Not only had Ang Chan attacked and looted Prachinburi, turning its people into slaves, but he also refused to give Maha Chakkraphat a white elephant he had requested, rejecting even this token of submission to Siam. Maha Chakkraphat ordered Prince Ong, the governor of Sawankhalok, to lead an expedition to punish Ang Chan and recover the Thai captives. The rival armies met, and Ang Chan killed Prince Ong with a lucky musket shot from an elephant's back. The leaderless Thai army fled, and Ang Chan allegedly captured more than 10,000 Siamese soldiers. To celebrate his great victory, King Ang Chan supposedly named the battleground \\"Siem Reap\\", meaning 'the total defeat of Siam'. Pub Street, Siem Reap In reality, surviving historic sources make this derivation appear unlikely, since they date the decline of Angkor to more than a century before this, when a military expedition from Ayutthaya captured and sacked Angkor Wat, which began a long period of vassal rule over Cambodia. The 1431 capture coincided with the decline of Angkor, though the reasons behind its abandonment are not clear. They may have included environmental changes and failings of the Khmer infrastructure. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, infighting among the Khmer nobility led to periodic intervention and domination by both of Cambodia's more powerful neighbors, Vietnam and Siam. Siem Reap, along with Battambang (Phra Tabong) and Sisophon, major cities in northwest Cambodia, was under Siamese administration and the provinces were collectively known as Inner Cambodia from 1795 until 1907, when they were ceded to French Indochina. During the 18th century, under the rule of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, it was known as Nakhon Siam ('Siam's city'). = Re- discovery of Angkor = Sivutha Boulevard downtown Siem Reap was little more than a village when French explorers such as Henri Mouhot \\"re-discovered\\" Angkor in the 19th century. However, European visitors had visited the temple ruins much earlier, including Ant√≥nio da Madalena in 1586.Higham, The Civilization of Angkor pp. 1‚Äì2. In 1901, the √âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient (EFEO) ('French School of the Far East') began a long association with Angkor by funding an expedition into Siam to the Bayon. The EFEO took responsibility for clearing and restoring the whole site. In the same year, the first Western tourists arrived in Angkor, a total of about 200 in just three months. Angkor had been \\"rescued\\" from the jungle and was assuming its place in the modern world. Grand Hotel d'Angkor, built in the mid-1920s. With the acquisition of Angkor by the French in 1907 following a Franco-Siamese treaty, Siem Reap began to grow. The Grand Hotel d'Angkor opened in 1929 and the temples of Angkor became one of Asia's leading draws until the late-1960s, when civil war kept tourists away. In 1975, the population of Siem Reap, like all other Cambodian cities and towns, was driven into the countryside by the communist Khmer Rouge. Siem Reap's recent history is colored by the horror of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime. Since Pol Pot's death in 1998, however, relative stability and a rejuvenated tourist industry have revived the city and province. Royal Residence, Siem Reap Siem Reap now serves as a small gateway town to the world heritage site of Angkor Wat. In recent years, the city has regularly ranked in the top ten for \\"Best Destination\\" lists produced by entities such as TripAdvisor, Wanderlust Magazine, and Travel+Leisure. The wat and the river A covered pedestrian bridge over the Siem Reap River, next to the Old Market in Siem Reap Siem Reap is a cluster of small villages along the Siem Reap River. These villages were originally developed around Buddhist pagodas (wats) which are almost evenly spaced along the river from Wat Preah En Kau Sei in the north to Wat Phnom Krom in the south, where the Siem Reap River meets the great Tonl√© Sap Lake. Town centre is concentrated around Sivutha Street and the Psar Chas area (Old Market area) where there are old colonial buildings, shopping and commercial districts. The Wat Bo area is now full of guesthouses and restaurants while the Psar Leu area is often crowded with jewelry and handicraft shops, selling such items as rubies and woodcarving. Other fast developing areas are the airport road and main road to Angkor where a number of large hotels and resorts can be found. Economy Dancer performing for tourists at a restaurant Tourism is a very important aspect of the economy of Siem Reap ‚Äì it was estimated in 2010 that over 50% of jobs in the town were related to the tourism industry. The city has seen a massive increase in tourist exchange in the couple of decades after the end of the Khmer Rouge era, and businesses centered on tourism have flourished due to the tourism boom. Visitor numbers were negligible in the mid-1990s, but by 2004, over half a million foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap Province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia. By 2012, tourist numbers had reached over two million.

He made only two league appearances in his first season at the club, but by 1893‚Äì94, he had established himself in the Rangers team, missing just one of the 18 league fixtures. During that season he was also responsible for bringing Alex Smith (who came from the same village but was not a relation) to the club, and the winger went on to become an important member of the side for the next 20 years. Smith was part of Rangers' first ever Scottish Cup win in 1894, playing in all six games, including the 3‚Äì1 final win over Celtic. He formed an effective partnership in the defence alongside Jock Drummond for over a decade, and made over 300 competitive appearances. Smith was also capped at international level, making 12 appearances for Scotland, two as captain. He also represented the Scottish League XI nine times. In January 1905, aged 31, Smith died from enteric fever, an illness which also caused his wife's simultaneous death.

Located 35 km from Galway, 27 km from Tuam, 30 km from Ballinasloe, and 20 km from Athenry, it forms part of the civil parish of Killascobe. History Historically, Menlough was in the Barony of Hymany which was a stronghold of the O'Mannion clan. The ruins of an O'Mannion castle are located in the fields behind the grotto in the centre of the village. Another O'Mannion castle in the parish is better known as there are more extensive ruins. This second ruin is known as Garbally Castle. It is visible to travellers from Galway to Menlough as they pass through Skehana (half parish of Menlough). Other historical monuments include the Catholic parish church of St Marys constructed in 1847, on land granted by the Ffrench family local landlords based in Monivea. Tradition has it that the roof, while under construction, was blown off during the night of the big wind in 1847. Beside the church is a building that was once an RIC barracks. It was burnt down in 1922 during the War of Independence, but later became a Garda Station. It is now a private house. An old IRA monument, erected in the 1990s stands in the centre of the village. The city of Menlo Park, California was founded in 1851 by Dennis J. Oliver and D.C. McGlynn, two Irishmen from Menlough, Ireland that had emigrated. Development A number of new houses have built in the area to accommodate the growing population of this rural location. There is an expanding commuter population living here in the area. There are three pubs in the parish; one is located in Menlough village, one in the townland of Guilka and one in Skehana. There is also one shop. Education The parish has two national schools. These are at Garbally (next to the castle) and in Menlough village. The latter school, Menlough National School (also known as Scoil Mhuire Naofa) is a co-educational (mixed) primary school, which had 77 pupils as of November 2009. Sport Menlough GAC is the local GAA club and participates in the Galway Football Championship. The club has a number of County Championships to its name at various grades.

Son of Hon. Arthur Cornwallis Ponsonby (1856‚Äî1918; 4th son of Walter Ponsonby, 7th Earl of Bessborough) and Kathleen Eva Sillery (d. 1944). Born in Gravesend, Kent, Ponsonby was educated at Eton and Oxford University, but did not get into the team in either case.Obituaries in 1945. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1946. He made his first-class debut against Leicestershire in July 1911, and immediately made an impact: batting at number eleven, he scored a vital 31 not out in the first innings to help add 61 for the last wicket and set Worcestershire up for a three-wicket victory. He also took four catches in the match, his first career dismissal being that of Cecil Wood. Ponsonby played only once more that summer, but the following year he made the only first-class fifty of his career, scoring exactly 50 not out for Worcestershire against Surrey, this time batting at seven. However, this was something of a false dawn where his batting was concerned: he did not play again for the county until 1920 (though he batted at five for MCC against Oxford University in 1914), and his Worcestershire batting average never again broke into double figures for a season. In 1920 Ponsonby returned to first- class cricket, and in his first game, against Sussex, even went in first wicket down in the second innings. He made a duck, and not long afterwards he had returned to what was to become his accustomed place near or at the bottom of the order. His wicket-keeping was more of a success, though it took him until mid-June 1921 to record his first stumping, that of Edward Solb√© of Kent. With one exception, Ponsonby played only a handful of matches in his remaining seven season in the game, doing little with either bat or gloves. That exception was 1927, when he played 26 times and acted as captain, replacing Maurice Jewell. Ponsonby made 34 dismissals (30 caught, four stumped) that year, by some distance his greatest tally for a single summer. He also recorded his highest season's run total, although this was a mere 208 at an average of only 6.30. He was to play only one more first-class match, against Nottinghamshire in late August 1928. This was a chastening year for Worcestershire: in 30 County Championship matches they won not a single game, and against a Nottinghamshire side containing Larwood, Voce and Staples they were thrashed by an innings and 21 runs. Ponsonby made a pair, but he did manage one final dismissal when he caught Notts' opener George Gunn off the bowling of Charles Tarbox. Ponsonby died in St John's Wood, London at the age of 55. Three of Ponsonby's great-uncles played first-class cricket. John, 5th Earl of Bessborough, played five games in the 1830s; Frederick, the 6th Earl, played more than 70 games between 1834 and 1856, and was a founder of both Surrey and I Zingari; while Spencer appeared over 60 times between 1841 and 1862.

The harbour has a total land area of 150 hectares, including 90 hectares of land reclaimed by filling the sea. There is also a 75-hectare business park next to the harbour. The harbour project also included the extension of Ring III to the new seaport and a new railway line to be used for transporting goods in and out of the harbour. The Vuosaari harbour was built on the site of the former Vuosaari shipyard.

Childs (born Moishe Chilovsky; 1902‚Äì1991) was an American political activist and American Communist Party functionary who became a Soviet espionage agent (1929) and then a double agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1952) until leaving both services by 1982. Beginning in 1958, Childs acted as a secret courier on behalf of the American party, briefing Soviet officials on political affairs in the American party and carrying funds to support the American Communist movement from Moscow to New York City, reporting details all the while to his FBI handlers. Over the course of two decades of activity in this role, Childs played a major part in the transfer of more than $28 million in Soviet subsidies to the American movement. For his activity as a courier on behalf of the Soviet government, Childs was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1975. His work as a spy for the American intelligence community was recognized in 1987 when Childs (together with his brother Jack) was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. Biography =Early years= Morris H. Childs was born Moishe Chilovsky on June 10, 1902, in Kiev, Russian Empire, the son of an ethnic Jewish family. The family spoke Russian in the home, not Ukrainian or Yiddish.John Barron, Operation SOLO: The FBI's Man in the Kremlin. Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing Co., 1996; pg. 22. Morris's father, Josef Chilovsky, engaged in revolutionary activities against the Tsarist regime, for which he was imprisoned and subsequently exiled to Siberia.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 18. Josef was able to flee Russia via the Black Sea and he emigrated to the United States, landing in Galveston, Texas, in March 1910. Josef Chilovsky moved to Chicago, where he worked as a cobbler and bootmaker. As soon as his living situation was established and a small sum of money raised, Josef sent for his wife, Nechame Chilovsky, and their boys, including Moishe and Jakob. The family arrived at Ellis Island in December 1911.Clyde Tolson, \\"Background Data Regarding Development of CG 5824-S [Morris Childs] as FBI Informant and his Subsequent Advancement to National Leadership Position in Communist Party USA,\\" memorandum to J. Edgar Hoover, March 12, 1959, pg. 1. Published in \\"FBI SOLO Files - March 1958 to August 1960.\\" Washington, DC: Federal Bureau of Investigation, August 2011; part 10, pdf pg. 1350. The family name was Americanized from Chilovsky to \\"Childs\\" in Chicago. Morris, as Moishe was now known, attended a demanding Jewish school in the city and worked in his father's shoemaking shop and as a messenger in the Chicago financial district. Childs read extensively, favoring particularly works of literature and history, and took courses at the Chicago Institute of Art. There he was exposed to radical ideas among his peers, echoing the dissent which his father felt towards the autocracy in imperial Russia. =Communist Party career= The Russian Revolution of 1917 was a source of great inspiration to the entire Childs family, and news of its dramatic events were breathlessly followed over the next several years.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 19. Towards the end of the decade Childs joined a trade union in order to get a job driving a milk delivery wagon, where he first made the acquaintance of members of the then-underground American Communist movement. The combination of his family's radical heritage, the exciting news from Russia, and the enthusiasm of his radical peers caused Morris Childs to become politically engaged, and he took the step of joining the United Communist Party of America in 1921.Some sources wrongly report the date of Childs' party membership as 1919, based confusion over Childs' later (erroneous) claims of having been considered a \\"charter member\\" despite joining the Communist movement in 1921, rather than the foundation year of 1919. Childs' biographer, John Barron, should be regarded as definitive on his date of party membership ‚Äî 1921. See: Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 19. During the bitter factional war within the American communist movement throughout the decade of the 1920s, Childs was a consistent supporter of the Chicago-based faction led by William Z. Foster, head of the party's trade union operations.Daily Worker, February 14, 1929, pg. 3. From the middle-1920s onward Childs was a proteg√© and friend of the man who help bring the famous union organizer Foster into the Communist Party's orbit, Earl Browder. When in 1928 the Communist International sent Browder on a dangerous mission to China as a representative of the Communist International's trade union organizing section, the Profintern, Browder left his prized library and papers with Childs, telling him before he left, \\"if I don't come back, they're yours.\\"Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 20. In 1929 Childs was selected by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) to attend the elite International Lenin School in Moscow, a training school for professional revolutionaries.Lora Soroka and Xiuzhi Zhou, \\"Register of the Morris Childs Papers, 1938-1995,\\" Palo Alto, CA: Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University, 1999. Early in 1930, Childs was approached by an agent of the Soviet secret police, the OGPU, who had noted in Childs' file that he had helped to successfully identify a police spy in the Communist organization of Chicago.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 23. The man asked Childs to become an informer for the agency to help keep tabs on the ideological foibles of his Lenin School comrades. Childs agreed with the request and thereafter provided periodic reports.Barron, Operation SOLO, pp. 23-24. During his second year at the Lenin School, Childs made the personal acquaintance of a number of high- level Soviet officials who taught courses at the school, including exiled Finnish revolutionary leader Otto Kuusinen and a young ideology expert named Mikhail Suslov.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 24. Childs remained at the Lenin School until 1932. He remained a lifelong friend of Suslov, later a top expert in relations with foreign Communist Parties under Soviet leaders Iosif Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, and Leonid Brezhnev. When he returned to the United States in 1933, a young Moscow-trained functionary on the rise, Childs went to work for a Communist Party organization now headed by his old Chicago acquaintance, Earl Browder. Childs was assigned the role of paid sub-district organizer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Childs was subsequently moved to Illinois, where he served as State Secretary of the CPUSA for Illinois.Special Committee on Un- American Activities, House of Representatives, Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX: Communist Front Organizations, with Special Reference to the National Citizen Political Action Committee. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 766. Childs was a candidate for public office for the Communist Party, running for US Congress in an Illinois at-large district in 1936.Communist Party of Illinois, Platform of the Communist Party, State of Illinois, for the Elections November, 1936. Chicago: Communist Party Election Committee, n.d. [1936]; pg. 8. Childs was also a member of the CPUSA's governing Central Committee. Morris Childs remained a leading party worker in Illinois through 1945. In December 1945, Childs was named editor of The Daily Worker, the official English-language newspaper of the Communist Party published in New York City and a member of the CPUSA's governing National Committee. In 1947 Childs, who, having attended the Lenin School was a fluent speaker of Russian, traveled to Moscow on an unspecified mission for the Communist Party, stopping off in France during the return trip to have a conversation with Jacques Duclos, the French Communist Party leader whose 1945 published criticism of the policies of American leader Earl Browder had ultimately lead to his ouster.David J. Garrow, The FBI and Martin Luther King, Jr.: From \\"SOLO\\" to Memphis. New York: WW Norton, 1981; pg. 35. Childs, a supporter of a majority faction headed by Eugene Dennis was a target of a hardline minority group which included William Z. Foster, Robert Thompson, and Benjamin Davis, used the Daily Worker editor's absence to engineer an ouster, which the Dennis group assented to in an attempt to calm troubled waters with the minority. Childs was surprised with the fait accompli at the June 27, 1947, plenary meeting of the National Committee, at which he was forced to resign the editorial post, ostensibly due to the heart ailment which plagued him. Exacerbating the situation, Childs was not even informed of Dennis's decision that he was to be removed until the matter was brought up at the meeting. On Dennis's motion, Childs was given an indefinite leave of absence as Daily Worker editor, replaced by Spanish Civil War veteran Johnny Gates. Childs returned home to Chicago, smarting from his comrades' betrayal, and discontinued further party activities, citing reasons of health. =Jack Childs= Morris's younger brother Jakob \\"Jack\\" Childs was also a Communist. He, too, benefited from General Secretary Earl Browder's patronage, with Browder seeing to Jack's appointment as the business manager of the Young Communist League in New York City in 1931.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 25. In 1932 Browder tapped Jack Childs to attend the Lenin school to be trained as a communications expert, since the Comintern now sought those holding American passports because of their versatility. Whereas Morris had been trained for work as a top party functionary and excelled in Moscow, Jack's training was more specialized and he was not a top student. He nevertheless proved himself courageous and useful as a courier transporting money to the Communist Party of Germany in Nazi Germany on behalf of the Comintern in 1933.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 26. Upon his return to the United States Jack was put to work at the side of Earl Browder at party headquarters in New York City, acting as chauffeur, personal assistant, and bodyguard.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 28. This proximity to Browder was a blessing when the \\"man from Kansas\\" was General Secretary of the CPUSA but became a curse in 1945 when Browder was removed from his leadership position and expelled from the party, ostensibly for his \\"revisionism\\". As a so-called \\"Browderite\\", Childs also lost his party job, instead making use of his former radio training to open a small electrical and painting supply store in New York City.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 42. Jack Childs dropped out of the Communist Party in 1947 and spent his time and money taking care of his physically ailing brother as best he was able.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 43. His sudden lack of party activity generated a routine September exploratory visit by two special agents of the FBI in an effort to gauge his level of disaffection and to see whether he might be a willing source of information about the top levels of the Communist Party. Jack was happy to lend assistance to the FBI, declaring to them that he \\"never really believed any of that communist bullshit\\" and that he had been active in the Communist Party merely for the sake of his brother, who had been a true believer and a figure of authority.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 44. Now Morris had been abandoned, fired from his job and left penniless, stricken by a heart attack and seemingly near death. He had begun to question everything. When his FBI interlocutors intimated to Jack Childs their desire to infiltrate the top level of the Communist Party with an informant, Jack had a potential solution, declaring \\"Morris is your ticket to the top.\\" =Courier and informer= Secret FBI informant Morris Childs and CPUSA leader James E. Jackson, Jr. at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, January 1959. One day in April 1952, Special Agent Carl Freyman of the Chicago office of the FBI made a successful appeal to Morris Childs to go to work as a secret government informant.Barron, Operation SOLO, pp. 45-48. Acting on its own authority, the Chicago office undertook to pay for Morris's treatment at the Mayo Clinic, managing to restore him physically.Barron, Operation SOLO, pp. 48-49. Over the next several years ‚Äî a period during which the Communist Party was forced into retreat by the combined forces of government action and the public antipathy that was part and parcel of the Second Red Scare ‚Äî the Childs brothers worked themselves back into the good graces of top party leaders. The oblique communications between the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and the United States forced upon the Americans by the Smith Act proved inefficient and ineffectual and in 1956 the FBI learned that a move was planned to reestablish direct ties between Moscow and New York. Childs was picked as the secret FBI informant with the greatest likelihood of being named by the CPUSA's leadership as liaison between the Soviet and American Communist Parties. The FBI did their best to steer their informant towards this sensitive new position. This effort was rewarded in July 1957, when CP leader Eugene Dennis told Childs to begin making preparations to covertly travel to Moscow as the representative of the Secretariat of the CPUSA. In 1958, Childs made the first of what would ultimately be 52 secret trips to Moscow on behalf of the Communist Party USA,Richard Gid Powers, \\"Double Agent,\\" New York Times, April 21, 1996. bringing information on affairs in the turbulent American party and making arrangements for the delivery of cash for its support from the International Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Childs was one of two delegates to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, held in Moscow from January 27 to February 5, 1959. Joining Childs in the Soviet Union as an official representative of the American Communist Party was James E. Jackson, Jr., husband of Esther Cooper Jackson. The CPSU held Childs in great esteem. In 1975, in honor of his 75th birthday, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev hosted a banquet in Childs' honor at the Kremlin, where he quietly presented him with a medal, the Order of the Red Banner, for the services which he performed conducting funds on behalf of the CPSU's international department.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 4. Childs undertook his last mission to Moscow in 1977. Over the course of his two decades as a courier, Childs was instrumental in helping with the transfer of over $28 million from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Communist Party of the USA to help fund its activities.John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, In Denial: Historians, Communism and Espionage. San Francisco: Encounter Books, 2003; pg. 69. Each and every transaction was painstakingly reported by Childs to his FBI handlers, along with information about affairs in the Soviet and American communist parties, as well as inside information about the international communist movement. Childs remained on the FBI's payroll until his retirement in 1982. Owing to the sensitivity and critical importance of his mission only a very small group inside the FBI knew of Childs' identity and the Bureau further minimized the size by keeping four agents in the Chicago and New York field offices solely on Operation SOLO for 13 years or more ‚Äî with Special Agent Walter Boyle putting in a full 20 years on the Childs case.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. 12. Never before or since in the FBI's history has it kept agents on a single case for such a protracted period. In honor of their services rendered to the United States government as secret FBI informers, in 1987 Morris and Jack Childs were each awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan, with Jack's award coming posthumously.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. xiii. =Death and legacy= Morris Childs died June 5, 1991, just five days short of his 89th birthday. In 1962 Morris was married to Eva Childs, who often took part in his frequent trips to Moscow and was herself an FBI informant.Barron, Operation SOLO, pg. xiv. Morris Childs' papers are held by the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Additional material relating to Morris Childs is to be found in the John Barron papers, also held by the Hoover Institution Archives. Barron, a former editor at Reader's Digest magazine, was the author of a book on Operation SOLO which was published in 1996 and accumulated copious materials on the post-World War II CPUSA during the course of his research.Lora Soroka and Xiuzhi Zhou, \\"Register of the John Barron Papers, 1927-1996,\\" Palo Alto, CA: Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University, 1999.

The first 3 digits of the postal code in the area are B3V. History Ferguson's Cove: a view from the water.First settled in 1788 by William Glazebrook. It was initially known as Falkland, named after Lady Falkland, wife of Lucius Bentinck Falkland, one of the Lieutenant Governors of Nova Scotia. The Lynch family from Ireland settled in 1803. Another of the earliest settlers was William Embley from Newfoundland, who served in the Royal Navy. He relocated to Ferguson's Cove after being discharged in 1811. The community was connected to Spryfield, a community further inland on the Chebucto Peninsula, by a road which began at the foot of the steep hill just to the north of York Redoubt, and ended in the Roach's Pond area of Spryfield. This is now a footpath which is seldom used, and slowly reverting to a natural state ‚Äì but still easily followed and well worth the time to hike. The Ferguson's Cove entrance is just south of an old quarry, while the Sprfield entrance is behind the sewer treatment plant at the end of Princeton Ave. There were several slate quarries in the community in the early 20th century, but none are active today. Many of the men of the community in its early days made their living as harbour pilots. By the latter part of the 20th century, however, it had become a \\"bedroom community\\" for Halifax. It is still a sparsely-settled area, but much development has taken place in the past 30 years, especially on the upper end of the housing market. =Fire of 2009= A notable recent event in the community's history (other than the Hell's Angels having an informal \\"club house\\" in part of the ruined fortifications by the ocean at the end of the road which goes past York Redoubt ‚Äì in the late 1970s and early '80s), was the fire of 1 and 2 May 2009. The fire started in the vicinity of Roach's Pond in Spryfield, and spread rapidly to the Ferguson's Cove area, aided by high winds and much dry debris from Hurricane Juan, which has made much of the HRM region prone to greater forest fire damage than normal. It caused the closure of both Herring Cove and Purcell's Cove Roads, and forced the evacuation of almost 1500 people, mostly in the Ferguson's Cove area, where 8 houses were completely destroyed and a dozen others badly damaged. It burned about in all, and was the worst fire in the area since 1964 when severe fires burned large portions of the forested area of Spryfield. Nobody was seriously injured in the blaze. Military presence Due to the elevation in the area and its subsequent overview of the approaches to Halifax Harbor the high bluffs from Ferguson's Cove to Chebucto Head have been used as defensive positions for the city at least as far back as 1793. In addition, the Navy operates Damage Control Training Facility Kootenay just south of the fort, its grounds containing the former training battery for York Redoubt at Sandwich Point. =Fort York Redoubt= A large coastal defense fort called York Redoubt was established in the community in 1793, it was active through both World Wars and ceased operations in 1956. The fort is now a National Historic Site.

She is a martial artist created by writer Chuck Dixon and artist Staz Johnson, and she first appeared in Robin #49 (1998). Detailed history Dava Sb√∂rsc's homeland of Tbliska was left in ruins by a long and bloody civil war, with the country being divided into the two countries Krasna-Volny and Transbelvia, neither of which acknowledges its neighbor as a true country. Both sides committed numerous atrocities in the war, which left thousands dead. When very young, Dava joined the Transbelvian army and pledged herself to hunting down and killing the worst killers in the Krasna-Volnian army. Being fast but small, Dava realized she would have to end any combat quickly if she was to win. To that end, she committed herself to learning all \\"single-blow techniques\\" - martial arts attacks that can defeat a foe with a single attack. She had mastered almost all known single-blow attacks (including \\"The Scalpel\\", \\"The Wind Through the Reeds\\", \\"The Lion's Paw\\", \\"Wave and Shore\\" and \\"The Skullcrack\\") when she sought out The Master of the Iron Hand, to learn his technique \\"The Whispering Hand\\". While learning from the Iron Master, she encountered Tim Drake (Robin), who was also studying with the Master at the time. She greatly impressed Robin, defeating him in a sparring match with astonishing speed. Robin, in turn, impressed her when he skillfully dispatched a thief seeking to take the dojo's texts. Dava confided in Robin that she also intended to seek out Lady Shiva to learn the Leopard Blow technique. Tim was greatly troubled by this, as he had met Shiva in the past and knew what a ruthless killer she was. Shiva, meanwhile, had become interested upon discovering the existence of a master of single blow attacks. Dava had previously killed the crew of a ship carrying weapons to Krasna-Volny, killing each crew member with one of her techniques. This allowed Shiva to track Dava to the Master of the Iron Hand's dojo. Dava, having learned the Whispering Hand, had already left to return to Transbelvia. When Shiva arrived at the dojo, she challenged the Iron Master (whose brother, The Armless Master she had killed previously, during the Knightfall storyline) when he would not reveal Dava's identity or whereabouts. Realizing that he was helpless against Shiva, Robin followed the Iron Master's wishes and left the Master to battle Shiva. Shiva soon killed the Iron Master in combat, but was stalled enough to give Tim a head start in tracking down and warning Dava. Dava had returned to her homeland, where Sir Edmund Dorrace (the ruthless drug lord arms dealer and blind martial artist King Snake) was supplying the Krasna-Volnian army with weapons to wipe out Dava's country of Transbelvia. The ship whose crew Dava had killed earlier had been carrying a shipment from Sir Edmund to Krasna- Volvy, and she had destroyed the weapons, forcing Sir Edmund to accompany the next shipment to guarantee its safety. Robin, meanwhile, had tracked Dava down, only to find that she was unconcerned about Shiva. Still wishing to protect Dava from Shiva (Tim was troubled during this period because he had recently failed to save a life), he was forced to accompany her on a mission to fight Dvak Tvorakovich, a Krasna-Volvian General who had killed entire Transbelvian villages during the war. When they confronted the General the two were immediately surrounded by armed guards. However, Dava kissed Robin at that point, and to Robin's surprise, he immediately found himself super-fast and super-strong, allowing him to defeat the armed guards with ease. Dava used the oil of the Aramilla plant on herself, which gave her superhuman speed and agility (and possibly strength, although this is unclear), and some of this had been transferred in the kiss. Shiva arrived right after the troops had been defeated and the General had fled, and challenged Dava to a death match. Robin attempted to save Dava, but since he was still under the effects of the Aramilla plant, he did not realize his own speed and strength, and accidentally killed the normally unbeatable Shiva. Dava was unmoved, although Robin was furious with her for making him break his oath to never take a life. At that point, King Snake arrived with more armed Kransa-Volvian troops, seeking to avenge his earlier losses at Robin's hands. Robin resuscitated Shiva, but in the process, transferred some of the Aramilla drug to her, briefly giving her superhuman speed and agility. Although King Snake escaped, Shiva quickly killed the troops, meanwhile General Tvorakovich was killed in an explosion he had intended for his ally King Snake. Feeling that there was no more he could do, Robin left Dava, who angrily defended her path of vengeance-murder as he departed. Appearance Dava's design is clearly intended to resemble Robin's, emphasizing the similarities between the characters. Her costume is made up of elements more in keeping with the real world than Robin's (such as a trenchcoat instead of a cape, and war paint on her face instead of a mask). Aside from their different genders, the most obvious (and possibly symbolic) difference in their designs is their hair, with Robin's being dark, and Dava's hair being red.

Pavel Krava≈ô (c. 1391 ‚Äì 23 July 1433), or Paul Crawar, Paul Craw, was a Hussite emissary from Bohemia who was burned at the stake for heresy at St Andrews in Scotland on 23 July 1433. He was the first of a succession of religious reformers who were martyred in the town during the course of the subsequent Protestant Reformation. (The others being: Patrick Hamilton in 1528, Henry Forest in 1533, George Wishart in 1546, and Walter Myln in 1558). Pavel Krava≈ô was probably a native of Krava≈ôe, Opava District, Silesia (then Moravia), now part of the Czech Republic. After studying medicine at the University of Montpellier, he graduated as Master of Arts from the University of Paris in 1415. The following year, he entered the Faculty of Arts at the University of Prague, then a hotbed of Hussite activity. Around 1421, with the University now in decline, Pavel Krava≈ô left Prague to become a physician in the service of the Polish King, W≈Çadis≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (Jogaila). He probably returned to the Bohemian capital in 1432 prior to undertaking his ill-fated mission to Scotland. His journey to St Andrews, at the time the ecclesiastical centre of Scotland and the location of its only university, was most likely made in a vain attempt to gain allies, hopefully amongst Lollard sympathisers, for the Hussite cause at the Council of Basel, at which reconciliation was sought between the Hussites and the Catholic Church. Pavel Krava≈ô's activities in St Andrews evidently met with the displeasure of the authorities there, particularly Henry Wardlaw, Bishop of St Andrews, who accused him of spreading the heretical ideas of Jan Hus and John Wyclif. At his trial he defended himself with skill and courage, but was nevertheless condemned and died, according to John Knox, with a brass ball stuffed in his mouth to prevent him addressing the people. Pavel Krava≈ô's execution is believed to have taken place at the centre of the market square in St Andrews, close to the former location of the Mercat Cross which is now marked with a cross of red stones set into the cobbled surface of the roadway.

The game may be considered a variation of Whist, or a version of Spades. History Tarneeb was probably inspired by Iranians and many other Arabic card games, though many different nations throughout the Middle East claim that Tarneeb was created in their respective countries. Historically Tarneeb can be traced back to the Levant, more specifically Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine, however the game seems to have truly flourished only from the early 18th century on. The game The aim of tarneeb is to win a set of continuous hands. There are four players in partnerships of two teams. A standard 52 card deck is used, each suit ranking in the usual way from Ace (high) down to two (low). The game is played in a counterclockwise fashion. The teams stay together for all the games of a set. In tarneeb tournament, at the end of a set, the losing team is replaced for the next set.Hugh Miles, Playing Cards in Cairo, pg. 1, Abacus Software (2008) The two members of each team are seated across each other, often on a table in such a way that no player can see the cards of other players (see seating charting image). Either player of a team may collect the winning tricks. The first dealer is chosen at random and after each hand the turn to deal passes to the right. The cards are shuffled then cut by the player to the dealer's left, and are all dealt out beginning with player to the dealer's right, one at a time or in groups of thirteen (13), so that everyone has 13 cards. Bidding Tarneeb seating arrangement. The bidding begins with the first player to the right of the dealer and continues counter- clockwise. It consists of a number of tricks seven or above. A bid of more tricks outranks any bid of fewer tricks. Each person can bid once, yet if any other player bids higher, one has the privilege of raising their bid, except in the case of passing a bid, wherein one is excluded from the bidding process. *Some players use the option of telling their partner how good their cards are i.e., helpful, not helpful at all. Playing The objective of the bidding team is to take at least the number of tricks that they bid. The objective of the other team is to hinder the declarer team from reaching their declared bid. The individual declarer leads to the first trick. Players counterclockwise must follow suit if they can; a player who has no cards of the suit led can play any card. A trick is won by the highest tarneeb (trump) in it, if any. If there are no tarneebs in the trick, the highest card of the suit led wins it. The winner of a trick leads to the next. =Playing exceptions= *In some regions, the declarer must start the first trick with his declared tarneeb suit. But in most cases they don't. Scoring Once all thirteen tricks are played, the scores of the two sides are calculated by adding the tricks each side has won. If the declarer team meets or exceed the number of bidded tricks, then they get the number of tricks they have, otherwise, they lose the bid number (subtracted from their score) and the opposing team gains the number of tricks that they have collected their own in score. It is possible, therefore, to have a negative score at some point. The set ends when one of the teams reaches forty-one (41) and the losing team is replaced for the next set. A team can also win the game by either bidding or making a set of 13 tricks. =Scoring exceptions= *In some regions, a set ends when a team reaches 31 or 61 rather than 41. *A team can not win if 13 tricks are won if a lower bet was offered (in Falamanki Dubai as per Mr. Rabih) *A team can not win if their current score is below 0 Game strategies *Keep Tarneeb Count: Every player should know how many tarneebs are out and how many are left at any point in the game. This is most crucial for the declarer who should always know how many tarneebs are out. *Tashleeh: If you are the declarer, try to eliminate as many tarneebs from the game as possible. *Ta'leem: If your partner is the declarer and you run out of tarneebs, signal to your partner what suit you want him to follow on the next trick by using a low card of that suit. *Hints: If you want your partner to return the same suit on the next turn, slam the card on the table as you play. Note that this practice is not allowed in some areas and generally frowned upon as not very professional behavior. *Na'f: When you finish a suit, throw the last card with a (flick) which hints your partner. This also is not always allowed. *Second Lowest/Third Highest: for any trick, a good rule of thumb is for the second player to use the lowest card, and the third player to use the highest card.

At the 2016 census, Fish Creek and the surrounding area had a population of 827. History Fish Creek was first settled in 1886. The Post Office opened on 6 October 1890 next to the proposed railway which arrived in 1892. In 1900 a community hall was built where the Butter Factory building stands today. This hall was used as a church by everyone until in 1904 a new Catholic church was built. Not long after that the Union Church was opened and since then the town has had two churches. The Great South Gippsland Railway line closed to passengers in 1980 for all stations past Leongatha. However freight and goods traffic continued until the line was formally closed in 1994. The tracks were removed and a combined bike, pedestrian and horse riding track, known as The Great Southern Rail Trail, was established along the former rail line. The town today Fish Creek has a number of art galleries and craft shops catering to locals as well as tourists who pass through town on their way to Wilsons Promontory. Artist and children's author Alison Lester and botanical artist Celia Rosser have galleries in the town. The Fish Creek Community Garden has been established on the disused railway platform in the centre of town. The Fish Creek Memorial Hall was built in 1930. The hall is used as a venue for parties, funerals, church services, film screenings, markets and school concerts. The hall also houses an Op shop, and its profits partially fund the maintenance and enhancement of the hall facilities. Fish Creek and District Primary School caters for students prep to grade 6. The school has around 100 students with over 20 prep students in 2019. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Alberton Football League. Fish Creek Football Netball Club (Kangaroos) is based at Terrill Park, the club rooms are one of the very few club rooms that are privately owned. The Fish Creek Football Netball Club (F.C.F.N.C) is over 100 years old and has had a few players who have gone on to play AFL. The town is home to the Big Mullet which lies on its side atop the Fish Creek Hotel.Famous fish to ‚Äòswim‚Äô again by Jacob De Kunder, The Great Southern Star, August 20, 2013: http://thestar.com.au/?p=8202 See also * Fish Creek railway station * Great Southern Rail Trail References Sources *Visit Victoria tourism website *Prom Country tourism website Gallery Image:Fish Creek Flying Cow Cafe Stevage.jpg Image:Fish Creek service station Stevage.jpg Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Fish Creek, Victoria"},{"id":"6659257","text":"Preah Vihear may refer to: * Preah Vihear Province, province of Cambodia * Preah Vihear (town), capital of Preah Vihear Province * Preah Vihear Temple, temple and namesake of the province ","title":"Preah Vihear"},{"id":"6659305","text":"Highest response ratio next (HRRN) scheduling is a non-preemptive discipline. It was developed by Brinch Hansen as modification of shortest job next (SJN) to mitigate the problem of process starvation. In HRRN, the next job is not that with the shortest estimated run time, but that with the highest response ratio defined as response\\\\ ratio = \\\\frac{waiting\\\\ time + estimated\\\\ run\\\\ time}{estimated\\\\ run\\\\ time} = 1 + \\\\frac{waiting\\\\ time}{estimated\\\\ run\\\\ time} This means, the jobs that have spent a long time waiting compete against those estimated to have short run times.  Algorithm  given a Linked list Q, iterate through Q to find the highest ratio by comparing each ratio within the queue. Once a ratio of element N is greater than the element M with the highest ratio replace element M with element N as the highest ratio element in the list. Once the end of the list is reached dequeue the highest ratio element. If the element is at the start of the list, dequeue it and set the list to its next element, returning the element. Otherwise N's neighbours are reassigned to identify each other as their next and previous neighbour, returning the result of N.

She is the property of the French private company Abeilles International. She is currently based at Toulon on the Mediterranean coast. She was previously based at Brest, where she assisted maritime traffic off the coast of Brittany. She was able to go to sea at 20 minutes' notice, and would also go to sea whenever winds in excess of were recorded at Ouessant. She was replaced on this station in April 2005 by the more powerful, 80-metre Abeille Bourbon. French rescue tugs on government contracts operate under the authority of a pr√©fet maritime. If a salvage is successful, the French state earns half the value of the salvaged cargo. When the vessel is not required for government service, its operator can request the pr√©fet to release it to perform private salvage and rescue missions. Rates for private salvages are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Fees are never charged to rescue people. Following her salvage role in the sinkings of the Erika and the Ievoli Sun, the Abeille Flandre gained recognition and public popularity in France. Herv√© Hamon's book L'Abeille d'Ouessant is a homage to the ship. The Abeille Flandre livery includes the angled blue-white-red stripes of a French ship in public service. She was featured in the Discovery Channel documentary Wild and Angry Seas, released in August 2003.

One of the early groups to coin this term was the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition at the University of Sydney in Australia, which for nearly fifty years (late 1960s to today) pioneered the research, teaching, and consulting of design and computational technologies. This group organised the academic conference series \\"Artificial Intelligence in Design (AID)\\" published by Springer during that period. AID was later renamed \\"Design Computing and Cognition (DCC)\\" and is currently a leading biannual conference in the field. Other notable groups in this area are the Design and Computationarchitecture.mit.edu/computation/program/overview group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's School of Architecture + Planning and the Computational Design group at Georgia Tech. Whilst these terms share in general an interest in computational technologies and design activity, there are important differences in the various approaches, theories, and applications. For example, while in some circles the term \\"computational design\\" refers in general to the creation of new computational tools and methods in the context of computational thinking, design computing is concerned with bridging these two fields in order to build an increased understanding of design. The Bachelor of Design Computing (BDesComp) was created in 2003 at the University of Sydney and continues to be a leading programme in interaction design and creative technologies, now hosted by the Design Lab. In that context, design computing is defined to be the use and development of computational models of design processes and digital media to assist and/or automate various aspects of the design process with the goal of producing higher quality and new design forms. Areas In recent years a number of research and education areas have been grouped under the umbrella term \\"Design Computing\\", namely: *Artificial Intelligence in Design *Artificial Architecture *Expert and Knowledge-based Systems *Computational creativity *Computer-Aided Design *Responsive computer-aided design *Digital morphogenesis *Visual and Spatial Modelling *Computational Analogy *Automated Design Systems *Design Support Systems *Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) *Building Information Modeling (BIM) *Extended Reality (XR) and Hybrid Space *Digital Place-making Research groups The main research groups working in this area span from Faculties of Architecture, Engineering and Computer Science. Australia has been a pioneer in this area. For the last five decades the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition (KCDC), currently known as the Design Lab, at the University of Sydney has been active in establishing this area of research and teaching. The University of Sydney offers a Bachelor of Design Computing () and the University of New South Wales also in Sydney a Bachelor of Computational Design (). In the US this research area is also known as \\"Design and Computation\\", namely at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

On the single, songwriting credit was given to founding member and saxophonist Roger Ball and guitarist Hamish Stuart individually and the entire band collectively. It is essentially an instrumental, apart from the song's title being shouted at several points in the song. Background The guitar line of the song came from Hamish Stuart, while Roger Ball wrote the first part of the horn melody. The song was produced by Arif Mardin. According to Malcolm 'Molly' Duncan, he had disagreed with releasing the song as a single because the song is a \\"funk instrumental played by Scotsmen with no lyrics other than a shout\\". He also said about the shouts of \\"Pick up the pieces\\": \\"It's about picking yourself up when things aren't going well. We'd spent a lot of time making no money whatsoever, so it felt very relevant.\\" The song is an extended long version on the live Person To Person album (1976) (18:06) and on the various artists album The Atlantic Family Live at Montreux (1977) (21:40). The tenor saxophone solo on the Montreux version is by noted jazz instrumentalist Michael Brecker. The solo on the original release is by Molly Duncan. The song is in the key of F minor. Chart performance \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\" was released in the United Kingdom in July 1974 but failed to chart. When the album was released in the United States in October 1974, radio stations there started to play the song, and on 22 February 1975, it went to the top of the US singles chart and peaked at number five on the soul charts. Billboard ranked it as the No. 20 song for 1975. In Canada, it reached number 4 on the weekly charts, and number 44 on the year-end chart. After its North American success, the song charted in the UK and climbed to number six. \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\" also made it to number eleven on the US disco chart. In popular culture After the song's success, The J.B.'s recorded an answer song, \\"Pick Up the Pieces One By One\\". The single was credited to \\"A.A.B.B.\\", or \\"Above Average Black Band\\". Reportedly, the primary motivation for the answer song was the appropriation of the bass line to James Brown's \\"Hot Pants Road\\". In Iron Man 2, Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell) danced with this song in the scene where he was going to be introduced at the expo. Singer and drummer Phil Collins covered that piece twice, first on his big band album A Hot Night in Paris, released in 1999. And second on his boxset 'Plays Well with Others, released in 2018. In 1994, Jeff Golub did a cover on the electric guitar featuring Rick Braun on the flugelhorn on his album called Avenue Blue. Avenue Blue was the band Jeff Golub was in from 1994-1998. In 2004, Kenny G did a cover on the tenor saxophone featuring David Sanborn on the alto saxophone on his album called At Last...The Duets Album.
