Its stated mission is to provide aid to senior citizens in communities while promoting a sense of community. There are over 200,000 volunteers nationwide. Senior Corps was formed when its constituent programs‚ÄîFoster Grandparents, Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), and Senior Companions‚Äîwere merged when the Corporation for National and Community Service was formed by then-president Bill Clinton in 1993. The three programs have unique histories, and each was developed to meet a specific need. The Foster Grandparent Program was piloted on August 28, 1965, to entice low income people over 60 in community service. The Senior Companion Program began as part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and Administration on Aging in 1968, and before being legislated and signed into law under President Richard Nixon. The Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) began as an outgrowth by private groups and government agencies to create opportunities of engagement, activity, and growth for older Americans following the work of the Community Service Society of New York on Staten Island beginning in 1965; the Society's success led the Older Americans Act being amended to create RSVP as a nationwide program in 1969.  History  Senior Corps was formed from a merge of its constituent programs: Foster Grandparents, Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), and Senior Companions. The three were originally mandated under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 with similar aims. The three programs have unique histories, and each was developed to meet a specific need, but all were crafted on the same belief that older adults are valuable resources to their communities. When the Corporation for National and Community Service was formed by then-president Bill Clinton in 1993, the three organizations were reformed into the single agency Senior Corps. The Foster Grandparent Program was piloted on August 28, 1965, to entice low income people over 60 in community service. The program quickly revealed the positive impact these thriving older Americans have on exceptional and special needs children and grew in scope. In the 1980s, the Foster Grandparent Program was championed by First Lady Nancy Reagan. She drew attention to the program and helped it grow as one of her pet projects. In 1968, the Senior Companion Program began as part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and Administration on Aging. Five years later, President Richard Nixon asked Congress to expand the role of low-income older volunteers who provide personal services to others. Seven months later, the Senior Companion Program was signed into law. RSVP began as an outgrowth by private groups and government agencies to create opportunities of engagement, activity, and growth for older Americans. One of the earliest programs, the Community Service Society of New York, began in 1965 on Staten Island. The project involved a small group of volunteers who were dedicated to serving their communities in a variety of ways. It was due to the success of their efforts that led to an amendment to the Older Americans Act, creating RSVP as a nationwide program in 1969.  Programs  Senior Corps is for people age 55+ who want to share their experiences with others who are most in need of mentors, coaches, or a companion. = Foster Grandparents = First operational on August 28, 1965, the Foster Grandparents program enables seniors to interact with and support young children, thus acting as foster grandparents. Open to seniors 55 and over, the program's goal is to provide \\"grandparents\\" who will give emotional support to victims of abuse and tutor, mentor, and care for children with disabilities. The participants make a difference in the lives of these children, receive pre- service and monthly training sessions, transportation reimbursement, an annual physical, and accident and liability insurance while working with the child/children. Some Foster Grandparents also receive small tax-free stipends to offset costs incurred while participating in the program; eligibility for these stipends is based on income criteria. = RSVP = Much like the Foster Grandparents program, the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) seeks to provide a way in which senior citizens can give back to their community. Flexible in nature, RSVP allows participants to choose how and when they work. Open to seniors 55 and over, the program's goals are wide and varied, and include job training, tutoring children, building homes, helping immunize children, relief services, and aid to community organizations. Volunteers are given a pre-service orientation, on-the-job training from the placement agency or organization, and supplemental insurance while on duty. This program does not provide a stipend. One of the more widespread RSVP programs is a telephone reassurance service; RSVP volunteers contact other seniors by phone to ensure their well-being and provide friendly chat. = Senior Companions = The Senior Companions program is aimed at helping citizens who need extra assistance to live independently, such as adults with disabilities or those with terminal illnesses and their caregivers. Participants provide both emotional and physical support by assisting with simple house chores, providing transportation, and offering companionship. A senior companion must be 55 years of age and able to give between 5 and 40 hours of service per week. In addition to making a significant contribution to the lives of others, a participant also receives pre-service and monthly training, transportation reimbursement, an annual physical, and meals and accident and liability insurance while on duty. Income-eligible Senior Companions also receive a modest, tax-free stipend to offset the cost of volunteering.

A roadway can be a line source of air and noise pollution and need not be a straight line. A line source, as opposed to a point source, area source, or volume source, is a source of air, noise, water contamination or electromagnetic radiation that emanates from a linear (one-dimensional) geometry. The most prominent linear sources are roadway air pollution, aircraft air emissions, roadway noise, certain types of water pollution sources that emanate over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point, elongated light tubes, certain dose models in medical physics and electromagnetic antennas. While point sources of pollution were studied since the late nineteenth century, linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late 1960s, when environmental regulations for highways and airports began to emerge. At the same time, computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing needs of the computer models required to tackle these one-dimensional sources became more available. In addition, this era of the 1960s saw the first emergence of environmental scientists who spanned the disciplines required to accomplish these studies. For example, meteorologists, chemists, and computer scientists in the air pollution field were required to build complex models to address roadway air dispersion modeling. Prior to the 1960s, these specialities tended to work within their own disciplines, but with the advent of NEPA, the Clean Air Act, the Noise Control Act in the United States, and other seminal legislation, the era of multidisciplinary environmental science had begun. For electromagnetic linear sources, the principal early advances in computer modeling arose in the Soviet Union and USA when the end of World War II and the Cold War were fought partially by progress in electronic warfare, including the technologies of active antenna arrays. Linear air pollution source Air pollution levels near major highways and urban arterials are in violation of U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards where millions of Americans live or work. Even the interior of a building does not really protect inhabitants from adverse exterior air quality, since the exterior air is the intake supply, and it is well known that indoor air quality is typically worse than exterior air. A roadway travelled by motor vehicles can be idealized by a line source emitting air pollutants. This mathematical problem was first solved in 1970 by a collaboration of physics, mathematics and computer science.Michael Hogan, Theoretical basis for atmospheric diffusion from a linear source, ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory, Publication IR-29, Sunnyvale, Ca., May 4, 1970Richard J. Venti, Atmospheric diffusion models for roadway sources, ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory, Publication ET-22, Sunnyvale, Ca., October 5, 1970. The original theory assumed steady-state traffic conditions and meteorology on a perfectly straight roadway. Currently the models have evolved to treat variable meteorology, time-variant traffic operations and complex roadbed geometries. Current technology allows highway designers and city planners to analyze alternative roadway development plans and assess air quality impacts. The same basic model theory can be applied to airport operations, since the linear source is merely an inclined line. In the early 1970s these ESL models were refined into area source models to account for the finite width of the roadway. Linear noise source The New Jersey Turnpike was one of the earliest line sources analyzed for noise Roadway noise is the most important example of a linear noise source, since it comprises about 80 percent of the environmental noise exposure for humans worldwide. In the 1960s, when computer modeling of this phenomenon was perfected, the first applications of linear source noise modeling became systematic. After passage of the National Environmental Policy Act and Noise Control Act,Public Law No. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234 (1972) Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, codification amended at 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918 (1988) the demand for detailed analysis soared, and decision makers began to look to acoustical scientists for answers regarding the planning of new roadways and the design of noise mitigation. The intensity of roadway noise is governed by the following variables: traffic operations (speed, truck mix, age of vehicle fleet), roadway surface type, tire types, roadway geometrics, terrain, micrometeorology and the geometry of area structures. Due to the complexity of the variables, a line source acoustic model must be a computer model that can analyze sound levels in the vicinity of roadways. The first meaningful models arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Two of the leading research teams were BBN in Boston and ESL Inc. of Sunnyvale, California. Both of these groups developed complex mathematical models to allow the study of alternate roadway designs, traffic operations and noise mitigation strategies in an arbitrary setting.John Shadely, Acoustical analysis of the New Jersey Turnpike widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick, Bolt Beranek and Newman, 1973 Later model alterations have come into widespread use among state Departments of Transportation and city planners, but the accuracy of early models has had little change in 40 years. Generally line source acoustic models trace sound ray bundles and calculate spreading loss along with ray bundle divergence (or convergence} from refractive phenomena. Diffraction is usually addressed by establishing secondary emitters at any points of topographic or anthropomorphic ‚Äúsharpness‚Äù (such as noise barriers or building surfaces. Meteorology can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual wind rose and wind speed statistics (along with thermocline data). Water pollution line source Colorado River, receiving effectively a linear source of silt from the sides of the Grand Canyon. Less common are line source applications in the field of water pollutant dispersal. This phenomenon generally arises when surface runoff scours soil contaminants from upper soil layers and transports these pollutants to a linear receiving water, such as a river. The underlying land management practices which lead to such sources of water pollution are logging, pesticide application, construction grading, slash-and-burn activity and urban stormwater runoff. Again computer models are needed to address the complexity of such an extended linear discharge into a dynamic medium such as flowing water. The resulting surface runoff water carrying pollutants may be considered a line source discharging into a river or stream. The chemical composition of this surface runoff may be characterized by a surface runoff model such as the USGS runoff precipitation algorithm,United States Geological Survey runoff precipitation algorithm while the instream transport may be analyzed by a dynamic river pollutant model such as DSSAM. Light emission line source Common T8 fluorescent lighting tubes used in office environments In the study of illumination, a variety of sources are linear in nature, most commonly the fluorescent tube, During the process of interior lighting design it is important to calculate the light intensity at work stations or other user areas, not only to ensure sufficient light is present, but more importantly to avoid over-illumination and its attendant energy wastage as well as adverse health effects. Thus the scientists involved in light transmission calculations employ computer models that recognize linear sources when fluorescent fixtures are used. In a typical setting there may be hundreds of finite length light sources that comprise the light output in an office environment. A related concept are the ultraviolet tubes used in phototherapy, where output radiation from the tube can be accurately modeled by treating the tube as a line source.David Robert Grimes, Chris Robbins, Neil John O'Hare. Dose Modeling in Ultraviolet phototherapy, Medical Physics, 37(10) October 2010 On a larger scale, an illuminated roadway may act as a line source of light pollution.

It is currently the largest satellite of the Hermitage Museum, with a total area of and fits with the museum's plan to make its collections accessible to more people. The exhibition area covers and is contained within two large exhibition halls and smaller exhibition rooms. The remaining space holds lecture halls, offices and staff accommodations and a restaurant. History A 1693 etching of the Amstelhof, showing the building out of proportions. The structure opened in 1682 as a retirement home for elderly women under the name Diaconie Oude Vrouwen Huys () on the east bank of the river Amstel. Beginning in 1817, the facility housed both elderly men and women, and was renamed Diaconie Oude Vrouwen- en Mannenhuis (English: Deanery Home for Old Men and Women). The building was first named Amstelhof () in 1953. In the 1990s, operators of the facility determined that it was inadequate to meet the modern needs of its residents and sought to build a new structure elsewhere. They offered the historic structure to the city of Amsterdam, who, in turn, leased it to the museum. The last inhabitants left the Amstelhof in 2007. On 20 June 2009, the museum was opened by Dutch Queen Beatrix and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The museum was open to the public the following day. During the more than 300 years that residents were housed in the Amstelhof, several renovations took place on the building interior and wings were added to provide needed space. Thus, little of the original interior remained when work for the museum began. While some areas were restored to their original appearance, many existing walls were removed and spaces reconfigured to accommodate the museum's needs. The total cost of the renovations was 40 million. The temporary museum in the Neerlandia Building on the Nieuwe Keizersgracht closed in 2008 to become the Hermitage for Children. It opened along with the main museum on 20 June 2009. Exhibitions Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Queen Beatrix at the official opening of Hermitage Amsterdam on 20 June 2009.

Alexander the Great (356 BC ‚Äì 323 BC, king from 336 BC) appeals to the imagination more than any ruler of the ancient age. Beginning in his youth he inspired those around him. During his campaigns in the East, Alexander searched for the origins of Dionysus, whom the ancient Greeks believed came from the exotic East, possibly India. He followed in the footsteps of Dionysus to reach countries such as Bactria, Egypt, India, Mongolia, Persia and Syria. Everywhere he went he established cities, naming many Alexandria, and left behind a legacy of Greek culture in the form of Hellenism. Alexander's fame lived long after antiquity as an example to many European, Russian and Islamic rulers. His life and history were depicted through paintings, tapestries and decorative art from classical antiquity to the modern age, of Western and non- Western origins. =Matisse to Malevich= Eddy Roos in the garden of Hermitage Amsterdam * Matisse to Malevich. Pioneers of Modern Art from the Hermitage 6 March to 17 September 2010 The exhibit was the first display in The Netherlands of works from the Hermitage Museum's collections of French paintings of the late 19th and early 20th century. The collection was started by Russian collectors Morozov and Shchukin. The exhibit contained hundreds of masterpieces by artists who pioneered Modernism, including Matisse, Van Dongen, De Vlaminck, Derain and Picasso. It looked at the concept of Modernism from a historical perspective and examined how artists joined the new movement.

The district is the tenth largest urban school district in the State of Ohio. History Lorain city schools dates far back as to 1875. The first Lorain high school is established in 1875. The high school began as a two-year high school course. In 1879, the first graduating class consisted of three members. By 1878 there were 68 students enrolled in Lorain's two schools. Quickly the school district grew to have 6 school buildings, and 2,600 children enrolled in Lorain City Schools by 1903. By 1972 there were 17,508 students enrolled in the public school system. In 1995, the then Lorain High School (Located on Washington Avenue and 6th Street) was closed and became Lorain Middle School. At this point the school district had two high schools Southview and Admiral King High School. Lorain City Schools went through a revitalization project starting in the 2000s. This revitalization project was funded through a bond issue voted on by the city in 2001. which resulted in first the rebuilding of several elementary schools and middle schools. The revitalization project resulted in buildings being torn down and rebuilt nearby where the old buildings stood. Today, many of the new buildings carry the same name. Lorain middle school remained opened until 2005 when new middle schools were established. In 2005 Washington, Larkmoor, Palm and Garfield Elementary open as new school buildings, as well as General Johnnie Wilson and Longfellow Middle Schools. Annexes and temporary locations were used during rebuilding of locations. The plan also called for the eventual opening of one new high school which would re carry the name Lorain High School. The Lorain High School project reunited the two existing high schools which were decreasing in population and in also need of updating. In the fall of 2010, following the merger of Lorain Admiral King High School and Lorain Southview High School, Lorain High School reopened as the Lorain High School Titans. The former Lorain Middle school and original Lorain High was demolished in the summer of 2010. The development plan called for the New Lorain High School to open in the fall of 2016. Since 2010 Lorain High School was housed in the former Lorain Admiral King High School building. Beginning in the fall of 2012, Lorain High School was rehoused in the former Lorain Southview High School and Southview Middle School to make way for the development of the new high schools.

Sports teams competed in the Buckeye Conference and Erie Shore Conference. =Lorain Admiral King High School= Lorain Admiral King High School crest. Formerly the largest high school in the Lorain City School District, Admiral King High School opened in 1961. Admiral King High School was named for Lorain native Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King a former Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet. The school was renamed Lorain Admiral King High School when it was merged with Lorain High School in 1995. The school's colors were navy blue and gold, the mascot was the ram, and the sports teams were known as the Admirals. The school was previously a member of the Buckeye Conference, the Erie Shore Conference, and the Lake Erie League. The tunes to the school's alma mater and fight song were \\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save\\" and \\"Anchors Aweigh\\", respectively. =Lorain Southview High School= Southview High School was completed in 1969. Its school colors were red, white and originally baby blue (which was later changed to navy). The sports teams were known as the Saints, and played in the Buckeye and Erie Shore Conferences. The mascot was a young boy dressed as an angel with a black eye and a patch on his elbow. The school's fight song was \\"When the Saints Go Marching In.\\" The school was previously a member of the Lake Erie League. Their Model UN, Army JROTC, wrestling team, and marching band have been given many honors. During the short lived small school years, the small schools were called: Leadership, Pride and Arts. The school board decided to close Southview High School at the end of the 2009-2010 school year and merge the Saints with the Admirals from Lorain Admiral King High School. Starting for the 2012 school year, Southview High School will be the temporary home of Lorain High School. Once the new high school is erected on the site of the former Admiral King High School, all students will then transfer there.

It is the 12th oldest school in the country. Other than its rich history, the school is known for all-round excellence in sport, culture, academics and the performance of notable old boys across a wide sphere of society. The pillar values of the school are pride, respect and gentlemanship along with humility, excellence, integrity and responsibility (PRG HEIR). Another notable characteristic of the school is its gees (Afrikaans for spirit) and their famous fight song \\"Old boys of Paul Roos\\" which is the melody of Flower of Scotland in remembrance of the first three Scottish rectors, which they sing with their old boys. Paul Roos Gymnasium has produced more Springbok rugby players than any other school (54). It is also the school with the most players in the 2019 Rugby World Cup including 5 Springboks namely Schalk Brits, Willie le Roux, Steven Kitshoff, Herschel Jantjies, Damian Willemse and Braam Steyn who played for Italy. In 1910 the school was renamed Stellenbosch Boys' High School and old boy Paul Roos became the sixth rector of the school where he served for thirty years. In 1946 the school moved to the new buildings in Krigeville and was renamed Paul Roos Gymnasium after Paul Roos, old boy and captain of the first Springbok team, was himself a teacher at the school, and was the school's rector from 1910 to 1940, after which the school was renamed in his honour. Associations and facilities Though Paul Roos Gymnasium is a school for boys from grade 8 to 12, the curriculum includes some subjects presented in conjunction with the two sister schools, Ho√´r Meisieskool Bloemhof and Rhenish. The school is dual medium; Afrikaans- and English-speaking pupils study under one roof, but classes are largely separated according to mother tongue. The school shares sport and internet facilities with Stellenbosch University. School facilities include a library and computer labs. Sports facilities include hockey fields, the Mark√∂tter rugby fields, a swimming pool, an Olympic Waterpolo Aquatic Centre, tennis courts, and a gymnasium. The main residential facilities are the two school hostels (dormitories) called Prima and Prima Nova. They accommodate 245 boarders, mainly from South Africa and Namibia. Notable attainments Paul Roos was classified as a 'prestige' school, being among the best-performing schools.Marking Matric: Colloquium Proceedings, Vijay Reddy, 2006. HSRC Press. In 2018 the University of Stellenbosch, which evolved out of this school, celebrated its centenary. In the first 100 years of its existence, 26 old boys received honorary doctorates from this university more than any other school in the country.

This API can be optionally supported by mobile phone and PDA manufacturers, with the minimum Java platform required for this API being CLDC v1.1. The Location API was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 179, released in September 2003 and updated to version 1.0.1 in March 2006. Nokia is the main author and maintainer of this JSR. OpenLAPI is an LGPL implementation for use in emulator environments where the Nokia reference implementation does not exist and for devices which can access a GPS device over Bluetooth.  Features  The Location API is designed to work with many different positioning methods. Generic interfaces lets application developers implement systems that can retrieve location data from multiple sources, based on their availability on the device. It has advantages over a single means of tracking, including fail-over, indoor/outdoor transparency, and a choice between the speed and accuracy trade-offs between GPS, cellular, or other positioning methods. The API supports:Dr. Dobb's 2006 - The Java Location API *Current location - current latitude, longitude, altitude, direction, and speed of the phone, and methods to convert it to text. *Landmark proximity - a store of landmarks can be stored on the phone's memory, and the current location can be added as a landmark. *Address data - the nearest landmark's textual details, such as postal address, phone number, country, and the building and its URL.Dr. Dobb's 2006 - The Java Location API - Address Information *Location listeners - for dynamic location-based applications that will be triggered by when the current location changes. The Location API does not support: *Topological data - which is usually derived from the shapes of cell site coverage. *Location-based queries - although the current location of the device can be calculated.  Device independence  Previously, location service implementations were provider specific. The aim of this API was to provide a common API for retrieving the location information on a variety of devices. OpenLAPI supports several back-ends: * GPS over Bluetooth * NMEA logfile (for development) * KML (Keyhole Markup Language) (for development) * random entry from a persistent landmark store (for development) along with device specific wrappers.  Support  Since many providers choose not to implement this optional JSR, the goal of universality has still not happened and developers are often required to create custom builds for different devices. The Location API is available to Java applications on some BlackBerry and Windows Mobile devices, recent Motorola and Sony Ericsson devices, and all Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition devices.

Air pollution For example, area sources of air pollution are air pollutant emission sources which operate within a certain locale. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has categorized 70 different categories of air pollution area source.Arnold W. Reitze, J. B. Shapiro and Maurice C. Shapiro. 2005 Locomotives operating on certain linear tracks are examples of a line source, whereas locomotives operating within a railyard are an example of an area source of pollution. Other area sources of air pollution are: * Multiple flue gas stacks within a single industrial plant * Open burning and forest fires * Evaporation losses from large spills of volatile liquids Water pollution Water pollution manifestations of an area source‚Äîoften called nonpoint source pollution‚Äîinclude: * Surface runoff of fertilizer or pesticides from rainfall or irrigation water * Widespread failure of a septic drain field * Dispersal of an oil spill in a water body. In the 1950s or earlier hydrology transport models appeared to calculate surface runoff, primarily for flood forecasting. Beginning in the early 1970s computer models were developed to analyze the transport of runoff carrying water pollutants, which considered dissolution rates of various chemicals, infiltration into soils and ultimate pollutant load delivered to receiving waters. One of the earliest models addressing chemical dissolution in runoff and resulting transport was developed in the early 1970s by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.C. Michael Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. 1973 This computer model formed the basis of much of the regulatory framework that led to strategies for water pollution control via land use and chemical handling techniques.

Whoopi Goldberg was the host of the program. The show was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks out of New York City. The program was roughly one-third talk and two-thirds music (excluding commercials); the music was programmed by the individual stations in most cases. Discussion largely centered on water cooler topics as well as interviews with various guests, mostly from the entertainment industry. History The program signed on on July 31, 2006 on flagship station WKTU, launching into syndication two weeks later. Wake Up with Whoopi aired from 5am - 9am local time (live on the East Coast) in several markets. At its peak, the program was heard on four of the top six major markets (New York's WKTU, Chicago's WLIT, San Francisco's KKSF and Philadelphia's WISX) and approximately twenty affiliates overall.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media, Inc., through licensee Radio License Holding CBC LLC, and broadcasts an adult contemporary music format. The station's service contour covers the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. The station's antenna is located on the WFMZ-TV broadcast tower on South Mountain south of Allentown at (). History =100.7 frequency= 100.7 FM began operation in 1947 as WFMZ. On November 1, 1947, it moved from 105.1 MHz to 95.9 MHz concurrent with an increase in power to 1 KW. The station originally played classical music as well as jazz music at various times of the day. In the 1950s, the station began playing blocks of instrumental easy listening music as well. In 1965, the station was sold to a Christian local group called Maranatha Broadcasting. At that point, WFMZ flipped to a religious/easy listening format. For many hours a day, the station sold blocks of time to churches. The rest of the day was filled with only instrumental easy listening music known as \\"Beautiful Music\\". The station initially played no vocalists. In the 1970s, WFMZ began cutting back the religious programming to very early mornings and middays and late evenings. The station began to focus more on the easy listening music. By the mid 1970s, the station added some soft vocals by standard and adult contemporary artists; they began playing one or two per hour. In 1976, Maranatha signed on as television station Channel 69. That station became known as WFMZ-TV, as the FM station was now WFMZ FM. The television station ran mostly religious shows along with about 6 hours a day of classic sitcoms and drama shows. In the 1980s, WFMZ FM continued with the beautiful music format cutting the religious shows down to a couple hours a day at most. A boost in the ratings occurred when WQQQ dropped easy listening for Top 40 in 1983. WFMZ FM began gradually mixing in more vocalists and began playing about four an hour by 1987. By 1990, they were about half vocal and half instrumental. In 1991, the station overhauled the format and dropped most of the standards artists and focused on soft hits from popular AC and CHR artists. The station was now mostly vocal with an instrumental each hour. By 1994, WFMZ evolved completely into a Soft Adult Contemporary format. Maranatha put WFMZ FM up for sale in 1996. Citadel Broadcasting bought them late that year. They already owned AC station WLEV on 96.1. The rumor was they would flip WFMZ FM to country. Upon closing though, both stations remained AC outlets with WFMZ being softer. In the summer of 1997, it was determined that Allentown only needed one adult contemporary station. A country station was also needed. So, in July 1997, 96.1 WLEV became a country music station. The call letters were changed to WCTO and they became \\"Cat Country 96\\". Half of the WLEV 96.1 airstaff remained on 96.1 and many new airstaffers were hired to carry out the country format. 100.7 FM had only a couple of air staffers and was mostly automated. The staffers who did not stay on 96.1 moved to fill daytime hours on 100.7. The WLEV call letters also moved to 100.7. The intellectual properties of 96.1 WLEV and 100.7 WFMZ FM were combined onto 100.7. The format overall became a straight Adult contemporary format. The religious shows were taken off. Delilah's love songs' show was added in the 7 p.m. to midnight time slot. Citadel's 1400 WEST was sold to Maranatha Broadcasting. =WLEV intellectual unit= WLEV began in 1947 as WEST-FM on 96.1. For decades the station simulcast WEST's Middle Of The Road Popular Music format. In 1973, though, 96.1 became WLEV and began offering a Soft Rock/Adult Contemporary format that was very automated. They played the softer rock hits of the 1960s and 1970s along with a lot of current product. They were known as \\"Hit Parade Music\\" at one point. The station was owned by Sound Media and then by Telemedia Group. Through the 1970s and into the 1980s, WLEV 96.1 continued as a straight-ahead adult contemporary station with no dramatic changes. More personalities were added in the late 1980s, and by the 1990s, the station bordered on being a Hot AC. But the texture of the station was consistent. In 1995, the station was sold, along with WEST, to Citadel Broadcasting. Still, the format remained Adult Contemporary. In 1997, Citadel acquired WFMZ FM, which by then had a format that was evolving to be musically closer to WLEV. In 1997, it was decided that there was no need for two AC stations, so they combined aspects of the AC formats from both stations and moved the WLEV calls, format, and some of the airstaff to 100.7 that July. 96.1 became Cat Country WCTO playing a Country format. As a country music station, the station achieves some very high ratings. The station has a live airstaff almost full-time. The station focuses on Country hits of the 1980s, 1990s and current product. WLEV competes today with WBEB and WODE-FM as adult listening radio stations. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

The terms \\"legislation\\" and \\"law\\" are used to refer generically to statutes, regulation and other legal instruments (e.g. ministerial decrees) that may be the forms of law used in a particular country.Medical Malpractice Lawyers In general, there are a wide range of regulatory strategies that may be used to ensure people's health and safety. Increasingly, regulators are taking an approach of \\"responsive regulation\\". This involves using mechanisms that are responsive to the context, conduct, and culture of those being regulated, providing for a range of regulatory mechanisms to achieve the behavior desired. Where appropriate, the aim is to use incentives before sanctions. However, when those being regulated do not respond accordingly, escalating sanctions can be invoked. These strategies may be broadly classified into five groups: #voluntarism: voluntary compliance undertaken by an individual organization without any coercion; #self-regulation: for example, an unorganized group that regulates the behavior of its members through a voluntary code of practice; #economic instruments: for example, supply funding sanctions or incentives for health care providers, and/or demand-side measures that give more power to consumers; #meta-regulation: involving an external regulatory body to ensure that health care providers implement safety and quality practices and programs; #command and control mechanisms: involving enforcement by government Legal practice Areas of law that may fall under the umbrella of health law include: * Contract law * Medical malpractice * Medical law * Administrative law * Public health law * Consent In the U.S., medicine and the law are interconnected. The law intervenes to regulate the duty to treat, that essentially is ruled by contract law, which gives a doctor the right to refuse treatment, in the absence of an emergency, when no previous doctor-patient relationship existed. However Doctors cannot discriminate because of disability, ADA, abandon a patient, or not render services in an emergency according to EMTALA (it aims doctors in emergency rooms, where they need to screen, stabilize and transfer. It also regulates the fiduciary duties of doctor-patient, such as privacy HIPAA, informed consent (battery unlawful touch), conflict of interests, (Moore case), etc. =Board certification= Health Law was first adopted as a separate legal specialty in which attorneys could become \\"board-certified\\" and in which they could hold themselves out as a \\"legal specialist\\" or \\"legal expert\\" by The Florida Bar's Board of Legal Specialization in 1995. Later Texas adopted a similar program in 2002 modeling its program after Florida's. =Education= One way in which an attorney in the United States can obtain additional education to practice health law or to use in becoming certified in the specialty of health law is through one of the Master of Laws (LL.M.) programs that are offered by certain law schools. The LL.M. is considered to be a postgraduate law degree which shows a higher level of course work and study above the basic law degree (J.D. or B.S.L.). Some law schools with graduate law programs do offer a general LL.M. with course emphasis on health law, global health law, public health law, forensic medicine or similar studies. =Malpractice= Medical malpractice is also an area where law and medicine are interconnected, which relates to the standard of care, where custom similar locality rule may apply. There may be different schools of thought, where reputability is the issue at hand and alternative theories that can be based on the hand formula. There are other aspects of importance within the area of medical malpractice, such as causation, where medical probability and loss of chance are present. Damages, where the value of life and tort reforms appear to differ, and affirmative defenses, within the doctrine of informed consent, where waivers cannot suffice. There are rules such as the discovery rule that states that the statute of limitations starts to run when the injury has been discovered and not when it took place.

Registered charity number 1161203.\\"Radio Harrow listing on the Charity Commission\\", Charity Commission for England and Wales Charitable Objectives The charity launched in April 2015 after two local broadcasters; Radio Northwick Park and Harrow Community Radio came together. The two organisations had previously worked in partnership over a number of years in the lead up to the creation of Radio Harrow, sharing broadcasts, volunteers, as well as Trustees and Directors. Now combined, the new organisation has 150 volunteers, two state of the art studios, a production area, equipment to enable it to broadcast via the Internet and FM waveband and the ability to produce outside broadcasts from anywhere within the London Boroughs of Brent, Harrow and Ealing. The radio station engages with the general public by broadcasting a mix of local and regional information, which relates to the health and wellbeing of the local community and helps people shape their local area. It also provides a voice for local residents and organisation groups to make a positive difference to the community they serve and help make it a friendly and enjoyable place to live. The objectives of the charity are:\\"Radio Harrow About Page\\" * The relief of sickness, poor health and old age amongst people living in the London Boroughs of Brent, Harrow and Ealing by providing a local broadcasting service for hospitals, residential homes and similar institutions, and for patients receiving community care; and * The advancement of health and prevention or relief of sickness for the public benefit through the promotion of the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle, and the importance of maintaining good personal mental and physical health by (mainly, but not exclusively) the means of broadcasting health education messages to people living in the London Boroughs of Brent, Harrow and Ealing. As well as the new charitable objectives, there are several areas the charity focuses on, which centre around health and wellbeing within the community. These are: * Broadcasting * A Befriending Service * Education * Social Integration, and; * Becoming the Voice for Harrow The befriending service is provided to the London North West Healthcare NHS Trust. Currently concentrating on Northwick Park Hospital, the service is set to grow to the other hospitals the Trust covers, Ealing and Central Middlesex. The radio station is a member of the Hospital Broadcasting Association and Community Media Association. History Radio Harrow is the coming together of two organisations in Harrow. Radio Northwick Park and Harrow Community Radio. Radio Northwick Park (known as RNP) was a Hospital Radio charity run by volunteers to provide patient visiting and a broadcast entertainment service to the North West London Hospitals NHS Trust. In the 44 years of its existence it grew in strength and became one of the first hospital radio stations in the UK to broadcast 24 hours a day and online. The volunteers visited over 15,000 patients a year to help make their stay in hospital as comfortable and enjoyable as it can be and then broadcast back personalised shows in the form of a daily request show, alongside their regular broadcasting, aimed at entertaining the patients. RNP was founded by a group of volunteers from the Jewish Youth Voluntary Service, who set up a hospital radio service at Harrow Hospital on Roxeth Hill. With no room for a permanent studio, programmes were only broadcast on Sundays and volunteers installed and dismantled the equipment weekly. In 1971 a permanent studio was built in the basement of the new Northwick Park Hospital and RNP went on air in April 1971. During their existence they regularly became the radio of choice for patients to listen to, beating rivals such as BBC Radio and London commercial stations. Harrow Community Radio (known as HCR) was a not for profit Community radio in the United Kingdom setup in 2010 to engage with those who live and work in the local community. It acted as a platform for the community to have a voice, which may not otherwise have been heard. In the five years of its existence it created firm ties with the local authority, businesses, community, charity groups and educational institutions, to become the go to people to host community events and summer schemes. It ran a full 28-day Restricted Service Licence, broadcasting over FM and not just via the Internet.

Early career Born in Westminster, Coventry was educated at Eton and Oxford, Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1970. although he did not gain a blue at university. He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire in August 1919 against HK Foster's XI, taking the wickets of Sidney Freeman and Howard Battersea but being dismissed for nought in his only innings. The following season Worcestershire rejoined the County Championship and Coventry played three matches, all in August, taking six wickets -- the most he was to achieve in a single season -- including the wickets of both Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe in the same innings of the match against Yorkshire. For the next two seasons Coventry played little first-class cricket -- though in 1922 he made his highest score, 86 against Derbyshire -- but in 1923 he made 18 appearances, scoring 544 runs and making two more half-centuries. A poor 1924 followed, in which he managed just 220 runs in 11 innings, Captaincy and later career In July 1929, Coventry returned to the Worcestershire side as captain, replacing Maurice Jewell who had resigned as a result of poor health. He scored 412 runs and hit two fifties that season, while in August he took his first wicket for six years when he had Leicestershire's George Geary caught by Peter Jackson. Coventry remained as captain for the following season, despite playing in only eight games, but in 1931 he was himself replaced by Cyril Walters. After that, Coventry played only four more first-class games, with no more half-centuries and only one more wicket, which was to prove his last, although the victim was another big name in Bob Wyatt. His final appearance came, after a two-year gap, in June 1935 against Leicestershire; he bowed out quietly with 4 and 11 not out and did not bowl, though he did hold a catch to dismiss Alan Shipman off the bowling of Reg Perks. Outside cricket Coventry was a partner in Tattersalls, and served as Mayor of Worcester in 1929 and 1930. However, his entry in thePeerage.com suggests he was Alderman, not Mayor, in the latter year. In the Second World War, he was in the Grenadier Guards. He stood as a Conservative in Carmarthen in 1929, but was unsuccessful. Cricketing relations His uncle Charles Coventry played two Test matches for England in 1888-89, and also played for Worcestershire before their elevation to first- class status. Another uncle, Henry Coventry, played two first-class games for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1888. His grandfather, the 9th Earl of Coventry, played for teams including MCC and Worcestershire, but never appeared at first-class level.

The coalition seeks to ensure the dignity, safety and legal equality of all Kansans. Created on October 9, 2005, during a meeting in Emporia, Kansas, KEC is dedicated to ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Chapters The Equality Coalition started with five original chapters: * Johnson County (since reorganized as the Northeast Kansas Chapter) * Lawrence/Douglas County * Topeka * The Flint Hills (since reorganized as the Riley/Geary County Chapter) * Wichita Since then, the following chapters have been added: * Southwest Kansas (March 14, 2006) * North Central (July 26, 2006) * South East (January 13, 2008) * Central Plains (April 27, 2008) * Hutchinson Area (June 27, 2010) * Northwest Kansas (July 18, 2010) Activities KEC-Lawrence members were instrumental in persuading the city of Lawrence, Kansas, to institute a domestic partnership registry in 2007. It is the first of its kind in the state. Lawrence is the seat of Douglas County, which is the only county in Kansas where a majority of voters opposed the state's 2005 constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In February 2007, members of the Kansas Equality Coalition testified before the Kansas House Committee on Federal and State affairs in opposition to a bill that would have outlawed domestic partnership registries in the state.Committee Minutes, February 15, 2007 No floor vote on the bill was held in 2007. In February 2008, the Kansas House of Representatives voted 66 to 50 to refer the bill to the House Judiciary Committee for more hearings. In August 2007, members of the coalition stood with then Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius as she signed an executive order banning discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The order applies to the executive branch of state government. In March 2009, Members of the coalition's Topeka chapter were instrumental in successfully lobbying the Board of the Topeka/Shawnee Co. Library to prevent a move by local religious conservatives to restrict access and censor predominately LGBT sexual education materials. Kansas Equality PAC In 2006 the coalition formed a political action committee, Kansas Equality PAC, to work toward the election of state and local candidates for office in Kansas who support equality for LGBT Kansans.

Canadian blues singer/guitarist David Gogo in 2011. Canadian blues is the blues and blues-related music (e.g., blues rock) performed by blues bands and performers in Canada. Canadian blues artists include singers, players of the main blues instruments: guitar (acoustic and electric), harmonica (\\"blues harp\\"), keyboards (piano and Hammond organ), bass and drums, songwriters and music producers. In many cases, blues artists take on multiple roles. For example, the Canadian blues artist Steve Marriner is a singer, harmonica player, guitarist, songwriter and record producer. Due to Canada's long shared border with the birthplace of the blues, the United States, there has always been collaboration and contact between Canadian blues artists and their US counterparts. Top Canadian blues artists perform at major US blues bars and festivals and travel to the US to play and record with influential US blues artists. Similarly, US blues bands routinely play in Canadian clubs and blues festivals, and perform and record with Canadian blues artists. For example, Canadian blues guitarist/singer JW-Jones has invited the US bluesman Kim Wilson (lead singer for The Fabulous Thunderbirds) to Canada to play with JW Jones' band and so that Wilson could record with Jones and act as record producer on one of Jones' mid-2000s albums. There are hundreds of local and regionally based Canadian blues bands and performers which perform mainly in small venues in their home city or town. A much smaller number of Canadian bands and performers have achieved national or international prominence, due to the sales performance of their recordings, acclaim from blues music reviewers and performances at major festivals in Canada, the US, and Europe.Encyclopedia of Canadian rock, pop and folk music by Rick Jackson, (Kingston, ON: Quarry Press, 1994). ()The Penguin Book of Canadian Folk Songs by Edith Fowke. Markham, ON: Penguin, 1986. () These notable bands and performers are supported by a broader Canadian \\"blues scene\\" that also includes city or regional blues societies, blues radio shows, blues festivals, blues clubs and informal blues \\"jam sessions\\". Origins Due to Canada's proximity to the United States (there is a huge shared border), and to the fact that most of the Canadian population lives close to the border, many US blues artists have played in Canadian towns and cities. As well, many Canadian musicians and bands have been able to play in US towns, particularly Canadians who live near US cities close to the border, such as Detroit and Chicago. These two elements have given Canadian blues musicians a substantial opportunity to be directly influenced by US artists. Canadian blues is based on the major US blues styles, such as Chicago Blues and Mississippi Blues. The proximity of the two countries also facilitates collaborative projects featuring artists from both countries. For example, the Canadian bluesman JW- Jones had his third album, My Kind Of Evil (2004), produced by the US artist Kim Wilson (singer and harmonica player for The Fabulous Thunderbirds), and subsequent albums included collaborations with US saxophonist David \\"Fathead\\" Newman and US blues artists such as Little Charlie Baty, Junior Watson, Richard Innes, and Larry Taylor. Canadian harp player and band leader David Rotundo has visited many of the key US blues regions, which greatly influenced his musical development. Nationally or internationally-prominent artists A small number of Canadian blues bands and artists have achieved national or international prominence by touring across Canada, the US, or Europe, and releasing recordings that have received critical or audience acclaim in Canada and abroad. The performers below are listed according to the decade during which they first achieved national or international prominence. =1950s-1970s= Ronnie Hawkins In late 1950s, US-born rockabilly pioneer Ronnie Hawkins (born 1935) came to Canada, where he became a key player in the 1960s rock and blues scene in Toronto. 4 October 2002 was declared \\"Ronnie Hawkins Day\\" by the city of Toronto when Hawkins was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame, and he was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame at the Canadian Music Industry Awards in 2004. His pioneering contribution to rockabilly has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. His 1984 LP, 'Making It Again', earned him a Juno Award for Country Male Vocalist. \\"King Biscuit Boy\\" Richard Newell (1944‚Äì2003), who performed under the nickname \\"King Biscuit Boy\\", was a vocalist, arranger, songwriter, slide guitarist, and harmonica player. He released his first solo recording, \\"Official Music\\", in 1970, and it charted on the US Billboard album charts. A native of Hamilton, Ontario, he had learned his craft playing in blues rock bands and backing up Ronnie Hawkins, who gave him his nickname. In 1980, his release entitled \\"Mouth of Steel\\" appeared on the \\"Red Lightning\\" record label from England. In 1987, his recording \\"King Biscuit Boy AKA Richard Newell\\" was nominated for a Juno Award in the Best Roots and Traditional category. In the 1970s, the Downchild Blues Band was formed in Toronto by Donnie Walsh. The band has released fourteen albums and performed in thousands of venues over three decades of continual cross-Canada touring. The Downchild Blues Band still performs regularly. Another important Canadian bluesman who became notable during the 1970s was Norman \\"Dutch\\" Mason (born February 19, 1938 in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, died December 23, 2006 in Truro, Nova Scotia). Mason was a Canadian singer, guitarist, and pianist who was nicknamed the \\"Prime Minister of the Blues\\" in the 1970s for his prominent role in the Canadian blues scene. His albums included Dutch Mason Trio at the Candlelight from 1971 (Paragon ALS-263) and Janitor of the Blues from 1977 (Solar SAR-2020). In 1991 he released I'm Back (Stony Plain SPCD-1169). He was inducted into the Canadian Jazz and Blues Hall of Fame, and in 2005, he became a Member of the Order of Canada. That same year, son Garrett Mason won a Juno Award for Best Blues album. =1980s-1990s= Tom Lavin, leader of the Powder Blues band. In 1980, the Powder Blues, led by Tom Lavin, had double platinum sales for their debut album 'Uncut', which also had four top ten songs. The band won a Juno for 'Best New Group'. The second album, Thirsty Ears, released on Capitol Records had platinum sales, and a top 5 single. In 1983, Powder Blues played at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands. In 1986, the band won the W.C.

January 2015. .Joub Jannine ( / ALA-LC: Jub Jannƒ´n) is located in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. Joub Jannine is the capital of West Beqaa. It is a town and the center of the Western Beqaa District, hosting the Serail, which is a main governmental building serving the area. Joub Jannine is the largest and most populated town in its district. All major banks exist in Joub Jannine as well as a trades college, Amusement Park, indoor/outdoor soccer arena, basketball court and the weekly Souk which takes place every Saturday and is a local produce market. Joub Jannine is surrounded by a number of villages. To the south there is the village of Lala, Ghazze to the north, Kamid al lawz to the east, and Kefraya, known for its wine grape vineyards, to the west. Archaeological sites Joub Jannine I is a small surface site brought to the surface through erosional activity of a stream. It is 8 km northeast of Qaraoun in a range of foothills, 1 km north of a small village called Jebel Gharbi, between two tracks, west of cote 878 by about 200 m. The site was found by Dubertret with a collection made by Henri Fleisch and Maurice Tallon that is now in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at the Saint Joseph University. Flint tools found on the site included bifaces and rough pieces that were suggested to date to the Acheulean.Besan√ßon, J. et Hours, F., Pr√©histoire et g√©omorphologie : les formes du relief et les d√©p√¥ts quaternaires dans la r√©gion de Joub Jannine (B√©qaa m√©ridionale, Liban). Hannon, Beyrouth, vol. V, p. 63-95, 1970 Joub Jannine II was first discovered by M. Billaux in 1957. It was described by Henri Fleisch as Neolithic in 1960.Fleisch, Henri., Les industries lithiques r√©centes de la B√©kaa, R√©publique Libanaise, Acts of the 6th C.I.S.E.A., vol. XI, no. 1. Paris, 1960. It is located on the right bank of the Litani River northwest of the village, 100 m from the river and 100 m east of cote 861. An abundant amount of flint was collected including nine hundred and forty four tools and one hundred and fifty two cores. This was first reported to be a paleolithic industry by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe. A highly specialized archaeological industry of striking spheroid and trihedral flint tools was found at the site and published by Fleisch in 1960, termed by Copeland and Wescombe as the Trihedral Neolithic. Little has been said about this industry or the ancient people that would have used these huge rock mauls (i.e. hammers) in this area, at the dawn of agriculture, or what they would have been using them for. The material from Joub Jannine II was described by Lorraine Copeland as Joub Jannine III (The Gardens) is a Heavy Neolithic site of the Qaraoun culture, south of the village along steep slopes and around the houses. It was discovered by Henri Fleisch and Maurice Tallon in 1957. An abundant amount of material was recovered, which included several large flakes and blades along with a finer series of rabots and scrapers that is now held in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at the Saint Joseph University. No large bifaces were found at this site. The site may extend through the areas now turned into gardens. It was covered in crops in 1966.  Tourism & Nightlife  = Tourism = Joub Jannine is not really known for tourism. However, it is home to one of the oldest bridges in Lebanon, called The Roman Bridge of Joub Jannine (built in 704 AD). Sadly, the bridge collapsed in 1943, but it was rebuilt with the same rocks and is currently identical to the bridge the Romans built. It is located at the entrance of Joub Jannine on Joub Jannine- Chtoura Rd. Roman Bridge of Joub Jannine after its reconstruction. = Nightlife = noneJoub Jannine is known for its variety in restaurants and cafes which make it a destination town for most surrounding villages. All restaurants and fast food joints serve Nargila (Shisha). Nightlife exists but limited due to the towns size and distance from the major cities. Nightlife is limited to some operating cafeterias, bars and restaurants around the town which serve alcoholic drinks and quick bite plates and stay open a little past midnight.

Reception Local review site Idlebrain rated the film three and half stars and noted \\"Bala Krishna's terrific performance is the biggest strength of the film. First half of the film is entertaining. Second half is OK. And when Shiva Rama Krishna directs the heroine, the focus must be on the navel, this movie Heroine Asin opening starts with focus on Navel. The famous video song director seems to be normal in the outing, yet he never loses focus on the glamour of the girl and heroism of the hero at any given point.\\" Sify movies stated \\"Lakshmi Narasimha, the police story is being appreciated for its story, presentation and heroism of Balakrishna, the hero. It has taken a fantastic opening all over and is expected to be a long distance winner\\". Controversy Balakrishna was involved in a shooting controversy. The incident took place on 3 June 2004 around 20:50 hrs at his residence in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. The actor has fired shots at the producer B.Suresh and his associate, Satyanarayana Chowdhary. Later both the wounded were admitted into Apollo hospital. The circumstances under which the case was handled led to much controversy as purported by the Human Right Forum (HRF). The HRF has questioned the authenticity of people who handled the case, and the circumstances under which the actor was shielded from police by giving refuge in the CARE Hospital with out any justifiable cause. The two victims have given statements before the magistrate alleging that actor has fired shots at them during their treatment in the hospital but soon they were retracted and made volte-face of their earlier statements. The actor was arrested later on 6 June at around 3:30 AM and produced before fifth Metropolitan Magistrate. A show cause notice was also served on Bala Krishna's wife Vasundhara Devi as the weapon used was licensed under her name and she could not give sufficient protection to her licensed weapon.

The Return of Optimus Prime was created to bring Optimus Prime back into the Transformers universe due to the negative response from the public concerning his death in The Transformers: The Movie. The staff of the television series was brought back to work, after they had already completed work on the third season of the series, to animate the two part episode, which replaced the original season three finale, The Burden Hardest To Bear, which aired three months earlier. In advertising for the two part story, Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions treated this like a television event, with a ten-second announcement that played just before the end credits on the series for two weeks before the episodes aired, and a 30-second commercial to be aired during other programs.  Plot  = Part 1 = While testing a new heat- and radiation-resistant alloy in deep space, scientists Jessica Morgan and Gregory Swofford stumble upon an Autobot shuttle about to crash into a nearby star. A cursory evaluation of the shuttle reveals a deactivated Optimus Prime within. Jessica, unable to sit by and watch the Autobots' greatest leader die convinces Gregory to help her rescue him, despite Gregory's own reservations. In a previous accident stemmed by a conflict between Optimus and Megatron, which he blames on Optimus, Gregory's face was scarred, rendering him distrustful of any Transformer from then on. Fortunately, they are able to rescue the Autobot leader and move away from the shuttle as it collides with the star and causes it to nova, their alloy proving sufficient enough to withstand the intense heat and radiation the explosion produced. With both missions a success, they head for home, but not before Gregory notices a series of unusual spores attaching themselves to their ship's hull. Back on Earth, in Washington, D.C. , Gregory and Jessica's father begin running tests on the spores, and soon discover them to be a highly infectious contagion able to induce and exacerbate hatred and destructive impulses in any sentient being they contaminate. Despite the obvious danger, the two scientists are eager to continue studying the spores, a prospect Jessica openly objects to. Before a consensus can be formed, however, their lab is attacked by the Terrorcons, who are after their new alloy. The Technobots quickly join in to protect the humans and the metal, and in the resulting battle, Jessica is severely wounded and taken to the local hospital. This prompts an angry backlash from Jessica's father, who is encouraged by Gregory to get revenge on both factions by reviving Optimus and using him as a carrier for the plague. This is exacerbated when they learn Jessica was rendered paraplegic in the accident, and now needs a specialized exosuit to walk. Unfortunately for them, they are unable to revive Optimus, and are content to scrap his body to make more of their alloy. Jessica makes a futile attempt to save Optimus by appealing to her father's and Gregory's sense of morality, and is only successful when they realize that, as the Autobots' leader, they could use Optimus' body as bait to lure the rest of the Autobots into a trap. Because of her friendship with the Autobots, Jessica is forced to lure them into the trap, something she hates and hopes she will not learn to hate her father and colleague for. She arrives on scene with Ultra Magnus, and meets with the new leader, Rodimus Prime. She tells Rodimus it's a trap though he does not care and assembles an assault team to retrieve Optimus' body so he can rest in peace. Ratbat hears this and goes back to an abandoned football stadium where Soundwave plays the recorded conversation for Galvatron, who is planning to destroy Prime's body. Then he took off with Cyclonus, Scourge, the Sweeps, the Stunticons, the Combaticons and the Predacons, leaving Soundwave and Ratbat in the football stadium. When they get there, Rodimus tells Defensor and a few other Autobots to stay behind, while the rest retrieve Optimus, but warns them not to touch any red dust. Rodimus tells Ultra Magnus to take the Aerialbots and Throttlebots and retrieve Optimus' body, while Rodimus and Jessica distract Swofford and Morgan. Defensor and several Autbots stay behind to guard against the Decpticons. Rodimus and Jessica find the body of Optimus in the wrong room, and realize too late the trap that is being laid for the other Autobots. Gregory floods the lab containing Ultra Magnus, the Aerialbots and the Throttlebots with the red spores; infecting all of them. Morgan and Swofford's plan is successful as the spores make Ultra Magnus, the Aerialbots and Throttlebots go crazy and fight each other and quickly the Decepticons (except Galvatron) join the diseased army. Rodimus and Jessica escape from being infected and head back to headquarters to Wreck Gar, not knowing that Ultra Magnus is following. Defensor is seen clearing the bridge while the sickened Superion comes on scene and infects Defensor. Kup, Blurr, Wheelie, Steeljaw, and Bumblebee try to subdue Superion but become severely injured. Rodimus asks Wreck-Gar and the Junkions if they can revive Optimus but they are unsuccessful. Rodimus shuts down Metroplex so he cannot be infected and tells Sky Lynx to retrieve a Quintesson to revive him. The sickened Ultra Magnus appears and chases Rodimus to an alley. It seems like he's doomed only to be saved by Wreck Gar with his lasso, but unfortunately Wreck Gar gets infected, and quickly infects Rodimus. The spores travel throughout the galaxy pitting everyone against each other, human and Transformer alike. In space, Sky Lynx manages to find a Quintesson getting chased by a group of diseased Sharkticons. Sky Lynx says he will save the Quintesson, in exchange of reviving Optimus which he agrees. After a bit trouble, the duo revives Optimus, who awakens as the entire universe is descending into madness. = Part 2 = The episode begins with a revived Optimus thanking the Quintesson for bringing him back to life. Optimus then asks what happened and who is left. Sky Lynx informs him that the Autobots that escaped infection are in need of repairs by the Quintesson. Soon the uninfected are restored, but Bumblebee was too injured to be restored to himself and had to be rebuilt into a new body. Optimus gives him his new name: Goldbug. Optimus informs them that without the Matrix, all is lost and since it's inside Rodimus, he will need the heat resistant alloy. They set off leaving the Quintesson, Wheelie and Steeljaw at Metroplex. On Chaar, Galvatron is fighting his crazed minions and the Autobots save him. Galvatron then guides them to the alloy. Galvatron agrees to show them the room with the alloy. However, they find the way perilous. They make it in by avoiding a giant spider, energy sucking leeches and Galvatron's crazed minions. During the trip, Optimus' last wave of Autobots are infected by the crazed Transformers leaving only him, Galvatron, Jessica and Sky Lynx. After finding and loading the alloy, Cyclonus secretly infects Jessica who in turn infects Galvatron as he realizes why Optimus wants the alloy. Now everyone on Chaar is infected but Optimus and Sky Lynx who are forced to flee the planet leaving behind friends and foes alike. Back at Metroplex, they coat Optimus with the alloy, as they discover where Rodimus is. Sky Lynx drops Optimus off at a junkyard, where Rodimus is racing with the other infected Transformers. Optimus battles him for the Matrix but is nearly killed until the intervention of Sky Lynx in the battle, with the unfortunate result of Rodimus infecting Sky Lynx. Optimus knocks Rodimus unconscious on a conveyor belt, and retrieves the Matrix. At Metroplex, Optimus goes into the Matrix to seek a cure. Meanwhile, the crazed Transformers arrive as the Quintesson closes the door behind them to protect Optimus. Optimus finds the essence of Alpha Trion within the Matrix and he asks for the cure but Trion does not know it, so Optimus travels further back into the knowledge of the Matrix. An early Autobot leader reveals that they had encountered the spores, but could not find a cure. One of their old wise men was able to contain the spores and he injected himself into the sun - the same sun that these spores came out of. Optimus then realizes that wisdom is the cure and awakens just in time to use the wisdom of the Matrix to wipe out the plague, making everyone safe and sane again. In the aftermath, both Dr. Swofford and Dr. Morgan apologize for their actions, realizing their unfounded hate for the Autobots began a pandemic of hate. But Optimus refused as Galvatron, in a rare moment of calm, walked towards him and shaked his hand. Galvatron told Optimus that there will be no war today and has earned his respect. Also, in a surprising show of admiration, Galvatron orders a cease-fire (at least temporarily), his inherent madness apparently also cured by the Matrix's wisdom. Speaking of the Matrix, Rodimus, who becomes Hot Rod again, notes that the wisdom of the ancients is gone; Optimus disagrees, though, noting how they have all grown a little wiser from the experience, and must now fill the Matrix again with all their accumulated knowledge and experience from then on. The restored leader of the Autobots, Optimus orders them to \\"Transform and roll out (for home)\\".  Notes  The only four characters shown to definitely not get infected are Optimus Prime himself, Metroplex, the Quintesson, and Wheelie (who was mentioned, but didn't appear in the second part of the episode, because he was replaced by Blaster). The characters who only appeared in the early scenes which was before the plague and never got infected were The Technobots, the Terrorcons, Soundwave and Ratbat. The human survivors who are alive and never got infected by the plague were the doctors, nurses and patients from the General County Hospital where Jessica was taken in for operation, the police officers who helped the Autobots by trying to stop Superion, the civilians on the bridge where Defensor was trying to escape from Superion, Bonnie Carlson and some civilians in Washington, D.C. The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 1 marked the final appearances of three major Decepticons-Megatron (seen in a flashback), Soundwave and Ratbat (only seen giving the latest piece of information that Optimus Prime's body had been discovered) Stan Bush's The Touch from The Transformers: The Movie is heard at the climax of part two when Optimus unleashes the Matrix of Leadership. This episode is similar to Season 2 episodes \\"Megatron's Master Plan part 1 and 2 \\" and \\"Attack of the Autobots\\" as both involved human hatred to the Autobots and starting the catastrophe. After the catastrophe, Swofford and Morgan's apologies is similar to Shawn Berger's apologies to the Autobots and probably arrested offscreen in the episode climax. This episode directly contradicts the events of \\"Dark Awakening\\" (season 3 episode 8) where the Quintessons implanted Optimus Prime's body with special circuit that accessed \\"lingering remnants of his memory and personality\\" remarking that without those circuits \\"he would be utterly mindless, an ordinary machine. A robotic zombie.\\" \\"Dark Awakening\\" ended with Optimus Prime flying the autobot flagship into a Quintesson detonator causing the local sun to go nova incinerating him. More over in contrast to \\"Dark Awakening\\", Optimus Prime is totally undamaged in \\"The Return of Optimus Prime\\", The main locations that showed the infection scenes were set in Washington, D.C. , Paris, Moscow and Chaar. The other Countries, States, cities, town and villages are safe. It has been confirmed the citizens from the other places are hiding and defending themselves from the plague madness. Jessica Morgan, the main human protagonist of this two-part episode, replaced Spike Witwicky and Daniel Witwicky, the two human protagonists from the previous seasons. Originally, both Spike and Daniel were going to appear in this two-part episode to have a larger role. But, they were replaced by Jessica for unknown reasons. Although, Jessica's heroic role is similar to them as well.

During the New Deal, two of President Roosevelt's Brain Trust, Benjamin Cohen and Thomas Corcoran, rented the house for themselves and other young lawyers who drafted the New Deal legislation. Corcoran served as special counsel to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) from 1934 to 1941. During the same period, he was liaison to Henry Morgenthau, and represented him at RFC board of directors. As an ally of RFC Chairman Jesse H.

Felix Frankfurter had recommended many of his former Harvard Law students for work in the Roosevelt Administration, including Corcoran, leading the latter to be associated with a group known as \\"New Dealers.\\" According to Alan Brinkley, many regarded him as an organizer of the New Dealers and a coordinator of the Washington bureaucracy.

The film stars David Keith, Robert Prosky, Judge Reinhold, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Michael Biehn, and Olympic boxer Mark Breland. The college scenes were filmed primarily at Wellington College in England, as none of the American military academies would allow filming on their grounds because of the book's less-than-positive portrayal of life at a military academy.MILITARY-SCHOOL MOVIE WORRIES THE CITADEL'S CHIEFS, New York Times, September 6, 1982 The film was not filmed entirely in England. The restaurant scene with Bobby Bentley, Commerce's home, and the train track scene were filmed in Charleston, South Carolina, over a period of two weeks. Plot Will McLean is a senior cadet at the Carolina Military Institute, a school that outwardly promises to produce men of honor but practices brutal hazing against the junior cadets. Among these are the overweight Poteete and the Institute's first black cadet, Tom Pearce. McLean's mentor, Lt. Col. \\"Bear\\" Berrineau, asks him to protect Pearce. McLean's roommates at the Institute are \\"Pig\\" Pignetti, Mark Santoro and Tradd St. Croix, the last of whom offers him a key to his parents' house. As the term begins, McLean's roommates participate in breaking in the new cadets, while McLean remains aloof. This draws the attention of the school's commanding officer, Lt. Gen. Bentley Durrell, who warns him not to be soft. Both Poteete and Pearce become targets of the Ten, a traditional clandestine group of seniors dedicated to ridding the school of \\"unfit\\" cadets. Poteete is left standing all night on a high ledge, in which McLean is able to save him from falling the next morning; and Pearce is attacked and has the number 10 carved in his back. In addition, Pearce had razor blades placed in his athletic shoes, and suffers multiple, small lacerations. McLean's attempts to protect him are thwarted when someone intercepts their communications. Together with his roommates, he kidnaps Dan McIntyre, a former member of the Ten, and forces him to disclose the location of the Hole, the place where they take cadets to be tortured. McLean and his friends arrive at the Hole just as Pearce is threatened with immolation. They distract the Ten and McLean unmasks one of them, John Alexander. The Ten retaliate by having Pignetti charged with theft and expelled by an Honor Court that they control. Alexander issues a large number of demerits against the rest of McLean's faction, placing them also at risk of expulsion. McLean offers to resign if Alexander will show leniency towards Santoro and Tradd, which Alexander accepts. Before he can submit his resignation, McLean sees McIntyre on campus meeting with Bear and Tradd's father. He enters the St. Croix house and discovers the history of the Ten from Mr. St. Croix's journals. Not only have the Ten been operating for years, but Durrell supports their activities. Most shockingly, Tradd is a member and has kept them ahead of McLean at every step. McLean confronts Tradd and throws the house key at him. McLean returns to the Institute and marches into Durrell's office. He demands that the senior class, with Pignetti reinstated, be allowed to graduate; that the Ten be disbanded and exposed; and that Durrell resign at the end of the year. If Durrell does not agree, the journals will be sent to the press. Durrell accepts the terms for the sake of the Institute. McLean remains at CMI until graduation day to see the deal through, but he remains disgusted by the corruption and chooses not to graduate himself. As he walks out the gates of the Institute, Bear hands him his class ring, telling him that he earned it.

It surrounded the area that is now Rt. 39, between Geneseo and Cuylerville, New York. At the time of its destruction by Sullivan, the town was located on the west side of the Genesee River. Ten years prior, it had been on the east side of the river, as the Seneca villages were generally moved approximately every 10 years. The town was named after its founder, Little Beard, a prominent Seneca sachem in the late 18th century. It was famous for its beautiful surroundings and the productivity of its vegetable gardens, fruit orchards, and fields of corn. It had about 130 houses-- \\"finely built log cabins with ample furnishings; some even had glass window panes,\\" as well as a large council building, built around a central square. It was located near three other Seneca towns, all of which were destroyed during the Sullivan Expedition in the American Revolutionary War. The Seneca and three other Iroquois nations fought on the British side during the American Revolutionary War. Little Beard and his warriors participated in the Cherry Valley massacre and the Boyd and Parker ambush, in which two soldiers were brought to Little Beard's Town and tortured. Subsequently, troops of the Continental Army under Major General John Sullivan attacked Little Beard's Town and other Iroquois settlements in the Genesee and Mohawk valleys, destroying buildings and crops. The residents had to flee. \\"Little Beard's Town was burnt by Sullivan-Clinton‚Äôs forces on Sept. 14-15, 1779.\\" One famous resident fled with the Seneca to more secure villages, around Niagara Falls, with three children. This was Mary Jemison, a Scots-Irish immigrant colonist who had been captured by the Seneca at age 15 with her family, most of whom were killed. She was adopted and married into the tribe, and lived with them all her life. A fictional account of the burning of the town is given in The Scouts of the Valley by Joseph A. Altsheler. \\"The Men in Sullivans Army were so greatly impressed by the 22 inch long ears of corn, the fine vegetable gardens and the fruit orchards that many determined to return and settle on this land after the war.\\" Cuylerville was later built on the site of Little Beard's Town by European-American settlers.

It was situated in an area corresponding to the region around modern-day Ha»õeg, Hunedoara County, Romania. Maastrichtian fossils of small-sized dinosaurs have been found in the island's rocks. It was formed mainly by tectonic uplift during the early Alpine orogeny, caused by the collision of the African and Eurasian plates towards the end of the Cretaceous. There is no real present-day analog, but overall, the island of Hainan (off the coast of China) is perhaps closest as regards climate, geology and topography, though still not a particularly good match. The vegetation, for example, was of course entirely distinct from today, as was the fauna. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa theorized that \\"limited resources\\" found on the island commonly have an effect of \\"reducing the size of animals\\" over the generations, producing a localized form of dwarfism. Nopcsa's theory of insular dwarfism‚Äîalso known as the island rule‚Äîis today widely accepted. Geography While a variety of estimates regarding the prehistoric island's size have been given over the years, the most reliable estimate places it at roughly 80,000 square kilometers during the Maastrichtian, or about the size of the modern island of Hispaniola. It was positioned just within the equatorial belt, at about 27¬∞N latitude.Benton, M.J., Csiki, Z., Grigorescu, D., Redelstorff, R., Sander, P.M., Stein, K., and Weishampel, D.B. (2010). \\"Dinosaurs and the island rule: The dwarfed dinosaurs from Ha≈£eg Island. \\" Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 293(3-4): 438‚Äì454. Ha≈£eg Island was probably located at least from the nearest land mass. To the northwest was an island corresponding to the Bohemian Massif, to the southeast was an island corresponding to the Balkan‚ÄìRhodope Massif (including the modern Rhodope Mountains region), and to the west was a large island corresponding to part of the modern Iberian land mass. The closest continental land mass were portions of the Austro-Alpine region to the west and the Adriatic region to the south. Ha≈£eg Island itself was surrounded primarily by a deep marine basin, unlike some of the surrounding islands and land masses which were surrounded by shallow seas. Climate and ecology During the Maastrichtian, the climate of Ha≈£eg Island was sub-tropical, with an average temperature of 20-25 degrees Celsius. The island experience marked rainy and dry seasons, but despite this the plant life on the island was mainly tropical in nature. Carbon isotopes indicate \\"dry woodland\\" conditions. This seeming contradiction between the seasonally dry climate and tropical plant species can be explained by the fact that tropical plants can thrive in a seasonally monsoonal environment today as long as they have access to sufficient amounts of water year-round, and the Ha≈£eg environment seems to have been dominated by braided rivers and lakes. Early rock layers are dominated by volcanic deposits, but these are absent in higher layers, indicating that volcanic activity dropped off during this time. Paleofauna The local macropredator Hatzegopteryx hunting the herbivore Zalmoxes A restoration of Balaur bondoc and the forest vegetation found in Ha»õeg Island Zalmoxes robustus, a herbivorous dinosaur from the Ha»õeg Island ecosystem About nine species of dinosaurs, and several species of pterosaur are thought to have been indigenous to the island. Most of these animals were smaller versions of mainland megafauna, which became smaller due to island dwarfism, although this is certainly not the case for Hatzegopteryx which, being one of the biggest pterosaurs ever, is an example of island gigantism.

It was located close to the village of Faldingworth in Lincolnshire, England. Development By 1936 the RAF Expansion Scheme had overseen a period of rapid increases both in terms of aircraft operated and the development of new stations. The Faldingworth site was one of several earmarked under the expansion programme. As it developed, it made an increasingly dramatic imposition on the surrounding rural landscapehttp://lincolnshire.moderngov.co.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=1891 such as to the Lincolnshire Edge, a Jurassic limestone ridge, which forms the distinctive backbone of the county from Whitton on the Humber Estuary in the north, down to Grantham in the south. It provides a continuous homogenous landscape of high quality agricultural land, with a number of local variations. To the west of the Edge, the gently undulating Trent Vale eventually flows into the moors and levels of Humberhead, draining to the Humber Estuary. To the east there is a gentle transition into the Central Lincolnshire Vale between the Humber and Lincoln, while south of Lincoln the Edge is bounded by a narrow finger of Fenland, which follows the River Witham into Lincoln. To the south, the Edge merges into the more undulating Kesteven Uplands. Along the top of the Edge a series of airfields were developed. They lie within an open landscape, consisting of rectilinear fields and few boundaries. History Faldingworth entered service life as Toft Grange decoy airfield and later as a satellite airfield of RAF Lindholme. Late in 1943 it became a satellite of RAF Ludford Magna. After the war the base was used for storage of weapons. In 1957 the site became a nuclear weapons store for the RAF's V bomber force. In times of crisis nuclear weapons from the site would be distributed to the nearby V-bomber airfields such as RAF Scampton, RAF Finningley and RAF Coningsby. With the transfer of the UK nuclear deterrent role to the Royal Navy's s in 1968 the site was run down and finally deactivated in 1972. In 1959 there was an oxygen production unit operating on the opposite side of the airfield to the nuclear weapons storage site. Two BA1D air separation units were operated on a 24-hour basis to provide a ready supply of breathable oxygen for the aircrew of the V-bombers. At that time RAF Faldingworth was a satellite station of RAF Scampton. Current Ordnance Survey maps show the remains of a typical wartime bomber airfield, with the former storage site overlaying the southwestern part of the airfield, about east of Spridlington. There is a cluster of 127 RAF-built houses northeast of the airfield area, sold to Roger Byron-Collins' Welbeck Estate Group in 1979 and renamed The Virginia Estate. A group of RAF buildings is used as an industrial estate.

Liquidator is a person officially appointed to 'liquidate' a company or firm. Their duty is to ascertain and settle the liabilities of a company or a firm. If there are any surplus, then those are distributed to the contributories. Origins In English law, the term \\"liquidator\\" was first used in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856. Prior to that time, the equivalent role was fulfilled by \\"official managers\\" pursuant to the amendments to the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 passed in 1848 - 1849. Powers In most jurisdictions, a liquidator's powers are defined by statute.In the United Kingdom, they are set in Schedule 4 to the Insolvency Act 1986 Certain powers are generally exercisable without the requirement of any approvals; others may require sanction, either by the court, by an extraordinary resolution (in a members' voluntary winding up) or the liquidation committee or a meeting of the company's creditors .In the United Kingdom, see sections 165-168 of the Insolvency Act 1986 The liquidator would normally require sanction to pay and to make compromises or arrangement with creditors. Without sanction , the liquidator may carry on legal proceedings and carry on the business of the company so far as may be necessary for a beneficial winding-up. Without sanction, the liquidator may sell company property, claim against insolvent contributories, raise money on the security of company assets, and do all such things as may be necessary for the winding-up and distribution of assets. Duties In compulsory liquidation, the liquidator must assume control of all property to which the company appears to be entitled. In the United Kingdom, see section 144 of the Insolvency Act 1986 The exercise of their powers is subject to the supervision of the court. They may be compelled to call a meeting of creditors or contributories when requested to do so by those holding above the statutory minimum.In the United Kingdom, one-tenth of the total value. See section 168 of the Insolvency Act 1986 In a voluntary winding-up, the liquidator may exercise the court's power of settling a list of contributories and of making calls, and he may summon general meetings of the company for any purpose he thinks fit.In the United Kingdom, see section 165 of the Insolvency Act 1986 In a creditor's voluntary winding-up, he must report to the creditor's meeting on the exercise of his powers.In the United Kingdom, see section 166 of the Insolvency Act 1986 The liquidator is generally obliged to make returns and accounts,In the United Kingdom, see section 170 of the Insolvency Act 1986 owes fiduciary duties to the company and should investigate the causes of the company's failure and the conduct of its managers, in the wider public interest of action being taken against those engaged in commercially culpable conduct.Re Pantmaenog [2004] 1 AC 158 A liquidator who is appointed to wind-up a failing business should act with professional efficiency and not exercise the sort of complacency that might have caused the business to decline in the first place. Misconduct Where, during the investigation of the affairs of the company, the liquidator uncovers wrongdoing on the part of the management of the company, he may have power to bring proceedings for wrongful trading or, in extreme cases, for fraudulent trading. However, the liquidator cannot normally enter into a champertous agreement to assign the fruits of an action to a third party offering to finance the litigation, if the right to said action accrued solely as a result of the liquidator's statutory duties, instead of being a right to action that had existed before the liquidator came on the scene.Re Oasis Merchandising [1998] 1 Ch 170 The liquidator may also seek to set aside transactions which were entered into by the company in the time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation where he forms the view that they constitute an unfair preference or a transaction at an undervalue. Removal Depending upon the type of the liquidation, the liquidator may be removed by the court, by a general meeting of the members or by a general meeting of the creditors.In the United Kingdom, see sections 171-172 of the Insolvency Act 1986 The court may also remove a liquidator and appoint another if there is \\"cause shown\\" by the applicant for his removal. It is not normally necessary to demonstrate personal misconduct or unfitness for this purpose. However, it will be enough if the liquidator fails to display sufficient vigour in the discharge of his duties, for instance, by not establishing the current assets and recent trading of the company or in not attempting to secure favourable terms for the company in relation to the disposal of its assets.Re Keypak Homecare Ltd [1987] BCLC 409 In Australia, a liquidator may be removed by a creditor's resolution, or application to the court.

Bonney, also known as Billy the Kid.  Circumstances leading to the shooting of Pat Garrett  Born in Kansas' Greenwood County, Brazel was residing in New Mexico when, on February 29, 1908, he met Garrett on a road near Las Cruces. The two had been involved in prior disputes over Brazel's use of land he leased from Garrett. An argument between Brazel and Garrett resulted in Brazel producing a handgun and shooting Garrett as Garrett was alleged to have reached for a shotgun under his seat on a wagon. This version of what happened was supported by another local resident, Carl Adamson, who was accompanying Garrett when the encounter occurred. The dispute started over Brazel having leased land from Garrett, then grazing goats on it against Garrett's wishes. Brazel and Adamson went to the authorities, where Brazel confessed to the crime. The specifics of the confession, however, have been described as inconsistent and vague when subjected to detailed scrutiny. Observers knowledgeable with the matter have speculated that it was difficult to believe that Brazel, who was good natured and who had no prior criminal history, could commit murder. Adamson was a cousin of outlaw and killer-for- hire Jim Miller, which has given rise to conspiracy theories. An alleged meeting attended by several businessmen and outlaws who disliked Garrett was held on an unspecified date in 1907 at the St. Regis Hotel in the Texas city of El Paso, bordering on New Mexico and Mexico. In attendance, along with Brazel, Miller and Adamson, were Oliver Lee, Bill McNew, and W. W. Cox. It has been alleged that a plan to kill Garrett was set at the meeting, but the exact details of that gathering are doubtful. Garrett had numerous verbal and business disputes with other landowners over watering rights and, with advancing age, his disposition made him a very disliked man. He had been involved in a gunbattle with Lee and another man while working on the Albert Jennings Fountain disappearance case, resulting in one of Garrett's deputies being killed, and the eventual arrest but not conviction of Lee. He was deeply in debt, had a gambling addiction, and was temperamental. In the years following his killing of Billy the Kid, the circumstances surrounding the event came into question, and many believed that instead of acting in the name of the law, he had committed cold blooded murder by ambushing the Kid. Such speculations made him seem no longer as a \\"dangerous man\\", but rather an opportunist who sought glory and benefits from that exploit.  Allegations of a conspiracy  W. W. Cox was said to have offered to fund the killing. Miller was to be the man who carried it out. Oliver Lee is alleged to have come up with the plan to have Brazel lease land from Garrett, then graze goats on it, knowing that such use of his property would provoke a violent reaction from Garrett. In light of Garrett's history, it would ultimately lead to a confrontation, in the aftermath of which self-defense could be claimed. Miller was to receive $1,500 for the killing, a typical rate for him, since there was confirmation at the time that had taken the lives of at least seven men in hired killings. Miller was alleged to have lain in wait for the wagon carrying Adamson and Garrett, with Adamson stopping in a predetermined location, at which time Miller simply walked out and shot him, then returned to Fort Worth. Brazel, with no prior history whatsoever, could easily claim self-defense against Garrett, who had killed at least four men in his lifetime, and was known to always carry the sawed-off shotgun under his seat. In 2016, a Do√±a Ana County Clerk‚Äôs Office employee came across that document in a box of unarchived materials. Dated February 29, 1908, the handwritten Coroner‚Äôs Jury Report ‚Äì signed by seven jurors ‚Äì reads as follows: \\"We the undersigned Justices of the Peace and Coroners Jury have attended the investigation of the body of Pat Garrett who was reported dead within the limits of Precinct No. 20, County of Do√±a Ana, territory of New Mexico on about five miles northeast of the town of Las Cruces and find that the deceased came to his death by gunshot wounds inflicted by one Wayne Brazel.\\" However, it was later pointed out by historian Leon Metz that simply because Brazel's story as to how he killed Garrett coincides with the above account, it does not mean he was lying about killing Garrett, or how it happened. Garrett was reportedly a hot- tempered man and was angry with Brazel over the grazing of the goats. Miller was not known to have been in New Mexico at that time, and is believed to have been in Oklahoma. Metz, however, appears not to have known that Garrett was on his way to Las Cruces to meet with Miller. The Roswell Daily Record, March 3, 1908 Another theory is that Adamson was involved in the conspiracy so that he might be able to obtain Garrett's land as a staging area for his illegal smuggling operations in the course of which he imported Chinese men to work in the garment and mining industries, and Chinese women to work as prostitutes. He was arrested shortly after the killing of Garrett for human smuggling, but there is no proof that he was connected in any way with a preconceived murder plot, short of his presence at the above mentioned meeting.  Remaining years and nephew's role in the Roswell UFO legend  Brazel married and acquired a small ranch just west of the nearby small city of Lordsburg a couple of years after the killing. In his late thirties when his wife died in 1913, he sold the property and disappeared from public record. The period and circumstances of his death remain unconfirmed, but word of mouth has indicated that it may have been two years later. A little over thirty years later, in early July 1947, his nephew William \\"Mac\\" Brazel gained certain fame in the so-called Roswell UFO incident when he allegedly found strange debris on his ranch some 70 miles northwest of Roswell, sparking the claim that a flying saucer crashed on the ranch where Brazel was foreman and that the government subsequently instituted a cover-up.

History The territory around Buffalo Creek was conquered by the Seneca in the 1600s from the Wenrohronon, also called Wenro. Sometime between 1660 and 1690 the Seneca began to occupy the area. This was during the period of the Beaver Wars, when the Iroquois nations worked to expand their territory and hunting grounds. During the American Revolution, the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 destroyed many towns of the Seneca, as they were allies of the British. The homeless people fled to the protection of the British at Fort Niagara. At one point the British were reported to be feeding and housing over 5000 refugees. Following a terrible winter of 1779‚Äì80 at Niagara, the Iroquois began to disperse. Joseph Brant took a group of mixed tribal members to the Grand River in Canada, where the Crown promised them a large grant of land. The Tuscarora went to Lewiston. The remaining Seneca, Cayugas, and Onondaga peoples, led by Sayenqueraghta (Old King) and his son-in-law Roland Montour, chose to settle at Buffalo Creek. Because the Seneca had been allies of the defeated British, the US forced them to cede most of their territory. By the Treaty of Big Tree in 1797, the Seneca relinquished all of Western New York except for twelve reservations, including Buffalo Creek. This reservation encompassed much of the present site of the city of Buffalo, New York, as well as its southern and western suburbs. By 1817 an estimate placed the population on the reservation at around 700 Seneca, plus small numbers of other displaced people. In 1838 the United States forced the Seneca to agree to the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, which was part of the Indian Removal policy initiated by the President Andrew Jackson administration. It required the Seneca of western New York to cede all their reservation lands and move west of the Mississippi River, specifically to Wisconsin and Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), within five years. After the land sale that required the treaty fell through, the US negotiated a new treaty, which the Senate ratified in 1842. The Seneca began selling portions of the reservation in the 1840s to European Americans, members of the Ebenezer Society. The Buffalo Creek reservation was the only reservation to be dissolved: the Seneca were allowed to keep Cattaraugus, Oil Springs, Allegany and Tonawanda reservations after legal battles in the 1850s fought by Onondaga chief Samuel George and other leaders. Current status The modern Buffalo Creek Reservation consists of a nine-acre plot of land, which was part of the original reservation. In 2010, the Seneca bought the land from Carl Paladino, whose Ellicott Development Company continues to own much of the surrounding land.\\"Carl Paladino: The accidental candidate\\", Crain's New York Business, 26 September 2010 The Seneca developed the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino on this property, the revenues of which are used for economic development.

It is part of the Clearview Local School District, one of five school districts serving the city of Lorain and all of Sheffield Township, Ohio. Clearview High School houses students in grades 9-12. It was formerly named Clearview Junior-Senior High School and housed students in grades 7-12. After a remodeling project across the district in the early 2000s, grades 7 and 8 moved to Durling Middle School, just northwest of the high school. Of the five school districts that are wholly or partially within the city of Lorain, Clearview serves the second largest population of Lorain students, with Lorain High School being the largest. The other local school districts are Amherst, Firelands, Vermilion and Eyria. At one time Lorain City Schools wanted the Clearview students that lived in the Lorain city part of the Clearview Local School District. The school colors are blue and gold. The sports teams are known as the Clippers. The school's fight song, instrumentally, is the fight song from Washington State University. CHS History Logo of the Clearview Clippers Clearview High School was built in 1923, then named Highland, and including grades 4-8. The building consisted of six classrooms, two bathrooms, auditorium/gymnasium and an office. At this time, Clearview (Highland) was part of the Sheffield Lake School District. In 1927, six more classrooms were added. The Clearview Local School District was formed by a petition of the Lorain County Board of Education on April 9, 1928. In 1930 the name was changed to Clearview High School to reflect the new school district. That year, the auditorium/gymnasium was remodeled and could seat 555 people. The school doubled in size by adding home economics, manual training and mechanical drawing rooms. A year later, in 1931, the first graduating class of CHS with eleven graduates received their diplomas. The football field (Tom Hoch Field) was built in 1937. In 1940 shop classes and a garage were added. In 1957 a new gymnasium, junior high wing with nine classrooms, cafeteria, music/band room and offices were added. In 1961 the science wing was added and in 1968 a new library, arts and classrooms were added. On May 5, 1969 a major arson fire was set in the attic of the old 1923 section. The fire was contained to only the old section, thanks to the fire department and the fire doors which split the old section from the new sections. Damage was done to the auditorium, hallways, classrooms, and study hall, and the roof fell in. The newest and last addition was completed in 2004 thanks to the Ohio School Facilities Commission; the school district received about $23 million. CHS received 10 million dollars to demolish, renovate and expand. The old sections built in 1923, 1927, 1930 and 1940 were demolished to make way for new classrooms. The rest of the school received a major renovation, and a new classroom wing was added behind the old junior high wing. Central air conditioning was added. A new auditorium, music and band rooms were built. The old study hall became the new weight room, and the old PPO office and hallway area formed a new practice room for the wrestling team. The school was made grades 9-12 only, and junior high was placed at the newly formed Durling Middle School. In 2008 the Frank and Anne Szalay Gymnasium replaced the bleachers with new ones that spell out \\"Clearview\\" on the home side and Clippers on the visitors' side. This was accomplished by fundraising efforts. Academics Students with high GPAs are eligible to attend Lorain County Community College through the Post-Secondary Enrollment Options Program (PSEO). Juniors and seniors also may attend the Lorain County JVS in Oberlin. Students attending LCCC or LCJVS are officially Clearview students. Many students participating in one of these programs split their days between the high school site and LCCC/LCJVS. Clearview High School traditionally sends a vast majority of its students to additional education, whether in college, vocational training or enlistment in the military after commencement. Seniors participate in the High School Recognition Assembly at Clearview High School before commencement exercises are held at the Lorain Palace Theater. Extracurricular activities The Clearview Clippers competed in the Stripes Division of the Patriot Athletic Conference but, as of 2019, reformed the Lorain County Conference with 8 other schools in baseball, basketball (boys' and girls'), bowling, cross country, football, softball, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. The Clearview football team plays home games at Tom Hoch Field at the high school complex, and the Clearview basketball, volleyball and wrestling teams play home games at the Frank and Anne Szalay Gymnasium. Clearview was a former member of the Lakeland Conference and the Lorain County Conference; both are now defunct. Additionally, several teams compete at a club level, including Academic Challenge. The Clearview Clippers finished the 2008 football regular season undefeated at 10-0. They lost their opening round state playoff game to Ottawa-Glandorf High School, 41-14. Other CHS organizations include Blue Crew, cheerleading, National Honor Society, President's Club, Band, student council, yearbook and Youth for Youth.

As a merchant, John Rowe's most famous cargo was the tea that played a starring role in the Boston Tea Party. As a developer, his name is remembered to this day in the name of Rowes Wharf, a modern development in downtown Boston on the site of his original wharf. Rowe lived on Bedford Street, Boston, 1764-1787State Street Trust Company. Forty of Boston's historic houses. 1912. Biography Rowe was born in Exeter, in the English county of Devon, but immigrated to Boston with his brothers at an early age. He married Hannah Speakman in 1743 and lived in Boston for the rest of his life. His diaries are kept by the Massachusetts Historical Society and include many valuable observations about people, events, and daily life in Boston. He held various posts in Boston, including serving on the Boston Board of Selectmen. Rowe was evidently a very active smuggler, avoiding British trade regulations by trading with forbidden ports.John W. Tyler. \\"Rowe, John\\"; American National Biography Online, Feb. 2000. He was also an active slave dealer, shown by his advertisement in the 28 July 1746 edition of the Boston Evening Post. In the ad, Rowe listed goods for auction at his wharf, such as cocoa and rum. After the list of goods, he offered to purchase, \\"Some Negroes that can work at the Carpenter's Trade\\", and promised to \\"give a handsom[e] Price if he likes them.\\"Matthew Kaminski. \\"Freemason Grand Master John Rowe: The Force of Power\\"; self-published, 2014. He joined protests against tightening restrictions of colonial trade, and helped incite the anti-Stamp Act riot in 1765 that destroyed Chief Justice Thomas Hutchinson's home. Carl Becker mostly ignored John Rowe in The Eve of Revolution (1918), but he did include a letter written by Thomas Hutchinson. In the letter, Hutchinson claimed that Rowe, Otis and Molineux and Davies provoked the protesters who destroyed Hutchinson's house on 26 August 1765: \\"When there is occasion to burn or hang effigies or pull down houses, these [rabble] are employed; but since government has been brought to a system, they are somewhat controlled by a superior set consisting of the mastermasons, and carpenters, &c.;, of the town of Boston. When anything of more importance is to be determined, as opening the custom-house on any matter of trade, these are under the direction of a committee of the merchants, Mr. Rowe at their head, then Molyneaux, Solomon Davies, et&,‚Ä¶this is proper for a general meeting of the inhabitants of Boston, where Otis, with his mob-high of eloquence, prevails in every motion‚Ä¶ and it would be a very extraordinary resolve indeed that is not carried into execution\\". During the era of the American Revolution, Rowe avoided commitment to either side, and instead looked out after his business interests. Rowe was the owner of one of the tea ships, the Eleanor, involved in the Boston Tea Party. According to some accounts, at the Old South Meeting House before the Tea Party, he uttered the famous words, \\"perhaps salt water and tea will mix tonight,\\" but according to his own diary, he was unwell and was not present during the meeting or the Tea Party. Because several sources placed Rowe at the meeting, it's possible to theorise that the diary entry may have been an attempt to conceal his participation in the events leading to the Tea Party.John W.

The team plays in the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship (RCNJC) and draws most of its players from the Newfoundland Rugby Union, one of fourteen Rugby Unions that have representative teams in the RCNJC. The organization was originally a competitor at the senior men's level. However, with a 2009 restructuring of Canada's rugby competitions, their place has been taken by a successor organization, the Atlantic Rock, a regional team in the Americas Rugby Championship. The Rock play their home games at Swilers Rugby Park in St. John's. History In 1998, Rugby Canada and the provincial unions agreed to form the Rugby Canada Super League (RCSL). Fourteen unions and sub-unions were invited to compete in the new semi-professional league. The Rock were significantly successful in the RCSL, winning the Eastern Division to advance to the National Final match five of the league's eleven seasons. During the eighth season of the Super League (2005), the Rock became the first team from the East to win the league Championship defeating the Saskatchewan Prairie Fire (26-13) and again the following season (28-14). The Rock lost the Eastern Final to the Niagara Thunder the following year, but returned in 2008 to beat the Calgary Mavericks for a third title, and the final one of the RCSL's history. In 2009, Rugby Canada and the IRB decided to expand the NA4 competition to become the Americas Rugby Championship. In this new competition, there would be four Canadian teams, with one to represent Canada's five easternmost provinces, based from St. John's. Additionally, the RCSL was disbanded, to be replaced with a new Under-20 league called the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship. The Rock was chosen as one of the remaining RCSL clubs to enter the newly formed league.

Both patents were continuation applications of a patent application originally filed in November 1995. Nintendo was not involved in the case, as the technology used in the Rumble Pak and GameCube controller (and, subsequently, the Wii Remote) is based on a different design, for which Nintendo holds the patents and based on a Japan patent application filed on October 9, 1995. While Microsoft settled out of court, purchasing a 10% share in Immersion, Sony continued to defend the case. Immersion's lead attorney in this case was Morgan Chu.Bringardner, John. \\"Patents Take to the Big Screen\\". Law Technology News. November 29, 2004. The defense centered on a force feedback controller patent which Sony licensed from Logitech during 1998. Sony lost, with the jury awarding Immersion $82 million for the seven years that the DualShock controller had been on the market, which with the judge's addition of pre-judgment interest and costs, totalled $90.7 million. In addition, the judgment required Sony to suspend the sale of all controllers containing Immersion-patented technology, including all PlayStation and PlayStation 2 console packages. Sony appealed this decision and has been able to sell its products while the appeal was being heard. On March 8, 2006, Sony lost the appeal at the US District Court level and subsequently appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.Immersion Corporation Reports First Quarter 2006 Financial Results The order to halt sales of the infringing controllers was again stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.

WCTO is owned by Cumulus Media and serves the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. The station offers a country music format, playing country music from the 1980s through to the present. Being part of the Eagles Radio Network, WCTO broadcasts all Philadelphia Eagles games. History 96.1 FM began in 1947 as WEST-FM. For decades, the station simulcast WEST's middle of the road popular music format. In 1973, though, 96.1 became WLEV and began offering a soft rock/adult contemporary format that was very automated. It played the softer rock hits of the 1960s and 1970s, along with a lot of current music. It was known as \\"Hit Parade Music\\" at one point. The station was owned by Sound Media and then by Telemedia Group. Through the 1970s and into the 1980s, WLEV 96.1 continued as an adult contemporary station with no dramatic changes. More personality was added in the late 1980s and, by the 1990s, the station bordered on being a hot adult contemporary station, but the texture of the station was consistent. In 1995, the station was sold, along with WEST, to Citadel Broadcasting. Still, the format remained adult contemporary. In 1997, Citadel acquired WFMZ FM, which by then had a format that was evolving to be musically closer to WLEV. In 1997, it was decided that there was no need for two AC stations in the Lehigh Valley, so they combined aspects of the AC formats from both stations and moved the WLEV call letters and format and some of the air staff to 100.7 that July. 96.1 became Cat Country WCTO and played a country music format. As a country music station, the station achieves some very high ratings. It has a live air staff almost full-time and focuses on country hits of the 1980s, 1990s and current music. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. Jingles and sweepers From the beginning of 2000, WCTO used Reelworld custom packages, and continues to do so. Starting on May 17, 2009, the station dropped all RW packages minus their 06 package, and started to broadcast a brand new jingle service at that time, Reelworld One Country. Since January 1, 2011, the station uses the entire back service which includes the entire back catalog. Sweeper wise, the station started to use John Willyard with a little help from the late Billy Moore for the launch in 1997, and still uses him to this day.

He and seven others were charged in conspiring to assassinate Lincoln and three other high level government officials. Spangler was the only one found not guilty of the conspiracy charge. Even so, he was found guilty of helping Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, escape and sentenced to six years of hard labor.Steers Jr., Edward, editor (2013) The Trial: The assassination of President Lincoln and the trial of the conspirators: A special edition of the trial transcript as compiled and arranged in 1865 by Benn Pitman. pp 248-249. . Background Spangler was born in York, Pennsylvania, one of four sons of William Spangler, a county sheriff. Spangler's mother died when he was an infant. He was baptized as \\"Edmund Spangler\\" at the First Reformed Church in York on August 10, 1825. Throughout his life, Spangler went by several names; as an adult, friends and co-workers knew him as \\"Ned\\", after his arrest, he signed his statement as \\"Edman Spangler\\" while family records name him \\"Edmund/Edward\\". While in his early 20s, Spangler trained as a carpenter. He eventually moved to Maryland and began working with another carpenter, James Johnson Gifford. In the early 1850s, Spangler and Gifford helped to construct Tudor Hall, the summer retreat for the Booth family. It was during this time that Spangler met future stage actor John Wilkes Booth who was then a child. In 1853, Spangler moved to Baltimore where he worked as an assistant to Gifford at the Front Street and Holliday Street Theaters. In 1858, Spangler married Mary Brasheare. In 1861, the couple relocated to Washington, D.C., where Spangler began working as a carpenter and scene shifter at Ford's Theatre. It was while working at Ford's Theatre that Spangler became reacquainted with John Wilkes Booth. By that time, Booth had become a renowned and popular stage actor. Spangler was dazzled by Booth's fame and charm and, despite the fact that Booth was thirteen years Spangler's junior, was always eager to complete whatever tasks Booth assigned him. Like Booth, Spangler opposed the abolition of slavery and considered himself a Secessionist. He would often butt heads with co-worker Jake Rittersbach who was a veteran of the Union Army.Bogar 2013 pp.48-49 After Spangler's wife died in 1864, he began drinking very heavily. Although he became disagreeable after drinking too much, friends described him as a generally congenial and endearing \\"drudge\\" when sober and noted his love for practical jokes, children, and animals.Bogar 2013 pp.49-50 Assassination On April 2, 1865 Richmond, the Confederate capitol, fell to Union forces. On April 9 General Lee's Northern Virginia army surrendered to the Union Forces. These two events were evidence that after four long years the civil war was finally nearing its end even though there were still Confederate forces in the field throughout the South though clearly not enough to bring about a Confederate victory. Five days later President Lincoln and his wife Mary decided to attend a performance of Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater. During that afternoon Spangler was asked by his employer, Harry Clay Ford, to help prepare the State Box for the President's anticipated attendance that evening. He helped bring in furniture and remove the partition which converted the two boxes, numbers 7 and 8, into a single box. Later Booth showed up at the theater and invited Spangler and other stagehands of Ford's out for a drink. Booth indicated to the employees that he might come back for the evening's performance. At about 9:30 pm, Booth again appeared at the theatre. He dismounted in the alley to the rear of Ford's and asked for Spangler. When Spangler came out, Booth asked him to hold the mare he had hired from the stables of James W. Pumphrey. Pumphrey had warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and she would break her halter if left unattended. Spangler explained he had work to do and asked Joseph Burroughs, another Ford's employee, to do so. Burroughs, whose nickname was \\"Peanut John\\" (or \\"Johnny Peanut\\"), agreed to hold the horse. At about 10:15 PM John Wilkes Booth entered the president's box and assassinated Lincoln and then quickly escaped from the theater. Arrest, trial, and conviction Edmund Spangler It did not take long for military investigators to unravel the plot not only to assassinate the president but also Secretary of State William Seward, Vice President Andrew Johnson and General Ulysses Grant. The Union believed this an act of war orchestrated by the Confederate government in a desperate attempt to continue the war. Seen as an act of war the Union government would try those they felt responsible in a military trial rather than a civil trial. Spangler was questioned on April 15, 1865, and released. He was arrested on April 17 and booked as an accomplice to John Wilkes Booth. Within a month of the assassination eight individuals including Spangler had been apprehended and sat in a military courtroom charged with conspiring to \\"kill and murder\\" President Lincoln and the three above named high level government officials The crime was done, \\"maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously, and in aid of the existing armed rebellion against the United States of America\\".Steers (2113) pp. 18-19 The military trial began May 9 and lasted until June 30. Nine military officers were selected by the prosecution to serve on the commission. The officers served as both judge and jury. During the civil war since the officers of most military trials had no legal training the prosecutors were allowed in the deliberation room as legal advisers. A sense of the War department's attitude towards the defendants and the purpose of a military trial can be gleaned by the following three quotes. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles wrote in his diary the day the trial started, \\"The trial of the assassins is not so promptly carried into effect as (Secretary of War) Stanton declared it should be. He said it was his intention the criminals should be tried and executed before President Lincoln was buried\\".Diary Of Gideon Wells: Secretary Of The Navy Under Lincoln and Johnson, Volume II (1911) Houghton Mifflin Company. p. 303. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE8feoKPocQC&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false One of the commissioners, Brigadier General August V. Kautz wrote, \\"The Judge Advocates, under the influence of the Secretary of War, evidently, were very persevering and wanted evidently to have the seven [eight] prisoners all hung\\". Hatch, Frederick (2015). The Lincoln Assassination Conspiracy Trial And Its Legacy. McFarland & Company, Inc. pp.102-104. . During his closing argument for the prosecution, Assistant Judge Advocate John Bingham stated, > Who will dare to say in time of civil war \\"no person shall be deprived of > life, liberty, and property, without due process of law?\\" This is a > provision of your Constitution than which there is none more just or sacred > in it; it is, however, only the law of peace, not of war. In peace, that > wise provision of the Constitution must be, and is, enforced by civil > courts; in war, it must be, and is, to a great extent, inoperative and > disregarded\\".Steers (2013) p. 365 Along with the general charge of conspiracy each of the defendants were charged with the specific role they were accused of playing. Spangler was accused of aiding and assisting Booth into the President's box and then barring the door outside the box to prevent any help for Lincoln and then helping Booth escape.Steers (2013) pp. 19-20 After hearing all the trial testimony for the defendants General Lew Wallace, one of the commissioners, wrote a letter to his wife Susan dated June 26, 1865, in which he included the following comment. > The trial is not yet over but I say to myself, certainly it can't endure > beyond this week, and do all I can to be patient. Judge Bingham, on the side > of the government, speaks tomorrow, and the comm. votes \\"guilty or not > guilty\\". I have passed a few words with my associate members, and think we > can agree in a couple of hours at farthest. Three, if not four, of the eight > will be acquitted‚Äîthat is, they would be if we voted today. What effect > Bingham will have remains to be seen.The letter is currently held in the Lew > and Susan Wallace Collection at the Indiana Historical Society and is > available online as a digital image. Spangler was one of the three who the majority of the commissioners believed was not guilty. Three days later the commissioners in deliberation with the three prosecutors found Spangler not guilty of the general charge of conspiracy, not guilty of assisting Booth into the President's box and barring help, but guilty of helping Booth escape.Steers (2013) pp. 248-249 There was only one witness who testified that while pursuing Booth he saw someone at the door Booth escaped through from \\"about twenty or twenty-five feet\\" away.Steers 2013 p. 79 Major Joseph B. Stewart stated, \\"I do not undertake to swear positively that the prisoner, Edward Spangler, is the person I saw near the door; but I do say that there is no one among these prisoners who calls that man to my mind, except the man who, I am told, is Mr. Spangler; but I am decided in my opinion, that Spangler resembles the person I saw there\\".Steers 2013 p. 80 Stewart also testified, \\"The man I have spoken of stood about three feet from the door out of which Booth passed; I noticed him just after the door slammed.\\". Five days previously orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. testified, \\"Where I stood on the stage (at the time of Booth's escape) was not more than a yard from the door.\\". Jacob Ritterspaugh who worked backstage with Spangler as scene shifters testified that he unsuccessfully chased Booth and then added, \\"When I came back, Spangler was at the same place I had left him.\\".Steers 2013 p. 97 Four of the eight defendants, Mary Surratt, Lewis Payne, David Herold, and G. A. Atzerodt were sentenced to be hanged.Steers (2013) p. 249 Spangler, Dr. Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold and Michael O'Laughlen were sent to Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas off Key West, Florida.Steers (2013) pp. 249-250 In August 1867, there was an outbreak of yellow fever at Fort Jefferson. Dr. Mudd attempted to treat those who caught the disease while Spangler assisted. Michael O'Laughlen died of yellow fever in September 1867. When Dr. Mudd caught yellow fever, Spangler treated him. Spangler also built coffins for the thirty-seven prisoners and guards who eventually succumbed to the disease.Bogar 2013 p.256 Post prison years and death After years of petitions from Dr. Mudd's wife, Spangler's former boss John T. Ford and attorney Thomas Ewing, Jr., President Andrew Johnson pardoned Spangler, Dr. Mudd and Samuel Arnold on March 1, 1869. The group traveled back to Baltimore on a steamer, arriving on April 6. After arriving back home, Spangler went to work at the Holliday Street Theatre in Baltimore for his old boss John T. Ford, the former owner of Ford's Theatre where President Lincoln was shot. When the Holliday Street Theatre burned down in 1873, Spangler accepted an offer to live at Dr. Mudd's farm in Bryantown, Maryland (The two men had become friends in prison). Dr. and Mrs. Mudd gave him of land to farm. Spangler also performed carpentry chores in the neighborhood. In his final years, Spangler converted to Catholicism.Bogar 2013 p.257 In February 1875, Spangler became ill with a respiratory ailment, likely tuberculosis, after working in a winter rainstorm. He died on February 7, 1875. He was buried in a graveyard connected with St. Peter's Church which was about two miles (3 km) from Dr. Mudd's home in Charles County, Maryland. A grave marker was placed on his grave site in 1983. Statement Shortly after Spangler's death, Dr. Samuel Mudd found a handwritten statement in Spangler's tool chest presumably written by Spangler while he was in prison. In the statement, Spangler describes his relationship with John Wilkes Booth and denies having aided Booth in any manner whatsoever. Spangler's statement reads in part: > I was born in York County, Pennsylvania, and am about forty-three years of > age, I am a house carpenter by trade, and became acquainted with J.

I did not see Booth to speak to him, after the sale, until the > evening of the assassination. Upon the afternoon of April 14 I was told by > 'Peanut John' that the President and General Grant were coming to the > theater that night, and that I must take out the partition in the > President's box. It was my business to do all such work. I was assisted in > doing it by Rittespaugh and 'Peanut John.' In the evening, between five and > six o'clock, Booth came into the theater and asked me for a halter.

He afterward took the saddle off himself, > locked the stable, and went back to the theater. Booth, Maddox, 'Peanut > John,' and myself immediately went out of the theater to the adjoining > restaurant next door, and took a drink at Booth's expense.

Incident  The wedding united members of the Rakat and Sabah families: Ashad Rakat was the groom and Rutba, his bride. Witnesses report that the American bombing started at 3 am. Local accounts state that 42 people, including 11 women and 14 children, were killed during the incident. Among the known dead were Iraqi musicians Hussein al-Ali and his brother Mohaned al-Ali. Iraqi officials report 13 children were among the dead. 27 members of the extended Rakat family were killed. U.S. officials stated that the location was a \\"suspected foreign fighter safe house.\\"  Reaction  The U.S. military took the stance that the location was a legitimate target. Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, the coalition deputy chief of staff for U.S. operations in Iraq: \\"We took ground fire and we returned fire. We estimate that around 40 were killed. But we operated within our rules of engagement.\\" U.S. fire included both bullets and bombs, leaving behind craters.AP, Iraq Wedding-Party Video Backs Survivors' Claims,\\" 24 May 2004 In the aftermath, Kimmitt said, \\"There was no evidence of a wedding: no decorations, no musical instruments found, no large quantities of food or leftover servings one would expect from a wedding celebration. There may have been some kind of celebration. Bad people have celebrations, too.\\" USMC Major General James Mattis asserted that even the idea of a wedding was implausible, \\"How many people go to the middle of the desert ... to hold a wedding 80 miles (130km) from the nearest civilization? These were more than two dozen military-age males. Let's not be naive.\\" The Rakats and the Sabahs were residents of Mukaradeeb. Mattis later added that it had taken him 30 seconds to deliberate on bombing the location., p. 245 Video footage obtained by the Associated Press contradicts this. The video shows a series of scenes of a wedding celebration, and footage from the following day shows fragments of musical instruments, pots and pans and brightly colored beddings used for celebrations, scattered around a destroyed tent. Despite evidence against U.S. military, its generals refused to apologize for the actions.

An average of 13,000 adults attend each weekend at the church's five campus locations: Tyson's Corner (which is the largest campus), Arlington County, Loudoun County, Prince William County and Montgomery County, Maryland. David Platt, former president of the International Missions Board, is the Lead Pastor- succeeding Lon Solomon in 2017. History =Founding= McLean Bible Church was founded in 1961 by five families in Northern Virginia. Its first service was held on Easter Sunday at Chesterbook Elementary School in McLean with Pastor J. Albert Ford. =Pastor Lon Solomon= Senior Pastor Lon Solomon was born and raised in a Jewish home in Portsmouth, Virginia, before converting to Christianity in the spring of 1971. He graduated from the University of North Carolina with a B.S. in Chemistry (1971). He then completed a Th.M. degree in Hebrew and Old Testament at Capital Bible Seminary (1975, summa cum laude) in Lanham, Maryland. He completed graduate work at Johns Hopkins University, receiving a master's degree in Near Eastern Studies in 1979. Solomon taught Hebrew and Old Testament at Capital Bible Seminary from 1975 to 1980. In 1980, he became the senior pastor at McLean Bible Church. Solomon has been on the board of Jews for Jesus since 1987, where he now serves as chairman of the board's executive committee. In September 2002, Solomon was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve in his administration as a member of the President's Committee on Intellectual Disabilities. He received a Doctorate of Divinity degree from Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary in 2005. Solomon is the author of the books Brokenness: How God Redeems Pain and Suffering and The 23rd Psalm for the 21st Century. In December 2017, Lon Solomon started his own ministry, Lon Solomon Ministries. = Pastor David Platt= In September 2017, David Platt was confirmed as the Pastor-Teacher, later \\"Lead Pastor\\", replacing Lon Solomon. That same year McLean Bible Church started cooperating in some aspects with the Southern Baptist Convention in areas of missions and church planting, but is not officially considered a \\"Southern Baptist Church.\\" Under the leadership of Platt, McLean has also been the broadcast location for several Radical (David Platt's resource ministry) simulcasts. On June 2, 2019, McLean made national headlines when President Donald Trump made an unplanned visit. After playing golf nearby, President Trump appeared on-stage at the Tyson's Corner campus after communion where Pastor Platt prayed for him.

The system was invented by the Slovene linguist Anton Bezen≈°ek c. 1879. It is based on the Gabelsberger shorthand (used for German), so it is often referred to as the Gabelsberger-Bezen≈°ek Shorthand. (More precisely, Bezen≈°ek Shorthand is based on a system by Heger -- one of Gabelsberger's students, who adapted the system for the Czech language.)  Overview  The letters from the Cyrillic script, as written when isolated. Bezen≈°ek Shorthand has features of a phonetic system, though Bulgarian writing almost identically represents the sounds in speech. It is acceptable to replace certain closely related sounds with each other, for the sake of simplicity and speed, e. g. s for z, e for ya, svo for stvo, etc. The system is not an alphabetic one, but closer to a syllabic one, though many syllables are normally skipped. Vowels are usually not recorded as separate strokes, but are marked via modifying the preceding or following consonant, similarly to an abugida. The shorthand's form is based on borrowings from natural longhand, as opposed to geometric or elliptical systems, such as Gregg and Pitman. The strokes are distinguishable by size, proportion, position (three of them: above, below, or on the base line), and shading (variation of thickness of strokes). Shading, normally used for marking an /a/ vowel, is nowadays difficult to achieve with a ballpoint pen, but at the time of invention was convenient for marking, using the then- ubiquitous pencils. Nevertheless, ambiguity is close to none, even when thickness is not marked, because words are easily recognizable from the context. Several letters can be written in two different ways: * The pairs of strokes for –ï–µ , –§—Ñ , and –¢—Ç can be used interchangeably. * The first stroke for –ó–∑ , –¶—Ü , and –£—É is used only in the beginning of a word. * The second stroke for –í–≤ and –®—à can be used only in the end of a word. * Both stroke for –ê–∞ can be used for an isolated (possibly an abbreviation) , but only the second sign is used as part of a word. Note, that /a/ is normally marked by shading of the preceding consonant. * One of connecting lines of –ê–∞ or –õ–ª may be omitted when part of a word. –ô–π and –¨—å represent the same sound , so they share the same stroke. Phrasing: even, more, even more, (even) more and more. –°–∏–≥–ª–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—É–≤–∞–Ω–µ: (–≤)—Å–µ, –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ, –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ, –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ –∏ –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ. The system has a set of compulsory abbreviations, called sigli (; singular: , sigla), and recommends rules for forming free abbreviations. Punctuation consists only of a period, written as a small horizontal segment on the base line, because the dot, comma, question mark, exclamation mark, and others, have special meaning and could be confused with words. Colons and double quotes are acceptable, especially for beginners. Digits are similar to the Arabic numerals, except for 5 and 7, which can be written without a horizontal bar; also, special notation is normally applied for hundreds, thousands, and millions. Abbreviation of whole phrases into a single connected sequence of strokes is allowed and encouraged.  History  In 1878 Bulgaria was liberated from a five-century Ottoman rule, and a government was formed. Initially, discussions in Parliament were recorded by conventional scribes, and arguments about the accuracy of records were not uncommon. Slovenian linguist Bezen≈°ek, who had already had experience with adapting shorthand to other Slavic languages, was invited. He accepted and came up with a solution, although he was not a proficient speaker of Bulgarian at first. As the system developed, it required corrections, which Bezen≈°ek coped with well. In the following decades, however, improvements were more and more difficult to make, hindered by new teachers who had already published books, that were then expensive to re- print. Most of those book authors had ideas about improvements of their own, but only a few could manage to gain control of the \\"official\\" version. The system became quite conservative, a lot of suggestions were rejected, including some proposed by Bezen≈°ek himself. Some suggestions were rejected without even being taken into consideration. The existing system was announced unique, official, compulsory, and \\"best in the world\\". Competition was banned -- a participant in a shorthand competition was once disqualified for using an alternative system. Shortly after the Communist party took power in 1944, all existing shorthand organizations were dismissed, and the National Shorthand Institute was established. It kept on resisting reforms until the 1960s, when a contest was held. At first no propositions were accepted, which caused a scandal, so after re-examination four of them were approved. Unfortunately it was reported to the Minister of Education, that the new speed results were worse than before, so the old system once again survived. Another fruitless contest was held in the 1980s. As a result, the 1923 version of Bezen≈°ek- Gabelsberger remained official until the National Shorthand Institute was shut down in Democratic Bulgaria. Presently, newer systems are taught at universities, but are not regulated and none of them is a monopoly.  Criticism  * Shading is difficult to express with a ballpoint pen. This also reduces readability for learners. * Positioning might lead to ambiguity, as the same sign can often mean different things when put at different positions. * Steep learning curve -- the great number of consonantal blends and abbreviations (\\"sigli\\") require quite some time for a beginner to start using the system effectively. * Suitability for Bulgarian is disputed, as the system was created for the unrelated German language, and Bezen≈°ek had become fluent in Bulgarian just shortly before he invented it. To a certain extent, this resulted in some waste of elegant natural strokes for infrequent sounds, and a redundancy of complex slow strokes for common sounds. Neither does the system fit well with the increasing number of loanwords from English.

She is also the first and only Thai artist to have their first four studio albums sell over 1 million copies; her third album Red Beat is the best selling female artist's album of all time in Thai music industry, selling 3 million copies. Her eight solo albums have sold over 10.5 million copies (not including special albums). She is of Filipino, French, Spanish and Vietnamese descent. Biography =1966‚Äì90: Early life = Christina Aguilar is the daughter of Spanish-Filipino musician, Tony Aguilar, and Franco-Vietnamese mother, Margaret. Christina was born in Bangkok, Thailand. She has two siblings, Anthony and Theresa.www.christinaaguilar.com Her father was one of her most important music influences and she and her family often sang together. Aguilar studied at the French Institute, pursuing a bachelor in business management studies in France. She does not have Thai heritage, but sometimes is mistaken for Thai because of her fair skin and ability to speak fluent Thai. In addition to Thai, Aguilar speaks French, English, and some Spanish. She first became known for her singing abilities while in France. During her college's annual party, she was asked by her friends to perform on stage; she sang \\"Sweet Memory\\". When she graduated, she was recruited by a French advertising agency where she worked as an assistant account executive. She then returned to Thailand and briefly worked in a travel agency. The turning point in her career was when she met Rewat Bhuddhinan, then chief producer for GMM Grammy, who enticed her into the music industry. =1990‚Äì94: Early Success with Ninja and Arwut Lab (Secret Weapons)= Aguilar first appeared on radio in 1990. Her debut single \\"Ninja\\", taken from the album of the same name, became a hit among Thai listeners. It was followed by the release of some other pop dance singles, including \\"Plik Lock \\" and \\"Prawatsart \\", and some ballads, like \\"Hua Jai Kor Ma \\" and \\"Plao Rok Na \\". Aguilar broke records by being the first female artist with a million-seller album in Thailand. Arwut Lab (Secret Weapons) was released in 1992. The video of the album's lead single, \\"Jing Mai Klua \\", won MTV Asian Viewers Choice Award in Los Angeles, USA. It was the second music video by a Thai artist to win this award after Thongchai McIntyre. In the album's second video, \\"Wela Mai Chuai Arai \\", Aguilar costarred with a Chinese-American actor Michael Wong. The album has sold over a million copies, like its predecessor. =1994‚Äì99: Red Beat= Aguilar performing in Chiang Mai in 1999. In 1994, Aguilar released her third album \\"Red Beat\\". With a faster beat and a modern and sexy appearance, it became her most successful album to date, containing two of her most successful singles. One is the dance single \\"Mai Yag Rok \\" and the other is the love ballad \\"Rak Thur Thee Sood \\". This was the third time that an Aguilar album sold more than one million copies. The album eventually reached the mark of three million copies sold, being the only female album to do so in Thailand. This album also became the third biggest-selling album of all time in Thai music history, only behind two albums of Thongchai McIntyre. A year later, she was one of five guests of Thailand's most successful singer, Thongchai McIntyre, in the album Khon Nok Gub Dok Mai (Feather and Flowers). She sang with Thongchai in Asanee-Wasan' s Rak Thur Samur (‡∏£‡∏±‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ò‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏°‡∏≠). In the same year, with other five popular Thai artists at that time, Jetrin Wattanasin, Patipan Pataweekarn, Tata Young, UHT, and Myria Benedetti, she was included on the album 6-2-12. Both albums sold over a million copies. Golden Eye was released three years later. She came back with a more grown up and mature image. She co-wrote a song named \\"Tai Pa Hom Oun \\" for this album. The album spawned hits such as \\"Ya Mong Trong Nan \\", \\"Fak Kwam Yin Dee \\", \\"Mai Tong Khob Jai \\", \\"Tai Pa Hom Oun \\" and the gay anthem \\"Pood Eek Thee \\".women.impaqmsn.com/giggajib Moreover, Golden Eye contains Thai-French lyrics in the song \\"Bai Mai \\", written by Aguilar. The album was still popular, although it was less successful than her previous efforts; it still sold, however, a million copies like its predecessors. =1999‚Äì2002: 5th Avenue, English-language debut and Dancing Queen= In 1999, Aguilar explored a younger and more colorful image with her fifth album 5th Avenue. It spawned the hit single \\"Oon Jai \\". It has been sold almost a million copies. In the same year, Aguilar released her first English-language album. The album features Sarah Jane Fearnley (also known as Fearn), an English singer who sang backup for Spice Girls and on the soundtrack of the movie Evita. This album consists of re-arranged songs in English. However, it was not as successful overseas as her second studio album. Her sixth album Dancing Queen was released in 2001. It was met with moderate reception. It was the first time Aguilar released a slow ballad as a lead single instead of uptempo one. However, \\"Kid Pid Kid Mai \\", has managed to top several radio charts. Due to heavy piracy situation during that time, the album became her smallest-selling album since her debut, selling approximately 670,000 copies. =2003‚Äì07: Paradise and C.Space= In 2003, Aguilar released her seventh album, Paradise. The album contained Latin sound. It spawned three singles: \\"Sawan Yoo Thee Jai \\", \\"Hong Derm \\", and \\"Yak Fung Kum Nun Talod Pai \\". Paradise received well receptions, being sold over 760,000 copies. Four years later, Aguilar released her eighth album C.Space, featuring singles \\"Koh Khoom Laew\\", \\"An Everlasting Love\\", and \\"Wang Meed Dai Rue Yung\\". This was during an important change in Thai music industry when no cassette was released anymore. =2008‚Äìpresent: Live performances and concerts= Aguilar in 2009. Aguilar has not released any studio albums since C.Space. She has mainly focused on live performances and concerts. In late 2008, she started working on a project, Mai ‚Äì Tina: Beauty on the Beat, collaborating with Mai Charoenpura. The new single \\"Burn\\" was produced and the concert was due on June 6, 2009. In 2010, Aguilar performed with various artists, including Tata Young, Mai Charoenpura, Marsha, Jetrin Wattanasin, and Dan, on a special project called \\"This is It, the Concert\\", a tribute to Michael Jackson, after his death in 2009. It took place on February 21 and 22, 2010 at the Impact Arena in Bangkok. Aguilar celebrated her 20th career anniversary on December 21, 2010. She held celebratory concerts on June 4 and 5, 2011 at the Royal Paragon Halls. She has performed in several recurrent concerts of her previous projects, including \\"6.2.13\\" and \\"Kon Nok Kab Dok Mai: The Original Return\\".

The colour of the iron rich gneiss (metamorphique) mountains gives the range its name. The highest summit is the Aiguille du Belv√©d√®re at . At the southern end of the range, Le Br√©vent at is accessible by a cable car in the Planpraz and the Br√©vent sections.  Morphology  Unlike the massif of the Mont Blanc, the Aiguilles Rouges have no significant glaciers. The alpine stage begins around with rough boulders, above which a series of broken needles spring from the Col des Montets to Le Br√©vent. The northwestern side of the massif has less vegetation because of its lack of exposure to the sun. The southwest face abounds in vegetation which developed from a multitude of biotopes. Amongst the typical flora hikers can discover include sundews, martagons and many varieties of orchids. In order to protect this biodiversity, the Aiguilles Rouges National Nature Reserve (R√©serve naturelle des aiguilles rouges) was created in 1974 covering 3,279 ha. The Aiguilles Rouges offer a splendid view of all the peaks of Chamonix, the glaciers of Mont Blanc, and the roof of Europe. The French artist Samivel is known for his paintings of some of these splendid views. The highest point in this range is named Belv√©d√®re (literally \\"beautiful viewpoint\\" in French) because it offers a 360¬∞ panoramic view of all the mountains surrounding the Aiguilles Rouges. The mountain path running from Planpraz to the Col des Montets via La Fl√©g√®re, just above the treeline of the Aiguilles Rouges, is called Le Grand Balcon Sud (Grand Southern Balcony). The eastern part of the range has numerous mountain lakes, of which the most remarkable is Lac Blanc at the foot of the Aiguille Belv√©d√®re.

It is one of Kerry's most popular tourist destinations due to its scenery.  Naming  Looking northwards from the stone bridge above Augher Lake below The term Dunloe is believed to be an anglicization of the Irish term \\"D√∫n L√≥ich\\", meaning fort or stronghold of L√≥ich (the River Loe that runs through the Gap of Dunloe valley also derives its name from the same source). According to the Annals of Clonmacnois, Keating and the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (LGE), Deala (or Dela) Mac L√≥ich was the father of the five chieftains of the returning Fir Bolg (Slainghe, Gann, Genann, Seangann, and Rudhraighe), who conquered Ireland and divided it into five provinces, each ruled by one brother. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the Fir Bolg ruled Ireland for 37 years from 3266 to 3303 B.C., but were themselves defeated by the returning Tuatha D√© Danann.Koch, John T.. Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2006. pp.749-750  Geography  Looking northwards to the stone bridge before Black Lough The Gap of Dunloe was formed 25,000 years ago during Ireland's last ice age as a result of a \\"glacial breach\\" where a glacier in the Black Valley, part of the Templenoe Icecap, estimated to be over 500 metres deep, broke through the Head of the Gap and moved northwards carving out a U-shaped valley. The pass runs north-south between the Old Red Sandstone mountain ranges of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks (to the west) and the Purple Mountain Group (to the east). The north-south road through The Gap as the area is also known, goes from Kate Kearney's Cottage in the north, to the highest point at the Head of the Gap at , and down to Lord Brandon's Cottage in the Black Valley in the south. The road from Kate Kearney's Cottage to Lord Brandon's Cottage is in length, with in total elevation change. Within The Gap are five lakes (from north to south): Coosaun Lough, Black Lake, Cushnavally Lake, Auger Lake, and Black Lough. The lakes are connected by the River Loe. Between the first two, Coosaun Lough and Black Lake is the Wishing Bridge on which it is said that wishes made while upon it are destined to come true. The stone bridge at the northern end of Augher Lake and the stone bridge at the northern end of Black Lough are also lookout points. Access Sign erected by private jaunting car operators to mimic an official sign to dissuade tourists driving The Gap. The road through the Gap of Dunloe, from Kate Kearney's Cottage in the north, into the Black Valley in the south, is a public road, and under the charge of Kerry County Council. Private jaunting car operators based at Kate Kearney's Cottage have been accused of erecting signs that imply the road is closed to cars. In 2018, the Lonely Planet guide had to clarify the road is public in its 2018 Ireland guidebook. Kate Kearney's Cottage The true Head of the Gap (at ), can be accessed from the north by driving past Kate Kearney's Cottage, and from the south by driving to Moll's Gap and then continuing east on the R568 road until a small side-road (at , sometimes labelled \\"Gearhasallagh\\" after the townsland, on maps), descends steeply north into the Black Valley and then winds its way westwards towards Lord Brandon's Cottage (which is off-route), but then diverts north to the actual Head of the Gap; this route is part of a 55‚Äìkilometre loop of the Killarney‚ÄìGap of Dunloe‚ÄìBlack Valley‚ÄìMoll's Gap area, popular with cyclists. As the public road through the Gap of Dunloe road reaches the Head of the Gap it becomes narrow and winding and is difficult for vehicles to pass, which has led to concerns over safety; there have been fatalities over the years of cyclists. There have also been fatalities of tourists in jaunting cars. Climbing and walking =Hill walking= The mountain ranges on either side of The Gap (MacGillycuddy's Reeks to the west, and Purple Mountain Group to the east), are common hill walking routes (some routes are discussed in more detail in their respective articles). The walk from Kate Kearney's Cottage (at ), to the full Head of the Gap (at ) is 6 kilometres and takes circa 1 hour (and another hour for the return journey back to Kate Kearney's Cottage). =Rock climbing= Rock climbing on Both√°n with Augher Lake in the background. While not as well known as other Irish rock climbing locations (like Ailladie, Fair Head or Dalkey Quarry), various Old Red Sandstone cliffs and crags along the Gap of Dunloe are used as locations for rock climbing, and over 107 routes are listed and graded in the Irish Climbing Online Wiki. There are only two crags on the east side of the valley, namely C√©im and Both√°n, with most of the crags being in the north-west side of the valley, near Brennan's Leap (the cliff at the western shore of Coosaun Lough) / the Wishing Bridge (the stone bridge between Coosaun Lough and Black Lake). Grades range from V‚ÄìDiff to E5 6b (Far Away Friends 10 m E5 6b, Cub Crag), with The Main Face crag having some of the longest +30 metre higher E‚Äìgrade climbs (including Demasiado 40 m E1 5b, 5a), and Jigzaw Wall having short but also some of the hardest climbs in the valley. The Gap was ranked as one of the \\"top 5 areas\\" for bouldering in Ireland, including The Main Face crag, with grades of up to 7b.

These taxonomies have been adapted to cope with the changes in UK industry, The 1980 system was far more detailed in manufacturing, while the 2007 system is much stronger in the IT sector. Many companies still use the 2003 codes which were the 1992 system updated slightly. However, the very latest version is the 2007 SIC system History A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the United Kingdom in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data and its use promotes uniformity. In addition, it can be used for administration purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure. Current 2007 SIC codes These now fall in line with the European Union industrial classification system, NACE, and the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classifications, ISIC, to and including the 4 digit class level. For certain classes in the UK SIC 2007 taxonomy a further breakdown to a 5 digit level is available.

The Encyclopedia of American Religions described it as a significant periodical. First version, 1968‚Äì1976 Green Egg was created by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, who was the editor from 1968 to 1974. It started as a one-page ditto sheet. It continued under another editor for two more years, by which point it had grown over 80 issues into a 60-page journal. According to J. Gordon Melton in the Encyclopedia of American Religions, it became \\"the most significant periodical in the Pagan movement during the 1970s and made Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, its editor, a major force in Neo-Paganism\\". It became dormant in 1976. Margot Adler's sociological study Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today was first published in 1979, shortly after the first incarnation of Green Egg ceased. (Adler's work was revised and updated in 1986, 1996, and 2006.) Adler used Green Egg as one of the main ways of distributing her survey, and received hundreds of responses from its readers. Drawing Down the Moon repeatedly refers to Green Egg as formative in modern American Paganism. \\"It took a catalyst to create a sense of collectivity around the word Pagan, and in the United States the Church of All Worlds and its Green Egg filled this role.\\" The magazine created a communication network (in pre-internet days) among the many earth religions that were coming into being. Adler was impressed by the \\"free-ranging and diverse\\" views found in its pages, commenting that, \\"There was less common ground assumed in Green Egg than in any other publication I had ever seen.\\" It was highly synergistic, bringing together hundreds of groups and ideas for debate in print, covering subjects relating to \\"ecology, ethics, tribalism, magic, science fiction, and the relationship of human beings to the planet\\". Adler reports that some Pagans told her in the late 1970s that they were glad of its demise, because there would be less bickering between various factions. She, however, judged it \\"key to the movement's vitality\\". Later versions, 1988 onwards Rosemary Ellen Guiley states in The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca that it was Zell's two wives, Morning Glory Zell and Diane Darling, who revived Green Egg at Beltane 1988. Morning Glory is credited with coining the term \\"polyamory\\", in an essay in Green Egg entitled \\"A Bouquet of Lovers\\". Once more it took its place as \\"a leading Pagan journal\\", according to Adler. Eventually Darling left, Zell-Ravenheart was ousted, and the magazine‚Äîthriving until 2001‚Äîfolded again. In March 2007, Green Egg was restarted as an ezine, available online at greeneggemagazine.com. In 2008, an anthology of art and articles was published, entitled Green Egg Omelette. In 2013, Green Egg announced a print on demand service, and was digitising its back catalog. Oberon (formerly Otter) and Morning Glory Zell were the subjects of the book The Wizard and the Witch: Seven Decades of Counterculture, Magick & Paganism (2014), which includes a fuller story of Green Egg and the Church of All Worlds. In January 2015, Monserrat and Donohue retired. In spring 2020, Church of All Worlds resume online publication of Green Egg Magazine under the direction of Rev. Alder Moonoak.

He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy and began his studies there on November 21, 1859. One of several whose academy careers were foreshortened by the war, he served on the sloop , the garrison ship Island and the gunboat in the Gulf Blockading Squadrons, including two attacks on and passage of the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg in 1861 and 1862. In late December 1861, Woodward was part of the prize-crew of the captured Confederate steamer Henry Lewis, off Ship Island, Mississippi, when he commanded one of two small boat that went ashore and captured a Confederate battery, \\"which was done as expeditiously as possible and without molestation.\\"Lieutenant Thomas Mc.

He then served on the sloop in the Pacific Squadron in 1863, and participated in the capture of the Rebel privateer J. M. Chapman on March 15, in San Francisco harbor. Woodward apparently spent little time at sea during this tour, as Cyane was in port at San Francisco from February 15 to September 28.Peck, p.695 Promoted to Lieutenant in February 1864, he was assigned to the steam frigate in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In the assault on Fort Fisher on January 14, 1865, Lieutenant Woodward commanded a company of 49 men from the Minnesota, and \\"behaved bravely,\\" and his conduct was represented as having been \\"highly commendable\\" by Commodore Joseph Lanman, commanding Second Division, North Atlantic Squadron.

Kearsarge had been decommissioned in November 1864 after her famous battle with the Confederate raider off the coast of France the previous June. She recommissioned April 1, 1865, and sailed on the 14th for the coast of Spain in an attempt to intercept ; but the Confederate ram eluded Federal ships and surrendered to Spanish authorities at Havana, Cuba, on May 19. After cruising the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel south to Monrovia, Liberia, Kearsarge decommissioned August 14, 1866 in the Boston Navy Yard. Woodward married, on August 9, 1866, Mary Elizabeth Hawley, daughter of Rev. Bostwick and Elizabeth (Webber) Hawley. According to the 1910 census, Mary had four children, none of whom were still living at that time, but the 1880 census, when Edwin and Mary were enumerated with her father in Saratoga Springs, New York, did not list any children.http://www.familysearch.org and www.ancestry.com Woodward was also promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1866. In 1867 and 1868, Woodward served on , a screw sloop recommissioned on May 21, 1867, which sailed from New York Harbor on June 28, 1867, to serve as flagship of the South Atlantic Squadron protecting American commerce and interests along the coast of South America.\\" In 1869, Woodward served on board the newly built gunboat and the Civil War- era gunboat , along the Atlantic coast of South America and the western coast of Africa, probably returning to Washington on September 15, 1869, when the Kansas was decommissioned. He was assigned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 1869 to 1871, reassigned to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and probably commanded pre-commissioning crews for the Civil War-era single-turreted monitors and . Canonicus was recommissioned January 22, 1872, and cruised in coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Saugus was recommissioned November 9, 1872, sailed south, and was based at Key West, Florida, until 1876. In 1874 and 1875, Woodward served on the Civil War-era screw sloop , which was reactivated January 20, 1874, and operated \\"along the southern coast of the United States until autumn when she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to be fitted out for service as flagship of the South Atlantic Squadron. She got underway for the coast of Brazil on January 23, 1875, and operated in South American waters protecting American interests until heading home on December 7. Following service in the Home Squadron, she was decommissioned at New York City on July 21, 1876, and laid up.\\" In 1876, Woodward served on the screw sloop . Newly commissioned on January 10, 1876, Vandalia \\"was soon deployed with the European Squadron and spent most of the next three years cruising in the Mediterranean Sea along the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey.\\" Woodward was ordered to torpedo duty in 1877, was promoted to commander in February 1878. He was stationed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 1879 to 1880. He was probably on leave in 1880, when he was listed in the New York Census, living with his wife and father-in-law, Bostwick Hawley, in Saratoga Springs, New York.Woodward, age 37, born VT, is listed as commander in US Navy; wife Mary H., age 36, born NY.

In June, at Progreso, Yucat√°n, she investigated the detention of the American bark Acacia before returning northward to familiar waters off the eastern seaboard of the United States.\\" Woodward received the thanks of the State Department, probably in relation to the Acacia incident. In October 1881, Yantic also took part in observances commemorating the centennial of the Battle of Groton Heights and in festivities celebrating the centennial of the American victory at Yorktown, Virginia.\\" In 1884, Woodward is supposed to have commanded a squadron of ironclads, including the , and , but the ships' histories do not appear to support such a squadron. Passaic was a Civil War-era coastal monitor stationed at the Naval Academy, Annapolis, from 1883 to 1892. Nantucket was also a Civil War-era coastal monitor, briefly recommissioned between June and October 1884; it operated along the northern east coast. Alarm was an experimental torpedo boat which conducted research duties at New York in 1884 and served there until she was placed out of commission in 1885 and berthed at New York. This time frame bears more research. Whatever he did, Woodward received a commendatory letter from the Secretary of the Navy for his activities. Woodward commanded , a screw sloop, from 1885 and 1886. The highlight of Swataras activities during his command was the transport of a cargo of gold bullion from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Washington, D.C., in September 1885. \\"In early 1886, she was assigned hydrographic duties fixing locations on the Puerto Rican coast. After subsequently cruising as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia, Swatara arrived at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where she was decommissioned on October 27, 1886,\\" and Woodward relinquished command. In 1888, Woodward was in temporary command of , a monitor under construction at the New York Navy Yard. Woodward spent his last two years at sea in command of the screw steamer . Originally commissioned in 1876, Adams had spent several years in the Pacific before returning to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a brief period of repairs in early 1889. On April 22, 1889, Commander Woodward in command, \\"Adams took on stores and supplies before departing San Francisco on June 18. She arrived at Honolulu on Independence Day 1889 and remained there for a month.\\" \\"The duration of her stay in Hawaii resulted from the maturation of a plot to dethrone King KalƒÅkaua and dissolve the reform government installed by American business and missionary interests as a result of the \\"Bloodless Revolution of 1887\\" that had been carried out in the course of Adams previous extended sojourn in the islands. During the night of 29 and July 30, insurgents occupied the palace grounds and a local militia unit, styled the Honolulu Rifles, took up positions in support of the government. By the evening of the 30th, the Honolulu Rifles had subdued the insurrection.\\" At that point, Woodward sent a landing party from the ship which established itself in the vicinity of the American legation. But the Hawaiian government restored order quickly without the necessity of American intervention, and the landing party returned to ship the following morning. On August 4, 1889, Adams departed Honolulu and sailed a course south to Samoa, arriving at Apia harbor, Samoa on August 20. For the next nine months, she remained in those islands serving as American station ship there making periodic visits to various islands. On May 2, 1890, Adams set sail from Pago Pago bound via Hawaii for the west coast of the United States. She entered San Francisco Bay on June 24 and moored at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on the 25th. There she was placed out of commission, in ordinary, on July 31, 1890. In 1892 he was assigned as Light House Inspector in the 10th Light House District, which comprised 114 miles of the St. Lawrence River as well as Lake Ontario, Lake Erie and the Niagara River. Of note, he relieved Commander Charles Vernon Gridley, who would later command , Commodore George Dewey's flagship, during the attack on Manila at the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During his tenure, Woodward, on behalf of the United States Government, presented a life-saving medal second class to Miss Maebelle L. Mason, at the 'Cadillac Hotel,' Detroit, during the National Convention of the Grand Army of the Republic. Mason had rowed more than a mile in a small flat-bottomed punt, from the Mamajuda lighthouse on the Detroit river, where she lived with her father, and rescued a man who had capsized in his row-boat.

The predominant occupation of the Igbide is fishing and farming especially of cassava and groundnuts. The fishing is done mainly in the Urie lake, Owodokpokpo. In the first week of February the clan holds a festival on the Urie marking the start of the fishing season. Cultivation, mainly of cassava and groundnuts, is also undertaken by the Igbide. While popular folklore has it that the Igbide people originated from Mgbidi in the Eastern (Igbo) part of Nigeria, some more recent writers attribute their origins to Awka in present day Anambra state with a blend of later immigrants from Uvwie (Effurun) in Delta State . This affiliation to the Igbos can be observed in the dress and costume codes of the Igbides in festivals like ABAME., and the salutation sequence and chants as well as the mercantile nature of a typical Igbide man.

A point-of-sale display (POS display) is a specialized form of sales promotion that is found near, on, or next to a checkout counter (the \\"point of sale\\"). They are intended to draw the customers' attention to products, which may be new products, or on special offer, and are also used to promote special events, e.g. seasonal or holiday-time sales. POS displays can include free standing display units (FSDU), shelf edging, dummy packs, strut cards, standees, hanging signs, counter display units (CDU), display packs, endcaps, display stands, mobiles, posters, and banners.Point of Sale Displays, Cestrian (accessed 26 November 2018) POS can also refer to systems used to record transactions between the customer and the commerce.Point of Sale (POS) System, Entrepreneur (accessed 26 November 2018) Friday, 13 September 2019 Examples Usually, in smaller retail outlets, POS displays are supplied by the manufacturer of the products, and also sited, restocked and maintained by one of their regular salespersons. However, this is less common in large supermarkets as they can control the activities of their suppliers due to their large purchasing power, and prefer to use their own material designed to be consistent with their corporate theming and store layout. Common items that may appear in POS displays year-round are batteries, soft drinks, candy, chewing gum, magazines, comics, tobacco, and writable CDs and DVDs. These displays are also useful in outlets with limited floor space, as there tends to be much wasted space around counters. The displays are normally covered with branding for the product they are trying to sell, and are made out of cardboard or foamboard, and/or a covering over a plastic or Perspex/Plexiglass stand, all intended to be easily replaceable and disposable. This allows designers to make full use of color and printing to make the display visually appealing. Some displays are fixed or non-disposable; these may include lighting to make the display more visible and may also contain a cooler, e.g. for drinks or ice cream. Some are no more than a metal basket, with no design on the outside, simply showing a price; these types of display are easier to refill.Point-of-Purchase Promotions - Consumer Sales Promotion Methods, Boundless (accessed 17 November 2013) =Lightboxes= In the field of POS displays, a \\"lightbox\\" is a display fixture (or a modular component of a larger POS display structure) that contains a translucent graphic film with lamps that transmit light through the graphic, thus \\"backlighting\\" the graphic message for increased visibility, brightness and contrast relative to its surroundings. By definition, the artwork or backlit graphic film (aka \\"duratrans\\") in a POS lightbox is replaceable without discarding the lightbox or any of its other components. Lightboxes have historically been lighted with fluorescent lamps due to their (a) cooler operating temperature than incandescent; (b) relatively efficient power consumption; and (c) inherent diffusive property. However, as in most commercial lighting applications, there has been a significant industry-wide shift in the late 20th and early 21st century toward LED lamps in POS lightboxes, for not just the universally- acknowledged benefit of economy but also of practicality, as LED lamps are more durable and impact-resistant in shipping, handling and public applications such as Point-of-Sale. Motion LED lightboxes are a variation on traditional lightboxes, and use programmed LEDs behind a display to create the impression of movement. Note: the definition of \\"lightbox\\" as it relates to POS displays is similar to but distinct from that of a lightbox in the Photography and Graphic Arts industries. The similarity is that they both contain lamps whose light is diffused to uniformly backlight a translucent image; the distinction is that a POS lightbox is a permanent or semi-permanent fixture used to display an advertising message in a retail space, while a photography lightbox is usually a portable or table-mounted appliance used for image quality analysis and/or tracing in a photography studio, graphic design studio, graphic/print production shop or similar environment. =Free Standing Display Units (FSDU)= Free standing display units are designed to attract the attention of customers and promote key retail products or messages. They are often placed strategically within the customer journey, and utilise bright colours and graphics to stand out visually and encourage shoppers to buy. FSDUs are generally made from cardboard. This reduces production costs, and makes them easy to transport and assemble, at the same time as being robust enough for use in a busy retail environment.

Healy (born August 1943) is an American city manager who was the longest-serving city manager in the history of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served from July 1, 1981 until June 30, 2013. Prior to assuming his current position, Healy initially served as acting city manager from July 1, 1981 to December 14, 1981. He also served as acting City Manager of Lowell, Massachusetts in 1974. Early life Healy was born in the North Cambridge neighborhood of Cambridge. During his youth his family moved to Billerica, Massachusetts. He attended the Catholic Keith Academy in Lowell and earned a bachelor's degree in English from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1965. After graduating he taught English and coached football and hockey at Tewksbury Memorial High School. In 1969, Healy left teaching to become a probation officer at the Lowell District Court. Early government career In 1970, Healy was hired by Lowell Mayor Richard P. Howe to run his city hall office. That same year he earned his master's degree in educational administration from Lowell State College. Later that year he was named assistant city manager by city manager James Sullivan. When Sullivan departed Lowell for Cambridge in 1974, Healy served as acting city manager for one month. State Representative Paul Sheehy was chosen over Healy for the permanent job by the Lowell City Council after 53 ballots. After being passed over, Healy followed Sullivan to Cambridge to be deputy city manager. After Sheehy was fired in 1975, Healy applied for the job again. He was a finalist alongside William Taupier and Armand Mercier. Taupier was selected after sixteen ballots. Cambridge city manager On May 18, 1981, Sullivan announced that he was resigning effective July 1 to become President of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. Healy was Sullivan's preferred successor and on June 8 the city council voted 8 to 1 to name him acting city manager upon Sullivan's departure. On December 14, 1981, Healy was named permanent manager. Healy retired as City Manager on June 30, 2013. = Criticism = In recent history, the media has highlighted the salary of the City Manager as being one of the highest in the State of Massachusetts. The salary is higher than that of the Mayor of the City of Boston, some opinion editorials claim his salary is double that of the Governor of Massachusetts, or in some instances, almost that of the President of the United States. In February 2011, City Councillor Leland Cheung pushed a policy order that would call for greater transparency in city council contracts for the Office of the City Manager's salary. Healy fought a controversial 13-year legal battle against charges of racial discrimination. In 1998, four city employees filed charges of racial discrimination. After two trials and repeated appeals, the City was found liable for retaliation, not discrimination, against one of the victims and was ordered to pay a $4.5 million judgment. With interest and fees, Cambridge paid a total of $8.3 million in this case. shortly thereafter, Cambridge settled of the other discrimination cases, the terms of which were not revealed.

The island separates Maputo Bay (Ba√≠a de Maputo) to the west from the Indian Ocean off its eastern shores. The island's irregular coastline approaches the mainland Machangulo peninsula at Ponta Torres where a tidal race separates the two headlands. In administrative terms Inhaca is a municipal district of the municipality of Maputo, while the Machangulo peninsula is included under the Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area and is part of the district of Matutu√≠ne, Maputo Province. Geographical features The island's dimensions are approximately 12 km (n-s) by 7 km (e-w). The highest point above sea level is the Mount Inhaca on the north- eastern shoreline. The south-western peninsula is known as Ponta Punduine while Ponta Torres to the south-east approaches the mainland. Two inland swamps occur at the northerly airstrip and southern Nhaquene respectively. Besides Inhaca settlement on the western shore there are five smaller villages including Inguane, Nhaquene, Ridjeni and Tobia. History Despite being a part of the Portuguese Mozambique until 1975, the island of Inhaca, so close to the harbour of Maputo, was occupied by the British from 1823 until the MacMahon Treaty of 24 July 1875. The British used the island (amongst many others all around Africa) to patrol and control the slave traffic in the region.Para a Hist√≥ria da Alian√ßa Luso Brit√¢nica, by Jos√© be Almada, Imprensa Nacional de Lisboa, 1955, pp. 60-61 Ecology =Flora= The island is regular destination for ecotourists and ecological researchers. The central land area consists of cultivated fields, while grassy plains are found to the north, flanked by protected usnea-covered dune forests along the eastern and western shores. Extensive exposed mudflats fringe the western and southern shores at low tide. Mangroves cover large sections of the northern shores and southern Saco Bay. The sub-tropical evergreen forest on the island includes the following tree species: Sideroxylon inerme, Apodytes dimidiata, Euclea schimperi, Manilkara discolor, Dovyalis rhamnoides, Dovyalis tristis, Diospyros natalensis, Clausena anisata, Cassine papillosa, Olea africana, Ficus burtt-davyi, Ficus sansibarica, Ficus capensis, Commiphora neglecta, Commiphora schlechteri, Allophylus melanocarpus, Erythroxylon emarginatum, Vepris undulata, Deinbollia oblongifolia, Scolopia ecklonii, Thespesia populnea and Galpinia transvaalica. =Fauna= Among 160 coral species are staghorn and plate corals. There are two badly damaged pure coral reefs flanking the island's western perimeters, in very shallow water, which are supposed to be protected but in reality there is no actual control of the marine reserves. Conspicuous fish are king mackerel - called serra, potato bass, barracuda and giant trevally. Others present are brindle bass/giant grouper, scorpionfish, butterflyfish, pufferfish, parrotfish, moray eel, Inhaca fringelip and seahorses. Whale sharks and manta rays visit in summer. =Whale watching= Monte Inhaca is a forested dune on the northeastern shoreline that reaches 104 m in altitude. Although humpback whales migrate seasonally past these shores whale watching has never become a popular attraction here. The ocean is generally too rough and the whales too far out, while the hiring boats is too expensive for the average person. Southern right whales have become rare today, though whales were historically abundantRichards R.. 2009.

Resident populations of the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin and the Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin occur in the waters around the island. The bottlenose dolphin's abundance fluctuates seasonally, increasing during the austral winter. The humpback dolphin is more resident, living in extremely shallow inshore areas of the western and southern coasts, and form larger groups (11-14 dolphins) than recorded elsewhere in southern Africa. Bottlenose dolphins frequent the waters of the northwestern coast, and their group size varies largely from individuals and pairs to hundreds of dolphins.

Even employees dismissed for gross misconduct are entitled to be paid their notice period and any statutory leave they have accumulated.https://www.gov.uk/holiday- entitlement-rights/taking-holiday-before-leaving-a-job 'In lieu of' means 'in place of', or 'instead of'.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_lieu If a notice period such as one month is required for an employer to terminate a contract, a 'payment in lieu of notice' is immediate compensation at an amount equal to that an employee would have earned as salary or wages by working through the whole notice period: for example, one month's salary. A payment in lieu will include payment for holiday entitlements if the employee has them. PILON can either be set out in the contract as an option for the employer, or it may simply be paid to cover any potential damages for breach of contract. If there is a pay in lieu of notice clause in the employee's contract, the amount the employee will get will normally be set out there. If not, it is up to the employee to agree to an amount. Sometimes, employees may be willing to accept a small amount if it is in their interests to leave early. The amount to be paid will normally cover all salaries that would have been earned during the notice period. That will normally cover basic pay and may include other things like commission and compensation for the loss of benefits, like personal use of a company car, phone, or medical insurance. The employer might instead decide to give the use of the benefits for the notice period. If employees think that the amount the employer is offering does not match what they would have earned, they can still consider making a breach of contract claim.

From August to September 2009, the sixth and final series of How Clean is Your House? was aired. From 2007 to 2009, Woodburn filmed a version of How Clean is Your House in Canada, called Kim's Rude Awakenings. In August 2009, Woodburn announced to Now magazine that she would not be making any further series of How Clean Is Your House? and Channel 4 announced soon afterwards that the series had been cancelled. =Reality television= In November 2009, Woodburn was announced as a contestant for the ninth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.

In November 2011, she entered the house to set a shopping task which she also judged, while berating the housemates for their hygiene. On 13 January 2017, Woodburn entered the Celebrity Big Brother house to participate as a housemate in its nineteenth series, entering on Day 11. After entering the house, she clashed with fellow new housemates Jessica Cunningham and Chloe Ferry after Ferry accidentally splashed her with water. She had arguments with James Jordan who mocked her for being a cleaner, as well as multiple arguments with Nicola McLean. On Day 15, Jamie O'Hara intervened in an argument between Woodburn and McLean after Kim called him a \\"chicken-livered bugger\\", Woodburn and O'Hara argued themselves and Kim told Jamie \\"you're an adulterer that two-timed his wife and has got three kids\\", this referring to Jamie cheating which was widely reported in the media. This resulted in security entering the house and Woodburn was ordered to sleep in a separate room for the night. Woodburn was immune from nominations during her first week in the house but was eventually nominated to face every eviction by her housemates. In the final, Woodburn was evicted and finished in third place with 14.52% of the final vote.

As a writer, then deputy editor, of the weekly music newspaper Melody Maker, he became an influential commentator on the rise of new forms of rock music at the end of the 1960s. Williams and MM, as it was known, helped promote and contextualise the progressive in pop music. In particular, Williams wrote several key articles around 1970 that increased UK attention to the (then disintegrating) Velvet Underground. Melody Maker still covered jazz and Williams wrote about the more progressive developments in this field also. The magazine's serious approach to rock music and culture, under the editorship of Ray Coleman, secured MM a huge circulation by the close of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s. It left New Musical Express, a more pop- orientated weekly, in its wake as MM caught the mood of rock followers at a time when the music had transcended its Top 40 roots to become a powerful symbol of social and cultural change. Williams was a vocal and influential supporter of Bob Marley during the early seventies. He wrote several key features at Melody Maker which resulted in Marley's first important cover stories. Williams moved on to new challenges in the early 1970s. Beginning in May 1970 he contributed to The Times and continued to write for that paper until October 1989. He also wrote regularly for Radio Times. He left journalism to join Island Records' A&R; department in 1973, becoming department head. For two years he signed and developed artists including Pete Wingfield, Stone Delight, Bryn Haworth and John Cale. The first presenter of the BBC rock show The Old Grey Whistle Test (launched in 1971) while still a member of the MM team, and shortly thereafter its producer, he later became editor of the new London listings guide Time Out and returned to MM as editor from 1978 to 1980.Old Grey Whistle Test DVD Vol 3; Bob Harris speaking before Track 3. After a period as features editor at The Sunday Times he became editor of the Independent on Sundays Sunday Review. His music journalism has been gathered in the volume Long Distance Call: Writings on Music and biographies of Bob Dylan (A Man Called Alias), Miles Davis (The Man in the Green Shirt), and Phil Spector (Out of His Head) are among his list of other publications. Williams remains an active journalist and is the former chief sports writer of The Guardian, covering a full array of sports. He has written several books on Formula One including The Death of Ayrton Senna, Racers (an analysis of the main participants of the 1996 F1 season), Enzo Ferrari: A Life, and The Last Road Race (a study of the changing balance in Formula One between British and Italian teams, using the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix as the backdrop). Williams' comments about music and related film, photography and art topics are published in the form of his blog, The Blue Moment.

Location The Jungle Prada site spans both public and private land. Portions of the Tocobaga mounds, as well as picnic tables, a fishing pier, and boat launch are located within the city park, and are maintained by the City of St. Petersburg. The better-preserved mounds, along with a small archeological museum, are located on private property and are accessible by guided tour.

A large, bulky species reaching at least in length, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without nictitating membranes, and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color. Inhabiting continental margins and oceanic waters at depths of , the bigeye sand tiger may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently. Taxonomy and phylogeny Head The first known bigeye sand tiger was a female long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a longline set for black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later formed the basis for a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist G√ºnther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo C√©sar de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens were examined in the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the smalltooth sand tiger. Other names for this shark include black sand tiger, oceanic sand tiger, and bigeye ragged-tooth shark. Whether the bigeye and smalltooth sand tigers belong in the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families. Description The teeth differ in shape in the bigeye sand tiger and in other, similar species. Lateral teeth Central teeth With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, and large mouth filled with protruding teeth, the bigeye sand tiger looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind the level of the eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34‚Äì43 upper and 37‚Äì46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower symphysis. In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, and those in the rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the smalltooth sand tiger, which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pectoral fins are medium-sized and broad with rounded tips. The large first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and is positioned closer to the pectoral than the pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about half the size of the first and originates over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are almost as large as the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and positioned behind it. The caudal peduncle has a crescent-shaped notch at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is short but distinct, while the upper lobe is long and has a deep notch in the trailing margin near the tip. The skin is covered by overlapping dermal denticles, each with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is plain dark reddish brown to chocolate brown, sometimes with black trailing margins on the fins or a white-tipped first dorsal fin. The eyes are dark orange with vertically oval, green-tinted pupils. There are several black patches inside the mouth, such as around the jaws, on the floor of the mouth, and on the gill arches. The largest male and female specimens measured long respectively. Distribution and habitat Though extremely rare, the bigeye sand tiger has been reported from scattered locations around the world, suggesting a wide and possibly disjunct global distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceanic waters. Most known specimens have come from the Atlantic, where it has been found off Madeira, southern Brazil, Texas, eastern Florida, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The only evidence for its presence in the Indian Ocean is a set of jaws that may have originated from the Seychelles, though the South China Sea is another possibility. The existence of this species in the Pacific Ocean was first suspected in 1970 from teeth recovered from bottom sediments, which was confirmed over a decade later by captures from the Marshall Islands and Hawaii. The bigeye sand tiger has been caught between the depths of . Some were recorded over continental and insular shelves, both from near the sea floor and in mid-water. Others were fished from parts of the open ocean that were deep, where they were swimming in the upper levels of the water column. Nighttime captures from relatively shallow depths suggest that this species may make a diel vertical migration, rising from the mesopelagic zone to the epipelagic zone at night to feed. In Brazilian waters, bigeye sand tigers are only captured in spring, hinting at some type of seasonal migratory movement. Biology and ecology One account of a bigeye sand tiger that had been caught alive noted that it behaved very aggressively, thrashing and snapping violently in and out of the water. Its large eyes and uniformly dark coloration are characteristic traits of a mesopelagic fish. The bigeye sand tiger feeds on bony fishes and squid. Its reproduction is little-known but probably similar to that of other mackerel sharks, which are viviparous with embryos that feed on unfertilized eggs during gestation (oophagy). Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. Males mature sexually at somewhere between long, while females mature at around long. No information is available on growth or aging. Human interactions Because the bigeye sand tiger is encountered so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It is caught incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.

It is the type site for the Safety Harbor culture, and includes the largest remaining mound in the Tampa Bay area.The sacred hill of Philippi Park It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Description The Safety Harbor Site is a major feature of Philippe Park. The site consists of the large temple mound, one smaller burial mound and two shell middens. The temple mound is roughly circular, in diameter and in height, with a summit plateau measuring about . It is built out of a series layers, alternating shells and sand. Archaeologists have uncovered features interpreted as post holes in the summit area, suggestive that a structure once stood there, either a residence or temple structure. There are also layers of clay, which are thought to represent levels that may have also been used in some way. The site is open to visitors during the daylight hours. In addition to the mounds, the park has walking paths, picnic areas, a boat ramp, fishing, and scenic views.Safety Harbor Mounds and Philippi Park Archaeological significance The site was documented as being occupied by early Spanish explorers of the region, who described it as the \\"capital city\\" of the Tocobaga people. Contact with these explorers probably introduced European diseases, which decimated the population and led to the site's abandonment, probably by 1700. It was first brought to the attention of archaeologists as early as 1880, but the first formal excavations took place only in 1929. Twentieth-century excavations, both sanctioned and illegal, resulted in the complete excavation of a burial mound which stood nearby. The county acquired the property in 1948, and has conducted investigations into the site since then. The site is the southernmost in Florida that exhibits the influence of Mississippian culture. Pottery finds at the site share characteristics with the contemporaneous Fort Walton culture.

It was founded as a La Salle School by Br Rolando Dizon FSC, a past President of De La Salle University, Manila, in 1986. History The construction of the school began on March 16, 1985. During this time, Kindergarten to Fourth Grade classes were temporarily held first at La Salle Green Hills. Construction was delayed because of the costs and logistics that were involved in building a school on a mountain. Classes were finally transferred to the Antipolo campus on January 13, 1986 and were housed in two buildings. A third building was completed in the summer of 1987, with a fourth one completed in 1989. The school's St. Benilde Multi-purpose Hall was finished in 1991, while the high school and laboratory-library buildings were completed in 1994. The Tertiary Education Unit was launched in 1998, with BS in Elementary Education and BS in Accountancy as the pioneer offerings. In 2006, La Salle College became part of De La Salle Philippines, Inc.

Demographic dividend occurs when the proportion of working people in the total population is high because this indicates that more people have the potential to be productive and contribute to growth of the economy. Due to the dividend between young and old, many argue that there is a great potential for economic gains, which has been termed the \\"demographic gift\\".Bloom, David E. and Jeffrey G. Williamson, 1998, Demographic Transitions and Economic Miracles in Emerging Asia, World Bank Economic Review, 12: 419 - 455. In order for economic growth to occur the younger population must have access to quality education, adequate nutrition and health including access to sexual and reproductive health. However, this drop in fertility rates is not immediate. The lag between produces a generational population bulge that surges through society. For a period of time this ‚Äúbulge‚Äù is a burden on society and increases the dependency ratio. Eventually this group begins to enter the productive labor force. With fertility rates continuing to fall and older generations having longer life expectancies, the dependency ratio declines dramatically. This demographic shift initiates the demographic dividend. With fewer younger dependents, due to declining fertility and child mortality rates, and fewer older dependents, due to the older generations having shorter life expectancies, and the largest segment of the population of productive working age, the dependency ratio declines dramatically leading to the demographic dividend. Combined with effective public policies this time period of the demographic dividend can help facilitate more rapid economic growth and puts less strain on families. This is also a time period when many women enter the labor force for the first time.http://www.economist.com/node/21533364 In many countries this time period has led to increasingly smaller families, rising income, and rising life expectancy rates. However, dramatic social changes can also occur during this time, such as increasing divorce rates, postponement of marriage, and single-person households. Recent education dividend theory Recent research shows that the demographic dividend is an education-triggered dividend Statistical overview Approximately 1.8 billion people between 10 and 24 years old exist in the world today; the highest total number of young people than ever before. According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), this number is expected to increase until 2070. Much of the increase has derived from the least developed countries who have experienced rapid and large growth in their youth populations. Within least developed countries‚Äô populations roughly 60% are under 24 years old. The large proportion of young people in least developed countries creates an opportunity to realize a demographic dividend. However, this realization comes with challenges. UNFPA stated that, ‚ÄúBy the middle of this century, the population of the least developed countries will have doubled in size, adding 14 million young people to the working-age population each year. Creating conditions for decent livelihoods will be an enormous task, especially given that, currently, about 80 per cent of the people who work in these countries are unemployed, underemployed or irregularly employed. Additionally, the shortage of financial resources will make it difficult to maintain, let alone increase, spending on health, education and nutrition.‚Äù Therefore, in order to reap the benefits of a demographic dividend, countries must recognize and cultivate the potential of young people and close the gap between the demands placed on young people and the opportunities provided to them. Examples =East Asia= East Asia provides some of the most compelling evidence to date of the demographic dividend. The demographic transition in East Asia occurred over 5‚Äì15 years during the 1950s and 1960s, a shorter time period than anywhere previously. During this time, East Asian countries invested in their youth and expanded access to family planning allowing people to start families later and have fewer children. More resources began to become available, investment in infrastructure began and productive investments were made as fertility rates fell resulting in unprecedented economic growth. For example, UNFPA stated that, ‚ÄúThe Republic of Korea, saw its per-capita gross domestic product grow about 2,200 per cent between 1950 and 2008 and Thailand‚Äôs GDP grew 970 per cent.\\" East Asia was able to benefit from knowledge, experience, and technology of other countries that had already passed through the demographic transition.Bloom, David E., David Canning and Jaypee Sevilla, 2003, The Demo: A New Perspective on the Economic Consequences of Population Change, Population Matters Monograph MR-1274, RAND, Santa Monica. It has been argued that the demographic dividend played a role in the \\"economic miracles\\" of the East Asian Tigers and accounts for between one fourth and two fifths of the ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù. =Ireland= Ireland also provides a recent example of the demographic dividend and transition. Faced with a high birth rate, the Irish government legalized contraception in 1979. This policy led to a decline in the fertility rate and a decrease in the dependency ratio. It has been linked as a contributing factor to the economic boom of the 1990s that was called the Celtic Tiger. During this time the dependency ratio also improved as a result of increased female labor market participation and a reversal from outward migration of working age population to a net inflow. =Africa= Africa, on the other hand has been unique demographically because fertility rates have remained relatively high, even as significant progress has been made decreasing the mortality rates. This has led to a continuing population explosion rather than a population boom and has contributed to the economic stagnation in much of Sub-Saharan Africa.Bloom, David E. and Jeffrey D. Sachs, 1998. Geography, Demography, and Economic Growth in Africa. Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2, 207-273.http://www.cid.harvard.edu/archive/malaria/docs/brookafr.pdf The magnitude of the demographic dividend appears to be dependent on the ability of the economy to absorb and productively employ the extra workers,Bloom, David E., David Canning and Jaypee Sevilla, 2003, The Demographic Dividend: A New Perspective on the Economic Consequences of Population Change, Population Matters Monograph MR-1274, RAND, Santa Monica. rather than be a pure demographic gift. According to the UN Population Fund, ‚ÄúIf sub-Saharan African countries are able to repeat the East Asian experience, the region could realize a demographic dividend amounting to as much as $500 billion a year for 30 years. For countries like Uganda in the Eastern Africa which is currently(2019) one of the least developed countries in the world may take quite a long period of time if there are no consistent efforts towards achieving the demographic dividend. =India= In near future India will be the largest individual contributor to the global demographic transition. A 2011 International Monetary Fund Working Paper found that substantial portion of the growth experienced by India since the 1980s is attributable to the country's age structure and changing demographics. By 2026 India's average age would be 29 which is least among the global average.

Four mechanisms for growth in the demographic dividend During the course of the demographic dividend there are four mechanisms through which the benefits are delivered. # The first is the increased labor supply. However, the magnitude of this benefit appears to be dependent on the ability of the economy to absorb and productively employ the extra workers rather than be a pure demographic gift. There is an accompanying indirect effect, as fewer children (and more schooling, see below) allow higher levels of female labor force participation. # The second mechanism is the increase in savings. As the number of dependents decreases individuals can save more. This increase in national savings rates increases the stock of capital in developing countries already facing shortages of capital and leads to higher productivity as the accumulated capital is invested. # The third mechanism is human capital. Decreases in fertility rates result in healthier women and fewer economic pressures at home. This also allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes. # The fourth mechanism for growth is the increasing domestic demand brought about by the increasing GDP per capita and the decreasing dependency ratio.Bloom, David E., David Canning and Jaypee Sevilla, 2003 The Demographic Dividend: A New Perspective on the Economic Consequences of Population Change This includes a possible second-order effect as household production falls, to be replaced by external provision, such as meals away from home and the purchase of ready-made clothing. right Low fertility initially leads to low youth dependency and a high ratio of working age to total population. However, as the relatively large working age cohort grows older, population aging sets in. The graph shows the ratio of working age to dependent population (those 15 to 64 years old, divided by those above or below this age range‚Äîthe inverse of the dependency ratio) based on data and projections from the United Nations. There is a strategic urgency to put in place policies which take advantage of the demographic dividend for most countries.http://live.worldbank.org/realizing-demographic-dividend-challenges- and-opportunities-ministers-finance-and-development This urgency stems from the relatively small window of opportunity countries have to plan for the demographic dividend when many in their population are still young, prior to entering the work force. During this short opportunity, countries traditionally try to promote investments which will help these young people be more productive during their working years. Failure to provide opportunities to the growing young population will result in rising unemployment and an increased risk of social upheaval. After the demographic dividend, demographic tax The urgency to put in place appropriate policies is magnified by the reality that what follows the ‚Äúdemographic dividend‚Äù is a time when the dependency ratio begins to increase again. Inevitably the population bubble that made its way through the most productive working years creating the ‚Äúdemographic dividend‚Äù grows old and retires. With a disproportionate number of old people relying upon a smaller generation following behind them the ‚Äúdemographic dividend‚Äù becomes a liability. With each generation having fewer children, population growth slows, stops, or even goes into reverse. This trend may be deemed a demographic taxhttp://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/1070772/asias-ageing-population-to- cost-20-trillion-study-says or demographic burden This is currently seen most dramatically in Japan, with younger generations essentially abandoning many parts of the country.‚ÄùA Tale of Three Islands‚Äù, The Economist October 22, 2011, http://www.economist.com/node/21533364 Other regions, notably Europe and North America, will face similar situations in the near future, with East Asia to follow after that. China's current independence ratio of 38 is unprecedentedly low. This represents the number of dependents, children, and people over 65 per 100 working adults. This implies that there are nearly twice as many working age people as the rest of the population. This historically low dependency ratio has been extremely beneficial for China's unprecedented period of economic growth. This dramatic shift was brought about largely due to China's one-child policy. As a result, China is currently aging at an unprecedented rate. China will be older than the United States by 2020 and than Europe by 2030. Combined with the sex-selective abortions widely practiced as a result of the one-child policy ‚Äì China will have 96.5 million men in their 20s in 2025 but only 80.3 million young women. China's future demography holds many challenges for the Chinese government.

It was first proposed by Skolem. Reprinted in translation in . as a formalization of his finitist conception of the foundations of arithmetic, and it is widely agreed that all reasoning of PRA is finitist. Many also believe that all of finitism is captured by PRA,. but others believe finitism can be extended to forms of recursion beyond primitive recursion, up to Œµ0,. which is the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic. PRA's proof theoretic ordinal is œâœâ, where œâ is the smallest transfinite ordinal. PRA is sometimes called Skolem arithmetic. The language of PRA can express arithmetic propositions involving natural numbers and any primitive recursive function, including the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. PRA cannot explicitly quantify over the domain of natural numbers. PRA is often taken as the basic metamathematical formal system for proof theory, in particular for consistency proofs such as Gentzen's consistency proof of first-order arithmetic.  Language and axioms  The language of PRA consists of: * A countably infinite number of variables x, y, z,.... *The propositional connectives; *The equality symbol =, the constant symbol 0, and the successor symbol S (meaning add one); *A symbol for each primitive recursive function. The logical axioms of PRA are the: * Tautologies of the propositional calculus; * Usual axiomatization of equality as an equivalence relation. The logical rules of PRA are modus ponens and variable substitution. The non-logical axioms are: * S(x) e 0; * S(x)=S(y) ~\\\\to~ x=y, and recursive defining equations for every primitive recursive function as desired. For instance, the most common characterization of the primitive recursive functions is as the 0 constant and successor function closed under projection, composition and primitive recursion. So for a (n+1)-place function f defined by primitive recursion over a n-place base function g and (n+2)-place iteration function h there would be the defining equations: * f(0,y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) = g(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) * f(S(x),y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) = h(x,f(x,y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n),y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) Especially: * x+0 = x\\\\ * x+S(y) = S(x+y)\\\\ * x \\\\cdot 0 = 0\\\\ * x \\\\cdot S(y) = x \\\\cdot y + x\\\\ * ... and so on. PRA replaces the axiom schema of induction for first-order arithmetic with the rule of (quantifier-free) induction: * From \\\\varphi(0) and \\\\varphi(x)\\\\to\\\\varphi(S(x)), deduce \\\\varphi(y), for any predicate \\\\varphi. In first-order arithmetic, the only primitive recursive functions that need to be explicitly axiomatized are addition and multiplication. All other primitive recursive predicates can be defined using these two primitive recursive functions and quantification over all natural numbers. Defining primitive recursive functions in this manner is not possible in PRA, because it lacks quantifiers.  Logic-free calculus  It is possible to formalise PRA in such a way that it has no logical connectives at all‚Äîa sentence of PRA is just an equation between two terms. In this setting a term is a primitive recursive function of zero or more variables. In 1941 Haskell Curry gave the first such system.. The rule of induction in Curry's system was unusual. A later refinement was given by Reuben Goodstein.. The rule of induction in Goodstein's system is: :{F(0) = G(0) \\\\quad F(S(x)) = H(x,F(x)) \\\\quad G(S(x)) = H(x,G(x)) \\\\over F(x) = G(x)}. Here x is a variable, S is the successor operation, and F, G, and H are any primitive recursive functions which may have parameters other than the ones shown. The only other inference rules of Goodstein's system are substitution rules, as follows: :{F(x) = G(x) \\\\over F(A) = G(A)} \\\\qquad {A = B \\\\over F(A) = F(B)} \\\\qquad {A = B \\\\quad A = C \\\\over B = C}. Here A, B, and C are any terms (primitive recursive functions of zero or more variables). Finally, there are symbols for any primitive recursive functions with corresponding defining equations, as in Skolem's system above. In this way the propositional calculus can be discarded entirely. Logical operators can be expressed entirely arithmetically, for instance, the absolute value of the difference of two numbers can be defined by primitive recursion: : \\\\begin{align} P(0) = 0 \\\\quad & \\\\quad P(S(x)) = x  x \\\\dot - 0 = x \\\\quad & \\\\quad x \\\\mathrel{\\\\dot -} S(y) = P(x \\\\mathrel{\\\\dot -} y)  x - y = & (x \\\\mathrel{\\\\dot -} y) + (y \\\\mathrel{\\\\dot -} x).  \\\\end{align} Thus, the equations x=y and x - y = 0 are equivalent. Therefore the equations x - y + u - v = 0 and x - y \\\\cdot u - v = 0 express the logical conjunction and disjunction, respectively, of the equations x=y and u=v. Negation can be expressed as 1 \\\\dot - x - y = 0.

It is a reverent title for the Blessed Mother and held as a pious belief in the Catholic Church. Most, Fr. William. Church Teaching on Mary's Co-Operation in the Redemption of Mankind Retrieved March 26th, 2020. According to those who use the term, Co-Redemptrix refers to a subordinate but essential participation by the Blessed Virgin Mary in redemption, notably that she gave free consent to give life to the Redeemer, which meant sharing his life, suffering, and death, which were redemptive for the world. Related to this belief is the concept of Mary as Mediatrix, which is a separate concept but regularly included by Catholics who use the title Co-Redemptrix. The concept was especially common in the late Middle Ages, when it was promoted heavily among the Franciscans, and often resisted by the Dominicans. By the early 16th century the hopes of the concept becoming Catholic doctrine had receded, and have never seriously revived. In more recent times, the title has received some support from the Catholic Magisterium‚ÄúTherefore, one can say, she [that is, the Blessed Virgin] redeemed with Christ the human race.‚Äù Pope Benedict XV, Apostolic Letter Inter soldalica, AAS 1918, 181. though it is not included in the concluding chapter of the apostolic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council, which chapter many theologians hold to be a comprehensive summary of Roman Catholic Mariology. Some, in particular the adherents of the Amsterdam visions, have petitioned for a dogmatic definition, along with Mediatrix, and the process for further theological clarification and eventual dogmatic definition is ongoing. Pope St. John Paul II was the most favorable of recent Popes. History As early as the year 200, the Church Father Irenaeus referred to Mary as the cause of our salvation () given her fiat (\\"let it be\\"). Theologians distinguish between \\"remote cooperation\\", by which she consents to the Incarnation and gives birth to the Son of God, and \\"immediate cooperation\\", in which she willingly unites herself to her Son's Passion and offers him back to the Father.Reynolds, Brian K. and Reynolds, Brian. Gateway to Heaven: Marian Doctrine and Devotion, Image and Typology in the Patristic and Medieval Periods, Vol. 1, New City Press, 2012, , p. 107 Philosophers also draw a distinction between merit de condigno (Christ's merit), which is based on justice, and merit proprie de congruo (Mary's merit), founded on the friendship of charity. The concept was especially common in the late Middle Ages, when it was promoted heavily among the Franciscans, and often resisted by the Dominicans. It is an idea which was the subject of considerable theological debate, reaching a peak in the 15th century.Ott 256 By the early 16th century the hopes of the concept becoming Catholic doctrine had receded, and have never seriously revived. A number of theologians have discussed the concept over the years, from the 19th-century Father Frederick William Faber, to the 20th-century Mariologist Father Gabriel Roschini.Gabriel Roschini, Compendium Mariologiae, Roma 1946. In his 1946 publication Compendium Mariologiae, Roschini explained that Mary did not only participate in the birth of the physical Jesus, but, with conception, she entered with him into a spiritual union. The divine salvation plan, being not only material, includes a permanent spiritual unity with Christ. Most Mariologists agree with this position.Schmaus, Mariologie, M√ºnchen, 1955, 328 The title tends to be most popular among conservative Catholics. Modern proponents see some support in Inter sodalica, a 1918 commemorative letter of Pope Benedict XV to a Roman sodality: As the Blessed Virgin Mary does not seem to participate in the public life of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, she is not there without divine intention. She suffers with her suffering and dying son, almost as if she would have died herself. For the salvation of mankind, she gave up her rights as the mother of her son and, in a sense, offered Christ's sacrifice to God the Father as far as she was permitted to do. Therefore, one can say, she redeemed with Christ the human race.Pope Benedict XV, Apostolic Letter Inter soldalica, AAS 1918, 181 There has been neither a retraction so far, nor any equivalent statements since. In his encyclical on the Immaculate Conception, Ad diem illum, Pope Pius X said, \\"...since Mary carries it over all in holiness and union with Jesus Christ, and has been associated by Jesus Christ in the work of redemption, she merits for us de congruo, in the language of theologians, what Jesus Christ merits for us de condigno.\\"Pope Pius X. Ad diem illum, ¬ß14, February 2, 1904, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Pope Pius XII, in his encyclical on the \\"Mystical Body of Christ\\", Mystici Corporis, said, It was she, the second Eve, who, free from all sin, original or personal, and always more intimately united with her Son, offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father for all the children of Adam, sin-stained by his unhappy fall, and her mother's rights and her mother's love were included in the holocaust. Thus she who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, through the added title of pain and glory became, according to the Spirit, the mother of all His members.Pope Pius XII. Mystici corporis, ¬ß110, June 29, 1943, Libreria Editrice Vaticana However, attempts to promote a fifth marian dogma undertaken in the 20s-40s of the twentieth century did not come to fruition due to Pius XII's veto. The term was not used in the concluding chapter of the apostolic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council, which chapter many theologians hold to be a comprehensive summary of Roman Catholic Mariology. Some, in particular the adherents of the Amsterdam visions, have petitioned for a dogmatic definition, along with Mediatrix, but recent high-level comments in the Church have not encouraged these hopes. On April 7, 2017, the Congregation of the Mother Coredemptrix was renamed to the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer upon the recommendation of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, due to the \\"theological ambiguity\\" of the title Coredemptrix. Context The concept of Mary offering Christ's sufferings is theologically complex. Christ offered himself alone; ‚Äúthe Passion of Christ did not need any assistance.‚ÄùSt. Ambrose, De inst. virg. 7, cited from Ott, Dogmatics. It is according to the spirit of the offertory or preparation of the gifts within the Mass to prepare to offer oneself with Christ as a part of the Eucharistic Prayer, being members of his mystical body, acknowledging that not even the greatest effort, of itself and apart from Christ, can be of any significance to God. A priest participates in the Eucharistic Celebration as an icon of Christ. The Holy Office has forbidden reference to Mary as a priestess. Mary ‚Äúmerits for us de congruo‚Äù, i.e. by way of a fitting reward not binding upon God, ‚Äúwhat Jesus Christ merits for us de condigno‚Äù, i.e. by God binding himself to give the reward.Pope St. Pius X, encyclical Ad diem illum 14 It is uncertain whether Pope Pius X meant \\"for us‚Äù to mean all mankind except Christ's human nature and Mary, or only those living after Mary's merits, since the former could potentially break the general rule that the effect comes after the cause. Where it concerns post-Assumption graces, it is a pious opinion that the entirety of them come through the \\"intercession\\" of Mary,‚ÄúMary is the intermediary through whom is distributed unto us this immense treasure of mercies gathered by God, for mercy and truth were created by Jesus Christ. Thus as no man goeth to the Father but by the Son, so no man goeth to Christ but by His Mother.‚Äù Leo XIII, encyclical Octobri mense 4. Ott, Dogmatics, Mariology ¬ß 7 even thinks that, in spite of uncertain evidence in the Sources of Faith, a dogmatic definition does not seem impossible. a concept that is in itself in need of clarification. The Roman Catholic view of the title Co-Redemptrix does not imply that Mary participates as equal part in the redemption of the human race, since Christ is the only redeemer.1Tim 2,5 Mary herself needed redemption and was redeemed by Jesus Christ. Being redeemed by Christ, implies that she cannot be his equal part in the redemption process.Ott Dogmatics 256 Similarly, if Mary is described as the mediatrix of all graces, it ‚Äúis to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator‚Äù.Second Vatican Council, dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium 62, citing St. Ambrose, Epist. 63: PL 16, 1218. Pope Pius XII in Munificentissimus Deus, the bull defining the dogma of the Assumption of Mary, used the expression \\"the revered Mother of God, ... joined ... with Jesus Christ in one and the same decree of predestination ... as the noble associate of the divine Redeemer\\".Munificentissimus Deus 40 This whole topic is made more complex by the evolving understanding of what \\"sacrifice\\" means in the Catholic church, whether it is propitiatory or expiatory. Proposed dogmatic definition There have been efforts to propose a formal dogmatization, which has had both popular and ecclesiastical support. The proposal for the dogma is often associated with the alleged apparitions of The Lady of All Nations to Ida Peerdeman, in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The visionary reported that the Lady of the apparition repeatedly instructed her to petition Pope Pius XII to dogmatically define Mary's spiritual motherhood under the threefold title of Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, and Advocate. In the intervening decades, the Church's stance on the Amsterdam apparitions has been mixed. As of 2002, the apparitions have the approval of the diocesan ordinary, Bishop Jozef Marianus Punt of Haarlem-Amsterdam. The possibility of such a dogma was brought up at the Second Vatican Council by Italian, Spanish, and Polish bishops, but not dealt with on the council floor.Otto Hermann Pesch Das Zweite Vatikanische Konzil, Echter, 1993, 194. Subsequently, \\"not only did the Council not take the route of a dogmatic pronouncement, but it positively avoided using 'coredemptio'\\", and popes pointedly did not include such language in their encyclicals. In the early 1990s Prof. Mark Miravalle of the Franciscan University of Steubenville and author of the book Mary: Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, Advocate launched a popular petition to urge Pope John Paul II to declare Mary Coredemptrix ex cathedra. Salvatore Perrella, O.S.M., of the Pontifical Theological Faculty of the Marianum in Rome, thought that this indicated \\"...a certain 'under-appreciation' of the Council's teaching, which is perhaps believed to be not completely adequate to illustrate comprehensively Mary's co-operation in Christ's work of Redemption.\\" Scriptural basis The New Testament is commonly cited in favour of this teaching: *: \\"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen. When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son. After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.\\" Lumen gentium, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, states, \\"...In this singular way she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope and burning charity in the work of the Saviour in giving back supernatural life to souls. Wherefore she is our mother in the order of grace.\\"Pope Paul VI, Lumen Gentium, November 21, 1964, ¬ß61 *: \\"[I, Paul,] now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church‚Äù. If Paul could fill up what was behind, so could the Blessed Virgin Mary a fortiori. At the same time, this is easily interpreted as the task of all Christians to mediate the face of Christ to the world. Opposing arguments Arguments opposed are that such a dogma might limit, in popular understanding, the redemptive role of Jesus Christ. Faber says, Faber recognized that the term Co-Redemptrix usually requires some explanation in modern English because so often the prefix co- tends to imply complete equality. He also explains that, \\"Thus, so far as the literal meaning of the word is concerned, it would appear that the term co-redemptress is not theologically true, or at least does not express the truth it certainly contains with theological accuracy.\\" This concern is shared by Perrella. > The semantic weight of this expression would require a good many other > qualifications and clarifications, especially in the case under examination, > where she who is wished to be proclaimed co-redeemer is, in the first place, > one who is redeemed, albeit in a singular manner, and who participates in > Redemption primarily as something she herself receives. Thus we see the > inadequacy of the above-mentioned term for expressing a doctrine which > requires, even from the lexical standpoint, the proper nuances and > distinctions of levels. It was rejected by the Vatican in the past because of serious theological difficulties.\\"Co-Redemptrix as Dogma?\\", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton In August 1996, a Mariological Congress was held in Czƒôstochowa, Poland, where a commission was established in response to a request of the Holy See. The congress sought the opinion of scholars present there regarding the possibility of proposing a fifth Marian dogma on Mary as Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, and Advocate. The commission unanimously declared that it was not opportune, voting 23-0 against the proposed dogma.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English 25 June 1997, page 10 Another argument is that it would also complicate ecumenical efforts for a better understanding of the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the salvation mystery of Jesus Christ. By 1998 it was doubtful the Vatican was going to consider new Marian dogmas. The papal spokesman stated \\"This is not under study by the Holy Father nor by any Vatican congregation or commission.\\"Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Catholic Herald, 1997-08-22, p.7. A leading Mariologist stated the petition was \\"theologically inadequate, historically a mistake, pastorally imprudent and ecumenically unacceptable.\\"Father Salvatore Perrella, The Message, 1997-09-05, p.5. Pope John Paul II cautioned against \\"all false exaggeration\\";L'Osservatore Romano, January 1996 his teaching and devotion to Mary has strictly been \\"exalting Mary as the first among believers but concentrating all faith on the Triune God and giving primacy to Christ.\\" In his 1994 Apostolic letter, Tertio Milennio Adveniente, John Paul said, \\"Christ, the Redeemer of the world, is the one Mediator between God and men, and there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved (cf. Acts 4:12).\\"Pope John Paul II. Tertio Milennio Adveniente, ¬ß4, November 10, 1994, Libreria Editrice Vaticana When asked in an interview in 2000 whether the Church would go along with the desire to solemnly define Mary as Co- redemptrix, then-Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) responded that, \\"...the formula ‚ÄúCo-redemptrix‚Äù departs to too great an extent from the language of Scripture and of the Fathers and therefore gives rise to misunderstandings. ...Everything comes from Him [Christ], as the Letter to the Ephesians and the Letter to the Colossians, in particular, tell us; Mary, too, is everything she is through Him. The word ‚ÄúCo-redemptrix‚Äù would obscure this origin. A correct intention being expressed in the wrong way.Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, God and the World: A Conversion with Peter Seewald. Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 2002, p. 306 In December 2019, at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica celebrating the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Pope Francis said in referring to a picture of La Morenita that three terms came to mind, woman, mother and mestiza; the latter because \\"Mary makes God a mestizo, true God but also true man.‚Äù He also discouraged proposals for a new dogmatic title. \\"‚ÄúWhen they come to us with the story of declaring her this or making that dogma, let‚Äôs not get lost in foolishness [in Spanish, tonteras],‚Äù he said.\\"San Mart√≠n, In√©s. \\"Pope calls idea of declaring Mary co-redemptrix ‚Äòfoolishness‚Äô\\", Crux, December 13, 2019 Ren√© Laurentin, theologian specializing in Mariology, said \\"‚ÄúThere is no mediation or co-redemption except in Christ.

Biography Ishtori Haparchi was born in Provence, France, in 1280. Haparchi was descended from a line of sages and rabbis of fame. His father was Rabbi Moshe HaParhi, a distinguished Talmudical scholar. His grandfather was Rabbi Nathan of Trinquetaille, author of Shaar HiTefisa. His great-grandfather was Meir ben Isaac of Carcassonne, author of the Sefer ha-'Ezer. When the Jews were expelled from France in 1306, he travelled to Spain and Egypt, and then settled in the Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael in Hebrew). He worked as a physician in Bet She'an, where he died in 1355. Book Kaftor va-Ferach by Ishtori Haparchi Writings Ishtori Haparchi was the author of the first Hebrew book on the geography of the Land of Israel, Sefer Kaftor va-Ferach (), literally \\"Book of Bulb and Flower\\", or \\"Knob and Flower,\\" written in 1322 in the Land of Israel and published in Venice in 1549. \\"Knob and Flower\\" is a Hebrew idiom meaning \\"work of art,\\" and is derived from the description of the menorah in . In the context of the book it refers to the agrarian laws practised by the nation of Israel. Haparchi lists the names of towns and villages in the Land of Israel and discusses the topography of the land based on first-hand visits to the sites. He describes its fruits and vegetables, and draws upon earlier rabbinic commentaries, such as the commentary compiled by Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek of Siponto. Modern scholarship relies heavily upon the 180 ancient sites he identified and described in relation to other sites, among them Usha, Modi'in and Betar.

Once the flagship of Julian and Abe Saenger's theatre empire, today it is one of only a handful of Saenger movie palaces that remain. History Postcard view of the Saenger on Canal Street, circa 1940. =Early decades= The Saenger Theatre opened on February 4, 1927. The 4,000-seat theatre took three years to build and cost $2.5 million. Its opening prompted thousands to parade along Canal Street. The top ticket price was 65 cents, and the bill for each performance included a silent movie and stage play (produced by the Paramount-Publix Corporation), and music from the Saenger Grand Orchestra. Architect Emile Weil designed the interior of an atmospheric theatre to recall an Italian Baroque courtyard. Weil installed 150 lights in the ceiling of the theatre, arranged in the shape of constellations of the night sky. The theatre also employed special effects machines to project images of moving clouds, sunrises, and sunsets across the theatre's interior. In 1929, Julian Saenger sold the theatre for $10 million to Paramount Publix, which continued to operate the theatre successfully throughout the Great Depression. In 1933 Paramount Publix converted the theatre to \\"talking pictures\\" only. =A neglected landmark= In 1964, ABC Interstate Theatres turned the Saenger into a piggyback theatre, building a wall in front of the balcony to divide the larger space into two smaller theatres. The upstairs theatre was known as the Saenger Orleans. On September 29, 1977 the theatre was designated a historic landmark by the New Orleans Landmark Commission. That December it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. =First renovation and return to prominence= Katrina In 1978, it was sold for slightly more than $1 million to E.B. Breazeale, who then spent an additional $3 million (with co-investors Zev Buffman and Barry Mendelson) renovating it into a performing arts center. Pace Management also invested in the renovation and was hired to run the theatre. The Saenger Theatre reopened in 1980 with a reduced seating capacity of 2,736. Johnny Carson made a gala performance at the theatre's grand reopening. The Saenger hosted a variety of events, including concerts in many musical styles, theater shows, and presentations harkening back to the theatre's earlier history such as a showing of Abel Gance's Polyvision silent film spectacular Napol√©on accompanied by a live full orchestra. In April 1983, Styx recorded and filmed their performances on their Kilroy Was Here tour for their double live album and concert film Caught in the Act. Then, in 1985, the management team of the theatre formed the Saenger Theatre Partnership, Ltd., a joint venture with 50 partners, to purchase the theatre from Breazeale. In the summer of 2002, the Saenger Theatre continued its cinematic roots and showed three classic movies (Some Like It Hot, The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind) in celebration of its 75th anniversary. The Summer Classic Movie Series became an annual event for the next 3 years. =Hurricane Katrina= When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, the Saenger Theatre suffered significant water damage. The water line was approximately a foot above stage level, filling the basement and orchestra seating area. Fortunately it was in the middle of a major renovation, so all carpeting and seating had been removed in anticipation of being replaced. The vintage Robert Morton Wonder Organ at stage level suffered some damage. The administrative offices of the theatre and the box office on Rampart Street suffered extensive water damage. Photos taken immediately after Katrina often portrayed the Canal Street marquee as damaged, but staff had in fact removed the acrylic glass and other materials that could become flying debris during the storm. =Planned second renovation= In early 2009 it was announced by New Orleans officials that ownership of the Saenger Theatre would be turned over to the Canal Street Development Corp., a city agency, who would lease the building to the Saenger Theatre Partnership, Ltd. for 52 years. A stipulation of the deal requires the Saenger Theatre Partnership to host a minimum of 80 shows and sell 100,000 tickets each year. The unique alliance secured $15 million in federal grants, state and federal tax credits, and private financing as part of a $38.8 million restoration. February 2010: Marquee celebrates the victorious New Orleans Saints A main focus of the restoration is to return the Saenger to its original state. Work will include stripping paint to reveal the building's original color scheme, along with using historic photographs to match hardware such as doors, light fixtures, and windows as closely as possible. The escalator in the arcade will be removed, the main entrances will be recessed to reflect the original floor plan, and marquees matching the originals will be installed. Renovations will also include updates, such as incorporating the adjacent 1101 Canal Street building to use as a restaurant, restrooms, and box offices; expanding the stage by 40%; installing central air conditioning; and replacing the ceiling's trademark constellation with LED lights. All work, including modern updates, will adhere to strict preservation guidelines set by various entities including the National Park Service. The marquee was ceremoniously re-lit in October 2009 to signify the Saenger Theatre's rebirth. The marquee will be lit every night until the theatre reopens in the fall of 2011. In the first months of 2010 restoration work was begun on the theater. In addition a website was launched and the broadway tour producers Broadway Across America announced that The Lion King will play at the Saenger during the 2011-2012 season. The full schedule has yet to be released. NOLA.com announced that construction on the theatre would begin in July 2010. However, in March 2011 it was announced that construction had not started, and the Saenger would not be ready until at least the 2012-2013 Broadway season. In December 2011 New Orleans officials announced final financial hurdles had been cleared and construction would begin in earnest on the $51 million renovation in January 2012.Frank Donze, \\"Saenger Theatre overhaul breaks financial logjam\\", \\"The Times-Picayune\\", December 30, 2011 In June 2013, the Saenger Theatre announced it would be opening September 27 with three performances from comedian Jerry Seinfeld; one on September 27 and two on September 28. The opening gala would be held October 3‚Äì6.Doug MacCash, \\"The Saenger Theatre in New Orleans reopens Sept. 28 with Jerry Seinfeld\\", \\"The Times-Picayune\\", June 13, 2013 The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the site as one of ten historic sites saved in 2013. Organ The Saenger Theatre features an approximately 2000-pipe Robert Morton theatre organ, installed at the theater's opening. One of the largest instruments ever built by the Robert Morton Organ Company of Van Nuys, California, it was the prototype for the company's \\"Wonder Morton\\" line. The organ has a four manual console and 26 ranks of pipes. Nine ranks extend to the 16' pitch. It was designed specifically for the acoustics of the Saenger, and is one of the few Robert-Morton organs in the United States still in the location of its original installation. According to theater historian Ben M. Hall, the famed theater organist Jesse Crawford said the Saenger's Morton was the finest instrument he had ever played.http://saengeramusements.com/theatres/nawlins/saenger/organ/nosabhl.jpg See also * List of concert halls * List of music venues * Theatre in Louisiana * Saenger Theatre (Mobile, Alabama) * Saenger Theatre (Pensacola, Florida) References External links * Official Site * History of Saenger Theatres * Sarnoff, Nancy. \\"Houstonians to renovate New Orleans theater.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Its studios are located off US 101 and Hellyer Ave in South San Jose and the transmitter is on a hill in Santa Teresa County Park. The station competes with KUFX and KSAN. 94.5 FM history Logo used as KFAT from 1975 to January 16, 1983 The facility went on the air in 1970 as KPER-FM at 94.3. The station broadcast in Gilroy with 3,000 watts and was co- owned with KAZA 1290 AM. KAZA and KPER-FM were split in 1973; Entertainment Radio, Inc., bought the FM and changed the call letters to KSND. Entertainment Radio filed to move the station to 94.5 from Loma Prieta Peak, noting that KPFA's grandfathered signal caused interference problems. The FCC agreed. When the new station reemerged in 1975, it became KFAT with a freeform country/rock format. In 1976, the station was sold to Wheatstone Bridge Engineering Company, and in 1980, KFAT-Levin Radio acquired the station. KFAT was co- founded by Laura Ellen Hopper, Jeremy Lansman, and Lorenzo Milam, who helped start many of community radio's pioneering stations in the United States. Harvey Levin, the majority owner of KFAT-Levin Radio, died of cancer in May 1982 at the age of 38, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to KFAT's demise. In order to pay down debts, he had instructed his estate to sell KUIC in Vacaville to pay down debt and fund the continuation of KFAT, but the down payment on the Vacaville station was simply too high, and KFAT was sold first. Western Cities Broadcasting paid $3.6 million for the station, and needing vastly improved economic results from what KFAT was delivering, on January 17, 1983, KFAT flipped to CHR as KWSS. (Santa Cruz-area station KPIG- FM was heavily inspired by the legacy of KFAT.) KWSS, which moved its studios from Gilroy to San Jose shortly after the sale, was a well-regarded hit music station in the South Bay area. Bill Kelly & Al Kline were morning hosts of the station before moving to KXXX in early 1989. Other known personalities were Steven Seaweed (KLRB, KFAT, KRQR, KSAN), Craig Hunt, John Mack Flanagan (of KFRC), Barry Beck, Larry Morgan (of KIIS-FM), Danny Miller, Tim Anthony, and Dr. Dave Lewis. In late 1986, it was acquired by Nationwide Communications. On March 1, 1991, KWSS abruptly ended its broadcast and stunted with a loop of \\"Louie, Louie\\" by The Kingsmen for 3 days. On March 4, it flipped to classic rock as KUFX.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1991/RR-1991-03-08.pdf KBAY radio history The KBAY call letters were originally assigned to a UHF television station (Channel 20), based in San Francisco. It ceased operation after a few years due to the scant number, in the 1950s, of Bay Area homes with UHF-capable television sets. Channel 20 returned to the air as KEMO, eventually becoming today's KOFY-TV. Originally at 104.5 in the 1950s, KBAY 100.3 FM, became the market leader in San Jose and had a very strong listening audience in both the San Jose and San Francisco markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Its easy listening format gave way to light jazz instrumentals and by the early 1990s, pop music was introduced. The Snell family guided the station and its sister, KEEN Country 1370 AM through the decades as United Broadcasting. The Snells sold their 2 properties in 1997, and KBAY became a part of the American Radio Systems group which included KKSJ (the former KEEN), KUFX, and KSJO. Shortly thereafter, a 3-way swap of frequencies landed KBAY at 94.5 FM. KBAY then became known as \\"The Bay\\" for a couple of years. American Radio Systems sold KBAY to Infinity/CBS in 1999. In the early 2000s, the KBAY identity was replaced by B-94.5 \\"The Bee\\". This was an attempt to distance the station from the perceived \\"stigma\\" of its earlier life as an \\"elevator music\\" station. In September 2003, KBAY's owner CBS-Infinity Radio removed its \\"World Music\\" format called \\"The Wave\\" from its 93.3 frequency in order for KBAY to simulcast on it. Infinity moved the KBAY studios to San Francisco and 94.5 became legally identified as KBAA. The simulcast experiment lasted only a year much to the relief of its staff, largely from the South Bay. 93.3 was sold and became KRZZ with a Regional Mexican music format, and the KBAY call letters returned to 94.5. CBS-Infinity Radio sold KBAY and its sister Mix 106.5 KEZR FM to NextMedia Group in 2005. Effective February 10, 2014, KBAY, KEZR, and the 31 other NextMedia radio stations nationwide became part of a new broadcasting group headed by Dean Goodman called Digity LLC, an affiliate of Palm Beach Broadcasting, LLC, for a purchase price of $85 million. The company ran about 60 locally programmed stations. Effective February 25, 2016, Digity, LLC and its 124 radio stations were acquired by Alpha Media for $264 million. On December 16, 2016, \\"Sam and Lissa in the Morning\\" ended its run on KBAY, as Sam Van Zandt retired, and Lissa Kreisler was let go from the station. Van Zandt had worked in radio for 50 years, and Kreisler had worked at KBAY for 29 years. The letting go of Kreisler was much to the disapproval of listeners, and she even stated that she \\"wanted a few more years.\\" 2016 also saw Dana Jang, its program director since 2005, depart, and Ronnie Stanton, who had last worked as program director at Vancouver's CFOX-FM, take over; evening host Nicci Ross also departed the station at the same time and moved to rival KISQ. The changes came as KBAY was facing increasing competition from KOIT and KISQ in the San Francisco market. The two San Francisco stations also appear in San Jose's ratings. In 2018, veteran programmer Dave Numme was appointed Program Director/Content Director for 94-5 Bay FM and its sister, Mix 106/KEZR. About the same time, the stations' studios were moved from downtown San Jose after 20 years to a South San Jose business park. Under Numme's leadership, ratings for Bay-FM have consistently been #1 in San Jose as well as at the top of San Francisco's ratings for key demographics and dayparts. His airstaff consists of Bruce Scott in the morning, long-time midday host (since 1996) Jona Denz-Hamilton, Kirk Peffer in the afternoon, followed by nights with Nancy Newcomer. Also on staff are Russ R.C. Cecil and another South Bay veteran, Karin Nakamura. Elvis is the newest DJ to join the staff.  Christmas Music  KBAY switched to Christmas music every year from Thanksgiving through Christmas Day from approximately 2002 through 2017. In 2016, KBAY switched on November 19, almost a week earlier than usual, in response to KOIT also switching earlier. During its Christmas music stint of 2016, KBAY began running liners promoting \\"one last present\\" from the station, to come at 5 p.m. on Christmas Day. Alpha Media announced on December 21 that KBAY would end its adult contemporary format after over 20 years and flip to classic hits as \\"94.5 Bay FM\\" at that time. The last song on KBAY was \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" by Straight No Chaser, and the first song on Bay FM was \\"We Built This City\\" by San Francisco band Starship.KBAY San Jose To Flip To Classic HitsKBAY Becomes 94.5 Bay FM With the change, KBAY became the only Classic Hits station in San Jose and the adjacent San Francisco market. Bay FM announced it would, however, continue KBAY's annual Christmas Music programming, which had a significant positive effect on their ratings. It continued for one more year. The cessation of Christmas music has proven to be a ratings boost for Bay FM with its Classic Hits format.

Born in Paris, he was the son of Emile-Justin Menier and grandson to Antoine Brutus Menier who founded the Menier Chocolate company. On his father's death in 1881, Henri Menier became mayor of Noisiel, an office he held for 32 years until his death in 1913. The beneficiary of a substantial fortune, and having a large annual income from the family business, Henri Menier spent a great deal of his time and money pursuing various leisure interests, notably yachting and auto racing. As the eldest son, Henri Menier was the titular head of the company but the day-to-day management would mostly be left to his very capable brother Gaston. A member of the governing council of the Yacht Club de France, Menier studied naval architecture and yacht design. He owned several large sailing and steam powered yachts and journeyed to numerous European ports and with his a group of friends including Ren√© Waldeck-Rousseau, sailed north to Iceland and Norway. Menier undertook a three-year-long voyage through the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. He also sailed across the Atlantic Ocean several times to visit Anticosti Island that he owned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. When automobiles made their debut, Henri Menier was one of the few who could afford them. He became a racing enthusiast and helped found the Automobile Club de France which would organize the 1906 French Grand Prix, the world's first Grand Prix motor racing event, at the Circuit de la Sarthe, in Le Mans. Menier took part in the 1902 Gordon Bennett Cup Paris to Innsbruck auto race and won the silver medal in the touring car category. Avid hunters of deer on horseback, Henri Menier and his brothers acquired more than 13,000 acres (53 km¬≤) of forested land in the Picardy region as well as in the Val-d'Oise d√©partement where Henri owned a ch√¢teau in the town of Vaur√©al. In April 1913 Henri Menier also bought the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau in France's Loire Valley which today is still owned by family members and is a major tourist attraction. Anticosti Island development In 1895, Henri Menier bought Anticosti Island at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River in Canada from a British logging company. Originally granted to Louis Jolliet as a seigniory by King Louis XIV, it is a large and heavily forested island and at 217 km in length and 16‚Äì48 km wide is one-quarter the size of the country of Belgium. Menier used it for business as well as a private game reserve, bringing in a variety of wild animals native to Canada including foxes, fishers, reindeer, bison and moose. One of the other species Menier introduced was a herd of 220 white-tailed deer who, because there were no natural predators, thrived. The island's deer population is now is estimated at well over 100,000. Along with its 24 rivers and streams bountiful with salmon and trout, it is today a paradise for paleontologists, bird watchers, hikers, and a major draw for anglers and hunters, particularly those from the United States. Port-Menier, Anticosti Island, c. 1922 Henri Menier named the Vaur√©al Falls on Anticosti Island after the town of Vaur√©al in France where he owned a home. At Anticosti, he hoped to set up a seigniory that could be self- supporting. He first established a settlement at Bay Sainte-Claire in 1895 but the bay proved too shallow for the large ships he would need. In 1900, he moved the settlement to Ellis Bay and established Port-Menier along the waterfront with a 1,000 meter wharf. He invested a substantial amount of money to construct a sawmill to service the logging operations that harvested softwood timber for building lumber and Wood pulp for the manufacture of paper products. The community was centered around a new cannery business designed to take advantage of the abundant supply of fish and lobsters. The town had its own hospital, school, Roman Catholic church, general store, bank, bakery, hotel, plus homes and rooming houses for the workers, and 30-room Scandinavian-style mansion for himself. Once completed, the island was home to 800 permanent residents, most of whom were French Canadians. Residents and businesses obtained supplies from a sailing ship Menier operated between Quebec City and the Gasp√©, and obtained coal from the mines at Sydney, Nova Scotia. In June 1911, Henri Menier married H√©l√®ne Thyra Seilli√®re who shared his love of the outdoors. However, a diabetic, he died childless a little more than a year after his marriage. He was buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. His brother Gaston became the owner of Anticosti Island. He used and maintained it for a time but eventually decided it was not an economically viable proposition and sold it to the Wayagamack Pulp and Paper Company in 1926. Many of the original houses still stand today. Rue Henri Menier in Sept- √éles, Quebec was named in his honor.

Since then, he dreamt of leaving that world to work in something that would allow him to have a public presence and voice. He had a very strong interest in radio and television and used to go to the city to watch television through windows of various houses. He once got caught doing so by a homeowner who accused him of being a thief. After hearing his story, however, he allowed him to enter the house and watch television with the family. Al Qassim's family were able to buy a black and white television set of their own after electricity was introduced to his village. Al-Qassim originally aspired to become a weather report presenter on television. Career =Work in Media= Before joining Al Jazeera, Al- Qassem worked for the BBC Arabic Radio and TV for over eight years as producer and anchor of political and cultural programs. * 1994-1996: Worked as a news presenter and host for the show \\"Behind the News\\" on BBC television. * 1993-1996: News journalist for The Arab Emirates Radio in London. * 1991: Producer and presenter of The Journalism Show for MBC channel. * 1989-1988: Producer and presenter of cultural shows in the Arab department at BBC. * Producer and presenter of multiple entertainment and music shows at BBC, including \\"Adwaa Wa Qadaya\\" (Lights and Cases), \\"Araa Wa Maraya\\" (Opinions and Mirrors), and others. * Producer and presenter of several political programs at BBC, including \\"Al-Aalam Hatha Al Sabaah\\" (The World This Morning), \\"Aalam Al Thaheera\\" (Afternoon World), and others. * Has many article contributions in Syrian newspapers. *1988-1992: Has many article contributions in \\"Al-Hayat\\" (Life), \\"Al-Sharq Al-Awsat\\" (The Middle East), and \\"Huna London\\" (This is London) newspapers. * Has many article contributions is=n American Magazines. * Writes a weekly article in \\"Al-Sharq\\" (The East) Qatari Newspaper until today. * 1996: Joined Al-Jazeera as a news and show presenter. * 1997: Launched \\"The Opposite Direction\\" show. =The Opposite Direction= \\"The Opposite Direction\\" is regarded as probably the most controversial talk show in the history of Arab television. It is also one of the most popular, and has drawn official protest and complaints from officials. It is similar to CNN's Crossfire, and is a political debate show that features guests who hold opposing opinions and debate a controversial topic. Hugh Miles writes in his book on Al-Jazeera \\"the show has been the source of numerous international disputes and instigated the severance of diplomatic relations with several neighboring countries.\\" Dr. Faisal Al-Qassem prepares the show himself, researching, writing, and presenting it single-handedly. Through it, he has become one of the most famous faces in the Arab World. Al-Qassem's program has led to diplomatic crises between the state of Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, and several Arab countries, five of which withdrew their ambassadors from Doha in protest over the program.Tayler, Jeffrey. \\"The Faisal factor: a talk-show host on al-Jazeera targets those he believes are the worst enemies the Arabs have: themselves.(Brief Lives).\\" The Atlantic Monthly 294.4 (Nov 2004): 41(3). Faisal Al-Qassem has stated that his mission is to liberate the Arab World from dictatorship, despots, and traditions. He believes that Al- Jazeera and his show have been successful in doing that. =Publications= Al-Qassem has published the following book titles in Arabic: *Politics and Literature (Arabic: ) *Memorize and Shut-Up (Arabic: ) *The Missing Dialogue in Arab Culture (Arabic: ) ŸÅŸäÿµŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿ≥ŸÖ Views & criticisms Al-Qassem has been viewed in many cases as a big supporter of the 2011 Arab revolutions, by fueling them and spreading awareness through his show \\"The Opposite Direction\\". His colleague and friend, Yahya Abo-Zakariya, describes the introductory scenes of the show presented by Al-Qassem as more like revolution statements, backed up with dramatic music effects that made them sound very powerful. The show became a fuel to the revolutions and has allowed the accumulation of awareness on revolt and public awakening which in turn played a part in creating a situation of the Arab revolt against the current situation. Nonetheless, Al-Qassem has been widely criticized by various people for different reasons. He has been criticized for his selection of guests, such as for the episode on the alleged terrorist armed gangs of Syria, where he hosted a military personality to debate with a Lebanese author, where the military personality was viewed as incompetent and inappropriate for such a debate. In addition, a Syrian blogger has criticized and attacked him, describing him as sectarian due to his selection of pro-government guests only from the Christian sect to debate with opposition figures mainly from the Muslim-Sunni sect, accusing him of trying to give the revolution a sectarian appearance. Also, Al-Qassem's statements that described the Yemeni people as drunks due to their high percentage of qat drug addiction raised a huge amount of criticism on him and his show among Yemenis. Some have even demanded a public apology from him for insulting the Yemeni people. On February 13, 2019, Israeli comedienne Noam Shuster-Eliassi, speaking to i24 News, joked that she would like to marry the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. On February 17, Al- Qassem posted on his Facebook account about Shuster-Eliassi's comment. Subsequently, BBC Arabic and Al Jazeera covered the story as if Shuster- Eliassi's proposal were genuine.

Career Miranda signed for St Mirren in August 2007, on loan from Argentine club CAI. He had returned to Argentina from Sweden, where he was with Helsingborg. Miranda has also played for River Plate during his career. In the 2007/08 close season, he had been training with Scottish Premier League team St Mirren and a one-year loan deal was eventually agreed with them. On 10 August 2007 St Mirren received international clearance to finalise the deal to bring Miranda to the club. Miranda scored on his debut, opening goal of a 2‚Äì1 win against Inverness. On 2 September 2007, Miranda scored the only goal for St Mirren in a match against Celtic but scored an own goal as the club was defeated 5‚Äì1 heavily. The next game could have been more worse for Miranda when he was sent off for second bookable offense in a 2‚Äì0 loss against Dundee United. But after a fine season with the Buddies, his loan spell was extended by a further season in June 2008. Miranda would score twice against Hamilton and Rangers respectively. Miranda's last St Mirren game was a 3‚Äì2 defeat against Dundee United at Tannadice in January 2009. Shortly after this game Miranda suffered a knee injury which ended his season and he then left the Buddies in July 2009 to return to Argentina, where he signed for newly promoted Chacarita Juniors. During his time at St.Mirren, Miranda remains a popular figure at the club and became a regular player, playing in the left back position. At Chacarita Juniors, Miranda just made 6 appearance and at the end of the 2009/10 season he moved on to Argentine Second Division club Independiente Rivadavia, however it appears that he suffered a setback in passing a medical.

Sibley is best remembered as five-term member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Biography =Early years= Joseph Crocker Sibley, Jr., known to his family and friends as \\"Joe,\\" was born in Friendship, Allegheny County, New York on February 18, 1850.\\"Joseph C. Sibley,\\" in Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-date. His father, Joseph Crocker Sibley, Sr., was a medical doctor; his mother, the former Lucy Elvira Babcock, was a school teacher in the years before marriage.\\"Joseph C. Sibley's Career One Replete with Activity,\\" News-Herald [Franklin, PA], vol. 49, no. 10,409 (May 19, 1926), pg. 11. His parents instilled a love of reading in him at a young age and he read precociously from the age of 6, quickly tackling books intended for a more advanced readership. In 1859 the Sibley family moved to Boston, a small town located in Erie County, New York. Joe attended the county schools and the local academies in the New York communities of Springville and Friendship. Sibley's father died in 1866, spelling the end of his student days a year or two later. His bookish nature made Sibley a natural choice to work as had his mother as a school teacher, but he taught for only one year before leaving the profession. He took a job as a clerk in a dry goods store and harbored the dream of going to college to become a physician, going so far as to study medical books in his spare time. Sibley ultimately decided against this course of action, however. In March 1870, Sibley married the former Metta E. Babcock, also hailing from the town of Friendship. The couple would remain married for over 40 years, raising two daughters together, with Metta dying on July 26, 1911. =Business career= Sibley determined to enter the oil-refining business and by 1873 he had managed to develop a new specialized product, a signal oil for railway use with superior illuminating property to the lighting oils then being used in the industry. He launched a company to manufacture and market this product, the Signal Oil Works. Sibley continued to innovate with petroleum refining and later developed a highly successful oil for valve lubrication. In 1882 Miller and Sibley went into the livestock breeding business, launching a company called Miller & Sibley. The firm proved successful, gaining recognition in the breeding of horses and cattle. Race trotters were a particular specialty for the company, with Miller & Sibley owning as many as 250 head at the company's high point, some of which were worth thousands of dollars. In 1902 Sibley formed a new venture in partnership with his brother-in-law Charles Miller, the Galena-Signal Oil Company. This venture proved successful, and Sibley and Miller became wealthy as a result. Galena Oil later became part of the Standard Oil combine, and then part of the corporations now known as Texaco and Valvoline. =Political career= Sibley launched a political career at an early age, winning election as mayor of Franklin, Pennsylvania, in 1879 at the age of 29. The election of 1892 marked Sibley's entrance onto the national political stage. He was initially nominated for Congress by the Prohibition Party, who expected that the Democratic Party would soon follow suit by nominating him as their candidate in that district.William P.F. Ferguson, \\"Joseph Crocker Sibley,\\" News-Herald [Franklin, PA], vol. 14, whole no. 14,910 (May 24, 1926), pg. 11. Although not a total abstainer from alcohol, the newcomer Sibley won the respect of the Democratic establishment for his political courage by pointedly refusing to drink at a private banquet hosted by local brewers in the district, declaring that \\"I have been trusted by the Prohibitionists with their nomination, and I will not be false to the confidence which they have placed in me, not even in secret and not even as the price of a seat in the House of Representatives.\\" The Democratic Party nominated Sibley nonetheless as its candidate in the 26th Congressional District, as did the People's Party. Sibley proved to be an indefatigable campaigner in his first race for office, delivering as many as six speeches in a single day and developing strong oratorical ability. A local newspaper in a laudatory biography published after his death recalled that > It was at once recognized that he was a reasoner, a wit, a man of affairs, > an orator, and best of all, a strong, courageous man with a big heart and > helpful impulses.... The election returns showed that he had not only > overcome the big hostile majority with which at the start he had been > handicapped, but also that he had piled up for himself the surprising > plurality of 3,387 over his principal competitor... Sibley's upset victory in November 1892 won him a place in the Fifty-third Congress. In Washington the freshman Congressman emerged as a leading critic of the gold standard and advocate of unlimited coinage of silver.See, for example, his published speech of August 18, 1893: Speech of Hon. Joseph C. Sibley, of Pennsylvania, in the House of Representatives, August 18, 1893. Washington, DC: George R. Gray, 1893; passim. Sibley was also an advocate of depoliticizing the tariff question and an early advocate of a constitutional change which would have limited the President of the United States to a single 6-year term of office. Joe Sibley's \\"River Ridge Farm\\" in 2009. Apparent slope of the roof is an optical illusion generated by a wide-angle lens. He was the unsuccessful candidate of the Democratic and People's Parties for reelection in 1894, failing to win once again in the election of 1896. Sibley managed to win his second of five terms in Congress as a Democrat in November 1898, becoming a member of the Fifty-sixth Congress. In 1900 Sibley switched his allegiance to the Republican Party and in November was elected as a Republican to the 57th United States Congress. He would gain reelection in 1902 and 1904 to the Fifty-eighth, and Fifty-ninth Congresses, respectively. He served as chairman of the House Committee on Manufactures during the Fifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth Congresses. He declined renomination in 1906, however, opting to return to private life. A return to politics was planned for 1910, when Sibley was nominated once again for Congress, running for what would have been his sixth term in Washington. His plan was short-circuited by a severe heart attack in that year, however, leaving Sibley unable to campaign and he was forced to resign the nomination, thereby effectively ending his political career. =Death and legacy= During his later years, Sibley resumed his former manufacturing and agricultural pursuits at his well-known estate, \\"River Ridge Farm,\\" located near Franklin, Pennsylvania. He was remarried in December 1913 to the former Ida Rew of Franklin, Pennsylvania. His health began to decline further during the middle 1920s, with Sibley suffering a stroke in 1925. On the morning of May 19, 1926 at 9:10 am while at home at River Ridge, Sibley was stricken by a massive heart attack.\\"Joseph C. Sibley Dies Suddenly at River Ridge Farm,\\" News-Herald [Franklin, PA], vol. 49, no. 10,409 (May 19, 1926), pg. 1. Sibley died instantly from this cardiac event; he was 76 years old at the time of his death. A large funeral service was held for Sibley at the First Baptist Church of Franklin, with four ministers helping to conduct the ceremony and a local newspaper publisher delivering the eulogy, in accordance with Sibley's specific request.\\"Funeral Large, Yet Marked by Great Simplicity,\\" News-Herald [Franklin, PA], vol. 14, whole no. 14,910 (May 24, 1926), pg. 11.

The party was founded in 1918 by disgruntled members of the Party of the Right.Thewes (2003), p. 91 The most prominent of the founders was Pierre Pr√ºm, who was appointed the party's leader. The constitutional amendments of 1919 introduced universal suffrage and proportional representation, strengthening the new populists' chance of winning both votes and seats. In the first election after the reforms, the party won three seats (out of 48) in the Chamber of Deputies, finishing a distant fourth; the dominant Party of the Right won 27 seats, allowing it to form the only stand-alone government in Luxembourgian history. In the election of 1922, the PNI increased its share to four seats, but fell back to three in the 1925 election. More importantly, the Party of the Right fell below the 50% threshold, allowing the other parties to form a broad-based coalition against the conservatives. The coalition relied upon almost all minor parties giving their support to pass measures of confidence, but included members of only three party lists: the Independent National Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Independent Left.Thewes (2003), p. 89 The head of the coalition was the leader of the PNI, Pr√ºm, even though the party was only the joint- fourth largest party in the Chamber of Deputies. In 1926, the government attempted to reward the support offered by the Socialist Party by improving minimum working conditions. However, this was opposed by the Radical Socialists, a party that was born from the Liberal League and maintained its predecessor's support for business and the middle classes. In opposition, the Radical Socialists withdrew their support from the coalition, leaving the government short of a majority. To avoid a humiliating motion of no confidence, Pr√ºm offered his resignation on 22 June,Thewes (2003), p. 90 and left politics to become a judge. At the next election, without Pr√ºm, the PNI's share of the vote was slashed, and the party won only one seat. In the 1931 election, the party lost that solitary seat, and was dissolved. Many of the Independent National Party's members, including Pr√ºm, would later become associated with the Volksdeutsche Bewegung: a collaborationist Nazi party that governed during the German occupation.

He also has played with Australian indie-punk bands Dune Rats and Skegss. Biography Originally from Cronulla in the Sutherland Shire of Sydney, Brad grew up playing piano. His mother was a classical piano player. After learning guitar and bass, he began playing in Sydney band D'Arcy. After meeting Vines guitarist Ryan Griffiths at a house party that D'Arcy played, Heald was invited to try out for The Vines.

He joined the band in July, making his first appearance with the band at Splendour in the Grass, followed by an appearance at Reading and Leads festival. His debut album with the group was Melodia, released in 2008. By November 2008, The Vines' vocalist and lead guitarist, Craig Nicholls, was debilitated by his Asperger's syndrome and the band's tour was cancelled. In December 2008, Heald joined Red Riders as their new lead guitarist, and in February 2009 started recording their next album. The album, Drown in Colour, was released in 2009. After Red Riders disbanded in 2011, Heald returned to playing with The Vines; releasing the album Future Primitive later that year. Heald quietly departed from the band in 2012, having stayed on as a member for a remainder of festival commitments following the departure of Griffith and drummer Hamish Rosser. He then went on to play on tour with indie punk band Dune Rats in 2012; whom he had originally met on tour with The Vines.

Niko Puciƒá was an important politician and Pan- Slavic nationalist. The family today The family still exists in Dubrovnik, but it is not the old pure aristocracy anymore. Eugenia \\"Stane\\" Pozza - Sorgo married a commoner, Bo≈æo Koprivica in 1972, nephew of Niko Koprivica, noted Yugoslav diplomat, royal ambassador of Yugoslavia to the Holy See, knight of the Order of Pope Gregory the Great and wartime Mayor of Dubrovnik. He was killed by the partisans in October 1944 on the island of Daksa. Two of Eugenia's brothers also married commoners, so the rule of \\"Old Blood\\" does not imply anymore on the surviving members of the family. With these three marriages the family stopped practicing centuries old practice of inbreeding, mainly marrying first cousins and uncles and nieces. These marriages were approved by the local Roman Catholic Church because the family was very powerful and influential. It is noted that members of the family tend to have certain taste for Latin and Ancient Greek, having eight generations of classical philologists.

It was first broadcast on 8 October 1991. Synopsis During a night at the fair to celebrate the pair inheriting ¬£600, Richie receives a curse from a gypsy fortune teller. Plot Eddie and Richie are preparing for a visit from Richie's wealthy auntie, Olga. To create the impression of poverty they have killed their goldfish, 'Elvis', to make her believe they have no food left in the house; scattered bills strategically around the house so that she sees one wherever she sits; and Eddie has sprinkled water everywhere to make it look like they've been crying a lot. When Richie phones to ensure she brings her cheque book, he is informed by her servant she has died and left him ¬£600 in her will. Overjoyed, Richie safely ensconces ¬£300 on top of the bathroom cabinet where he believes no one will ever find it, and the duo take the remaining ¬£300 down to the funfair where Eddie causes ¬£45 worth of damage to a shooting stall. Richie agrees to settle the debt only to discover that his wallet and the ¬£300 have been stolen. In a bid to escape, Eddie asks the proprietor of the shooting stall (Mark Arden) to call it double or quits if he can shoot a particular target, however instead he deliberately shoots him in the eye so they can make their getaway. Being chased through the funfair by the workers, the two hide first in the house of horrors and then in the fortune teller's tent. Here the old fortune teller (Liz Smith) reveals to Richie that she knows his driving licence to be a fake and then describes his \\"secret love picture\\". Convinced that the old woman has something (which Eddie believes to be dropsy) he asks her to tell his fortune and she reveals that before the moon rises three times, he will die. Richie rushes to the hospital, where, after causing much havoc with the nurse (Helen Lederer) and the patients, he is granted a clean bill of health by Sir Roger Cobham (Roger Brierley), a famous heart surgeon, who kicks him out immediately afterward. Richie is relieved, but on the way out he and Eddie accidentally push an old man (Nick Gillard) down a lift shaft. Richie then comes to the conclusion that his death will be caused by an incident. Three days later, Richie has created a bunker and has not left it for three days and nights nor has he eaten anything, as he has enlisted Eddie to test all of the food and drink. Eddie has taken this task to heart, especially when testing alcohol. After bribing Eddie to check if the moon has risen yet, Richie notices that the ceiling above him is sagging, and Eddie explains that it's his piano. Richie makes him go upstairs and move it. Richie prays that whatever fate awaits him be given instead to Eddie. His prayer is repeatedly interrupted by Eddie playing piano and just as Richie gets up to order Eddie to come down at once, Eddie and the piano crash through the ceiling, destroying Richie's bunker. It's only at this moment that Richie realises that everything that transpired leading him to get the curse was because of Eddie and suggested they hide in the fortune teller's tent. Realising that Eddie could be the cause of his death, Richie throws him out of the flat. That night, as Richie is visited by the Grim Reaper, who informs him that he is going to hell. Richie pleads for his life, failing to notice that Death seems to have trouble with his mobility. It is revealed to the audience that Death is in fact Eddie on stilts in a robe. Richie offers to play chess for his soul but 'Death' refuses, claiming he doesn't know the rules. He also refuses to play Cluedo because Richie always looks at the mystery cards. Eventually, Richie beats 'Death' in a game of I spy. 'Death' agrees to allow Richie to live in return for Eddie's return to the flat; the remaining ¬£300. While Richie and Eddie argue, the shooting-gallery stallholder kicks the door down looking for Richie, as he has come to return his missing wallet. They realise that it was the fortune teller who stole Richie's wallet, and therefore knew of its contents - the forged driving licence and Julia Somerville nude collage. The Stallholder takes the ¬£300 to pay for his eye operation and Richie's girly world magazine, as the stallholder is about to leave, Richie asks him if he would like to kick Eddie in the bollocks which he gladly does. DVD edit DVD releases of this episode have had an audio edit from the original television broadcast. At the funfair when Richie realises that his wallet is missing, he originally called the fair staff \\"thieving bastard gypos\\" (a derogatory nickname from \\"gypsies\\", i.e., Romani). In the DVD releases the word \\"gypos\\" has been replaced with \\"yobbos\\". However, the scene selection chapter is still entitled \\"gypos\\". This edit had already been made by the time of the repeat broadcast on BBC2 on 10 July 1992, which contains the word \\"yobbos\\".

Detail is shown for the first 24 seconds of the 37-second recording of humpback whale song. The ethereal whale songs and echolocation clicks are visible as horizontal striations and vertical sweeps respectively. Spectrogram generated with Fatpigdog's PC based Real Time FFT Spectrum Analyzer. Whale vocalizations are the sounds made by whales to communicate. The word \\"song\\" is used in particular to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales (notably the humpback) in a way that is reminiscent of human singing. Humans produce sound by expelling air through the larynx. The vocal cords within the larynx open and close as necessary to separate the stream of air into discrete pockets of air. These pockets are shaped by the throat, tongue, and lips into the desired sound. Cetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans: the Odontoceti (toothed whales--including dolphins) and the Mysticeti (baleen whales--including the largest whales, such as the blue whale). __TOC__  Blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus)  Estimates made by Cummings and Thompson (1971) and Richardson et al. (1995) suggest that source level of sounds made by blue whales are between 155 and 188 decibels when measured at a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre. All blue whale groups make calls at a fundamental frequency of between 10 and 40 Hz, and the lowest frequency sound a human can typically perceive is 20 Hz. Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds. Additionally blue whales off the coast of Sri Lanka have been recorded repeatedly making \\"songs\\" of four notes duration lasting about two minutes each, reminiscent of the well-known humpback whale songs. All of the baleen whale sound files on this page (with the exception of the humpback vocalizations) are reproduced at 10x speed to bring the sound into the human auditory band.  Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus)  Like other whales, the male fin whale has been observed to make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept infrasonic pulses from 16 to 40 hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz). Each sound lasts between one and two seconds, and various combinations of sounds occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. These sequences are then repeated in bouts lasting up to many days.  Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae)  The humpback whale is well known for its long and complex song. Humpbacks repeat patterns of low notes that vary in amplitude and frequency in consistent patterns over a period of hours or even days. Only male humpbacks sing, so it was at first assumed that the songs were solely for courting. While the primary purpose of whale song may be to attract females, it is almost certain that whale song serves myriad purposes.  Orca (killer whale) (Orcinus orca) As with other dolphins, orcas are very vocal animals. They produce a variety of clicks and whistles that are used for communication and echolocation. The vocalization types vary with activity. While resting they are much quieter, merely emitting an occasional call that is distinct from those heard when engaging in more active behaviour. Fish- eating resident groups of orcas in the Northeast Pacific tend to be much more vocal than transient groups living in the same waters. Scientists surmise that the main reason for this lies in the different hearing abilities of their prey. Resident killer whales feed on fish, particularly Pacific salmon, a prey with poor underwater hearing that cannot detect killer whale calls at any significant distance. Transient orcas on the other hand feed mainly on marine mammals (primarily seals, sea lions, porpoises and dolphins) and occasionally on seabirds. Because all marine mammals have excellent underwater hearing, transients probably remain silent for much of the time to avoid detection by their acoustically-sensitive prey. For the same reason, mammal-hunting orcas tend to restrict their echolocation, occasionally using just a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations.

It was the successor of the Houli culture (6500‚Äì5500 BC) and precursor of the Dawenkou culture (4100‚Äì2600 BC). The type site at Beixin was discovered in Tengzhou, Shandong, China. The site was excavated from 1978 to 1979. Excavation findings Fifty sites from the culture were discovered, located in central and southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu provinces. These show evidence of millet cultivation and water buffalo, pig, and chicken domestication. The Beixin people fished for carp in the nearby river, hunted deer, and foraged for wild pears, roots and tubers. They made extensive use of hemp fibers to weave fabric for clothing, to make baskets, and for various forms of thread, twine and rope, including their fishing nets. There is no evidence of hemp cultivation, but it grew wild in great abundance throughout the region. Small quantities of hemp seeds have been recovered, but archaeologists believe these were acquired as a food source rather than for planting. Houses tended to be semi-subterranean and circular in shape. The Beixin people had separate housing and burial areas in the settlements, which was common for early Neolithic cultures. The houses and burial areas were clustered in small groups, which indicated a family or clan social structure in both life and death. Tools, weapons, and other articles buried with the dead as burial offerings, in the more recent gravesites, indicated development of a type of early ceremonial burial. Examination of the remains indicates steady population growth over the history of the Beixin people, as well as a steady increase in lifespan, which suggests improvements in nutrition and health. Chemical analysis of the abundant pottery shards found at the sites indicates that pork and millet were the staples of the Beixin diet, supplemented by venison, chicken, eggs, and a plentiful assortment of fruits and vegetables. This represents a broadly varied and very nutritious diet by Neolithic standards. Violent death, as revealed by examination of the remains, was relatively uncommon among the Beixin people compared with other Neolithic cultures. Death was almost always attributed to disease or the results of old age. This indicates that the Beixin were a peaceful culture, and not troubled by internal strife or conflicts with neighboring cultures. Artifacts Typical artifacts from the Beixin culture include stone axe heads, spearheads and arrowheads from hunting weapons, and stone sickle blades used to harvest grain.

She was two years his senior. Life =Family background= Empress Xiaozheyi's personal name was not recorded in history. Her family originally belonged to the Mongol Plain Blue Banner. * Father: Chongqi (; 1829‚Äì1900), the top candidate in the 1865 imperial examination, served as a fourth rank literary official () in the Hanlin Academy, the Minister of Revenue from 1884‚Äì1886 and in 1900 and the Minister of Personnel in 1886, and held the title of a third class duke ()  Paternal grandfather: Sai≈°angga (; 1794‚Äì1875), served as the Minister of Works from 1841‚Äì1845  Paternal grandmother: Lady Fuca  Paternal aunt: Imperial Noble Consort Gongsu (1857‚Äì1921) * Mother: Lady Aisin Gioro  Maternal grandfather: Duanhua (1807‚Äì1861), held the title Prince Zheng of the First Rank from 1846‚Äì1861  Maternal grandmother: Lady Niohuru, Empress Xiaozhenxian's aunt  Maternal great aunt: Lady Aisin Gioro, the mother of Empress Xiaodexian (1831‚Äì1850) * One brother =Xianfeng era= The future Empress Xiaozheyi was born on the first day of the seventh lunar month in the fourth year of the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor, which translates to 25 July 1854 in the Gregorian calendar. Lady Arute was tutored by her father since young and she demonstrated high potential and intelligence as a child. She also showed interest and talent in poetry, literature, music and art. Under the tutelage of her father, she learned to write with both hands. She was famous among the Manchu aristocracy for her talent, moral character and looks. =Tongzhi era= In 1872, Lady Arute was chosen to be Empress by the Tongzhi Emperor. She was specially chosen to help in the reconciliation of rivals in the Qing imperial court. Lady Arute's maternal grandfather, Duanhua, was a former political rival of the emperor's mother, Empress Dowager Cixi. It was said that there was an argument between the Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci'an over the choice of empress. Ci'an, who favored Lady Arute, claimed that the empress should possess high moral standards, while Cixi felt that the empress should be wise and shrewd. The conflict was resolved by the Tongzhi Emperor when he eventually chose Lady Arute to be his Empress. Cixi was displeased with her son's decision. Another four candidates chosen became the emperor's concubines. One of them was Lady Arute's aunt, the future Imperial Noble Consort Gongsu. Empress Dowager Cixi once complained about Lady Arute: > \\"We made a mistake in selecting a wife for him. How could we tell that her > beauty was false? She was very beautiful, but she hated us.\\"Derling, > Imperial insence, 1934, P. 161. On the night of 15 October 1872, at around 11:30 pm (an auspicious hour recommended by imperial astrologers), Lady Arute left her family residence for the Forbidden City. Her furniture ‚Äì a bed, a mirror, two wardrobes, chairs and eight marriage chests ‚Äì had symbolically preceded her.Maria Warner\\", \\"The Dragon Empres\\": Life and Times of Tz'u-Hsi, 1835‚Äì1908, Empress of China\\", P. 121. After their marriage, the Tongzhi Emperor evidently preferred his empress over his four other consorts, spending almost every night with her, while the four consorts waited in vain for the emperor to summon them. Empress Dowager Cixi was unhappy about the unfair treatment of the emperor's other consorts and she turned hostile towards the empress. She warned the empress that, as empress, she should allow the emperor to spend time equally among his consorts, and to not seize him for herself. Cixi also reminded the empress that since both she and the Tongzhi Emperor were still young, they should spend more time learning how to govern the country. When she saw no signs of change in her son's attitude, Cixi eventually ordered the emperor and empress to be separated, so that they could focus more on learning how to become ruling sovereigns. The Tongzhi Emperor could not cope well with loneliness so he grew more ill-tempered over time. Once, a eunuch secretly suggested to the emperor to sneak out of the Forbidden City and visit brothels. As a result, it was assumed that the emperor contracted syphilis. Empress Dowager Cixi regarded this incident as a humiliating scandal, so she warned the imperial physicians to remain silent about it. The physicians lied that the emperor was ill with smallpox and prescribed medicine and treatment for smallpox. A court official, Yun Yuting, wrote in his memoirs that the empress visited the Tongzhi Emperor on his sickbed while he complained about his mother's interfering and domineering ways. She was looking forward to the day the emperor recovered and they could live and rule together. Empress Dowager Cixi, tipped off by eunuchs, entered the room in stockinged feet, and hearing the empress's criticisms, flew into a rage and rampaged through the room, seized the empress by the hair and hit her, shouting that by making love to the emperor she would cause him to be ill again. She ordered the eunuchs to take her away and slap her on the face.Maria Warner\\", \\"The Dragon Empress\\": Life and Times of Tz'u-Hsi, 1835‚Äì1908, Empress of China\\", P. 125. =Guangxu era= The Tongzhi Emperor died on 12 January 1875. Some sources claim that the empress was pregnant at the time.Maria Warner\\", \\"The Dragon Empress\\": Life and Times of Tz'u-Hsi, 1835‚Äì1908, Empress of China\\", P. 126. The Tongzhi Emperor had not chosen a successor before his death, so it was up to Empress Dowager Cixi to decide who would be the new emperor. Cixi chose her nephew Zaitian, who was enthroned as the Guangxu Emperor. The empress was not mentioned in the crisis over the succession. Neither was she granted the title of Empress Dowager, which was customary after the death of an emperor. She received the title \\"Empress Jiashun\\" instead. Within 100 days of the death of the Tongzhi Emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi pushed the blame of the emperor's death on the empress. She ordered the empress's food rations to be reduced. The empress wrote a letter to her father asking for help, but his reply was simply, \\"Your Highness knows what to do.\\" It was said that the empress committed suicide but official court records state that she died after a long and serious illness. Empress Dowager Cixi granted her the posthumous title \\"Empress Xiaozheyi\\". In 1876, a censor to the throne wrote that the empress should be posthumously honored for being a virtuous wife who had committed suicide after her husband's death. Empress Dowager Cixi rebuked him curtly for writing a memorial for suggesting an unnatural death.Hummel, Arthur William, ed. Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period (1644‚Äì1912), P. 731. In 1900, when the Eight- Nation Alliance invaded Beijing, Empress Dowager Cixi asked the Empress's father, Chongqi, to remain behind and take charge of state affairs. Chongqi and his family committed suicide after the capital fell to the foreigners.Draft history of the Qing dynasty, part 255.„ÄäÊ∏ÖÂè≤Á®ø¬∑Âàó‰º†‰∫åÁôæ‰∫îÂçÅ‰∫î Titles * During the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor (r. 1850‚Äì1861):  Lady Arute (from 25 July 1854) * During the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor (r. 1861‚Äì1875):  Empress (; from 15 October 1872ÂêåÊ≤ªÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ‰πùÊúà ÂçÅÂõõÊó•) * During the reign of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1875‚Äì1908):  Empress Jiashun (; from 12 January 1875ÂêåÊ≤ªÂçÅ‰∏âÂπ¥ ÂçÅ‰∫åÊúà ‰∫îÊó•)  Empress Xiaozheyi (; from June/July 1875ÂÖâÁ∑íÂÖÉÂπ¥ ‰∫îÊúà) In fiction and popular culture * Portrayed by Lee Ching in The Rise and Fall of Qing Dynasty (1990) * Portrayed by Mi Yang in Sigh of His Highness (2006) * Portrayed by Natalie Tong in The Confidant (2012) See also * Ranks of imperial consorts in China#Qing * Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty Notes References * Draft history of the Qing dynasty. „ÄäÊ∏ÖÂè≤Á®ø„ÄãÂç∑‰∫åÁôæÂçÅÂõõÔºéÂàóÂÇ≥‰∏ÄÔºéÂêéÂ¶ÉÂÇ≥Ôºé * Royal archives of the Qing dynasty (Ê∏ÖÂÆ´Ê°£Ê°à). * Qing imperial genealogy(Ê∏ÖÁöáÂÆ§ÂõõË∞±). * Biographies of the Qing dynasty consorts (Ê∏ÖÂéÜÊúùÂêéÂ¶ÉÂàó‰º†). * Sterling Seagraves, \\"Dragon Lady\\" . * Maria Warner\\", \\"The Dragon Empres\\": Life and Times of Tz'u-Hsi, 1835‚Äì1908, Empress of China\\". . * Daily life in the Forbidden City, Wan Yi, Wang Shuqing, Lu Yanzhen. . * Hummel, Arthur William, ed.

Description This substantial but relatively neglected piece has affinities with the slow movements of both the String Quintet in C major D. 956, and the Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat, D 898. Completed in the Autumn of 1827, it is possibly a rejected slow movement of the Piano Trio No. 1. It has the sublime slowness of the string quintet movement (in one recording of the Notturno, by the Beaux Arts Trio, Schubert takes half a minute to leave the opening tonic harmony), together with a similar use of pizzicato at various points, and with the same paradoxical effect: the pizzicato decorations of the main tune seem to enhance the underlying tragedy of the music, rather than lightening it. The main thematic idea has a characteristic common to a number of Schubert‚Äôs most celebrated melodic ideas, including the second subjects of both the C major string quintet‚Äôs first movement and the ‚ÄòUnfinished‚Äô Symphony No. 8's first movement: that of ‚Äònot going anywhere‚Äô, pitch-wise, but seeming to revolve round a single note (the third note of the scale in this case). Formal structure The Notturno is in extended ternary form (ABABA). The first episode is in the 'Neapolitan' key, the flattened supertonic major (theoretically F flat, but written as E major). The main melodic idea of the episode is a three-note, dotted figure, which has an almost martial, march-like quality, despite the continued slowness of the music‚Äôs underlying tempo, thus providing a contrast with the opening section while not disturbing the unity of the piece. The second episode repeats the material of the first episode, but in the submediant major (C major). The transition back to the opening material at the end of both episodes incorporates a long dominant preparation. The first of these transitions starts in F major, the key in which the first episode has ended, and progresses by a series of modulations to the home key of E flat, anchored by a bass line descending largely by step. The second transition is tonally unnecessary, in the sense that the episode has already landed back on the tonic, E flat, with an emphatic cadence; but Schubert disguises this fact by carrying out a feint towards F major again, the key in which the first episode had ended. This excursion Schubert uses as an opportunity for further harmonic progressions. In its third and final appearance the opening tune is decorated with trills in the upper register of the piano. Use in the media The Notturno was used intermittently in the background during BBC Radio 4‚Äôs July 2008 serialisation of Henry James‚Äôs The Portrait of a Lady. It is also played during the end scene of the film Shall We Kiss?, as well as in some episodes of the third season of the American television series Hannibal.

It has 45 specialty tea shops in France, Japan, Israel, Ireland, Norway, Belgium and Germany. The company specializes in direct tea sourcing and commercialization of more than 200 teas as well as tea gifts and accessories.  History = Origins = Fran√ßois-Xavier Delmas founded Palais des Th√©s in 1987. His goal was to democratize tea and help the Occident to learn more about its cultural and gastronomical aspects. The first shop opens in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.  Palais des Th√©s shops  Most of Palais des Th√©s shops include three spaces: the tea wall where 100+ teas are available in bulk, a gift section and a third section dedicated to the tea accessories (including teapots, cups, strainers, etc.). In 1991, Palais des Th√©s opened its first store outside of France, in Tokyo. Palais des Th√©s then opened new shops in Brussels (2001 and 2007), Oslo (2006 and 2007), Dublin (2008), Ljubljana (2009) and Tel-Aviv (2010).  Palais des Th√©s USA  In 2011, Aurelie Pasquet and Cyrille Bessiere launched Palais des Th√©s in the USA. In March 2016, they opened \\"L'Appartement\\" in the heart of SoHo, NYC (107 Spring Street New York NY 10012) where tea enthusiasts can attend tea classes and taste more than 150 teas. Part of \\"L'Appartement\\" is used as a showroom to display the brand's latest collections to exclusive retailers. In the US, Palais des Th√©s partners with retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's and Dean & Deluca, high-end hotels including The Plaza Hotel in New York, The Saint Regis (New York and Washington), Viceroy Beverly Hills, The Peninsula and The Surrey Hotel as well as fine dining including Eleven Madison Park and Gabriel Kreuther.  The Tea School  = Sharing knowledge and transmitting: the founding principles = The Tea School was created in 1999, 13 years after the first Palais des Th√©s shop. Fran√ßois-Xavier Delmas learned the tea business in the gardens and plantations, while talking to farmers and small producers. His travels took him to increasingly remote tea producing regions, providing him with exceptional experiences and discoveries, as well as images and words. Valuable relations were formed with artisan tea producers, and Fran√ßois-Xavier gradually built up a unique and extensive knowledge derived from many different sources. Convinced that Palais des Th√©s‚Äô role was to share this knowledge with customers, he decided with Mathias Minet to create the Tea School. Initially set up in a small room in the Marais district of Paris, the first classes were attended by around ten students who would taste a variety of teas. There were two objectives: to impart knowledge of what takes place on the plantations, and to teach the art of tasting tea. Today the curriculum which is placing the emphasis on sensorial experience and hands-on tasting is also founded on an original pedagogical method. With The Tea School going from strength to strength and to fulfill the demands of an ever-wider public, Palais des Th√©s has created a new venue in 2008: a 200m¬≤ loft-style flat entirely devoted to tea expertise, in the heart of the 11th arrondissement of Paris. In 2016, Palais des Th√©s opened a tea school at 107 Spring St. in New York City. Located in one of the oldest buildings in SoHo, the tea school is part of \\"L'Appartement\\", a multi-usage concept dedicated to the world of tea.

The New York Rangers experienced early success, winning the Stanley Cup in only their second season of existence, and would go on to win two more in the next 12 years. After their Stanley Cup win in 1940, the Rangers then suffered through one of the longest championship droughts in NHL history, which became known as the Curse of 1940. The 54-year drought ended with a Stanley Cup win in 1994 by a team led by captain Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, Adam Graves and Mike Richter, all of whose numbers have since been retired by the team. Early years and the Original Six era (1926‚Äì1967) In 1925, the New York Americans joined the NHL, playing in Madison Square Garden. The \\"Amerks\\" proved to be a greater success than expected, leading Garden president Tex Rickard to seek his own franchise for the Garden, despite promising the Amerks they would be the only hockey team to play there. Tex Rickard, president of Madison Square Garden, was awarded the Rangers in 1926. Tex Rickard was granted a franchise, which he originally planned to name the \\"New York Giants\\". By the time the franchise was granted in April 1926, the name \\"New York Rangers Professional Hockey Club\\" was the official name. The origin of the name Rangers, as in \\"Tex's Rangers\\", is variously attributed to Rickard himself or the New York press. Rickard managed to get future legendary Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe to assemble the team. At the time, there was no expansion draft in the NHL to help new teams ice competitive rosters, which in any other year would have made assembling a playoff contender extremely difficult. However, 1926 also happened to be the year the NHL's last major rival of its early era (the Western Hockey League) went out of business, so there was an abundance of top-caliber hockey talent searching for new clubs. The owners of the Rangers' expansion cousins (the Detroit Cougars and Chicago Black Hawks) opted to purchase entire WHL rosters (the Victoria Cougars and Portland Rosebuds respectively) to stock their teams. Smythe eschewed this approach, opting instead to sign who he felt were the best players from the remaining four WHL teams as well as a few NHL castaways he felt the other teams had misjudged. Smythe had a falling-out with Rickard's hockey man, Col. John S. Hammond, and was fired as manager-head coach on the eve of the first season; he was paid a then-hefty $10,000 to leave.Smythe and Young, pp. 84-85 Smythe was replaced by Pacific Coast Hockey Association co- founder Lester Patrick, who kept all of the players Smythe had assembled. Smythe's approach to building the team paid quick dividends, as Rangers turned out to be a winner. The Rangers won the American Division title their first year, but lost to the Boston Bruins in the playoffs. The team's early success led to players becoming minor celebrities and fixtures in New York City's \\"Roaring Twenties\\" nightlife. It was also during this time, playing at the Garden on 48th Street, blocks away from Times Square, the Rangers obtained their now-famous nickname \\"The Broadway Blueshirts\\". In only their second season, the Rangers won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Montreal Maroons three games to two. One of the most memorable stories that emerged from the Finals involved Patrick playing in goal at age 44. At the time, teams were not required to dress a backup goaltender, so when the Rangers' starting goaltender Lorne Chabot left a game with an eye injury, Maroons head coach Eddie Gerard vetoed his original choice for a replacement (who was Alex Connell, another NHL goaltender of the old Ottawa Senators who was in attendance for the game). An angry Patrick lined up between the pipes for two periods in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals, allowing one goal to Maroons center Nels Stewart. Frank Boucher would score the game-winning goal in overtime for New York. An expansion team would not come this far this fast in North American professional sports until the Philadelphia Atoms won the North American Soccer League title in their first year of existence. =1930s= line. Consisting of Bill Cook, Bun Cook and Frank Boucher, they played together from 1926 to 1937. After a loss to the Boston Bruins in the 1928‚Äì29 finals and a few mediocre seasons in the early 1930s, the Rangers, led by brothers Bill and Bun Cook on the right and left wings, respectively, and Frank Boucher at center, would defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1932‚Äì33 best-of-five finals, three games to one, to win their second Stanley Cup, exacting revenge on the Leafs' \\"Kid line\\" of Busher Jackson, Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher. The Rangers would spend the rest of the 1930s playing close to .500 hockey until their next Stanley Cup win. Lester Patrick stepped down as head coach and was replaced by Frank Boucher. In 1939‚Äì40, the Rangers finished the regular season in second place behind the Boston Bruins. The two teams would meet in the first round of the playoffs. The Bruins gained a two- games-to-one series lead from the Rangers until they recovered to win three straight games, defeating the first-place Bruins four games to two. The Rangers' first-round victory gave them a bye until the finals. The Detroit Red Wings disposed of the New York Americans in their first round best-of-three series two games to one (even as the Americans had analytical and notorious ex-Bruins star Eddie Shore) and the Toronto Maple Leafs ousted the Chicago Black Hawks two games to none. The Maple Leafs and Red Wings would play a best-of-three series to determine who would go on to play the Rangers in the Cup Finals. The Maple Leafs swept the Red Wings and the Finals match-up was determined. The 1940 Stanley Cup Finals started in Madison Square Garden in New York. The first two games went to the Rangers. In Game 1, the Rangers needed overtime to gain a 1‚Äì0 series lead, but they won Game 2 more easily with a 6‚Äì2 victory. The series then headed to Toronto where the Maple Leafs won the next two games, tying the series 2‚Äì2. In Games 5 and 6, the Rangers won in overtime, taking the series four games to two to earn their third Stanley Cup. =Original Six era (1942‚Äì1967)= A game between the Rangers and the Montreal Canadiens, 1962. The Rangers would collapse by the mid-1940s, losing games by as much as 15‚Äì0 and having one goaltender with a 6.20 goals against average. They would miss the playoffs for five consecutive seasons before squeaking into the fourth and final playoff spot in 1948. They lost in the first round and would miss the playoffs again in 1949. In the 1950 finals, the Rangers were forced to play all of their games on the road (home games in Toronto) while the circus was at the Garden. They would end up losing to the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the seventh game of the finals, despite a stellar first-round performance as underdogs to the Montreal Canadiens. During this time, Red Wings owner James E. Norris became the largest stockholder in the Garden. However, he did not buy controlling interest in the arena, which would have violated the NHL's rule against one person owning more than one team. Nonetheless, he had enough support on the board of directors to exercise de facto control. Expansion era (1967‚Äì1993) The Rangers missed the playoffs in 12 of the next 16 seasons. However, the team was rejuvenated in the late 1960s, symbolized by moving into a newly-rebuilt Madison Square Garden in 1968. A year earlier, they had made the playoffs for the first time in five years on the strength of rookie goaltender Eddie Giacomin and acquired 1950s Montreal Canadiens star right wing Bernie \\"Boom Boom\\" Geoffrion. The Rangers made the Finals twice in the 1970s, but lost both times to two 1970s powerhouses; in six games to the Boston Bruins in 1972, who were led by such stars as Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge, Johnny Bucyk and Wayne Cashman; and in five games to the Canadiens in 1979, who had Bob Gainey, Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson, Ken Dryden, Guy Lapointe and Serge Savard. This time the Rangers had Esposito, but it didn't matter, as the Canadiens were dominant. Jean Ratelle played with the Rangers from 1960 to 1975, helping the Rangers reach the playoffs during the expansion era. By 1972, the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals despite losing high-scoring center Jean Ratelle (who had been on pace over Bruin Phil Esposito to become the first Ranger since Bryan Hextall in 1942 to lead the NHL in scoring) to injury during the stretch drive of the regular season. The strength of players like Brad Park, Ratelle, Vic Hadfield and Rod Gilbert (the last three constructing the famed \\"GAG line\\", meaning \\"goal-a-game\\") would still carry them through the playoffs. They would defeat the defending-champion Canadiens in the first round and the Chicago Blackhawks in the second, but lost to the Bruins in the finals. The Rangers played a legendary semi-final series against the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1973‚Äì74 playoffs. This series was noted for a Game 7 fight between Dale Rolfe of the Rangers and Dave Schultz of the Flyers. Schultz pummeled Rolfe without anyone on the Rangers lifting a finger to protect him (the GAG line was on the ice at the time). This led to the belief the Rangers of that period were soft, especially when taking into account the bullying endured by the Rangers during the 1972 finals. One example is Gilbert's beating at the hands of Derek Sanderson of the Bruins. Their new rivals, the New York Islanders, who entered the NHL in 1972 after paying a huge territorial fee ‚Äî some $4 million ‚Äî to the Rangers, were their first-round opponent in 1975. After splitting the first two games, the Islanders defeated the more-established Rangers 11 seconds into overtime of the deciding Game 3, establishing a rivalry that continued to grow for years. After some off years in the mid-to-late 1970s, they picked up Esposito and Carol Vadnais from the Bruins for Park, Ratelle, and Joe Zanussi in 1975. Swedish stars Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson jumped to the Rangers from the maverick World Hockey Association (WHA). In 1979, they defeated the surging Islanders in the semi-finals and would return to the finals again before bowing out to the Canadiens. However, the Islanders got their revenge, eliminating the Rangers in four consecutive playoff series starting in 1981 en route to their second of four consecutive Stanley Cup titles. Marcel Dionne with the Rangers, 1987. He signed with the Rangers in the 1986 off-season. The Rangers stayed competitive through the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs each year save for one, but never going very far. An exception was 1985‚Äì86, when the Rangers, behind rookie goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, upended the Patrick Division-winning Flyers in five games followed by a six- game win over the Washington Capitals in the Patrick Division Finals. Montreal disposed of the Rangers in the Wales Conference Finals behind a rookie goaltender of their own, Patrick Roy. The Rangers then acquired superstar center Marcel Dionne after almost 12 years as a Los Angeles King the next year. In 1988, Dionne moved into third place in career goals scored (since bettered by Brett Hull). But Dionne's always-churning legs started to slow the next year, thereby ensuring that his goals came further and further apart. \\"Because you love the game so much, you think it will never end,\\" said Dionne, who spent nine games in the minors before retiring in 1989. He would only play 49 playoff games in 17 seasons with the Rangers, Kings and Detroit Red Wings. The many playoff failures convinced Rangers fans that this was a manifestation of the Curse of 1940, which is said to either have begun when the Rangers management burnt the mortgage to Madison Square Garden in the bowl of the Stanley Cup after the 1940 victory or by Red Dutton following the collapse of the New York Americans franchise. In the early 1980s, Islander fans began chanting \\"1940! 1940!\\" to taunt the Rangers. Fans in other cities soon picked up the chant. Frustration was at its peak when the 1991‚Äì92 squad captured the Presidents' Trophy. They took a 2‚Äì1 series lead on the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins and then faltered in three straight (most observers note a Ron Francis slapshot from the blue line that eluded Mike Richter as the series' turning point). The following year, injuries and a 1‚Äì11 finish landed the Rangers in the cellar of the Patrick Division after being in a playoff position for much of the season. Head coach Roger Neilson did not finish the season. The off-season hiring of controversial head coach Mike Keenan was criticized by many who pointed out Keenan's 0‚Äì3 record in the finals. During this period, the Rangers were owned by Gulf+Western, which was renamed to Paramount Communications in 1989, and sold to Viacom in 1994. Viacom then sold the team to ITT Corporation and Cablevision, and several years later, ITT sold their ownership stake to Cablevision, who still owns the team today Modern era (1993‚Äìpresent) =Stanley Cup: the ending of the curse 1993‚Äì1994= The 1993‚Äì94 season was a successful one for Rangers fans, as Mike Keenan led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup championship in 54 years. Two years prior, they acquired center Mark Messier, who was a part of the Edmonton Oilers' Stanley Cup-winning teams. Adam Graves, who also came from the Oilers, joined the Rangers as well. Other ex-Oilers on the Rangers included Esa Tikkanen and trade deadline acquisitions Oilers captain Craig MacTavish and Glenn Anderson from the Toronto Maple Leafs. Graves would set a team record with 52 goals, breaking the old record of 50 held by Vic Hadfield. This record would later be broken by Jarom√≠r J√°gr on April 8, 2006, against the Boston Bruins. The Rangers clinched the Presidents' Trophy by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 52‚Äì24‚Äì8, setting a franchise record with 112 points. Their winning of the inaugural Atlantic Division title was only one of three times that the division title was not won by two of their biggest rivals, the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Rangers successfully made it past the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the New York Islanders, who were seeded eighth in the first round, and then breezed by the Washington Capitals, seeded seventh, in five. However, matters got interesting in the Conference Finals against the third-seeded New Jersey Devils. The Rangers lost the series opener at home in double overtime, but won the next two games before the Devils beat the New York offense and defeated them 3‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì1. The series headed back to the Meadowlands for the next game, but the day before that sixth game, Rangers captain Mark Messier stepped up and guaranteed a win. Keenan said of the guarantee: In Game 6, Messier rose to the occasion and scored three times in the final period to lead the Rangers to a 4‚Äì2 win and set up a seventh game back at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers won Game 7 2‚Äì1, when Stephane Matteau scored a goal in double overtime, leading the team to the finals for the first time since . Up against the Vancouver Canucks, the Cinderella team from the west, the Rangers again lost the series opener at home in overtime. Brian Leetch hit the crossbar at one end, and the Canucks going down to score the winner at the other on a shot from Greg Adams. The Rangers then bounced back and they won the next three games, allowing the Canucks just four goals. That set the stage for a game-five Stanley Cup celebration at home, the first time the team had ever been in a position to win a Cup at the Garden. That night, the Canucks were leading 3‚Äì0 by the third minute of the third period. Even though the Rangers pulled even by the midway point, Vancouver took the lead 29 seconds later and cruised to a 6‚Äì3 win. New York's parade hopes were given another jolt two nights later when the Canucks put together a 4‚Äì1 win. Keenan said of playing Game 7: Entering Game 7, Keenan became the first person to be a head coach in game sevens of the Stanley Cup Finals for two different teams; Keenan had coached the Flyers in when they lost to the Oilers. Mike Babcock would join him in this feat in while with the Detroit Red Wings, having been with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim when they lost to the Devils in (the home team won all seven games of the series). Game 7 was a classic. The Rangers took a 2‚Äì0 first period lead on goals by Leetch and Graves, but Vancouver captain Trevor Linden scored short-handed to cut the lead. Messier scored later on a power play to put the Rangers up 3‚Äì1. Linden scored a power play goal early in the third, but the Rangers managed to hang on 3‚Äì2 as the Garden erupted in cheers and tears. Mark Messier provided two of the most memorable images of that Stanley Cup Finals that would become iconic images to the Rangers and their fans and in all of hockey: first, jumping up and down like a little kid with overwhelming emotion as ticker tape fell, then, showing incredible emotion as he accepted the Stanley Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, as he became the first (and to this date, the only) player to captain two teams to the Stanley Cup, having been with the Oilers in . This image was taken by George Kalinsky, photographer at Madison Square Garden, and were captured on film. Leetch became the first American-born player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy, the first non-Canadian to win it, and Keenan avoided being the first coach to lose Game 7 Stanley Cup Finals with two teams. However, this unfortunate fate would befall Babcock in 2009 when the Red Wings lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins, in-state rivals of the Flyers. The Rangers winning this Stanley Cup was the highest-rated single CBC Sports program in history to that point (now that distinction belongs to the men's ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the 2002 Winter Olympics, when Canada won its first Olympic ice hockey gold medal since the 1952 Winter Olympics). CBC commentator Bob Cole said Game 7 was one of his most memorable TV games. =Expensive acquisitions (1994‚Äì2004)= Despite having coached the Rangers to a regular season first-place finish and the Stanley Cup, head coach Mike Keenan left after a dispute with general manager Neil Smith. During the 1994‚Äì95 lockout-shortened season, the Rangers struggled to find their form and lost in the second round of the playoffs. They snuck in with the eighth seed and defeated the Quebec Nordiques in the first round, but were swept by Philadelphia in the second round. Succeeding Rangers head coach Colin Campbell orchestrated a deal that sent Sergei Zubov and center Petr Nedved to Pittsburgh in exchange for defenceman Ulf Samuelsson and left winger Luc Robitaille in the summer of 1995. The Rangers acquired Wayne Gretzky as a free agent in the 1996 off-season. The Rangers landed an aging Wayne Gretzky in 1996, but even with The Great One, they would fizzle out. Their 1994 stars were aging and many retired or dropped off in performance. Gretzky's greatest accomplishment was leading them to the 1997 Eastern Conference finals, where they lost 4‚Äì1 to the Eric Lindros-led Philadelphia Flyers. After GM Neil Smith ran Messier, a former Oiler teammate of Gretzky's, out of town in the summer of 1997 and failed in a bid to replace him with Colorado Avalanche superstar Joe Sakic, the Rangers began a streak of seven seasons without making the playoffs, despite routinely having the highest payroll in the NHL. In March 2000, Smith was fired along with head coach John Muckler, and, that summer, James Dolan hired Glen Sather to replace him. By the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season, the Rangers had landed a lot of star power. Mark Messier had returned to New York, Theoren Fleury joined the Rangers after spending most of his career with the Calgary Flames, and Eric Lindros was traded to the Rangers from the Philadelphia Flyers. The Rangers also acquired Pavel Bure late in the 2001‚Äì02 season from the Florida Panthers. It was the rookie season of goaltender Dan Blackburn, who made the NHL All-Rookie Team even as the Rangers fell back to last place in the conference. Despite these high-priced acquisitions, the Rangers still finished out of the playoffs. Later years saw other stars such as Alexei Kovalev, Jaromir Jagr, Martin Rucinsky and Bobby Holik added, but in 2002‚Äì03 and 2003‚Äì04, the team again missed the playoffs. Blackburn started strongly in 2002‚Äì03, but burned out after 17 games. He then missed 2003‚Äì04 due to mononucleosis and a damaged nerve in his left shoulder. Blackburn could not rehabilitate the damaged nerve, and was forced to retire at age 22. =Post-lockout revival (2005‚Äì2014)= Towards the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, GM Glen Sather finally gave in to a rebuilding process by trading away Brian Leetch, Alexei Kovalev and eight others for numerous prospects and draft picks. With the retirements of Pavel Bure and Mark Messier, as well as Eric Lindros signing with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the post-lockout Rangers, under new head coach Tom Renney, moved away from high- priced veterans towards a group of talented young players, such as Petr Prucha, Dominic Moore and Blair Betts. However, the focus of the team remained on veteran superstar Jaromir Jagr. The Rangers were expected to struggle during the 2005‚Äì06 season for their eighth consecutive season out of the post- season. For example, Sports Illustrated declared them the worst team in the NHL in their season preview, but behind stellar performances by Swedish rookie goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, Martin Straka, Michael Nylander, Prucha and Jagr, the Rangers finished the season a record of 44‚Äì26‚Äì12, their best record since 1993‚Äì94. Jagr broke the Rangers' single-season points record with a first- period assist in a 5‚Äì1 win against the New York Islanders on March 29, 2006. The assist gave him 110 points on the season, breaking Jean Ratelle's record. Less than two weeks later, on April 8, Jagr scored his 53rd goal of the season against the Boston Bruins, breaking the club record previously held by Adam Graves. Two games prior, on April 4, the Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3‚Äì2 in a shootout to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since 1996‚Äì97. On April 18, the Rangers lost to the Ottawa Senators 5‚Äì1, and, due to wins by Division rivals New Jersey and Philadelphia, the Rangers fell back to third place in the Atlantic and sixth in the Eastern Conference to end the season. In the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, the Rangers drew a matchup with the Devils and were defeated in a four-game sweep. In the process, they were outscored 17‚Äì4, as New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur took two shutouts and a 1.00 GAA to Lundqvist's 4.25. In the first game of the series, Jagr suffered an undisclosed injury to his left shoulder, diminishing his usefulness as the series progressed. He missed Game 2 of the series and was back in the lineup for Game 3, though he was held to just one shot on goal. However, on his first shift of Game 4, Jagr re-injured his shoulder and was unable to return for the remainder of the game. Jagr fell two points short of winning his sixth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion in 2005‚Äì06 (the San Jose Sharks' Joe Thornton claimed the award, his first, with 125 points), but Jagr did win his third Pearson Award as the players' choice for the most outstanding player. With the Rangers doing so well in 2005‚Äì06, expectations were raised for the 2006‚Äì07 season, evidenced by Sports Illustrated then predicting the Rangers would finish first in their division. Realizing the team had trouble scoring goals in the 2005‚Äì06 campaign, the Rangers went out and signed Triple Gold Club winner, 12-time 30-goal scorer and long-time Detroit Red Wing Brendan Shanahan to a one-year contract. However, the organization remained committed to its rebuilding program despite the signing of the 37-year-old left winger. The Rangers faced the Atlanta Thrashers in the first round of the 2007 NHL playoffs. On October 5, 2006, opening night of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Jagr was named the first team captain since Mark Messier's retirement. Though the Rangers started a bit slow in the first half of the 2006‚Äì07 season, the second half was dominated by the stellar goaltending of Henrik Lundqvist. On February 5, 2007 the Rangers acquired agitating forward Sean Avery in a trade with the Los Angeles Kings. The acquisition of Sean Avery brought new life and intensity to the team. Despite losing several players to injury in March, the Rangers went 10‚Äì2‚Äì3 in March to move into playoff position, and on April 5, clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season with a 3‚Äì1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. The Rangers finished the season ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning and the New York Islanders, finishing in third place in the Atlantic Division and sixth place in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year. Facing the Atlanta Thrashers in the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers swept the series thanks to play from all around the ice. However, the Rangers lost the next round to the Buffalo Sabres by four games to two. Scott Gomez with the Rangers during the 2007‚Äì08 season. Gomez signed with the Rangers in 2007. At the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, the Rangers chose Alexei Cherepanov 17th overall. Cherepanov had been ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the number one European skater and was considered to be a top-five pick leading up to the draft, but fell due to teams being unsure whether he would ever come to the NHL from Russia. Despite the departure of Michael Nylander in free agency, the 2007 free agency season started with a bang for the Rangers, with the signing of two high-profile centerman, Scott Gomez from New Jersey on a seven-year, $51.5 million contract, as well as Chris Drury from Buffalo on a five-year, $32.25 million deal. The moves, along with retaining most other key players, had been met favorably, as the Rangers appeared to be strong Stanley Cup contenders, making the playoffs for the third consecutive season and the second round for the second season in a row. However, despite these streaks, the Rangers failed to meet expectations, losing their second round series four games to one to the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following off-season saw the departures of captain Jaromir Jagr to the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), and alternate captains Martin Straka and Brendan Shanahan, who returned to play in the Czech Republic and with the New Jersey Devils, respectively. Following these departures, Chris Drury was named captain on October 3, 2008. The Rangers were one of four NHL teams to open their 2008‚Äì09 season in Europe, being featured in the Victoria Cup final, defeating the European Champions Cup winner Metallurg Magnitogorsk in Bern, Switzerland. The Rangers followed by playing two NHL regular-season games against Tampa Bay in Prague on October 4 and 5, winning both games 2‚Äì1. The Rangers tied the 1983‚Äì84 Rangers for the best start in franchise history with a 5‚Äì0 record and set the franchise record for best start in a season through the first 13 games by going 10‚Äì2‚Äì1 for 21 points, with the 10 wins and 21 points each becoming franchise records. However, a successful start to the season was tempered with by the news of the sudden death of 2007 first-round pick Alexei Cherepanov, which occurred during a KHL game in Russia on October 13, 2008. A disappointing second half of the season followed. After the Rangers went 2-7-3 in their previous 12 games, on February 23, 2009 coach Tom Renney was fired, with 2004 Stanley Cup and Jack Adams Award winner John Tortorella named as his replacement. The Rangers made the 2009 playoffs, but lost their opening round series to the Washington Capitals four games to three after winning the first two games in Washington and having a 3‚Äì1 series lead after Game 4. On June 30, 2009, the Rangers traded Scott Gomez, Tom Pyatt and Michael Busto to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Chris Higgins, Ryan McDonagh, Pavel Valentenko and Doug Janik. With Gomez's contract and salary cap hit gone, the Rangers then signed superstar Marian Gaborik on July 1, the first day of free agency. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, the Rangers failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years. There was some criticism that the off-season acquisition of Gaborik, among other top-tier players, had not paid off. However, Gaborik scored 42 goals and 86 points in the season, an impressive return for the team. Despite of a strong 8‚Äì2 start to the season, the Rangers appeared to play inconsistently with numerous losing streaks. By March 2010, the Rangers were in danger of falling out of the 2010 playoff race entirely, but they registered a respectable 7‚Äì1‚Äì2 record to finish the season. The final two games of the season were a home-and-home against the Philadelphia Flyers. The first was April 9, 2010, in New York, and the Rangers skated away with the victory, keeping their post-season hopes alive. The final game of the season would become the deciding game to determine who would make the playoffs. The Flyers peppered Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist with 47 shots, but scored only once. The game went to a shootout, and the Flyers prevailed to move on to the playoffs despite the strong overall finish to the season by the Rangers. For the 2010‚Äì11 season, the Rangers waived defenseman Wade Redden and brought in several players to achieve more balanced scoring. They also wore a third jersey for the first time in several years. On November 12, the Rangers unveiled the new Heritage Jersey for the first time at the rink at Rockefeller Center in a special ceremony featuring Rangers alumni and current players discussing the history of the storied franchise. The club wore the jersey for the first time on November 17 when they played the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden. The jersey was to be worn every time the Rangers play an Original Six team, or on a Sunday afternoon game at home. The Rangers' fate of making or missing the playoffs would come down to the final day of the regular season for the second-straight year. The team defeated the New Jersey Devils on the final day of the season to finish with 93 points on the year. However, in order to qualify for the 2011 playoffs, they needed the Carolina Hurricanes to lose their final game of the season, as Carolina owned the tiebreaker as both teams finished with the same number of points. Carolina lost its final game to Tampa Bay, 6‚Äì2, putting the Rangers in the playoffs after missing-out the previous season. The Rangers then faced Washington in the first round. After blowing a 3‚Äì0 third period lead in Game 4, with Washington ahead in the best-of-seven series two games to one, the Rangers lost the series in five games. It was the second time in three years that the Capitals eliminated the Rangers from the playoffs. Ryan Callahan was named the captain of the New York Rangers in September 2011. On May 13, 2011, Derek Boogaard, a player whom the Rangers signed the previous off-season for four years, was found dead in his Minnesota apartment. On June 29, 2011, the Rangers bought out captain Chris Drury's contract, and July 2, Brad Richards, an unrestricted free agent who had played with the Dallas Stars during the prior season, signed a nine-year, $60 million contract with the Rangers. On September 12, 2011, Ryan Callahan was named the 26th captain in New York Rangers history. He became the fifth- youngest captain in team history. Brad Richards and Marc Staal were named alternate captains on the same day. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, the Rangers finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Going 51‚Äì24‚Äì7, the team finished with 109 points for the regular season. Their leading scorer for the regular season was Marian Gaborik, who finished the season with 41 goals and 76 points while playing all 82 games. However, the Rangers missed-out on the Presidents' Trophy on the final day of the season to the Vancouver Canucks after a 4‚Äì1 loss to Washington. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers faced the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. After falling behind 3‚Äì2 in the series, the Rangers bounced back to win Game 6 in Ottawa, as well as the deciding Game 7 at home, propelling them to the Conference Semi-finals. In the Semi-finals, the Rangers faced the Capitals. In Game 3, Gaborik received a pass from Brad Richards to seal a victory 14:41 into the third overtime, giving the Rangers a 2‚Äì1 lead in the series. Washington then came back to tie the series 2‚Äì2 in Game 4. The Rangers avoided going down 3‚Äì2 in the series when Richards tied Game 5 at 2‚Äì2 with just 6.6 seconds left in the third period. The goal was scored on a power-play as a result of a high-sticking double-minor committed by Washington's Joel Ward on Rangers' forward Carl Hagelin. Then, in overtime, Rangers defenseman Marc Staal scored on the second penalty of the double-minor just 1:35 into overtime, giving the Rangers a 3‚Äì2 series lead. The Rangers went on to win the series 4‚Äì3, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1997. In the Conference Finals, they faced the New Jersey Devils, a major divisional rival. After leading the series 2‚Äì1, the Rangers lost three games in a row, losing Game 6 in New Jersey with a goal by Devils forward Adam Henrique at 1:03 in overtime, giving the Devils a 4‚Äì2 series win and ending the Rangers' season. On July 23, 2012, the Rangers traded Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for All- Star Rick Nash, Steven Delisle and a 2013 conditional third-round pick. At the 2013 NHL trade deadline on April 3, the Rangers then traded Marian Gaborik, Steven Delisle and Blake Parlett to Columbus in exchange for Derick Brassard, Derek Dorsett, John Moore and a 2014 sixth-round draft pick. After the Rangers were eliminated from the second round of the playoffs by Boston, management fired head coach John Tortorella, and on June 21, 2013, GM Glen Sather formally introduced ex-Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault as Tortorella's replacement. Return to the Final (2013‚Äì2014) Martin St. Louis with the Rangers, several weeks after being acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning, March 2014. On March 5, 2014, the Rangers traded captain Ryan Callahan, a first-round draft pick in 2015, a conditional second-round pick in 2014 (which later became a first-round pick) and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2015 in exchange for Tampa Bay captain Martin St. Louis and a conditional second- round pick in 2015. The trade occurred in large part after the Rangers and Callahan were unable to reach a contract extension in the days leading up to the deadline. During the regular season, the Rangers won 25 road games, setting a then-franchise record. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, New York defeated Philadelphia in seven games, and in the next round, the Rangers rallied from a 3‚Äì1 series deficit for the first time in their history to defeat Pittsburgh in seven games. They then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games to become the Eastern Conference champions, moving on to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 20 years. In the Finals, they faced the Los Angeles Kings, the Western Conference champions and champions in 2012. The Rangers led the first two games by two goals and eventually fell in overtime, and were then shut-out at home 3‚Äì0 in Game 3. The Kings outshot the Rangers in Game 4, but the Rangers staved off elimination by winning the game 2‚Äì1 to force a Game 5 in Los Angeles. They had another lead in Game 5, but after the game was tied and subsequently sent to overtime, Kings defenseman Alec Martinez scored with 5:17 left in the second overtime period to win the game for Los Angeles, 3‚Äì2, as well as the Stanley Cup. On June 20, 2014, a week after their season ended, the Rangers bought-out the remaining six years of Brad Richards' contract in order to free up salary cap space. This move left Marc Staal and Dan Girardi as the team's remaining alternate captains. =2014‚Äìpresent= Cam Talbot with the Rangers during the 2014‚Äì15 NHL season. The Rangers signed Talbot to a contract extension during that season. On October 6, 2014, defenseman Ryan McDonagh was named the Rangers' 27th captain in team history, with Derek Stepan, Dan Girardi, Marc Staal and Martin St. Louis serving as alternates. In the 2014‚Äì15 season, the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy for the third time in franchise history and their seventh division title by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 53‚Äì22‚Äì7. The 53 wins and 113 points both set franchise records. The division title was the Rangers' first in the Metropolitan Division, which was created during the NHL's realignment in the 2013 off-season. The team won 28 road games in the regular season, breaking the franchise record set the previous season. Over the course of the season, the Rangers agreed to terms on a contract extension with goaltender Cam Talbot, Marc Staal and Mats Zuccarello. In the playoffs, the Rangers dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round. The Rangers then came back from a 3‚Äì1 series deficit to win their second-round series against the Capitals in seven games, becoming the first team in NHL history to battle back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit in back-to-back seasons and sending the Rangers to the Eastern Conference Final for the third time in four years. However, after winning the first game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Rangers lost Game 2 by four goals. The two teams split the first four games of the series, but the Rangers lost Game 5 2‚Äì0 at home, which gave the Lightning an opportunity to clinch the Conference Finals in Tampa Bay. However, this did not happen in Game 6, as Derick Brassard scored a hat- trick and assisted on two other goals in an emphatic 7‚Äì3 Rangers victory to force a Game 7 in New York. There, the Lightning shutout the Rangers 2‚Äì0, ending the Rangers' season and marking the first occasion the Rangers had ever lost a Game 7 at home in franchise history and the first time they lost an elimination game at home since they lost to Buffalo in 2007. On June 27, 2015 the Rangers traded Carl Hagelin and a pair of draft picks to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Emerson Etem and a draft pick, Cam Talbot and a draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers for three draft picks, and prospect Ryan Haggerty to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Antti Raanta, who was to become the backup goaltender to Lundqvist. Subsequently, on July 1, 2015, Glen Sather resigned as GM, with Jeff Gorton taking his place to become the 11th general manager in team history. On July 2, 2015, Martin St. Louis announced his retirement from professional hockey. The team then signed Emerson Etem and re-signed Oscar Lindberg, Jesper Fast, J. T. Miller and Derek Stepan. The Rangers started off the 2015‚Äì16 season well. After 18 games, they had a 14‚Äì2‚Äì2 record and a nine- game winning streak, which was eventually halted by Tampa Bay. However, the organization soon went downhill in the winter, losing three-straight games against the Montreal Canadiens, Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers. They eventually posted a 4‚Äì7‚Äì2 record in December for only ten points. In January, the Rangers started playing more efficiently, posting a fair 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 record, and improved in February by going on a 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 run without any back-to-back losses. On January 8, 2016, the Rangers traded Emerson Etem to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Nicklas Jensen and a sixth-round pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. On February 28, the Rangers traded prospect Aleksi Saarela, a 2016 second-round draft pick and a 2017 second-round draft pick for Carolina Hurricanes' captain Eric Staal, who later left the team after the season. The Rangers finished the season third in the division with 101 points for back-to- back 100+ point seasons. Despite high hopes, the Rangers were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the 2016 playoffs in five games. On May 2, the Rangers agreed to terms with Antti Raanta on a contract extension, and on May 13, signed Pavel Buchnevich to an entry-level contract. On June 25, 2016, the Rangers acquired Nick Holden from the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for a 2017 fourth-round draft pick. Over the course of the summer, the Rangers re-signed J. T. Miller, Chris Kreider and Kevin Hayes, while Dominic Moore, among others, departed via free agency. On July 18, the Rangers traded their leading scorer Derick Brassard and a 2018 seventh-round draft pick to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Mika Zibanejad and a 2018 second- round draft pick. The team also signed Michael Grabner to a two-year contract and the much-anticipated college sensation Jimmy Vesey to a two-year, entry- level contract.  Traditions  The fans of the New York Rangers have several traditions that are part of the experience of watching a home game at Madison Square Garden. =Fandom=  The blue seats  In Rangers fan lore, one of the most traditional, as well as one of the rowdiest, sections of the Garden is the blue seats, in what was the 400 level, before the most recent renovation. The nickname came from the original color of those seats before the first Garden renovation in the early 1990s. In the 1970s, \\"blue-seaters\\" would heckle opposing players, and also heckle the \\"red-seaters\\", down below. This led to the perception that the blue seats were also home to a great deal of profanity, or \\"blue language.\\" The seats in the 400-level at MSG were redone in teal during the 1990 renovation of the Garden, but fans continued to refer to them as \\"the blues\\". Following the three-year transformation at the Garden that began in 2011, the blue seats now occupy only one end zone of the west side of the arena where the Rangers shoot twice. Because of the new balcony added above, these seats are considered \\"limited view\\"; they remain the cheapest seats in the building.  Dancing Larry  Dancing Larry, whose real name was Larry Goodman, has been a Rangers season ticket holder since 1988, and his famous dance routine began in the mid-to-late 1990s, when he danced in the aisle between sections 406 and 407. After the most recent MSG renovation, he now dances in the portal between sections 223 and 224. The dance usually occurs during the last TV timeout of the third period to get the crowd and the team pumped up. Larry dances to the song Strike It Up by Black Box which is cued up on the Madison Square Garden loud speakers by the technical staff.  The Chief  The Chief, whose real name was Robert Comas, was a fan of the Rangers who donned an Indian headdress complete with Ranger facepaint from 1971 to 1995. He became an unofficial mascot, \\"wandering around Madison Square Garden shaking hands, whooping and doing a war dance.\\" Comas retired from his role as The Chief in 1995, one year after the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. In 1998, Comas ran for public office as the Republican Party candidate for the State Senate in the 21st District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Mill Basin and other parts of southern Brooklyn. When he was unable to gather enough signatures to make the ballot, the Republican party had no candidate in the contest. Comas did run on the Conservative line. He managed to gather 3,255 votes, or 7.64% of the total votes counted, losing to incumbent Carl Kruger, who was convicted on federal bribery charges in 2011. Shortly after his bid for the New York State Senate failed, the Chief moved to Florida, where he resided until his death on September 17, 2009. He was 62. =Music=  Goal song  When the Rangers score a goal at Madison Square Garden the \\"Slapshot\\" (aka \\"The New York Rangers Goal Song\\") song is played following three blasts of a NYC Fire Engine horn. The song made its debut on January 20, 1995, the night the 1994 Stanley Cup Champion Banner was raised to the rafters. It was written by Ray Castoldi, the Music Director at Madison Square Garden.  National anthem singers  John Amirante was the long-time national anthem singer at Madison Square Garden. He first performed the national anthem at the Garden ice in October 1980, and has also sung for the Knicks and Yankees. In 2009, when Amirante was 74, he was singing the anthem at about half of the Rangers' home games. On April 18, 2015, after a 35-year run, Amirante sang what was thought to be his last National Anthem before Game 2 in Round 1 of the 2015 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins.https://nymag.com/daily/sports/2009/10/john_amirante_on_performing_th.html The following day, after a negative reaction from fans regarding the decision to forcibly retire Amirante, the Garden announced Amirante would be invited to be a guest anthem singer from time-to-time. On April 17 2018, Amirante passed away at the age of 83.  Victory song  After every home victory the \\"New York Rangers Victory Song\\" is played. It was written in 1940 by J. Fred Coots (an avid Rangers fan and New Yorker) to pay tribute to the then-Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers. The music for the song can be heard here. = Salute the crowd = Rangers saluting the crowd at Madison Square Garden. After every Rangers home win, the team gathers at center ice and raise their sticks in the air to salute the Rangers supporters. The salute (the idea of defenseman Darius Kasparaitis) began in the early part of the 2005‚Äì06 season, and has proved extremely popular with both the players and fans alike. The salute to the fans is typically done only after home victories. However, after the Rangers fell to the rival New Jersey Devils in a four-game sweep in the first round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, the fans' cheers at the conclusion of an otherwise outstanding breakout season caused the players to stay on the ice after the loss and give the fans one final salute for the year. The Rangers have saluted the crowd on several occasions since after being eliminated from the playoffs at home.

It is a long sword with a narrow to wide blade and sheathe. The sword is sharp, and cuts on contact but typically begins to dull if not sharpened regularly. It can be single-edged or double-edged. These blades are typically heavier by the tip of the blade. During wars, pepper and poison are added to it to paralyze anyone who is cut by the sword. It can be wielded in any way (either one- handed or two-handed). The Yoruba people use this sword for hunting, war and other uses. The blade of the sword is in an elongated leaf-shaped form. It is designed for cutting and hacking. Production The Yoruba blacksmiths were among the most skilled in West Africa. They employed different techniques in the making of these Ida swords.

He started his career at Barnsley, and spent time playing for Darlington and Hartlepool United in the Football League, and played at non-league level with Gateshead, Shaw Lane and Gainsborough Trinity. He also earned a combined 26 Youth International Caps with England at U15 to U20 levels.https://uk.linkedin.com/in/neil- austin-253955103 Biography =Barnsley= Born in Barnsley, Austin came through the youth ranks with his local club Barnsley F.C., playing 165 first team games, including 25 games in the 2006‚Äì07 Championship season.

His season ended early though as he collected an injury that had plagued him the previous season. In June 2008, Austin underwent an operation on his troublesome ankle which was successful. He scored his 1st goal of the season in Darlington's 6‚Äì0 away win at Macclesfield Town, it been a nice 25 yard drive.

Early life Born at 3 Park PlaceEdinburgh asnd Leith Post Office Directory 1849-50 in Edinburgh on 5 April 1849, Forbes was the second son of James David Forbes and Alicia Wauchope. His father was later Principal of St Andrews University. Forbes was educated at Edinburgh Academy, the University of St Andrews, Christ's College and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. Career In 1873 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at Anderson's University, Glasgow, (the nucleus of the University of Strathclyde). In his lectures he advocated using electricity to power transportation. His main work at this time, however, was research into the velocity of light. Arguably his most important work was as a supervising engineer for several pioneering hydroelectric schemes. From 1891 to 1895, Forbes was consulting engineer on the Niagara Falls hydroelectric scheme. He also advised on other schemes, in India (1893), South Africa (1895), New Zealand (1896) and Egypt (1898). In 1880 Forbes resigned from Anderson's University and moved to London. For the next two decades he devoted himself to electrical power engineering. Commissioned to report on how the City and South London Railway should be powered, he recommended electricity. Soon the entire London Underground would follow his advice. In 1881 he served as a juror at the Paris Exposition Internationale d'Electricite. He was subsequently admitted to the French Legion of Honour. In 1906 he built a home near Pitlochry to house his library. Forbes' family had frequently holidayed in Pitlochry and his father had befriended the Butters ‚Äì the area's main landowners ‚Äì who initially leased and eventually sold Forbes the land on which his house stood. This house, which he called The Shed was a large wooden structure with an observatory on the upper storey. It overlooks the valley that in the 1950s would be flooded to create Loch Faskally and the hydroelectric scheme Forbes had proposed in the early 1900s. In Pitlochry he returned to an earlier interest, from 1906 to 1930 delivering the David Elder lectures on Astronomy at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow. Astronomical expeditions and explorations For the 1874 Transit of Venus, Forbes was lead astronomer at the Hawai'i sub-station, part of the larger expedition to the Sandwich Islands led by Captain George Lyon Tupman. He returned to Scotland via Peking and St Petersburg, crossing the Gobi desert and Siberia in 1875. Nearly 25 years later Forbes wrote up his overland odyssey ‚Äì it was a journey that few seasoned western explorers had made, much less lone travellers in their mid-20s. With contacts made on this journey, Forbes was able to become the only British war correspondent with the Russian army in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, reporting for The Times. He received the Russian Order of St George for this work. He wrote and lectured widely about astronomy for professional and popular audiences. He predicted the existence of a trans-Neptunian planet fifty years before the discovery of Pluto. In 1880, George Forbes was the first to postulate the existence of trans-Neptunian planets that were somewhat similar to the hypothetical Planet Nine in the far outer Solar System. In his model the planet had a semi-major axis of ‚àº300 AU, and he based locations from clustering of the aphelion distances of periodic comets. Inventions In 1882, Forbes became manager of the British Electric Light Company, manufacturers of carbon filaments and arc lamps. He experimented with using carbon for the brushes in electric motors, rather than wire or gauze and in 1885 took out a patent for the Improved Means for Establishing Electric Connection between Surfaces in Relative Motion Applicable to the Collectors of Dynamo Machines. This advocated carbon as a current collector for rotating electrical machines. The invention would prove outstandingly successful and it is in universal use in electricity generation to this day. He could have become a rich man with such an innovation but he sold his American patent rights to Westinghouse Electric for ¬£2,000. There is no evidence that he received any UK royalties. In the obituary published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society, G. L. Addenbroke wrote that 'Forbes always referred to this work with much modesty, but there can be no doubt that, he presented to the World an idea of great engineering and commercial value, the importance of which he does not seem to have fully grasped at the time.' For another take on Forbes' \\"modesty\\" see Blackwoods Magazine, Vol. CLVIII, Pg. 430. After the turn of the century, Forbes turned to military work, studying techniques of gunnery. Between 1903 and 1906 working with the Admiralty he developed a rangefinder that was still in use by the Navy at the outset of the Second World War. During the First World War he was involved in devising methods of signalling for submarines. Honours and awards Forbes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1887. He was also Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, MInstCE and Member of the Vienna Astronomiches Verein. Forbes was elected a Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and received an honorary LLD from St Andrews. The University of Strathclyde honoured his memory in 1987 by naming a new student hall of residence after him. Later life Forbes did not marry and, in his last years, became something of a recluse, disillusioned that his obvious talents had earned him neither fame nor fortune. He lived in increasing poverty, though in 1928 friends did successfully petition a variety of organisations for assistance on his behalf. Until close to the end of his life, Pitlochry was his home. Eventually, however, friends insisted that he move south where he could be more easily cared for. He died in an accident at his home in Worthing on 22 October 1936. George Forbes was described in his obituaries as a man with a 'stern code of honour' who 'thought much of his work and little of his reward'. A friend, the engineer Samuel Mavor, was more effusive: for him, Forbes ‚Äòwas the best type of Scottish gentleman, of tall and handsome appearance... he had a singularly attractive personality, fine character, a brilliant intellect and the manners of a courtier.‚Äô Publications Forbes published throughout his life. Titles include The Transit of Venus (1874), Lectures on Electricity (1888) and Alternating and Interrupted Electric Currents (1895). Once he settled in Pitlochry, his output became prolific: History of Astronomy (1909) Star Talks to Boy Scouts (1911), David Gill, Man and Astronomer (1916) and The Wonder and the Glory of the Stars (1926), and numerous contributions to learned journals were all produced during this time.

Both clubs realised that the best opportunity for √Ñngelholm to have a professional club would be to merge the two clubs. They merged in 1976 and founded √Ñngelholms FF. However the success that the two clubs had in vision took until the 1990s to aspire. Between 1997 and 2001, √Ñngelholms FF were promoted from Division 4 to the second highest tier, Superettan.

It attracted many prominent intellectuals and writers and acted as an unofficial student wing of the Socialist Party of America. The Society sponsored lecture tours, magazines, seminars and discussion circles all over the US to propagate socialist ideas among America's college population. The group expanded into a philosophy in the 1920s that did not focus exclusively or even primarily on college students. To symbolize the shift in emphasis, the group changed its name to the League for Industrial Democracy in 1921. History =Establishment= The Intercollegiate Socialist Society was the brainchild of left-wing novelist Upton Sinclair. Supporters of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) were heartened by the results of the Presidential election of 1904, which saw the party's candidate, Eugene V. Debs, win approximately 400,000 votes.Harry W. Laidler, \\"Ten Years of ISS Progress,\\" The Intercollegiate Socialist, vol. 4, no. 1 (Oct.-Nov. 1915), pg. 16. One supporter in particular, novelist Upton Sinclair, was motivated to help advance the socialist idea among the political leaders of tomorrow by establishing a new organization targeted at college students. Sinclair made contact with a number of leading public intellectuals of the day, gaining formal endorsements for a new national college socialist organization from a number of important figures, including novelist Jack London, millionaire financier James Graham Phelps Stokes, socialist republican William English Walling, magazine publisher B. O. Flower, attorney Clarence Darrow, writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman, publicist Leonard D. Abbott, abolitionist hero Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and Harry W. Laidler. Over the signatures of these and other prominent public figures, in the Spring of 1905 Sinclair issued a call for the formation of a new organization, a group to be called the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. Their original call was written as follows:Rand School of Social Science, The American Labor Year Book, Volume 1, 1916 The new organization gathered for the first time shortly after the start of the new academic year, meeting on September 12, 1905 in a room at a restaurant in lower Manhattan.Laidler, \\"Ten Years of ISS Progress,\\" pg. 17. About one hundred supporters of the new organization attended this meeting, chaired by Sinclair, including a number of prominent socialist intellectuals. The gathering elected Jack London as the first president of the organization, Sinclair as first vice-president, and millionaire philanthropist J. Graham Phelps Stokes as second vice-president, with anti-child labor activist Owen R. Lovejoy chosen as treasurer. The Intercollegiate Socialist Society set goals for its organization. It sought to promote and intelligent interest in Socialism among college men and women,Paul W. Shafer and John Howland Snow, The Turning of the Tides. Long House Publishing, 1962; pg. 1., familiarize students with the inherent evils of [the] American economic and social system based on laissez-faire policies,George Dykhuizen, The Life and Mind of John Dewey. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1973; pg. ???. and promote the establishment of a socialist order.The Life and Mind of John Dewey. Dykhuizen, George (1973). Carbondale: Southern Illinois The Intercollegiate Socialist Society was sought to achieve these goals by organizing chapters on college campuses, introduce socialist supporters into society, and bring socialist party members into labor unions, schools, and government.Jill S. Sprik, \\"Stealing Capitalism: The Crime of the Century,\\" American Thinker, March 28, 2010. =Structure= Rules were laid down as to how to structure the collegiate chapters of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, organizing students on each campus into individual chapters who would fund the central organization through a small percentage of their membership dues collected to the national Society. Chapters would appoint officers, consisting of a President, two Vice Presidents, a Secretary, and a Treasurer, who would be elected annually by the vote of the entire society. The Society's activities would be overseen by these appointed individuals along with six additional members who would form an Executive Committee. =Development= The Intercollegiate Socialist Society organized slowly at first, as chapters were banned in most colleges and universities by conservative administrators who had the power to prohibit establishment of student organizations. Chapters slowly came to existence, frequently with names that did not signify its connection to the Intercollegiate Socialist Society at all, an example being the Wesleyan Social Study Club of Wesleyan University, which was one of the first collegiate organizations associated with the Intercollegiate Socialist Society as well as a chapter established at Columbia University. Following these clubs, other affiliated socialist clubs were formed at Harvard University, Princeton, Barnard College, New York University Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania. The college socialist clubs discussed current issues as well as distributed socialist propaganda and arranged lectures on their campuses to try to get more support the socialist cause.Tim Davenport, \\"Intercollegiate Socialist Society (1905-1921),\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ =Transformation= In 1921, the Society recognized that socialism had become extremely unpopular in the United States after the violent Russian revolution. While its objectives to promote socialism in the United States didn't change, the name was changed to the League for Industrial Democracy. In 1960 the League gave birth to Students for a Democratic Society, the principal representation in the United States of the New Left.

Design and development Designed by Ren√© Leduc in 1938, it was built at the Breguet Aviation factory after a protracted, semi-secret construction phase kept at arm's length from German occupation authorities, and was finally completed in 1947. The aircraft featured a double-walled fuselage, with the pilot controlling the aircraft from within the inner shell. The circular gap between this and the outer, cylindrical shell provided the inlet for the ramjet. Testing First flight of the SE Languedoc n6 with Leduc 010, 1946. It could not take off unassisted (ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed and thus cannot move an aircraft from a standstill) and was therefore intended to be carried aloft by a parasite aircraft mother ship, such as the four-engined AAS 01A & -B German-origin designs or the French-designed Sud-Est Languedoc four-engined airliners, and released at altitude. Following test flights of the AAS 01/Leduc 0.10 composite, independent unpowered gliding tests began in October 1947. After three such flights, the first powered flight from atop an AAS 01 mother ship was made on 21 April 1949 over Toulouse.

The engines were replaced by inert mass balances. This aircraft flew 83 test flights, and is preserved at Le Bourget.

Band members included Aaron Buchanan (vocals), Sid Glover (guitar, vocals), Rob Ellershaw (bass, backing vocals), and Chris Rivers (drums). The band split up in January 2017. Their debut album, Filthy Empire, was released on 4 February 2013 in the UK and 5 February 2013 in the US. They released their first single, \\"Fire, Fire\\", in September 2012 leading up to their album release. The single peaked at No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock chart. History =Heaven's Basement EP (2008‚Äì2010)= Heaven's Basement was a hard rock band from the UK that was renowned for heavy touring schedules and extremely energetic live performances. The band first performed live in Kettering at The Sawyers venue in April 2008 after a few months of being locked away in a studio writing songs. Since that point, Heaven's Basement toured Europe with the likes of Papa Roach, Buckcherry, Bon Jovi, Theory of a Deadman, Shinedown, Blind Melon, Hardcore Superstar, Tesla, Madina Lake, D-A-D, Thunder, Black Stone Cherry, Halestorm, D'espairsRay and Black Veil Brides as well as playing at many festivals such as Bloodstock Open Air, Hard Rock Hell, Graspop Metal Meeting, Download Festival, and Sonisphere among others. Heaven's Basement also worked with the American record producer Bob Marlette in the studio. They were invited to open for Bon Jovi on the Manchester show of their tour at the City of Manchester Stadium, playing to an audience of around 50,000 people. Later that summer, the band released their own self-titled E.P. which was recorded at Sandhills studio in Liverpool. The rest of the summer was spent with the band playing small clubs and pubs all across the UK, building their fanbase. In November 2008 Heaven's Basement were invited to be the main support for Thunder on their UK tour, which also helped to rapidly build their fanbase. They ended 2008 with a UK headline tour, with support from fellow upcoming band Wired Desire. After impressing Thunder on their UK tour, Heaven's Basement started 2009 with the main support slot to Thunder on their European tour in Feb/March which included dates in Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Switzerland. In early September 2009, Heaven's Basement announced on their MySpace page that their bassist, Rob Randell, had left the band for personal reasons. As the band had many gigs lined up for the month after this, Jonny Rocker took on bass duties for some of the shows. The band held auditions for a new bass player, and it was announced late in October that Rob Ellershaw was to take over. Rob had supported Heaven's Basement in his previous band Whitefire for a number of shows in 2008. In October 2009, Heaven's Basement appeared live alongside Papa Roach and Madina Lake during Papa Roach's Metamorphosis tour of the United Kingdom. According to both Metal Hammer and Kerrang! magazines, as one of the best live bands in Britain. They returned to the UK for a full headlining tour in December 2009, with Dear Superstar and New Device supporting. They also appeared as co-headliners with the Eureka Machines at Rockit '09, Rugby, alongside local act Audio Narcotix. During 2009, Bob Marlette expressed his interest in working with the band to produce some songs. He traveled to the UK for two sessions with Heaven's Basement at Monow Valley studios. Two of the songs recorded were added to the band's EP (\\"Can't Let Go\\" and \\"Misunderstood\\" replacing \\"Saint Routine\\" and \\"Fear of Getting Off\\"). Another song from the sessions, \\"The Long Goodbye\\" was released in early 2010 via the band's MySpace site, but others remained unreleased. In February 2010, just two weeks before the UK headline tour, the band announced that lead singer Richie Hevanz was leaving the band, citing the reason that the demands of constant touring had overwhelmed him. Just as Hevanz left the band, they were also confirmed as main support to Theory of a Deadman across Europe throughout March and April. Heaven's Basement called upon friend Johnny Fallen from UK based band \\"The Fallen\\" to sing temporarily whilst they searched for a new frontman. Heaven's Basement appeared at a number of high-profile festivals during the summer of 2010, including Sonisphere at Knebworth park on the Bohemia stage (headlined by Rammstein) and the Swedish Sonisphere pre-party with The Cult. They also appeared at the first Getaway Festival in Sweden alongside Deftones and Airbourne. Guitarist Jonny Rocker broke his finger whilst playing football in July 2010 a few hours before the band were due to go stage opening for Papa Roach. The band decided to carry on and play the show as a four-piece, and the rest of the summer headline and festival dates were also performed as a four-piece. Heaven's Basement released a statement in August 2010 informing everyone that they would be spending the rest of 2010 mainly off the road, working on brand new material whilst seeking a new full-time singer. =Unbreakable EP (2011)= On Thursday 17 February 2011, Heaven's Basement released a statement saying that Aaron Buchanan (ex-Oceans Upon Us) would be taking over on lead vocals, and that rhythm guitarist and long-time band member Jonny Rocker would be leaving to pursue a more behind-the-scenes career in music. Heaven's Basement stated that they would, for the foreseeable future, be a four-piece. On the same day, a new song 'Unbreakable' was released which was also revealed to be the title of the band's second EP. The Unbreakable EP was released on 5 May at the band's first show of their UK headline tour, and was later released on iTunes. In May through to June, the band toured extensively across the UK. Following a highly successful UK tour, Heaven's Basement were offered an acoustic slot at Download Festival and Sonisphere Festival, as well as a main-stage slot at High Voltage Festival in London, alongside the likes of Judas Priest, Dream Theater and Slash. They prepared for these acoustic dates with a warm-up show in The World's End, Camden. Heaven's Basement released a statement in association with these shows, saying that they weren't going to become just a 'soft' acoustic band (as many bands at the time were choosing to perform acoustic sets), and that fans could expect an equally energetic performance from their acoustic shows as they could from their full electric gigs. In October 2011, Heaven's Basement travelled to Los Angeles for a month to record new material. In November, they announced that they'd signed a deal with Red Bull Records. \\"Paper Plague\\", a new song recorded during this recording session, was released as a free download, and three new shows were announced for December 2011. =Filthy Empire, Buchanan's departure and split (2012‚Äì2017)= In September 2012, the band released a single from their debut album Filthy Empire entitled \\"Fire, Fire\\". John Feldmann produced, co-wrote on, and mixed the album. The band promoted this with a month-long European tour with Halestorm and the band's first ever appearance in America playing alongside The Darkness at Club Nokia in Los Angeles on 24 October 2012. They then went on to do a UK and European tour with Seether in November 2012 and finished off 2012 with a show at the Camden Barfly, London on 18 December 2012. The band returned to perform at Carolina Rebellion and Rock on The Range through the spring and summer of 2013. They had some show dates with Buckcherry, before returning to the UK for their headline run in July. The band then went on tour in the US and Canada with The Pretty Reckless and Louna. They closed out the year in the UK and Europe with Black Veil Brides. They were subsequently scheduled to perform throughout Australia as part of the 2014 Soundwave Festival. During 2015, the band began recording their new album, stating that the new record would be released sometime later in the year. Filthy Empire, the band's debut album, was released on 4 February 2013 to excellent reviews, including KKKK from Kerrang, and entered the BBC Rock Album Chart at No. 9 in the UK.Kerrang!, 6 February 2013 This album included the singles \\"Fire, Fire\\", \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" and \\"I Am Electric\\", each of which was accompanied by a music video. \\"Fire, Fire\\" peaked at No. 11 on the US Mainstream Rock chart (Week of 10/05/2013). On 21 October 2015, it was announced via social media that Aaron Buchanan had parted ways with the band, with the following statement: \\"We've all had a fantastic few years touring the world with Filthy Empire but we simply feel that our time together has run its course.\\" Buchanan went on to form Aaron Buchanan & The Cult Classics in April 2016, with debut album \\"The Man With Stars On His Knees\\" (mastered at Abbey Road Studios) released on 26 May 2017 to critical acclaim. In 2016, former band member Richie Hevanz became frontman of Fragile Things, following a short stint in a band called Endless Mile. In January 2017, Heaven's Basement announced via social media that they had decided to split up. Former band members Sid Glover and Rob Ellershaw went on to found a new band called The Cruel Knives, together with Tom Harris and Al Junior.

It was first broadcast on 22 October 1991. This episode sees the first appearance of Eddie's \\"real friends\\" Spudgun (Steven O'Donnell) and Dave Hedgehog (Christopher Ryan). Synopsis Richie breaks his leg, but he is determined not to let it spoil his birthday celebrations. Plot The episode begins with Eddie sitting down at the breakfast table. Richie then enters the room in his pyjamas singing \\"Happy Birthday to Me\\", much to Eddie's dismay. Richie then begins his annual birthday \\"routine\\" of reading what are obviously forged cards, including some supposedly from Sue Carpenter, General Pinochet, Rod Steiger, and \\"all the lads on the Ark Royal\\". Eddie claims that the cards are the same ones Richie received last year. One of the cards is from ABBA with \\"Happy Christmas 1973\\" written inside. Another is clearly forged but appears to be from the people of the Soviet Union \\"in grateful thanks to comrade Richie\\". Eddie points out that Richie has simply written it himself and put all the R's the wrong way round, Trying to save face, Richie insists that this is how Russian is written. Richie asks Eddie where his birthday gift is and, after annoying Richie with a couple of gag gifts (Richie's comb that he \\"lost\\" last week and the TV remote), Eddie hands Richie a piece of paper with the words \\"Madame Swish 3:30\\" written on it. Richie, believing it to be a prostitute's card, heaps praise on Eddie and becomes excited at the prospect of finally having sex. However, it soon comes to light that Madame Swish is actually a horse running in the 3:30 race at Kempton. An ungrateful Richie struggles to hide his disappointment and when a clearly frustrated Eddie points out that he has given Richie a \\"red hot tip\\", Richie retorts that there is \\"nothing he can do about it now\\". Eventually, Richie relents and gives Eddie ¬£20 to put on the horse, with odds of 10/1. Whilst Richie puts up his birthday decorations, Eddie returns after the big race and successfully fools Richie into thinking that the ¬£20 bet Richie put on the race has left him with ¬£2 in winnings. As Eddie tosses over the winnings, Richie falls off the ladder he is standing on and breaks his leg. Richie then begs Eddie to \\"get the ambulance\\" only to be informed that they \\"haven't got an ambulance\\". As a result, Eddie gives assistance, which results in Richie being knocked unconscious before he eventually manages to get to hospital. Eddie and Richie return from the hospital, with Richie bandaged up and in a wheelchair at 7 p.m., when Richie is expecting his party guests. As the clock strikes 7 there is a knock at the door - however only Eddie's both \\"real\\" friends, Dave Hedgehog and Spudgun, are there. Richie realises he has no friends and invites the pair to stay, following which he insists the group play \\"Sardines\\" - a variant of hide-and-seek in which one person hides and the rest have to find him, and when they find him they hide with him. However, being in a wheelchair, Richie needs the other three to hide him in the upstairs cupboard, and they must do so with their eyes closed. Once they have hidden Richie and counted to ten, Eddie, Spudgun, and Dave instead decide to spend the night in front of the television, drinking the liquor Eddie has bought with the winnings he conned Richie out of. Richie is ecstatic after being in the upstairs cupboard for over five hours, believing it to be a world record, but soon after he gets bored and decides to rejoin them downstairs. Due to his immobility, Richie falls down the stairs, crashing through the bathroom door breaking his other leg, much to the amusement of the other three. A drunken Spudgun then vomits on and accidentally falls on top of the injured Richie. Richie's second mishap just so happens to occur at the same time as last orders at the local pub, so Eddie invites the regulars around for a quick party. Eddie amuses the crowd by doing impersonations of Richie - with a mop end on his head and saying \\"Oh! Oh! why won't anyone ever have it off with me? Maybe it's because I'm a big fat ugly bastard with a microscopic penis!\\" Richie (now with both legs in casts) then enters the room, although he is oblivious to Eddie's mockery of him. After Eddie convinces him that all of his friends have turned up for his party after all, Richie cheers up and attempts to boss over the activities. After attempting to divest a female guest of her blouse, he is stopped by her boyfriend, who then proceeds to get everyone together to give Richie the bumps. As they all throw him into the air, Richie hits the ceiling and his casts shatter, ending the episode with a close-up of him screaming in pain. Continuity and production errors *Eddie tries to put Richie's leg back in place by tying the leg to the door with string, and slams the door. As he does this, the string pulls Richie and he hits the door. If watching in slow motion, once the door is slammed, Richie's jeans rip, revealing the fake leg, and Mayall's real leg behind it. Continuing in slow motion, a trolley can be seen under Richie as he is pulled across the floor. * Eddie, Hedgehog and Spudgun help Richie get up the stairs in his wheelchair to play Sardines. When Spudgun leans on the wall, the whole stage shakes. * It is often stated, notably in the stage shows, that Eddie is unable to read or write. However, in this episode, he is seen to write 'I'm sorry, I'm a twat... ten times.', although the show seemed to have three different timelines; one for the series, one for the stage shows and one for ‚ÄúGuest House Paradiso‚Äù, where the characters have different surnames. * Eddie, Hedgehog and Spudgun end up watching Eddie's Emmerdale Farm compilation on video. However, Eddie does not install a VCR until \\"Carnival\\", the final episode of series three. It could however be implied, that the TV set in this episode was later destroyed in ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù, and then replaced by a TV set without one. As it was rented from Rumbelows (as mentioned in the same episode), a technician could have set it up for them. Trivia * Richie claims at one point that he 'doesn't have time to put on (his) girl-bait underpants.' This is a reference to The Young Ones episode Summer Holiday, where it is revealed that Rik Mayall's character Rick also owns a similar pair of pants.

It was founded by Farid and Sue Dahdah, in 1980. It is named after the former prime minister Abdul Hamid Sharaf who had recently died at the time. The school offers the American system and the British system. The main language of instruction is English while Arabic is supplemented for other subjects. The Abdul Hamid Sharaf School is a unique, non-traditional institution. It has many characteristics that make it different from most schools. Her Majesty Queen Noor and Her Excellency Mrs. Leila Sharaf have been very helpful and encouraging over the years. Her Majesty sponsored a Montessori training program in the school and provided the equipment and materials for a Montessori kindergarten class in 1982, the first in the kingdom. Her Excellency Mrs. Leila Sharaf presented the school with a sizable fund to establish its first library Dr. Sue Dahdah and husband, engineer Farid Dahdah, founded the school in 1980. It was among the first of many modern, private, non-parochial schools to open in Amman, Jordan in the early eighties. Starting with 18 students in a small rented villa, the school soon outgrew the location and moved to its current premises in the summer of 1991. The school currently has capacity for 800 students in kindergarten through twelfth grades. The school is located in the affluent neighbourhood of Deir Ghbar in West Amman, not far from the American Embassy, the British Embassy and The French School. The easiest ways to reach the school are to exit from the airport highway or to come from the sixth circle.

It is currently based in Plymouth University. The Collegium's Hub is the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts (CAiiA), and it has had nodes in Zurich, Milan, Lucerne, Trento, Kefalonia, and currently in Shanghai. The founding President is Professor Roy Ascott. Planetary Collegium logo  History  The Planetary Collegium was conceived and established by Roy Ascott as the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts (CAiiA) in 1994 at what is now the University of Wales, Newport Three years later, Ascott established STAR (Science Technology and Art Research) in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth. CAiiA-STAR constituted a joint research platform, with access to supervisory and technical resources of both universities. In 2003, Ascott contracted to relocate the platform to Plymouth University, renaming it the Planetary Collegium, where it is currently located in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. The contract with Plymouth University expires in July 2021, when Ascott plans to relocate it in China. Since 1997, the Collegium has given more than seventy conferences and symposia in Europe, North and South America, Japan, China and Australia. Since its inception, first at the University of Wales, and currently at Plymouth, over 80 doctoral candidates have graduated from the programme. Aims The Collegium aims to produce new knowledge in the context of the arts, through transdisciplinary inquiry and critical discourse, with special reference to technoetic research and to advances in science and technology. Its seeks to reflect the social, technological and spiritual aspirations of an emerging planetary society, while sustaining a critical awareness of the retrograde forces and fields that inhibit social and cultural development. It combines the face-to-face association of individuals with the trans-cultural unity of telematic communities, thereby developing a network of research nodes strategically located across the planet, each with a distinctive cultural ethos. The Collegium seeks outcomes that involve new language, systems, structures, and behaviours, and insights into the nature of mind, matter and human identity.  Structure  As conceived and directed by Ascott, the Planetary Collegium consists of artists, theoreticians and scholars working within the context of transdisciplinarity and syncretism so as to develop their research in the practice and theory of new media art with a special interest in telematics and technoetics. Currently, their doctoral research leads to the award of the University of Plymouth PhD. Post-doctoral research is also pursued. It has attracted an impressive number of internationally well-established artists, musicians, performers, designers, architects, theorists and scholars involved in doctoral and post-doctoral research. Currently, the hub of the Collegium, CAiiA-Hub (the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts) is situated in the School of Art and Media, Faculty of Arts, Plymouth University.Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 464 The Collegium has a Node De Tao-Node in Shanghai.

The event is held during a hurricane. However the guests are typically allowed to stay with the host for 3‚Äì5 days (weather permitting) and guests, in return, bring hurricane supplies such as radios, first aid supplies, food, etc. The infamous Hurricane Camille Hurricane Party did not occur, but 8 people from the apartments died and the entire building was destroyed. Background Hurricane parties were formed by people living in the southern hurricane areas of the United States, especially in Florida. Events are held by people who cannot or choose not to evacuate during a hurricane warning, or when no evacuation orders are issued. Hosts may also lack hurricane supplies, therefore they invite others to stay with them so as to share supplies and company. However, these events are usually more centered on the people and the socialness of the event, yet they are not necessarily done with diversion as an objective. Another rationale for hosting hurricane parties is the expectation that power service may be lost for days or even weeks. As a result most perishable items, particularly frozen meats, will surely be wasted after the storm. In order to make good use of these items, grilling is an important aspect of many hurricane parties, as a way of \\"cleaning out the freezer.\\" Party supplies and customs Hurricane parties are designed for many individuals to pool resources with the expectation that there will be no electricity and no open stores or restaurants for several days. Following hurricanes, there is generally a curfew set by local police to reduce looting and crime when resources are already stretched thin. The hurricane party means that people don't have to worry about traveling when roads and transportation will be impassable. The hurricane party frequently aims to go through perishable food, and thus grilling is a common activity since grills can be used regardless of the status of electric utilities. Alcohol is almost always in good supply at a hurricane party, but guests are advised to pace themselves since these parties are often multi-day events. Officials advise against drinking alcohol because people need to be alert during a disaster. Party advocates encourage drinking as an anesthetic measure. Hurricane parties started with the availability of reliable forecasts and mass communications which coincided with the repeal of prohibition.

The Workers' Council of the United States -- commonly known as the \\"Workers' Council\\" -- was a short-lived organized faction of former Socialist Party of America members seeking to affiliate with the Comintern. Failing that, they agitated for the creation of an open communist party. While a small and short-lived group, it nevertheless played an important role in the 1921 creation of the Workers Party of America, and included many individuals who would have prominent careers in radical and labor movements such as Moissaye Olgin, J. Louis Engdahl, Alexander Trachtenberg, William F. Kruse, and Melech Epstein.Epstein, Melech, Pages from a Colorful Life, New York; Bloch Publishing Company, 1971, pp.68-70. Organizational history The group began as the Committee for the Third International in 1920, as an internal group within the Socialist Party advocating affiliation with the Communist International. Meanwhile, several ethnic federations were growing weary of the rightward shift of the party. The Finnish Socialist Federation voted to leave in December 1920. When the party convention decided against joining the Comintern at its June 1921 convention, the Czech federation left in late August, followed by the Yiddish language-speaking Jewish Socialist Federation in September. The Jewish Federation would provide the bulk of the group's membership. The Committee officially left the Socialist Party after the Jewish Federation had seceded, changing its name to the \\"Workers Council of the United States.\\" The new group advocated a completely legal Communist movement in the United States, a stand that only aggravated internal disharmony within the recently united Communist Party of America.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957; pp. 330-334. After a series of negotiations the Workers' Council, the American Labor Alliance (the CPs already existing legal front) and the Communist Party of America agreed to the creation of the Workers Party of America at a convention at Star Casino, New York on December 23‚Äì26, 1921. One of the stipulations for the Workers' Council joining the new organization was the creation of a daily Yiddish newspaper. This was paper, the Morgen Freiheit (\\"Morning Freedom\\"), was launched on April 22, 1922, with M.J. Olgin as editor.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 340-341. From April 1 to December 15, 1921, the Workers' Council published ten issues of a biweekly serial called The Workers' Council. The publication was initially edited by Benjamin Glassberg, who was succeeded by Louis Engdahl. At the time of the establishment of the Workers Party of America, this periodical was merged with The Toiler to form The Worker, which in 1924 expanded to daily frequency as the well-known publication, The Daily Worker.Walter Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950.

A member of Painters Eleven, his paintings are associated with the Color Field movement and Post- painterly Abstraction. Inspired by Henri Matisse and American abstract expressionist painters like Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis, Bush encapsulated joyful yet emotional feelings in his vibrant paintings. Life and early work Bush was born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1909. As a young man, he attended the Royal Canadian Academy school in Montreal, Quebec, where he studied with Adam Sheriff Scott and Edmond Dyonnet in the basic principles of art. In his early stages, Bush was influenced by the work of Charles Comfort and the Group of Seven. He began his professional career as a landscape artist and focused on painting landscapes, influenced by the Group of Seven. He also attended Charles Comfort's weekly life model drawing sessions, hosted in Comfort's studio in Toronto. During the 1940s, he ran a commercial art business and, by night, furthered his studies at the Ontario College of Art. Bush, like other Canadian artists of the time, was sheltered from major European influences. After seeing the work of the American Abstract Expressionists in New York City, Bush's canvases changed dramatically. Painters Eleven and after Bush developed his work and approach to abstraction through the 1950s. He was a member of Painters Eleven, an influential group founded by William Ronald in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. Critical at first, Greenberg became a mentor to Bush and encouraged him to refine his palette, technique, and approach. As a result of Greenberg's guidance, Bush became closely tied to Color Field Painting and Lyrical Abstraction. Bush's work is based on an abstract record of his perception. Rather than expecting the audience to recognize his subject or experience the use of forms in his paintings, he shares the emotion of that experience by slabs and streaks of color. Bush became friends with artists associated with color-field like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland and also Anthony Caro. As Painters Eleven disbanded in 1960, Bush moved on, and in the end became one of the most successful artist to come from this group. Jack Bush represented Canada at the 1967 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, and in 1976 the Art Gallery of Ontario toured a large retrospective of his work. He died in Toronto at the age of 68 on 24 January 1977. In 1979, two years later, the National Film Board of Canada released a one-hour documentary Jack Bush, directed by Murray Battle. Bush's son Terry is an award winning jingle writer, best known for singing and co-writing \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\", the theme for The Littlest Hobo. Influences One of his most important influences was Henri Matisse (1869-1954), a French artist who led the Fauvist movement about 1900 by pursuing expressive color throughout his career. Bush once said to his peer and friend Kenneth Noland, > \\"What I'd really like to do is hit Matisse's ball out of the park.\\" and Noland replied, > \\"Go ahead, Matisse won't mind at all.\\" Honors * Guggenheim Fellowship, 1968 * Royal Canadian Academy of Arts * Canada Post honored Jack Bush with a Canadian postage stamp and a souvenir sheet released on March 20, 2009.

While the game was closely played throughout, it is the game's conclusion that is most remembered. On fourth-and-goal, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker threw a touchdown pass to running back T. J. Duckett as time expired to win 26‚Äì24. Smoker had spiked the ball with one second showing on the clock to allow the Spartans to have one last play.

The Wolverines came into East Lansing with a 6‚Äì1 (4‚Äì0) record and a #6 ranking behind wins against Miami (Ohio), Western Michigan, Penn State, Iowa, and eventual Big Ten champion Illinois. Michigan was the only team in the Big Ten without a loss four games into the Big Ten season, and despite an early non-conference loss at Washington, the Wolverines were considered national title contenders. Michigan led the Big Ten in rushing defense, conceding just 54.4 yards per game, but looked to be challenged by Michigan State running back T. J. Duckett, who averaged 105.5 rushing yards per game going into the contest. In the previous week, linebacker Larry Foote set a Michigan school record with 7 tackles for a loss against Iowa and seemed poised to put serious pressure on the Spartan offense.

The Spartans had won three of the previous four meetings against the Wolverines in East Lansing. It was coach Bobby Williams' first home game against the Wolverines. Kickoff return specialist and wide receiver Herb Haygood led the nation in kickoff return average (33.2 yards per return) and looked to give the Wolverines a serious challenge on special teams.

ABC Sports carried the game live regionally with commentary from play- by-play announcer Brent Musburger, color commentator Gary Danielson, and sideline reporter Jack Arute. Scoring =1st Quarter= On the opening drive of the game Michigan State found itself in a fourth down situation on Michigan's 31 yard line and sent punter Craig Jarrett onto the field along with two wide receivers to attempt a fake punt. Although Jarrett's pass was incomplete, Michigan cornerback Marlin Jackson was flagged for pass interference for his coverage on Charles Rogers, which gave Michigan State a fresh set of downs and 15 extra yards. Two plays later, Smoker threw a 17-yard touchdown to Rogers in the back of the end zone to give the Spartans a 7‚Äì0 lead. On the ensuing drive, Michigan kicker Hayden Epstein made a school- record 57-yard field goal to put the Wolverines on the board and cut the lead to 7‚Äì3. =2nd Quarter= At 12:07 of the 2nd quarter, Michigan took its first lead on a 14-yard touchdown pass from John Navarre to Marquise Walker, capping an eight-play, 67-yard drive and making it 10‚Äì7. On 3rd and 4, 7:45 into the 2nd quarter, the Spartans were driving on the Wolverines 13-yard line. Smoker threw an incomplete pass to Rogers in the end zone, but Michigan was flagged for pass interference once again. The penalty gave Michigan State a first down with goal to go, and on the very next play, T. J. Duckett ran 2 yards up the middle for a touchdown that put the Spartans up 14‚Äì10. The Wolverines struck back on the next series, as Walker caught a 32-yard touchdown pass to complete an 80-yard drive and give Michigan a 17‚Äì14 lead. =3rd Quarter= The only scoring in the 3rd quarter came courtesy of Michigan State kicker Dave Rayner, who kicked a 17-yard field goal with 12 seconds left in the quarter to knot the score at 17. =4th Quarter= With 7:33 left, Rayner hit another 17-yard field goal that gave Michigan State a 20‚Äì17 lead. A Smoker fumble on the Michigan State 38 yard line was recovered by Michigan defensive tackle Grant Bowman with six minutes left. On the ensuing possession, Navarre threw a 20-yard touchdown to backup quarterback Jermaine Gonzales, who had lined up as a wide receiver, that gave the Wolverines a 24‚Äì20 lead. Final drive With 2:28 left in the fourth quarter, Michigan was forced to punt from deep in its own zone. Hayden Epstein's kick was his shortest of the day, a 28-yarder that gave the Spartans excellent field position at the Wolverines' 44 yard line. On first and second down, Smoker was sacked for two of the Wolverines' school- record 12 sacks. Following an incompletion, the Spartans faced 4th and 16 from midfield. On fourth down, Smoker's pass fell incomplete, but Michigan defensive back Jeremy LeSueur was flagged for grabbing the facemask of receiver Charles Rogers, giving the Spartans fifteen yards and an automatic first down. Two plays later, wide receiver Herb Haygood caught a pass over the middle for 17 yards and another first down. On 1st and 10, Smoker was sacked again by the Wolverine defense, but Michigan was flagged for having 12 men on the field. However, referees failed to stop the clock at the time of the penalty, forcing the Spartans to use their final timeout. Additionally, the referees incorrectly walked off the penalty from the spot of the result of the play, costing the Spartans four yards and a down, since the down should have been reset back to first and was not. After an incompletion on the resulting 2nd and 4 from the 12 yard line, LeSueur broke up a 3rd down pass intended for Duckett in the end zone to bring up 4th down. Facing 4th and 4, Smoker completed a slant up the middle to Duckett for 8 yards that resulted in a first and goal on the Michigan 3 yard line. Michigan State rushed to spike the ball on 1st down, stopping the clock with 17 seconds left. On second and goal, Smoker rolled to the right and ran the ball down to the two yard line, but was tackled inbounds, so the clock continued to run. With time running out, the Spartans frantically lined up to spike the ball; when they did so, the stadium clock showed a single second remaining. Michigan coaches, players, and the ABC broadcasters argued that the clock should have expired on the play and that the timekeeper, known as \\"Spartan Bob\\", purposely stopped the clock before the ball was grounded. Michigan commentator Frank Beckmann speculated that Michigan State had benefited from its home field advantage, even calling the unfolding controversy \\"criminal\\" on the air. On the ensuing play, Smoker lobbed a pass into the back of the end zone where it was caught by Duckett, giving the Spartans a 26‚Äì24 victory. Controversy Debates on the last remaining second continue to this day. Some contend that clock operator Bob Stehlin, known colloquially as \\"Spartan Bob\\", stopped the clock before the spike play had actually concluded, to give the Spartans one more chance. Stehlin subsequently received threatening phone calls. Stehlin has stated that seven different media outlets timed the play and concluded that hundredths of a second remained. Not all responses laid blame on the timekeeper. An editorial cartoonist at The Michigan Daily, the University of Michigan student newspaper, depicted the aftermath of the game with a Michigan player trying to explain to two referees that the clock ran out, but also holding a gun that he had used to shoot himself in the foot (implying that had they not made critical mistakes previously, the clock would have not been an issue). Fallout Three years after the game, Big Ten officials told The Detroit News that, upon further review, the clock operator acted appropriately. Dave Parry, the conference's coordinator of football officials, said, \\"that play, as much as we've put that under a high-powered microscope, was correct. We could not prove that timer wrong.\\" To prevent the controversy caused by this game and others, the Big Ten changed its timekeeping policy for the 2002 season, having previously studied changing the policy prior to the Michigan‚ÄìMichigan State game. Previously, the home team appointed an individual of their choosing to keep the official time in the press box. Now, time is kept on the field by a neutral official appointed by the Big Ten. In addition to agreeing to change its policy on timekeeping, the Big Ten began a study on the feasibility of an instant replay system in 2003. In 2004, the Big Ten was the first conference to begin a trial replay system for all games played in conference stadiums. In 2005, most NCAA Division I-A teams had the option of using instant replay for their games after the NCAA approved the Big Ten's proposal to allow individual conferences to experiment with their own replay systems. Finally, in 2006, instant replay became standard across all NCAA Division I-A conferences. Records *T.J.

After being released in 2010, he signed a short-term deal with Wolverhampton Wanderers the following year and then spent his last season at Hull City. Career Basso previously played for Ponte Preta and Atl√©tico Paranaense in his homeland before moving to England. He had an unsuccessful three-month trial with Arsenal before joining non-league sides St Albans City and Woking. He eventually signed for League One side Bristol City shortly after the 2005‚Äì06 campaign had begun, making his first team debut against Swindon Town on 11 November 2005. He quickly established himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper and was part of the team that won promotion to the Championship in the following season, also being crowned BBC West's Footballer of the Year.

M. Blume is an award-winning journalist and New York Times bestselling author. The daughter of a classical pianist and a journalist, she followed her father's footsteps into the newsroom, beginning her career at The Jordan Times in Amman and Cronkite Productions in New York City. She later became an off-air reporter and researcher for ABC News Nightline with Ted Koppel in Washington, D.C., where she helped cover the historic presidential election in 2000, the 9/11 attacks, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a myriad of other events and topics. The author of the recently published ‚ÄúFallout,‚Äù about John Hersey‚Äôs experience relating the horrors of Hiroshima, Blume now specializes in stories on historical cultural achievements, and has documented seminal moments in the careers of Jackson Pollock, Truman Capote, and Ernest Hemingway, among other greats. She contributes regularly to Vanity Fair, and her work has appeared in The New York Times, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, WSJ Magazine, Vogue, Town & Country, Departures, The Hollywood Reporter, The Paris Review Daily, Slate, and the Los Angeles Review of Books, among other publications. On June 7, 2016, Eamon Dolan Books / Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released Blume's new book, Everybody Behaves Badly: The True Story Behind Hemingway‚Äôs Masterpiece The Sun Also Rises to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun‚Äòs 1926 release. Reviewers have lauded Everybody Behaves Badly as ‚Äúessential ‚Ä¶ a page-turner,‚Äù ‚Äúmagnificently reported,‚Äù ‚Äúfiendishly readable,‚Äù ‚Äúriveting,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe best book on Hemingway in Paris since A Moveable Feast.‚Äù The book became New York Times best seller shortly after its publication. Everybody Behaves Badly documents the genesis of Hemingway‚Äôs career. In the summer of 1925, the now- iconic writer ‚Äî then twenty-five years old ‚Äî descended upon Pamplona for its infamous annual bullfight fiesta with a tempestuous entourage in tow, including a femme fatale British aristocrat, a brash, handsome heir who hailed from two of New York‚Äôs great Jewish fortunes, one of America‚Äôs most celebrated comedic writers, and a down-on-his-luck childhood friend with a penchant for cynical wit. The holiday quickly spiraled into a morass of sexual rivalry, gory spectacle, brutal hangovers, and black eyes ‚Äì and gave Hemingway the material he desperately needed to make his breakthrough as a novelist. Upon the release of The Sun Also Rises ‚Äì which essentially recast all of that bad behavior as high literature ‚Äî Hemingway was crowned the voice of his ‚Äúlost‚Äù generation and the leader of the modernist movement in fiction ‚Äì an honorific that still belongs to him today. Everybody Behaves Badly is the first book to tell the full story behind Hemingway‚Äôs earliest published novel and how it propelled him to enduring international fame. Blume‚Äôs myth-shattering account features the fascinating figures behind Hemingway‚Äôs classic in their own words, and brings 1920s Paris, Pamplona, and New York City alive in an rich and unprecedented way. She culled countless letters, interviews, essays, long- out-of-print memoirs, archives, and interviewed dozens of descendants of the characters‚Äô prototypes and the historical icons who played a vital role in bringing The Sun Also Rises to life ‚Äî including family members and friends of Hemingway, Jazz Age oracle F. Scott Fitzgerald, redoubtable editor Maxwell Perkins, humorist Donald Ogden Stewart, and many others. She shows how The Sun Also Rises not only immediately defined a generation, but colored the lives of Hemingway‚Äôs unwitting prototypes forever. Her book also explores how Hemingway carefully, relentlessly built his own public persona during this period, which has arguably remained one of America‚Äôs most successful cultural exports. At heart, Everybody Behaves Badly is the story of how Hemingway became Hemingway. Ms. Blume also serves as literary executor of editor, bookseller, and Lost Generation icon Sylvia Beach, founder and owner of Paris‚Äôs Shakespeare and Company bookstore and library, and original publisher of James Joyce‚Äôs Ulysses as a book. Blume‚Äôs previous nonfiction books include Let's Bring Back (2010), a cultural encyclopedia celebrating hundreds of forgotten-yet-delightful objects, pastimes, fashions, delectables, and personalities from bygone eras. It was deemed ‚Äúwhimsical ‚Ä¶ comical ‚Ä¶ [and] delightful‚Äù by The New Yorker and celebrated by scores of other magazines, newspapers, and broadcasts. Following the success of this initial volume, Chronicle released a top-selling series of topic-specific new editions of Let's Bring Back ‚Äì including Let's Bring Back: The Cocktail Edition (2012) and Let's Bring Back: The Lost Language Edition (2013). In addition, Blume is the author of It Happened Here (Thornwillow Press, 2011), a book detailing the raucous social history of New York City‚Äôs St. Regis Hotel. The book was the inaugural volume of Thornwillow‚Äôs new ‚ÄúLibretto series,‚Äù which showcasess the work of literary lions past and present, including Peter Matthiessen, Adam Gopnik, and Lewis Lapham. Blume has also collaborated on a variety of book projects with acclaimed photographers, including Vogue contributors Claiborne Swanson Frank (American Beauty, 2011, and Young Hollywood, 2014) and Stephan Wurth (Ghost Town, 2011). For young readers, Blume has authored four critically acclaimed novels, all published by Knopf. Her debut children‚Äôs novel, Cornelia and the Audacious Escapades of the Somerset Sisters, has sold over 300,000 copies. Upon the release of her third children‚Äôs novel, Tennyson, reviewers compared her to writers Flannery O‚ÄôConnor, Eudora Welty, and Truman Capote (‚ÄúBrilliant, unusual writing.‚Äù‚ÄîThe Chicago Tribune). Blume‚Äôs first collection of short stories for children, Modern Fairies, Dwarves, Goblins, and Other Nasties, was released in 2010; her second collection ‚Äì The Wondrous Journals of Wendell Wellington Wiggins ‚Äì debuted in 2012.

Vogue recently selected Blume as a founding member of the Vogue 100, an organization of ‚Äúinfluential decision makers and opinion leaders known for their distinctive taste in fashion and culture, [and who] personify the rising influence of women over the past several decades.‚Äù Her individualistic personal style has been showcased in many publications, including Vanity Fair; Elle; O, The Oprah Magazine; Women's Wear Daily; Style.com; and the websites of American Vogue and Vogue Italia.

It was a four-issue limited series written by Jim Starlin, penciled by Mike Mignola and lettered by John Workman. The story tells a story spanning the DC Universe involving a wide variety of major characters including Superman, Batman, and the New Gods. The series comprised four 48-page prestige format comic books. Plot summary =Book One: Discovery= In Book One: Discovery, Darkseid finds a comatose Metron and takes him captive. After going over Metron‚Äôs data, Darkseid makes a startling discovery. There is something out there more powerful than him and he needs help to conquer it. Darkseid goes to Highfather. An ambassador, Lonar, arrives on Earth and asks the President of the United States to help him contact Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter, Starfire, Etrigan, Green Lantern and \\"lastly, an old man with the unusual name of Mr. Blood.\\" Lonar takes them to New Genesis via Boom Tube, to meet Highfather. After they arrive, Darkseid appears and Superman attacks him, but is quickly thrown back. Orion and Lightray break up the fight and explain to a confused group of heroes that New Genesis and Apokolips have formed an alliance. Highfather tells Superman that the entire Universe is under threat, then informs the group about the origin of the Anti-Life Equation, New Genesis and Apokolips. Darkseid then tells the group that Metron was trying to discover new information about the Anti-Life Equation when his mind was shattered and he became comatose. The Martian Manhunter probes Metron‚Äôs mind to find out what he discovered and learns that the Anti-Life Equation is alive. As Metron tried to escape the Anti-Life Equation's dimension, it attacked him and four \\"aspects\\" of the ALE were thrust into the DCU Earth's universe. Metron's Mobius Chair tracked the flight paths of the four aspects and Darkseid tells the heroes that they are currently located on Earth, Rann, Thanagar and Xanshi. If the aspects can destroy any two of those planets, then the Milky Way will collapse on itself. Darkseid then gives the heroes weapons he designed to capture the aspects and divides the group into teams. Orion and Superman will go to Thanagar, Lightray and Starfire to Rann, Batman and Forager to Earth and The Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern to Xanshi. The separate teams all arrive at their respective planets. Immediately upon arrival on Earth Batman makes a phone call to \\"a friend\\" requesting this unknown person keep an eye on Darkseid. Back on New Genesis, Mr. Blood asks what his part is in all this. Darkseid and Highfather then reveal an imprisoned Etrigan. =Book Two: Disaster= In Book Two: Disaster, Superman and Orion arrive on Thanagar where they are met with force - the Anti-Life Aspect has seized control of the Thanagarians' minds. As they proceed towards the location of the ALA, they are again attacked. Meanwhile, Green Lantern and the Martian Manhunter arrive on Xanshi to discover that the population is suffering from an airborne communicable virus that's killing them, and meet a scientist who has been trying to discover a cure. Using his Power Ring, John Stewart creates a cure from the scientists‚Äô experiments. Later, John and J'onn discover that the ALA has tapped into the planet's core and controls the very planet itself. As they head to confront the ALA, it creates a hurricane in their path and strikes J'onn with a bolt of lightning, destroying the Anti-Life Catcher weapon built by Darkseid. During this time, John Stewart has become increasingly overconfident and builds a new Anti-Life Catcher with his ring. The two then move on to face the ALA. John places a protective bubble around J'onn and moves him away from the battle, telling him that he can handle it alone. He comes across the ALA and its bomb, only to discover that the bomb is yellow (which the Green Lantern rings are powerless against). The blast knocks GL into space and continues until the entire planet is destroyed. Due to the nature of the Power Ring, both heroes survive the blast. The Martian Manhunter finds Green Lantern on a piece of rock in space and tells him, \\"Thanks to your arrogance and stupidity, I have now seen two worlds die. I will never forgive you for this.\\" Meanwhile on New Genesis, Darkseid and Highfather reveal to Jason Blood that in order to secure the barrier between our dimension and the ALE's, Blood must once more reunite with The Demon, Etrigan. On Earth, Batman and Forager arrive in the Batcave and discuss their strategy. Batman deduces that the ALA is going to use Earth's computer network to destroy our planet. Alfred makes Forager a new uniform and Batman discovers that the ALA is in Arizona. On Rann, Lightray and Starfire try to find Adam Strange and discover that the population of Rann is trying to kill one another. The two heroes meet up with Strange and the three of them begin the search for the ALA. They arrive at the loading docks and discover the ALA's bomb. They begin the search for the ALA by splitting up. Adam Strange is knocked out and Lightray and Starfire meet back up in an attempt to find the ALA. Back on New Genesis, Jason Blood and Etrigan become one again and Darkseid smiles. =Book Three: Decisions= In Book Three: Decisions, Lightray and Starfire receive word about Xanshi while caring for the injured Adam Strange. Lightray leaves Starfire with Adam to search for the ALA. Starfire then discovers an \\"oily substance\\" which attacks her. Lightray, finding nothing in his search, returns to find Starfire unconscious along with Adam Strange. Lightray is attacked by the \\"oily substance\\" which turns out to be the ALA. He is knocked out just as Starfire wakes up. Starfire takes both men to safety and confronts the ALA. Lightray wakes up and sees an unconscious Starfire in the grip of the ALA and 14 seconds remaining on the countdown. At three seconds Starfire, who was feigning injury, suddenly flies up and grabs Lightray while the fiery flight emission she produces ignites the ALA, blowing it and the bomb up before it had a chance to arm itself. While outside, the three heroes notice the ALA, in its pure form, flying into space. Meanwhile on Thanagar, Superman and Orion split up to go after the ALA. Orion will proceed ahead and keep the Thanagarians busy while Superman burrows beneath the ground in order to sneak in. Superman finds the bomb, but is attacked by a gigantic robot that the ALA is using as a host. Superman defeats the ALA and returns to the surface expecting to find hundreds of Thanagarians ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù. Instead, he finds hundreds, possibly thousands dead... at the hands of Orion, who claims that he had to do it on order for Superman to fight the ALA without distraction. Superman hits Orion, knocking him off his Astro-Harness. Orion returns to New Genesis; Superman remains on Thanagar to bury the dead. Back on Earth, Batman and Forager arrive in Moosejaw, Arizona. Forager suspects that the ALA will be using a dead Gotham City police officer as a host, but Batman disagrees. He ran into a Parademon a while back in the Gotham sewers and believes the ALA will be inhabiting its body. Back on New Genesis, Darkseid is losing faith in the heroes‚Äô abilities to conquer the four ALA‚Äôs. He tells Highfather that the time is now to attack it head on. While Highfather is contemplating Darkseid‚Äôs plan, someone appears and has been reading Highfather's mind. He tells Highfather that he knows how to win the battle with the ALE... let Darkseid have his way. Darkseid then reveals a portion of his plan to Etrigan and the Demon reluctantly agrees to help him, thinking he will save the galaxy. John Stewart, the Martian Manhunter and Orion arrive back to New Genesis and are greeted by Highfather. John Stewart walks away, torn up inside by his failure at Xanshi. Highfather tells J‚Äôonn to keep an eye on him. Meanwhile, Darkseid has connected a device to himself and Etrigan that will allow Darkseid to manipulate Etrigan's powers. He flips a switch, they become one for an instant and then they are both moved into the ALE‚Äôs dimension, where they find the ALE waiting for them. The unknown person who appeared to Highfather reappears as Orion and Highfather find that Darkseid and Etrigan have left to attack the ALE. This unknown man tells them that they can still win, but they must join him in order to do it. =Book Four: Death= In Book Four: Death, Batman and Forager disable the bomb and crush the Parademon under 2 tons of equipment. Joe Bester, the Gotham City Cop, then attacks the two heroes. He is stronger and faster than Batman expected and it‚Äôs not until Forager cuts his head off that they know why... Joe Bester was a robot. Suddenly, the ALA/Parademon stands up, stuns Batman by slamming him into the ground and starts choking him to death after breaking his leg. Batman starts to pass out, unable to break the ALA‚Äôs grip when suddenly, Forager‚Äôs shield hits the ALA in the back, forcing it to drop Batman. After knocking Forager unconscious, the ALA repairs the bomb. Forager wakes up and after briefly attacking the ALA, rushes over to the control station and slams his shield into it, causing an explosion that destroys it before it can arm. Forager dies in the explosion, giving his life to save not only the Earth, but the galaxy as well. In the meantime, Darkseid and Etrigan discover that the ALE is more powerful than first thought. It appears that they are both about to die when Highfather and Orion appear before them, led by Doctor Fate, who was enlisted by Batman in the first issue by phone call. Dr. Fate saves Darkseid and Etrigan, then combines their collective power in the ‚ÄúCinque of Cosmic Power‚Äù and takes the fight straight to the ALE. There, Dr. Fate reveals that the only way to contain the ALE is by creating a ‚Äúmystic firebreak‚Äù. This spell would destroy the dimension they are in, which is a bridge between where the ALE is and the reality that Earth is in. A huge explosion occurs and Dr. Fate, Highfather, Orion, Etrigan and Darkseid all return to New Genesis, with the ALE unable to follow them. Darkseid, released from control, is furious with Dr. Fate for \\"making a puppet out of him\\" and threatens retaliation, but Superman tells Darkseid he would have to take them all on to do so. Darkseid apologizes and walks away. Meanwhile in another area of New Genesis, John Stewart has used his power ring to pick up a yellow gun, then ordered his ring to travel 20 light years away and come back when he calls it - if he doesn‚Äôt call it within one hour, he instructs it to find Hal Jordan. The ring flies away and with tears in his eyes, John Stewart puts the gun to his head, while the Martian Manhunter watches from a distance. Finally, he removes the gun from his head. J‚Äôonn asks him why he didn‚Äôt do it and then begins to chastise him for being a failure and not being worthy of the ring. John looks up at him angrily, drops the gun, calls for his Ring, stands and says, ‚ÄúScrew you J‚Äôonzz!‚Äù The Martian Manhunter smiles as he watches John Stewart walk away. Later, Superman and Lightray appear carrying a badly beaten Batman and the body of Forager. When Orion insults Forager and refers to him as a \\"bug,\\" an enraged Batman punches Orion and screams, ‚ÄúHis name was Forager!!‚Äù Orion walks away and as the heroes prepare to return to Earth, they discover that Darkseid is missing as are the weapons that had the imprisoned ALA‚Äôs within them. On Apokolips, Darkseid shows Desaad a small piece of pure Anti-Life and on New Genesis, Highfather instructs Orion to escort Forager‚Äôs body back to the Insect Empire in hopes that it will teach him about tolerance.

Students in every grade level participate in at least one stage performance, including an annual fall play and spring musical for seventh and eighth graders. Character education Character education and service learning are integral parts of life at Norwood and have been so since the school's founding in 1952. Frances Marsh started Norwood on the very idea that a school should stand for and teach a core set of values. She felt strongly that a school has a responsibility to help students ‚Äúgain an intelligent awareness of the world around them; a sense of their own worth; and a recognition of the obligation to share that worth with society and the community in which they live.‚Äù Norwood has a ‚ÄúValue of the Month‚Äù curriculum and begins every month with a lesson about character. The school's motto is ‚ÄúHow you lead your life matters.‚Äù Service learning is integral to the Norwood experience at all grade levels. Athletics Students in grades K-6 take P.E. four times a week; fifth and sixth graders have the option to participate in interscholastic athletics in addition to their P.E. class. Seventh and eighth graders fulfill their physical education requirements by participating on an athletic team, in Norwood's outdoor education program Summit, or through other P.E. offerings such as strength and conditioning. Campus and facilities Norwood's 38-acre campus is located in Bethesda, Maryland at the corner of River Road and Bradley Boulevard, less than a mile from the Capital Beltway. The property features two athletic fields for soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey, a baseball field, softball field, a smaller soccer field for the youngest students, outdoor education ropes course, archaeological dig site, and a learning garden and pond.

History Norwood was founded as an Episcopal parish day school. In early 1952, in response to requests from parishioners, the rector of St. John's Church, Norwood Parish, asked Frances Marsh, the director of the church's Sunday School, to start a parish primary school. The Vestry Resolution founding the parish school indicated that preference would be given to families from the Norwood Parish and then, as space was available, opportunity would be given to other church families in the community. That fall, the Norwood Parish School opened in the basement of St. John's Church with four teachers and 40 children in grades K-2. Third grade was added the following year. As a church school, it held religious services led by the rector and operated under St John's Vestry. The school prospered under Frances Marsh, though the small amount of space at St. John's limited both the possibilities for more school activities and the number of children who could attend. This led to the establishment of Norwood Inc., a non-profit corporation founded by Marsh and parents with the intention of finding a larger building. Unhappy with this effort to relocate the school, the church vestry dismissed Frances Marsh as director of Norwood Parish School in March 1970. The families at the parish school helped Marsh establish the new Norwood School in temporary quarters for two years before its move to the current location on River Road in Bethesda in January 1972. Norwood has operated continuously since then as a non-profit, independent educational institution without religious affiliation. Norwood moved to its current hilltop location in early January 1972. The Steuart Building, named in honor of Norwood grandparent Esther T. Steuart, first opened to students in January 1972. The following year, the Board of Trustees decided to expand the School through the sixth grade. A capital fund drive was launched for the purpose of erecting a new building to accommodate the School's upper three grades, a science laboratory, administrative offices, and a multi-purpose gymnasium. The fund drive was a success and the new building was finished in 1975. It was named after Frances Marsh. In August 1995 the School acquired the adjacent estate which provided ample room for expansion. Subsequently, after two years of deliberation informed by Board committee work, faculty/staff planning, and parent meetings and surveys, the Board of Trustees made the decision in May 1996 to expand the School to include grades seven and eight. The first seventh grade class opened in September 1998, followed by the first eighth grade in September 1999. That same month, the school opened its new middle school and athletic buildings, which provided classroom space for fifth through eighth grades, a library, two science laboratories, choral and instrumental music rooms, two light-filled art rooms, lunch facilities, two basketball courts, a training room, locker rooms, and athletic offices. Since its founding in 1952, Norwood has had five heads of school: *Frances Brandis Marsh, 1952-1977 *Thomas C. Hudnut, 1977-1982 *Miriam Fulton Block, 1982-1983 (Interim Head) *Richard T.

It is set in Israel and follows the formula set by Die Hard rather closely. Additionally, the last act of the film also borrows heavily from the U.S. blockbuster Speed, which was released just two years earlier. Plot Sergeant Dutton Hatfield is working for the American embassy. His latest assignment is to escort a supposed team of scientists inside the Research Development Institute facility outside Tel Aviv, Israel. However, the scientists are revealed to be terrorists in disguise, led by Colonel Baron. Baron is seeking retribution for his humiliation when he had an ideological disagreement with his superior officer General Miller, over the merits of the Gulf War, and Miller forced him to retire after Miller became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Baron and his eight men, including an insider scientist named Dr. Berg, are seeking a sample of a deadly virus that is being developed inside the facility, and plan to use both the virus and a set of five pre-arranged bombs in Washington, D.C. as leverage to arrange an escape and a payment of $510 million. Once the takeover of the facility begins, Hatfield quickly discovers the plot and eliminates three terrorists, while the remaining five take the only four surviving scientists - Pawklowsky (Andre Kashkar), Elaine Starkov (Bridget Marks), Eliot Stein (Larry Smith), and Abrahams (Ami Dayan) - as hostages. Hatfield then meets Dr. Allie Levin, the scientist behind the development of the virus for biological warfare, and with the help of a communications officer named Ira, tries to have her escorted out through the evacuation tunnels in the basement. However, they encounter two more terrorists in the basement; Hatfield manages to kill both, but not before one of them guns down Ira, after he acts as a human shield to defend Dr. Levin. After Ira's death, Hatfield and Levin bond over their respective separations with their spouses; Levin's husband, a pilot in the United States Air Force, was killed in the Gulf War, while Hatfield's wife left him for his former best friend. Hatfield and Levin quickly become attracted to each other. Baron then orders his ruthless right-hand man Ramos to begin executing the hostages, starting with Dr. Abrahams. In order to avoid more dead hostages, Hatfield agrees to a swap with Ramos to exchange the cylinder containing the virus with the second hostage, Dr. Stein. However, once Ramos retrieves the cylinder, he kills Stein and flees. Unbeknownst to Hatfield, another remaining terrorist named Gallo has taken Dr. Levin and brought her back to be with the other hostages. Baron orders Dr. Berg to prepare a sample of the toxin as a demonstration, only to betray Berg and demonstrate its lethal effects on him; after smashing the vial containing the sample and ripping off Berg's gas mask, the toxin kills him within seconds, thus satisfying Baron. Baron and Ramos take Levin, Pawklowsky, and Starkov aboard a bus after both General Miller and Israeli Colonel Gideon have negotiated a cleared roadway to the airport, with $500 million being wired to Baron's designated account and the remaining $10 million loaded onto the waiting plane, piloted by one final terrorist. Gallo pursues Hatfield in security vans down the numerous evacuation tunnels, culminating in both of them crashing in the facility's loading dock, with Gallo's van exploding and killing him. Colonel Gideon arrives in a helicopter just in time to pick up Hatfield, and the two pursue the bus. Ramos kills both Starkov and Pawklowsky to try to convince the soldiers to back off, but Hatfield leaps onto the roof of the bus anyway and drops in through the roof hatch. After a brief fight with Ramos, Hatfield gains the upper hand and puts him in a chokehold just as the bus arrives at the airport. Hatfield tries to force Baron to stop the bus by threatening to kill Ramos, only for Baron to shoot Ramos himself. Hatfield then attacks Baron and knocks him unconscious at the wheel, and Hatfield and Levin both jump out with the cylinder just before the bus crashes into a parked fuel truck, exploding and killing Baron. Hatfield then notices the final surviving terrorist at the getaway plane, who has taken Hatfield's son hostage. The terrorist shoots Hatfield in the shoulder, only for Gideon to snipe him from the chopper. The wounded Hatfield reunites with both his son and Levin.  Cast  * Jeff Speakman as Sgt.

Cordance is a measure of regional brain activity. It is computed using quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) measures of brain wave patterns in an algorithm developed at the UCLA Laboratory of Brain, Behavior, and Pharmacology by Drs. Andrew Leuchter and Ian Cook. The cordance algorithm includes steps of (a) reattribution of EEG power, (b) spatial normalization of absolute and relative power, and (c) combination of the transformed absolute and transformed relative power to yield the cordance values themselves. In comparison with other QEEG measures, such as absolute power or relative power, cordance appears to have a superior correlation with regional brain perfusion, one of the other standard measures of regional brain activity. Because cordance is derived from EEG signals, assessments of brain function with cordance do not require the use of radioactive tracer molecules, as is the case with some other functional neuroimaging methods (PET or SPECT scanning). Cordance has been applied to studying brain activity in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major area of study has been major depressive disorder, in efforts to develop biomarkers that could help guide treatment. This line of work was begun in the mid 1990s at UCLA and is now the subject of replication studies at other medical centers.

Born in Killarney, County Kerry, Cooper was born into a strong Gaelic football family. His father, Mike Cooper, had a strong involvement with the Dr. Crokes club, serving as a minor and junior selector. Colm's nephew Mark was a part of the 2018 All Ireland winning Kerry Minor team, a competition he himself never won.http://www.kerrygaa.ie/news_detail/10043216/ Cooper played competitive Gaelic football as a student at St. Brendan's College, however, his tenure coincided with a downturn in fortunes for the college. He first appeared for the Dr. Crokes club at underage levels, before making his debut with the senior team in 2000. An All-Ireland medal winners with the club in 2017, Cooper has also won five Munster medals and six county senior championship medals. Cooper made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he was selected for the Kerry minor team in 2000. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team, culminating with the winning of a Munster medal in 2001. Cooper subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning a Munster medal in 2002. By this stage he had also joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 2002 league. Over the course of the next fifteen years, Cooper won five All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 2004, back-to-back championships in 2006 and 2007, a fourth title in 2009 and a final championship as a non-playing substitute in 2014 due to injury. He also won nine Munster medals, three National Football League medals and was named Texaco Footballer of the Year in 2004. He played his last game for Kerry against Dublin in August 2016 before announcing his retirement from inter-county football on 4 April 2017. After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 2002, Cooper was also included on the team in 2004. He ended his career without a Railway Cup medal. Cooper was first selected for the Ireland international rules football team in 2005, however, he declined to be included on subsequent squads for the competition. Even during his playing days Cooper came to be recognised as one of the greatest players of all time. He was named Texaco Footballer of the Year in 2004, however, he never collected the All-Star Footballer of the Year title. In spite of this he won eight All-Star awards. Cooper released his autobiography called Gooch The Autobiography in October 2017. On 27 October 2017, Cooper became the first GAA player to have a testimonial dinner which was held at the Intercontinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Playing career =Club= Cooper helped Dr. Crokes win the 2000 Kerry Senior Football Championship at the age of 17, beating An Ghaeltacht in the final. Dr. Crokes reached the Kerry Senior county final again in 2005 and 2006, but were defeated on both occasions by South Kingdom. However, South Kingdom are a divisional side and not a club so Dr. Crokes qualified to represent the Kerry in the Munster Senior Club Football Championship. In 2006 Dr. Crokes won the Munster Club Championship, beating The Nire of Waterford in the final. They advanced to the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship after beating Moorefield of Kildare after a replay in the semi-final, and faced Crossmaglen of Armagh in the 2007 All-Ireland Club final. The game finished in a draw. Crossmaglen won the replay to claim their fourth All-Ireland title. In 2010 Cooper played against Austin Stacks in Tralee in the Championship final finally giving Dr. Crokes the title after the three losses in finals. Cooper and Crokes were back again the year after to win back to back county titles. They secured the Kerry title in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to make it five in a row. In February 2014, Cooper suffered a cruciate ligament rupture in the All- Ireland Club Championship semi-final against Castlebar Mitchels which kept him out of action for the remainder of 2014. On 27 November 2016, Cooper won his fifth Munster club title beating the Nire in the final by 3-15 to 0-6 with Cooper scoring two points. Dr. Crokes went on to reach the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Final on 17 March 2017 and won the game against Slaughtneil by 1-9 to 1-7 at Croke Park. Cooper scored 1-2 in the final and claimed his first All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship title. =Inter-county= Cooper was first called up to the Kingdom team in 2002 and made his National Football League debut against Laois. He continued his rise in that year's Championship, making his debut against Limerick on 12 May en route to the 2002 All-Ireland final, where they faced Armagh. Armagh defeated Kerry in the final by 1-12 to 0-14 with Copper scoring a point. Cooper was awarded his first All Star award in 2002. In 2003 Kerry won a Munster Senior Football Championship, but were knocked out of the All-Ireland Championship by Tyrone at the semi-final stage losing by 0-13 to 0-6. 2004 proved to be a good year for Cooper. Kerry won the 2004 National League, with victory over Galway in the final on 2 May. They also defended their Munster title, before going on to win the All-Ireland Championship ‚Äì beating Mayo in the final by 1-20 to 2-9. Cooper scored 1‚Äì05 in the final, including a goal where he caught a ball and ran at the Mayo defence before slotting the ball low to the net. Cooper received his second All Star in 2004 and was named the Texaco Footballer of the Year. Kerry won their third consecutive Munster Championship in 2005, beating old rivals Cork in the decider. Kerry reached an All-Ireland final, this time against Tyrone. After a bright start, Cooper was injured in a clash with Tyrone goalkeeper Pascal McConnell which limited his involvement. Tyrone won the game 1‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì10. Cooper won a third All Star award in 2005. In the 2006 Championship Cork defeated Kerry in the Munster final. Kerry advanced to the All-Ireland final, where they once again met Mayo. Kerry won the game by 13 points and Cooper was again one of Kerry's main contributors scoring 1‚Äì02. He was the Kerry captain for part of that year, although the other captain Declan O'Sullivan was restored as captain for the All-Ireland final. After winning the game, the Sam Maguire Cup was lifted by both O' Sullivan and Cooper. In 2007 Cooper played with Kerry regaining their Munster Championship title after an enthralling game against Cork, which Kerry won 1‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì13. Having been quiet for long spells, he burst into life and in a five-minute period scored 1‚Äì02. After beating Dublin by two points in the semi-final, Kerry progressed to face their bitter rivals Cork in the first ever all- Munster All-Ireland final. Kerry comfortably beat Cork 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì09, to become the first team to retain the title since Cork themselves 17 years before. Cooper got the goal that put Kerry in the driving seat, rising to fist the ball over the onrushing Alan Quirke. Cooper finished the game with 1-05. He received his fourth All Star and was nominated as one of three contenders for 2007 Footballer of the Year. He was also named on the GPA Team of the Year. Kerry reached the 2008 National League final, but were beaten by Derry on a 2-13 to 2-9 scoreline. Cork beat Kerry in the 2008 Munster final. Kerry nevertheless advanced to the 2008 All-Ireland final, to face Tyrone for the third time in six years. Tyrone once again came out on top winning by four points. Cooper scored six points in the final and won his fifth All Star award that year and was once again named on the GPA Team of the Year. In 2009, Cooper was dropped from the starting Kerry 15 for the qualifier game against Antrim on 26 July, due to a breach of team discipline. Cooper came on against Antrim and made an immediate impact notching 4 frees in another win for Kerry. Kerry progressed to face Dublin in the quarter final on 3 August, a Dublin side who had won their fifth Leinster Championships in a row. Within a minute Cooper had Kerry in front with a goal and were 1‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì03 ahead at the break. The game ended with Kerry on top and Cooper silently announcing his return to form with a haul of 1‚Äì08. Cooper and Kerry brushed Meath aside in a low-key semi-final before they faced against Cork in the final. Kerry won the final 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì09, with Cooper scoring six points and winning his fourth All Ireland Medal. In April 2010, Cooper sustained a serious eye injury in a NFL Division 1 win over Monaghan. He tore a duct in one of his eyes: doctors in Kerry expressed concern about his condition. He collided with Monaghan defender Darren Hughes after seven minutes and required treatment on and off the field. However, he returned to the Kerry team for the championship. After winning the Munster Championship, beating Limerick in the final, Kerry progressed to the All-Ireland quarter final, facing historic rivals Down but lost by 1-16 to 1-10 with Copper scoring seven points in the game. The 2011 championship ended in final day disappointment for Cooper. Kerry, in control of the final having been 4 points up in the closing minutes, succumbed to rivals Dublin, who outscored Kerry by 1‚Äì3 to 1 point in the final stages to win the cup for the first time since 1995. The 2012 championship saw Kerry lose to Cork in the Munster semi-final but go on to play Donegal in the All- Ireland quarter-final on 5 August. Kerry lost the game by 1-12 to 1-10 with Copper scoring four points. Kerry won the Munster Championship in 2013 with Copper getting 1-3 in the final on 7 July at Fitzgerald Stadium. Kerry defeated Cavan in the All-Ireland quarter-finals before losing to Dublin in the semi-final by 3-18 to 3-11 with Copper scoring four points in the game. In February 2014, Cooper suffered a cruciate ligament rupture in the All-Ireland Club Championship semi-final against Castlebar Mitchels which kept him out of action for most of 2014. He was named as a substitute for Kerry in the 2014 All-Ireland Final against Donegal which Kerry went on to win by 2-9 to 0-12. Copper won his eight Munster Championship medal on 18 July 2015 when Kerry defeated Cork in the final by 1-11 to 1-6 after a replay. They defeated Kildare in the All-Ireland quarter-finals by 7-16 to 0-10 with Copper getting 2-3 before defeating Tyrone in the semi-final by 0-18 to 1-11, Copper getting two points. In the final against Dublin on 20 September, Copper scored didn't get on the score sheet as Kerry lost by 0-9 to 0-12 in very wet conditions. In 2016, Kerry reached the Munster Final again and played Tipperary, winning by 3-17 to 2-10. Cooper went off injured in the first half of the game with a collarbone injury. He missed the quarter final win against Clare but returned for the epic semi-final against Dublin on 28 August. Dublin won by 0-22 to 2-14 after coming back from conceding two first half goals. Cooper scored five points in what would turn out to be his last game for Kerry. On the 4 April 2017, Cooper announced his retirement from inter county football at the age of 33. In 85 Championship games for Kerry he scored 23 goals and 283 points, and in 60 league games he scored 12 goals and 165 points. =International rules= Cooper has represented Ireland in the International Rules Series, in 2005. However, he has declined any invitation to represent Ireland in the hybrid game since, as he claims not to have enjoyed the experience; 2005 was a year when the series was marred by violence and intimidation. =Province= Cooper played for Munster in the Railway Cup in 2002 and 2004.

A former referee, Watt was appointed secretary in December 1895 and held the position until 1935. He did not control the team's selection, so technically he was not the manager in a modern sense; this role was unheard of, and the club was run by a committee, overseen by the club secretary. Newcastle's first official manager was Andy Cunningham in 1930. Watt was also a member of the committee that owned the club at the time. He was very influential, referred to as \\"The Guv'nor\\". He was a portly figure with a handlebar moustache. Newcastle United 1897/98-Season. FG Watts is middle row left A Scotsman, Watt's first involvement in football came with the 3rd E.R.V. club in Edinburgh, the precursor of the former league side St Bernard's, where he combined his playing role with that of club secretary. He was later appointed secretary of the Edinburgh (later East of Scotland) Football Association before leaving for Tyneside.St.Bernard's Part 1 Watt had great ambitions for Newcastle. Upon arrival he declared \\"We're going to be the best team in the country.\\" The Edwardian Newcastle side dominated the league with a side assembled entirely by Watt, who also signed players such as Hughie Gallacher, Colin Veitch and Stan Seymour throughout his 37 years at the club, players who are still considered legends today (however, he initially turned down Seymour, explaining that the future Mr. Newcastle was \\"too small to play football\\"). During his time at Newcastle, the club won the old First Division four times in 1905, 1907, 1909 and 1927. They won the FA Cup in 1910 and 1924 and were finalists on four more occasions, in 1905, 1906, 1908 and 1911. When he retired in 1930, his son of the same name took on his job with the club until his own death in 1950. For most of his tenure Watt's trainer, who retired along with him in 1930, was James Quar McPherson, who took on the role in 1903.

A navigational aid (navaid), also known as aid to navigation (ATON), is any sort of marker which aids the traveler in navigation, usually nautical or aviation travel. Common types of such aids include lighthouses, buoys, fog signals, and day beacons. Definition According to the glossary of terms in the United States Coast Guard Light list, an Aid to Navigation (ATON) is any device external to a vessel or aircraft specifically intended to assist navigators in determining their position or safe course, or to warn them of dangers or obstructions to navigation.  Lateral markers Lateral marks indicate the edge of the channel. The standards are defined by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). Approaching harbour port a vessel leaves port hand marks to port (left) and starboard hand marks to starboard (right). Port hand marks are cylindrical, starboard marks are conical. If the mark is a pillar or spar shape, then a topmark is fitted which is either cylindrical or conical as appropriate. IALA divides the world into two regions: A and B. Region B is the Americas (excluding Greenland) along with Japan, Korea and the Philippines. Region A is the rest of the world. In region A port marks are red and starboard marks green. In region B port marks are green and starboard red. Where marks are numbered red marks have even numbers and green marks have odd numbers. =Preferred channel marks= Where a channel divides the mark at the junction is called a \\"preferred channel mark\\" or \\"junction buoy\\". The mark has the colour and shapes corresponding to the preferred channel with a band of the other colour to indicate it is the other hand mark for the subsidiary channel. In IALA region A where a minor channel branches off to port the mark at the junction would be a red cylinder with a green band. The red cylinder is a port hand mark for the main channel, the green band indicates a starboard mark for the minor channel. In IALA region B the colours (but not shapes) are reversed. Cardinal marks Cardinal marks warn of a danger (wrecks, shoals, bends, spits etc.) and indicate the safe water past the danger. There are four varieties: north, east, south and west. A north cardinal mark is placed to the north of a hazard and indicates safe water is to the north of the mark. East, south and west are placed accordingly. Cardinal marks are yellow and black with two cones at top marks. There is no difference between IALA region A and B. Other IALA defined marks =Isolated danger mark= Black with a horizontal red band and two black balls as a top mark. The mark indicates a danger (shoal, rock, wreck etc.) which is isolated with safe water all around. =Safe water mark= Red and white vertical stripes with a single red sphere for a top mark. It indicates that there is safe water all around it. The usual use is to indicate the start of a channel or port approach. =New danger= Indicates a newly discovered or created danger that is not yet marked on charts (or in update notices thereto). The mark is used for a short time until the danger is either removed or else marked conventionally with lateral or cardinal marks. The mark has blue and yellow vertical stripes and a yellow and blue light. The topmark is a vertical yellow cross. =Special marks= Yellow with an \\"X\\" topmark. Used to mark other features such as swimming areas, anchorages, pipelines. The exact reason is marked on charts. =Sector lights= A sector light is one which shows different colours depending upon the angle of approach. They are commonly used to indicate the safe channel (white) and show red or green if the vessel is out of the safe channel. IALA requires the light colours to follow the appropriate region (A or B) colour scheme. Other markers IALA Region B nautical chart. There are also other markers that give information other than the edges of safe waters. Most are white with orange markings and black lettering. They are used to give direction and information, warn of hazards and destructions, mark controlled areas, and mark off-limits areas. These ATONs do not mark traffic channels. On non-lateral markers, there are some shapes that show certain things: ;Squares: show information, including places to find food, supplies, and repairs. They sometimes show directions. ;Diamonds: warn about dangers like rocks, construction, dams, or stumps. ;Circles: mark a controlled area such as no wake, idles speed, speed limit, or ski zone. ;Crossed diamonds: show areas off limits to all boats, like swimming areas and dams. AIS AtoNs AtoNs can be integrated with Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS transmitted form an actual aid (buoy, lighthouse etc.) is termed a \\"Real AIS AtoN\\". If it is impractical to equip the AtoN with an AIS transponder an AIS shore station can be assigned to transmit AIS messages on behalf of the AtoN. This is known as a \\"Synthetic ATON\\". Synthetic AtoNs can be either \\"Monitored Synthetic AtoNs\\" or \\"Predicted Synthetic AtoNs\\". The former have a link between the AtoN so that the AIS station can confirm the AtoNs status. The latter have no link and the AIS system just predicts that the AtoN is where it should be. If there is no real AtoN (such as for the short term marking of a wreck) then a \\"Virtual AIS AtoN\\" is used. Each AIS AtoN must have a unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number. Synthetic and virtual AIS AtoNs mark their messages as repeats to indicate that the location of the transmitter is not the location of the AtoN. Lead marks and lights Triangle shaped lead marks with lights. Lead marks (as in \\"leading a ship into a safe place\\") and lights are fixed markers that are laterally displaced to allow a mariner to navigate a fixed channel along the preferred route. They are also known as \\"channel markers\\". They can normally be used coming into and out of the channel. When lit, they are also usable at night. Customarily, the upper mark is up-hill from the lower (forward) mark. The mariner will know the geometry of the marks/lights from the navigational chart and can understand that when \\"open\\" (not one above the other) the ship needs to be navigated to \\"close\\" the marks (so one is above the other) and be in the preferred line of the channel. In some cases, the lead marks/lights are provided by lasers, as in the laser channel under the Tasman Bridge on the Derwent River at Hobart, Tasmania.

It was acquired two years later by Boeing Air Transport. Early history Pacific Air Transport (PAT) was formed in January 1926 by Vern C. Gorst, an Oregon bus line operator. He saw the potential competition that would arise from the award by the United States Post Office Department of contracts to carry airmails. Airmail Route CAM 8 was planned by the USPO to carry the post from Seattle, Washington to Los Angeles, California via several intermediate cities. Gorst arranged for the route to be carefully surveyed by T. Claude Ryan in one of his new Ryan M-1 aircraft. This was because the airmail aircraft would have to traverse the 7,000 ft Siskiyou Mountains on the Oregon-California border. Early operations An airworthy Ryan M-1 mailplane in Pacific Air Transport markings at the Historic Aircraft Restoration Museum A P.A.T. Travel Air 3000 Gorst's new airline successfully bid for Route CAM 8 and contracted to purchase a fleet of ten Ryan M-1 mailplanes. These had a four-seat enclosed cabin because Gorst planned to carry fare-paying passengers as well as mail and express parcels. The service was inaugurated on 15 September 1926 after arrangements had been made for the provision of makeshift lights and beacons, and persuading the Standard Oil Company to paint the names of towns on the roofs of its buildings. Despite these precautions, by the end of the winter, three of the M-1 aircraft had been lost. The hardy passengers had to pay $132 for the doubtful privilege of being crammed in among the mailbags for the 18-hour flights. Intermediate landings were made for fuel and mail at Portland and Medford in Oregon and San Francisco, Fresno and Bakersfield in California. The route was operated daily in each direction. Acquisition by Boeing Air Transport Pacific Air Transport's main north-south airmail and passenger route continued in operation throughout 1927. However, Gorst did not make comfortable profits as the airmail loads were not as bulky as on some other CAM routes. He therefore sought the help of aviation entrepreneurs. Bill Boeing proved to be interested in the airline and his Boeing Air Transport acquired control of PAT on 1 January 1928. This immediately provided a market for new aircraft as six four- passenger Boeing 40Bs were supplied to the airline during 1928. On 17 December 1928, PAT merged into Boeing Air Transport, but continued to operate as a separate division, retaining its own identity.

Career The West Country goalkeeper began his career playing for Coleford Athletic under 13s, he then moved into Non-League football with Paulton Rovers and then earned a big move to Bristol City where he went on to play 250 league appearances for the Ashton Gate outfit. However, after an alleged falling out with City boss Gary Johnson he was replaced from the first team by Adriano Basso early into the 2005‚Äì06 season. Despite being in his testimonial season Phillips never figured regularly again for City. In the summer of 2006, Phillips moved across the city to bitter rivals Bristol Rovers F.C. This was after Phillips made a \\"come and get me\\" plea to Swindon Town manager Dennis Wise through ex-City teammate Lee Peacock. Wise chose to pursue Petr Brezovan instead. Phillips took over the number one jersey at Bristol Rovers, taking over from Scott Shearer and helped Rovers secure a play-off spot in the 2006/07 season with Phillips earning praise, and winning Player of the Year. Phillips won League Two's player of the month for November after not conceding any league goals during that month. He also won the Football League's Golden Glove competition after keeping the most clean sheets for the 2006‚Äì07 season. Steve was in Turkey hoping to sign a contract with Turkish Super League Division Three team Ankara Demirspor. There was also interest from Turkish side Ankarag√ºc√º who already have English influences with former Manchester City striker Darius Vassell and former Luton Town winger Ian Henderson on their books. However, a contract was rejected from both teams, and he has returned to Rovers. On 26 August 2009, Phillips signed for Shrewsbury Town on a one-month loan deal, which was soon extended. In November 2009, he joined League 2 side Crewe on a two-month loan with a view to make the move permanent. Phillips made his Crewe Alexandra debut against Morecambe in a 2‚Äì1 home loss. On 6 January 2010, Phillips extended his loan with Crewe until the end of the season. He established himself as number one, but missed the last three games of the season through a shoulder injury. Along with 14 other players, he was released by Rovers at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, and, after his successful loan period, he was signed by Crewe. He quickly established himself in the Alex team and was part of the 2011‚Äì12 side promoted to League One. In an effort to keep hold of his first choice goalkeeper, Crewe manager Steve Davis offered Phillips a player/coach role in 2012. After losing his first team place to youngster Ben Garratt, Phillips left the club at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season to take up a coaching role with Shepton Mallet. He will also play non-league football with local club Nantwich Town. In June 2015, he joined Bath City. In 2016, he joined Mangotsfield United In September 2017, Phillips joined League Two side Yeovil Town as interim goalkeeping coach following the departure of Sam Shulberg.

'lightning') is a combat engineering vehicle produced by Serbia. VTI has done the conceptual design of the Munja general-purpose engineer vehicle and the ƒåaƒçak-based Overhaul Depot has built the vehicle. The main idea was converting the T-55 tank, using its main structure and subsystems and adding new components, equipment and devices to create a vehicle for entirely different purposes. Good terrain negotiating ability and ballistic protection of T-55 tank were retained, while engineer equipment and armament were refitted. It is the first armoured vehicle for the engineer corps outfitted with special purpose engineer equipment and respectable armament, belonging to the most modern designs of this kind.  Overview  It is designed to negotiate natural and man-made obstacles, blocking, fortifying and repair of roads and for safe transport of engineer teams and equipment in combat conditions. VTI designers have thoughtfully arranged accommodation for 8 members of the crew (2 permanent members ‚Äì driver and deputy commander, also gunner of the 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and 7.62 mm machine gun, and a 6-member troop ‚Äì commander and section of five pioneers). Space is also provided for sets of engineer equipment, for mounting of commander's and gunner's cupola and associated equipment. Space needed to accommodate personnel and sets of special equipment was obtained by removing tank turret, cutting away section of hull roof plate and by refitting of superstructure consisting of armour plates and sheet metal that provides adequate ballistic protection of on-board crew and equipment. Armour plates are up to 25 mm thick and mounted so as to provide ballistic protection from 12.7 mm (.5in) bullets. Horizontal roof plate of superstructure is made of several sections to provide necessary hatches. Openings are provided for fitting of commander's and gunner's cupolas, two access and evacuation hatches for engineer section, holes for radio set antenna, rotating periscope, driver's cover, refueling port and two lookout ports (for observation and for firing personal weapons). To perform engineering tasks, a tankgrade blade it fitted at the front, equipped with electric motor, pump and hydraulics. Blade assembly is an autonomous unit that can be quickly and easily attached to the hull.  Armament  Vehicle firepower consists of one 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and one machine gun (M84, .3in/7.62 mm calibre). Vehicle concept permits fitting of weapons group station consisting of a 30 mm gun, 7.62 mm machine gun, antitank wire guided rockets and 30 mm automatic grenade launcher with appropriate optoelectronic fire control system. To protect the crew from nuclear and chemical agents a modified nuclear-chemical protection unit is built-in, consisting of anti radiation fan. This is automatically activated in case of nuclear shock wave. Protection from shaped charges consists of very effective skirts.  Protection  For masking protection, Munja was designed for protection in all ranges of electromagnetic spectrum (visual, close IR, radar and thermal parts of the spectrum). For masking and jamming of guided projectiles, the vehicle is equipped with smoke canisters' launcher and control panel identical to those mounted on M-84 tanks. Smoke charge launchers are mounted in front section of tracks covering plates. Munja integrates all equipment needed for specific engineering combat missions (crossing of artificial obstacles, making of barriers, road making and fortifying). Owing to modern positioning system, Munja can be tracked on virtual map while newly developed software enables the use of advanced computer technologies in the execution of engineering works. In parallel with development of Munja, engineer units were supplied with combat sets of specialist pioneer equipment which also ranks among the best in that category. To prevent fuel explosions and resulting fires in the event of penetration of ballistic protection, a fuel explosion and fire prevention system has been fitted. It is autonomous, provided with UV and IR sensors with detection and activation time measured as thousands of a second.  Mobility  Mobility of Munja engineer vehicle is at the level of T-55 tank but it could be further improved by retrofit of higher power engine and modern transmission, in particular of the MPG-780 modular power pack featuring the engine developing 580 kW (780 HP). Power pack is replaceable in field conditions.  Operational capabilities  General purpose engineer vehicle Munja can be well used in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The existing model represents the base for development of a family of tracked armoured combat vehicles; in particular of armoured personnel carrier possessing considerably higher level of all-round ballistic protection compared to current conventional APC-s and IFV-s.

Keys formed North American Aviation in early 1925, for the express purpose of providing organization, finance and inspiration for the development of a large network of airlines, manufacturers and other aviation services, each nurturing the other. Keys contacted Carl B., Fritsche, general manager of the Aircraft Development Corporation of Detroit, with the idea of creating an airline to link Chicago with Detroit and New York City. Davies, 1998, p. 51 To insure a sound base for operations, Keys proposed an initial subscribed share capital of $2 million, many times that of other early airlines. Keys raised $1 million through his New York contacts and Fritsche raised $500,000 from Detroit interests. After further fund raising, the remaining $500,000 was subscribed by the sons of several leading Chicago business men. This enabled National Air Transport Inc. (NAT) to be incorporated in the state of Delaware on 21 May 1925. The total authorized issued share capital was fixed at an unprecedented $10 million. Davies, 1998, p. 51-52 Airmail contract bid and commencement of operations Keys and other members of NAT's board realized that an airmail contract would be crucial to the development of the airline, and NAT bid for mail contract CAM 3 from the United States Post Office. This covered the Chicago‚ÄìDallas route and was awarded to NAT on 7 November 1925. This was a key link in the US airmail network, connecting two important cities and regions with the transcontinental route through Chicago. Davies, 1998, p. 52 Ten Carrier Pigeon biplane aircraft were built by Curtiss, one of Key's other business interests. These were used to open the NAT airmail service on 12 May 1926 on a route Chicago- Moline-St Joseph-Kansas City-Wichita-Ponca City-Oklahoma City-Dallas. Davies, 1998, p.52 On 7 May 1930 N.A.T. was acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, a holding company that already owned several airlines that operated as independent divisions. On 12 September 1930 N.A.T. itself purchased one of these divisions, Stout Air Services, Inc. Stout had purchased Ford Air Transport Service's airmail routes in 1928, and flew Ford Trimotors. New York-Chicago mail route NAT wished to expand their network and bid for the New York-Chicago airmail route CAM 17. On 2 April 1927 the airline was awarded the contract in competition with three other bidders; the rate was to be $1.24 per pound of airmail carried. 14 pilots were taken on from the Post Office Department and the service over the Allegheny Mountains began 1 September, initially with Curtiss Carrier Pigeons, quickly supplemented by 18 Douglas M-2s taken over from the Post Office. In early 1928 NAT added eight Travel Air 6000s. Davies, 1998, p. 61 NAT passenger flights between New York (Newark) and Chicago began in December 1930, one Ford Trimotor a day each way. Until then NAT had carried occasional passengers on the mail flights to Hadley Field for a $200 one-way fare.NY Times 25 Sept 1927 p3, 24 June 1928 section 9 p17, 18 Nov 1930 p27 One-way fare Newark to Chicago in 1931 was $59.50.

Blind Veterans UK, formerly St Dunstan's, is a large British charity, providing free support and services to vision-impaired ex- Armed Forces and National Service personnel. Blind Veterans UK is a registered charity in England and Scotland and operates throughout the United Kingdom. It has its head office in London and centres in Brighton, Sheffield and in Llandudno, Wales. Description Established in 1915, Blind Veterans UK provides free services and lifelong support to ex-Service men and women with visual impairments. Its specialist services promote and enable these veterans to regain their independence, meet new challenges and achieve a better quality of life. Blind Veterans UK supports anyone who has served in the British Armed Forces and is experiencing sight loss (be that due to age, accident or illness), and the charity's duty of care extends to all beneficiaries and their families for life. Blind Veterans UK has pioneered many advances in care for the blind and partially sighted; for example, it co-developed the first talking books with the RNIB. History Blind Veterans UK was founded by Arthur Pearson, who had himself lost his sight due to glaucoma. Because of the increasing numbers of British soldiers returning from the front lines during the First World War suffering from blindness (especially from mustard gas attacks), Pearson established a hostel for these soldiers as well as blinded sailors and airmen. His intention was that, with training and assistance, they could go on to lead productive lives and would not have to depend on charity. The Blinded Soldiers and Sailors Hostel's first location was in Bayswater Hill, London. Shortly after, the organisation moved to St Dunstan's Lodge in Regent's Park (the site of Winfield House), along with its first 16 members. The Committee's work was praised by the London press at the time ‚Äì a reference to the Lodge appeared in The Illustrated London News in 1915, which said: \\"in a corner of London's most beautiful park is a house where miracles are worked.\\" American opera singer Pauline Donnan worked with the newly blind soldiers there, teaching vocal techniques and assisting some in finding singing or teaching jobs.\\"American Singer Develops Talent of Blinded Soldiers\\" Musical Courier (October 17, 1918): 43. On Pearson's death in 1921, the chairmanship fell to Ian Fraser, who had been placed in charge of the charity's after-care activities by Pearson, providing assistance and social events such as reunion meetings for the blinded veterans after they had left the hostel in Regent's Park. Fraser had served during the First World War in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry and was blinded by a bullet on the Somme. Having become generally known by the name of the building in which it was based, the organisation then formally changed its name to St Dunstan's in 1923. Fraser remained as chairman until his death in 1974. St Dunstan's opened its flagship training, convalescent, care and holiday centre in Ovingdean, Brighton, in 1938. The Brighton centre was one of the first buildings in Britain purpose-built for those with a disability and every aspect of its construction was specially designed for blind and partially sighted visitors and residents. Shortly after its opening, The Architect and Building News praised the centre's \\"magnificent views over the Downs and out to sea\\", as well as the thought that had gone into making the building ideal for the blind. The centre's residents included World War I veteran Henry Allingham, born 1896, who was briefly the oldest man in the world until his death in 2009. During the Second World War, the charity admitted those who had lost their sight through their work in the auxiliary services, women's services and munitions factories, besides service personnel from Poland, Netherlands, United States, Canada and South Africa. Due to concerns about potential air raids on Brighton during the Blitz, the charity evacuated its operation from Brighton to the town of Church Stretton, Shropshire, where it occupied the Long Mynd HotelReport by Thomas Morton on unveiling of commemorative plaque. and other buildings, setting up an industrial training centre and a hospital. By 1946, the year it returned to Brighton, the charity cared for over 2,000 blind ex-Service personnel. The charity's centre at Brighton was used as an eye hospital during the war. The charity moved to its current central London headquarters in Harcourt Street, Marylebone, in 1984. In 2000 the charity changed its constitution to allow veterans to join regardless of whether their sight loss was directly related to their service. In 2012, the charity formally became Blind Veterans UK, to help ensure the organisation and its work was \\"better recognised and understood\\".Blind Veterans UK St Dunstan's is now Blind Veterans UK Activities Victory Over Blindness sculpture outside Manchester Piccadilly station to commemorate the centenary of World War I and partly funded by Blind Veterans UK Blind Veterans UK works to provide vision- impaired Armed Forces and National Service veterans with the services and tailored support they need to lead independent lives after sight loss. The charity's work ranges from helping veterans relearn vital life skills and providing them with the tools they need to be independent in their own homes, to offering new learning, training and recreation opportunities and providing long-term nursing, residential and respite care. It continues to assist veterans blinded in service, including men and women recently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2012, Blind Veterans UK launched its No One Alone campaign to find people who are unaware that they may be eligible for its assistance. Research from the charity estimated that there could be up to 68,000 ex- Service men and women in the UK who are eligible for its support. Blind Veterans UK runs a wide variety of activities from its centres in Brighton, Sheffield and Llandudno, including photography, gardening and arts and crafts. Blind Veterans UK has a long-running writing competition, with those supported by the charity submitting their own original stories. The competition has had celebrity judges in the past, including Doctor Who star Jon Pertwee. The charity also has a sporting reputation, organising blind sports like goalball as well as conventional sports such as shooting, archery and rock-climbing. Two representatives of Blind Veterans UK, Tony Parkinson and Ray Peart, participated in the 1976 Toronto Paralympics. Some Blind Veterans UK representatives have participated in extreme sports, including Billy Baxter, who holds the world record for fastest blind motorcyclist. Blind Veterans UK runs Project Gemini in partnership with the Blinded Veterans Association, a similar organisation for American veterans. Since forming the partnership in 2011, both organisations have visited each other's centres.

Founded in 1849, Ducommun is recognized as the oldest business in Californiahttps://www.visualcapitalist.com/oldest-business-state/ and today manufactures structural and electronic components and sub-assemblies for a wide range of commercial, military and space platforms including the Boeing 737 NG and 777 airliners, the C-17 heavy lift cargo jet, the Apache, Chinook and Black Hawk helicopters, the Space Shuttle, International Space Station and Mars Rover. For decades, Ducommun has designed and manufactured complex electronic systems and sub-assemblies for advanced missile programs and platforms, and provided engineering and program management services to the United States Military, the United States Department of Homeland Security, NASA and other government agencies. Ducommun's approximately 2,700 employees work at its 17 manufacturing centers located in California, Arkansas, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, New York, Wisconsin, Thailand and Mexico. Its corporate headquarters is based in Santa Ana, California.  History  A.C. Martin & Associates, built in 1941. Ducommun was established in 1849 by Charles Louis Ducommun, a watchmaker by training, who emigrated to the United States from Switzerland in the early 1840s. The Company started as a general store, providing supplies and credit to gold prospectors and other pioneers who had settled in the burgeoning pueblo of Los Angeles. At the time, California was still a territory of the United States, just on the verge of statehood with the population of Los Angeles then standing at just about 1,600. The store had a public \\"circulating library\\", lending books if paid in full with a full refund upon return. In 1857 Charles Louis Ducommun married Bertha Rontex, of San Francisco, and they had a baby girl the next year. In 1873 he was an officer of the Royal Arch Masons, Los Angeles Chapter No. 33. They built a \\"mansion\\" at 527 Lazard Street, east of Alameda Street, south of Aliso Street, and about 1875 their street was renamed \\"Ducommun Street\\". In 1892 their vacant \\"mansion\\" was donated and converted into the \\"News' and Working Boys' Home\\", a woman-run charity, formerly on First Street, which charged $1.50 per week for room, board, and laundry. In 1900, the Boy's Home moved to San Pedro Street and the mansion was donated to the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles repurposed as a \\"men's boarding house\\", called the \\"Bethlehem Hotel\\" from the Bethlehem Institutes (nearby, corner of Vignes and Ducommun Streets) under the supervision of the Rev. Dr, Dana W. Bartlett. In 1902 a new Bethlehem Men's Hotel was built on Vignes Street, and this mansion became a \\"Japanese lodging house.\\" In the 1890s he was a stockholder and member of the board of directors of Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles, of which Isaias W. Hellman was president. Ducommun kept pace with the growth of the southern California economy, and in 1907 incorporated as The Ducommun Hardware Company, evolving into a value added-distributor of metals provided by the Eastern mills. This coincided with the emergence of a defense-based industry, e.g., munitions and shipbuilding, as the country entered World War I, and during the 1920s the arrival of general aviation. Charles Albert Ducommun, one of Charles Louis Ducommun's four sons, decided early on to support an innovative aircraft designer named Donald Douglas, marking the beginning of the Company's longstanding partnership with what was to become the aerospace industry. Symbolic of this new relationship, Ducommun tubular steel flew in 1927 on the Ryan-designed Spirit of St. Louis during Charles Lindbergh's historic transatlantic flight from Long Island's Roosevelt Field to Paris. Ducommun became a more prominent distributor during World War II, inventorying large quantities of stainless steel, carbon steel, and alloys, mostly to support the production of bomber and fighter aircraft that were used in both the European and Pacific theaters. Following the war, the Company joined its customers in the aircraft industry's transition to making long-distance passenger aircraft such as the Lockheed Constellation and, just as importantly, their commitment to the Space Age. Under the leadership of Charles Emil Ducommun (the grandson of Charles Louis Ducommun, and son of Charles Albert), the Company went public in 1949 having become the leading metal materials distributor in the West, and Alcoa's largest distributor nationwide. Over the next 15 years, Ducommun diversified to support the needs of an aircraft industry that was rapidly incorporating more electronic components. With the acquisition of Kierulff Electronics in the early 1960s and the distribution business of Texas Instruments in 1981, Ducommun became a national force in the distribution of electronic components and subsystems. Charles Ducommun retired as the company's chairman in 1978. The 1980s were years of restructuring and change. Both the metals and electronics distribution businesses were sold as the Company retrenched having suffered punishing losses, coming very close to bankruptcy by 1987. It had reoriented itself to become a member of the aerospace industry supply chain with the acquisition of four small companies that fabricated metal parts, and that in one case manufactured switches for aircraft cockpit instrument panels. In 1987 Norman Barkeley, a seasoned aerospace executive and recently retired chief executive officer of Lear Siegler, joined the Ducommun board of directors, and the following year became the company's chairman. Barkeley's leadership restored the company's growth and profitability, and with five targeted acquisitions established the footing for the progress of the next decade. He retired as Chairman Emeritus in 1998, and was succeeded by Joe Berenato who had been the company's chief financial Officer for six years before becoming its president and chief operating officer. Berenato built upon the stable platform established by Barkeley, both through acquisition and the investment in process capability, which, in turn, have helped the company win important new programs. The enablement provided by the acquisition of Composite Structures, Miltec, WiseWave, CMP, and most recently DynaBil Industries, and the companywide application of Lean and Six Sigma to manufacturing, engineering, and administrative processes has resulted in the profitable doubling of revenues since the year 2000.  Faulty parts dispute with Boeing  In 2000, Boeing convened an internal audit team to investigate quality control and regulatory compliance problems with parts manufactured by Ducommun. The parts in question were manufactured in the company's Gardena, California factory, and were installed on as many as 300 Boeing 737 NG aircraft built from 1994. In the audit, Boeing alleged that Ducommun's factories failed to produce parts using the specified processes and tolerances, and recommended that the relationship with Ducommun be re- evaluated. The audit committee also recommended that Boeing should seek financial recourse. Although the company stated that no such payment was made, Ducommun did ultimately agree to repay $1.6 million to Boeing as compensation for manufacturing problems and overbilling. A 2010 documentary by Al Jazeera alleged that in three plane crashes involving 737 NGs ‚Äì Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, American Airlines Flight 331 and AIRES Flight 8250 ‚Äì the aircraft's fuselage broke up following impact with the ground because of defective structural components supplied by Ducommun. However, the accident investigations in all three cases did not highlight any link between post- impact structural failures and manufacturing issues.

He is most remembered for his coverage of the American space program. A native of New York City, Bergman was educated at the City College of New York and Indiana University. While doing postgraduate work at Columbia University, Bergman held a Sloan-Rockefeller Advanced Science Writing Fellowship, which he completed in 1960. ABC News Bergman began his journalism career in 1949 at Time magazine. He briefly worked at CBS News, then joined the news staff of WFDR-FM in New York, eventually becoming the station's assistant news director. Bergman joined ABC News as a writer in 1953, specializing in science issues. In the late 1950s he began covering the activities of the Space Task Group. Bergman was named Science Editor in 1961, the same year that the first manned Vostok and Mercury flights took place. Though he became most famous for his work on covering space missions, Bergman covered stories in a range of areas, including aviation, defense matters, medicine, health, astronomy and public safety. He was pressed into service as a general assignment reporter on some special occasions. For example, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Bergman was sent to New York's Times Square to report on citizens' reactions to the President's death. The space program Bergman began covering developments in space exploration during the 1950s. He went on to cover the entirety of the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab and Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz programs for ABC.Lovell, James, and Jeffrey Kluger. Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13. New York: Houghton Mifflin; 1994. 4. Also Burrows, William E. This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age. New York: Random House; 1999. 448‚Äì449. Bergman's reporting for ABC was noted for its direct style. In contrast to the more avuncular style of CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, Bergman's reporting took a very serious tone, and was very direct (to the point of seeming pessimistic at times) about the possible consequences of any mishaps or accidents that took place during a spaceflight, such as the Apollo 13 accident.Lovell and Kluger, 273.Gase, Thomas, \\"Local NASA ambassadors reflect on Apollo 13‚Äôs 50th anniversary\\", Vallejo Times Herald, April 17, 2020. Quote: \\"As early as April 13, [the day of the explosion on board,] ... Bergman was saying on the air that the crew had a 10 percent chance to live.\\" Retrieved 2020-06-16. In order to more fully understand the astronauts and their missions, Bergman often took part in the same training and simulations that the astronauts did.Barron, 1987; Lovell and Kluger, 4. Bergman later covered the missions of NASA's unmanned space probes, notably the Viking and Voyager programs. He also covered the Space Shuttle program from its first flights through the 1986 Challenger disaster.Barron, 1987. =\\"Phillips report\\"= After the Apollo 1 fire took the lives of astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger B. Chaffee on January 27, 1967, Bergman discovered and revealed the existence of a NASA document that became known as the Phillips Report, which led to a minor scandal complicating NASA's recovery from the fire, and causing administrator James E. Webb much embarrassment. In November 1965, Apollo program director Samuel C. Phillips had led a team that investigated and documented the causes of delivery, quality, and cost problems with Apollo prime contractor North American Aviation. Phillips and his boss George Mueller had both severely chastised North American's management for the problems and demanded corrective action. Immediately after the fire in 1967, NASA followed its established investigation protocol to identify the cause and recommend changes to prevent a recurrence, all under presidential and congressional oversight. No one in NASA's upper management expected that the Phillips findings would be printed as a document, but on February 13, Bergman was shown a copy at the Office of Manned Space Flight headquarters. He then told a junior Senator on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, Walter Mondale, about the document, and later reported its existence on ABC. Mondale proceeded to grill the top managers, including Webb, who was completely blind-sided, about the report's existence. Other senators, such as Margaret Chase Smith, then questioned Webb about NASA's choice of North American as the Apollo contractor. In its final report, the committee agreed with NASA that the Phillips review had absolutely no bearing on the fire, though the chairman expressed his disappointment that Webb had not kept them informed of Apollo program problems at the time. But Mondale issued a minority opinion accusing NASA of \\"evasiveness, ... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\\". Note: Apollo 1 was initially designated AS-204. Other science reporting Though best known for his reporting on space issues, Bergman also filed many reports on medical issues for ABC. He reported on such issues as organ transplantation, arthritis, communicable diseases, the hazards of asbestos, and advances in the treatment of cancer. Bergman wrote Ninety Seconds to Space: The Story of the X-15 (1960). He was particularly well known for his reportage on aviation and defense matters. Bergman began training for his private pilot certificate in 1958, and turned the story of his flight training into an instructional book, Anyone Can Fly (1964; revised 1977).Bergman, Jules. Anyone Can Fly. New York: Doubleday and Co., 1964. Bergman also reported on major aviation developments and disasters for ABC, and covered the development of new weapons systems for the military of the United States. Bergman covered energy issues, including the oil crisis of the 1970s. He was a major contributor to ABC's coverage of the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station. Bergman also was a contributor to ABC's Close-Up series of documentaries. He won an Emmy Award for his work on the half-hour documentary Close-Up: On Fire. Bergman occasionally sat in as a guest host on the ABC public affairs series Issues and Answers, and contributed to other ABC programs, including Good Morning America. In cooperation with ABC's Wide World of Sports, Bergman covered Evel Knievel's 1974 attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon. Final years Bergman was diagnosed with a nonmalignant brain tumor and underwent surgery in the late 1970s. In the years following, he underwent additional surgeries to remove additional growths, and took anti-seizure medications. Bergman was found dead in his New York apartment on February 11, 1987. A memorial service was held four days later in New York City, at which Bergman was eulogized by NASA astronaut Joseph P. Allen. Surviving are his wife, Joanna; two brothers, Cyril, of Fitchburg, Mass., and Philip, of Wayne, N.J., and three children by a previous marriage to Joanne Skowron of Nyack, N.Y., David, of Manhattan, Beth, of Palo Alto, Calif., and Karen, of Manhattan. Memorials and pop culture The National Association of Physician Broadcasters named its award for excellence in reporting after Jules Bergman. The award was named for Bergman until 1999. Many television documentaries have featured clips from Bergman's reporting on the American space program. Footage of Bergman's reports also figured prominently in the 1995 motion picture Apollo 13 and the 2016 American biographical drama film Hidden Figures. Bergman portrayed himself in a 1974 episode of The Six Million Dollar Man titled \\"The Rescue of Athena One.\\" Bergman was portrayed by Andrew Rubin in an episode of the 1998 HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon, titled \\"For Miles and Miles\\". He also appeared in clips and commentary in the first part of the three-part Chasing the Moon PBS documentary.\\"Chasing the Moon - Part One (transcript)\\",pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience, July 10, 2019 (original air date).

Born in Kelloe, Seymour is one of the all-time Newcastle United greats, and was known as 'Mr. Newcastle United' after the various years and roles he delivered for the club. As a player, despite his small physique, he was famous for tearing defences from the left wing.  Early career  After originally being rejected by Newcastle United as a teenager; the local pit worker was told to 'come back when you grow up', he played some non-league football for Shildon Athletic and Coxhoe before joining Bradford City in 1911 for a short spell, making only one competitive appearance. He then joined Scottish side Greenock Morton. He developed as a player at Morton, becoming popular with the locals who called him 'The little Englishman'. Unlike England, a fairly normal league season was played throughout the First World War in Scotland, and in all of Seymour's time in Greenock, Morton never finished outside the top four of what was a highly competitive league (the moment he had gone they slipped dramatically down the table). His performances were noticed back in England and he was eventually offered a transfer to the club who originally rejected him, Newcastle United in 1920 for a fee of ¬£2,500.  Newcastle United  It did not take long for Seymour to become a crowd favourite at St. James' Park, his performances helped Newcastle reach the FA Cup Final with goals against Portsmouth, Derby County, Liverpool, and Manchester City before eventually going on to win the FA Cup in 1924 in a 2‚Äì0 win over Aston Villa, in which he scored a thunderous 20-yard half volley to secure the win. He was also part of the Newcastle team that were crowned Division One champions in 1926‚Äì27. Such displays also earned him a call-up to the England squad in a tour to Australia. However, in 1929, he was to leave the club after a disagreement with the officials over wages and a testimonial match. This was to be the end of his playing days as he decided to turn down the chance to join North-east rivals Middlesbrough and set up a sports shop in Newcastle upon Tyne, as he vowed 'never to kick a ball again'. He also later became involved in journalism. However his good service for Newcastle United were not forgotten and he was appointed the club's new Director in 1938. As director he had control of first-team affairs, but like Frank Watt could not pick the team under the Director's Committee. However he had more influence on who could play than Watt had during his time at the club, and in fact did not believe that one man should have sole responsibility for picking the team. He was manager of the club with the Directors Committee from 1938 to 1954, aside from a period from 1947 to 1950 when George Martin took over the role. In 1943, Seymour gave a trial to a 19-year-old 'Wor Jackie' Milburn, who later became a club legend himself. The club won the FA Cup in 1951 and retained it in 1952 whilst Seymour was at the helm. Seymour became the first person in English football history to win the FA Cup with the same club as a player and manager. In December 1954, Seymour stepped down from the manager's role and became the club's vice-chairman, appointing Doug Livingstone as the new manager. However, Seymour still believed that the manager's responsibilities should extend no further than training and motivating the players, something he demonstrated when Livingstone attempted to drop Jackie Milburn from the team for the 1955 FA Cup Final. Seymour responded to this by immediately relieving Livingstone of his ability to select the team, picking the eventual final team largely by himself, and saw Newcastle's victory in the final as vindication of his approach. By the end of the year Livingstone had been completely barred from working with the first team in any capacity, and his resignation near the start of 1956 allowed Seymour to fully take over the manager's role again. Newcastle's overall form deteriorated rapidly after this, though, and when the club only avoided relegation on goal average in 1958 it paved the way for chairman William McKeag (a bitter rival of Seymour's) to appoint Charlie Mitten as the new manager. Still, Seymour remained as part of the board until his death in 1978, and was appointed Life President of the club in 1976. In a 2009 article written in The Times Online, Seymour was named Newcastle United's 5th Greatest player of all time. He scored 73 goals in 242 games for the club. His son Stan Seymour, Jr. later became chairman of Newcastle United.  Legacy  'Wor Jackie' Milburn was once quoted saying \\"There is a great debt owed by Newcastle United to Stan Seymour for all of his services to the club\\". Former United player and manager Kevin Keegan promised during his first spell incharge to rename the club's Youth Academy after Seymour, however this was not carried out due to Keegan's resignation. The North Eastern League Cup (in which teams from the Northern Football Alliance Premier Division compete in) was renamed the Stan Seymour League Cup in his honour.

Michael T. \\"Nuf Ced\\" McGreevy (June 16, 1865 ‚Äì February 2, 1943) was the leader of the most vocal fans of the Boston Americans (now the Boston Red Sox), known as the \\"Royal Rooters\\", and owner of a Boston bar called the Third Base Saloon. Biography McGreevy's bar got its name because, like third base, it was the last stop before home. His saloon was Boston's original sports bar‚Äîit was decorated in a baseball theme, with pictures of the players, and a scoreboard on the outside wall. His nickname, \\"Nuf Ced\\", was given to him because that was what he usually shouted to end barroom disputes, usually about the Boston Americans and the Boston Braves. He was an avid member of the L Street Brownies, one of the oldest polar bear swim clubs in the country. McGreevy amassed a rich collection of photographs, clippings, and other baseball memorabilia. When Prohibition forced McGreevy to close Third Base, he donated his collection to the Boston Public Library. Author Glenn Stout (A Red Sox Century) helped popularize the collection when he worked at the library. The theme song of the Royal Rooters was \\"Tessie\\" from the Broadway musical \\"The Silver Slipper\\". McGreevy was mentioned in a 2004 remake of the song by the Irish American punk band Dropkick Murphys‚ÄîTessie, Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted, We're not here to mess around. The song was subsequently part of the soundtrack of the 2005 movie Fever Pitch concerning fans of the 2004 Boston Red Sox season. In 2008, Dropkick Murphys bassist Ken Casey re-opened Third Base, although it is no longer known as such. Now the tavern is known as McGreevy's, and can be converted to open-air.

The parish includes the hamlet of Rofford and the former parish of Warpsgrove with which it merged in 1932. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,830. Chalgrove is the site of a small Civil War battle in 1643, the Battle of Chalgrove Field. The Parliamentarian John Hampden was wounded in the battle, and died of his wounds six days later. Archaeology A very rare silver Roman coin (circa AD 271) was found at Chalgrove: a base silver Roman coin called a radiate of Emperor Domitian II. This was the first such coin found in Britain. The only other was found in France and was thought to be a forgery until the discovery of the British coin proved the existence of the short-lived emperor. In the 1976 drought, aerial archaeology found cropmarks of filled-in moats and earthworks beside Back Brook. Subsequent archaeological excavation at this location revealed the remains of a 13th- century moated manor house. Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Celgrave. Later spellings include Chealgraue in 1170 and Chalcgrava in 1236. It is derived from the Old English cealc-gr√¶f or cealc-grafu, meaning \\"chalk or limestone pit\\". The manor house is early 15th-century, making it the second-oldest building in Chalgrove. It stands partly on the site of an earlier building, originally the de Plessis manor and manorial court-house. The great hall has a medieval oak screen on the ground floor, possibly from the 13th-century house, late 16th century painted grey studding on the first floor and was horizontally subdivided in the 16th century. The hall has also a finely-detailed arch-braced collar roof with double purlins with seating for a smoke louvre. The carpentry in the roof is of exceptional quality and it may be that the carpenters were the same as those who built the Royal Palace at nearby Ewelme around the same time. The north wing has a medieval annexe and garderobe chute outlet. The rear extensions are early 16th century. The south wing parlour has 17th-century painted grained panels. The house was repaired and restored in the 1980s. It is a Grade I listed building. Parish church 17th-century baptismal font in St Mary's parish church The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin date from the 13th century. It was begun by monks from the Abbey of Bec, an important Benedictine abbey in Normandy. There is a canonical sundial on the south wall. The interior comprises a wide nave with two aisles separated by transitional Norman arcades with carved capitals and a chancel. The church is thought to remain substantially as it was in 1500, although some records state that there was a spire on top of the tower until violent storm in 1727 blew it down. Jennifer Sherwood confirms this and suggests that the \\"tower was probably remodelled during repairs\\" at that time. In the 14th century the chancel was decorated with a series of wall paintings showing a Tree of Jesse, the Last Judgement and the medieval legend of the Assumption of Mary. Historians believe these wall-paintings were completed around 1320 possibly at the request of the de Barantyn family, who lived in one of the two manors in Chalgrove at the time. Sherwood describe the paintings as \\"one of the most complete series in the country\\" and suggest that they date from the mid 14th century. The paintings were limewashed over at the time of the English Reformation and rediscovered in 1858 during renovation work commissioned by the then Vicar, Rev. Robert French Laurence. Some of the paintings on the north wall are a little indistinct now due to their age and two of the paintings on the south wall were covered or damaged by marble monuments while the paintings lay hidden under the lime wash. Painted monument in St Mary's parish church to Robert Quatremaine (died 1697) As well as medieval wall paintings and later stone monuments, St Mary's has a highly unusual painted monument dating from the end of the 17th century. It was painted in or shortly after 1697 on the east wall of St James' chapel, which is in the north aisle of St Mary's. In 1984 it was expertly removed for restoration and repositioned at the east end of the nave. Its removal revealed a hitherto unknown medieval wall painting in St James' chapel, which is earlier than those in the chancel. The west tower has a ring of six bells and there is also a sanctus bell. Henry II Knight of Reading cast the sanctus bell in 1659 and the second, third and fourth bells in 1664. Abraham II Rudhall of Gloucester cast the fifth and tenor bells in 1729. Henry I Bond and Sons of Burford cast the treble bell in 1888. The tower has also a single-handed turret clock, part of which was made about 1699. St Mary's is a Grade I listed building. St Mary's parish has long been linked with that of St Helen's Berrick Salome. In The Departed Village, Moreau writes \\"so far as records go back it [St Helen's] has never officially been more than a chapelry of Chalgrove and since the Conquest the indications are that it has never had a priest not shared with that parish. Such an arrangement is the more surprising because Berrick and Chalgrove have had no common boundary for the last thousand years\\", being separated by Berrick Prior (a part of Newington parish). \\"Moreover, while the incumbent has been only vicar of Chalgrove,\\" \\"he is rector of Berrick.\\" Economic and social history Chalgrove originated as a linear village surrounded by open fields occupying a site on the banks of the stream. Early houses were built along the sides of the original road to Oxford. 1 and 2 The Green: two 17th- and 18th- century thatched cottages In 1086 the Domesday Book counted five mills operating on Chalgrove Brook. Today there is only one mill, at the western end of the village on the appropriately-named 'Mill Lane' opposite The Manor. The mill was restored to working condition in 1998 ‚Äî including turning the overshot water wheel around to become a high-breast one ‚Äî and was used to grind corn on an open day in 1999. After Chalgrove, the Brook flows through Stadhampton and then Chiselhampton where it joins the River Thame, a tributary of the River Thames. Flooding used to be a problem, with 22 houses seriously flooded in 1879. In the 19th century a sluice was built at the eastern end of the village and from the original Chalgrove Stream, now called the Back Brook, some of the water was diverted to run alongside the current High Street. The artificial loop, called the Front Brook, has become a popular feature. The brook's flow is now much reduced and the risk of flooding has declined. Only a small part of the High Street is now deemed to be at occasional risk. scabious flowering on his grave Rev. RF Laurence (1807‚Äì85), who was vicar of Chalgrove and Berrick Salome for the last 53 years of his life founded the parish's school and taught there himself. Laurence was also secretary of the local agricultural workers' trades union. He was a social reformer who campaigned for better housing for agricultural workers and had new thatched cottages built for them in the parish. He is buried at Chalgrove in St Mary's parish churchyard, just south of the chancel. After a long period of stability, the village's population grew very rapidly from fewer than 1,000 residents in 1961 to just over 3,000 by 1996, mainly due to a new housing estate being developed in the area called Sixpenny Fields between the village core and the more recent bypass, the B480 road. The road into this development is named French Laurence Way after Rev. Laurence. Parts of Chalgrove, and its airfield, featured in the episode Many Happy Returns of the Granada Television series The Prisoner. RAF Chalgrove RAF Chalgrove from the air in 1944 In the Second World War the government needed level ground for airfields. The standard three-runway Chalgrove Airfield was built in 1943, and in February 1944 the United States Army Air Forces moved in with a photo-reconnaissance squadron of Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft. Three more squadrons joined in March to bring the station to full strength. These squadrons performed many low-level operations over France to provide valuable information prior to, and shortly after, the Normandy landings in June 1944. In March 1945 the USAAF PR squadrons from nearby RAF Mount Farm moved to Chalgrove with their P-51 Mustang and P-38 Lightning aircraft. Reconnaissance work continued over peacetime Europe in order to assess damage. The USAAF left at the end of 1945. After the airfield reverted to the RAF and became a satellite of RAF Benson, until an agreement was reached with the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company to use the airfield to test ejection seats. The first live ejection from a Martin- Baker seat, fitted to a Gloster Meteor, was made over Chalgrove airfield in July 1946. Martin-Baker still uses the airfield. It is mostly used for ejection seat testing and very few aircraft now use the airfield.Martin-Baker In 2016 the Ministry of Defence transferred ownership of the airfield site to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), which in 2018 was succeeded by Homes England. Chalgrove Band Members of Chalgrove Band in 2011 Chalgrove BandChalgrove Band is an amateur brass band, which was formed toward the end of the 19th century, initially as Chalgrove Temperance Band. The earliest known photograph of the band is dated 1906. At that time, band practices were held in the top room of the Red Lion public house. Following a break in its history, the band was re-formed in 1972 by three local enthusiasts. In 2007 the band won the London and Southern Counties Fourth Section Championship, and was promoted to the Third Section. In 2011, the band won promotion to the Second Section of the British Brass Band Association. In March 2012, the band took part in its first London and Southern Counties Areas Contest in the Second Section and came second, qualifying for the National Finals in Cheltenham in September 2012. The band performs regularly in the village, including the May Day Parade, the Remembrance Sunday service and concerts in the Village Hall, which is also where it rehearses.

About 14.5 million Baptists belong to congregations affiliated with Southern Baptist Convention, the largest such confederation of Baptists. More than 40% of all Baptists worldwide reside in the United States. The largest denomination among African Americans is the National Baptist Convention, with 7.5 million members, along with the smaller but more liberal Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC), with over 2000 churches and a total membership of 2.5 million. There are numerous smaller bodies, some recently organized and others with long histories, such as the Calvinistic Baptists, General Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Old Regulars, Two-Seed-in-the- Spirit Predestinarian Baptists, and Independent Baptists. There are also Baptists operating independently or in independent congregations outside any denomination. Baptist congregations are self-regulating and autonomous. This autonomy makes identifying a specific creed difficult, and the particular set of religious beliefs of Baptists can vary widely. Baptist Christians played a major role in seventeenth-century English religious history, and many Baptists migrated to the English colonies in that century. Baptist theological reflection informed how the colonists understood their presence in the New World, especially in Rhode Island and Providence Plantations through the preaching of Roger Williams, John Clarke, and others. History = 17th century = Baptists appeared in the American Colonies in the early 17th century among settlers from England. Theologically all Baptists insisted that baptism was the key ritual and should not be administered to children too young to understand the meaning. However some were Arminian holding that God's saving Grace is available to everyone, and others followed Calvinist orthodoxy, which said Grace was available only to the predestined \\"elect\\". Rhode Island and Providence Plantations First Baptist Church in America Roger Williams and John Clarke, his compatriot in working for religious freedom, are credited with founding the Baptist faith in North America.Newport Notables In 1638, Williams established the First Baptist Church in America in Providence, Rhode Island and Clarke was the minister in Newport, Rhode Island when it was organized as First Baptist Church in Newport in 1644. No one disputed the earlier origins of the Providence church until 1847 when the pastor of the Newport church claimed that his church was first. According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively, \\"There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.\\"Brackney, William H. (Baylor University, Texas). Baptists in North America: an historical perspective. Blackwell Publishing, 2006, p. 23. Today, almost without exception Baptist historians agree that the Providence church came first. In 1764, leading Baptist ministers the Reverend James Manning, the Reverend Isaac Backus, the Reverend Samuel Stillman, the Reverend Morgan Edwards and the Reverend John Gano established The College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, the seventh institution of higher education in the original thirteen colonies, with the specific goal of serving as a sanctuary for Baptists who were not widely welcomed at the other institutions which were closely associated with the Congregationalist churches (Harvard College, Yale College, and the College of New Jersey) and the Church of England (the Academy of Philadelphia, King's College and the College of William and Mary). Early controversies Beginning in Providence in 1636‚Äì1637, Roger Williams founded a colony in which religion and citizenship were separated. This same principle was continued in the first charter of 1644 and affirmed by the newly created colonial government in 1647. This principle was explicitly affirmed in the Charter of 1663 which John Clarke wrote and secured. Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was regarded by the neighboring colonies with undisguised horror, and Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Connecticut spent the next 100 years trying to dismember the \\"heretic\\" colony. The other colonies passed laws to outlaw Baptists and Quakers, leading to the hanging of four Quakers in Massachusetts. When Harvard's first president Henry Dunster abandoned Puritanism in favor of the Baptist faith in 1653, he provoked a controversy that highlighted two distinct approaches to dealing with dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The colony's Puritan leaders, whose own religion was born of dissent from mainstream Church of England, generally worked for reconciliation with members who questioned matters of Puritan theology but responded much more harshly to outright rejection of Puritanism. Dunster's conflict with the colony's magistrates began when he failed to have his infant son baptized, believing, as a newly converted Baptist, that only adults should be baptized. Efforts to restore Dunster to Puritan orthodoxy failed, and his apostasy proved untenable to colony leaders who had entrusted him, in his job as Harvard's president, to uphold the colony's religious mission. Thus, he represented a threat to the stability of theocratic society. Dunster exiled himself in 1654 and moved to nearby Plymouth Colony, where he died in 1658.Timothy L. Wood, \\"'I Spake the Truth in the Feare of God': the Puritan Management of Dissent During the Henry Dunster Controversy,\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 2005 33(1): 1-19, = 18th century = Before the American Revolution about 494 Baptist congregations existed in the United States. By 1795 that number had risen to 1152 U.S. Baptist congregations. Revolutionary Virginia Isaac (1974) analyzes the rise of the Baptist Church in Virginia, with emphasis on evangelicalism and social life. There was a sharp contrast between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists and the opulence of the Anglican planters, who controlled local government. Baptist church discipline, mistaken by the gentry for radicalism, served to ameliorate disorder. The struggle for religious toleration erupted and played out during the American Revolution, as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church. Beeman (1978) explores the conflict in one Virginia locality, showing that as population became more dense, the county court and the Anglican Church increased their authority. The Baptists protested vigorously; the resulting social disorder resulted chiefly from the ruling gentry's disregard of public need. The vitality of the religious opposition made the conflict between 'evangelical' and 'gentry' styles a bitter one.Richard R. Beeman, \\"Social Change and Cultural Conflict in Virginia: Lunenburg County, 1746 To 1774,\\" William and Mary Quarterly 1978 35(3): 455-476 Kroll-Smith (1984) suggests the strength of the evangelical movement's organization determined its ability to mobilize power outside the conventional authority structure. J. Stephen Kroll-Smith, \\"Transmitting a Revival Culture: The Organizational Dynamic of the Baptist Movement in Colonial Virginia, 1760-1777,\\" Journal of Southern History 1984 50(4): 551-568 In 1793 representatives from Baptist institutions from across Virginia met up for the Virginia Baptist General Committee, passing resolutions that slavery was not a moral or religious issue and thus decisions surrounding slavery should be left up to politicians. = 19th century =  Slavery and Segregation  In 19th century Virginia, slaves applying for membership in Baptist churches were required to get written approval from their master to join a congregation, and once a part of the congregation Black members would have separate Black deacons who oversaw them. The Baptist churches in America, like the country, split in two over the issue of slavery in the United States. In 1840, the Board of Managers of the Baptist General Convention for Foreign Missions repeated that the slavery question, which it never mentions by name, is not relevant to their work. It already speaks of the question of \\"the continuance of Christian fellowship between northern and southern churches.\\" In 1841, at the annual meeting in Baltimore, \\"leading ministers and members of the Denomination had signed a document repudiating the course of anti-slavery Baptists, and pronouncing the disfellowship of slaveholders an innovation unsanctioned by the usages of the denomination.\\" There was set up an American Baptist Free Mission Society in 1842, whose founding President was Cyrus Pitt Grosvenor. Struggling to gain a foothold in the South, after the American Revolution, the next generation of Southern Baptist preachers accommodated themselves to the leadership of Southern society. Rather than challenging the gentry on slavery and urging manumission (as did the Quakers and Methodists), they began to interpret the Bible as supporting the practice of slavery and encouraged good paternalistic practices by slaveholders. They preached to slaves to accept their places and obey their masters. In the two decades after the Revolution during the Second Great Awakening, Baptist preachers abandoned their pleas that slaves be manumitted. In 1845, the Southern Baptist Convention split from mainline Baptism over the issue of whether slaveholders should be allowed to be appointed as missionaries. In 1885, approximately 80,000 slaves were members of Baptist churches, however being a part of the same congregation did not stop slaveholders from treating their slaves as property and continuing to sell them. In Baptist churches in both free and slaveholding states during this period, people of color were required to sit in a segregated \\"negro pew\\" regardless of whether they were members of the church, were licensed ministers, or even were invited into the pews of other white churchgoers. Organization Though each Baptist church is autonomous, Baptists have traditionally organized into associations of like-minded churches for mutual edification, consultation, and ministerial support. The constituency of these associations is based on geographical and doctrinal criteria. Many such associations of Baptist churches have developed in the United States since Baptists first came to the continent. Until the early 19th century these Baptist associations tended to center on a local or regional area where the constituent churches could conveniently meet. However, beginning with the spread of the Philadelphia Baptist Association beyond its original bounds and the rise of the modern missions movement, Baptists began to move towards developing national associations. The first national association was the Triennial Convention, founded in the early 19th century, which met every three years. The Triennial Convention was a loose organization with the purpose of raising funds for various independent benevolent, educational and mission societies. Over the years, other nationwide Baptist associations have originated as divisions from these two major groups. There are a few smaller associations that have never identified with any of the national organizations, as well as many Independent Baptist churches that are not part of any organization, local or national.  Practices and Beliefs  In the United States, there are some Baptist groups that support and actively attempt to maintain the separation of church and state. At least 14 Baptist bodies, including the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, the Baptist General Convention of Texas, the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., and American Baptist Churches USA financially and ideologically support the mission of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. This organization tries to uphold the traditional Baptist principle of the separation of church and state. On the issue of school prayer, for instance, the Baptist Joint Committee argues that prayer is most pleasing to God when offered voluntarily, not when the government compels its observance.Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty Major Baptist denominations in the U.S. The Handbook of Denominations in the United States identifies and describes 31 Baptist groups or conventions in the United States.Atwood, Craig D., Frank S. Mead, and Samuel S. Hill. Handbook of Denominations in the United States, 12th ed. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 2005. A partial list follows.

From 1907 to 1950 it was known as the Northern Baptist Convention. While its theology was rooted in the same Confessions of Faith as more traditional Baptists, as a rule the ABCUSA churches have adopted a more modernist approach to the Scriptures and are thus more tolerant of doctrinal diversity. The primary strength of the ABCUSA is in the northeast, but it also has a strong presence throughout the midwest, the southwest, and on the west coast. They operate a number of colleges and other benevolent enterprises. =Southern Baptist Convention= The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) is the largest non-Catholic denomination in the United States.BGAV: The Right Choice, Part 2 Its greatest numerical strength is in the south, but it has churches in every state and a strong presence in many northern and western states. The Home Mission Society gave a statement saying that a person could not be a missionary and keep his slaves as property. This caused the Home Mission Society to separate northern and southern divisions. As a result of this the Baptists in the south met in May 1845 and organized the Southern Baptist Convention. Women began making great strides in 1872, when Henry Tupper of the Foreign Mission Board appointed Edmonia Moon for missionary service. She was the first woman to receive this honor.Fletcher, Jesse. The Southern Baptist Convention: A Sesquicentennial History. Broadman and Holman Publishers, 1994. p.74-75, 84-88. In 1888, the Woman's Missionary Union was instituted. Women were recognized and encouraged to form missionary circles and children's bands in churches and Sunday Schools.Barnes, W.W. The Southern Baptist Convention: 1845-1953. Broadman Press, 1954. p.136 Although all Southern Baptists would be viewed as conservative by those outside the tradition, from the late 1970s forward there was a well-orchestrated takeover of the SBC by a conservative/fundamentalist group who wrested control from those who have come to be called \\"moderates.\\" In 1987, some moderates left the Southern Baptist Convention and formed the Southern Baptist Alliance, which later became the Alliance of Baptists. The Alliance is associated with the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists, a group promoting greater inclusion of LGBT people within Baptist life. In 1991, other moderates left the SBC and established the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF), a group emphasizing global missions and historic Baptist values such as local church autonomy, priesthood of all believers and religious liberty. Unlike the Southern Baptist Convention, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship ordains women for ministry. =African-American Baptists= Before the American Civil War, most African American Baptists were, with some notable exceptions, members of the same churches as the whites (though often relegated to a segregated status within the church). After the war they left the white churches to start separate churches and associations. Today there are several historically African-American groups in the United States, including the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., the National Baptist Convention of America, and others. A good number of African-American Baptist churches are dually aligned with a traditionally African American group and the ABCUSA, the Southern Baptist Convention, or the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. =Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF)= The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF) was formed in 1991, largely by moderate Southern Baptists who had been disenfranchised by the concerted, well-orchestrated fundamentalist/conservative restructuring of the Southern Baptist Convention. CBF has been called a quasi-denomination since in many ways it provides many of the benefits of a convention, including ordination of women for ministry, but as yet has not declared itself a denomination. Its primary offices are located in Atlanta, Georgia. =Smaller Baptist groups= There are a number of smaller Baptist associations in the United States which maintain a separate existence from the larger groups for doctrinal reasons. Among these are the Freewill Baptists, the General Baptists, the Primitive Baptists, the Old Regular Baptists, various associations devoted to Landmarkism, the Conservative Baptist Association, the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, and many regional and local associations which do not affiliate with any national group. =Independent (non-aligned) Baptist churches= Independent Baptist churches are completely independent of any association or group, though they usually maintain some sort of fellowship with like-minded churches. They share the traditional Baptist doctrinal distinctives, but they adhere to what they see as a Biblical principle of churches' individuality. Independent Baptists believe that this approach to ministry leaves pastors and people in the church free to work as a local ministry, instead of national work, which, in their view, can be less efficient. Independent Baptists are strictly biblicist in their theology, adhering to the traditional Baptist understanding of the Bible and of faith. The same doctrinal variations that exist within (or between) the Baptist associations exist among Independent Baptists. Independent Baptists operate educational institutions such as: * West Coast Baptist College, Lancaster, California * Baptist Bible College, Springfield, Missouri * Hyles Anderson College, Crown Point, Indiana * Liberty University, Lynchburg, Virginia * Northland Baptist Bible College, Dunbar, Wisconsin, * Pensacola Christian College, Pensacola, Florida * Providence Baptist College, Elgin, Illinois * New England Baptist College, Southington, Connecticut * Heartland Baptist Bible College, Oklahoma City, OK Baptist educational institutions Liberty University maintains its Baptist ties Since the founding of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island in 1764, Baptists have founded various institutions around the United States to assist congregants in Biblical literacy and to train clergy educated in the Bible and the original Biblical languages. Some of these schools such as Brown University and Bates College eventually became more secularized and disaffiliated themselves with their Baptist heritage, but others have maintained close bonds with their original founding groups and goals. Most Baptist churches also offer less formal Biblical education in Sunday schools, and some Baptist groups, such as churches led by John Piper offer online educational materials.  Demographics  = Evangelical Baptist Conventions = According the the 2020 Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Study, 9.2% of Americans belong to Evangelical Baptist congregations. These include the Southern Baptist Convention (5.3%), the Independent Convention (2.5%), the Missionary Convention (less than 0.3%), the Conservative Baptist Association of America (less than 0.3%), the Free Will Convention (less than 0.3%), the General Assembly of Regular Baptists (less than 0.3%), and other evangelical conventions (1%). Among Evangelical Baptists, 52% are women and 48% are men. The majority of Evangelical Baptists are white (85%), followed by Latino (5%), mixed or other (5%), Black (4%), and Asian (1%). The most common age range for adult Evangelical Baptists is 50-64 (31%), followed by 30-49 (30%), 65+ (24%), and 18-29 (15%). = Historically Black Baptist Conventions = As of 2020, 4% of Americans belong to historically Black Baptist congregations, including the National Baptist Convention (1.4%), the Progressive Convention (0.3%), the Missionary Convention (0.3%), Independent Conventions (less than 0.3%), and other historically Black conventions (1.8%). Among Baptists attending historically Black churches, 61% are women and 39% are men. These congregations remain overwhelmingly Black (98%), with a small Latino populations (2%), there is population of less than 1% of white, Asian, or other races. The most common age range for adults in these churches is 30-49 (33%), followed by 50-64 (32%), 18-29 (18%), and 65+ (16%). = Mainline Baptist Conventions = In 2020, 2.1% of Americans belonged to Mainline Baptist congregations. These include the American Baptist Convention (1.5%) and other mainline Baptist conventions (0.6%). Among Mainline Baptists, 56% are women and 44% are men. The majority of Mainline Baptists are white (76%), followed by Latino (9%), Black (8%), mixed or other (6%), and Asian (1%). The most common age ranges for adult Mainline Baptists are 30-49 and 50-64 (both are 29%), followed by 18-29 (24%), and 65+ (19%).

Broadman and Holman Publishers, 2003. Many independent Baptist congregations are staunch fundamentalists, regarding all Baptist associations as too liberal for them to join.On Faith: Guest Voices: Falwell: Independent, Fundamentalist and Pragmatic Many of these congregations have a history of employing evangelism techniques that critics consider too extreme and abrasive for modern American culture. To avoid being mistakenly associated with fundamentalist groups, many moderate Baptist churches have adopted names such as \\"Community Church\\" or \\"Community Chapel\\" that leave out the denomination's name. This fits into a general trend by church planters from many denominations to de-accentuate their denomination's name.

Granada, Spain, d. 1533, Granada) was a judge of the first Audiencia of New Spain, which governed the colony from December 9, 1528 to January 9, 1531. Delgadillo was a native of Granada. He graduated as a lawyer from the University of Alcal√°. The first Audiencia Ever since the conquest by Hern√°n Cort√©s, New Spain had been governed by a military government, generally violent, arbitrary and exploitative of the Indigenous. Hoping to establish a more orderly and just government (and perhaps also to reduce the authority of Cort√©s), on December 13, 1527 the metropolitan government of Charles V in Burgos named a Real Audiencia to take over the government of the colony. This consisted of a president and four oidores (judges). The president was Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n and the oidores were Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Delgadillo, Diego Maldonado and Alonso de Parada. Delgadillo left Spain for the Indies in August 1528. At the time Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was already in New Spain, at P√°nuco, so Charles ordered the judges to assemble in Veracruz and from there make a joint entrance into the capital. However, Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was delayed. The oidores from Spain did not wait for his arrival, but proceeded directly to the capital. They arrived there on December 8, 1528, taking over the government on the following day. They were given a splendid reception by the city government. Beltr√°n arrived a little after the others. Two of them (Maldonado and Parada) were sick on their arrival and soon died. They did not take part in the government. The Audiencia was instructed to improve the treatment of the Indigenous and to conclude the juicios de residencia into the conduct of Cort√©s and his associates Pedro de Alvarado, Alonso de Estrada, Rodrigo de Albornoz, Gonzalo de Salazar and Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino within 90 days. Most of these associates had participated in the government in the proceeding few years while Cort√©s was in Honduras or Spain, with a lot of in-fighting among themselves and injustices to the population, both Indigenous and Spanish. Cort√©s himself was still in Spain, where he was defending his conduct and appealing to Charles concerning his loss of authority. Cort√©s had some success with his appeal, being named Marqu√©s del Valle de Oaxaca and receiving some other honors. Government of the first Audiencia This Audiencia was very corrupt, and Delgadillo participated in the corruption, accumulating a large sum of money. He received a grant of land from the municipal council, which was illegal for the judges, and he had his brother appointed governor of the Zapoteca province. He soon entered into open opposition to Cort√©s, the bishops and the missionaries. The Audiencia banned direct communication with the Court in Spain. This was so effective that Bishop Juan de Zum√°rraga felt the necessity of hiding a letter sealed in wax in a cask, to be smuggled to the Spanish authorities by a confederate sailor. Delgadillo founded the Spanish settlement of Antequera (now Oaxaca) and suppressed a revolt of the Indigenous nearby. He imported the mulberry tree and the silkworm into the colony in 1530, becoming the first to begin sericulture in the New World. He imported the olive tree the following year. The maladministration of the first Audiencia continued until the return of Cort√©s in July 1530. The members of the Audiencia intended to depose Cort√©s, but were prevented by the actions of Bishop Zum√°rraga. Shortly thereafter, the members of the second Audiencia arrived, taking power in January 1531. The second Audiencia was much different from the first, honest, capable and dedicated to good government and fair treatment of the Indigenous. Consequences The members of the first Audiencia were called to answer before other courts. One hundred twenty-five lawsuits were begun. In one of the suits, Cort√©s accused Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, Ortiz de Matienzo and Delgadillo of attempting to usurp his property and powers in New Spain during his absence in Spain in 1528. Delgadillo, like the others, was sentenced to lose all his repartimientos and to pay a large fine. Thereafter Delgadillo returned to Spain, retiring to his native City. There a severe illness brought about by his troubles caused his death.

Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources'. A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of human practices and transactions. It does not stand alone. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to technology (automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education). A market-based economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency. A command-based economy is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed. A green economy is low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. A gig economy is one in which short-term jobs are assigned or chosen via online platforms. New economy is a term that referred to the whole emerging ecosystem where new standards and practices were introduced, usually as a result of technological innovations. The global economy refers to humanity's economic system or systems overall. Range This map shows the gross domestic product (GDP) for every country (2015). Today the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the social science of economics, but may include sociology (economic sociology), history (economic history), anthropology (economic anthropology), and geography (economic geography). Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole are engineering, management, business administration, applied science, and finance. All professions, occupations, economic agents or economic activities, contribute to the economy. Consumption, saving, and investment are variable components in the economy that determine macroeconomic equilibrium. There are three main sectors of economic activity: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Due to the growing importance of the economical sector in modern times,The volume of financial transactions in the 2008 global economy was 73.5 times higher than nominal world GDP, while, in 1990, this ratio amounted to \\"only\\" 15.3 (\\"A General Financial Transaction Tax: A Short Cut of the Pros, the Cons and a Proposal\\" , Austrian Institute for Economic Research, 2009) the term real economy is used by analysts\\"Meanwhile, in the Real Economy\\", Wall Street Journal, July 23, 2009\\"Bank Regulation Should Serve Real Economy\\", Wall Street Journal, October 24, 2011 as well as politicians\\"Perry and Romney Trade Swipes Over ‚ÄòReal Economy'\\", Wall Street Journal, August 15, 2011 to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services,\\"Real Economy\\" definition in the Financial Times Lexicon as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy,\\"Real economy\\" definition in the Economic Glossary which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values (adjusted for inflation), such as real GDP, or in nominal values (unadjusted for inflation).‚Ä¢ Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics, search for real. ‚Ä¢ R. O'Donnell (1987). \\"real and nominal quantities,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, pp. 97-98. Etymology The English words \\"economy\\" and \\"economics\\" can be traced back to the Greek word (i.e. \\"household management\\"), a composite word derived from (\\"house;household;home\\") and ŒΩŒ≠Œºœâ (\\"manage; distribute;to deal out;dispense\\") by way of (\\"household management\\"). The first recorded sense of the word \\"economy\\" is in the phrase \\"the management of ≈ìconomic affairs\\", found in a work possibly composed in a monastery in 1440. \\"Economy\\" is later recorded in more general senses, including \\"thrift\\" and \\"administration\\". The most frequently used current sense, denoting \\"the economic system of a country or an area\\", seems not to have developed until the 1650s.Dictionary.com, \\"economy.\\" The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. October 24, 2009.  History  = Ancient times = Storage room, Palace of Knossos. As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. Sumer developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money, while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on debt, legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.Sheila C. Dow (2005), \\"Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply\\", Journal of Post Keynesian Economics 27 (3), p. 385-391. The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming. The Shekel referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of barley which related other values in a metric such as silver, bronze, copper etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver. For most people, the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In Ancient Greece, where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were bond slaves of the freeholders. The economic discussion was driven by scarcity. = Middle ages = 10 Ducats (1621), minted as circulating currency by the Fugger Family. In Medieval times, what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within social groups. On top of this, the great conquerors raised what we now call venture capital (from ventura, ital.; risk) to finance their captures. The capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the New World. The discoveries of Marco Polo (1254‚Äì1324), Christopher Columbus (1451‚Äì1506) and Vasco da Gama (1469‚Äì1524) led to a first global economy. The first enterprises were trading establishments. In 1513, the first stock exchange was founded in Antwerpen. Economy at the time meant primarily trade. = Early modern times = The European captures became branches of the European states, the so-called colonies. The rising nation-states Spain, Portugal, France, Great Britain and the Netherlands tried to control the trade through custom duties and (from mercator, lat.: merchant) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and public interest. The secularization in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the nobles decreased. The first Secretaries of State for economy started their work. Bankers like Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773‚Äì1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and infrastructure. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state. = Industrial Revolution = S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz, Germany, 1868 The first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723‚Äì1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy, a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari. He defined the elements of a national economy: products are offered at a natural price generated by the use of competition - supply and demand - and the division of labor. He maintained that the basic motive for free trade is human self- interest. The so-called self-interest hypothesis became the anthropological basis for economics. Thomas Malthus (1766‚Äì1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation. The Industrial Revolution was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spreading throughout Europe, North America, and eventually the world. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism (today: protectionism) and led to economic growth. The period today is called industrial revolution because the system of Production, production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods. = Recognition of the concept of ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù = The contemporary concept of \\"the economy\\" wasn't popularly known until the American Great Depression in the 1930s. After the chaos of two World Wars and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy. This was explored and discussed by Friedrich August von Hayek (1899‚Äì1992) and Milton Friedman (1912‚Äì2006) who pleaded for a global free trade and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called neoliberalism. However, the prevailing view was that held by John Maynard Keynes (1883‚Äì1946), who argued for a stronger control of the markets by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called Keynesianism in his honor. In the late 1950s, the economic growth in America and Europe‚Äîoften called Wirtschaftswunder (ger: economic miracle) ‚Äîbrought up a new form of economy: mass consumption economy. In 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith (1908‚Äì2006) was the first to speak of an affluent society. In most of the countries the economic system is called a social market economy. = Late 20th ‚Äì beginning of 21st century = ESET (IT security company) headquarters in Bratislava, Slovakia. With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives instead of industrialization. Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, Tools for Conviviality. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of postmodernism in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st century. With the spread of Internet as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000-2001, the idea for the Internet and information economy is given place because of the growing importance of e-commerce and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of \\"all-connected\\" society is created. In the late 2000s, the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like China, Brazil, and India bring attention and interest to different from the usually dominating Western type economies and economic models.  Economic phases of precedence  The economy may be considered as having developed through the following phases or degrees of precedence. * The ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming. * The industrial revolution phase lessened the role of subsistence farming, converting it to more extensive and mono-cultural forms of agriculture in the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. Commerce became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community. * In the economies of modern consumer societies phase there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology‚Äîthe knowledge economy. In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the three-sector theory. * Primary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. (A coal miner and a fisherman would be workers in the primary degree.) * Secondary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary degree.) At this stage the associated industrial economy is also sub-divided into several economic sectors (also called industries). Their separate evolution during the Industrial Revolution phase is dealt with elsewhere. * Tertiary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary degree.) * Quaternary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the research and development needed to produce products from natural resources and their subsequent by-products. (A logging company might research ways to use partially burnt wood to be processed so that the undamaged portions of it can be made into pulp for paper.) Note that education is sometimes included in this sector. Other sectors of the developed community include : * the public sector or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature- reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions). * the private sector or privately run businesses. * the social sector or voluntary sector.  Economic measures  There are a number of concepts associated with the economy, such as these: * Consumer spending * Exchange rate * Gross domestic product * GDP per capita * GNP * Stock Market * Interest rate * Government debt * Rate of Inflation * Unemployment * Balance of Trade = GDP = The GDP (gross domestic product) of a country is a measure of the size of its economy. The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and GDP per capita. While often useful, GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged.  Informal economy  Black market peddler on graffiti, Kharkiv An informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government, contrasted with a formal economy. The informal economy is thus not included in that government's gross national product (GNP). Although the informal economy is often associated with developing countries, all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion. Informal economic activity is a dynamic process that includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement. By its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measure. No single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit of study. The terms \\"underground\\", \\"under the table\\" and \\"off the books\\" typically refer to this type of economy. The term black market refers to a specific subset of the informal economy. The term \\"informal sector\\" was used in many earlier studies, and has been mostly replaced in more recent studies which use the newer term. The informal sector makes up a significant portion of the economies in developing countries but it is often stigmatized as troublesome and unmanageable. However, the informal sector provides critical economic opportunities for the poor and has been expanding rapidly since the 1960s. As such, integrating the informal economy into the formal sector is an important policy challenge.

The series is based on a pilot film of the same name, which aired on September 30, 1969 as an ABC Movie of the Week. The pilot is based on the 1964 science fiction novel The Immortals, by James Gunn. The series music was composed by Dominic Frontiere, who is primarily known for scoring the sci-fi anthology series The Outer Limits. Although The Immortal was canceled at midseason, episode were rerun by ABC in the summer of 1971. It was later rerun on the American Forces Network in Europe in the 1980s and on the Sci Fi Channel in the 1990s. Series overview Ben Richards is a test car driver for a large corporation owned by billionaire Jordan Braddock. He is 42 years old, but looks young enough to pass for 25‚Äîand he has never been sick a day in his life. Ben's life changes when he donates a pint of blood. When Braddock, who is dying, is given a blood transfusion of his donated blood, and is brought back from the brink of death, Ben's physician, Dr. Matthew Pearce, determines that his O-negative blood contains all known antibodies and immunities. This gives Ben immunity to every known disease and an estimated lifespan five to ten times that of other humans, making him, in the doctor's words, \\"virtually immortal\\". The billionaire decides that he has to control Richards' life so he can access his life-saving blood. When Richards rejects all of Braddock's offers to remain with him, the billionaire has him imprisoned, but he ultimately escapes. Richards tells his fianc√©e Sylvia Cartwright that they can never marry because she would also be imprisoned by Braddock (in the episode \\"Sylvia\\" Richards puts himself in danger to visit Cartwright at her wedding to another man). Richards is now on the run because when Braddock dies (shown in the flashback episode \\"To The Gods Alone\\" which resolved plot points between the pilot and the series), one of his former employees, Fletcher (who did not appear in the pilot), is hired by another billionaire, Arthur Maitland, who also wants access to Richards' blood. The series' dramatic tension is based on the idea that Richards would probably never lose his life if he were to live quietly, since he would never succumb to any known diseases. But his flight from Fletcher puts his life at great risk, constantly engaging in dangerous efforts to avoid capture, and his \\"immortal\\" blood did not make him immune to losing his life from injury. The series primarily focuses on Richards' journeys and the people he meets while trying to avoid Fletcher. A secondary plot involved Richards' search for a brother he has never known, with the implication that that brother may share his gift and thus be at risk from unscrupulous billionaires as well. Ben Richards is imprisoned by a young billionaire, Simon Brent, in an episode titled \\"The Queen's Gambit.\\" In the episode \\"Man On A Punched Card\\" Maitland hires computer programmer Terry Kerwin to track and predict Richards' movements using a mainframe computer. Kerwin was played by Christopher George's real-life wife Lynda Day George, who would co-star on another Paramount TV series Mission: Impossible from 1971 to 1973. The plotline of The Immortal is quite different from that of the book on which it is based (the protagonist of the book was a vagrant, not a test driver, who discovers his immortality when he sells his blood). Instead, The Immortal bears more than a superficial resemblance to the then-recent, very popular TV series, The Fugitive, which still aired in syndicated reruns. That series had ended its four-season run three years before The Immortal began. It is also the mirror of the series Run for Your Life about a man suffering from a terminal disease who wants to experience everything because he is going to die soon, while Richards has to run because he will live virtually forever. The Immortal was cancelled before a proper finale episode could be filmed.

History  James Page was born enslaved in Richmond, Virginia in 1808. About 1838 John Parkhill transported James and his wife to Leon County, Florida. Colonel John H. Parkhill owned Belair Plantation. Page was enslaved as a gardener, carriage driver, as well as a body servant. Parkhill would later influence Page to take up the ministry. In 1851 at Newport, Florida, a Baptist minister ordained James Page as Florida's first and only African-American minister at that time. After Minister Pages' ordination, John Parkhill gave him land for the Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church of Belair, Florida, the first regularly organized (in the white tradition) Black church in Florida. From 1865 and 1870, Reverend Page organized the Bethel Baptist Church in Tallahassee, Florida. Reverend Page's life was a superb example of how slaveholders never ceased their exploitation. They demanded slaves adhere to their brand of Christian religion. Enslaved people were explicitly taught it was God's will for them, while on earth, to suffer, to labor ceaselessly and obey their masters, for an eternal reward in Heaven. Slaveholders found that Black people typically responded more favorably to Black Preachers and Page was a passionate speaker. The Reverend Page, at least outwardly, subscribed to this teaching and acknowledged Blacks as inferior and subservient to whites. As thanks for his proselytizing to hundreds of enslaved people he was rewarded by whites for his humble docility. Reverend Page, however, cannot be judged by modern standards, and must be viewed in the context of his time.Leslie L.

He was editor of the study section of Szachy (Chess) from 1971 to the magazine's closure in 1990. Rusinek became an International Judge of chess composition in 1983, and a Grandmaster of chess composition in 1992. He won over 30 first prizes in composing tourneys. The Oxford Companion to Chess opines that \\"his achievements are likely to rival those of his greatest predecessors\\". Endgame studies To the left is one of Rusinek's better known studies. Black threatens Nb5-d6# or Ne4-d6# and 1.Kb7 Bd5+ does not help, so 1.a7 is necessary. Now 1...Bd5 can be answered with, among other lines, 2.g8Q Bxg8 3.a8Q Nxb6+ 4.Kb7 Nxa8 5.Kxa8 Be6 6.Kb8 and Black must give up a piece for the c pawn, so instead 1...Ba6+ 2.b7. Now 2...Nb5 threatens 3...Nd6# but is met with 3.g8N+ Ke8 4.Nf6+ when 4...Nxf6 loses to 5.a8Q. Instead, therefore, Black plays 2...Ne4 3.g8N+! Ke8 4.Nf6+ and now 4...Nexf6 is possible. This seems to put White in a dilemma, since 5.a8Q loses to 5...Nd5 with 6...Ne7# next move. But instead there is 5.a8B!! when 5...Nd5 is stalemate, so therefore 5...Ne5 6.Kb8 Nc6+ 7.Kc8 Bf1 and again White has a problem because 8.b8Q will lose to 8...Ba6+ 9.Qb7 Ne4 10.Qxa6 Nd6#. 8.b8N is no better: 8...Ne7+ 9.Kb7 Bg2+ 10.Ka7 (10.Nc6 Bxc6+ 11.Ka7 Bd7) 10...Nc8+ 11.Ka6 Bxa8. However, white can draw with a third underpromotion: 8.b8R!!. Now after 8...Ba6+ 9.Rb7, 9...Ne4 is stalemate, and there is no useful way for Black to avoid this. White draws. White's being required to make all three underpromotions in order to draw is exceptionally unusual. In Endgame Magic (Batsford, 1996), John Beasley and Timothy Whitworth comment that it \\"represents a very much greater feat of composition than might at first appear. That it was accomplished with the use of only nine men adds still more to the composer's achievement.\\" Beasley and Whitworth also comment that \\"It is quite easy to construct a position in which White must promote to a rook or bishop in order to avoid giving stalemate,\\" but \\"It is much more difficult to create a position in which White must underpromote to create a stalemate,\\" which is done on two occasions in this study. Rusinek subsequently (64, 27 July 1978) added an introduction to this study which added a promotion to queen to the already existing underpromotions, thus creating an Allumwandlung. This later version is shown to the right. 1.h8R+ is insufficient, since 1...Ke7 will mate quickly. 1.h8Q+ is therefore necessary, and after the forced continuation 1...Qxh8 2.g7+ Qxg7 3.hxg7+ Ke7, the initial position of the original study is reached. Rusinek himself considered this version inferior to the original (aesthetics versus task).

He eventually appeared in 7 episodes of spin-off adventures of his own. He is named after and inspired by the real life Tom√°s de Torquemada. Fictional character biography Originally the leader of The Tube Police, a fascist police force and quasi-religious order in the far future, he became the dictator of the entire human race from its base on Termight (planet Earth). His Empire wages a speciesist war against all alien species, whom Torquemada regards as \\"impure.\\" Torquemada's goal is to keep the human race united by their fear and hatred of all aliens. He is described as being totally evil and having absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. In fact, late in the series, it was revealed (through the actions of Thoth, son of Nemesis the Warlock) that his previous incarnations have included Colonel John M. Chivington, Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, Adolf Hitler and his namesake, the original Torquemada. (He is, however, also a dedicated family man ‚Äì he is distressed when Nemesis kills his children while escaping the Terminators and loves his wife Candida to such an extent he consorts with aliens in an effort to prevent her from divorcing him.) After an accident in a teleporter, Torquemada lost his physical body but continued to survive as a ghostly spirit. He then began possessing the bodies of volunteer Terminators to use for himself. The bodies would rot and die after a short time and have to be replaced. This eventually contributed to Candida's loss of sanity. His catchphrase is \\"Be pure! Be vigilant! Behave!\\" The Terminators Torquemada is served by a fanatical army of soldiers called Terminators, who are constantly at war with all alien races in the galaxy. =Death of a Tyrant= Torquemada's evil reign ended when Candida mysteriously recovered from her madness. Upon hearing the news, he had his then current wife, Sister Sturn murdered and made preparations for his second marriage to Candida. The wedding ceremony ended disastrously when his foe Nemesis appeared with Candida willingly fleeing from the temple with him. Humiliated on live TV, his evil regime quickly crumbled but he still had one last trick. Stealing Nemesis' Blitzspear, he fled to the Hypogeum to activate a \\"Generation Bomb\\" (which would destroy all alien DNA on Earth). Before he could even activate it, Nemesis managed to contaminate him with alien DNA with his claws before using his remaining powers to make sure Torquemada would perish with him. When the bomb exploded, both Nemesis, his Blitzspear and Torquemada were merged and fell into the timestream for all eternity. Family Torquemada's family members who have been depicted include: * Murcalla de Torquemada (mother, alive) * Nostradamus de Torquemada (brother, alive but insane) :He became insane when he was ambushed by the Monads and Torquemada abandoned him to his fate instead of helping him. Torquemada had him committed to a lunatic asylum, and pretended Nostradamus was his senile grandfather. * Candida de Torquemada (wife ‚Äì annulled, second marriage interrupted, alive) * Barbarossa de Torquemada (son, dead) * Pandora de Torquemada (daughter, dead) * Sister Sturn (wife, dead) * Atilla de Torquemada (son by Sister Sturn, alive) Publication *Nemesis the Warlock (by Pat Mills): :List of Nemesis stories As well as appearing in Nemesis the Warlock he has appeared in his own eponymous series: *Torquemada (by Pat Mills): ** \\"The Garden of Alien Delights\\" (with Bryan Talbot, in Dice Man No. 3, 1986) ** \\"Torquemada the God\\" (with Kevin O'Neill, in 2000 AD #520‚Äì524, 1987) ** \\"Torquemada's Second Honeymoon\\" (with Kevin O'Neill, in 2000 AD Annual 1988, 1987) Awards *1984 ‚Äì won Eagle Award for Best Character *1985 ‚Äì won Eagle Award for Favourite Villain (British Section) *1986 ‚Äì won Eagle Award for Favourite Villain (British Section) *1987 ‚Äì won Eagle Award for Favourite Villain (British Section)  See also  * The Redeemer, another Pat Mills creation who (in the Warhammer 40,000 universe) purges mutants and deviants.

Built in 1941 as the fishing trawler Mist, she was acquired by the US Navy in June 1942 and was converted for naval use by George Lawley & Son of Neponset, Massachusetts. She was commissioned on 28 July 1942 and was put into service to patrol the waters around the Boston Navy Yard. NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive: USS YP-422 The vessel was lightly armed with a 3-inch gun and two .30 caliber machine guns. Service history YP-422 was briefly commanded by Lieutenant L. Ron Hubbard, later known as the controversial founder of Scientology. Hubbard was assigned to Lawley & Son Shipyard, in the Neponset area of Boston, Massachusetts in connection with the conversion of the YP-422 from 25 June to 28 July 1942 when she was placed in commission with Hubbard in command. Hubbard was relieved of his command on 1 October 1942, a few weeks after YP-422 underwent a 27-hour training exercise in August 1942. A dispatch sent by the Commandant of the Boston Navy Yard on 25 September 1942 described Hubbard as \\"not temperamentally fitted for independent command\\". Ironically, Hubbard was then given command of the submarine chaser USS PC-815 which also resulted in his being officially reprimanded and relieved of command. In early 1943, YP-422 was dispatched to the Pacific theater of operations to support the Solomon Islands campaign.

Svensky Monastery (Russian: –°–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—å) is a Russian Orthodox monastery located at the confluence of the Desna and Svin Rivers, three miles from Bryansk, Russia. The monastery was originally known as Svinsky, after the Svin River, but the spelling was subsequently changed to Svensky, because \\"svinsky\\" also means \\"of the swine\\" in Russian. Church legends attribute the monastery's foundation to Prince Roman of Bryansk, who was reportedly buried there. As the legend has it, the monastery was founded to mark the place where a miraculous icon of the Theotokos appeared to Roman, the second son of St. Mikhail of Chernigov, and cured him of blindness. A tree where it was found, was chopped down to be used for icon painting. The miraculous icon represents the Theotokos Panachrantos with SS. Anthony and Theodosius. It is popularly attributed to the most celebrated icon-painter of Kievan Rus, St. Alypius from the Kiev Pechersk Monastery. Nikodim Kondakov supposed that the icon was modeled on a mosaic from the central conch of the Assumption Cathedral in the Pechersk Monastery. In the 16th century, the monastery was repeatedly sacked by the Crimean Tatars. After one such raid, Ivan the Terrible donated funds sufficient to build a cathedral of five domes, a refectory church, and a belltower. The cathedral doors of rare craftsmanship were endowed by Prince Ivan Mstislavsky. The church of SS. Anthony and Theodosius was started on 19 May 1566; its vaults suffered a collapse a year later but were restored. SS. Anthony and Theodosius with the Theotokos Panachrantos, an 11th-century icon from the Svensky Monastery. After Russia gained the Left-bank Ukraine by the Treaty of Andrusovo, the liveliest fair in the region was held annually underneath the walls of the Svensky Monastery. Its ties with the Kiev Pechersk Lavra were so close that in 1682 the Svensky Monastery was transformed into a branch of the lavra, its name changed from Svensky to New Pechersk monastery. During this period of Ukrainian domination, Cossack Baroque was liberally applied to its buildings. The Presentation Church, rising in three towers above the main entrance to the abbey, was erected in the late 1680s in the simplified Ukrainian Baroque style. The main cathedral was rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1715. The ancient clocktower was built up to the height of 42 meters. The Saviour Church over the fair gates was constructed in five levels, ringed by a gallery, in 1742. The walls of the monastery were erected between 1749 and 1769. On 30 July 1749 work started on the new cathedral, which was to be modeled on the New Cathedral of the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow. It is believed that its design was commissioned from Ivan Fyodorovich Michurin, who had supervised construction of St Andrew's Church of Kiev. The cathedral of the Svensky Monastery was reminiscent of another structure ascribed to Michurin ‚Äî St. Clement's Church in Zamoskvorechye. A seven-tier Baroque iconostasis from the old cathedral was carefully preserved and assembled in the new structure before it was consecrated in 1758. There was no new construction in the monastery after that. In the 19th century, the cloister declined, especially after the fair had been moved to Bryansk in 1864. A garden of cedars, chestnuts, and cherry-trees was planted to mark its historical location. The Bolsheviks closed the monastery in 1926. Its valuables were expropriated, while the miraculous icon of the Theotokos was given to the Tretyakov Gallery. Michurin's cathedral was blown up; the Church of SS. Anthony and Theodosius (the oldest in the complex) reduced to rubble; the house where Peter the Great stayed before the Battle of Poltava torn down. It was not until the late 1980s that conservation works on the remaining structures started. The monks were readmitted into the monastery in 1992.

In continuous operation since accepting its first patient in December 1842, the hospital was founded as the Georgia State Lunatic, Idiot, and Epileptic Asylum, and was also known as the Georgia State Sanitarium and Milledgeville State Hospital during its long history. By the 1960s the facility had grown into the largest mental hospital in the world (contending with Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in New York). Its landmark Powell Building and the vast, abandoned 1929 Jones Building stand among some 200 buildings on two thousand acres that once housed nearly 12,000 patients. The CSH complex currently encompasses about , a pecan grove and historic cemeteries, and serves about 200 mental health patients. As of 2016 the facility offers short-stay acute treatment for people with mental illness, residential units and habilitation programs for people with developmental disabilities, recovery programs that require a longer stay, and specialized skilled and ICF nursing centers. Some programs serve primarily the central-Georgia region while other programs serve counties throughout the state. History In the first decades of the 1800s there was a movement in several states to reform prisons, create public schools, and establish state- run hospitals for the mentally ill. In 1837, the Georgia State Legislature responded to a call from Governor Wilson Lumpkin, by passing a bill calling for the creation of a \\"State Lunatic, Idiot, and Epileptic Asylum.\\" Located in Milledgeville, then the state capital, the facility opened in 1842. Under Dr. Thomas A. Green (1845‚Äì1879), care of patients was based on the \\"institution as family\\". This modeled hospitals to resemble an extended family. Green ate with staff and patients daily and abolished chain and rope restraints. The hospital population grew to nearly 12,000 in the 1960s. During the following decade, the population began to decrease due to the emphasis on deinstitutionalization, the addition of other public psychiatric (regional) hospitals throughout the state, the availability of psychotropic medications, an increase in community mental health programs, and many individuals moving to community living arrangements. During FY2004-FY2005, the hospital served more than 9,000 consumers (duplicates counted) - from nearly every Georgia county. In 2010, the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities announced that the hospital would be closed, but it has not been; instead, it has become the state's treatment and custodial center for justice system referrals and commitments.

Pohick Creek forms in the vicinity of Burke and flows southeast past the western edge of Fort Belvoir to empty into the tidal Pohick Bay, which itself empties, along with Accotink Bay, into Gunston Cove, an embayment of the tidal Potomac River. Pohick Creek is a popular stream for whitewater kayaking, rafting, and paddling, providing Class II and III rapids along a stretch between Hooes Road (Virginia Secondary Route 636) and the Richmond Highway (U.S. Route 1) at Lorton. Several tributaries of the Pohick Creek are impounded by dams constructed under the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act to prevent soil erosion and flooding. Originally eight dams were planned, but from 1970 to 1985, only six were actually built. * Lake Braddock (Pohick #7) was the first dam built in 1970, and impounds the Pohick Creek in Burke. * Huntsman Lake (Pohick #8) was built in 1973, and impounds the Middle Run in Springfield. * Lake Royal (Pohick #4) was completed in 1977, and impounds the Rabbit Branch in Burke above its confluence with the Sideburn Branch, where it forms Pohick Creek. * Lake Barton (Pohick #2) completed in 1978, impounds a tributary of the Sideburn Branch in Burke. * Woodglen Lake (Pohick #3), which impounds the Sideburn Branch in Fairfax, was completed in 1981. * Lake Mercer (Pohick #1) became in 1985 the final dam completed, impounding the South Run in Springfield.

Introduction  When atoms are deposited slowly onto a flat surface, the first one undergoes a random walk on that surface. Eventually a second atom is deposited; in all likelihood it will eventually meet the first atom. Once the two atoms meet they may bond to form a particle with a higher mass and a lower random walk velocity. Because the bonded particles are now more stable and less mobile than before, they are called an \\"island.\\" Subsequent atoms deposited on the substrate eventually meet and bond with the island, further increasing its size and stability. Eventually the island can grow to fill the entire substrate with a single large grain. The faster the atoms are deposited, the greater amount of atoms on the substrate before any large stable islands form. As these atoms meet, they will bond to their local neighbors before having the chance to migrate to a distant island. In this way a large number of separate islands are formed and can grow independently. Eventually the separate islands will grow to become separate grains in the final film. The island growth model is used to explain how fast deposition techniques (such as sputter deposition) can produce films with many randomly oriented grains, whereas slow deposition techniques (such as MBE) tend to produce larger grains with more uniform structure.

Her CBS Radio talk show 'CrackinUp w/ Gretchen & the Lukes' aired weekly on the Los Angeles station KLSX 97.1 Free FM every 'Fraturday' (their word for Fridays, 11pm-1am pacific). Gretchen had a long run at KLSX as a talk radio host of several different programs over many years up until the station changed to all music format on February 20, 2009. Massey has a history in entertainment of being an actor, comedian and also as a talk show host. In the past, she was lead host of the nationally syndicated radio talk show \\"Radio Girls\\" and was on 97.1 KLSK FM talk radio station in Los Angeles, as co-host of \\"Lauren & Gretchen Uncut.\\" Massey had a love of the theatre and performing from an early age, and attended Dallas's Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. This love evolved into a long journey of writing and performing through many cities with various theater companies, improvisational theatre groups and then as a stand- up comedian later in her life. She is well known for being one of the various presenters on the Playboy TV television show, Sexcetera. Big Brother She was the host of the CBS Big Brother show House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show that was broadcast weekdays on cbs.com, when Big Brother USA is in season. House Calls analyzed the goings-on taking place in the Big Brother USA house and game. Gretchen hosted House Calls with Marcellas Reynolds for its first two years. Due to Marcellas being part of season 7's All-Stars, Gretchen was the sole host. Many assumed Marcellas would return to his co-hosting duties, but due to budget cuts he did not return to House Calls for its fourth season (aired during Big Brother 8). House Calls was canceled after season 10. Gretchen and The Lukes Crackin-Up with Gretchen and The Lukes can now be heard on HotTalkLA. She is married to standup comic Mike Lukas (of The Straight Dope fame), her \\"Gretchen and The Lukes\\" co-host. \\"Gretchen and the Lukes\\" airs on the Los Angeles station KLSX 97.1 Free FM Fridays from 11pm-1am and on San Francisco-based 106.9 Free FM Sundays from 9pm-11pm. Although Gretchen and Lukas do acknowledge being married on air, they are pretending that they are not married to each other for the show, which runs contrary to some Mike Lukas interviews published before the show's debut, mentioning specifically that he just married his longtime girlfriend in her hometown of Dallas, and in addition, Mike Lukas's old personal homepage (miKeluKas.com‚Äîoffline as of late December 2005) identified Gretchen (in name and photos) as his longtime love.

The scale of the poem invited criticism, especially by Wergeland's counterpart, Johan Sebastian Welhaven. In 1845, while on his deathbed, Wergeland revised the poem and republished it under the title Man (Norwegian: mennesket) . Creation =The two spirits= The poem starts out at the beginning of history, with two spirits watching and arguing over the newly created earth. One of them, Phun-Abiriel, is dismayed, because he is eager to create on his own, but unlike God, his thoughts do not take shape. In the process, he also wishes to see God, but can't. Phun-Abiriel's friend, Ohebiel, patiently explains to him that the spirits are not able to see the eternal, and that Phun-Abiriel is considered a newborn spirit or a rash youth. Anyway, Ohebiel loves him, but can't help him from brooding. As they talk, the heavenly host approaches, led by the eldest of spirits, Akadiel. =Life on earth= Then, Akadiel and the host witness the birth of life, as recalled in Genesis, over a period of six days. At the end of this part, Akadiel holds his speech to the still-sleeping human couple, demanding of them that they shall be rulers over themselves first, and then over the creation as such, and honour God in the creation and in themselves. =The soul-giving= Phun- Abiriel (his names formed of the names Phuniel and Abiriel, telling of the two sides of his character), still broods over the sleeping humans below him. He makes up his mind that he would rather rule the earth as a man than be the most lowly of heavenly spirits. He decides he will become the soul of the sleeping man, and the little \\"geist\\" that were in man before him, shall become \\"dream\\", as he himself will be called \\"thought\\". Phun-Abiriel then descends and merges with the sleeping Adam, and as this happens, he ultimately forgets his spiritual self and his background. Ohebiel, watching this, despairs, and wonders what will happen if the woman awakes without soul, and what kind of monster would come from the union of the two. To hinder this, she merges with Eve, after the advice of Akadiel, and she sacrifices herself on behalf of humanity with the words: \\"Man, hope!\\" The history of humanity, at this point, can proceed as planned. The bewildering This second part is the longest section of the epic poem. It follows the life of Adam and Eve, and their recognition as kindred spirits; this section also details Adam's fall in pride and Wergeland's version of the fall of man, here solely on the male account. Then, there are parts of Biblical history detailed, such as Cain and Abel, the great flood, and so on. =Origin of lordships= This part consists of two monologues, one considering secular power, and one considering clerical power, over people's goods and thoughts. =Glimpses of light: the Golden Age= This part tells of the archetypical man, who is both a king and a sage, along with a culture-hero, who teaches people to build cities, till the earth, govern justly and look into themselves for the truth. The woman teaches people agriculture, and is hailed as Isis, Ceres, Frigga and Athena. The man is hailed as Osiris, Crishna, Fu Hsi in China, Baal, Odin, Tuisto, Dionysus, Herakles, Zeus and Saturn. As Man works to enlighten humanity, he is also acknowledged as Kneph, Akhar, Zerouane-Akherene, Huang Di, Fta (Siamese ephitet to deities), Nyame, Kutka, Sommonadokom, Allfaƒëir and eventually Eloah. In the process, the vedam, the Zen, the I Ching, and the ten commandments are established as laws and guidelines. The last names to be given of this amalgam of earthly wisdom are: Hermes, Mimir, Zerdust, Yu the Great, Yao (ruler), Buddha, Manu (Hinduism), Confucius and Moses. In the end, Akadiel approaches and foretells how this golden age of wisdom and prosperity eventually will corrupt itself to the Iron Age, with chained thralls and manipulation. He then tells that humanity, the \\"abiriels\\", eventually will rise and cast off their chains, to make a new priesthood in freedom and brotherly love. =Ruling classes= This part is a return to the theme of the lords and the priests, telling of exploitation and greed on behalf of the few. The voices from the people answer the demands of the lordships. =Interlude of hearts= This part contains scenes of romance, telling how individuals in love with one another can disregard their own potential differences between casts and classes. =Power and deceit= This section tells how the rulers and priests continue their treatment of ordinary people by means of practices such as human sacrifice and dictatorship. This part contains 28 different scenes. =Breakthrough for the human spirit= Philosophers, mostly Greeks, are introduced into the epic poem here; among them are Epicurus, Democritus, Aristotle and Plato. Plato is hailed by Akadiel as the one who perceives most clearly God's overall plan for humanity and the coming of Christ. Also, some of the Jewish sects are introduced, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees. In the end, the prophet Mika foretells the coming of Christ. =Heaven and Hell= This part tells how Wergeland envisioned the difference between the blessed and the unblessed. Characters from the \\"power and deceit\\" section are introduced again; as the tortured ones rejoice, the former rulers recognize themselves as condemned, although they are all in the same place. In Wergeland's spirit-world, hell is a personal state of circumstances. Salvation This third main part concentrates mostly on Jesus and the story afterwards. Jesus is introduced mourning the history of the human race and their toils; he is comforted by Akadiel. Under Akadiel's guidance, Jesus walks out to his task, in a sequence based closely on the gospels. During this section, Jesus delivers a speech, based loosely on the Sermon on the Mount, where he tells the human spirit to acknowledge itself as what it is, through love. This last section of the poem was written for the revised version of 1845. =First great victory of Christianity= The ironic title of this section refers to the Roman Empire\`s transition to Christianity in the fourth century. Wergeland states that the Roman emperor is getting troubled by this sudden onset of peaceful ideology and the denial of power. The emperor then decides to get baptized, because he will then have sway over his people once more. The peaceful approach of Christianity, says Wergeland, is toppled and abused by the powers that be. =Spiritual resurrection of Christ= Here, the poet himself appears, sitting on a hilltop easter morning and contemplating the turn of events the last 1845 years from the coming of Christ to the then- present day. Akadiel addresses Wergeland, and the poet is allowed a glimpse one thousand years into the future as a means of seeing the conditions the world and humanity are in at that time. He awakens every century to see for himself what has happened and witnesses spiritual and political progress and liberation. The conditions he sees include the end of slavery; the liberation of women; and all Christian fractions merging into one, thus making the papacy obsolete, as the last pope dies 600 years from 1845. Eventually, all humanity becomes \\"Christian, each according to the colour of his own character\\". The poem ends in a praise to God, and the poet awakes, reconciled. Differences between the 1829 and 1845 versions Akadiel of the 1845 rendition of this poem was named Messiah in 1829. This made a distinction between Jesus and Messiah, which was not tolerated by the church at the time. The early version was also more dualistic in approach than the later version.

It carries out heritage research, and has expertise in subjects ranging from palaeontology, ethnography and biodiversity research and conservation. Its headquarters and the National Museum (Nairobi National Museum) are located on Museum Hill, near Uhuru Highway between Central Business District and Westlands in Nairobi. The National Museum of Kenya was founded by the East Africa Natural History Society (E.A.N.H.S.) in 1910; the Society's main goal has always been to conduct an ongoing critical scientific examination of the natural attributes of the East African habitat. The museum houses collections, and temporary and permanent exhibits. Today the National Museum of Kenya manages over 22 regional museums, many sites, and monuments across the country.NMK, \\"National Museums of Kenya,\\" 2006-03-31, Museums.or.ke, web: MuseumsOR  Nairobi National Museum of Kenya =Natural History Museum of Kenya= Prehistory The East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society was founded in 1910‚Äì11 by persons with an interest in nature in British East Africa.It descended to the East Africa Natural History Society, an international organization with outlets in a number of countries. In Kenya it is Nature Kenya. The group included two canons of the Church Missionary Society: The Rev. Harry Leakey (father of Louis Leakey) and The Rev. Kenneth St. Aubyn Rogers; some government officials: C. W. Hobley and John Ainsworth, doctors, dentists, big- game hunters and plantation owners. In 1911 they established the Natural History Museum and library with an honorary curator. Aladina Visram put up the money for a one-story, two-room building.This section relies heavily on L. S. B. Leakey, By the Evidence: Memoirs, 1932‚Äì1951, Chapter 8. In 1914 they could afford a paid curator. They brought in Arthur Loveridge, a herpetologist, who arrived in March 1914. Loveridge concentrated on collections, with the members volunteering to contribute specimens, labour and funds. They also ran the museum while Loveridge fought for the British in German East Africa. He returned for a brief stay after the war, only to go to America, where he eventually became a Harvard University professor. =Coryndon Museum= The next curator was A. F. J. Gedye. The museum moved to a new building at the corner of Government Road and Kirk Road. Among the new volunteers for the society were Sir Robert Coryndon, Governor of Kenya. At his unexpected death in 1925, Lady Coryndon established the Coryndon Memorial Fund to build a better museum for the society in memory of her husband. The government offered matching funds for public donations and in 1928 construction began. The building was ready in 1929. Unfortunately no workrooms or storage space had been provided and therefore the Natural History Society declined to move in. The government then bought the old museum and the society used the money to add three rooms, gave its collections to the museum trustees, but retained the library. Everything was moved to the museum. Lady Coryndon donated Sir Robert's books to it. The museum was officially opened on 22 September 1930, as Coryndon Museum, with Victor Gurney Logan Van Someren, a member, as curator. He was given a house on the grounds. In 1930 Evelyn Molony, n√©e Napier was appointed the Museum's first botanist after a grant was given to the Museum by Ernest Carr to fund her employment. During her tenure she established within the Museum a herbarium on East African plants as well as publishing a series of scientific papers on East African flora. The relationship between the museum trustees and the society became problematic, and as a result the two organisations appointed a committee including Sir Charles Belcher, a Kenyan jurist, to stabilise it. The committee turned everything over to the museum except for the library in exchange for annual payments for 15 years to the society. The museum now had a staff. Mary Leakey became part of it and then Louis Leakey, as unpaid curator, in 1941. He stepped in when Dr. van Someren resigned after the board (including Louis) refused to dismiss Peter Bally in a personality conflict. The museum was a center for Leakey operations. In 1945 Louis was hired as paid curator with a new house, as the old one had become run-down. He built up the exhibitions and opened them to Africans and Asians by lowering the admission fee. Until then the museum had been \\"for whites only.\\" The museum was a base for Leakey operations until 1961, when Louis founded the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the grounds nearby and moved himself and his collections to it. He resigned in favour of the next director, Robert Carcasson. =National Museum= Kenya became independent in 1963. The Coryndon Museum was renamed \\"National Museum\\" in 1964 and was included in a new system, the \\"National Museums of Kenya.\\" In 1967 Richard Leakey was having irreconcilable differences with Louis Leakey, his employer in the Centre, and decided to improve the National Museum. His main objection was that it had not been Kenyanized. He and supporters formed the Kenya Museum Associates, which obtained an observer's seat for Richard on the board from Carcasson in exchange for a 5000-pound contribution. Richard did not do much observing, as he departed for the first Omo expedition. The Kenya Museum Associates included Joel Ojal, the museum overseer in the government. On his return from Omo Richard gave his ideas for improvement directly to Joel, who asked the chairman, Sir Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck, to place Richard in a senior position and begin replacing the board with Kenyans of Kenyan extraction, as there were only two out of 16 in that category. The penalty for inaction would be removal of government funding. Richard was at first offered a part-time executive position, which he turned down. Over the next few months much of the board was replaced and in May 1968 the new board offered Richard a permanent post as administrative director, with Carcasson to be retained as scientific director. However, Carcasson resigned and Richard became director. =Gallery of Kenyan Ethnic Communities= This gallery contains artwork by Joy Adamson featuring various Kenyan communities in traditional attire. =Modern events and facilities= On 15 October 2005 Nairobi Museum Galleries closed until December 2007 for an extensive rebuilding program. This was the first major renovation of Nairobi Museum since 1930.

Cast  * Gregory Harrison as Jack Reilly * Melina Kanakaredes as Angela Villanova * Madeline Kahn as Nan Chase * Kelli Williams as Ellie * Anthony DeSando as Tony Amato * Kevin Chamberlin as Victor * Joe Morton as Mitch Cotter * Mary Tyler Moore as Louise Felcott  Premise  New York News is the story of the fictional New York Reporter, a struggling tabloid in the US's largest, most competitive newspaper market, New York City. Major characters included Jack Reilly (Gregory Harrison), an old-style newspaperman (so old-style that he actually went sneaking around in a trench coat); Angela Villanova (Melina Kanakaredes), a young writer who seemingly alternated between admiring Reilly and being in love with him; Nan Chase (Madeline Kahn), a gossip columnist somewhat in the vein of Rona Barrett; and Tony Amato (Anthony DeSando), the paper's leading sports columnist. Supervising all of these talented, high- strung people was Editor-in-Chief Louise Felcott (Mary Tyler Moore), the \\"Dragon\\", who kept the pressure up on these employees and others, including their immediate boss, Managing Editor Mitch Cotter (Joe Morton). The paper's budget cutting and the related attempt of ownership to sell it took their toll on Cotter, who suffered a minor heart attack in the early episodes. Moore was reportedly very unhappy with how her character was written, as a tough, unsympathetic, and unglamourous woman who peered out at her subordinates through thick \\"Coke-bottle\\" glasses. She was reputedly in negotiations to get out of her contract to do the program when this was made unnecessary by CBS's cancellation of it due to low Nielsen ratings two months after its premiere.

The college is organized into three schools: the School of Cinematic Arts, which is home to the animation and cinema programs; the School of Computing, which houses programs in computer and information sciences; and the School of Design, which houses programs in game design, interactive and social media, and digital communication and media arts. The college is part of DePaul University‚Äôs Loop Campus. The College of Computing and Digital Media awards nearly 1/4 of information technology graduate degrees in the state of Illinois. The school offers 16 undergraduate, 25 graduate, and 2 PhD programs in various fields, as well as several joint degrees with other colleges at DePaul University. DePaul has been designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cybersecurity for academic years 2014-2021 by the United States Department of Homeland Security and National Security Agency. History The College of Computing and Digital Media originated as the Department of Computer Science in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 1981 with Helmut Epp as its founding chairman. That same year, the department moved into 243 South Wabash Ave., one of three buildings that DePaul University had purchased shortly before and named as part of its Loop Campus. On 1 July 1995, the department was established as a freestanding school within DePaul, the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems. Initial degree offerings by the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems included undergraduate and graduate degree programs in Computer Science, Telecommunications and Information Systems, and Software Engineering. The school also offered a Master of Science degree in Management Information Systems jointly with the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems and DePaul's College of Commerce. Over the next several years, the school added several undergraduate and graduate programs in computer science-related fields, as well as joint degree programs with other colleges at DePaul. In 2000-2001, the school expanded into graphics/animation with the BS in Computer Graphics and Animation. BS and BA programs in digital cinema were introduced during the 2003-2004 academic year. As the school became a prominent provider of technology arts degrees in addition to computer science and information technology degrees, it was renamed to better reflect its program offerings. =From the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems to College of Computing and Digital Media= On April 15, 2008 the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems changed its name to the College of Computing and Digital Media. The college was then organized into two schools: the School of Computing and the School of Cinema & Interactive Media. In 2015, a third school, the School of Design, was added. Because the design-centered programs were moved from the School of Cinema & Interactive Media into the School of Design, it was renamed the School of Cinematic Arts to better reflect its program offerings, which are exclusively animation and film/television. Academics The school‚Äôs original name ‚Äî Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems ‚Äî denotes its three prominent degree programs at the time of its founding in 1995. While these programs continue to be prominent, current technology science growth areas also include information and network security. In addition, the school has become a prominent provider of technology arts degrees in such disciplines as cinema, animation, and game design and programming. The school's prominence in these areas was demonstrated when 18 of the school's students developed the popular computer game Octodad. In 2015, animation student Carter Boyce was the school‚Äôs first recipient of a Student Academy Award for his film Die Flucht. The college currently enrolls over 5,000 students in 16 undergraduate, 25 graduate, and 2 doctoral programs. =The Institute for Professional Development = Continuing education and certificate programs are offered by the college‚Äôs Institute for Professional Development. The institure has various programs in Big Data and Data Science Technologies, Cloud Computing Technologies, Database Technologies, Management, Network Technologies, Software Development, and Special Topics in IT. =Course OnLine= Course OnLine is the College of Computing and Digital Media's customized technology for the capture and rebroadcast of classroom activity. The system captures four components: audio, video, PC screen, and Whiteboard. Within two hours of the end of a class, the pieces are synchronized and uploaded to Desire2Learn, a course management system through which instructors may post announcements, assignments, course notes, and various other supplements to the lecture content. While Course OnLine is frequently used by students to take an entire class on the Internet, it also provides a supplement for traditional classroom students, allowing them to replay the classroom lecture throughout the term of the course.

It is an LGPL- and/or EPL-licensed client-side and server-agnostic solution, and includes support for professional JavaScript development, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit and high-level client-server communication.  Framework  qooxdoo is entirely class-based, tries to leverage the features of object- oriented JavaScript and is based on namespaces. Most modern browsers are supported, including Gecko (Firefox, Mozilla, SeaMonkey), Presto (Opera), Trident (Internet Explorer, RealPlayer, Winamp), WebKit (Chrome, Safari). It includes an API reference that is auto-generated from Javadoc-like comments. Among the accompanying tool set is a comprehensive JavaScript parser that is an integral part of the automatic build process and is used to optimize, compress, link and deploy custom applications, and generate documentation. Internationalization and localization of applications are supported. qooxdoo can be downloaded as a comprehensive SDK.  GUI toolkit  Despite being a pure JavaScript framework, qooxdoo is quite on par with GUI toolkits like Qt, Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) and others with respect to implementing user interfaces. It offers a set of widgets that resemble elements of native desktop applications. Built-in support for keyboard navigation, focus and tab handling and drag and drop is provided. Dimensions can be specified as static, auto-sizing, stretching, percentage, weighted flex or min/max or even as combinations of these. All widgets are based on flexible layout managers, which are instrumental to many advanced layout abilities. Interface description is done programmatically in JavaScript for enhanced performance. Defining the user interface needs no HTML, and styling the interface needs no Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Simple appearance themes are used to style colors, icons and other visual properties; they also support runtime switching..  Object-oriented programming  qooxdoo uses a closed form to define new classes. The global class constructor takes two arguments, the name of the new class and a map that provides values for a set of predefined keys, like 'construct' (the constructor method hook), 'statics' (for static class attributes and methods), 'members' (for instance attributes and methods) and 'destruct' (for the destructor). This (possibly large) map represents the class definition. Classes can be derived from other classes using the 'extend' keyword. The following application skeleton gives an impression of how that works. The code will create a small application with a button that features a tooltip and opens an alert box when pressed. You can also run and edit this code in an online Playground: qx.Class.define(\\"custom.Application\\", { extend : qx.application.Standalone, members : { main : function() { this.base(arguments); // Create button var button1 = new qx.ui.form.Button(\\"First Button\\", \\"icon/22/apps/internet-web-browser.png\\"); // Document is the application root var doc = this.getRoot(); // Add button to document at fixed coordinates doc.add(button1, {left: 100, top: 50}); // Attach a tooltip button1.setToolTip(new qx.ui.tooltip.ToolTip(\\"A nice tooltip\\", \\"icon/32/status/dialog-information.png\\")); // Add an event listener button1.addListener(\\"execute\\", function(e) { alert(\\"Hello World!\\"); }); } } }); Interfaces and mixins are defined and used in a similar fashion.  Ajax  While being a client-side and server-agnostic solution, the qooxdoo project does include optional RPC server implementations (currently in Java, PHP, Perl and Python) to demonstrate client-server communication. An abstract transport layer supports queues, timeouts and implementations via XMLHttpRequest, Iframes and Scripts. Like the rest of qooxdoo, this layer relies on event- based programming to simplify asynchronous communication.

It is directed by Anant Balani and written by Subhash Ghai. It stars Bengali actor Victor Bannerjee, Perizaad Zorabian and Divya Dutta. It was filmed on location in Mumbai's Jogger's Park. The film released in 2003 and did well at the box office, opening the way for a new genre of films like Mumbai Matinee and Morning Raga. Plot The film opens at a Rotary Club function to honour a retired Justice Jyotin Chatterjee. The judge has served the profession all his life with honour and spotless integrity. As he is about to retire, he recognises there will now be a void in his life. His wife remarks to reporters that neither he nor she knows what he would do after he retires. Retired life is not easy for the ageing judge. The younger generation is bolder and quicker than he was in his time. He is invited as the guest of honour at many functions. But he finds that his stump speech about the venerable and time- tested legal profession falls flat. The youngsters wish to know when the law will relax its grip on their issues (principally around love, romance and sex). The judge admits that love makes the world go round and urges the youngsters to enjoy their youth but to do so responsibly. The judge also agrees (after some initial reluctance) to a suggestion from his family and visits Joggers Park to get some exercise. He finds that the Park moves at the pace of its younger regulars, much too quickly for him. He wonders if he will ever catch up. Around this time he meets Jenny Suratwala at Joggers Park. Jenny is a young and vivacious freelance model and event planner. One of his speeches had made an impression on her young mind, and she wishes to learn more about him. They become friends. As their friendship deepens, they discover a new world in each other. Jenny learns from the judge's vast experiences, and the judge uses her perspectives to enter and appreciate the younger generation. Jenny brings an element of need. She is faced with a legal problem around the ownership of her late father's apartment, and the judge helps her fight and win her case. The friendship deepens. The judge is taken by her exhilarating views and wishes to see more of her. She, too, pines for him when they are apart. Around this time, some of Jenny's younger male colleagues are perturbed by this relationship. It thwarts them from pursuing Jenny, and it is not socially acceptable because of the conspicuous age difference. They resolve to find a way to end it, and settle on stalking the couple and taking pictures of their intimate moments. (The film is not clear about any sexual activity, but the pictures are sufficient to destroy the judge's reputation and marriage.) On one occasion, Jenny discovers them taking pictures, and she angrily berates them and destroys some of the pictures. Jenny finally admits she is in love with the judge. Meanwhile, the judge is faced with a family problem of his own. His son has been caught having an affair. His daughter exposes the incident and asks the judge, the vanguard of honour, to deliver judgement. The judge strongly reprimands his son and orders him to end the affair and seek forgiveness from his family. The family honour comes first. Jenny has an upcoming birthday. One of her friends is planning the party. She invites the judge to attend the party and openly profess his love for her. If he truly meant his speeches, then he must act accordingly and express his feelings without fear or remorse. On the day of the party, a strange man shows up at the judge's house. He is Tariq Ahmed, the editor and publisher of a local tabloid. Jenny's jealous colleagues brought the photos to his tabloid, and Tariq intercepted them just in time to avoid publication. It turns out that Tariq owes a debt of gratitude to the judge for having helped him with a difficult case several years ago. He turns the photos over to the judge's daughter. The daughter confronts the judge. This incident also involves the family honour. The judge is compelled to end his relationship with Jenny. Several years later, the judge runs into Jenny at the airport. Jenny is now married and has a child. They greet each other warmly and Jenny introduces him (her fourth boyfriend, the one she loved very much) to her husband. They fondly remember their previous association as the film ends.

The film stars Prithviraj and Saranya Bhagyaraj. It was released to positive reviews.http://www.behindwoods.com/features/Reviews/reviews1/parijatham/parijatham- review.html Plot Santhosh (Prakash Raj) and Seetha have a son named Surendhar (Prithviraj). Sumathi (Saranya Bhagyaraj) is the daughter of Sarath Babu. She lived in a palatial house and enjoyed a luxurious life in her childhood. However, her father loses his textile business and is pushed to poverty. Seetha moves to the house opposite Sumathi's house. Her husband and son are still back in their city, waiting to finish training. Sumathi approaches her to work as a maid. Seetha becomes impressed at first sight by Sumathi's wise and sensible character and takes her as her maid. After a few days, Seetha comes to know that the house she has moved into was initially owned by Sumathi's family. She gets influenced by Sumathi's modesty, kindness, and good nature. Sumathi also had the habit of writing novels, one of which she shared with Seetha. Seetha imagined her son and Sumathi as the characters in the story, which gave her the opportunity to react differently. Assuming her son and Sumathi are fictional characters in the story, she expresses her desire to make Sumathi her daughter-in-law. At first Sumathi is shocked, but she accepts her request happily. Seetha communicates this arrangement over the phone to her husband and son that she has chosen her daughter-in-law. However, she did not reveal the name or identity of Sumathi, because she wants it to be a surprise when they meet her in person. Unfortunately, Seetha dies in an accident before her husband and son's arrival, which leaves a suspense as to who the daughter-in-law is. After his mother's death, Surendhar vows to locate and marry a girl identified by her mother. Since Sumathi is a maid in the house and is much poorer compared to Seetha's family, she does not reveal she is the one. Sampooranam (Bhagyaraj), Surendhar's close friend, moves into their house to snoop around and find out the girl identified by Seetha. As a father, Santhosh didn't have patience and wanted his son to have a good life. This led him to choose a rich girl, completely opposite of what Seetha would have chosen. Passed many twists and turns, Sampooranam succeeds in identifying that Sumathi was the girl Seetha chose. His main evidence was Sumathi's published novel, the one she shared to Seetha. Surendhar happily marries Sumathi with Santhosh and Sampooranam's blessings. The story ends with Sumathi remembering the words of Seetha, that she has always imagined Sumathi to be the wife of her son.

Ravichandran, starring Ajith Kumar and Jyothika in lead roles, alongside an ensemble supporting cast including Nagesh, Sivakumar, Sayaji Shinde, Vivek, Yugendran, and Kovai Sarala. Miss World 1999 winner Yukta Mookhey appeared in a song as a solo item number. It was released on 17 August 2001, earning critical acclaim and achieving commercial success.  Plot  Two families stay in identical bungalows, adjacent to each other, tracing their friendship to over 40 years. Their respective progenies Chinna (Ajith Kumar) and Chella (Jyothika) are childhood buddies, their easy camaraderie and strong bonding carried over to their adult years. The two of them study in the same college, same class, zoom together on the motorbike, their togetherness at home and college, as accepted a fact as it was in films like the Prashanth and Shalini starrer Piriyadha Varam Vendum. Somewhere along the way, the duo falls in love, throwing some soft glances at each other when the other is not looking. Their college mate Karna (Yugendran), makes devious plans to separate the duo and make Chella his. He does not seem to have any running feud with Chinna, is quite friendly with the duo, and does not seem to be particularly in love with Chella. Chinna laps up all that Karna tells him about Chella loving him, and is heartbroken and goes out on a business trip. Chella, persuaded by both families to marry an NRI, boldly informs them that she loved Chinna and would marry him. The two families are happy. Chinna returns home and learns of the preparation for his engagement ceremony. Feeling that since Chella loved Karna, it must be family pressure that must have forced her to agree. Chinna then backs out. It is Chella's turn to be indignant about Chinna's mistrust of her love, and after giving him a piece of her mind, she backs out, with Chinna pleading for acceptance. After a period of separation, during which all ties between the two families are severed, Chella's family soon come to realize that they cannot live without their dearest friends (and lover). The two families then reunite.

The producers had initially approached Aishwarya Rai and then Simran to appear in the lead roles, with their refusals leading to the casting of Jyothika. Miss World 1999, Yukta Mookhey was roped in to appear in an item number. Ajith gained mass image before the filming so producer Ravichandran expressed his doubts to Ezhil about carrying on with such a family oriented film with an action hero like Ajith in hand. But Ezhil was confident about Ajith‚Äôs capabilities in pulling off varying roles. Twin bungalows were erected in Prasad Studios for the film by art director Prabhakaran as the director could not locate a twin bungalow in the same compound. One house was built to feature antiques and the other with modern artifacts and computers. During the making of the film, Ajith was admitted to a Chennai city hospital for a surgery of his backbone causing a month's delay in the film.  Release  The film opened to positive reviews with The Hindu critic labelling it as \\"reasonably interesting\\", with Ajith's performance being praised as \\"natural and neat\\". The success of the film prompted Ezhil, Ajith and Jyothika to team up for a venture the following year with Raja. It went on to win Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, securing second place in the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Family Film and Ajith winning a special prize from the committee for his performance. It also saw awards for Sai for Best Costume Designer, Prabhakaran for Best Art Director, Kovai Sarala for Best Comedian and Vidyasagar for Best Music Director. Jyothika was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Tamil for her portrayal of Chella.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Vidyasagar.

Career Johnny Mann and his vocal group The Johnny Mann Singers were involved in several classic rock 'n' roll and rockabilly recording sessions for Johnny Burnette (including \\"God, Country and My Baby\\"), The Crickets and several 1957‚Äì1958 sessions with Eddie Cochran, who was also signed to Liberty Records in Hollywood. As bandleader with the Johnny Mann Singers, he and the group recorded approximately three dozen albums, hosted the TV series titled Stand Up and Cheer (1971‚Äì1974), and was the musical director for the 1967-69 ABC-TV late night talk show, The Joey Bishop Show. He was also musical director of The Alvin Show, and was the voice of Theodore. Mann was also choral director for the NBC Comedy Hour. The Johnny Mann Singers' instrumental \\"Cinnamint Shuffle (Mexican Shuffle)\\" hit the US pop chart in 1966. Their next single, a cover version of \\"Up, Up and Away\\", became the hit version of the song on the UK Singles Chart, over taking the US hit version by The 5th Dimension. The version also won a Grammy Award in 1968 in the Best Performance by a Choir of Seven or More Persons category. In total, Mann was nominated for five Grammys, two of which he won. The Johnny Mann Singers performed a strongly patriotic musical presentation at the 1972 Emmy Awards telecast hosted by Johnny Carson. Following their performance, Carson returned to the stage and declared \\"War Bonds are available in the lobby\\", a sarcastic comment on the group's flag- waving. The remark offended some conservative viewers around the country. Mann wrote a number of radio jingles, the most famous being the \\"Sound of the City\\" jingle for KSFO in San Francisco, California. This jingle became as requested as many of the songs played by KSFO in the era of Don Sherwood, and it was adapted by Mann for other radio stations around the country which included KFRC (AM) in San Francisco and CKLW in Windsor, Ontario. Mann can be seen on YouTube videos at a Los Angeles recording studio directing his six-voice jingles singers while they sing logos for radio station KRTH-FM (K-Earth 101). Mann was credited as \\"Johnnie Mann\\" in some of his earlier works. His group's most notable alumna was Vicki Lawrence. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. In April 2014 at the age of 85, he was a guest conductor of The South Carolina School of the Arts, at Anderson University's spring gala where he led the university choir in performing the Johnny Mann Singers arrangement of \\"Up, Up and Away\\". At the song's conclusion, the audience of about 1,000 stood in Mann's honor. Death On June 18, 2014, Johnny Mann died of heart failure at age 85 at his home in Anderson, South Carolina. On June 28, 2014, at his memorial service, Evans Whitaker, president of Anderson University (SC) announced the creation of the Johnny Mann Center for Commercial Music at Anderson University in his memory.

In Virginia, the U.S. Highway runs from the Tennessee state line near Weber City north to the Kentucky state line near Pound. US 23, which is known as Orby Cantrell Highway for most of its course, is a four-lane divided highway that follows Corridor B of the Appalachian Development Highway System through Southwest Virginia. The U.S. Highway serves as the main east-west highway of Scott County and the primary north-south highway of Wise County. US 23 runs concurrently with US 58 from Weber City to Duffield and with US 58 Alternate between Big Stone Gap and the independent city of Norton. Route description View north along US 23 at SR 732 just north of the Tennessee state line south of Weber City US 23 enters Scott County at the Tennessee state line south of Weber City immediately north of the northern end of the US 23 freeway that becomes Interstate 26 in Kingsport. At the state line, US 23 has a partial interchange with the northern end of SR-36 (Lynn Garden Drive) and SR-346 (Carters Valley Road). US 23 passes through a gap between Cloud Ridge and Long Ridge at the state line, then crosses the North Fork Holston River on the John M. Johnson Memorial Bridge. The U.S. Highway enters the town of Weber City as Main Street, which parallels Norfolk Southern Railway's Appalachia Division as a four-lane undivided highway. At the north edge of the town, US 23 intersects US 58 and US 421 (Hilton Road); the three highways run concurrently with the railroad through Moccasin Gap, where Moccasin Creek passes through Clinch Mountain. US 23, US 58, and US 421 enter the town of Gate City; U.S. Route 23 Business, U.S. Route 58 Business and U.S. Route 421 Business pass through the center of town while the mainline of the U.S. Highways follows the flank of Clinch Mountain to the south of town. US 23, US 58, and US 421 receive their three business routes at an interchange west of Gate City. The U.S. Highways parallel the railroad and Little Moccasin Creek west between Clinch Mountain to the south and Moccasin Ridge to the north. The highways curve north and parallel the Clinch River to Clinchport, where the road meets the southern end of SR 65 and begins to follow Stock Creek. US 23, US 58, and US 421 pass by Glenita, where the railroad splits north to pass through the Natural Tunnel, the centerpiece of Natural Tunnel State Park. After passing through the Devil's Racepath, US 58 and US 421 split from US 23 as Daniel Boone Trail just south of the town of Duffield. US 23 passes through the town, where the highway parallels the Appalachia Division rail line and the North Fork Clinch River through a gap between Powell Mountain and Cliff Mountain. The U.S. highway briefly enters Lee County while following the river between Powell Mountain and Walden Ridge to its source at Wildcat Summit at the Lee-Wise county line. Northbound US 23 near Duffield US 23 follows Wildcat Creek and becomes a freeway adjacent to Mountain Empire Community College south of Big Stone Gap. The U.S. Highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 23 Business and US 58 Alternate; the latter highway joins US 23 in a concurrency. The two highways have a diamond interchange with SR 610 (Powell Valley Road) before following the southern flank of Little Stone Mountain to Little Stone Gap, where the freeway enters the city of Norton. US 23 and US 58 Alternate have a partial cloverleaf interchange with Kentucky Avenue south of downtown Norton. The highways curve north over a rail line and SR 74 before reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange where US 58 Alternate splits east on Norton Coeburn Road, which heads west toward downtown Norton as SR 283. US 23 leaves the city of Norton and receives the other end of US 23 Business (Esserville Road) at Esserville. A short distance to the north, US 23 enters the town of Wise, where another US 23 Business splits northeast as Norton Road to serve the county seat of Wise County. The U.S. Highway receives the north end of its business route (Main Street) before the highway crosses the Tennessee Valley Divide at Indian Mountain. US 23 descends along Indian Creek to the southern end of its fourth business route, which heads into the town of Pound as Indian Creek Road. The U.S. Highway briefly enters the town limits while receiving the north end of the business route, Main Street.

Trotsky was harshly critical of Weisbord's decision to strike out on his own with a new parallel organization: > \\"I cannot adopt your standpoint. Your criticism of the American League seems > to me one-sided, artificial, and terribly exaggerated. You throw the League > and the right wing together, which shows that you utterly disregard the > fitness of things. You make fun of the publishing activity of the League and > counterpose your 'mass action' to it. Have you any mass activity behind you? > Before one turns to the masses, one must construct a principled basis. One > begins as a propaganda group and develops in the direction of mass action. * > * * > > \\"You declare yourself loyal to the International Left Opposition. > Organizationally this is not the case. This can therefore be understood only > in the sense of a general solidarity of ideas.  If the solidarity of > ideas with the Left Opposition really means anything to you, you must build > a bridge back to the League....\\"Leon Trotsky, \\"A Reply to Albert Weisbord,\\" > October 10, 1931, in Writings of Leon Trotsky (1930-31). Revised paperback > edition. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1973; pp. 385-386. Weisbord was moved by Trotsky's publicized rebuke to enter into unity negotiations with the CLA, although differences in personality and perspective proved to be insurmountable and the CLA terminated the talks in October 1932. The CLS maintained an independent existence throughout its existence. In 1935 it briefly flirted with dissolving into the Workers Party of the United States formed by the joining of forces of A.J. Muste's American Workers Party with Cannon's Communist League of America, a decision which was ultimately rejected. \\"We shall not join the Workers Party, but we have no doubt but the best elements who may have gathered for the moment within the fields of the Workers Party will eventually find themselves fighting shoulder to shoulder with us,\\" the CLS declared.\\"Shall We Join the Workers Party? The Class Struggle, vol. 5, no. 3 (March 1935). =Dissolution= The Communist League of Struggle passed silently from the scene in the spring 1937, with no announcement made of the group's demise made in the final issue of its official organ. =Membership size= The Communist League of Struggle (CLS) did not publish a tally of its membership. Given the fact that the Communist League of America (Opposition), the group from which it split, had a membership of \\"less than 200\\" during the 1931-1933 period, it seems highly probable that the CLS began with a membership of fewer than 50. The group seems to never have attained critical mass and to have dwindled to a small handful of activists during its final years. The group was severely weakened by the death of one of its leading members, the Polish-born Sam Fisher, of tuberculosis in early 1935, at the age of 27. An expelled member of the Communist Party, Fisher was active in the organization of unemployed workers in New York City and as an organizer for the United Laundry Workers Union and was the New Jersey organizer for the CLS.Vera Buch, \\"Sam Fisher (1907-1935),\\" The Class Struggle, vol. 5, no. 2 (February 1935), pg. 1. =Official organs= The primary journal of the Communist League of Struggle was a mimeographed newsletter called The Class Struggle. The publication was issued approximately monthly with occasional combined issues. The first issue appeared in May 1931 and the final issue, the 53rd overall, was dated \\"April/May 1937.\\"For a complete transcribed run of this publication, see The Class Struggle at Weisbord.org.

He is the founding director of the Development Innovation Lab at the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics. Kremer served as the Gates Professor of Developing Societies at Harvard University until 2020. In 2019, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, together with Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, \\"for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.\\" Early life and education Michael Robert Kremer was born in 1964 to Eugene and Sara Lillian (n√©e Kimmel) Kremer in New York City. His father, Eugene Kremer was the son of Jewish immigrants to the US from Austria-Poland. His mother, Sara Lillian Kremer was a professor of English literature, who specialized in American Jewish and Holocaust literature. Her parents were Jewish immigrants to the US from Poland. He graduated from Harvard University (A.B. in Social Studies in 1985 and Ph.D. in Economics in 1992). Career A postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1992 to 1993, Kremer was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Chicago in Spring 1993, and professor at MIT from 1993 to 1999. From 1999, he was a professor at Harvard, and re- joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 2020. Kremer has focused his research on poverty reduction, often as it relates to education economics and health economics. Working with Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo (with whom he shared the 2019 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics), he helped establish the effectiveness of randomized controlled trials to test proposed antipoverty measures. Describing Kremer‚Äôs early use of pioneering experimental methods, Duflo said that Kremer ‚Äúwas there from the very beginning, and took enormous risks . . . .

Kremer is a member of Giving What We Can, an effective altruism organization whose members pledge to give 10% of their income to effective charities. He is founder and president of WorldTeach, a Harvard-based organization which places college students and recent graduates as volunteer teachers on summer and year-long programs in developing countries around the world. He is also co- founder of Precision Agriculture for Development (PAD), a non-profit organization that leverages the global emergence of the mobile phone to provide digital agronomic advisory services to smallholder farmers at scale. Kremer started the advanced market commitment, which focuses on creating incentive mechanisms to encourage the development of vaccines for use in developing countries, and the use of randomized trials to evaluate interventions in the social sciences. He created the well-known economic theory regarding skill complementarities called Kremer's O-Ring Theory of Economic Development. In 2000, Kremer, along with Charles Morcom, published a study recommending that governments fight elephant poaching by stockpiling ivory and so that they can proactively flood the market if elephant populations decline too severely. In his widely cited paper ' Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990 ' Kremer studied economic change over the last one million years. He found that economic growth increased with population growth. In May 2018 Kremer was awarded the Boris Mints Institute Prize for Research of Strategic Policy Solutions to Global Challenges. Kremer led a panel on the reformation of education systems at the International Growth Centre's Growth Week 2010. He is the husband of DFID chief economist Rachel Glennerster.

The peak is a popular hiking destination for many (especially Calgary locals) since there is a well maintained trail that makes its way to the summit. During summer month weekends, it is common for a dozen or more people to reach the summit. Resembling a resting moose on the horizon, the peak was named Moose Mountain in 1949. A Forestry Service fire lookout exists upon the summit, the third building to have occupied the site for this purpose since the first was built in 1929. Some scenes in the film Brokeback Mountain were shot on and around Moose Mountain. Scenes in the first season of the television series Tin Star were also shot on Moose Mountain. Members of the public who summit are requested to respect the privacy of the fire lookout staff. As many as 8000 visitors, local and international, are recorded each season. The lookout staff are responsible for over 5000 square kilometres of forest. The lookout staff detects, maps and reports forest fires to a central location, initiating fire suppression. In consideration of the quantity of visitors and the importance of attentiveness of the staff, it is critical that they not be distracted from their duties. Members of the public are requested to be conscious of inclement weather, and act accordingly. It is NOT recommended to be above the tree line during pending or active lightning storms. Precaution must be taken in view of the active helicopter landing pad, located on the west side of the summit. (Submitted by a former Moose Mountain Lookout Employee) There are two annual trail running events that go up Moose Mountain: Moose Mountain Trail Races (16 km, 29 km, and 42 km distances), and Iron Legs Mountain Races (60 km, 50 miles, and 100 km distances).

Synopsis Mary was the attempt by Mary Tyler Moore to return to network television after the triumph of her sitcom (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) from 1970 to 1977. Her sitcom having not been renewed at her producers' request (they didn't want it to get \\"stale\\"), she had taken a year off before returning to television to conquer the variety format. Moore's supporting cast included a repertory company of young actors and actresses, most notably Swoosie Kurtz, Dick Shawn, Michael Keaton, Merrill Markoe, David Letterman and James Hampton, an established orchestra led by Alf Clausen, and the well-regarded Tony Stevens dancers, and the program had a light, breezy feel. Moore went on David Letterman's show in 1983, where he brought up the variety show. Letterman said, \\"I learned an awful lot.\\" \\"So did I,\\" Moore jumped in. \\"Don't do it again,\\" she laughed. Reception Ratings for the series were low, and CBS cancelled Mary after three episodes; at the time, variety shows in general were falling out of fashion. It ranked 64th out of 114 shows that season with an average 16.1/25 rating/share. However, Moore would tweak the format and try it again with a similar program (The Mary Tyler Moore Hour) later in the same season.

He was ranked 25th on Professional Photographers list of 100 most influential photographers. Klein trained as a painter, studying under Fernand L√©ger, and found early success with exhibitions of his work. He soon moved on to photography and achieved widespread fame as a fashion photographer for Vogue and for his photo essays on various cities. He has directed feature- length fiction films, numerous short and feature-length documentaries and has produced over 250 television commercials. He has been awarded the Prix Nadar in 1957, the Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in 1999, and the Outstanding Contribution to Photography Award at the Sony World Photography Awards in 2011  Life and work  Klein was born in New York City into an impoverished Jewish family. He graduated from high school early and enrolled at the City College of New York at the age of 14 to study sociology. He joined the US Army and was stationed in Germany and later France, where he would permanently settle after being discharged. In 1948, Klein enrolled at the Sorbonne, and later studied with Fernand L√©ger. At the time, Klein was interested in abstract painting and sculpture. In 1952, he had two successful solo exhibitions in Milan and began a collaboration with the architect Angelo Mangiarotti. Klein also experimented with kinetic art, and it was at an exhibition of his kinetic sculptures that he met Alexander Liberman, the art director for Vogue. He moved on to photography and achieved widespread fame as a fashion photographer for Vogue and for his photo essays on various cities. Despite having no formal training as a photographer, Klein won the Prix Nadar in 1957 for New York, a book of photographs taken during a brief return to his hometown in 1954. Klein's work was considered revolutionary for its \\"ambivalent and ironic approach to the world of fashion\\", its \\"uncompromising rejection of the then prevailing rules of photography\\" and for his extensive use of wide-angle and telephoto lenses, natural lighting and motion blur. The New York Times' Katherine Knorr writes that, along with Robert Frank, Klein is considered \\"among the fathers of street photography, one of those mixed compliments that classifies a man who is hard to classify.\\" Klein's most popular photographic works are Gun 1, New York (1955), The Holy family on bike (Rome, 1956), Cineposter (Tokyo, 1961), Vogue (fashion models in the streets of New York, Rome and Paris for Vogue magazine, 1963), Love on the Beat (Serge Gainsbourg album sleeve, 1984), Club Allegro Fortissimo (1990) and Autoportrait (a book of painted contact prints, 1995). The world of fashion would become the subject for the first feature film Klein directed in 1966, Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?, which, like his other two fiction features, Mr. Freedom and The Model Couple, is a satire. He has directed numerous short and feature-length documentaries, including the cin√©ma v√©rit√© documentary Grands soirs et petits matins, the 1964 documentary Cassius the Great, re-edited with new footage as Muhammed Ali, The Greatest in 1969. He has produced over 250 television commercials. A long time tennis fan, in 1982 he directed The French, a documentary on the French Open tennis championship. His work has sometimes been openly critical of American society and foreign policy; the film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum once wrote that Mr. Freedom was \\"conceivably the most anti-American movie ever made.\\"  Filmography  = Documentary films = * Broadway by Light (1958).

Founded January 1, 1603 as 'Villa de Salamanca' by the Viceroy Gaspar de Zuniga and Acevedo, fifth Earl of Monterrey, who was originally from Salamanca (Spain). The town was founded in the lands of Bajio, after cattle ranchers and poor farmers, a few Spaniards, and small groups of Otomi Indians who formerly occupied a village named Xidoo, already lived in the area. In recent years, many refineries have opened, and Salamanca has grown rapidly to become an important site for manufacturing and service industry in the region. Also, the University of Guanajuato has made many scientific contributions to develop agricultural and industrial technologies, giving a boost to the local and regional industries. The city reported a 2010 census population of 260,759. The fourth-largest city in the state (behind Le√≥n, Irapuato, and Celaya), it is also the largest of four places called \\"Salamanca\\" in Mexico. Cuisine Salamanca's cuisine is very diverse because, thanks to the oil refinery, it is a city that has people from all over the country, from cities such as Veracruz, Oaxaca and Mexico City. Each of these cities has its own variety of food, so one can find enchiladas, wheat gorditas, pambazo, hamburgers, its famous carnitas (pulled pork), arrachera, cabrito(goat), birria, barbecue, cecina, and pizza. There are food stands on virtually every street corner. Many types of locally made icepops & ice cream are also popular in the city. Industry The petrochemical industry is the primary one in the city, giving rise to numerous companies and bus transport services available for employees. The strategy was to boost the creation and development of the so-called \\"industrial corridor\\" of the Bajio. The largest Pemex refinery in Mexico is located in Salamanca, and it is the 11th largest crude oil refinery in the world.Mexican Refinery Lines Impoundment With Geomembrane Also noteworthy is CFE Thermoelectric, a source of significant employment in the municipality. In Feb 2014, Mazda Motor Company opened its North American plant outside of Salamanca. At full production, the plant is expected to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year and employ over 4,600 workers. About 30 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States will be sourced from this factory. Communications = Road links= Autopista Salamanca-Le√≥n It is possible to get to Salamanca by Mexican Federal Highway 45, which links the cities of Quer√©taro, Celaya, Irapuato, Silao and Le√≥n; as well as Mexico City through Mexican Federal Highway 57. Also Mexican Federal Highway 43 links south to Morelia and Lazaro Cardenas. =Air transportation= While the city itself doesn't have an airport, it can be served by the Baj√≠o International Airport (BJX), which serves the entire state of Guanajuato; the airport itself is about 50 kilometers away. =Rail transportation= Mexico hasn't had any long-distance rail passenger service since 2000 (except for a tourist line in the northwest), however there are plans to build a statewide Interurban Railway linking the same cities currently linked by Highway 45, in addition to the state's capital. However, this project has been stalled for at least 10 years. Article on the Tren Interurbano's status. Retrieved 2008-10-24. =TV/Radio stations= There are four available AM radio stations in the city: XEMAS, XEEMM, XEZH, XESAG, as well as one local TV channel available to local cable subscribers. Culture The city has a rich craft industry, especially statues of wax, bronze, and pewter, and is also the location of the headquarters of the Center for the Arts of Guanajuato. The former convent of San Juan de Sahag√∫n and its church (with 12 monumental altarpieces artistically carved with 24 carat gold-plated sheet), and the former parish of St. Bartolm√© Apostol are located within the city.

Orion, as a later design, after the initial plans for the Crew Exploration Vehicle led to development of the Orion. The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) was a component of the U.S. NASA Vision for Space Exploration plan. A competition was held to design a spacecraft that could carry humans to the destinations envisioned by the plan. The winning design was the Orion spacecraft. Although it was originally conceived during the Space Exploration Initiative during the 90s, official planning for the vehicle began in 2004, with the final Request For Proposal issued on March 1, 2005, to begin a design competition for the vehicle. For the later design and construction phases, see Orion (spacecraft). The Orion CEV became part of NASA's Constellation Program to send human explorers back to the Moon, and then onward to Mars and other destinations in the Solar System. After Constellation was cancelled, it was envisioned for emergency evacuation of the International Space Station, then retained for revived Solar System exploration plans.  Competition  The concept for the vehicle was officially announced in a speech given by George W. Bush at NASA Headquarters on January 14, 2004. The Draft Statement of Work for the CEV was issued by NASA on December 9, 2004, and slightly more than one month later, on January 21, 2005, NASA issued a Draft Request For Proposal (RFP). The Final RFP was issued on March 1, 2005, with the potential bidders being asked to answer by May 2, 2005. NASA had planned to have a suborbital or an Earth orbit fly-off called Flight Application of Spacecraft Technologies (FAST) between two teams' CEV designs before September 1, 2008. However, in order to permit an earlier date for the start of CEV operations, Administrator Michael D. Griffin had indicated that NASA would select one contractor for the CEV in 2006. From his perspective, this would both help eliminate the currently planned four-year gap between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010 and the first crewed flight of the CEV in 2014 (by allowing the CEV to fly earlier), and save over $1 billion for use in CEV development. On June 13, 2005, NASA announced the selection of two consortia, Lockheed Martin Corp. and the team of Northrop Grumman Corp. and The Boeing Co. for further CEV development work. Each team had received a US$28 million contract to come up with a complete design for the CEV and its launch vehicle until August 2006, when NASA would award one of them the task of building the CEV. The teams would also have to develop a plan for their CEV to take part in the assembly of a lunar expedition, either with an Earth orbit rendezvous, a lunar orbit rendezvous, or with a direct ascent. The two teams were composed of: *Northrop Grumman associated with Boeing as subcontractor for the Spiral One, Alenia Spazio, ARES Corporation, Draper Laboratory and United Space Alliance *Lockheed Martin associated with EADS SPACE Transportation, United Space Alliance, Aerojet, Honeywell, Orbital Sciences, Hamilton Sundstrand, and Wyle Laboratories (awarded the contract August 31, 2006). Each contractor-led team included subcontractors that provided the lunar expedition astronauts with equipment, life support, rocket engines, and onboard navigation systems. The planned orbital or suborbital fly-offs under FAST would have seen the competition of a CEV built by each team, or of a technology demonstrator incorporating CEV technologies. Under FAST, NASA would have chosen the winner to build the final CEV after actual demonstration of this hardware. Fly-offs are often used by the U.S. Air Force to select military aircraft; NASA has never used this approach in awarding contracts. However, as Administrator Griffin had indicated he would abandon the FAST approach, NASA pursued the more traditional approach of selecting a vehicle based on the contractors' proposals. On August 31, 2006, NASA announced that the contract to design and develop the Orion was awarded to Lockheed Martin Corp. According to Bloomberg News, five analysts it surveyed prior to the award announcement tipped the Northrop team to win. Marco Caceres, a space industry analyst with Teal Group, had projected that Lockheed would lose, partly because of Lockheed Martin's earlier failure on the $912 million X-33 shuttle replacement program; after the contract award he suggested that Lockheed Martin's work on the X-33 gave it more recent research and development experience in propulsion and materials, which may have helped it win the contract. According to an Aerospace Daily & Defense Report summary of a NASA document explaining the rationale for the contract award, the Lockheed Martin proposal won on the basis of a superior technical approach, lower and more realistic cost estimates, and exceptional performance on Phase I of the CEV program. Lockheed Martin planned to manufacture the crewed spacecraft at facilities in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.  Proposals  NASA Constellation officials announcing the selected Orion contractor Aug. 31, 2006, at NASA Headquarters = Original designs = Lockheed's proposed craft was a small Space Shuttle shaped lifting body design big enough for six astronauts and their equipment. Its airplane-shaped design made it easier to navigate during high-speed returns to Earth than the capsule-shaped vehicles of the past, according to Lockheed Martin. According to the French daily Le Figaro and the publication Aviation Week and Space Technology, EADS SPACE Transportation would be in charge of the design and construction of the associated Mission Module (MM). The head of the Lockheed team was Cleon Lacefield. The Lockheed Martin CEV design included several modules in the LEO (low earth orbit) and crewed lunar versions of the spacecraft, plus an abort system. The abort system was an escape tower like that used in the Mercury, Apollo, Soyuz, and Shenzhou craft (Gemini, along with the Space Shuttles Enterprise and Columbia [until STS-4] used ejection seats). It would be capable of an abort during any part of the ascent phase of the mission. The crew would sit in the Rescue Module (RM) during launch. According to the publication Aviation Week and Space Technology, the RM would have an outer heat shield of reinforced carbon-carbon and a redundant layer of felt reusable surface insulation underneath in case of RCC failure. The RM comprised the top half of the Crew Module (CM), which comprised the RM and the rest of the lifting-body structure. The CM included living space for four crew members. In an emergency the RM separates from the rest of the CM. The RM would seat up to six crew members, with two to a row, and the CM has living space and provisions for four astronauts for 5-7 days. Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) could be conducted from the CM, which could land on land or water and could be reused 5-10 times. The mission module would be added to the bottom of the CEV for a lunar mission, and would be able to hold extra consumables and provide extra space for a mission of lunar duration. It would also provide extra power and communications capabilities, and include a docking port for the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM). On the bottom of the lunar CEV stack would be the Propulsion or Trans-Earth Injection Module (TEIM) which would provide for return to the Earth from the Moon. It would probably incorporate (according to Aviation Week) 2 Pratt & Whitney RL-10 engines. Together, the RM/CM, MM, and TEIM made up the Lockheed Martin lunar stack. The original idea was to launch the CM, MM, and TEIM on three separate Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELVs), with one component in each launch. This vehicle would need additional modules to reach lunar orbit and to land on the Moon. However, this plan was to be altered according to the CFI (Call for Improvements), described below. Unlike the well-publicized Lockheed Martin CEV design, virtually no information was publicly available on the Boeing/Northrop Grumman CEV design. However, it is instructive to note that most publicly released Boeing designs for the canceled Orbital Space Plane (OSP) resembled the Apollo capsule. It was possible that the Boeing CEV is a capsule rather than a lifting body or plane design.Image Display = Changes to original bids = Sean O'Keefe's strategy would have seen the CEV development in two distinct phases. Phase I would have involved the design of the CEV and a demonstration by the potential contractors that they could safely and affordably develop the vehicle. Phase I would have run from bid submissions in 2005 to FAST (by Sept 2008) and down- select to one contractor. Phase II would have begun after FAST and involved final design and construction of the CEV. However, this schedule was unacceptably slow to Mike Griffin, and the plan was changed such that NASA will issue a \\"Call for Improvements\\" (CFI) after the release of the ESAS for Lockheed Martin and Boeing to submit Phase II proposals. NASA chose Lockheed Martin's consortium as the winning consortium on August 31, 2006. Completed Orion MPCV for Artemis 1 (November 2019)  Post Constellation  After reviewing the Augustine Report, and following congressional testimony, the Obama administration decided to exclude Constellation from the 2011 United States federal budget. On February 1, 2010, the President's proposed budget was released, which included no funding for the project, and it became law on April 15, 2011. The Orion CEV would survive the cancellation for future mission to the Moon, near earth asteroids, and Mars. It was renamed the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle as it would now be a single vehicle rather than the multiple designs originally proposed and launch on the Space Launch System. The Orion MPCV is the major crewed element of NASA's current Artemis Program. The vehicle is currently scheduled for its first flight with the SLS in 2020 on Artemis 1 with its first crewed flight on Artemis 2. Lockheed Martin has been contracted for up to 12 vehicles. = Asteroid Redirect Mission = The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), also known as the Asteroid Retrieval and Utilization (ARU) mission and the Asteroid Initiative, was a space mission proposed by NASA in 2013. The Asteroid Retrieval Robotic Mission (ARRM) spacecraft would rendezvous with a large near-Earth asteroid and use robotic arms with anchoring grippers to retrieve a 4-meter boulder from the asteroid. It would then be visited by the Orion spacecraft in lunar orbit on Exploration Mission 5 in the mid 2020s. It was later changed so that the asteroid would be brought to the Exploration Gateway Platform where the Orion would then visit it. ARM was cancelled by the Trump Administration in 2017. The Orion MPCV approaching the Lunar Gateway on Artemis 3 = Artemis Program = The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out predominately by NASA, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such as the European Space Agency (ESA), JAXA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) with the goal of landing \\"the first woman and the next man\\" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region by 2024. NASA sees Artemis as the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon. The Orion MPCV will be used as the main crew transport and logistics vehicle. It will be launched using the Space Launch System Block 1 and later the SLS Block 1B. Using the EUS, it will be able to transport crew as well as a logistics module to the Lunar Gateway. Once at the Gateway, the crew will embark on the Human Landing System (HLS) to the lunar surface for excursions eventually lasting up to 6 weeks.

The site is adjacent to Fisgard Lighthouse National Historic Site, the first lighthouse on the west coast of Canada. Both the fort and lighthouse are managed and presented to the public by Parks Canada. History =Background= Rodd Hill was named after John Rashleigh Rodd, 1st Lieutenant on under Capt. John A. Duntze. Rodd was later promoted to rear admiral in 1877; vice admiral in 1884, and admiral in 1888. He died in 1892.BCGNIS listing \\"Rodd Hill\\" Guns were first installed here in 1864 to protect Esquimalt Harbour. Britain's Royal Navy began using Esquimalt harbour in the 1840s, at first merely for anchorage, watering and for lumber; but the establishment of three hospital huts during the Crimean War of 1854‚Äì56 marked the start of what is still an active naval base of the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1862, the Royal Navy's Pacific Squadron was relocated to Esquimalt harbour from Valpara√≠so, Chile (where it had used floating storeships rather than built facilities ashore). This increased presence, eventually including storehouses and workshops ashore, would require some form of coastal defence to deter naval attack by a potential enemy. This need was reinforced by the influx of American gold miners during the Fraser River Gold Rush of 1858, and by the armed standoff of U.S. and British forces during the San Juan Islands Pig War of 1859 and continuing tensions associated with that dispute until its resolution in 1871. It was not until after the Colony of Vancouver Island had joined the mainland of British Columbia in 1866, and then Canada in 1870, that the first fixed coastal defences were emplaced to protect the naval base. During the Great Eastern Crisis in 1877‚Äì78, increased tension between Britain and Russia over the latter's declaration of war on Turkey focused attention on the lack of defences for Britain's only naval station on the western seaboards of both North and South America. Volunteers for artillery training were mustered in Victoria on 18 May, while Lt-Col De La Chevois Irwin, Inspector- General of Artillery at Kingston, Ontario, was sent (by train, across the USA) to organize the defences. Five batteries of guns (mainly 64-pr naval rifled muzzle loader) were constructed quickly, using earthen ramparts shored with timber. The largest guns of these defences were three 7-inch RML guns at Macaulay Point (covering the entrance of both Victoria and Esquimalt harbours), and one 8-inch RML on Brothers Island (at the mouth of Esquimalt harbour). The Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Squadron, Admiral de Horsey, inspected the new batteries and declared them inadequate; the local artillery militia could only muster enough gunners to serve half the guns, and as local citizens, it was felt that they might be inclined to give preference to guns defending Victoria rather than the naval base. De Horsey recommended that a permanent garrison of 100 Royal Marine Artillery, modern guns, and a submarine minefield be established as permanent defences. =Construction= The Canadian and British governments did not reach a defence agreement on the matter until 1893. During this time, the old guns and emplacements were still Victoria and Esquimalt's only fixed defences against attack. The 1893 agreement boiled down to this: Group image of Royal Marine Artillerymen garrisoned at Fort Rodd Hill, 1897. The British government would supply: * guns, equipment, stores, and submarine mining buildings, to a total of ¬£53,080; * half the estimated cost of the defence works (¬£30,000); * half the cost of annual maintenance (¬£500); * and a garrison of 75 Royal Marine Artillerymen. The Dominion of Canada would provide: * all the land and buildings (save the submarine mining establishment); * ¬£10,000 towards the maintenance of the Royal Marine Artillery garrison; half the estimated cost of the defences (¬£30,000); * half the cost of annual maintenance (¬£500); * and maintain and expand the local militia. The Royal Marine Artillery garrison, composed of specialists with two years' training, arrived in 1894. They were joined by officers and men of the Royal Engineers, to oversee construction of the permanent defences. The original plan called for Chinese labour to be used in construction, but local newspapers lobbied against this, and more expensive European (i.e., \\"white\\") day labourers were employed. Fort Rodd Hill featured three 6-inch disappearing guns. Between February 1894 and October 1897, two separate forts were constructed: one at Macaulay Point (site of earlier earthwork batteries), and an entirely new location at Rodd Hill, a bluff of rock overlooking the western side of the narrow entrance to Esquimalt harbour. Both forts would each mount three 6-inch disappearing guns (Mk VI barrels on a Mk IV mounting). Because of limitations of space in Rodd Hill, two of these guns were mounted with a common magazine in \\"Lower Battery\\", while the third required a separate battery (along with an underground magazine, loopholed wall, water supply, guardhouse, etc.) on another, higher hill some 200 meters away, named, logically, \\"Upper Battery.\\" These guns were sited in concrete emplacements ten feet thick, which were in turn protected by the rock massif of the hillside into which they were sunk. The barrels were normally kept down in the loading position, within the protection of the concrete emplacement (which also had an overhead metal shield). Using a central Observation Post and remote electric dial system to pass target information, the guns would be loaded and aimed while in the \\"down\\" position. Only when actually about to fire, would the large hydro-pneumatic system raise the 5-tonne barrel up over the parapet. The strength of the system was that the barrel was exposed to the enemy for a minimal amount of time, and with naval guns of the time firing on a flat trajectory, it was virtually impossible for an enemy ship to drop a shell on the emplacement, with its sloping rock glacis in front. Disadvantages of the system included a slow rate of fire (perhaps one shot every two minutes), and a propensity for the complicated hydro-pneumatic system to leak. The 6-inch guns used \\"non-fixed ammunition\\", that is, the explosive cartridge that propelled the shell was stored and loaded separately from the shell or shot. Cartridges were made of raw silk, and stored in wooden crates in a special high-security section of the underground magazine. There were five types of shell on the Fort Rodd manifest in 1897: High Explosive (Lyddite), Armour-piercing, Common Pointed (for non-armoured maritime targets), and Shrapnel. The other class of projectile (and the one most often fired) was a solid steel shot (without any cavity for explosives or fuses, it was cheapest to produce). The shells and shot all had the same service weight of 94 pounds (to simplify calculation of elevation and depression) and diameter of ; therefore, lengths of the various types varied. The Belmont Battery is one of several artillery encampments at Fort Rodd Hill. The encampment includes two quick-fire 12-pdr guns. In addition to these medium guns (intended to fend off an attack by up to six enemy light cruisers), smaller quick-firing guns were sited, in order to deal with the potential threat of fast, unarmoured torpedo boats. At Fort Rodd, a separate emplacement, called Belmont Battery was constructed to house two Quick-Firing 12-pdr guns, which were assisted by two sets of \\"Defence Electric Lights\\" (searchlights), which were powered by diesel engines and generators concealed in an engine room built into the landward side of a hill. For heavy, \\"counter-bombardment\\" defence, a battery of 9.2-inch guns was built at Signal Hill, on the east side of Esquimalt harbour; in the event, these guns did not become active until 1912, and even then were rarely fired, as the concussion caused significant damage to windows in Esquimalt village, directly below the battery. The Royal Marine Artillery garrison was supplanted in 1899 by a larger garrison of Royal Garrison Artillery personnel, along with a detachments of Royal Engineers, including one specially trained in submarine mining. The local Canadian artillery militia continued to receive instruction and practice in gunnery, and became very proficient, winning several national competitions. Annual training schemes brought both Imperial and Colonial troops into sham battles and exercises, including a full-scale night assault on Fort Rodd Hill and Esquimalt naval base in 1902. =20th century= By the time of the Second World War, the original guns were considered obsolete. In 1944 a new QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun in twin mounts was installed. The fort was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1958. On 28 June 1985 Canada Post issued 'Fort Rodd Hill, B.C.' one of the 20 stamps in the \\"Forts Across Canada Series\\" (1983 & 1985). The stamps are perforated 12¬Ω x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.

The film was made by Les Films Corona and Winchester and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was based on the novels Mayerling by Claude Anet and L'Archiduc by Michel Arnold and the 1936 film Mayerling, directed by Anatole Litvak, which dealt with the real-life Mayerling Incident. Plot In the 1880s, Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria (Sharif) clashes with his father, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria (Mason) and his mother Empress Elisabeth (Gardner), over implementing progressive policies for their country. Rudolf soon feels he is a man born at the wrong time in a country that does not realize the need for social reform. The Prince of Wales (Robertson Justice), later to become Britain's King Edward VII, provides comic relief.

He published a dissertation on Nordic types of brooches in 1897. He was also the father of Bertil Almgren, who followed in his father's footsteps in also becoming a professor of Scandinavian and Comparative Archaeology at Uppsala University. Career Oscar Almgren studied under the Swedish archaeologists Hans Hildebrand and Oscar Montelius. The latter was a leading archaeologist in Europe at the time, and also a childhood friend of Almgren's father. In 1908 Almgren became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, and in 1913 he became Sweden's first professor of Scandinavian and Comparative Archaeology, teaching at Uppsala University. Increasing blindness eventually made the position untenable, and in 1925 Almgren had to leave his post; two years later Sune Lindqvist, a former student, took the professorship. Oscar Almgren's son, Bertil Almgren, was born in 1918, when Oscar Almgren was in his 50s. With his son's help and a photographic memory, Oscar Almgren was able to continue his research; Bertil Almgren, as a child, would read academic texts out loud to his father, and starting from the age of eight would accompany him to the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, taking notes of lectures and discussions. The experiences were formative for Bertil Almgren, who in 1965 became, like his father, a professor of Scandinavian and Comparative Archaeology at Uppsala University. Personal life Almgren was born on 9 November 1869, and died on 13 May 1945, at the age of 75.

It was founded by Fateh Ali Khan and Ali Baksh Khan, was initially sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala State in Punjab and was known for ghazal, thumri, and khayal styles of singing. The most influential Patiala singer is Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. Characteristics This gharana tends to favour pentatonic ragas for their ornamentation and execution of intricate taans. Ektaal and Teentaal are the most common taals chosen by members of this gharana. Besides khyal, exponents sing the Punjab-Ang thumri. The special feature of Patiala is its rendering of taans. These are very rhythmic, vakra (complicated) and firat taans, and are not bound by the rhythmic cycle. Taans with clear aakar are presented not through the throat but through the naabhi (navel). This gharana has been criticized for neglecting basic raga characteristics such as the primary development octave and for overusing ornaments and graces (thumri style) without considering the nature and mood of the raga.Patiala Gharana 'Profile' on Indian Raga website Published 12 June 2010, Retrieved 14 August 2019 Exponents * Bade Ghulam Ali KhanArticle on Patiala Gharana in Dawn (newspaper), 'Classical music has healing effect on listeners' Published 3 May 2008, Retrieved 14 August 2019 *Shiv Dayal Batish *Kumar Mukherjee * Fateh Ali Khan (Qawwali singer)https://www.britannica.com/art/qawwalihttps://sarangi.info/vocal/ashiq/(not to be confused with 1935 born Bade Fateh Ali Khan, later known by the same name listed below) *Mohammad Hussain Sarahang of Afghanistan *Ali Baksh Khan *Barkat Ali Khan, brother of Bade Ghulam *Munawar Ali Khan, son of Bade Ghulam *Mazhar Ali Khan, Jawaad Ali Khan, Raza Ali Khan: grandsons of Bade Ghulam *Bade Fateh Ali Khan *Amanat Ali Khan *Hamid Ali Khan *Rustam Fateh Ali Khan, (son of Bade Fateh Ali Khan)https://patari.pk/home/artist/Rustam-Fateh-Ali- Khan *Asad Amanat Ali Khan *Shafqat Amanat Ali *Ghulam Haider Khanhttps://dailytimes.com.pk/418463/ustad-ghulam-haider-khan-passes-away/ *Mohammad Aizaz Sohail *Ghulam Ali *Farida Khanum *Johar Ali Khan *Lakshmi Shankar *Nirmala Devi *Prasun Banerjee *Meera Banerjee *Parveen Sultana *Jagdish Prasad *Samrat Pandit *Surinder Kaur *Sanjukta Ghosh *Vasantrao Deshpande *Rahul Deshpande *Som Dutt Battu *Ajoy Chakraborty *Kaushiki Chakraborty *Shantanu Bhattacharyya * *Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan*  References  Category:Gharana Category:Vocal gharanas Category:Music schools in India Category:Indian classical music Category:Classical music in Pakistan Category:Music schools in Pakistan ","title":"Patiala gharana"},{"id":"6640765","text":"The Jack Abramoff CNMI scandal involved the efforts of Jack Abramoff, other lobbyists, and government officials to change or prevent, or both, Congressional action regarding the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and businesses on Saipan, its capital, commercial center, and one of its three principal islands. Among the issues he worked on was keeping Congress from imposing the federal minimum wage for workers in the CNMI.  Background Abramoff took on the Northern Mariana Islands as a client in 1995. Abramoff and his law firm were paid at least $6.7 million by the CNMI government from 1995 to 2001. The CNMI is a US commonwealth and thus may apply the \\"Made in USA\\" label to goods manufactured on Saipan. Frank Murkowski, then Republican Senator from Alaska and chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, submitted a bill to extend the protection of U.S. minimum-wage labor laws to the workers in the CNMI. In testimony before the Senate, it was described that 91% of the private-sector workforce were immigrants, and were being paid barely half the U.S. minimum hourly wage. Stories also emerged of workers forced to live behind barbed wire in squalid shacks without plumbing. A Department of the Interior report found that \\"Chinese women were subject to forced abortions and that women and children were subject to forced prostitution in the local sex-tourism industry.\\" The Senate passed the Murkowski worker reform bill unanimously, but the bill was then blocked by Tom DeLay in the House. Lobbying In 1993, the government of the CNMI hired Preston Gates to lobby for it. Between October 1993 and September 2001, the firm was paid about $6.7 million by the CNMI government, about 72% of the government's overall lobbying payments. The CNMI government was one of the firm's biggest clients. In 1995, Abramoff, employed at Preston Gates, took on the CNMI as a client. The government sought to retain exemptions from U.S. immigration and minimum wage laws. In October 1996, the contract with Preston Gates expired. The CNMI government broke its own laws by continuing to pay the firm - The initial Preston Gates contract with CNMI was from June 1, 1995 - June 30, 1996, for about $860,000. After the expiration of the contract, then-Governor Froilan C. Tenorio's office continued to pay Preston Gates, despite the lack of a valid contract, until January 11, 1998 when Governor Pedro P. Tenorio had been inaugurated, a grand total of $5.21 million. (Between October 1996 to October 1997, the total was just over $3 million.) The payment without contract was later judged illegal in an investigation by the CNMI Office of the Public Auditor. Abramoff later arranged an all-expenses paid trip to Saipan for Tom DeLay on New Year's Eve in 1997. Although House ethics rules at the time prohibited House members from accepting such gifts from lobbyists, the trip was funded directly by the CNMI and thus was technically allowable. An internal memo from Preston, Gates, and Ellis stated that these sort of trips are \\"one of the most effective ways to build permanent friends on the Hill.\\" While on the trip, at a benefit dinner for Willie Tan of Tan Holdings Corporation, DeLay was quoted as saying: > When one of my closest and dearest friends, Jack Abramoff, your most able > representative in Washington, D.C., invited me to the islands, I wanted to > see firsthand the free-market success and the progress and reform you have > made.\\" An undercover investigation by ABC News captured Willie Tan speaking on a hidden camera about a conversation with DeLay about labor reform laws. According to Tan, \\"[DeLay] said, 'Willie, if they elect me majority whip, I make the schedule of the Congress, and I'm not going to put it on the schedule.' So Tom told me, 'Forget it, Willie. No chance.'\\" After the trip, Abramoff helped DeLay craft policy that extended exemptions from federal immigration and minimum-wage labor laws to Saipan industries, though the island is part of the U.S. Commonwealth. Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998 alleged that factories on Saipan have forced their workers to have abortions in order to keep their jobs. In addition, Abramoff's lobbying team helped Rep. Ralph Hall (R-TX) craft statements attacking the credibility of \\"Katrina,\\" a teenaged sex slave whom federal officials relocated to Hawaii and who testified to federal investigators and Congress about the sex trade on that island, in the process forestalling a federal criminal prosecution. Abramoff also negotiated a $1.2 million no-bid contract from the Marianas for 'promoting ethics in government' to be awarded to David Lapin, brother of Daniel Lapin. Abramoff also allegedly paid the expenses for at least two other trips to the Marianas. In both cases, Abramoff was reimbursed by Preston Gates & Ellis, which was then being paid by the Marianas government. The first trip involved two aides to Tom DeLay, Edwin A. Buckham and Tony Rudy, both who later joined the lobbying firm Alexander Strategy Group. Buckham and Rudy traveled with Abramoff from December 4 to December 12, 1996. Abramoff paid at least $3,000 of the costs, according to a memo written by his assistant Jennifer Senft Hamann. The second trip involved James E. Clyburn (D-SC) and Bennie Thompson (D-MS). In a letter dated December 17, 1996, the National Security Caucus Foundation invited the lawmakers to attend a trip to the island in January 1997, saying that the government would incur no expense. Non-profits are allowed to pay for lawmaker travel, and Clyburn and Thompson said they believed the NSCF was doing so. Greg Hilton, the director of the NSCF at the time, has said that Preston Gates & Ellis sent him the airline tickets and told him the government had paid for them. The cost of the trip was, according to an Abramoff memo, $15,657. The lawmakers said that they never met Abramoff nor knew of his involvement. Contract suspended and renewed Abramoff's lobbying contract with the CNMI was suspended in late 1998 due to a January change in administration and financial problems. In December 1999, allegedly at the request of CNMI politician Benigno R. Fitial, Edwin A. Buckham and Michael Scanlon visited the CNMI intending to convince two legislators to support Fitial for speaker of the CNMI's 18-member House of Representatives. Scanlon was still a member of Tom DeLay's congressional staff, and was on unpaid leave at the time. Buckham and Scanlon extended promises to help deliver federal aid to the legislators' districts, and succeeded in convincing the two Democratic legislators to vote for Fitial, a member of the rival Covenant Party. After Fitial was elected speaker in January 2000, he wrote the governor insisting that the islands contract again with Abramoff at Preston Gates & Ellis. In August 1999, Abramoff's firm, Greenberg Traurig (which, all told, received $4.04 million from 1998 to 2002 from the Commonwealth), hired Millennium Marketing (a division of the Ralph Reed-founded Century Strategies) to \\"sen[d] out a mailer to Alabama conservative Christians asking them to call then-Rep. Bob Riley (R-Ala.) and tell him to vote against legislation that would have made the CNMI subject to federal minimum wage laws. \\"The radical left, the Big Labor Union Bosses, and Bill Clinton want to pass a law preventing Chinese from coming to work on the Marianas Islands,\\" the mailer from Reed's firm said. The Chinese workers, it added, \\"are exposed to the teachings of Jesus Christ\\" while on the islands, and many \\"are converted to the Christian faith and return to China with Bibles in hand.\\" In February 1999, a congressional delegation visited the CNMI; it included Representative John Doolittle, who would get significantly more involved in 2001. Doolittle and Representative Joel Hefley write in June 1999, a \\"Dear Colleague\\" letter, saying that a May 1999 show on ABC's newsmagazine, 20/20, \\"The Shame of Saipan\\", had numerous inaccuracies, and that \\"Tom DeLay has consistently engaged government leaders in taking steps toward reform in the Mariana Islands to ensure and maintain a vibrant economy under local control.\\" By late July 2000, Abramoff and Preston Gates were hired again, for $100,000 a month. In January 2001 Abramoff switched lobbying firms to Greenberg Traurig. \\"'Our standing with the new administration promises to be solid as several friends of the CNMI (islands) will soon be taking high- ranking positions in the Administration, including within the Interior Department,' Abramoff wrote in a January 2001 letter in which he persuaded the island government to follow him as a client to his new lobbying firm, Greenberg Traurig.\\" In January 2006, CNMI Governor Benigno Fitial demanded that Preston Gates & Ellis and Greenberg Traurig return much of the money originally paid for lobbying services, claiming that \\"the positive benefits of those services have been undone by the wide scandal brought on by the criminal charges against Abramoff.\\" In August 2006, Roger Stillwell, formerly an employee of the Department of the Interior, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to report gifts received from Abramoff during the period that Abramoff was lobbying the Interior on behalf of the Commonwealth of the Marianas Islands. In April 2008, the US Senate campaign of Republican Bob Schaffer was rocked by reports of Schaffer's participation in a 1999 trip with his wife to the CNMI organized by Preston-Gates, and paid for by the Traditional Values Coalition. Schaffer later used his position on the House Resources Committee to attack reports of abuses on the islands.Michael Riley, \\"Schaffer, lobbyist strategies meshed\\", Denver Post; 4/12/2008.

An 1835 engraving by Barber showing the North Haven (Connecticut) Green Life John Warner Barber Barber was born in East Windsor, Connecticut, and learned his craft from the East Windsor printmaker Abner Reed. In 1823 he opened a business in New Haven, where he produced religious and historical books, illustrated with his own wood and steel engravings. He traveled around Connecticut, creating ink sketches of town greens, hotels, schools, churches, and harbors and collected local history as he went. He also delved into the works of historians. From all this he produced the book now commonly called Connecticut Historical Collections. The full title is Connecticut Historical Collections, Containing a General Collection of Interesting Facts, Traditions, Biographical Sketches, Anecdotes, Etc., Relating to the History and Antiquities of Every Town in Connecticut with Geographical Descriptions. The book has been called \\"the first popular local history published in the U.S.\\" The book sold well‚Äî7,000 copies in its first year even though it cost three dollars, then an average week's pay.

He then transferred the drawings directly to small blocks of boxwood on which he engraved the designs. \\"He talked with townspeople, gathered local documents and made quick sketches everywhere he went,\\" according to a New York Times article from December 10, 1989, quoted on a print-selling Web site. \\"The illustrations depict each town center, with its homes and churches, academies and courthouses sailboats plying a river or harbor, an occasional factory belching puffs of smoke and always a tiny figure or two, often the artist in his top hat, sketching the scene or pointing to the view.\\" He died in New Haven, Connecticut in June 1885.

It was developed by the German company SEK (Spieleentwicklungskombinat), based in Berlin. The game features more than 50 prehistoric animals, especially dinosaurs and Pleistocene mammals. The game uses TAGES, and therefore installs a driver on the system for copy protection. Gameplay The game-concept is similar to \\"Age of Empires\\", which is a real-time strategy game. ParaWorld features food, wood, and stone as resources. Food can be picked from bushes, hunted from animals, fished from the sea, or farmed. Stone is located in limited deposits, and wood, cut from trees, is generally scattered throughout a map. Battles can occur on both land and sea. The story takes place in a parallel dimension, where prehistoric life thrives alongside diverse human civilizations that are not technologically advanced. As a result, dinosaurs take the place of traditional wildlife and livestock, though some of the dinosaurs in-game are highly stylized and not necessarily scientifically accurate. Wild-living dinosaurs can be hunted for food, though some are of dangerous and aggressive species and will attack any player unit that wanders too close. Other prehistoric creatures make an appearance as well, for example woolly mammoths are used where other games might feature elephants. Players advance through epochs in order to unlock new technologies and upgrades. Plot summary ParaWorld (\\"parallel world\\") is an alternate universe where dinosaurs and ice age creatures never became extinct. A group of 19th-century scientists, the SEAS (the Society of Exact Alternative Science) led by scientific genius Jarvis Babbit, discovered the parallel world where dinosaurs and primitive human tribes coexist. When they subsequently learned that people don't age in this dimension and that the concept of electricity is inexistant, they decided to remain there to rule. Later, three young scientists are led to Jarvis Babbit: the American geologist Anthony Cole, Swedish biologist Stina Holmlund, and Hungarian physics genius B√©la Andr√°s Benedek, all of whom having discovered elements in the \\"real\\" world that point toward the existence of a parallel world. Jarvis Babbit decides to send the three scientists into \\"Paraworld\\", seemingly for an expedition. However, when the three heroes discover the true intentions of the SEAS, they have to rally all the parallel world's warring inhabitants in order to defeat the SEAS. The three scientists serve as the game's core \\"hero\\" units. Their main goal is to return to their home world, but to do this they will need to enlist the aid of enlightened natives and battle against the hostile creatures, tribes, and ultimately the masterminds trying to stop them. Along the way they'll meet several characters who are seemingly based on classical scientists such as Nicola Tesla or Charles Darwin (\\"Nikolaj Taslow\\" and \\"James Warden\\" in the game). They eventually discover that a man named David Leighton, who is one of Babbit's men, is orchestrating events on the parallel world, and pursue him. They also learn of a plot to permanently seal the world away by moving the planet out of orbit, which will also trigger a cataclysm. In order to save the planet and secure their own escape from ParaWorld, they are forced to assault Babbit's fortifications. They manage to stop the countdown and Cole kills Leighton in battle. Babbit makes a last-ditch effort to stop the heroes by using a giant robot. Having failed, Babbit falls into lava and presumably dies. The heroes finally go back home. However, Cole is awakened in the middle of the night by a phone call of B√©la telling him that the dinosaurs have come through as well. The chaos of ParaWorld now ensues on planet Earth. Reception Upon release the game was met with fair reviews with an average critic score of 72% at GameRankings. The developing company SEK shut down due to insufficient sales, and Sunflowers ended their partnership with it. The previously announced expansion pack was cancelled. A German-only Booster Pack for the game was released with Gold GOTY Editions of Paraworld, containing new maps, heroes, and missions, and was only compatible with German copies of the game. However, members of the ParaWorld gaming community \\"Para-Welt\\" have created an unofficial downloadable version of the Booster Pack for all regions that incorporates updated community content (such as modifications enabling players to utilise the previously NPC 'SEAS' factions) alongside the official SEK Booster Pack content. According to German newspaper Die Welt, ParaWorld was commercially unsuccessful, with sales of around 100,000 units.https://web.archive.org/web/20181210201501/https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/webwelt/article710868/Dinosaurier- bringen-PC-Spielestudio-zu-Fall.html References External links *Official website Category:2006 video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Dinosaurs in video games Category:Video games featuring parallel universes ","title":"ParaWorld"},{"id":"6640844","text":"Eager Beaver Baseball Association, Inc.

Overview In the spring of 1979, nearly five months following the negative reception of her first venture in a variety show entitled Mary which CBS pulled from its schedule after only three broadcasts, Mary Tyler Moore returned to CBS with this new short-lived series; it was part situation comedy and part variety show, using a show-within-a-show format that centered on the problems encountered in putting a variety series together. Moore stars as Mary McKinnon, the host of a fictional weekly variety series called The Mary McKinnon Show. McKinnon is a well-established star of comedy who could also sing and dance. Also seen were her long time personal secretary-companion Iris Chapman (Joyce Van Patten), her writer-director Artie Miller (Ron Rifkin), her producer Harry Sinclair (Michael Lombard), her studio page Kenneth Christy (Michael Keaton), her housekeepers Ruby (Dody Goodman) and Crystal (Doris Roberts), and her head writer Mort Zimmick (Bobby Ramsen). In addition to these regulars, major stars appeared as themselves in the guise of being guest stars on the fictional McKinnon program. Some of these included Lucille Ball, Beatrice Arthur, Nancy Walker, Linda Lavin, Bonnie Franklin, Ken Howard, Mike Douglas, Gene Kelly, Hal Linden, Johnny Mathis, Paul Williams and Dick Van Dyke.

Episodes Reception The show's premise was to give the audience a fictionalized view into the life of the star of a television variety show, much as The Jack Benny Show had purported to do two decades earlier on the same network. Unlike the Benny show, or Moore's sitcoms, but more like her earlier variety show the previous fall, The Mary Tyler Moore Hour would have trouble attracting a sizable audience. It ranked 54th out of 114 shows that season with an average 17.0/29 rating/share.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/79-OCR/BC-1979-06-18-OCR- Page-0056.pdf#search=%22rounding%20up%20the%20ratings%22 The Mary Tyler Moore Hour premiered on March 4 and was cancelled after its June 10 broadcast and 11 episodes. Moore announced plans to return in a new sitcom in the fall of 1980, but instead turned to Broadway, where she starred in a revival of Whose Life Is It Anyway? (winning a special 1980 Tony Award for her performance of a role originally played by Tom Conti), and then went back to Hollywood, where she played the emotionally crippled mother in the acclaimed film Ordinary People, directed by Robert Redford, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Moore did not return to series television and the sitcom format until the fall of 1985, with a sitcom entitled Mary.

A CB radio broadcast on channel 19, the most commonly used commercial trucking frequency, loops a warning about this turn and its hazards 24 hours a day, seven days a week. History Northern entrance to the tunnel During a period between January 2001 and May 2003, the tunnel was notorious for many truck accidents in the tunnel. The two main reasons for this were: * Truck drivers were not obeying the warning signs at the beginning of the tubes. * There was a sharp curve near and in the tunnel. In May 2003, the Ohio Department of Transportation installed radar speed signs at the ends of the tunnel that would show the posted speed for trucks along with the actual speed of the vehicle.

Based on the life of Attila the Hun, it stars Anthony Quinn as Attila and Sophia Loren as Honoria, with Henri Vidal, Irene Papas, Ettore Manni and Christian Marquand. Scott Marlowe (1932‚Äì2001) made his screen debut in the film. Along with The Pride and the Passion and Houseboat, it was one of Loren's biggest box-office successes during the 1950s. Filmed immediately following the breakthrough Italian-American co-production, Ulysses (Lux Films/Ponti- DeLaurentiis/Paramount Pictures, 1954), Attila, Scourge of God represented an independent attempt by the same Italian producers to make a film with an American lead actor in hopes of licensing it to an American studio for distribution on more lucrative terms. It failed to secure this goal for a variety of reasons unforeseen at the outset. However, three and a half years later (retitled, Attila) it proved to be the vehicle which launched the career of Joe Levine (Joseph E. Levine presents) as a producer and presenter of international films, many of them Italian in origin. While never to be a financially or critically acclaimed motion picture, Attila ultimately achieved the status of a significant product in the evolution of world film markets. Plot The story is set in 450 A.D. The Huns, a horde of barbarians from the distant plains of Asia, move toward the rich western lands of Germania, led by a savage chief, Attila. Flavius Aetius, a Roman general, is the only person who knows Attila since he was a hostage with the Huns for years. Aetius and his companion Prisco carry a message from the Roman emperor Valentinian III to the Hun's king Rua. After reaching their palace, Aetius learns that the king died, and that two brothers Bleda and Attila are now ruling the Hun kingdom. Bleda favours peace and tolerance, but Attila is at odds with him, and tensions develop. Yet Aetius knows to make an alliance between the Western Roman Empire and the Huns. Aetius returns to the Imperial court at Ravenna, where the childish emperor Valentinian III is busy with Roman parties in his palace and enjoying himself, while ignoring the fact that the Empire is beginning to fall apart. Because of this, his mother Galla Placidia is ruling the Empire. Honoria, daughter of Galla Placidia and sister of Valentinian, hopes to get rid of them, but needs help to do so. She asks Aetius to join her in a coup d'√©tat, but he has vowed an oath to serve the Empire and refuses, even if he's arrested and stripped of his military rank by Valantinian and Galla Placidia due to his alliance to the Huns. The two brothers battle, Attila wins by ordering his bodyguard to fire arrows at Bleda and his bodyguard during the hunt, and declares himself the sole leader of the Huns, riling them to support his aspirations of conquering the Roman Empire. Flavius Aetius returns to Ravenna, and finds Emperior Valentinian enraged by imagined attempts against his rule. Galla Placidia realizes that the Empire is now on the edge of destruction and gives Aetius full military power in an effort to protect her son. As a Roman field army marches to block Attila's path, Honoria slips away from the Imperial court and visits the Hun in his camp. The battle is eventually joined with a frontal attack on the Roman encampment by Hunnic cavalry. This first move is a deception, designed to draw the legions out of their fortified position. Aetius decides to pursue the retreating Huns, anyway. His cavalry charges and his foot soldiers follow them into the fray. After a clash of arms on the open plains, the fighting moves into the Hun camp. Here Honoria is found hiding in a nomad cart and killed. But Aetius is soon killed by an arrow through the neck and the Romans lose their will to fight. They flee the field and the Huns follow to burn their encampment. As night falls, Attila takes his young son, Bleda, to view the carnage strewn battlefield. There, a badly wounded Roman archer manages to fire a last shot. The arrow misses Attila, but kills Bleda. This emotionally traumatizes the Hun. He appears to lose his passion for conquest and plunder. On the way toward Rome, a sullen Attila and his horde come upon a procession of Christians led by Pope Leo I. Bewildered by the assembly he faces, Attila speaks alone with the Pope in the middle of a stream that separates his army from the religious gathering. Leo calmly tells Attila, \\"You can kill everybody...old people, women, children...\\" and Attila suddenly hears the disembodied words of his murdered brother Bleda. \\"Innocent blood won't be washed away. It will come back to haunt you.\\" With this warning in mind, Attila suddenly decides to turn back towards the Alps, leaving Rome unscathed.

US release (1958): The dawn of saturation booking  Joseph E. Levine, Embassy Pictures, 1958 Attilas release was a signal moment in US film distribution. It established an exhibition pattern which came to be known as \\"saturation booking\\". Joseph E. Levine, previously a US states-rights distributor/exhibitor based in Boston, quickly moved some 90 prints through regional distribution hubs, managing to assemble ad hoc arrays of mostly low- end theaters, where he could book short period playdates with favorable box- office terms. This dense concentration of venues allowed for the cost effective use of local TV and radio spots, and he spent far more than most would have considered prudent. Following this pattern, Levine was able to generate over $2 million in US box-office rentals with only a ten-day-per- screen exhibition average. The success of Attila proved that an exploitable picture with heavy TV-advertising, and a dense concentration of theaters, could break through traditional road blocks to success for an independent release. The results Levine achieved were then intensified (utilizing Warner Bros' nationwide network of print exchanges) in realizing the far greater take ($4.7 million, North American rentals) for his promotional blockbuster, Hercules, released the following summer with over 600 prints (175 of these played simultaneously in the Greater New York City area, at a time when studio releases often opened, nationally, with such a number). Warner Bros. was so impressed with the exhibition showmanship and business acumen that Joe Levine had brought to Attila, they paid him a $300,000. advance to secure the distribution rights to Hercules. Levine licensed the US theatrical, non- theatrical, and television exhibition rights to Attila for a 10-year term (through March 1968) for $90,000, plus the cost of supplied film and sound mastering elements from Lux Films/Ponti-DeLaurentiis. He also remade the picture's main title and head credits in English, typesetting them over a simple weaved-cloth background. In all, about $110,000. was expended to get the film ready for printing. In the course of its initial release, Levine also spent $590,000 on print and newspaper advertising, and $350,000 on radio and TV spots, enabling the picture to earn back over $2 million in US rentals. It was re-released in 1961 on a double-bill with Steve Reeves' Hercules, then sold into TV-syndication. By contract, all US 35mm and 16mm, prints and masters, were collected and disposed of in 1968. The film was then out of US distribution for decades. The picture's 1958 US copyright was renewed in 1986, by a Parisian law firm believed to be acting on behalf of Carlo Ponti and the French StudioCanal film library. An Italian-language version (with English sub-titles) was finally issued to US home video in 2008 as part of a 4-film collection from Lionsgate which contained some of Sophia Loren's earlier works. Since the movie's initial release, English-language versions have featured a track dubbed by Anthony Quinn. This track was also used on Joe Levine's American distribution prints and contains many lines in English which do not match the dialogue spoken in Italian.

The company was founded in 1962 by Giuliano Malservisi and Gian Pietro Parmeggiani to produce accurate scale model kits with attention to detail. History  The company was founded in 1962 by Giuliano Malservisi and Gian Pietro Parmeggiani. Since childhood, they had loved airplanes and military vehicles, but were not satisfied enough with the scale models on the market available at those times. They began to produce models themselves, first as a hobby, and later turning it into a business. The first name of the company was \\"Italstamp\\" and the first scale model kit was released with the brand \\"Aliplast\\", a 1:72 model of the Italian fighter Fiat G.55. The company name changed to \\"Italaerei\\" and, ten years later, it was contracted into \\"Italeri\\", easier to use and to pronounce not only in Italian language. The logo consists of an airplane silhouetted over two red and green stripes. The company, located close to Bologna, started to produce product lines characterized by a certain ‚Äúuniqueness‚Äù on the subjects. In particular Italeri used to have a wide range of Italian subjects. During its lifetime Italeri has also acquired the Supermodel and Protar brands.  Product range  Italeri has a wide portfolio of scale models. It has designed famous Italian aircraft used by the Regia Aeronautica during the Second World War, from the small biplane fighter Fiat CR.42 to Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 three-engine bomber. Italeri has also produced, in 1:72 scale, the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, nicknamed \\"gobbo maledetto‚Äù, which translates as \\"the cursed hunchback\\". Italeri also put great attention to WWII Italian Army military vehicles such as AB armored cars series, the small L6 recon tank, and the rare (produced in few numbers) P-40 heavy tank. They have also produced a series of 1:35 scale motor torpedo boats of World War II such as the American PT-596, the metre-long model of the Schnellboot S-100 of the German Kriegsmarine, and the MAS of the Italian Regia Marina. The small assault boats 1:35 series also includes the Italian Barchino and Maiale and the German Biber. Italeri also produces of 1:24 scale model trucks, trailers and semi-trailers. In recent years, Italeri introduced the Photographic Reference Manual (PRM) for some kits, in which the subject of the scale model kit is described with a high level of historical information and modelling details. The first kit to be accompanied by the PRM was the U.S. Navy patrol torpedo boat.

It is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group still alive for a given period of time after diagnosis. It is a method of describing prognosis in certain disease conditions. Survival rate can be used as yardstick for the assessment of standards of therapy. The survival period is usually reckoned from date of diagnosis or start of treatment. Survival rates are important for prognosis, but because the rate is based on the population as a whole, an individual prognosis may be different depending on newer treatments since the last statistical analysis as well as the overall general health of the patient. There are various types of survival rates (discussed below). They often serve as endpoints of clinical trials and should not be confused with mortality rates, a population metric. Overall survival Patients with a certain disease (for example, colorectal cancer) can die directly from that disease or from an unrelated cause (for example, a car accident). When the precise cause of death is not specified, this is called the overall survival rate or observed survival rate. Doctors often use mean overall survival rates to estimate the patient's prognosis. This is often expressed over standard time periods, like one, five, and ten years. For example, prostate cancer has a much higher one-year overall survival rate than pancreatic cancer, and thus has a better prognosis. Sometimes the overall survival is reported as a death rate (%) without specifying the period the % applies to (possibly one year) or the period it is averaged over (possibly 5 years), e.g. Obinutuzumab: A Novel Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Net survival rate When someone is interested in how survival is affected by the disease, there is also the net survival rate, which filters out the effect of mortality from other causes than the disease. The two main ways to calculate net survival are relative survival and cause-specific survival or disease-specific survival. Relative survival has the advantage that it does not depend on accuracy of the reported cause of death; cause specific survival has the advantage that it does not depend on the ability to find a similar population of people without the disease. =Relative survival= Relative survival is calculated by dividing the overall survival after diagnosis of a disease by the survival as observed in a similar population that was not diagnosed with that disease. A similar population is composed of individuals with at least age and gender similar to those diagnosed with the disease. =Cause-specific survival and disease-specific survival= Disease-specific survival rate refers to \\"the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who have not died from a specific disease in a defined period of time. The time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than the disease being studied are not counted in this measurement.\\" Definition : disease- specific survival rate Median survival Median survival, or \\"median overall survival\\" is also commonly used to express survival rates. This is the amount of time after which 50% of the patients have died and 50% have survived. In ongoing settings such as clinical trials, the median has the advantage that it can be calculated once 50% of subjects have reached the clinical endpoint of the trial, whereas calculation of an arithmetical mean can only be done after all subjects have reached the endpoint. Five-year survival Five-year survival rate measures survival at 5 years after diagnosis. Disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and metastasis-free survival In cancer research, various types of survival rate can be relevant, depending on the cancer type and stage. These include the disease-free survival (DFS) (the period after curative treatment [disease eliminated] when no disease can be detected), the progression-free survival (PFS) (the period after treatment when disease [which could not be eliminated] remains stable, that is, does not progress), and the metastasis-free survival (MFS) or distant metastasis‚Äìfree survival (DMFS) (the period until metastasis is detected). Progression can be categorized as local progression, regional progression, locoregional progression, and metastatic progression.

Based in Shizuoka, Japan, Hasegawa competes against its neighbor, Tamiya, though it does not have as large a line of products. Description Primarily using polystyrene, Hasegawa kits are typically regarded as very accurate, but without quite the ease-of-assembly that Tamiya kits offer, though of very high standard nonetheless. Currently, Hasegawa kits are imported into North America by Hobbico's Great Planes Model Distributor division. Hasegawa ended their long-time agreement with Dragon Models Limited for US distribution in early 2010. Hasegawa also imports Revell kits into Japan and sells them under both the Revell brand and its own brand label, and Revell frequently re-boxes Hasegawa kits for the European and North American markets. Lacking their own lineup of paint products, Hasegawa kits come with instructions that specify the use of Gunze Sangyo products, most notably paints in the GSI Creos brand. This is in contrast to Tamiya, who specifies the use of its in-house brands. Hasegawa is noted for releasing a large number of minor variations of their major products, often adding or modifying a small number of parts, or only changing the decals for the kit. This strategy allows them to maximize their return on their investment in kit tooling quicker, as such minor variations cost little to produce compared to the cost of manufacturing the original. Most such variations are usually only released once. History In 1941, the Hasegawa factory opened as a manufacturer of wooden teaching materials, such as a woodwork models. It entered into the plastic model field in 1961, with its first plastic model \\"glider\\" airplane models. In the following June 1962, the \\"1/450 battleship Yamato\\" was released after high development costs and became a success with about 150,000 units sold in the same year, and continuing success in the following years. The profitable line of 1/90 F-104 Starfighter and 1/70 P-51 Mustang model kits became the turning point which prompted Hasegawa to turn away from woodwork models and to plastic models completely. Product Lines =1/12 Scale Automobiles= Hasegawa produced kits of at least two cars in this large scale: the Nissan 300ZX and the Mazda RX-7. =1/8 Scale Aircraft (Museum Series)= Since the mid-70's, Hasegawa has produced four kits in this series, museum quality skeleton models of early 20th century aircraft. The kits, of exceptional quality, use a variety of woods, metals, brass, plastic, rubber, and other materials. The kit issued are of the following aircraft: the Fokker Dr.I the Sopwith Camel the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 the Wright Flyer (1/16 scale). With the initial Fokker DR.I harking back to Hasegawa's wooden kit days (see above), the kit has a wooden structure augmented by cast brass and molded plastic components. the kit was first introduced in the 1970s,Air International magazine, section Model Enthusiast, June 1975 and has seen sporadic re-issue since then. The 1/8 Museum Series kits are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts, commanding high prices when sold as retail items, or when auctioned online. In 2013 and 2014, Hasegawa has also released selected sub-assemblies from these kits as stand-alone models. Examples include the Rotary engines from the Fokker Dr.I and Sopwith Camel, and the Spandau and Lewis machine guns from these kits respectively. =1/24 Scale Automobiles= Hasegawa has found success in producing kits of subjects that were somewhat ignored by the larger model manufacturers. The quality of these kits can vary from very simple construction with few details, to those with very high fidelity, rivaling Tamiya or Revell's best efforts. Many kits include photo-etched parts, and some have been released as \\"Super Detail\\" versions, featuring additional photo-etched and white metal parts. Hasegawa's automotive selection is made up of several categories, including: Collection Disk featuring Mitsubishi Galants and Lancers, Subaru Legacys and Impreza WRXs, Honda Civics Collection Rally featuring a wide selection of rally cars, spanning from the 1970s, such as the Lancia Stratos and Lancia 037 Rally, to modern World Rally Championship competitors, like the Subaru Impreza, Lancia Delta HF Integrale, and Ford Focus. Collection Speed features various touring car race cars that competed in the Japanese Touring Car Championship in the mid-1990s, including Honda Civics, Toyota Corollas and BMW 3 Series in various liveries. Historic Car featuring sports cars from the 1970s and older, including the Toyota 2000GT and Celica 1600GT, various versions of the Nissan Fairlady 240Z and Bluebird 510 (the latter in four-door sedan form, unusual for a plastic model car, as it was the most widely exported version of the 1:1), the Lamborghini Miura, as well as various kits of the Volkswagen Beetle and Microbus. Historic Racing featuring winning cars from their respective events. Many of these are race versions of cars available in the Historic Car line. Examples include Toyota 2000GT \\"1967 Fuji 24 Hour Race Winner,\\" Nissan Bluebird 1600 SSS \\"1970 Safari Rally Winner\\" and Datsun Fairlady 240Z \\"1971 Safari Rally Winner.\\" Military Vehicle featuring versions of the Willys MB Jeep and the Volkswagen K√ºbelwagen. Racing Car features various Group C race cars, including versions of the Jaguar XJR-8LM, the Porsche 962, the Sauber Mercedes C9 and the Toyota 88C, as well as various Formula 1 cars including the Ferrari 642, Benetton Ford B191B, and Williams Renault FW14B. World Famous Car featuring various versions of the Jaguar XJ-S V12, the Ferrari 328 and 348 and the Porsche 944 and 968. =1/32 Scale Aircraft= Considered among the best in this scale as well, these kits depict mainly World War II fighter aircraft, with a few modern jets and a few oddities such as the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch military liaison plane. Notably, the Mitsubishi Zero A6M5 model was created under the supervision of Jiro Horikoshi, designer of the actual craft. =1/48 Scale Aircraft= Hasegawa was a latecomer to the field of 1/48 scale aircraft, and its efforts may be seen as a response to Tamiya's strong presence through the 1970s and 1980s. The line consists of World War II and modern military aircraft, mostly fighters. In the 1980s a small line of 1/48 business jets was produced, but was discontinued. =1/72 Scale Aircraft= This has traditionally been Hasegawa's main product line, and that which the company is best known for. It consists almost entirely of World War II and modern military aircraft, primarily fighter and attack aircraft, with some larger bombers and multi-engined examples. At times the line has included kits manufactured by Frog and Monogram, as well as other minor specialty brands. Hasegawa, like many of its competitors, produces a nearly complete lineup of Imperial Japanese Air Force and Navy types from World War II. Notably, the company's product line includes every variant of the Mitsubishi A6M Reisen Zero fighter. Among modern types, the company specialises in types found in the JASDF, to cater for local Japanese modellers. Hasegawa's kits of modern military aircraft are often considered by hobbyists the definitive kit of given types. Unlike most of its competitor's, Hasegawa's modern military aircraft are packaged with minimal weaponry. Hasegawa produce a number of aircraft weapon sets which must be purchased separately. Hasegawa often releases limited-run kits in this line (as well as 1/48) which feature special decal sets, often for timely subjects; examples include the Navy One S-3 Viking, and the F-4 Phantom, F-15J Eagle and F-2A Viper Zero kits representing the winners of the JASDF's annual gunnery competitions. Sometimes these reissues are of models that have been long discontinued, or include two kits in a single box. As such releases are aimed at connoisseur modelers, they are usually priced twice or even more as much as the corresponding standard kit. Included in its selection are Science Fiction types, specifically of the Macross series Valkyrie transformable fighters, which are modelled in their jet-fighter forms (see below) =1/72 Scale Armor= Also called the \\"Minibox\\" series, this features military vehicles (mostly World War II, with a few modern) designed to be compatible with the 1/72 aircraft. The series was released in the 1970s, and are still being produced today. =1/150 Scale Trolleys= Hasegawa sells ready-to-run model trolleys under the Modemo brand in 1:150 scale, of both Japanese and American prototypes. =1/200 Scale Aircraft= This line consists of airliners. The kits are somewhat simplified but go together well. They are known for their quality and ease of build. At the moment, Hasegawa is the only major manufacturer of 1/200 scale airliner model kits, with it being a common scale for ready built, snap-fit or diecast models. Hasegawa currently produces 1/200 models of the Boeing 747-200,787-8, 747-400, 777-200, 777-300, 767-300, 737-200, 737-500, 737-700, 737-800 and 727-200, as well as the McDonnell Douglas MD-90, MD-11, DC-10-40, DC-3, Lockheed L-1011, and Airbus A300. Models such as the Boeing 737-400, 747-100, 747-300, 767-200, McDonnell Douglas MD-80, DC-9, DC-10-30, Airbus A320, A321 have been made in the past. Although Hasewaga has been licensed by international airline companies in the past, as of 2019, the brand produces Japanese airlines' models only, such as All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and Vanilla Air model airplanes.http://www.hasegawa- model.co.jp/gsite/item_g/air200_g/ =1/350 Scale Ships= =1/700 Scale Waterline Ships= Image:Type VIIc.jpgHasegawa 1/700 scale Type VIIc U-Boat =Science Fiction Kits= Currently, this consists of spacecraft and mecha from the Macross and Ultraman television/film series, as well as subjects from the Virtual On video game franchise (especially Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Force and Marz Virtuaroids) and Maschinen Krieger universe. =Novelty Items= Though definitely not \\"true scale\\" models, Hasegawa also produces a line of small aircraft called Egg Planes. On the box they are described as \\"grade-A jumbo scale\\". They feature an egg-shaped distorted interpretation of a real world aircraft, such as the P-51 mustang, SR-71 blackbird, and the Space Shuttle. The kits have a relatively low parts count and are designed to provide recreational enjoyment. These kits were first introduced in Easter 1972 (Air Enthusiast, section Model Enthusiast, April 1972), and their range was limited to the first three models discussed above. In the 1980s, 1990's and 2000's, Hasegawa has increased the range to mirror successful models in their more formal scale model ranges in 1:72. Subjects today include a wider range of World War II fighters, modern combat aircraft, helicopters, and even Macross Valkyries.

It is located in Putnam and Marshall Counties, Illinois. Its elevation is 439 feet (134 meters) above sea level. Senachwine Lake is connected by a shallow channel to adjacent Goose Lake, also a backwater lake of the Illinois River. Glacial relic The drainage, by sudden flood, of a sizable lake of glacial meltwater upon the conclusion of the Wisconsin glacial period left the lower Illinois River valley, including the Senachwine Lake area, as a broad ribbon of relatively impermeable clay and silt bordered by low bluffs. During the post-glacial springtimes, as the climate of Illinois grew warmer, floods caused by snowmelt tended to fill sections of the valley faster than it could be drained during the rest of the year. Eventually the Illinois River became a braided, slow-moving alluvial river bordered by a string of riverside lakes and wetlands. Senachwine Lake is one of these backwater lakes. Backwater lake and fish During prehistoric and early historic times, backwater lakes bordering the Illinois such as Senachwine Lake became highly productive areas for fishing. Native American sites such as Dickson Mounds pay tribute to the civilizations founded on fishing, waterfowling, and the gathering of wetland plants and animals. During early American frontier years, wetland zones were key areas in the fur trade. Commercial fishing in Lake Senachwine continued until 1900-1910, when toxic waste was injected into the Illinois River through the newly dug Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. Remediation Efforts to remediate Senachwine Lake have concentrated on mandates to clean up sewage discharges into the Illinois River drainage, and efforts to cut the erosion of Illinois topsoil into the lake and river. Adjacent areas of Putnam County are vulnerable to erosion, as they are heavily cultivated for corn and soybeans. Senachwine Lake is a local favorite for recreation, with a boat ramp located near Putnam, Illinois off Illinois Route 29. Fish-eating waterfowl, including egrets, great blue herons, and bald eagles, have returned to the lake.

It was a form of the fur trade, but less known, since deer skins were not as valuable as furs from the north (such as beaver). Colonial deerskin exports were an important source of raw material for the European markets. The Cherokee mainly traded their deer-skins to the English, and the Shawnee traded deer skins to both the French and English colonies prior to 1760. In the early 18th century, after King William's War, the beaver fur trade declined dramatically while the deerskin trade boomed. This was in part due to a shift in changing fashions in London, where a new kind of hat made from leather was becoming popular. This new hat required deerskin and colonial South Carolina increased the scale of its deerskin exports dramatically. Trade in other kinds of fur fell sharply. The end of a diversified fur trade altered the relationship between European colonists and Native Americans, in many cases caused an increase in tension and conflict. For example, it was an important factor in the events leading up to the Yamasee War. By 1750, deer were becoming harder to find in Cherokee territory. So large was the scale of the trade that in time deer became nearly extinct in the southeast. It also radically altered the social make-up of the Cherokee because the men were increasingly absent from towns (for long periods to hunt deer). Concurrently, Cherokee society was undergoing a growing dependence on European trade goods. These events contributed to growing tensions and conflict between the Indian tribes themselves, as well as with the Europeans. Deerskin was used to produce buckskin, as well as a chamois- like leather, used for the making of gloves, bookbinding, and many other things.

University Woods, formerly British Fort #8, has a two-tiered pathway and the original stone walls used by the British troops during the American Revolutionary War. The main stairs, now pending restoration, are a popular passageway between Cedar Avenue and Sedgwick Avenue and lead further up to the Hall of Fame terrace and Bronx Community College. Friends of the Woods is an organization founded by Brandy Cochrane in 2006 to rehabilitate and maintain the park. Formerly a real estate professional she was drawn to the park while assessing housing in the vicinity. Even though Cochrane had been a resident in the neighborhood for over four years, she was stunned to discover this idyllic hideaway just blocks from her home. Since that time, she has been a public supporter of not only the preservation of rural areas in her neighborhood, but of the value of community cohesiveness, inclusiveness, and assertive actions that can be taken to improve the quality of life in urban areas. Friends of The Woods received $500,000 from the city of New York and has set about to restore the infrastructure of University Woods. They have partnered with the Parks Department, The Harlem River Ecology Center, the New York State Horticultural Center, and many other ecologically conscious groups to make further improvements to this once abandoned woodland.

History It was announced in October 1983, FN were seeking to develop a more powerful replacement for the .50 BMG, better able to penetrate light armoured vehicles (in effect, a Western equivalent to the Soviet 14.5mm KPV heavy machine gun). FN initially selected the 20mm Hispano case as a basis and necked it down to 15mm for the FN-BRG (15x115). The weapon and its ammunition had a protracted development and finally emerged as a 15.5mm because of fast barrel wear. The 15.5x106 was FN's second effort to make a KPV competitor in the BRG-15, appropriately by necking out the KPV's case. It also utilized an unusual dual feed device, with link ammunition belts feeding from both the right and left. Spent shell casings were ejected out of the bottom of the gun, as in FN's later P90 personal defense weapon. The quick-change barrel assembly developed for the BRG-15 was redesigned for use in an updated version of the M2HB. The project was cancelled in the early 1990s, as FN shifted its focus to the P90 personal defense weapon. The subcaliber bullet fired from FN BRG-15 15.5mm round, with a muzzle energy of 40,000 J (more than double that of the M2HB at ‚âà18,000 J of bullet energy at muzzle).

The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 209 (US 209) in Millersburg. The eastern terminus is at US 209 in Newtown. PA 25 runs parallel to the Mahantongo Mountains and the Mahantango Valley, as well as US 209, for its entire length. The route passes through the communities of Berrysburg, Gratz, Sacramento, and Hegins. PA 25 intersects PA 225 in Berrysburg, PA 125 in Hegins, and Interstate 81 (I-81) in Frailey Township. PA 25 was designated in 1928 to run from US 209 in Millersburg east to PA 443 in Pine Grove, running east to Hegins before heading southeast to Tremont and south to Pine Grove. The road between Hegins and Newtown was designated as PA 125. PA 25 was realigned to head east from Hegins to Newtown in the 1930s, with the former alignment between Pine Grove and Hegins becoming a relocated PA 125. Route description PA 25 begins at an intersection with US 209 in the borough of Millersburg in Dauphin County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Johnson Street. The road passes homes and continues into Upper Paxton Township, becoming Berrysburg Road and heading into open agricultural areas with a few residences in the Lykens Valley, a rural valley that is home to an Amish community. The route runs through Killinger and continues through more rural areas, curving more to the east. PA 25 crosses into Mifflin Township and becomes an unnamed road, passing through Curtin and heading to the northeast. The road enters the borough of Berrysburg and becomes West Market Street, passing homes and coming to an intersection with PA 225. At this point, the route becomes East Market Street and runs past more residences before heading back into Mifflin Township and becoming an unnamed road that passes through open farmland. PA 25 continues into Lykens Township and runs through more rural areas with occasional homes. The road becomes the border between Lykens Township to the north and the borough of Gratz to the south as it becomes West Market Street and passes through agricultural areas with residential and commercial development, fully entering Gratz. The route continues past more homes along with some businesses, becoming a divided highway as it passes through the center of town and becomes East Market Street. PA 25 becomes an undivided road again and leaves the developed part of town for farmland with some homes and businesses. The road heads into Lykens Township again and becomes unnamed as it runs through agricultural areas with occasional woods and residences. PA 25 on Main Street in Hegins PA 25 crosses into Hubley Township in Schuylkill County and becomes West Main Street, continuing through areas of farms with some woodland and homes. The road passes through the residential community of Spring Glen before becoming East Main Street and running through Sacramento. The route continues into Hegins Township and becomes West Main Street, heading into the community of Valley View, where it passes several homes along with a few businesses. PA 25 runs through rural areas of residences and becomes East Main Street, passing to the north of Tri-Valley Junior/Senior High School, before heading past more homes in the community of Hegins and coming to a junction with PA 125. The road leaves the community and enters open farmland with a few homes, reaching Fountain. Past here, the route heads into forested areas and begins to cross Broad Mountain, heading northeast. PA 25 curves to the southeast and heads into Frailey Township, reaching an interchange with I-81. From here, the route turns east and heads into Reilly Township, with the name of the road becoming West Pine Street. PA 25 curves to the southeast and crosses Swatara Road before coming to its eastern terminus at another intersection with US 209 in Newtown. History When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 25 was not given a number. At this time, the highway existed as an unpaved road between Millersburg and Sacramento. PA 25 was designated in 1928 to run from US 209 in Millersburg east to PA 443 in Pine Grove, following its current alignment to Hegins before it turned southeast to Tremont and south to Pine Grove. At this time, a section of road west of Gratz, between the Dauphin/Schuylkill county line and Hegins, and a short stretch to the north of Pine Grove was paved while a short stretch east of Millersburg was under construction. In 1928, the road between Hegins and Newtown was designated as PA 125, which was unpaved. By 1930, PA 25 was paved between Millersburg and Killinger, between Berrysburg and west of Gratz, and a short distance to the south of Hegins while the road between Killinger and Curtin was under construction. In the 1930s, PA 25 was realigned at Hegins to head east to US 209 in Newtown, replacing PA 125. Meanwhile, the former stretch of PA 25 between Pine Grove and Hegins became part of a realigned PA 125. At this time, the entire length of PA 25 was paved.

It stars Kalyan Ram, Sindhu Tolani, and Ashish Vidyarthi in the lead roles, with the music composed by Mani Sharma. The film was released theatrically on 7 May 2005. Following its commercial success, the film was remade in Tamil as Aathi and in Kannada as Lakshmana. It was also dubbed in Hindi as International Don.  Plot  The opening scene shows Anjali (Sindhu Tolani) sitting on a bench feeding a white pigeon by a calm ocean, and a retired DGP Shankar (Ahuti Prasad) coming and sitting by her side and exchanging pleasantries. Suddenly, she whips out a knife and stabs him to death with the help of her maternal uncle Ramachandran (Surya), saying that she has been waiting for this moment for many years. After that, the scene shifts to Ram (Nandamuri Kalyan Ram) who lives with his loving parents (Chandra Mohan and Rajya Lakshmi) and sister (Sudeepa Pinky) in New Delhi. He takes up a course in a Hyderabad college against his parents' wishes. Unable to be separated from Ram, his parents and sister come to Hyderabad along with him. It is revealed that Anjali is studying in the same college as Ram, and she has her own agenda to seek revenge on her family's killers, assisted by Ramachandran. Now the villain Anna (Ashish Vidyarthi), a local gangster, enters and is shown to have a dispute with another person Pattabhai (Rami Reddy). To exact their revenge, Ramachandran attempts to kill one of Anna's aides, Abdullah (Raghu Babu), but fails to do so since Ram kills him. Naturally, Anna assumes that the killer can be none other than Pattabhai, so he kills him. However, Ram arrives on the scene, and with help from Gulab Singh (Venu Madhav), he threatens Anna telling that he was the one who killed Abdullah and that he will also kill Sada (G. V. Sudhakar Naidu), Anna's second main aide. As typical, Sada gets angry and goes to kill Ram but fails, and Ram kills Abdullah while his parents are watching with horror. On being questioned, Ram tells his story. Ram's biological father (Prakash Raj) was an honest cop who arrested one of Anna's henchmen. It is revealed that Anjali and Ram are from the same family, as Anjali's father is Ram's father's brother-in- law. Anna pays Ram's house a visit and asks his grandfather (Chalapati Rao) to let his henchmen go. When Ram's grandfather refuses, Anna threatens them only to find knives held at him by Ram and his cousins. Ram's father arrives and arrests Anna. Infuriated, he pays them a visit with some of his henchmen and Shankar. Together, they murder their whole extended family. Only Anjali, Ramachandran, and Ram survived the blast that annihilated their family. After the house is blown up by Anna, Ram escapes and is taken in by his foster parents. Meanwhile, Anjali feels that one of her family members is still alive, as someone keeps a flower on the Buddha statue of their former house, which is now the city library. It turns out to be none other than Ram. On finding out his past, Ram's foster parents request him to come back, but he refuses. He then takes them to the railway station, but is nearly ambushed. He succeeds on defeating them and meets Anna, warning him to bring his brother (Ajay) from Dubai. Soon, he arrives and kills Ramachandran in revenge before challenging Ram to meet him at his brother's place. Ram comes, and after finding out that Anna had Anjali kidnapped, escapes after killing Ajay. In a thrilling climax, Ram kills Anna, and is shown to be leaving with Anjali, the only one left in his family.

Work Garn produced a large body of work on many areas of human biology, beginning with human hair and eventually contributing research on determinants of coronary artery disease, somatotype, human races, dental development, skeletal development, nutrition, obesity and bone mineralization, among other subjects. In relation to his study on obesity, he studied over-nutrition and under-nutrition, human fat over the course of the human life cycle and the correlation between growth rate in infants and later fatness. He concluded that genetics forms a major component in determining a person's tendency for obesity, but socioeconomic factors are also significant. Based on his study on age and cholesterol, he concluded that people between the ages of thirty and fifty have their serum cholesterol rise which contributes to an increase risk for coronary artery disease.Menard M. Gertler M.D., Stanley Marion Garn M.D., E. F. Bland M.D. American Heart Association. Age, Serum Cholesterol and Coronary Artery Disease. 1950. August 23, 2006. . In relation to bone, he studied skeletal development, bone mineral loss, odontogenesis and dysmorphogenesis. His hypothesis was that dietary differences contribute to bone loss among individuals. Garn died of complications from peripheral vascular disease on August 31, 2007, in Ann Arbor Michigan. Race Garn remains a pivotal figure in the history of biological interpretations of race. He modernized older classifications of race, attempting to bring the race concept into line with ideas in population biology. Garn considered racial classification based on physical traits to be imprecise. He considered physical traits to be independent of each other, making classification by the assumption that a population shares certain traits incorrect. Furthermore, he was critical about racial classifications based on physical type which seemingly elevated some physical traits to a racial status, but glossed over others. He concluded that racial classifications based on physical type can always be compartmentalized into smaller populations which share more physical traits in common. He used three gradations of racial classification which were increasingly more specific in scope: geographical, local and micro.Garn, Stanley. Human Races. Charles Thomas. Springfield, IL. 1965. He counted thirty-four local races in the world that had arisen from genetic isolation.

The western terminus of the route is at the West Virginia state line in Richhill Township, where PA 21 continues into West Virginia as West Virginia Route 891. The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 40 Business in Uniontown. The route is known as the Roy E. Furman Highway for most of its length. PA 21 serves Waynesburg and Masontown along the way. PA 21 was originally designated in 1927 between the West Virginia border and Uniontown, originally following an alignment further to the north between Carmichaels and Uniontown via New Salem. By 1950, the route was moved to its current alignment east of Carmichaels, with bypasses of Carmichaels and Masontown constructed by 1960. Route description Pennsylvania Route 21 enters Greene County in Richhill Township near the village of Polen. The highway winds its way through the hilly and sparsely populated area passing Ryerson Station State Park to the north. It continues to the northeast into Gray Township where it veers to the southeast toward the village of Rogersville in Center Township. Just before reaching Rogersville, Route 21 merges with Pennsylvania Route 18 near West Greene High School. Route 18 leaves Route 21 near West Waynesburg while Route 21 continues into the borough of Waynesburg. PA 21 traveling west across the old Masontown Bridge that was demolished in 2013. In Waynesburg, PA 21 is a one-way pair as High Street (west) and Greene Street (east). Both streets are two lanes in the borough. High Street is the arterial road through Waynesburg's business district. While in Waynesburg, it shares its route with U.S. Route 19. PA 21 leaves Waynesburg entering the census-designated place of Morrisville. PA 21 becomes a two-lane road with a shared left turn lane for less than a mile before US 19 leaves the route and PA 21 stays east, becoming a four lane divided highway. Interstate 79 exit 14 is PA 21 in Morrisville signed for PA 21 to Masontown and Waynesburg. PA 21 then leaves Morrisville in Jefferson Township. PA 21 travels east-southeast through the rest of rural Greene County. The road is mostly level and the countryside is mostly farmland. In Paisley, PA 21 intersects Pennsylvania Route 88, then becomes a four-lane divided highway until it crosses the Masontown Bridge over the Monongahela River. PA 21 enters Fayette County in the borough of Masontown. It bypasses Masontown to the north and merges with PA 166 (Main St.). After leaving Masontown, the southernmost point on the route, PA 21 becomes McClellandtown Road. It turns to the northeast entering German Township and leaving PA 166. Passing through McClellandtown, PA 21 traverses more densely populated western Fayette County entering South Union Township. The highway enters South Union Township in the village of Uledi. It intersects Dixon Boulevard before entering the city of Uniontown. It has an interchange with U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 119 near Cherry Tree Square. It passes the Uniontown Hospital before ending at US Route 40 Business (Main St.). History In 1911, what would become PA 21 was designated as part of Legislative Route 256 between the West Virginia border and Rogersville, Legislative Route 111 between Rogersville and Waynesburg, and Legislative Route 112 between Waynesburg and Uniontown. PA 21 was designated in 1927 to run from the West Virginia border east to US 40 in Uniontown. The route followed its current alignment to west of Carmichaels, where it headed east by way of Carmichaels and New Salem to Uniontown. The alignment utilized a ferry across the Monongahela River. By the time of its inception, PA 21 existed as a paved road between Wind Ridge and PA 121 east of Waynesburg, in the Carmichaels area, and from south of Republic to Uniontown. The remainder of PA 21 was paved by 1940. By 1950, PA 21 was rerouted to follow PA 88 between Carmichaels and Paisley, where it turned east and crossed the Monongahela River at Masontown and followed its current alignment to Uniontown. Bypasses of Carmichaels and Masontown were built by 1960. Also by this time, PA 21 was widened into a divided highway near the PA 88 intersection in Paisley, By 1970, a portion of PA 21 east of Waynesburg was converted to a divided highway. A new, four-lane Masontown Bridge over the Monongahela River was completed in 2015. It replaced the two-lane bridge built in 1925.

The Dodgers are a member club of the National League (NL) West division, and the Yankees are a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The rivalry between the Dodgers and Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National leagues. The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn while the Yankees played in the Bronx. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States. The regular season series is currently tied 8‚Äì8. Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings, the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a 3-game interleague series. Nevertheless, games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds. While in New York =A new team in town, new stadiums built, Subway Series established= At the dawn of the 20th century, the American League was in its infancy, and one of its charter franchises (which would eventually become the Yankees) was the original Baltimore Orioles. The league, however, recognized that it required a presence in New York City, the country's largest market, in order to survive. Hence, it moved the Orioles to New York, which was already the home of two National League franchises, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants. The new team was eventually called the New York Highlanders due to their home field being Hilltop Park from 1903‚Äì1912. After the Highlanders allowed the Giants to play at Hilltop Park when the latter's home stadium, the Polo Grounds, was undergoing reconstruction from a fire, the Giants invited the Highlanders to share the Polo Grounds with them. Since the Highlanders were no longer playing at higher elevations, they changed their name to the New York Yankees. The Dodgers also opened up their new field, Ebbets Field, in Brooklyn. Their opening game at the stadium was an exhibition game against the Highlanders on April 5, where future Yankee manager Casey Stengel had the game-winning hit for the Dodgers. The Highlanders would officially be called the Yankees later that year. In 1920, the Giants notified the Yankees that they would have to find a new stadium of their own for the 1921 season.http://sabr.org/bioproj/park/58d80eca The Giants rescinded that eviction notice and allowed the Yankees to stay until the end of the 1922 season, when the Giants renovated the Polo Grounds and increased seating capacity from 38,000 to 50,000. Before that however, the 1921 World Series between the Giants and Yankees became the first Subway Series, as match-ups between the Dodgers and the Giants were not referred to as Subway Series. After losing to the Giants in that World Series and again the following year, the Yankees moved across the Harlem River to the original Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, where they captured their first ever World Series from the Giants in 1923. =1941: First meeting between the Bronx Bombers and \\"Dem Bums\\"= The rivalry between the Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers began when the teams first met in the 1941 World Series. In Game 4, with the Yankees leading the series two games to one, the Dodgers led by one going to the top of the ninth inning and, with two outs, just barely missed getting the third out and wound up losing the game. With two outs, the Yankees' Tommy Henrich swung and missed with two strikes, but reached on a passed ball, as Dodger catcher Mickey Owen failed to hold on to the pitch. Henrich reached first base on the play. Owen recalled the incident: Joe DiMaggio followed Henrich's at bat with a single before Charlie Keller hit a double to drive in both Henrich and DiMaggio and give the Yankees a 5-4 lead. After Bill Dickey walked, he and Keller scored on a Joe Gordon double to make the final score 7-4. The next day, the Yankees clinched the first series match-up between the two teams in the start of what would become a long-lasting rivalry. =1947-53: \\"Wait 'til next year!\\"= Six years later, the 1947 World Series had a dramatic moment in Game 6. The Dodgers' Al Gionfriddo was placed in left field for defensive purposes and robbed Joe DiMaggio of a game-tying three-run home run. DiMaggio was visibly disgusted by the outcome of the play when rounding the bases in one of the few emotional displays of his career. The Dodgers won the game and forced a do-or- die Game 7, only to fall. Dazzling defensive plays would be seen again, this time by the Yankees in the 1952 contest, as Billy Martin came outside the camera coverage area to catch a pop-fly after Brooklyn had threatened to take the lead in Game 7. Martin would go on to be the hero once more in the 1953 series with a series record 12 hits, including the winning hit of the series- clinching game off of Clem Labine. Brooklyn signed Jackie Robinson to not only break the color line, but to bolster the lineup. Robinson, along with outfielder Duke Snider and pitcher Don Newcombe, sparked Brooklyn to four National League pennants between 1947 and 1953. Each and every time during this period, however, the World Series ended in heartbreak for the Dodgers and gave the Dodger fans their rallying cry: \\"Wait 'til next year!\\" During the 1953 World Series, long time Dodgers announcer Red Barber refused to man the broadcast booth due to a compensation dispute with Gillette. Barber jumped ship to the Yankees and joined Mel Allen to call the games for the Yankees. Struggling to find a replacement, the Dodgers gave the call to a 25-year-old named Vin Scully, the youngest man to ever call a World Series game for a major network. Scully would go on to continue as a Dodgers broadcaster for another six decades. =1955: \\"This IS next year!\\"= Finally, in the Dodgers reversed matters, prevailing over the Yankees in seven games to win their only World Series in Brooklyn. Thus came the slogan, This IS next year. =1956: A \\"perfect\\" rematch= Brooklyn fell short of repeating the next season, falling in seven games to the Yankees. That year's team suffered some ignominy in being on the losing end of Don Larsen's perfect game in Game 5, which was the first of only two no-hitters ever pitched in postseason play and the only in the history of the World Series. In both the 1955 and 1956 World Series, the home team won the first six games of the World Series, but lost Game 7. It would not be until when the home team won all seven games of a World Series. However, the Yankees would meet the unfortunate fate of being the first American League team to lose a World Series in which the home team won all seven games, in . The 1956 World Series would be the last Subway Series of the 1900s and the last to include one of the National League's charter franchises. Dodgers move to Los Angeles =1963: Los Angeles Dodgers win= After the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles for the 1958 season, it would take them two dominating pitchers (Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale), a speedy shortstop (Maury Wills) and a great outfielder (Tommy Davis) to spark them to a pennant in 1963. They swept the aging Yankees (consisting of Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Whitey Ford) in four straight games to win their second World Series since moving to Los Angeles, having won in , with the Bronx Bombers not taking a single lead against the powerful Los Angeles pitching staff and being limited to just four runs in the entire series, the very first meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship. Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully said that although the Dodgers won four World Series titles in 10 years, he said that this championship was the biggest of those four because \\"the ultimate was not only beating the Yankees but sweeping them in four\\", but said that \\"to New York fans it was still the old Brooklyn Dodgers and there was a lot of bitterness toward them.\\" World Series appearances in the 1970s and 1981 =1977: The Bronx is Burning= Mr. October: Reggie Jackson hit three home runs in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series against the Dodgers to win the series for the Yankees. After 14 years, sophomore manager Tommy Lasorda led a young Dodgers team to the 1977 World Series where they faced Billy Martin and the Yankees. The two managers were involved in a fist fight during the 1956 season while playing for the two teams they were now managing. The Yankees were coming off a controversy ridden season. Furious at their loss to The Big Red Machine in the 1976 World Series, owner George Steinbrenner had signed slugger Reggie Jackson to the team. Jackson immediately created friction in the clubhouse between himself and Bill Martin as well as captain Thurman Munson, the defending AL MVP. New York City itself was going through a financial crisis under Mayor Abraham Beame and experienced the Son of Sam and a major blackout, all chronicled in The Bronx is Burning. Despite the controversy, the Yankees managed to play together and win the pennant to face the Dodgers in the World Series. The Dodgers featured an infield of Steve Garvey at first, Davey Lopes at second, Ron Cey at third, and Bill Russell at shortstop, in addition to slugger Reggie Smith, and pitching duo (Don Sutton and Tommy John). In addition to Jackson and Munson, the Yankees had Bucky Dent and Graig Nettles, Cy Young Award-winning closer Sparky Lyle, young pitcher Ron Guidry, and speedsters Willie Randolph and Mickey Rivers. The Dodgers appeared primed to win the Series, but Reggie Jackson put on his \\"Mr. October\\" show as he hit three home runs in Game 6 off of 3 pitches to lead the Yanks to their first World Series championship since . =1978: Bucky Dent's Playoffs= The next season, the Yankees won their division in thrilling fashion, thanks in large part to a timely home run from Bucky Dent in a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox. They went to the World Series for the third straight year where they faced the Dodgers for the second straight year. The Dodgers won the first two games of the Series thanks to rookie pitcher Bob Welch, but New York won the next four to take the 75th Fall Classic. =1981: Changing of the Guard= In , the fortunes turned in LA's favor, as rookie pitcher Fernando Valenzuela won National League Rookie of the Year and Cy Young Award honors. But the Yankees had American League Rookie of the Year Dave Righetti (who was traded from the Rangers in exchange for Lyle) and daunting 1-2 relief punch of set-up man Ron Davis and closer Rich Gossage. The Yankees won the first two contests, but LA, led by Valenzuela and first baseman Steve Garvey, won the next four to claim their first World Series title since in a strike-shortened season. Fallout from the series would eventually have Reggie Jackson be controversially dismissed a bit later and owner George Steinbrenner to start a public feud with Dave Winfield, who had a dismal performance in the series. After the series ended, Steinbrenner issued a public apology to the City of New York for his team's performance, while at the same time assuring the fans that plans to put the team together for 1982 would begin immediately. The Yankee owner was criticized heartily by players and press alike for doing so, as most people felt losing in the World Series was not something that needed to be apologized for. Lasorda said of the revenge for what Jackson did to the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978: \\"We were suffering and the guy was making a fool out of us. I was hoping and praying we would get another shot at him.\\" This led to the Yankees not winning a World Series in the 1980s, the only decade they would not have won a championship since moving to the Bronx. In contrast, the Dodgers were able to defeat the Oakland Athletics in the 1988 World Series. It would be their last post-season meeting to date, the last time ever the Dodgers visited the old Yankee Stadium, and the last meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship until the Rangers and the Kings squared off in the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals. Rivalry in the 21st Century upright Although the Yankees and the Dodgers have not met in the playoffs since the 1981 World Series, interleague matchups between the two teams, whether in New York or Los Angeles, have become quite popular. Tickets in both cities have become exclusive shortly after going on sale and games between the two teams have drawn sell out crowds, as evidenced during the doubleheader at the new Yankee Stadium in June 2013, the first time the Dodgers visited the Bronx since interleague play was introduced and the first time they visited the new Yankee Stadium. =Interleague Matchups and Other Points of Connection= After 23 years of not facing the Yankees, LA hosted an interleague weekend series in June 2004 where they took two out of three contests. One ending had closer √âric Gagn√© strike out Bernie Williams for the final out. The third and final game was the ESPN Sunday Night game that weekend. The rivalry was renewed when Joe Torre, who led the Yankees to four World Series championships, accepted a three-year, $13 million contract to manage the Dodgers on November 1, 2007. He also brought along former Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly and Larry Bowa to his coaching staff. Coaches Rick Honeycutt and Mariano Duncan each played for both teams. Torre and left fielder Manny Ramirez, who had been a part of the fierce Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox rivalry before being traded to the Dodgers mid-season, led the Dodgers to the 2008 West Division Pennant. The Yankees failed to make the 2008 Postseason, ending their 13-year consecutive postseason appearance streak with 12 of which were under Torre's. Both teams made it to the playoffs in 2009, but the Dodgers lost in the NLCS for the second straight year to the defending champion Philadelphia Phillies (whom the Dodgers beat in the NLCS in 1977 and 1978 before losing to the Yankees in the World Series in both years), who would lose to the Yankees in the World Series, giving New York their first championship since Torre left as manager. The Yankees and Dodgers met again at Dodger Stadium for an interleague series June 25‚Äì27, 2010. This marked the first time Joe Torre and Don Mattingly faced off against the Yankees as members of the Dodgers. The Yankees were victorious, winning the series two games to one. Mattingly succeeded Torre as manager of the Dodgers after the 2010 season. The Dodgers never played a regular season series at the original Yankee Stadium. The teams finally met up during the 2013 season. The double header of June 19 was not just the Dodgers return to the Bronx after a long absence; it was also Mattingly's first return to the Bronx since he became Dodger manager (excluding Mattingly's visit to new Yankee Stadium on the night they honored George Steinbrenner with a monument in Monument Park). Former Dodger pitcher Hiroki Kuroda won the first game for the Yankees while the Dodgers rebounded in the night cap behind the pitching of Chris Capuano. The two then split a 2-game series at Dodger Stadium. In their September 12‚Äì14, 2016 meeting at Yankee Stadium, the Dodgers took two out of three games from the Yankees. The Dodgers' and Yankees' most recent meeting was August 23‚Äì25, 2019 at Dodger Stadium. The Yankees won two contests in a three-game series featuring the teams with the best records in their respective leagues at the time. The 2019 series was held during the annual Players Weekend, with the Yankees wearing all-black uniforms and the Dodgers in all-white uniforms for all three games.

He has been with his partner since 1984. Barnes attended Bennington College. In 1984 Barnes graduated from Yale Law School with a juris doctor, and in 1991 he received his L.L.M. from Columbia University School of Law. Legal career In 1987 first-year Columbia students expressed appreciation of Barnes.In 1988, as an associate professor of the Columbia Law School, Barnes founded the AIDS Law Clinic. He is a faculty member at the Yale Law School and lecturer at the Yale Medical School. He has taught at several other law schools, including Harvard Law School, NYU Law School, Brooklyn Law School, Cardozo Law School, and New York Law School. He has taught courses in the ethics and law of human subjects research, healthcare law, public health, managed care law, occupational health and safety law, the regulation of narcotics, and law and medicine. =AIDS Law Clinic= Barnes and Professor Deborah Greenberg at Columbia Law School founded the first legal clinic addressing the AIDS crisis, to allow law students to represent persons living with AIDS in anti- discrimination cases.Kristina Campbell, \\"Mark Barnes wants AIDS Action Council to be a \\"tough presence\\", The Washington Blade, January 6, 1994 The program was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Education and received referrals from the New York City Commission on Human Rights and the State Division of Human Rights. The clinical education director at Columbia said of Barnes: \\"[He] is a leader in the field, and we're lucky to have him.

The clinic was praised by public health officials and by students as hands-on experience, but the school did not commit to continue it. When it did not renew Barnes' contract, students protested, and the issue was covered in the press. On April 12, 1989, 200 students protested Columbia Law School's attempts to close the \\"school's successful and much praised 'AIDS' legal clinic.\\"John Hammond, \\"Students Demonstrate at Columbia; Protest Department of AIDS Clinic Co- Director,\\" New York Native, May 1, 1989. They held a sit-in at the law school building to demand the faculty committee renew Barnes's contract for another year. \\"We thought one of the reasons for him not being reappointed is the lack of support for the clinic by the university,\\" said Maya Wiley, 3L and protest organizer.William Douglas, Students Stage Sit-in To Aid Law Lecturer, New York Newsday, April 14, 1989.; Constance Hays, Students Protest Possible Closign of Legal Clinic, The New York Times, April 16, 1989. Dean Barbara Black said the school supported the clinic, but declined to say why Barnes was not offered another one-year contract. Wiley said, \\"In all of our conversations with the powers-that-be at this school, it's been very clear to us that the clinic is in jeopardy and that there is a prevailing attitude among the powers-that-be opposed to the clinical approach.\\" Student Matt Levine said: \\"We do care about Mark Barnes because he has run the clinic extremely well. But the core issue is the continuation of the AIDS clinic.\\" On April 19, co-founder Deborah Green announced the school would keep the clinic open.D.J. Saunders, \\"AIDS law clinic stays,\\" New York Daily News, April 20, 1989. On June 28, 1989, the Columbia Spectator reported that Barnes was reappointed and promoted from Clinic Advisor to the Assistant Clinical Professor of Law by the faculty.Gerson Rothschild, Barnes reappointed to run Law School AIDS clinic, Columbia Spectator, June 28, 1989. \\"I'm gratified that the clinic will continue for an additional semester, but the challenge for the Law School is going to be the continuation of the clinic after the fall semester,\\" said Barnes. Public service In 1989, Barnes began working as the AIDS policy director for the New York State Department of Health, and later served as the executive director of AIDS Action Council, the primary national lobbying group focused on care and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The appointment as executive director of AIDS Action Council was criticized by an activist with ACT UP/Washington, who said that Barnes' appointment was a \\"commitment to mediocrity\\" and that a director living with AIDS should have been chosen. In 1992, while serving as the associate commissioner of the New York City Department of Health he wrote and managed the adoption of new health regulations that allowed the public health authorities to detain and treat patients with tuberculosis who had failed to take their anti-tuberculosis medications. Barnes participated in the first-ever White House Conference on HIV and AIDS on December 6, 1995. He has been a consultant for the National Commission on AIDS, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Red Cross, and the National Minority Task Force on AIDS. In 2000, he was appointed by then-Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala to the new National Human Research Protections Advisory Committee, which examined issues of ethical conduct in human medical experimentation.New York Law Journal, Today's News: Update, January 4, 2001. He later served on the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections. In 2012 he co- founded, and continues to serve as faculty co-chair of, the Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Center of Harvard University and Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, a project designed to improve the planning, conduct and regulation of multi- national clinical trials, with a special emphasis on trials in the emerging economies. In 2004, he was the founding executive director of the Harvard University AIDS treatment programs in Nigeria, Tanzania and Botswana funded under the PEPFAR program.

A method of food progression, BLW facilitates the development of age appropriate oral motor control while maintaining eating as a positive, interactive experience. Baby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by \\"self-feeding\\" from the start of their experience with food. The term weaning should not be taken to imply giving up breast milk or formula, but simply the introduction of foods other than breast milk or formula. Methods Baby-led weaning (term self-attributed to Gill Rapley ) places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smell as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, choosing which foods to concentrate on. Instead of the traditional method of spooning pureed food into the baby's mouth, the baby is presented with a plate of varied finger food from which to choose. Infants are offered a range of foods to provide a balanced diet from around 6 months. They often begin by picking up and licking or sucking on the piece food, before progressing to eating. Babies are typically able to begin self-feeding at around 6 months old, although some are ready and will reach for food as early as 5 months and some will wait until 7 or 8 months. The intention of this process is that it is tailored to suit the individual baby and their personal development. The 6-month-old guideline provided by the World Health Organization is based on research indicating that the time period from 6 to 18‚Äì24 months of age is when the risk of malnutrition is high in infants. Initial self-feeding attempts often result in very little food ingested as the baby explores textures and tastes through play, but the baby will soon start to swallow and digest what is offered. Formula or breastfeeding is continued in conjunction with weaning and milk is always offered before solids in the first 12 months. Although breastfeeding is the nutritional ideal precursor to baby led weaning (as the baby has been exposed to different flavors via its mother's breast milk and the jaw action used during breastfeeding helps the baby learn to chew), it is also entirely possible to introduce a formula-fed baby to solids using the BLW method. Formula-fed babies can successfully wean using BLW.Susan A. Sullivan, Leann L. Birch 1994 http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/93/2/271.abstract Providing an infant with table foods initiates the development of strong oral motor control for chewing and swallowing, including tongue lateralization and eventual bolus formation. When an infant mouths a food texture, the tongue lateralization reflex forces them to move their tongue to the side to lick and taste the food. Through continued practice, infants learn to volitionally lateralize their tongue‚Äîthe first step in the development of a munching/chewing pattern. Basic principles The basic principles of baby-led weaning are: * At the start of the process the baby is allowed to reject food, and it may be offered again at a later date. * The child is allowed to decide how much it wants to eat. No \\"fill-ups\\" are to be offered at the end of the meal with a spoon. * The meals should not be hurried. * Meals should be offered at times when parents are also eating, to set example and aid in learning through behavior mirroring. * Sips of water are offered with meals. * Initially, soft fruits and vegetables are given. Harder foods are lightly cooked to make them soft enough to chew on even with bare gums. * Non-finger-foods, such as oatmeal and yogurt, may be offered with a spoon so the baby can learn to self-feed with a spoon.  Relation to child development  As recommended by the World Health Organization and several other health authorities across the world, there is no need to introduce solid food to a baby's diet until after 6 months, and by then the child's digestive system and their fine motor skills have developed enough to allow them to self-feed. Baby-led weaning takes advantage of the natural development stages of the child. = Motor Development = From infancy, the only oral motor pattern appreciated is suck-swallow-breathe. This reflexive way of eating allows infants to feed from birth (from a breast or bottle) while protecting their airway and meeting their nutritional needs. The oral motor patterns required for eating and swallowing solids include tongue lateralization, tongue elevation, and munching/chewing, and unlike the suck- swallow-breathe sequence, coordination of these oral motor patterns is learned, not reflexive. When an infant is offered a spoon of puree, the practiced or familiar oral motor pattern is sucking. As purees are thicker than formula or breast milk, puree is sucked off of a presented spoon and moved in the mouth in a similar fashion as liquid. This is generally looked at as a part of the process of introducing solid foods and parents are often encouraged to push past this. Conversely, current research supports that delayed experience with eating lumpy foods leads to poor food acceptance in later years. Through playful exploration, BLW provides an opportunity for infants to practice new oral motor patterns. Through this method, infants gradually develop the oral motor patterns required for mature bolus manipulation, chewing, and swallowing, as well as allow the infant to be in charge of what goes in their mouth, how it goes in, and when. According to one theory, the baby will choose foods with the nutrients she might be slightly lacking, guided by taste. The baby learns most effectively by watching and imitating others, and allowing her to eat the same food at the same time as the rest of the family contributes to a positive weaning experience. Self- feeding supports the child's motor development on many vital areas, such as their hand-eye coordination and chewing. It encourages the child towards independence and often provides a stress-free alternative for meal times, for both the child and the parents. Some babies refuse to eat solids when offered with a spoon, but happily help themselves to finger food. The authors of BLW assert other strategies which are in line with traditional feeding safety guidelines. For example, it is recommended that infants are seated upright, in a supportive high chair for all feeding experiences. This reduces the impact of gravity on swallowing, allowing for easy expulsion of the bolus by gagging, decreasing accidental movement of the food into the pharynx. Additionally, a child who has the trunk and head control to sit independently though a meal (proximal stability) will more likely demonstrate adequate distal coordination for strong oral motor control. = Gag Reflex = When infants bring solid foods to their own mouth, they are the ones guiding the sensory experience, starting and stopping when they are comfortable and ready. When food does move too posteriorly in the mouth triggering a gag reflex, the entire bolus is expelled from the mouth. Also, food moves slowly in comparison to liquid, and is not often sucked into the pharynx, allowing for laryngeal penetration or aspiration of the bolus. The food bolus will trigger a gag response first and be expelled before it hits the laryngeal vestibule. Infants therefore utilize the gag reflex for learning three important concepts: the borders of their mouth, desensitizing their gag reflex, and how to protect their airway when volitionally swallowing solid foods. As infants get closer to one year old, the gag reflex moves posteriorly, closer to the laryngeal vestibule. This allows food to move closer to the laryngeal vestibule before triggering a gag. Although this allows for increased ability to safely swallow, if oral skills are immature due to lack of practice, this puts older infants at a high risk for choking and aspiration of immaturely chewed food materials into the lungs. Oral motor development would suggest that if an infant does not learn how to manage a bolus intra-orally and time their swallow, more choking would occur after the age of one, when traditionally more solid foods are added to the child's diet. There have been no clinical studies completed to support this connection between movement of the gag reflex and choking. It is still suggested to avoid classic ‚Äúchoking hazards‚Äù or airway shaped foods: whole grapes, coin-shaped slices of hotdogs, cherry tomatoes, etc.  Scientific research  Very little scientific research has been done regarding baby-led weaning. However, a study headed by child health specialist Charlotte M. Wright from the University of Glasgow, Scotland found that while BLW works for most babies, it could lead to nutritional problems for children who develop more slowly than others. Wright concluded \\"that it is more realistic to encourage infants to self-feed with solid finger food during family meals, but also give them spoon fed purees.\\"\\"Baby-Led Weaning Is Feasible but Could Cause Nutritional Problems for Minority of Infants\\" Science Daily. January 14, 2011. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110112081454.htm Conversely, the natural diet of an infant up to age one is breast milk (or a synthetic equivalent such as formula). It is important for parents to not decrease the volume of milk feeds until around one year of age or until the baby is taking in enough solid foods to support weight-gain (AAP, 2013). Proponents of BLW would argue that breast-feeding mothers should change their own diet to improve the infant's nutrition before pushing for increase solid food intake. Historically, mothers used to be told to maintain a strict schedule for breast feeding, limiting the time at breast and the frequency . As a result, many mothers had low milk supply (as breast milk is a supply-demand phenomenon), and therefore their babies ‚Äúfailed to thrive.‚Äù Not surprisingly, the amount of formula available skyrocketed, as did the availability of strained or mashed ‚Äúbaby foods.‚Äù By the 1930s, a variety of Gerber purees were available for purchase. Current breast feeding recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics are that infants should be breast fed for the first 6 months, then be gradually introduced to solid food between the age of 6 months and 1 year. A more recent study at the University of Nottingham by Ellen Townsend and Nicola J. Pitchford suggests that baby-led weaning may lead to less obesity in childhood. The authors conclude that the \\"results suggest that infants weaned through the baby-led approach learn to regulate their food intake in a manner, which leads to a lower BMI and a preference for healthy foods like carbohydrates.\\". Feeding specialist, Kary Rappaport, OTR/L, SWC, CLE also concludes that a BLW infant, who leads their own food exploration and is exposed to a consistent variety of tastes, textures, and smells at an early age is more likely to develop positive interest in food. This may decrease ‚Äúpicky‚Äù eating behaviors in toddlers and young children. Researcher Joel Voss, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University states, \\"The bottom line is, if you're not the one who's controlling your learning, you're not going to learn as well\\". When an adult takes control of the activity, the inherent love of exploration and discovery is lost. BLW allows for natural, developmentally appropriate interaction and play with food, which has the potential to develop a lifelong curiosity with food. As of June 2019, it was suggested that long- term studies need to be done on the effects of BLW on nutrition adequacy and safety in addition to previous evidence that it is useful in self-regulation of feeding with low risk of choking.

When Columbia reconstituted itself as a university and relocated to Morningside Heights in the 1890s, there were originally no plans for the area south of 116th Street, where Hamilton Hall now sits, or for any facilities dedicated to the undergraduate college. Nevertheless, college advocates persevered and the cornerstone for the new Hamilton Hall was laid in 1905. The building was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White in the neoclassical style, in conformity with the rest of the university campus. It was completed in 1907. In the latter half of the 20th century, Hamilton Hall was taken over several times in the course of student protest activity, most famously during the protests of April 1968. In the course of this protest, a multiracial group first barricaded themselves inside the building, imprisoning acting dean Henry S. Coleman in his office. The black students eventually asked the white students to leave, prompting the latter's takeover of several other university buildings. After the violent end to the April activities, Hamilton was the most peacefully cleared hall but was briefly reoccupied later that year. The building was also the site of a major 1985 student strike and barricade to demand university divestment from South Africa, which was under the apartheid system at the time, as well as ethnic studies classes at the university. Most recently, Hamilton Hall has undergone extensive renovations in order to restore many of its historic details. The building houses many of the classes of Columbia College's famous Core Curriculum, and it is apparently a tradition of the teachers of the Core class Contemporary Civilization to watch students filing into the building for exams from the roof of nearby Butler Library.

The senator in each U.S. state with the longer time in office is known as the senior senator; the other is the junior senator. This convention has no official standing, though seniority confers several benefits, including preference in the choice of committee assignments and physical offices. When senators have been in office for the same length of time, a number of tiebreakers, including previous offices held, are used to determine seniority.  Benefits of seniority  The United States Constitution does not mandate differences in rights or power, but Senate rules give more power to senators with more seniority. Generally, senior senators will have more power, especially within their own caucuses. In addition, by custom, senior senators from the president's party control federal patronage appointments in their states. There are several benefits, including the following: * Traditionally, the most senior member of the majority party is named president pro tempore of the Senate. * Senators are given preferential treatment in choosing committee assignments based on seniority. Seniority on a committee is based on length of time serving on that committee, which means a senator may rank above another in committee seniority but be more junior in the full Senate. Although the committee chairmanship is an elected position, it is traditionally given to the most senior senator of the majority party serving on the committee, and not already holding a conflicting position such as chairmanship of another committee. The ranking member of a committee (called the vice-chairman in some select committees) is elected in the same way. * Greater seniority enables a senator to choose a desk closer to the front of the Senate Chamber. * Senators with higher seniority may choose to move into better office space as those offices are vacated. * Seniority determines the ranking in the United States order of precedence although other factors, such as being a former president or first lady, can place an individual higher in the order of precedence.  Determining the beginning of a term  The beginning of an appointment does not necessarily coincide with the date the Senate convenes or when the new senator is sworn in. In the case of senators first elected in a general election for the upcoming Congress, their terms begin on the first day of the new Congress. Since 1935, that means January 3 of odd-numbered years. The seniority date for an appointed senator is usually the date of the appointment, although the actual term does not begin until they take the oath of office. An incoming senator who holds another office, including membership in the U.S. House of Representatives, must resign from that office before becoming a senator. Determining length of seniority A senator's seniority is primarily determined by length of continuous service; for example, a senator who has served for 12 years is more senior than one who has served for 10 years. Because several new senators usually join at the beginning of a new Congress, seniority is determined by prior federal or state government service and, if necessary, the amount of time spent in the tiebreaking office. These tiebreakers in order are: # Former senator # Former vice president # Former House member # Former Cabinet secretary # Former state governor # Population of state based on the most recent census when the senator took office # Alphabetical by last name (in the case where two senators came from the same state on the same day and have identical credentials) When more than one senator has served in the same previous role, length of time in that prior office is used to break the tie. For instance, Ben Cardin, Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, Amy Klobuchar, Sheldon Whitehouse and Jon Tester took office on January 3, 2007, and the first three senators mentioned had previously served in the House of Representatives. Cardin, having served 20 years, is more senior than Sanders, who served 16 years, who in turn is more senior than Brown, who served 14 years. Casey, Klobuchar, Whitehouse, and Tester rank in that order because as of the 2000 census, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Montana had populations that ranked in that order, so Tester is ranked 33rd in seniority when the 116th United States Congress convened. Current seniority list Only relevant factors are listed below. For senators whose seniority is based on their state's respective population, the state population ranking is given as determined by the relevant United States Census current at the time that they began service. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - valign=bottom !

The route is predominantly a two-lane highway as it runs through McKeesport and other suburbs. The entire routing of PA 48 is part of the Orange Belt, both reaching their southern termini at Pennsylvania Route 51, southeast of Elizabeth. Until 1998, the northern terminus of PA 48 was at the intersection of Old Haymaker and Center Roads, about 1/2 mile from its current terminus at U.S. Route 22 Business in Monroeville. Route description PA 48 begins at an intersection with PA 51 in Forward Township, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Scenery Drive. PA 48 is concurrent with the Orange Belt of the Allegheny County belt system at this point, with which it remains concurrent with for the entire length. The route immediately turns to the north-northwest and forms the border between Forward Township to the west and Elizabeth Township to the east, passing through a mix of fields and woods with some homes.

Farther north, the road becomes the border between the borough of Lincoln to the west and Elizabeth Township to the east as it heads through more forested areas with a few homes. The route fully enters Elizabeth Township again and heads into commercial areas as it comes to the community of Boston, crossing the Youghiogheny River on the Boston Bridge. At this point, PA 48 heads northwest into the borough of Versailles, passing over CSX's Keystone Subdivision railroad line and becoming Walnut Street as it passes a mix of homes and businesses. The route crosses into the city of McKeesport and widens into a divided highway as it comes to an intersection with PA 148. Here, PA 148 continues along Walnut Street and PA 48 turns east onto four-lane undivided Long Run Road, passing through more residential and commercial areas. The road curves south by more businesses prior to curving east past a mix of woods and commercial development, briefly entering Versailles again before crossing back into McKeesport. The route curves north before heading northeast and entering the borough of White Oak. Upon crossing Lincoln Way, PA 48 becomes Jacks Run Road and narrows to two lanes, entering more forested areas with occasional homes and businesses. The road continues north and heads into North Versailles Township and passes through more wooded areas of development, turning northeast and coming to an intersection with US 30. Past this junction, the route becomes Mosside Boulevard and runs past businesses prior to heading into forested areas. The road briefly passes through the borough of Wall prior to crossing back into North Versailles Township and heading into commercial areas, turning northeast. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway and passes over Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line and Turtle Creek, entering the borough of Monroeville. Here, PA 48 becomes an undivided road as it comes to an intersection with PA 130. Following this, the road narrows to two lanes and passes through woods, curving more to the north. Farther north, the route enters commercial areas, widening into a four-lane road at the Haymarker Road intersection. PA 48 turns northwest, passing more businesses and reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with US 22 Business near an interchange that has access to I-376/US 22 and I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike). Cancelled PA 48 North-South Parkway In 1963, a new PA 48 expressway was proposed to run parallel to the current PA 48 alignment from PA 51 in Elizabeth to the PA Turnpike/Parkway East Interchange in Monroeville. Although several houses and an amusement complex of swimming pool, amusement park and drive-in theater (called Rainbow Gardens) were demolished in the process, the project was scrapped by the 1970s.

The genus includes about 60 species, native to North Africa, Indomalaya, the Middle East, and Australia. They are perennials, annuals, or subshrubs, with five-petalled flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, that strongly resemble the better-known Geranium (cranesbill). Cultivated plants are known as filarees or heron's bill in North America, whereas in the British Isles they are usually called storksbills.  Taxonomy  Carl Linnaeus grouped in the same genus (Geranium), the three similar genera Erodium, Geranium, and Pelargonium. The distinction between them was made by Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle based on the number of stamens or anthers: five for Erodium,Parnell, J. and Curtis. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. seven for Pelargonium, and ten for Geranium. However, the three genera have the same characteristics in regard to their fruit, which resemble long bird beaks. That characteristic is the basis for the names: Geranium evokes the crane (Greek geranos), Pelargonium the stork (pelargos), and Erodium the heron (erodios).  Cultivation  In cultivation, erodiums are usually seen in rockeries or alpine gardens. The hybrid cultivar E. √ó variabile 'Roseum' (E. corsicum √ó E. reichardii), a compact, spreading perennial with rose-pink flowers in summer, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

It is located three miles (5 km) south of Welaka, in the Mount Royal Airpark, off County Road 309 on the eastern bank of the St. Johns River. The site consists of a large sand mound and several nearby middens. The Mount Royal site was occupied beginning about 4,000 years ago. The site was largely unoccupied from 500 BCE until AD 750. Mount Royal was occupied again after 750, and after 1050 it grew into the main town of an important chiefdom with connections to the Mississippian culture. The town lost importance after 1300, but a settlement, called Enacape, was still there when Europeans entered the area in the 1560s. The Spanish mission of San Antonio de Enacape was located in the town from 1595 until after 1656. Location The Mount Royal site is located on the east side of the St. Johns River between Lake George, to the south, and Little Lake George. The site is on the north side of a short section of the river that flows to the west (the river in general flows northward). The most prominent feature is a large sand mound about from the river. A causeway or avenue, still visible at the end of the 19th century, but since obscured, ran north from the mound to a rectangular pond. The mound is on a parcel now owned by the State of Florida. The surrounding area, including the middens and village area, is part of the Mount Royal Airpark residential development. Archaeological investigation =The Bartrams= The Mount Royal site entered the archaeological record in 1766, when John Bartram and his son William visited it. William returned to the site 15 years later. They found a sand mound in diameter, and almost tall. The Bartrams described an \\"avenue\\" running north from the mound, with raised banks on the sides. The avenue was \\"level as a floor\\", wide, and extended about to a rectangular pond wide and long. John Bartram speculated the pond had been a borrow pit from which the sand in the mound had been taken. On William's return to the site, he found that an orange grove and palms and live oaks that had flanked the avenue in 1766 had been cleared in preparation for planting. The 19th-century archaeologist Samuel Haven called the reports published by the Bartrams \\"the earliest 'careful and intelligent' descriptions of a native American Indian mound.\\" =Clarence Moore= In 1891, Clarence Bloomfield Moore, a self- trained archaeologist, investigated shell middens along the St. Johns River. In 1893, he returned to the St. Johns and began excavating sand mounds, including the one at Mount Royal. In two short seasons (two-and-a-half weeks in 1893 and three weeks in 1894), Moore excavated and backfilled almost all of the sand mound. He published his findings at Mount Royal in two parts in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in 1894, a total of more than 250 pages. Before Moore's first visit, the mound had been plowed over and the sides of the mound had slumped down, raising the ground level around the mound. As a result, Moore encountered problems with measuring the height of the mound. He estimated that the mound was 4.9 m. high, and stated that it had been much higher originally. He reported that the mound was in circumference. The connection of the avenue to the mound was no longer discernible. He reported that the avenue was wide, flanked by berms that were an average of high and wide. =Later investigations= In the early 1950s John Goggin and his students from the University of Florida collected potsherds and other artifacts from the ground surface of the middens and other areas surrounding the Mount Royal mound. By this time the avenue reported by the Bartrams and Moore was no longer visible from the ground, but did show up in aerial photos. With the area slated for residential development, B. Calvin Jones of the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research conducted investigations in 1983, 1994 and 1995, including shovel tests and focused excavations of selected areas. The mound Copper plate, nearly square, found in Mount Royal mound in Florida Copper plate, square, from Mount Royal mound in Florida Moore found charcoal mixed with the sand at the bottom of the mound. While not saying so explicitly for Mount Royal, Moore speculated in his reports on excavations of other sand mounds along the St. Johns River that fire was used in rituals at the beginning of mound construction. Other than some white sand at the base, the mound was constructed with yellow sand from the immediate vicinity. Sand that had been colored by the addition of hematite was found in layers in the mound. Artifacts were more common in the hematite- tinted sand layers than in untinted sand. The entire mound had been capped with hematite-colored sand, in a layer up to deep in one section. Moore described the color of the hematite-tinted sand as \\"crushed strawberry\\", \\"brick red\\", and \\"Indian red\\". Most of the artifacts found in the mound were in the top of the mound. A few artifacts were found in the base of the mound, but the part of the mound from above ground level was almost completely bare of artifacts. Burials were found throughout the mound, but the skeletons were always decayed, and in many cases only teeth were left. Early occupation The first inhabitants of the Mount Royal site, who arrived around 2000 BCE, practiced the culture of the Orange period. Orange period people were hunter- gatherers, harvesting shellfish and fish from the rivers and coastal waters of northeastern Florida, gathering wild plants, and hunting. The Orange period began with the appearance of pottery in northeastern Florida, shortly after the appearance of pottery in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the earliest in North America. Around 500 BCE the Orange period developed into the St. Johns culture. During the first part of the St. Johns Culture, called St. Johns I, There were many sites occupied along the St. Johns River, but there is no evidence that the Mount Royal site was occupied during that period. Beginning around 750, as the St. Johns I transitioned into the St. Johns II period, people returned to occupy the Mount Royal site. Moore noted that St. Johns Check Stamped pottery, diagnostic of the St Johns II period, was present from the beginning of construction of the Mount Royal mound. While St. Johns people were probably already raising squashes and other plants in gardens, the cultivation of maize was likely introduced early in the St. Johns II period. Political complexity After about 1050, chiefdoms developed among the people of the St. Johns culture. The chief of a larger village would exert political power over smaller villages in the area. Particular powerful chiefs would form confederations with other chiefdoms. The most powerful chiefdoms, wielding political and religious power, became ceremonial centers, with their status demonstrated by the construction of mounds. Mount Royal was such a ceremonial center for centuries, perhaps the largest over a wide area along the St. Johns River. On May 7, 1973, Mount Royal was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

He served as Mayor of Jacksonville, Florida from 1967 to 1979. During his administration, the City of Jacksonville consolidated with Duval County, making him the last mayor of the old city government and the first mayor of a consolidated Jacksonville. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Early life Tanzler was born in Jacksonville, and graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in 1945. He was an outstanding athlete, lettering in football, basketball and baseball, and Duke University offered him a football scholarship. When a fire at Lee High School incinerated his academic record, Duke declined to enroll him; however, the University of Florida would, and offered him an athletic scholarship. Tanzler decided to go to Gainesville, but with World War II still ongoing, he was required to serve 18 months in the United States Navy. After arriving late for the fall term, Florida football coach Raymond Wolf decided to redshirt Tanzler, and recommended that he play basketball to stay in shape. Tanzler was a walk-on for the 1946-47 Florida Gators men's basketball team, and averaged nearly 11 points per game. He became a stand-out player, scoring in double figures all four years, and was named third-team All-SEC in his senior year, when he became the first Florida basketball player to pass 1,000 points in his college career. He earned his bachelor's degree from Florida in 1949, then his law degree in 1951. He was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \\"Gator Great\\".F Club, Hall of Fame, Gator Greats. Retrieved December 13, 2014.Mike Bianchi, \\" UF football team gets title trophies,\\" The Gainesville Sun, p. 6F (April 14, 1985). Retrieved September 7, 2014. After graduating, Tanzler practiced law and eventually became a judge serving on the criminal court. Career In 1967 Tanzler ran against incumbent mayor Lou Ritter for the Democratic nomination. He ran on a ticket of reform as a \\"white hat\\", a supporter of consolidation of the City of Jacksonville and Duval County governments. In those days, the Democratic primary was the real contest in Jacksonville. Tanzler defeated Ritter in the primary, then easily defeated Republican William Hembree in the general election. Two months later, on August 8, 1967, voters approved the Jacksonville Consolidation. This meant Tanzler had to stand again for mayor of the new government on September 26. However, no one else filed, thus he became the first mayor in Jacksonville history to be elected unopposed. When consolidation took effect on October 1, 1968, Tanzler became the last mayor of the old city government and the first mayor of a consolidated Jacksonville. As mayor, Tanzler initiated a number of projects to revitalize Jacksonville's downtown with new revenues brought in by consolidation. Among the projects were the creation of what is now the Downtown Campus of Florida State College at Jacksonville, the construction of a large-scale public health facility, and the completion of major commercial construction projects including the skyscraper now known as the Wells Fargo Center. His most lauded contribution was his effort to clean up the St. Johns River, toward which he implemented sewage treatment and other environmental regulations. Tanzler was reelected in 1971, after defeating former Jacksonville mayor and Florida governor W. Haydon Burns, a \\"black hat\\" anti- consolidation activist, in the Democratic primary, and then easily winning the general election. Tanzler divorced his first wife, Ann Lyerly Tanzler, mother of their son Hans Gearhart Tanzler III, and married the former LaMercedes Hutchins Woodard in 1973. The couple had one child, Hans, III, and two stepchildren from her former marriage to an Air Force test pilot. He was reelected a second time in 1975, defeating Republican Don Trednick in the general election. In 1978 Tanzler announced his candidacy for Governor of Florida.

The majority of the plot occurs in a fictional land named Adria, which is based on Medieval Western Europe, with parts of later books occurring in 1990s Denver, USA. Though many of the locations in Adria are fictional, the geography, culture, and language are realistic depictions of Europe during the 14th-15th centuries. The author describes Adria's placement in this way: \\"Imagine a slash between France and Germany, and then insert about 300 miles\\". The story arc takes place against the backdrop of historical events such as: the Medieval Inquisition by the Catholic church; the Crusades; the Western Schism; the fading of feudalism and the concomitant rise of a prosperous commerce- driven middle class; the Black Death plagues; the introduction of cannon into European warfare; and in the later books, contemporary urban decay.

They are immortal in the sense that they don't die of old age or disease (the eldest of them is roughly four and one half billion years old), though they can be killed or die from grief. The purpose of the Elves is to provide \\"aid and comfort\\" to all living things, but especially their beloved human cousins. Against this urge to help, they find themselves feared, hated, and persecuted by humans because of their immortality and extra-human, nearly godlike, powers of prescience, manipulation of the future, healing, and control over physical items. Over time, they have faded, for multiple reasons: they reproduce very seldom; some have chosen to fade from the earth due to grief or personal loss; and they have been persecuted by humans. Likewise, their powers are waning with the passing of time. In 1500 CE, they disappear entirely, but their bloodlines remain, due to interbreeding with humans over the years. Hundreds of years later, in the 1990s, the blood suddenly starts manifesting itself in certain people. What becomes of them after the 1990s has never been fleshed out by the author. Physical aspects of the Elves Physically, Elves are similar to humans, with the only obvious difference being their slightly pointed ears, which they often conceal by growing their hair long and using it to cover their ears when they wish to pass undetected. Male elves tend to have slighter builds than typical human men, with no facial hair at all; they are often described by the author as having a nearly womanly cast to their faces. Female elves tend to be slightly taller than typical human females, with the net result being that male and female elves are very similar in size and build to each other. All Elves possess graceful and strong bodies as well as perfect health. They are very difficult to kill, often continuing on after receiving wounds that would kill a human. Humans seeing them for the first time often assume they are trained in the martial arts, due to their extreme coordination and sense of being at ease with their bodies. Temperature extremes do not affect them, and they do not sweat when hot (the author originally had them sweating in the 1985 short story The Shadow of the Starlight, but changed it for the book series). They view all activities they engage in as smaller parts of the greater pattern of things, and because of this and their long life span, they attain a level of excellence that no human can match in whatever skills they pursue. As a consequence of their perception of the patterns of reality, they can discern things about the physical realm that are hidden from humans. Their senses are superhumanly keen, with extraordinarily sharp hearing and sight that is not affected by darkness. Elves and those with elven blood can often see a silvery sheen surrounding other elves and those with elvish blood, especially when their powers are active. When walking, they usually make no sound at all, even when they are in a hurry or their feet are encumbered. Powers of the Elves The Elves' powers are described in terms of the Elves' awareness of and influence over the patterns of reality, much in the same vein as the Moirai of Greek myth. They can discern the patterns of cause and effect in a very real and palpable manner, and they can selectively re-weave the patterns to suit their desires, though it greatly drains them if the manipulation is in-depth or far-sweeping; they are also aware of the principle of unintended consequences, where a little meddling in the present can yield large and potentially disastrous results later. In practice, the Elves can change reality in nearly any way, the extent and means being limited only by their conscience, force of will, and energy given to the task. Some examples are: healing anything short of death; changing humans into animals, other humans, or Elves; seeing into the many possible futures or the distant past; changing massive items like castles into solid rock; seeing in the dark; mastering an instrument or weapon beyond any human's abilities; speaking with animals and plants; and changing aspects of a human's personality like fearlessness, happiness, intelligence, musical aptitude, aggression, etc. Story and character arcs *The super-arc of the Aurverelle's feud with the elves. Aurverelle's men kill the elf Mirya three hundred years before Strands of Starlight. Terrill and Varden avenge her by slaughtering the men of Aurverelle. Later, Baron Roger continues the Aurverelle ways and rapes Miriam. Varden, seeing his and Terrill's connection to Roger's actions, heals Miriam, who later becomes elven and drastically changes the path of the Aurverelle house. Two generations later, in Maze of Moonlight, Christopher of Aurverelle joins the Crusades to atone for his family's perceived failure. He returns a damaged man. Terrill, Mirya, and Natil, knowing their collective responsibility for his fate, come to aid as they can. They heal the young seer he has taken in, an action which eventually turns her elven. In defending Saint Brigid from mercenaries, they lay the foundation for it being eventually deserted. *The repeated infusion of starlight into Charity: when she was reborn from the Leather Woman; when Varden and Roxanne dissolved the barriers in Charity's mind between her past and present lives; when she was healed by Miriam in the forest; when she was healed by Miriam after being ridden down by Cranby. She becomes more than human, but less than elven. *Roxanne and Varden's child, Lake, is half-elven. Lake's wife, Miriam, is the girl whose mother was healed by Mirya in Strands of Starlight. Their daughter, Vanessa, is plagued by visions of the webs of probability and later becomes mostly Elven. *The transformation of Alban into a pig. His departure opens the way for the blacksmith's son, Kay to become priest in Saint Brigid. Later, Alban's attack on George Darci brings him and Terrill together.

It produces plastic model kits of a variety of vehicles, including model car, model aircraft, model ship and model Sci-fi mecha under Aoshima brand, along with finished toys under Skynet brand, diecast models under Miracle House brand, diecast cars under DISM brand and female statue figures under FunnyKnights brand.  History  In 1924, \\"Aoshima Airplane Research Institute\\" (ÈùíÂ≥∂È£õË°åÊ©üÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) was founded by airplane pilot Jiro Aoshima. In 1932, model-airplane was designated as an educational material in Japanese schools, and \\"Shizuoka model-airplane association\\" (ÈùôÂ≤°ÁúåÊ®°ÂûãÈ£õË°åÊ©üÂ∑•Ê•≠ÁµÑÂêà) was established. Jiro Aoshima acceded to the chairman's post. \\"Aoshima Bunka Kyozai RL\\" (ÈùíÂ≥∂ÊñáÂåñÊïôÊùêÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) was established in 1945. It was focusing on the wooden model-airplane manufacturing. \\"Aoshima Bunka Kyozai Inc.\\" (ÊúâÈôê‰ºöÁ§æ ÈùíÂ≥∂ÊñáÂåñÊïôÊùêÁ§æ) was established in 1961. Ichiro Aoshima acceded to the CEO's post. It released the first plastic model kit \\"Speed Boat Bluebird\\" in the same year. Then it started to develop plastic model kits in earnest. In the 1960s, Aoshima released 1/60 and 1/72 scale airplane models, 1/24 and 1/25 scale car models and original design sci-fi mecha models. In 1969, it released \\"Apollo series\\" spacecraft models including 1/48 scale \\"Eagle 5\\" Apollo Lunar Module and 1/96 scale Apollo spacecraft. These models became a big hit. In 1971, it started to release the 1/700 scale \\"Water Line series\\" warship models along with other three Shizuoka-based model manufacturers, Tamiya, Hasegawa and Fujimi. In the 1970s, Aoshima succeeded in the original development of kids products such as \\"Gattai Robo\\" (coalescent robot) series. In this series, four individual vehicles could coalesce into one robot. In 1980, it started to release \\"Anime scale\\" realistic robot models such as Ideon as a countermeasure against megahit Gundam models of Bandai. Aoshima was re-established as \\"Aoshima Bunka Kyozai Co., Ltd.\\" (Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ ÈùíÂ≥∂ÊñáÂåñÊïôÊùêÁ§æ) in 1986. It launched a new brand \\"Skynet\\" (finished toy brand) in 1997, and also launched a new brand \\"Miracle House\\" (diecast figure brand) in 1999. In 2002, with the bankruptcy of Japanese model manufacturer Imai Kagaku, Aoshima acquired the molds of sailing ships and sci-fi vehicles such as Thunderbirds machines. In 2005, Aoshima launched a new brand \\"DISM\\" (diecast car brand), and established \\"Aoshima Hong Kong, Ltd.\\" (ÈùíÂ≥∂È¶ôÊ∏ØÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏). Another new brand \\"FunnyKnights\\" (female statue figure brand) was launched in 2007. In 2008, Aoshima started to release \\"Itasha\\" (animation wrapping car) model kits and they gained a huge popularity. In 2010, Hayabusa (Space Craft Plastic Model Kit Series) made a big hit.  Product lines  = Aircraft = ;1/72 scale Fighter planes of World War II series :Fifteen World War II era single engine airplanes and two twin engine airplanes were released in the 1960s. There were minor airplanes such as Reppu (Sam), Shiun (Norm), Seiran, Zuiun (Paul) and P-63 Kingcobra among them. These models were rereleased several times, and some of them were available until the mid 2000s. ;1/72 scale True fighter planes of World War II series :In 1996, new 1/72 scale airplane models were released. This line consists of Kawanishi N1K1-Ja/Jb \\"Shiden\\", N1K2-J/Jb \\"Shiden kai\\" and Focke-Wulf Ta 152H-0/H-1.

In 2013, new model, Kawasaki Ki-100 were released in this series. = Spacecraft = ;Apollo series :About ten Apollo program related models were released in 1969 and 1970. While many of them were discontinued, 1/48 scale Apollo Lunar Module, 1/96 scale Apollo spacecraft with Lunar Module, and small scale Saturn V with launching pad were rereleased several times; the latest in 2009, the 40th anniversary year of moon landing. ;Space Craft series :This series started in the early 2010s. The line consists of Japanese spacecraft and launching rockets, such as 1/32 scale Hayabusa and 1/72 scale H-II Transfer Vehicle. = Warships = ;1/700 scale Water Line series :This series started in 1971 and renewal series (second edition) started in the early 1990s. This line consists of mainly WWII era Japanese warships and some foreign warships. Almost Japanese warships have finished renewal, and some new WWII warships and modern JMSDF ships were added in renewal series. However, as to the foreign warships, only German battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz have been renewed. Early Aoshima products were of poor quality in historical investigation and molding-technic, but several newly released second edition kits are said to be of excellent quality. ;1/350 scale Iron Clad series :This series was started in 2007 and consists of full-hull models of WWII era Japanese warship such as Kongo class battleship, Takao class and Myoko class heavy cruiser, Nagara class and Kuma class light cruiser and some submarines. = Military vehicles = ;1/72 scale Military series :This line was started in 2012 and consists of modern Japanese military vehicles such as JGSDF 3 1/2 ton truck variations, material carrier vehicle and Type 60 Self-propelled 106 mm Recoilless Gun. ;1/48 scale Remote Control AFV series :This line consists of JGSDF AFVs (such as type 74 MBT, Type 87 SPAAG, Type 89 IFV and Type 90 MBT), Modern MBTs (such as M1 Abrams and Leopard 2) and WWII era German tanks such as Tiger II. = Automobiles = Aoshima's car model range (in the universally popular 1/24 scale) strikes a good chord with modellers, particularly because much of their product range focuses on Japanese domestic models - well known in the actual size - but not as models. ;1/24 scale The Best car GT/Vintage series :A main automobile line. It consists of various Japanese car models. ;1/24 scale Itasha series :To enable modelers to create their own itasha models, these kits contain the decals of Japanese animation characters. ;Dekotora (decoration Truck) series :The models of this series contain large size decal sheet for artwork, and many decoration parts such as small lights. ;1/24 scale Tuned Car series :Consists of modified/tuned cars from notable in-house tuning shops such as Toyota Racing Development, Nismo, Mazdaspeed, and Ralliart.

The company's first model, an Interceptor Mk. 4, was launched in 1932, followed in 1936 by a range of 1:72 scale model aircraft kits made from cellulose acetate, which were the world's first. Polystyrene models were introduced in 1955, which offered kits of aircraft, ships and cars in various scales. By the 1970s, Frog's catalogue included a large number of lesser-known aircraft types, manufactured only by the company, as well as a number of ship kits. The last Frog-branded kits were produced in 1976, whereupon many of the Frog moulds were sold to the Soviet Union and marketed under the Novo name.  History  Founded in 1931 by Charles Wilmot and Joe Mansour, International Model Aircraft Ltd. (IMA) originally used the Frog brand name (said to stand for \\"Flies Right Off the Ground\\") on the Interceptor Mk.4 semi-scale rubber-band powered flying model, launched the following year. Also in 1932, a marketing partnership with the toy company Lines Bros Ltd. was formed and other Frog brand flying models followed. In 1936, a range of 1:72 scale aircraft models in kit or pre-built form, moulded in cellulose acetate, was launched under the Frog Penguin name (alluding to the non-flying nature of these models). These were the world's first plastic model construction kits. An early release was the No.21P Empire Flying Boat, issued in 1938. During the Second World War, the company produced flying models for target purposes and 1:72 scale aircraft recognition models. The Penguin range was dropped in 1949 but a new range of Frog polystyrene kits was introduced in 1955. A wide variety of aircraft, ship and car subjects in various scales were issued during the 1950s and 60s, 1:72 scale being standardised from 1963 onwards for aircraft models. Production of scale and non-scale flying models continued into the early 1960s. Frog's 1:72 line-up by the 1970s including a large number of lesser-known aircraft types that were not available from any other model manufacturer at the time, such as the Avro Shackleton, Martin Baltimore and Maryland, Vultee Vengeance, Curtiss Tomahawk, Blackburn Shark and Skua, Bristol 138 and Beaufort, Tupolev SB2, Supermarine Attacker and Scimitar, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Gloster Javelin, de Havilland Vampire, Hornet, and DH 110, Dewoitine D.520, Macchi MC202 Folgore, Fokker D21, Hawker Sea Fury and Tempest, Fairey Gannet, Barracuda and Firefly, General Aircraft Hotspur, Focke-Wulf Ta 152H, Messerschmitt Me 410, Arado Ar 234, Heinkel He 162, Dornier Do 335, Heinkel He 219, Gloster E.28/39, North American Mustang II, Vickers Vimy, Ryan NYP \\"Spirit of St Louis\\", de Havilland Gypsy Moth \\"Jason\\", and the Westland Wallace. Frog also produced a line of larger-sized aircraft as 1:96 scale models, subjects including the Bristol Britannia, Douglas DC-7, Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan, Handley Page Victor, de Havilland Comet, and the Vickers Viscount. A lone airship model was of the R100. In addition to aircraft models, Frog also produced a number of ship kits, four examples being the MV Shell Welder coastal oil tanker, the THLV South Goodwin Lightship, HMS Tiger, and an RNLI lifeboat. From 1968, Frog issued around 30 ex-Hasegawa kits, mostly 1:72 scale modern jet fighters, some 1:32 scale WWII-era fighters and 1:450 scale battleships.John W. Burns, The Collectors Value Guide for Scale Model Plastic Kits, Sixth Edition, 1994 In France, due to cultural disquiet over the word \\"frog\\", these kits were sold and marketed under the \\"Tri-ang\\" brand, whilst in North America, for similar reasons, the Frog name was thought unacceptable and the kits were repackaged as \\"Air Lines\\" ‚Äì an allusion to Lines Brothers Ltd ‚Äì the founders of IMA / Tri-ang. = Demise = In 1971, IMA's parent company, now Rovex Tri-ang, entered receivership and was acquired by Dunbee-Combex-Marx the following year. During the mid-1970s, some of the Frog kit moulds were transferred to various factories in the Soviet Union and the kits began to reappear under the Novo brand name. Moulds of Second World War Axis Powers subjects were acquired by Revell around 1977, the Axis types having been declined by Novo. The last Frog-branded kits were produced in 1976. In more recent years, some ex- Frog/Novo kits have been reissued by Revell and various East European manufacturers.  Model kit product ranges  Model subjects produced by Frog over the years include: ; Aircraft: 1:72, 1:96, and other scales, covering aircraft from World War I to Cold War era. ; Famous Warships:Various scales, mostly World War II era.

History  ESCI, an acronym for Ente Scambi Coloniali Internazionali, (Italian: Colonial Trade Exchange), was originally founded in the 1930s by Moses Agiman (b. Benghazi 1896), an Italian merchant of Libyan descent. Initially, the company dealt in import/export between Italy and its African colonies. The advent of racial laws during World War II forced the owner to move to Switzerland with his family until the end of the conflict. Returning to Italy, he resumed business activities undertaken previously and expanded, thanks to the economic boom of the 1960s. In the mid-1960s, Agiman entered the scale model market with the first imports of kits from Japan. The business expanded, and at the end of the decade, alongside the founder's son, Daniel Agiman (successor of his father), joined two new partners: Dino Coppola and Franco Baldrighi. E.S.C.I. became \\"ESCI Modellistica snc.\\", located in the industrial area of Via Torino in Cernusco sul Naviglio, MiIan. Compared to other modelling companies at the time, ESCI was primarily a sales office, able to make contacts and cultivate global business. The production division of the company relied on third-party companies and technicians, who commissioned craftsmen, moulds, and sometimes production and packaging. The company's production was diverse and ranged from talented producers in the industry as Italaerei (today Italeri), Otaki, LS, as well as local artisans. Thus, production ranged from moulds of high-level kits to less detailed moulds with raised panel lines. Real production began in 1972, with the launch of additional decal sheets which allowed modellers to finish the kits in different liveries for the first time. Each decal sheet was packaged in a plastic bag with a detailed instruction sheet containing eight different profile colors, and a third sheet with a detailed explanation of the history and origins of each insignia. The product achieved considerable commercial success, and ESCI was able to invest its new resources in 1:9 scale motorcycle kits. The first plastic production kit was the BMW R75 with sidecar, followed by the Harley-Davidson WLA, and the Z√ºndapp KS750, all hand- crafted by the famous creator master modeller Manuel Olive Sans. These were followed by the Sd.Kfz. 2 Kettenkrad and Volkswagen K√ºbelwagen. A partnership with Italerei was established for production of the moulds, which could not advertise this collaboration on the boxes, as they were formal rivals in the kit market. The relationship between ESCI and Italeri began in full friendship, even if later relations deteriorated for competitive reasons. The growing model kit industry led the company to start a new armour series, using the atypical and new 1:72 scale, usually used for planes, in contrast to the standard 1:76 scale. The dimensional consistency with the aircraft scale made their armour scale choice popular, thanks to a high level of quality that allowed ESCI to become one of the leading manufacturers in the kit market. Sales success led to the production of new moulds, and in 1977, ESCI launched a successful series of modern aircraft in 1:48 scale, followed by a successful series in 1:72 scale. Between 1977 and 1983 the production of moulds increased further, and the company inaugurated a practice followed widely used by all producers: several boxes of the same subject were released with new decal sheets or variants and new box art. Together with models of aircraft, armoured vehicles, and motorcycles, were also models of trucks, cars, trains, ships, and figures. The discerning choice of subjects was the basis of some commercial success of the company. A representative case was the mould of the Panavia Tornado in 1:48 scale, done in 1975 when the prototype of the real aircraft was undergoing its initial flight tests. The Tornado was the most advanced European aircraft of the time. Although lacking detail, the ESCI Tornado remained the only model for this plane in 1:48 for 17 years, becoming also the company's best-seller. In 1984, ESCI introduced separated track links for AFV model kits. In the same year they also started an innovative product: 1:12 scale cockpits of aircraft such as the F-104 and F-16. The 1985 catalogue, distributed by Ricordi in Milan, shows a redesign of the boxes, with the replacement of the predominant color white with red on box art. An impressive list of products was offered: 350 kits of aircraft, including 121 subjects (77 in 1:48 scale and 44 in 1:72). In the mid-1980s, the first signs of market crisis took the modelling industry in a new direction characterized by an increasingly high level in quality of the moulds (mainly the use of emerging technology CAD/CAM); this, combined with advent of the first video games and electronic media quickly shifted the attention of young people. The combination of financing pressures and maintenance of ESCI's impressive catalogue required substantial investments that led to the entrance of a new partner who could give new life to the company. In 1987, the three partners gave a majority stake in the company to Ertl, the American distributor of ESCI kits at the time. The catalogue of 1991 shows a radical downsizing of products, bringing the number of kits to 290. 100 of these were aeroplanes (22 in 1:48 scale and 75 in 1:72 scale). At the end of 1991 CEO Dino Coppola left the company with some employees to found the CDC-Collector Armour Ltd., a company specializing in the production of die cast cars, armoured vehicles, and aircraft, that would be in business until 2001. In 1993, ESCI - ERTL SpA was finally liquidated. Some of the moulds moved to Central America, and others ended up in areas that have become conflict zones, and therefore difficult to recover for future reissues. Ertl moved some moulds to the United States to be used by AMT. Ertl decided to release the best products under the AMT logo, leaving the logo ESCI as products of lower quality and intended for larger distribution. Production moved to Tijuana in Mexico, and later in China and was characterized by the use of very soft plastic that degraded assembly of AMT and ESCI kit reissues. In the 1990s, AMT developed a series of new moulds to model aircraft of World War II. The last official catalog was printed in 1999 by the local Italian distributor, and the few boxes that came to stores went almost completely unnoticed. The same year, economic difficulties at Ertl also led to the sale to Racing Champions. In 2000 the final ESCI moulds were taken by Italeri which today is selling again the best of the old production.  Product range  The early ESCI 1:72 scale aircraft offerings, notably the Mirage F-1, F-104, F-15, F-100, F-16 and F-5 and Sea Harrier kits, were extremely accurate at the time of their manufacture. The F-104 and F-15 Eagle kits were later superseded by other competitors like Hasegawa, but ESCI's line of 1:72 scale F-5, F-100D/F, and Sea Harrier remained, until today, arguably among the best scale replicas ever produced in injection moulded plastic. ESCI's 1:72 Sea Harrier kit is quite exceptional because it has continued to be re-released under many other familiar model brands such as Italeri and Revell. ESCI also produced 1/24 scale vehicles. BMW M1, Renault R5, Lamborghini Miura & Countach, Land Rover 109, Mercedes Benz 450 SLC 5.0, Mercedes 230G (G Wagon) including Rally version Paris Dakar, 190e Cosworth, Lancia Beta, Ferrari 250SWB & 512BB .Most were available in race/rally type. The Mk2 Ford Transit and Mk2 Ford Escort were totally unique to ESCI in the scale and have not been manufactured by any other company although Revell did reproduce the ESCI Ford Escort with different rally liveries which eludes to Revell owning the moulds. ESCI was also noted for releasing 1:72-scale models of Soviet supersonic bombers such as the (Tu-22 and the Tu-22M) during the height of the Cold War era, despite it being a difficult subject to source accurate information and reference material. ESCI became noted for their 1:72 military vehicle line as they were one of the first manufacturers to release an extensive and accurate series in that scale. ESCI's 1:48 aircraft line had below-average accuracy and detailing in spite of the interesting themes (MiG-23, MiG-27) and eye-catching box art. The exception to this are the two crisp models of the famous Henschel ground attack aircraft, the (Hs 123 and the Hs 129). Their World War II line was limited to ground vehicle themes (in 1:72, 1:35, and 1:9 motorbikes). Also several 1:24 cars (factory stock and motorsport) were available with high- finish details.

This model was also offered as a dealer promo, the last ever designed by Jo-Han. Jo-Han was a manufacturer of plastic scale promotional model cars and kits originally based in Detroit. The company was founded in 1947 by tool and die maker John Hanley a year before West Gallogly's competing company AMT was formed and about the same time as PMC. After changing ownership a few times, Jo-Han models were sporadically manufactured by Okey Spaulding in Covington, KY, but apparently none have been offered for several years. Early history Originally called Ideal Models, Hanley's first products were mid-1950s model aircraft and other promotional items. Some of the early projects included scale model kitchen sets and a training model of Chrysler's fluid drive transmission. This awarded Hanley a contract to produce models for Chrysler. During the 1950s, the U.S. automakers were commissioning models of their cars from suppliers that included AMT and Jo-Han. Automobile sales people realized that, as one slogan of the time put it, ‚Äúthe little ones sell the big ones‚Äù. The promise of a free toy car for the kids would entice families into showrooms to view the latest car designs and take them for test drives. Contracts with General Motors soon followed, and Jo-Han produced Pontiac models for the 1955 model year. Over time, Jo-Han became known more for Chrysler models, though Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Studebaker (often Larks), and American Motors were also well represented making Jo-Han a strong competitor to AMT and later to MPC. Oldsmobile and Cadillac models appeared through the 1960s and 1970s, including the 1962 Oldsmobile compact Cutlass F-85. Their last promotional model made was the 1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville. Eventually the company name was changed to Jo-Han Models because of the already existing Ideal Toy Company. The new name reflected the first two letters of the founder's first name and the first three letters of his last name. Similar to how AMT simultaneously used the SMP brand name, Jo-Han's 1955 Pontiac Star Chief two door and four door sedan promotional models also continued to use the Ideal name during the transition, but this was the last year for the Ideal name. Popularity =Golden Age of models and kits= The 1950s and 1960s are considered a \\"golden age\\" for promotional models and kits, with pre-assembled dealer promotionals coming first around 1950, then kits adding profit in the late-1950s. Most kits were known as \\"annuals\\" by hobbyists, and followed the bigger business of promos that represented the new cars introduced at the beginning of each model year. Moreover, model cars were on the forefront of hobbies at that time with a wide range and variety available from numerous manufactures. Companies that made promos for the automakers included JoHan, Revell, Monogram, Lindberg and MPC. The model companies followed up with hundreds of different model cars and trucks for retail markets. The industry expanded as total annual sales of model kits increased from $6 million in 1956 to more than $150 million by 1962. Model car collecting and building were an important part of being an automobile enthusiast in the 1960s. Besides the standard factory built models, plastic kits were available that represented race and custom forms of the original promo editions. =Model details= Though AMT started using non-warping polystyrene plastic as opposed to cellulose acetate on some of their 1961 models, Jo-Han promotional models did not make a total change to styrene until production of their 1964 models. The new styrene held its shape over time. Often, the upward warping of the outward edges of front fenders above a non- warped styrene chrome grille was particularly pronounced on Jo-Han models, and sometimes called the \\"Jo-Han\\" smile. The central chassis from 1966 Toronado - devoid of detail except for the car name. Non-detailing of the chassis saved production money and was common. By this time, AMT and MPC models, by contrast, nearly always had detailed chassis. Emphasizing its promotional quality, the Jo-Han name is not found anywhere on this Toronado. Usually there were no opening features, but Jo-Han plastic models were intricately detailed, with accurate body scripts, trim, and emblems, as well as seat and dashboard highlights. Intricate details would change from year to year according to annual design changes and specifications of the real cars produced. One model expert, and former employee of Jo-Han, Dennis Doty, reported how the company would mix paints to be applied to the models in as near to the same colors as used by the actual manufacturers. One particularly difficult paint to match for the 1977 Cadillacs was Saffron metallic. Thus, normally automobile companies did not supply the actual paints to the promo manufacturers. On most Jo-Han models, especially on friction models, chassis detail was often absent - which lowered tooling expense for a company not quite so large as AMT or the later MPC. Commonly, the chassis base was just an indented slab with the Jo- Han company name and \\"Detroit, Michigan\\", but sometimes the company name was completely absent and only the GM or other car logo was present - emphasizing the real manufacturer instead of Jo-Han, the model maker. Some later contracts, however, added complete chassis detail as seen in the 1970 Ford Maverick, and the Cadillac Coupe DeVille and Eldorado promotionals from the later 1970s. On the 1965 and 1966 full sized Chrysler promos, Jo-Han outdid themselves by offering working torsion bars, but these were dropped for 1967 Apart from the often plain chassis, models were exact duplicates of the real thing in 1/25 scale. Wheels also carried accurate detail, including authentic and official logos and scripts in hubcap centers. =Marketing and model variety= Through the 1950s, the promo business was of primary importance to the model makers. Jo-Han and others also offered their models in more simplified form to dime-stores like G. C. Murphy's or Zayre's. These offerings were less likely to have official Big 3 paint schemes or the dealer boxes and were often seen with friction motors added for play value. Many promos, like the 1967-1968 Imperial were offered as promos and as frictions, but not seen in kit form. Jo-Han models were especially popular through the 1960s, offering some of the most accurately detailed scale replicas available in plastic. Detroit's offerings were well represented by the company in both kit and dealer \\"promo\\" form. While most products were Chrysler, AMC, and GM, some Fords that AMT did not have did make their way to Jo-Han such as the Ford Maverick and Gran Torino in their introductory years (1970 and 1972). The Maverick was available molded in at least five colors: medium green, dusty rose (kind of a rosy gray), butterscotch, light blue, and red. The Maverick was often available in magazines like National Geographic offered for free or limited cost just by cutting out, completing and mailing in the ad. As promotions for Ford, the ads did not mention Jo-Han. Jo-Han promo boxes took a variety of forms. One of the most often seen in the early 1960s was a red, white and blue striped box with a clear plastic window in the shape of a car body. Later, X-El Products boxes, like later MPC ones, were simple white boxes with names stamped on the end flaps. Both AMT and Jo-Han introduced 1/25 scale NASCAR race car models to \\"a hungry modeling public.\\" The Jo-Han kits featured \\"frame-pac\\" construction that arranged the parts trees in the box in a way to prevent the parts from rubbing against each other. As the promotional model business tapered off in the 1970s, it became financially difficult for Jo-Han to develop new tooling. The last new model was of the 1977 Cadillac, which was continued as both the 1978 and 1979 Coupe deVille in promo and snap-kit form. =Chrysler Turbine car= The 1963 Chrysler Turbine Car was an experimental gas turbine-powered coupe of which 55 were made. The \\"Ghia\\" Turbines (as they were often known internally because of the Italian styling shop's production of the bodies) were put into the hands of only 203 real customers for testing and PR goodwill. This was a particular boon for Jo-Han which was chosen to make the plastic promotional. Tooling for the model cost at least $250,000 at the time and Chrysler completely underwrote the expense. As with most promotional models, the car was to be supplied to Chrysler dealers and given to the best customer prospects - though not for the Turbine car itself - the 50 produced (five being test vehicles) were not for sale.Lehto, p. 68. Boxes of twelve to twenty-four of the models were often left with the families who used the car.Lehto, pp. 89, 101. The bronze metallic promotional models (with black vinyl roofs) were also distributed to attendees at Chrysler's pavilion in the 1964 New York World's Fair. Two kit versions of the Chrysler Turbine Car were significant - a standard bronze colored promotional authentic to the cars used by the public, and a white version that was the color of one of the test mules, which was also lent for the making of the movie The Lively Set. This model had a friction motor and fewer than 500 were produced. Some of the Turbine models were nearly as incredible as the real car, with such details as folding seats, opening doors, hood, deck lid, and steerable front wheels.* Chassis detail was remarkable, accurately depicting the huge ducting passages running the length of the car needed to expel the turbine's waste gasses. Later, in the 1980s and 1990s the standard Ghia turbine was reproduced both as a kit and a simple promotional - sans moving parts. In the mid-1980s, X-EL Products, still sold the Jo-Han Chrysler Turbine model. In 1992, 1,000 special Chrysler Ghia Turbine models were produced in black, a color the real car was never painted. The original packaging of the model showed the car from various angles and a photo of the turbine engine on the box. An explanation of turbine power in general was written on the box, with an emphasis that it was important that a gas turbine engine \\"be made from low-cost readily available materials\\" even though the engine was in actuality fairly expensive compared to conventional piston driven internal combustion engines.Lehto, p. 90. Further, the box spoke of the flexibility of the engine in its ability to use a variety of different types of fuels and Chrysler encouraged those in possession of the model to \\"watch\\" for the real car, which \\"will soon be on the streets and highways of America\\". =American Motors= American Motors Corporation was a common client of Jo-Han, producing mainly 1/25 scale promo models. 1959 and 1960 Rambler station wagons were produced by Jo-Han. These were not offered in kit form - but the demand was not as great for station wagon kits. These were later re-issued by X-El Products and Okey Spaulding in the 1990s and early 2000s. Though perhaps not as collectible, the later issues were made in non-warping styrene plastic. The company also made Rambler Classic sedans and American convertibles for 1963-1965, however, the 1962 through 1964 versions were of a slightly larger 1:24 scale, apparently AMC wanted them that way. Also interesting is that both the dealer promo and the dimestore versions of these Classics came with friction motors - as usually the promo versions did not. One AMC model of interest was a detailed promotional for the 1965 and 1966 AMC Marlin fastbacks - a dramatic new variation on the Classic. The two year's models differ in their grilles and the removal of the Rambler name on the 1966 version. A friction model was also available for the 1966 Marlin. The promos were finished in a variety of single and two-tone color combinations according to factory available hues. One common color was light turquoise molded plastic with roof and rear fastback deck colored AMC metallic blue-green. As the 1966 model year neared its end and all-new cars for 1967 were being introduced, AMC dealers contributed thousands of leftover Marlin promos to institutions such as children's hospitals and orphanages. The 1966 promos are now desirable and they command premium prices. Value for an individual model can be $200 to $400 for mint, in-the-box specimens with hood ornament intact. Jo-Han also produced 1/25-scale plastic kits of the 1966 Marlin, (Jo-Han # C1900) and it was reissued in the mid-1970s in the \\"U.S.A. Oldies\\" series (Jo-Han # C-3666). They are based on the promotional models, but are less valuable today. Steve Magnante of Hot Rod wrote that these unassembled model kits are increasing in value. An example of the rush of plastic model suppliers to produce promos for the next model year was seen in the Jo-Han 1968 AMC Ambassador convertible, a car never manufactured in reality because AMC discontinued the convertible body style from the Ambassador line after the 1967 model year. Oddly, though, Jo-Han's Ambassador promo led to one of the few kits that Jo-Han made that was not offered as a promo first. This was the 1970 Rebel Machine. An insert could be taken out of the Ambassador promo chassis to make the shorter wheelbase models like the Rebel - which was the case here. =Jo-Han Classics= A bit less well known were the Classic series of 1:25 scale vehicles offered by Jo- Han. These were cars of the 1930s like the 1931 Cadillac in Town Brougham, Phaeton or Cabriolet, the 1934 Mercedes-Benz 540K in cabriolet or hard top limousine. Though as detailed as any classic model line from any manufacturer, the Classic line did not endure long and was limited to only a few offerings.Consumer Guide p. 17. Decline A decrease in demand for promotionals occurred through the 1970s. Earlier hobbies of America's youth such as model building and bicycle riding were gradually replaced by video games, home movies, iPods and the Internet. Still, Jo-Han made several models, such as the 1972 Ford Torino that the company made in promo form. This model was reissued in 1976 as a snap-kit in both stock and NASCAR versions. Jo-Han was also the last of the promotional producers to make models with a friction motor. Jo-Han limped through the 1980s re-issuing old kits and promos. The company gave up trying to retail its models and set up a branch company called X-El Products to sell reissued promos. The X-El reissues have sometimes been passed off as originals in antique malls and flea markets. The X-El Products era was an ironic time. Models were carefully prepared and respected by collectors, but there was no capital to develop new products, so the company fell into decline. One consumer purchase update card sent by X-El Products to buyers in 1988 encouraged patience when waiting for models that were ordered, saying, \\"These promos are not done on a mass production basis. They are practically made to order and babied from start to finish.\\" This is another way of saying that Jo-Han did not have the resources to improve their service. Nevertheless, the reproductions from this time have also escalated in collector value and were as well rendered as the original period promos, done with accurate color schemes. In 1991, the company was purchased by Seville Enterprises, a manufacturer of plastic parts for the auto industry. Seville, at one time located in Romeo, Michigan, once again offered some kits and promos, mainly by mail order, from original Jo-Han dies. A few one-off paint combinations were also known to have been created by Seville during these years. Plans to produce an all-new GM-approved promotional of the new 1992 Cadillac Seville STS were soon scrapped, however due to lack of funding for the tooling required. In 2000, Jo-Han was purchased from the ailing Seville by Mr. Okey Spaulding, a resin parts producer from Covington, Kentucky. A new company, JoHan Models LLC (without the traditional hyphen) was formed. Through about 2005, Spaulding produced a few of the original models in limited quantities, including the 1956 Plymouth, 1959 Rambler station wagon, some 1950s Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs. For a one-man operation, Spaulding's attention to detail could be remarkable and he sold models through his website for a time.Doty, 2004, pp86-87. Spaulding apparently still sells parts, and as of 2010 all sales were done through the site emodelcars.com, but no models have been listed there for many years.

VEB Plasticart produced around 40 different kits and a few games (e.g. the mancala game \\"Badari\\") made of plastic. Most kits were static models and used scale 1/100 for airliners, 1/50 and later 1/72 for smaller aircraft. They also produced a model of the Soviet spaceship Vostok (scaled 1/25) and the Energia rocket with the Soviet space shuttle Buran (1/288). Many of them are today valued collector items.  History  VEB Plasticart was established in 1958 in Zschopau, East Germany. VEB (Volkseigener Betrieb) was a Communist- era designation, meaning \\"company owned by the people\\". The company was called KVZ from 1958-1969, MPKAB from 1969-1973, VEB Plasticart Zschopau from 1973-1989 and Mastermodell GmbH from 1989-1991. After a two-years break the company was sold in 1993 by the German Treuhand (an organization which privatized state owned enterprises of the GDR) to Manfred Wader. It is today called Plasticart. In 1993 the company had only 37 workers left. A new factory was constructed in Elterlein, Saxony, and now the company counts over 70 workers. They no longer make kits, but playthings for toddlers. In late 2012 German company Reifra has resumed production of the some former Plasticalt model kits. The \\"VEB\\" title was applied to a range of small semi-autonomous businesses in the GDR that made goods especially for export. The GDR needed to export as much as possible to earn foreign \\"hard\\" currency as its own \\"soft\\" Ostmark was not freely convertible and could only be obtained and used within the GDR. Consequently, VEB Plasticart was able to sell cheap, but well designed, plastic construction kits to the Western countries in exchange for much-needed Western currencies. The factory was located in August-Bebel Strasse 2, 936 Zschopau, German Democratic Republic. For a long time the name \\"VEB\\" has stood with modelers for plastic construction kits from East Germany. The company changed its name several times. ;KVZ (\\"VEB Kunststoff-Verarbeitung Zschopau\\"): This name lasted until 1969 and is translated as \\"Plastic Processing Zschopau\\". The kits had very nice packaging, usually made of thicker cardboard and a great cover image. The company logo was at that time the snake. ;MPKAB (\\"VEB Modell -und Plastspielwaren Kombinat Annaberg- Buchholz\\"): This very long name was used from 1969-1973 and stands for \\"VEB model and plastic toys combine Annaberg-Buchholz\\". The kits of this period, were packed in the classic familiar blue standard boxes, but, no company logo. :In this era the combined company released 1:87 scale die-cast car and military vehicle models. \\"ESPEWE MODELLE\\" logo was used on the package.Small Scale World, March 11, 2009 ;VEB Kombinat Plasticart Annaberg-Buchholz: This name was used for die-cast vehicle models. \\"PLASTICART modelle\\" logo was used on the package. ;VEB Plasticart Zschopau: That was the last name as \\"VEB\\" from 1973 to 1989, the packaging was the same as from 1969/70 but from 1973 they then received a company logo. From 1987, some kits appeared in a very novel black box, with a picture of a constructed model on the cover. ;Mastermodell GmbH: From 1989 to 1991 they were produced as a limited company under that name. In addition to these company names, two more brand names were used by UK importers: \\"Playfix\\" from the mid-1980s and \\"Nu-Bee\\" from the early 1990s.John W. Burns, The Collectors Value Guide for Scale Model Plastic Kits, Sixth Edition, 1994, P.134 and P.142  Products  Starting in a modest way with an Ilyushin Il-14 airliner in HO scale, then dabbling in the odd 1/40th scale for an Aero 45 twin engine low wing monoplane Plasticart soon progressed to something more ambitious, a scale model of the first jet turbine airliner to be produced by the GDR. This was the extraordinary Baade 152, the last development in a line of aircraft that sprung from the former Junkers works in Leipzig and Dresden (both then in the GDR). Next up was the stalwart of Interflug's European network, the four-engined Ilyushin IL-18 turboprop. The first of the famous Soviet airliner series to appear, in 1963, was the Tupolev Tu-104, the first medium haul jet aircraft to go into regular sustained airline service. The early Plasticart Tu-104 set the standard for all the kits that followed. It was scaled at 1:100 which whilst not common for aircraft kits at the time, was close to FROG models' 1:96 scale and matched well with contemporary East German TT trains such as Berliner Bahn. In addition, the kit set a standard for being simple to assemble, with a minimal number of parts, sturdy landing gear and a full decal sheet. Instructions were a let-down though ‚Äì often printed in German, Russian, Polish and Czech, these were aimed squarely at consumers in the Comecon countries, where Plasticart kits were both affordable and plentiful. There was an exploded diagram, but no English instructions. Because the drawings were easy to obtain, Plasticart began to introduce a comprehensive range of detailed models of Soviet airliners and other Warsaw Pact aircraft. Whilst the Tu-104 had only been available with Aeroflot markings, the new introductions mostly came with Interflug decals ‚Äì markings of the state airline of the GDR. The latest airliners soon made it into the range, including the Tupolev Tu-134, Tu-154, Ilyushin's Il-62 long range airliner, the Antanov design bureau's An-24 twin engine short hauled feeder-liner and the Czech-built Let L-410 Turbolet twin prop commuter aircraft. Later additions included the remarkable Yakovlev Yak-40 tri-jet short-haul \\"hot & high\\" jet and the awesome Tu-144 supersonic jet, known by NATO as the Charger or as \\"Concordski\\" more generally. A very interesting mix of Soviet fighter aircraft and especially, helicopters, was also produced including the giant Mil Mi-10 flying crane and the famous MiG-21 \\"Fishbed\\" (1/100) and Sukhoi Su-7 \\"Fitter\\" fighters (1/72 scale). But it is the Western airliners that are most sought after by collectors today. The eclectic choice commenced with a very large kit indeed, the Douglas DC-8-54 series. The DC-8 was in early KLM stripes livery and is today very sought after. It was subsequently re-issued with an updated KLM decal sheet. One of the most pleasing box arts was completed for the De Havilland DH106 Comet 4 airliner, depicted departing from Hong Kong Kai Tak airport. Full BOAC decals are included. The SE210 Caravelle was also released in this era, in the markings of a French prototype destined for Air France. Then the Boeing 727-100 got the Plasticart treatment with good box art in Pan-Am colours. Plasticart then added the Hawker Siddeley Trident initially in British European Airways colours, but later in British Airways livery, and then the unsuccessful Dassault Mercure of which only 11 units were built, all going to French domestic airline Air Inter. Later models, such as the 1/72 scale Junkers G23/24 tri-motor corrugated aluminium airliner were detailed and well moulded. Western fighter jets also made an appearance with the introduction of the delta-wing Saab Draken in 1/100 to complement the MiG-21. Along with the aircraft and helicopter kits, VEB Plasticart also produced a model of the first manned spaceship Vostok 3KA (1/25) and the Soviet Energia rocket with Buran (1/288). The Vostok kit is almost the same size as Revell's Vostok, and the box artwork is also very similar, but the two are completely different. Revell's Vostok is actually 1/24 scale and it was initially released in the late 1960s.Revell Catalog 1969 =List of Plastic Models= Civil aircraft (Eastern) *Ilyushin Il-14 \\"Crate\\" (1/87) 1958 *Aero 45 (1/50) 1959 *Dresden Baade 152 (1/100) 1960 *Ilyushin Il-18 \\"Coot\\" (1/100) 1961 *Antonov An-2 \\"Colt\\" (1/75) 1962 *Antonov An-12 \\"Cub\\" (1/100) 1963 *Tupolev Tu-104 \\"Camel\\" (1/100) 1963 *Tupolev Tu-114 \\"Cleat\\" (1/100) 1963 *Tupolev Tu-134 \\"Crusty\\" (1/100) 1963 *Aero L-60 Brigad√Ωr (1/100) 1965 *Ilyushin Il-62 \\"Classic\\" (1/100) 1965 *Yakovlev Yak-40 \\"Codling\\" (1/100) 1967 *Tupolev Tu-144 \\"Charger\\" (1/100) 1969 *Tupolev Tu-154 \\"Careless\\" (1/100) 1973 *Let L-410 Turbolet (1/100) 1975 *Antonov An-24 \\"Coke\\" (1/100) 1975 *Antonov An-14 \\"Clod\\" (1/72) 1988 Civil aircraft (Western) *Douglas DC-8-54 (1/100) 1963 *Sud Aviation SE210 Caravelle (1/100) 1963 *de Havilland DH106 Comet-4 (1/100) 1964 *Boeing 727-100 (1/100) 1968 *Hawker-Siddeley HS121 Trident 2 (1/100) 1973 *Dassault Mercure (1/100) 1975 *Junkers G23/24 (1/72) 1987 Military aircraft *Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-15 \\"Fagot\\" (1/50) *Ilyushin Il-28 \\"Beagle\\" (1/100) 1970 *Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-21 \\"Fishbed\\" (1/100) 1973 *Saab J35 Draken (1/100) 1973 *Sukhoi Su-7 \\"Fitter\\" (1/72) 1973 *Tupolev Tu-20/95 \\"Bear\\" (1/100) 1975 *Beriev Be-6 \\"Madge\\" (1/72) 1975 *Tupolev Tu-2 \\"Bat\\" (1/72) 1977 Helicopters *Mil Mi-1 \\"Hare\\" (1/100) 1967 *Mil Mi-4 \\"Hound\\" (1/100) 1967 *Mil Mi-6 \\"Hook\\" (1/87) 1967 *Mil Mi-10K \\"Harke\\" (1/100) 1968 *Yakovlev Yak-24P \\"Horse\\" (1/100) 1968 Spacecraft *Vostok 3KA (1/25) *Energia/Buran (1/288) 1988  References  * Plasticart - Scale modeling sets from the GDR (in German) * VEB Plasticart collector and modelling (in Romanian) * Plasticart Models (in Russian)  External links  * reifra KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GmbH (in German) - Successor of VEB Plasticalt Category:Model manufacturers of Germany Category:Toy brands Category:Volkseigene Betriebe Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1958 Category:1958 establishments in East Germany ","title":"VEB Plasticart"},{"id":"6641785","text":"Harald Winkler (born 17 December 1962) is an Austrian bobsledder who competed in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

A. Kerkut) (19 August 1927 ‚Äì 6 March 2004) was a noted British zoologist and physiologist. Career He attended the University of Cambridge from 1945 to 1952 and earned a doctorate in zoology. He went on to establish the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry at University of Southampton where he remained throughout his career. He became Professor of Physiology and Biochemistry in 1966 and went on to become the Dean of Science, Chairman of the School of Biochemical and Physiological Sciences and Head of the Department of Neurophysiology. Controversy Kerkut's book The Implications of Evolution pointed out some existing unsolved problems and points of concern for evolutionary studies. He referred to seven evolutionary assumptions which he felt lacked sufficient evidentiary support.Bonner, John Tyler. (1961). Implications of Evolution by G. A. Kerkut. American Scientist. Vol. 49, No. 2, pp. 240-244.Nursall, J. R. (1961). Implications of Evolution by G. A. Kerkut. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 36, No. 4. pp. 284-285.Anonymous. (1962). Implications of Evolution by G. A. Kerkut. The American Biology Teacher. Vol. 24, No. 4, p. 290. Kerkut concludes his 1960 book with the statement \\"It is not clear whether the changes that bring about speciation are of the same nature as those that brought about the development of new phyla. The answer will be found by future experimental work and not by dogmatic assertions that the General Theory of Evolution must be correct because there is nothing else that will satisfactorily take its place.\\". Biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky took issue with Kerkut's statements about evolution Dobzhansky, Theodosius. (1961). Implications of Evolution by G. A. Kerkut. Science. New Series, Vol. 133, No. 3455. p. 752. where he comments ‚ÄúThe basic conclusion of the author is, however, something else - since we cannot yet reconstruct in all of the details the phylogeny of the animal kingdom, therefore, evolution is not ‚Äúproven‚Äù! This is a confusion of two distinct problems; we may be sure that life (or, for that matter, the Cosmos) had a history, but it does not follow that we know all the events of which these histories are composed, with their respective dates. The author has been wise not to suggest any alternatives to the theory of evolution...‚Äù. The book has also been criticized for inadequately describing the fossil evidence for evolution.S, H. H. (1961). Implications of Evolution by G. A. Kerkut. Science Progress. Vol. 49, No. 194, pp. 381-382. Botanist Elwood B. Ehrle in a review has noted: :[Kerkut] apparently makes the mistake of assuming that the case for evolution rests on the documentation of a monophyletic development of the animal kingdom-indeed, of all life. Even if it should be conceded that polyphylesis is the rule rather than the exception, the fact of evolution remains in crystalline clarity.Ehrle, Elwood B. (1963). Implications of Evolution by G. A. Kerkut. Evolution. Vol. 17, No. 3. p. 372. Creationists have taken Kerkut's points as evidence against evolution and interpreted them to support their own claims.Bruce A. Demarest, Gordon R. Lewis (1996) Fossil Groupings and Gaps p. 54 in Integrative Theology, Zondervan, In his book, Kerkut distinguished between the Special Theory of Evolution (often referred to as microevolution) and what he termed the General Theory of Evolution (often referred to as macroevolution, but also including abiogenesis).Bert Thompson (1985) Is Evolution a ‚ÄúFact‚Äù of Science?

The highway is primarily rural, avoiding larger cities such as Raleigh. NC 42 begins at I-73/I-74/US 220 on the western side of Asheboro. From there the highway runs southeast toward Sanford. Running through the heart of Sanford, NC 42 intersects several major highways such as US 1 and US 421\\\\. Leaving Sanford the highway runs along the southern side of the Triangle Area, while servicing the smaller towns of Fuquay-Varina and Clayton. Further east the highway intersects both I-95 and US 264, shortly before entering into central Wilson. Leaving Wilson the highway continues to the northeast, and intersects US 258 near Crisp. North of intersecting US 64, NC 42 begins a concurrency with NC 11 from Hassell to western Ahoskie. Nearing Ahoskie the highway turns to the east and runs south of the center of the town. NC 42 follows concurrently with US 13 southeast to Powellsville. Nearing its eastern terminus the highway turns east along its own routing until reaching NC 45 in Colerain where the highway ends. NC 42 is the third longest state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. NC 42 was established as an original state highway running from NC 133 north of Wilson to NC 12 in Pinetops. Between 1934 and 1935 NC 42 was extended twice, first to NC 23 south of Emit, and then to US 15A west of McCullers. The western terminus of the highway was moved in 1948 to US 15A (Now US-401) in Fuquay-Varina, placing NC 42 on its modern routing south of Raleigh. Four years later, NC 42's eastern terminus was extended to US 64 in Conetoe. In 1960 the highway was extended to US 421 east of Sanford. However, in 1963 NC 42 was routed concurrently with US 421 through Sanford before following its own routing to NC 22\\\\. The highway then followed NC 22 to the northwest, and replaced NC 902 between Coleridge and Asheboro. The same year, NC 42 was extended along new routing through Hassell, ending at NC 125 south of Hamilton. The last major change to NC 42 was in 1976, when the highway was routed along NC 11 and US 13 through Ahoskie and then replaced NC 350 to NC 45 in Colerain. Route description =Asheboro to Sanford= NC 42 begins at I-73/I-74/US 220 west of central Asheboro. The highway begins by moving east along Salisbury Street toward downtown. NC 42 briefly parallels, and later crosses a railroad operated by Norfolk Southern. Just north of the central business district, NC 42 crosses US 220 Business (Fayetteville Street), and moves into a residential area of eastern Asheboro. Briefly before intersecting Coleridge Road/Dublin Square Road, NC 42 bears to the southeast towards US 64\\\\. At the US 64 (Dixie Drive) intersection, NC 42 briefly widens to a four lane road. Moving southeast, the highway runs alongside of several rural neighborhoods on the outskirts of town. After intersecting Iron Mountain Road, NC 42 begins to parallel Squirrel Creek to the east. More farms and rural houses appear as the highway moves away from the neighborhoods along the highway. After Woodhaven Drive, NC 42 begins a slow turn to the east which it completes before reaching Old North Highway 13. The highway continues due east until reaching Hinshaw Town Road, where NC 42 bears to the southeast. Between Little Beane Store Road and Tommy Cox Road, NC 42 makes a turn toward the northeast as it heads toward Coleridge. Entering into Coleridge the highway makes a turn due east briefly before crossing the Deep River. Several houses are found to the north of NC 42 while the Deep River runs along the southern side. NC 42 meets NC 22 near the center of Coleridge, and the highway turns to the southeast to follow concurrently alongside the road. For the highway follows adjacent to the Deep River, before the river turns due south. NC 42 continues to follow NC 22 for . The route is mainly rural, however NC 22/NC 42 pass to the west of Bennett. The highway also serves as the western terminus of NC 902 approximately north of the NC 42 split. At Charlie Garner Road, NC 42 turns to the due east toward Sanford. Between Siler City-Glendon Road and Indian Creek Estates, the highway makes several turns towards the northeast, before moving back toward the southeast. The highway runs through the center of the unincorporated community of Carbonton at an intersection with Goldston Carbonton Road. Immediately after leaving Carbonton, the highway once again crosses the Deep River, and NC 42 turns back due east along Carbonton Road. Most farms give way to forests between Plank Road and Steel Bridge Road west of Sanford. After passing Steel Bridge Road, the road name changes to Wicker Street and NC 42 enters into a residential area. =Sanford to Clayton= After an interchange with US 15/US 501, NC 42 continues northeast along Wicker Street into Sanford. Until reaching Carthage Street the area is mostly residential, however as the road continues east more commercial buildings are found roadside. In downtown Sanford, NC 42 turns to the south along US 421 Business (South Horner Boulevard), exiting the downtown area. The highway passes under a railroad operated by CSX Transportation and the turns toward the southeast. The four lane highway enters into a primarily commercial area until NC 42 turns off at Main Street. After crossing a railroad operated by Atlantic and Western Railroad, the highway moves from a commercial area to a primarily residential area. After Rosser Road, the road name changes from Main Street to Broadway Road. NC 42 meets US 421/NC 87 Bypass as it exits Sanford to the east. The highway passes by East Lee Middle School, along with several warehouses and a mobile home park all before leaving Sanford. NC 42 bears off along Avents Ferry Road to the northeast running toward Corinth. After intersecting Buck Horn Road, NC 42 begins a slow turn due north, however the highway begins a turn back to the northeast briefly before intersecting Poplar Springs Church Road. As NC 42 continues northeast, the highway crosses over the Cape Fear River. Avents Ferry Road meets with Corinth Road to the southwest of the town, and NC 42 turns right to follow Corinth Road to the northeast. As NC 42 enters into the small community of Corinth, several houses appear alongside the highway. However, as the highway makes a slow turn to the southeast, the houses give way to forests alongside Harris Lake. NC 42 passes over a railroad operated by Norfolk Southern, briefly before the highway turns directly south. The highway makes several turns toward the northeast, routing the highway toward Duncan. Entering into the area around Duncan, several small farms appear alongside the road. NC 42 also turns toward the east to run through the heart of Duncan. Leaving Duncan to the east, NC 42 once again crosses the railroad operated by Norfolk Southern, however this time at an at- grade crossing. NC 42 turns to the northeast along Academy Street, and runs adjacent to several fields along with several rural neighborhoods. By the time the highway intersects Judd Parkway, the fields disappear into a strictly residential area. Just before entering into the downtown area, the highway once again crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway. In downtown Fuquay-Varina, NC 42 turns to the north and follows US 401 (Main Street) towards Raleigh. Main Street turns to the east, paralleling the adjacent railroad. US 401/NC 42 meets up with NC 55 (Ennis Street) in a commercial area along the northern side of town. NC 42 continues to follow concurrently with US 401 and NC 55 for , until both NC 42 and NC 55 bear off to the south. NC 42 and NC 55 stay concurrent for until NC 42 bears off to the southeast. The highway continues to run toward the east, with multiple neighborhoods and farms adjacent to the highway. NC 42 meets up with NC 50 in a rural area near Cleveland. Through Cleveland, the route serves as the main commercial district through the rapidly growing suburban area of northern Johnston County. The highway turns to the northeast, before entering a commercial area near the I-40 interchange. East of that interchange, NC 42 crosses Swift Creek and meets up with US 70 at exit 320. As the highway nears Clayton, its passes to the south of a hospital and then moves into a residential area. =Clayton to Wilson= NC 42 enters into Clayton from the west along Lombard Street. Past Guy Road, several commercial stores are located adjacent to the highway, along with an elementary school. The highway meets US 70 Business at an incomplete interchange southwest of downtown Clayton. Westbound NC 42 follows Barbour and Hamby Streets before intersecting Lombard Street. NC 42 turns to the east to follow along US 70 Business. The two highways follow concurrently for before NC 42 bears northeast along its own four lane highway. The highway bears further to the east before passing by several research and industrial buildings. After Glen Laurel Road, the highway narrows down from four lanes to a two lane road. As the highway continues east, it crosses the Neuse River, another elementary school along with multiple residential developments. Most of the neighborhoods dissipate as NC 42 crosses Buffalo Road, turning into forests and farms. NC 42 intersects NC 96 southwest of the unincorporated community of Jordan. after intersecting NC 96, NC 42 intersects NC 39 and turns toward the northeast, before making another slight turn to the east. Continuing east, NC 42 meets NC 222 and the highway's share a brief concurrency. From there, NC 42 and Little Creek begin to parallel each other. Several accesses to Buckhorn Reservoir are located along the northern side of NC 42\\\\. Just past the reservoir, NC 42 meets up with NC 581, and begins a turn to the northeast to parallel I-95. NC 42 makes a slight turn to the east and meets up with I-95 at exit 116. Past I-95, NC 42 becomes a four lane divided highway. The highway meets up with I-795/US 264 at exit 40 west of Wilson where you can see the beautiful Wilson skyline. NC 42 makes a turn to the northeast before turning back to the east and entering into Wilson from the east. =Wilson to Ahoskie= NC 42 enters into Wilson along Tarboro Street. Up to Forest Hills Road, the surrounding area is a mix of farms and residential housing, however after intersecting the road, the landscape turns into commercial buildings. The road passes by Wilson Medical Center along with a shopping center before intersecting US 264 Alternative at Ward Boulevard. At the Ward Boulevard intersection, NC 42 turns left to follow along the road to the north. After intersecting Parkwood Boulevard West, most of the stores fade away to a residential section of northwest Wilson. US 264 Alternate breaks away to the west at Raleigh Road Parkway. Continuing on Ward Boulevard, NC 42 makes a turn to the northeast before intersecting NC 58 at Nash Street. The highway turns directly west, running along the northern side of the Brentwood neighborhood. After intersecting Tilghman Road, the highway takes another right turn toward the southeast, now running along the eastern side of Wilson. Passing by Tosinot Reservoir to the west, the highway turns due south. Ward Boulevard and Raleigh Road Parkway meet again, at a T-Intersection. NC 42/NC 58 and Ward Boulevard all turn to the left to head to the southeast. NC 42 turns left at Herring Avenue, where the highway runs to the east. The residential neighborhoods surrounding the road quickly fade to farms and several large factories which are situated on the outside of the town. The highway meets US 301 at an interchange on the far eastern side of Wilson, before heading east-southeast. After passing to the north of the residential community of Larkspur, the highway begins a slow turn to the northeast towards Pinetops. Approaching the unincorporated community of Wilbanks, several houses and churches appear adjacent to the highway. The highway turns due east, immediately before reaching NC 124\\\\. At the intersection, NC 42 turns and continues to the northeast. Approaching Pinetops, the highway intersects NC 111 before entering the town to the west. NC 42 enters into a residential area of western Pinetops along Hamlet Street. After Fifth Street, NC 42 enters into more of the commercial center of the town and passes by several stores. At Third Street, NC 42 intersects NC 43, and the two highway begins running concurrently to the east. Leaving the center of Pinetops, the highway passes by several more stores and an elementary school before reentering a residential zone on the western side of the town. After intersecting Bynum Farm Road, the highway turns to the southeast and enters into a rural area with mostly farms and small forests. Between Matts Lane and Vinesdale Road the highway makes a turn due east before intersecting US 258\\\\. Continuing east, the highway intersects the eastern terminus of NC 124, immediately before NC 43 bears off to the southeast. The highway turns to the northeast through the unincorporated community of Old Sparta. Crossing the Tar River, NC 42 continues for before reaching NC 33\\\\. The highway continues east-northeast passing multiple fields and crossing several creeks before reaching Conetoe. Nearing Conetoe, the highway turns due east, before turning to the northeast entering into the town limits along Church Street. Church Street runs through a residential area of the town and crosses a railroad operated by CSX Transportation. NC 42 meets US 64 Alternate (Canal Street) on the northeastern side of town, before exiting to the east. The highway makes a general turn to the northeast after intersecting Vine Lane and also enters into a forested area as it approaches US 64\\\\. The highway crosses Conetoe Creek before meeting up with US 64 at exit 494. The highway continues northeast through a mix of small forests and farms, and makes several curves to the north and east. NC 42 meets up with NC 142 west of Hassell. NC 142 follows concurrently along NC 42, as the highway makes a turn due east and meets up with NC 11\\\\. At the intersection NC 42 turns left to follow along NC 11 to the north, while NC 142 continues east towards Hassell. The two highways follow concurrently to the north-northwest towards Oak City. Before reaching the northern terminus of NC 111 in Oak City, the highways turn to the east-northeast. Entering into Oak City, the highway runs along the northern border of the town with homes along the southern side of the road and farms along the northern side. NC 11/NC 42 meet up with NC 125 on the northwest side of town, before exiting to the northeast. Between Oak City and the NC 903 intersection, the highway makes a general turn further east, however makes a turn back to the northeast immediately before reaching the highway. After the intersection, nearly all the farms dissipate into forests, and the highway continues running northeast. The highway crosses the Roanoke River before turning nearly due north. The highway makes several small turns further northeast before reaching the town of Lewiston Woodville. The highway bypasses the main part of the town to the east, with only a few houses, and several small stores found alongside the road. NC 11/NC 42 meet up with NC 308 at Church Street however quickly exit the town to the north. Between Lewiston Woodville and Aulander, the highway is relatively straight, making only one turn to the northeast briefly before passing the Luella community. South of Aulander the highway meets up with NC 11 Business, which runs to the west of its parent route through Aulander and along old NC 350. The highway doesn't ever enter into the town limits of Aulander, instead it bypasses the town to the east. It meets up with NC 305 at Commerce Street, where several houses are found adjacent to the intersection, however the highway continues through mostly forests and small farms. Northeast of the unincorporated community of Millennium, the highway meets up with the northern terminus of NC 11 Business. The highway then turns further to the east toward Ahoskie. Nearing the town, the highway turns north to briefly parallel Knee Branch, before NC 42 breaks off of NC 11, turning to the east. Continuing east, the highway runs adjacent to several rural residential neighborhoods west of town. The highway turns northeast and crosses Ahoskie Creek before entering the town limits. =Ahoskie to Colerain= NC 42 enters the town on the southwestern side, following along Academy Street. Southwest of the central business district of Ahoskie, the highway meets up with US 13/NC 561 (Memorial Drive). At the intersection, NC 42 turns right to follow concurrently along US 13/NC 561 to the east-southeast. Memorial Drive continues through predominately residential area, until reaching Catherine Creek Road, where many more small stores are found adjacent to the highway. After passing a shopping center, NC 561 breaks off to the east toward Harrellsville. US 13/NC 42 turn further to the south before leaving the town limits of Ahoskie. As the highway continues to the southeast, the landscape changes back to mostly forests and farmland, however multiple houses are found along the segment between Ahoskie and Powellsville. The highway turns even further to the south after intersecting Creekside Drive. Once again, the highway crosses over Ashokie Creek, before nearing Powellsville. NC 42 breaks off of US 13 to the northeast of Powellsville and runs southeast along Main Street into town. The surrounding area is mostly residential with very few stores adjacent to the highway. After intersecting Commerce Street, NC 42 passes by both the town hall and the post office in Powellsville. The highway continues southeast along Main Street and passes a school before leaving the town. Even after leaving the town limits, the area alongside the highway remains rural residential until reaching Rockpile Road where most of the homes stop. NC 42 continues to the east-southeast through a very rural area with only a few small farms alongside the road. The highway crosses over and passes by several swamps as it runs toward Colerain. Nearing the town, the highway dips further to the south and then gradually turns back to the northeast. The highway turns nearly due east as it enters town along River Street. The remaining is mostly residential with several stores near the highways eastern terminus. NC 42 ends at NC 45 just north of the central business district of Colerain. History NC 42 was first dedicated in 1922 as a modest connector from Wilson to Pinetops. In the 1930s and 40s it was extended west to Clayton, and by 1950 it reached Fuquay-Varina. In the late 50s, early 60s it was extended in both directions to Conetoe in the east and Asheboro to the west. The last extension came in 1990 to meet with the I-73/I-74/US 220 freeway in Asheboro.

Butler Library's Reference Hall Butler Library is located on the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University at 535 West 114th Street, in Manhattan, New York City. It is the university's largest single library with over 2million volumes, as well as one of the largest buildings on the campus. The Neoclassical style (Stripped Classicism) building was built in 1931‚Äì1934 to a design by James Gamble Rogers.  History  Butler was built in 1931‚Äì1934 and was designed by James Gamble Rogers in the Neoclassical style. The new library was funded by Edward Harkness, a Columbia alumnus who was also donor of Yale's residential college system and Harvard's houses. Originally called \\"South Hall\\", in 1946 it was renamed for Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University from 1902‚Äì1945. Butler first proposed a new library building when plans to expand the Low Memorial Library did not come to fruition. Butler Library underwent major renovations, which were completed in several stages, between 1995 and 2009. In 2018 the library was targeted by student activists, calling for \\"decolonialization\\" of the campus, including replacing inscriptions and statues to facilitate better representation of women and marginalized people.  Design  The library's facade features a colonnade of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of writers, philosophers, and thinkers: Homer, Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Cicero, and Vergil on the northern face, towards College Walk and the Low Library. Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Voltaire, and Goethe on the east, facing John Jay Hall and Wallach Hall; and Horace, Tacitus, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Dante on the western facade, facing Alfred Lerner Hall and Carman Hall. The large mural in the entrance lobby, titled Videbimus Lumen, (based on the university's motto In Lumine Tuo Videbimus Lumen, or In Thy Light Shall We See Light) was painted in 1934 by Eugene Francis Savage. The composition is anchored by the figure of Athena, echoing the large sculpture of Alma Mater in the center of the campus. The mural contains references to light, social struggle, fascism, and the architecture of Columbia and New York City. Butler Library remains at least partially open 24 hours a day during the academic year. In popular culture Several books and screenplays have been written in Butler, including Nobel Prize‚Äëwinning novelist Orhan Pamuk's The Black Book and the script for the film Capote. It also plays a role in Paul Auster's 2009 novel Invisible: the novel's main protagonist, Adam Walker, takes a job as a page in the library's stacks. This section of the novel is set in 1967 when the stacks were closed to library users. The page's task was to retrieve requested books from the stacks and re‚Äëshelve returned books. The library is also referenced in Erica Jong's Fear of Flying.

Directed by Francis Lawrence, the film stars Will Smith as US Army virologist Robert Neville. It is set in New York City after a virus, which was originally created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal mutants. Neville is immune to the virus and he works to develop a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants. It is the third feature-film adaptation of Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend, following 1964's The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man. Warner Bros. began developing I Am Legend in 1994, and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in New York City, filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene at the Brooklyn Bridge. I Am Legend was released on December 14, 2007, in the United States and Canada, and opened to the largest ever box office (not adjusted for inflation) for a non-Christmas film released in the U.S. in December, and was the seventh highest grossing film of 2007, earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally, for a total of $585 million. The film received mostly favorable reviews, with Smith's performance being singled out for praise; criticism focused on its divergences from the novel, particularly the ending. Plot In 2009, a genetically re-engineered measles virus, originally created as a cure for cancer, turns lethal. The virus kills 90% (5.4 billion out of 6 billion) of the world's population and turns 9.8% (588 million) into vampiric albino zombie-like cannibalistic mutants called Darkseekers, who are extremely vulnerable to the ultraviolet rays in sunlight. The remaining 0.2% (12 million) of the population are immune to the virus and are the prey of the mutant Darkseekers. Three years after the outbreak, U.S. Army virologist Lt. Col. Robert Neville lives an isolated life in the deserted ruins of Manhattan, unsure if any other uninfected humans are left. Neville's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, searching for food and supplies, and waiting each day for any immune humans who might respond to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct them to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Flashbacks in his life reveal that his wife and daughter died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, as the military enforced a quarantine of the island. Neville himself stayed behind with other military personnel. Neville's only companions are his German Shepherd Samantha (Sam), some mannequins he regularly \\"talks\\" with, and the characters on film recordings from video stores. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day, Sam follows a deer into a building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer's corpse along with Sam, but the building is infested by Darkseekers. Both escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight. Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker. A male Darkseeker goes after them, but is blocked by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female seemingly without success. The next day, Neville notices \\"Fred\\", a mannequin usually at the local video store, positioned outside Grand Central Terminal and shoots him in disgust. However, Neville realizes he is being watched by the Darkseekers all over the buildings. As he approaches Fred's body, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female; by the time he escapes, the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam eliminate them but Sam is bitten during the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to choke her to death before she turns. Heartbroken and driven by rage, Neville ventures out and deliberately attacks a group of Darkseekers the following night before he is rescued by a pair of immune humans, Anna and a young boy named Ethan, who have traveled from Maryland after hearing his broadcast. The two take an injured Neville back to his home where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from S√£o Paulo and are making their way to a survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville denies this and argues that no such survivors' camp exists. Neville adjusts the potential cure and injects the female Darkseeker. The next night, a group of Darkseekers, who followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attack the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female test subject. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as a Darkseeker rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors camp in Bethel where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville's effort and sacrifice to save humanity ultimately became legend and people should take inspiration from him. =Director's Cut ending= During the lab attack, the alpha male makes a butterfly-shaped crack while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. The butterfly reminds Neville of the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker and he realizes that the alpha male is trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down, where Neville apologizes to the latter after seeing tears roll down the alpha male's eyes. The alpha male contemplates killing Neville, but accepts the apology and leaves with the rest of his clan. Once they‚Äôre gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many photographs of his test subjects, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years. The next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont, a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors‚Äô colony. They drive down across a bridge while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: \\"You are not alone.‚Äùhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJBf94enIaU at 3:14 Cast * Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville: A former U.S. Army virologist before the worldwide plague, he loses his wife and daughter in a helicopter crash shortly after Manhattan is quarantined and spends the next three years trying to find a cure while defending himself against the Darkseekers.

In the background is the house where Will Smith's character lives. The science- fiction horror genre reemerged in the late 1990s. In 1995, Warner Bros. began developing the film project, having owned the rights to Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man. Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich's first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict, as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer. Actors Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas, and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film, using a script by Protosevich and with Ridley Scott as director; however, by June 1997, the studio's preference was for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations, with production slated to begin the coming September, using Houston as a stand-in for the film's setting of Los Angeles. Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing, John Logan, with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts. The Scott/Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending. The creatures in Logan's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott ‚Äì then on a negative streak of box office disappointments ‚Äì and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an \\"esoteric\\" draft by writer Neal Jimenez, Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again. In December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film's budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office failures of Scott's last three films, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground. In March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend, commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film. Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget. The project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn's dislike of the script. In 2004, Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film. In September 2005, director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project, with production slated to begin in 2006. Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Lawrence, whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments. He said, \\"Something's always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long.\\" Goldsman took on the project as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema. =Casting= Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like \\"Gladiator [or] Forrest Gump‚Äîthese are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [This] always felt like it had those possibilities to me.\\" The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that \\"when you're on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict.\\" The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, \\"Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?\\" He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000). Abbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd dogs, played Neville's dog Sam. The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe, Robert's wife, and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna. Willow Smith, Will Smith's daughter, makes her film debut as Marley, Neville's daughter. Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin, who appears on television explaining her vaccine for cancer that mutates into the virus. Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected \\"hemocytes\\", and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected \\"alpha male\\". Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President's voice (Pat Fraley), and the cast of The Today Show. =Filming= The Brooklyn Bridge, where a $5-million scene was filmed Marcy Avenue Armory Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, \\"L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [but] New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world.\\" Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35. Filming began on September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville's home, while Greenwich Village was used for the exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, \\"I don't think anyone's going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career.\\" A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York's citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film's reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members. Also present were several Humvees, three Strykers, a cutter, a utility boat, and two response boat small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. Filming concluded on March 31, 2007. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island. The end of the film was shot in Lambertville, New Jersey.http://parlaystudios.com/blog/film-locations-didnt-know-new-jersey/ Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, \\"We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie.\\" Scenes feature Smith's Neville and dog Sam chasing wildlife in a 2007 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. =Effects= A week into filming, Francis felt the infected (referred to as \\"Darkseekers\\" or \\"hemocytes\\" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time and Lawrence explained, \\"They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out of people in the middle of the night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly hyperventilating, which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out.\\" The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. \\"The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard\\", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected. In addition, CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence: \\"We didn't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted.\\" Release I Am Legend was originally slated for a November 21, 2007, release in the United States and Canada, but was delayed to December 14. The film opened on December 26, 2007, in the United Kingdom, and Ireland, having been originally scheduled for January 4, 2008. In December 2007, China temporarily suspended the release of all American films in the country, which is believed to have delayed the release of I Am Legend. Will Smith spoke to the chairman of China Film Group about securing a release date, later explaining, \\"We struggled very, very hard to try to get it to work out, but there are only a certain amount of foreign films that are allowed in.\\" Premieres were held in Tokyo, New York, and London. At the London premiere in Leicester Square, British comedian and actor Neg Dupree was arrested after pushing his way onto the red carpet and running around shouting \\"I am Negend!\\". Neg Dupree Red Carpet Run The stunt was part of his \\"Neg's Urban Sports\\" section of comedy game show Balls of Steel. =Marketing= The film's teaser was attached to the screenings of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. And a tie-in comic from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics was created, I Am Legend: Awakening. The project drew upon collaboration from Bill Sienkiewicz, screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author Orson Scott Card. The son of the original book's author, Richard Christian Matheson, also collaborated on the project. The project advanced from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes (created by the team from Broken Saints) were shown on the official website. In October 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures, in conjunction with the Electric Sheep Company, launched the online multiplayer game I Am Legend: Survival in the virtual world Second Life. The game was the largest launched in the virtual world in support of a film release, permitting people to play against each other as the infected or the uninfected across a replicated of New York City. The studio also hired the ad agency Crew Creative to develop a website that was specifically viewable on the iPhone. =Box office= I Am Legend grossed $77,211,321 on its opening weekend in 3,606 theaters, averaging $21,412 per venue, and placing it at the top of the box office. This set a record for highest-grossing opening for a film for December. The film grossed $256,393,010 in North America and a total of $585,349,010 worldwide. The film was the sixth-highest grossing film of 2007 in North America, and as of April 2014, it remained among the top 100 all-time highest-grossing films both domestically and worldwide (unadjusted for ticket price inflation). =Home media= The film was released on DVD on March 18, 2008, in two editions: a one-disc release, including the movie with four animated comics (\\"Death As a Gift\\", \\"Isolation\\", \\"Sacrificing the Few for the Many\\", and \\"Shelter\\"), and other DVD-ROM features, and a two-disc special edition that includes all these extras, an alternative theatrical version of the movie with an ending that follows closer to that from the novel, and a digital copy of the film. On the high-definition end, the movie has been released on the Blu-ray Disc format and HD DVD format along with the DVD release, with the HD-DVD version being released later on April 8, 2008. Both HD releases include all the features available in the two-disc DVD edition. A three-disk Ultimate Collector's Edition was also released on December 9, 2008. The film has sold 7.04 million DVDs and earned $126.2 million in revenue, making it the sixth-best-selling DVD of 2008. However, Warner Bros. was reportedly \\"a little disappointed\\" with the film's performance on the DVD market. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack for I Am Legend was released on January 15, 2008, under the record label Var√®se Sarabande. The music was composed by James Newton Howard. The film also features Bob Marley songs \\"Redemption Song\\" \\"Three Little Birds\\" and \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\". Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film had an approval rating of 68% based on 215 reviews, with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith's mesmerizing performance.\\" On Metacritic, the film has an weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A. O. Scott wrote that Will Smith gave a \\"graceful and effortless performance\\" and also noted the \\"third-act collapse\\". He felt that the movie \\"does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization\\". Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark, noting that \\"the Infected just aren't that scary.\\" NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film's subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other, more direct cinematic explorations of the subject. Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, commending Will Smith as being in \\"prime form\\", also saying there are \\"some amazing sequences\\" and that there was \\"a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film.\\" The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson's novel, especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme. Much of the negative criticism concerned the film's third act, with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release. =Other response= Popular Mechanics published an article on December 14, 2007, addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film: # the rate of deterioration of urban structures, infrastructure, and survival of fauna and flora # the plausibility of a retrovirus spreading out of control as depicted in the film (The measles virus depicted in the film is not a retrovirus, but is in fact a part of the Paramyxovirus family.) # the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction The magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, virologist W. Ian Lipkin, MD, and Michel Bruneau, PhD, comparing their predictions with the film's depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville's method of producing power using gasoline- powered generators seemed the most credible: \\"This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely,\\" Popular Mechanics editor Roy Berendsohn says. Marxist philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek criticized the film politically for, in his view, \\"being the most regressive adaptation from the novel.\\" He said that while the original novel had a \\"progressive multicultural message\\" where Neville became a \\"legend\\" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampires were legends to humans), the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through \\"divine intervention.\\" For ≈Ωi≈æek, this misses the original message and \\"openly opt[s] for religious fundamentalism.\\" =Accolades= I Am Legend earned four nominations for the Visual Effects Society awards, and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards,https://film-base.pl/screen-actors-guilds-awards/ Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards, and Best Sound at the Satellite Awards. In June 2008, Will Smith won a Saturn Award for Best Actor. Will Smith also won the MTV Movie Awards for Best Male Performance. Possible prequel Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director, contingent on a sufficiently interesting story. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of being alone. Lawrence stated, \\"... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?\\" In May 2011, Francis Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, \\"I don't think that's ever going to happen.\\" In 2012, Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had begun to produce another installment, with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the author Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as a reboot of the story, hoping to create a franchise with the new film. Will Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, has not commented on whether he would appear.

The complex is an established mixed-use, office, retail, dining and entertainment center and serves as the third major shopping mall in the Dayton region. The co-owner and developer, Steiner + Associates, is known for creating similar town centers such as the Easton Town Center in Columbus as well as other centers in the Cincinnati-Newport, Milwaukee and Kansas City regions. Development The Greene was built in two phases over of land at a cost estimated exceed $200 million when complete. The developer provided the majority of the funding, but based on the $186 million estimate, the public's share is $14.8 million, or eight percent of the total cost.Developer says community focus at heart of The Greene's concept This is the lowest percentage bond financing in their portfolio. The location of the property is within the southeast boundaries of Indian Ripple and Stroop Roads, just off the exit to I-675. Phase I was completed 2006. The first phase includes tenants such as Lane Bryant, White House Black Market, Cheesecake Factory, Chico's, Sephora, and numerous other retailers and/or restaurants, some new to the Dayton area. The architect of record for the majority of the project was Meachem and Apel. A view of The Greene The development for Phase I also included: a comedy club (The Funny Bone), a fitness club (Urban Active), as well as an upscale movie theater (Rave Cinemas). Phase I also includes of second-floor office space overlooking the town square and approximately 136 residential loft apartments. The mixed-use residential buildings were designed by Torti Gallas and Partners. Von Maur Anchor Store Phase II focused on fashion which include the anchor department store, Von Maur. Von Maur is sometimes described as the Nordstrom of the Midwest and features fashion, accessories and beauty products, but not furniture or other department store goods. Like Nordstrom, Von Maur is also known for a high degree of customer service, including handwritten notes from employees following purchases. Phase II was completed in fall 2008. Along with Von Maur, several other stores and shops have filled some vacant space in the complex. In 2014, The Greene announced it would construct a 35,000sq.ft. building for the national retailer Nordstrom Rack. The environment of The Greene is that of a civic center which hosts outdoor concerts, holiday events and a family gathering space during both the summer and winter, in particular children playing in the main fountain during the summer. Research from other Steiner projects has evidenced that the number of visitors is essentially unaffected by seasonal weather. All metered parking benefits a charitable foundation. Parking in lots and garages is free. The affluent areas of Beavercreek, Bellbrook, Kettering, Oakwood, Centerville, and Springboro are the core market for the shopping complex. Controversy During construction, the shopping center was a controversial topic among people in the cities surrounding the development. The land was once a heavily wooded property and Beavercreek officials debated on the economic impact. Opponents also question if the area could support The Greene, The Mall at Fairfield Commons and the Dayton Mall.DaytonDailyNews: Dayton, Ohio, news and information Security The Greene has an age-restricted curfew of 9:00 p.m. everyday. Persons under the age of 16 are not permitted on the premises of the center without an adult present. Tornado On May 26, 2015, several stores within the area of The Greene and The Greene Crossing shopping centers were damaged by a brief EF1 tornado, which flipped cars and uprooted trees. Two individuals suffered minor injuries and a Kmart parking lot was evacuated. Ten cars were overturned in the parking lot of a Japanese restaurant and a Waffle House restaurant was also damaged. The tornado was part of a wider system that affected greater Dayton, Ohio area, downing trees and wires and damaging roofs. Video of the tornado was captured by security cameras of The Greene Town Center. The tornado was on the ground for approximately one minute and traveled half a mile. Winds reached speeds of over 100 MPH. As of the next morning, power was still out to several businesses affected by the tornado. A franchise of Fitworks, a gym with locations in Ohio and Kentucky, was reported as possibly having the most damage. The Waffle House had power, but remained closed due to damage to its roof.

It was located at the northern end of a Germany Army training area at Lamsdorf, Silesia, (now ≈Åambinowice, Poland) just to the north of Stalag VIII-B. Camp history Opened in July 1941, it was initially designated Stalag 318, but was renamed Stalag VIII-F towards the end of the year. In June 1943, it came under the control of the nearby Stalag VIII-B, and the complex of camps were in turn redesignated Stalag 344 in November. The camp was known locally as the Russenlager (\\"Russian camp\\"), but also held Poles, Italians, Yugoslavs, and Greeks, as well as small numbers of French and Romanians. Physical and sanitary conditions were very poor, and of the estimated 200,000 Soviet prisoners who passed through the camp, about 40,000 died of starvation, mistreatment and disease. The Germans did not apply the provisions of the Third Geneva Convention to Soviet prisoners on the grounds that the Soviet Union was not a signatory. In October 1944, about 6,000 soldiers of the Armia Krajowa arrived after being captured in the Warsaw Uprising. About 400 women soldiers of the AK were also held there temporarily, before being transferred to another camp. At about the same time 1,500 prisoners from Slovak Uprising arrived. In late January 1945 the camp was evacuated, and the POWs forced to march westward away from the advancing Soviets. The sick were left behind, and most were dead by the time that detachments of the Red Army reached the camp on 17 March 1945. Memorials Most of the camp has been demolished, but a fenced area with a reconstructed watch tower and hut contains an exhibition dedicated to the Soviet POWs. The former Administration block now houses the Central Museum of Prisoners-of-War. In 1997 a granite obelisk, crowned with a cross, was erected to commemorate the Warsaw insurgents.

It is situated at Hauk√•sen, from Kaupanger and from Sogndalsfj√∏ra. It serves the whole Sogn district. The airport consists of a runway aligned 06/24. Services are provided by Wider√∏e on public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport is owned and operated by the state- owned Avinor and served 70,244 passengers in 2014. The airport opened on 1 July 1971 along with three other regional airports in Sogn og Fjordane and Sunnm√∏re. These were at first connected to Bergen and √Ölesund using the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter. From the 1980s the airport was upgraded and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 started being used, allowing all-year services to Oslo. History A government commission, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle was about to the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners,Svanberg: 662‚Äì663 including an airport in Flor√∏ to serve Sogn og Fjordane. Wider√∏e launched an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. H√•kon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population. Road to the airport As an alternative location for the airport to serve Sogn, H√∏yanger was considered and test flights were flown there. Also Gaupne was considered by an industrial conglomerate led by Aker, although also these plans were shelved. Hauk√•sen was therefore selected as the site of the airport. Mayor of Sogndal, Nils Knagenhjelm, offered a free section of land at Hauk√•sen if the airport was located there. He had built a road to the area in the 1960s. The terms were accepted and the land and the road were taken over by the airport at the time of the aerodrome's completion. The regional airports only received a simple terminal and an runway. The first such airports were opened in Helgeland in 1968. This was deeded sufficiently successful that Parliament approved the second stage in 1969, consisting of four airports in Northwestern Norway. In addition to Sogndal, these consisted of F√∏rde Airport, √òyrane; Flor√∏ Airport and √òrsta‚ÄìVolda Airport, Hovden. All four airports opened on 1 July 1971. The airport initially consisted of an integrated terminal and works building with a control tower. Sogndal Airport received a runway measuring and an apron measuring .Arnesen: 119 Services were provided by Wider√∏e, which operated the 19-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter to Bergen Airport, Flesland and √Ölesund Airport, Vigra. The road to the airport was frequently closed and in 1978 a dorm was built to allow the employees to overnight should they get caught by a blizzard. A new fire station was built in the early 1980s. This allowed Wider√∏e to introduce the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 on the route from Flor√∏ and Sogndal to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in September 1983.Arnesen: 138 This was followed up with a new and larger terminal and the renovation of the tower in 1985. Wider√∏e replaced its Twin Otters and Dash 7s with the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 in the early 1990s. Ownership of the airport passed from Sogndal Municipality to the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. The airport was upgraded between 2004 and 2007 with expanded safety areas, lights, land- and air-side parking, a new arrival terminal, navigational system and additional garage space. Facilities de Havilland Canada Dash 8-103 at Sogndal Airport Sogndal Airport is situated in the heights of the Hauk√•sen in Sogndal, situated from Kaupanger and from Sogndalsfj√¶ra.

Litespeed makes titanium and carbon fiber frame road racing bicycles and mountain bikes. Titanium bicycle frames are famed for their ride quality. Litespeed, along with triathlon specific bicycle manufacturer Quintana Roo, is a subsidiary of the American Bicycle Group.  History  The company has its roots in a custom machine shop known as Southeast Machine that specialized in exotic metals. Its interest in bicycles began when one of the workers took up cycling while recovering from a running injury. He used leftover titanium frames from a chemical job to build the first frame in 1986. Frame after frame was made until one was deemed show worthy and taken to the Long Beach bike show in 1987. Thus began the journey that would make Litespeed the go to authority on titanium bicycles. Litespeed bicycles have been tested and ridden by many in the competitive cycling and triathlon world: Tour de France cyclists Greg Lemond, Robbie McEwen, and Lance Armstrong; wheel innovator Steve Hed; IRONMAN competitors Tim DeBoom and Cameron Brown; Olympians Simon Whitefield, Jeff Kabush, the ITU Triathlon World Cup champion Vanessa Fernandes (Portugal), and 59-time French champion and 13-time world champion Jeannie Longo. In the 1999 Tour de France, Lance Armstrong rode a titanium Litespeed Blade painted and labeled as a Trek during time trials. Several professionals have ridden Litespeeds painted as other brands. European brands such as Eddy Merckx and Bianchi have contracted Litespeed to construct titanium frames in their own lines. Litespeed purchased Merlin (bicycles) and Quintana Roo in 2000 from Saucony, and trademark of Tomac in 2001. In March 2011, American Bicycle Group announced that bicycle retailer Competitive Cyclist of Little Rock, AR had acquired the rights to the Merlin Metalworks brand. Litespeed has also sponsored the professional cycling teams Lotto-Adecco, DFL-Cyclingnews-Litespeed, Calyon/Litespeed Pro Cycling, and Team Maxxis. In 2014, Litespeed announced that they would sponsor the Astellas Pro Cycling Team for three seasons. Litespeed has been a contractor and consultant to NASA for projects that require titanium-intensive sub- assemblies including the landing gear on the Mars Curiosity Rover.  Models  =Road= T-Series: The titanium T-Series includes award-winning T1 (formerly the Archon), the T3, T5, and the T7 which was introduced in 2013. The T1sl replaces the T1 in 2016. It is 15% lighter than the 2015 T1. L-Series: The carbon L-Series was introduced in 2012. Litespeed has four L-Series bikes: L1R, L1 (SRAM Red), Li2, and L3 (Ultegra). The L-Series is an all-around road racing bike, with an asymmetrical frame, and UCI-approved. C-Series: The carbon C-Series was introduced in 2008. Litespeed has four C-Series bikes: C1R, C1 (Dura-Ace), Ci2, and C3 (Ultegra). The C-Series is an aerodynamic road bike series. M-Series: Litespeed has two M-Series bikes: M1 and M3. The M-Series are built to exceed the demands of training and racing, day in and day out, with design features that are unheard-of at this price point. Non-Current Titanium Models: Classic, Ultimate, Catalyst, Vortex, Nachez, Tuscany, Liege, Palmares, Arenberg, Siena, Ghisallo, Veneto, Solano, Firenze, Teramo, Bella, Ardennes, Archon, Niota, Icon, Xicon, Tachyon, Blade, Appalachian Aluminum Models: Sirius, Avior, Mira, Vela, Palio. Aluminum frames first introduced in 2002, remained in production until approximately 2010. These models included titanium wrapped, carbon forks and seat stays. =Mountain= Pinhoti SL: Named after the rugged trail system in Georgia, The Pinhoti SL is the perfect titanium hardtail. Whether geared or singlespeed, it has amazing vertical compliance with perfect torsional rigidity. Compact rear- center and shorter wheelbase create an agile platform for quick and responsive handling. Elevated seat stays yield more support and stability for a balanced center. Citico: Named after the Citico Creek Wilderness in Southeastern Tennessee, the pro-grade, Archon-inspired Citico is the first MTB frame to use a T1 engineered 6Al/4V, 6-sided and flared top tube and an oversized bi- axially ovalized down tube to maximize steering feedback, accuracy, and front end stiffness. Compatible with both 26\\" and 650b wheels. Pisgah: Geometry identical to the Citico, the Pisgah puts Litespeed performance into service for any cross-country, single-speed, or urban MTB build. Compatible with both 26\\" and 650b wheels. Sewanee: A full-suspension cross country race bike, the latest Sewanee features 90 mm of rear travel in a cold-worked 3Al/2.5V titanium frame. Compatible with both 26\\" and 650b wheels. Cohutta: Features the industry's first 29er-specific titanium tubeset. = Time Trial = Blade: The legendary Litespeed Blade has been reintroduced as a Limited Edition carbon frameset in Litespeed's 2016 model lineup. The Blade is a super- minimalist TT frameset, designed to excel on the hillier, windier, more challenging courses and no penalty on the flat, fast days. Astellas Pro Cycling competed with carbon Litespeed Blades in the 2015 UCI Road World Championship TTT (Team Time Trial). The original Blade models were crafted with titanium material and ridden by many great cyclists, such as Lance Armstrong. = Gravel = Gravel: A bike designed for the recent craze of riding on gravel roads. It has a road bike style frame and handlebars, disc brakes, and room for wide tires.  Technology  =Titanium= Litespeed uses 6/4 titanium, which is an alloy of titanium with 6 percent aluminum and 4 percent vanadium, instead of the more-common 3/2.5 titanium. It is more difficult to work with, but has a better strength to weight ratio than other available alloys. It was initially not available as tubes, so Litespeed bought thin plates and cold-rolled and welded their own tubes. =AeroLogic= A key feature of Litespeed's C-Series of aero road bikes, AeroLogic is the incorporation of aerodynamic elements into frame design without the penalty of excess weight. AeroLogic features on the C-Series include a shrouded water bottle mount on the down tube, aero-tuned tube cross sections, a \\"morphed\\" shaping of the seat stays, and a proprietary bladed and bowed aero fork. =Reactive Pressure Molding= Litespeed's Reactive Pressure Molding (RPM) is an advanced molding method utilized during manufacture of Litespeed's newest composite frames. The three primary benefits of RPM are weight reduction, increased stiffness, and improved durability. This advanced process allows designs elements far beyond what can be accomplished with conventional bladder molding. Unique features such as an all-carbon head tube, compatible with the most precise ZS style press fit headsets, as well the multitude of AeroLogic aerodynamic elements are incorporated without the need of solid, permanent components and unwanted filler materials. The result is higher performance with no weight penalty plus additional benefits of improved strength, impact resistance, and stiffness.

The genus is named after Lasthenia of Mantinea, a cross-dressing female pupil of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. DescriptionChan & Ornduff (2006) The goldfield genus comprises annual (rarely perennial) herbs that are either glabrous or hairy. Stems are typically branched and erect, attaining a height of less than . Their opposite leaves, up to in length, have entire margins and pinnate venation. Inflorescences are characterized by solitary heads (sometimes in cymes), with phyllaries free or partly fused. The receptacle may present as naked and narrowly conic to hemispherical. The normally yellow ray florets may number 4 to 16, and the ligules are typically yellow as well. The numerous disk florets typically have yellow, 5-lobed corollae. Anther tips manifest as acuminate to triangular. Style tips may be triangular or round and are typically hair-tufted. Fruits are less than across, cylindric to obovoid in shape, and black or gray in color. The pappus may present awns or scales, or infrequently neither. The genus is mostly cross-pollinated, with some insects serving as pollinators. California Goldfields (Lasthenia californica), Antelope Valley Ecology and horticulture Goldfield species occur over a range of habitat, such as meadows, shrubland and open forest, but tend towards semiarid conditions. They are commonly found at ephemeral pools and are important plants in coastal regions. They are visited by Sciaridae fungus gnats for nectar, and it is possible that these animals are key pollinators at least for Contra Costa Goldfields (L. conjugens). In horticulture, most make hardy ornamental plants, suitable for flower-beds or borders. Autumn is the best time for sowing the seed, but it may also be sown early in the spring.Pink (2004) Species L. californica There are a total of eighteen species, seventeen are endemic to North America and one species is only found in Chile. Of the seventeen species found in North America, most are endemic to California. *Lasthenia burkei - Burke's Goldfields (endemic to California, endangered) *Lasthenia californica ::Lasthenia californica subsp. californica - California Goldfields (found in northern California and Oregon) ::Lasthenia californica subsp. bakeri - Baker's Goldfields (endemic to California) ::Lasthenia californica subsp. macrantha - Perennial Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia chrysantha - Alkali sink Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia conjugens - Contra Costa Goldfields (endemic to California, endangered) *Lasthenia coronaria - Crowned Goldfields, Royal Goldfields (found in California and northern Mexico) *Lasthenia debilis - Greene's Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia ferrisiae - Ferris's Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia fremontii - Fremont's Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia glaberrima - Smooth Goldfields (found in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia) *Lasthenia glabrata ::Lasthenia glabrata subsp. glabrata - Yellow-ray Goldfields (endemic to California) ::Lasthenia glabrata subsp. coulteri - Coulter's Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia gracilis - Common Goldfields (found in California, Arizona, the Channel Islands of California, and northern Mexico) *Lasthenia kunthii - Chilean Goldfields (found in vernal pools in Chile)Ornduff (1966) *Lasthenia leptalea - Salinas Valley Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia maritima - Maritime Goldfields, Seaside Goldfields (found along the coast and offshore islands and islets from California to British Columbia) *Lasthenia microglossa - Small-ray Goldfields (endemic to California) *Lasthenia minor - Coastal Goldfields (endemic to coastal and inland California) *Lasthenia ornduffii - Ornduff's Goldfields (endemic to Oregon) *Lasthenia platycarpha - Alkali Goldfields (endemic to California) Footnotes References * (2006): Lasthenia.

The group plays Mediterranean-influenced music that incorporates Jewish, Southeastern Europe (mainly Balkan) and Middle Eastern traditions, Gypsy punk, reggae and electronica. As a musical unit they often collaborate with a host of other musicians both in the studio as well as live. History Co-founders Ori Kaplan and Firewater's member Tamir Muskat both met in Brooklyn, New York, NY as teenagers. Both had grown up with music; Kaplan had been a klezmer clarinetist, while Muskat was a drummer in a punk rock band. They established their own unique sound by fusing the musical styles of Mediterranean and Balkan traditions (mainly helped by Teo and the Chalga masters at the time) with hip hop and dancehall beats. Balkan Beat Box‚Äôs goal was to take ancient and traditional musical traditions and fuse those with hip hop in order to create a new mix of musical styles out of the traditional world music context that would appeal to listeners in a club or a dancehall. As children, they had felt that traditional music was outdated and felt as though it did not adequately reflect their experiences of the growing world culture, so hoped to bring new relevance to these old traditional musical forms. They cite Boban Markoviƒá, Rachid Taha, Fanfare Ciocarlia, Manu Chao, and Charlie Parker amongst their musical influences. The group was also influenced by Jamaican dub. In December 2006, the acclaimed artist from Tel Aviv Tomer Yosef became frontman for the group. Balkan Beat Box‚Äôs self-titled first album (released in 2005) and their 2007 follow-up album Nu Med both received global acclaim. While their first album focused more on Mediterranean sounds, their second album included Arabic and Spanish influences. The song \\"Bulgarian Chicks\\" from their first album became popular in clubs and dancehalls in 2008. The group released Blue Eyed Black Boy in 2010 and Give in 2012. Regarded as the \\"godfathers of global bass\\" by MTV Iggy, the band continued to expand their sound incorporating electronic dance music, reggae, cumbia, and brass bands into their tracks. Blue Eyed Black Boy was recorded in Romania with the Jovica Ajderevic Orkestar brass band, and at Vibromonk East in Tel Aviv. Key tracks are \\"Dancing with the Moon\\", \\"Move It\\", \\"Blue Eyed Black Boy\\", and \\"War Again\\" as harbinger of things to come. The album Give was influenced by the Arab Spring, Occupy movements, and the spirit of change around the world. Spin Magazine dubbed the band \\"a global peace-keeping mission you can dance to\\". Samplings and adaptations The band's popular song \\"Bulgarian Chicks\\" was sampled by Mac Miller in the Diplo-produced track \\"Goosebumpz\\" in Spring 2013. Later \\"Bulgarian Chicks\\" was also sampled in \\"Sis: Trompeta\\".Rolling Stone: Balkan Beat Box on Their 'Talk Dirty' Sample and Why the Sax is Back The album Nu Med, already famous internationally became more popular when in August 2013 the song \\"Hermetico\\" taken from the album was sampled by Jason Derulo in his international hit \\"Talk Dirty\\" featuring 2 Chainz.Who Sampled website: Talk Dirty by Jason Der√ºlo feat. 2 Chainz In 2014, the Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis sampled the song \\"Adir Adirim\\" from Balkan Beat Box's eponymous album for the track \\"Mr. Toot\\". This track debuted as part of the fourth season of their show I kveld med YLVIS. Appearances in media Their song featured in EA Sports' FIFA game series twice such as \\"Ramallah-Tel Aviv\\" featuring Tomer Yosef and Saz from album Nu Made (Remixes) in FIFA 10 and \\"I Trusted You\\" from album Shout it Out in FIFA 17. \\"9/4 the Ladies\\" was featured in the 2008 film You Don't Mess with the Zohan. \\"Hermetico\\" and \\"Balcasio\\" were featured in a 2009 episode of the TV series Bored to Death. \\"Marcha de la Vida\\" was featured in Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 They contributed an original song with production duo Stargate for the 2015 film Home, entitled \\"Slushious\\".

It was loosely based on the life of Judge Roy Bean. Plot An outlaw, Roy Bean, rides into a West Texas border town called Vinegaroon by himself. The customers in the saloon beat him, rob him, toss a noose around him and let Bean's horse drag him off. A young woman named Maria Elena finds and helps him. Bean promptly returns to town and shoots all those who did him wrong. With no law and order, he appoints himself judge and \\"the law west of the Pecos\\" and becomes the townspeople's \\"patrone.\\" A traveling preacher, LaSalle, buries the dead. Bean renames the saloon The Jersey Lilly and hangs a portrait of a woman he worships but has never met, Lillie Langtry, a noted actress and singer of the 1890s. When a band of thieves comes to town (Big Bart Jackson and gang members Nick the Grub, Fermel Parlee, Tector Crites and Whorehouse Lucky Jim), rather than oppose them, Bean swears them in as lawmen. The new marshals round up other outlaws, then claim their goods after Bean sentences them to hang. Dispensing his own kind of frontier justice, Bean lets the marshals hang a murderer named Sam Dodd and share his money. When a drunk shoots up a saloon, Bean doesn't mind, but when Lillie's portrait is struck by a bullet, the fellow is shot dead on the spot. Bean then goes through the dead drunk's pockets. Finding money, he then fines the dead drunk for discharging a firearm in a public place and pockets the money. A madman, Bad Bob, comes to town for a showdown, but Bean shoots him in the back. Prostitutes are sentenced to remain in town and keep the marshals company. Maria Elena is given a place to live and fine clothes ordered from a Sears Roebuck catalog. A mountain man called Grizzly Adams gives her and Bean a bear, named \\"Zachary Taylor\\" after the 12th President of the United States, but later renamed the \\"Watch Bear,\\" as a pet. When a lawyer named Frank Gass shows up claiming the saloon is rightfully his, Bean puts him in a cage with the bear. Bean goes off to San Antonio alone to see Jersey Lilly, leaving a pregnant Maria Elena behind and promising her a music box that plays \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas.\\" In his absence, Gass and the prostitutes conspire to seize control of the town from the judge's hard rule. A dapper Bean tries to see Lillie Langtry's show, but it is sold-out. He is deceived by men who knock him cold and steal his money. Upon his return, Bean finds that Maria Elena is dying following a difficult childbirth. He names the baby Rose after the music box's song. He also plans to hang the doctor, but Gass, who has been elected mayor, overrules him. Bean is sorrowful about losing Maria Elena and rides away. Gass brings in hired guns to get rid of Bean's marshals. Years go by. Oil rigs have been built around the prospering town. Automobiles are seen everywhere. A grown-up Rose is surprised one day to look up and find Bean has returned. A shootout follows. Bean, on horseback, chases Gass into a burning building, declaring \\"For Texas, and Miss Lilly!\\". Some time later, a train pauses by the town. Out steps Lillie Langtry. She is told the story of Judge Roy Bean and his feelings toward her by Tector, the caretaker of the saloon, now turned into a museum. She concludes that he must have been quite a character.

In some crummy little town, a Sergio Leone leftover and have Warren be the Judge.\\" The script was sent to Lee Marvin who was making Pocket Money with Paul Newman; Newman read the script and became enthusiastic about starring. The producers were not keen on Milius directing and paid a record price to own the script outright - $300,000.Strawn, Linda.

It's incredible. He goes on a picnic and sits on a teeter- > totter. It's a movie about Beverly Hills people. About John Foreman and John > Huston and Paul Newman. Milius also said Huston \\"would explain what he was doing to me all the time. We had a strange relationship. He tortured me constantly, changing things and doing scenes, I thought, deliberately wrong. At the same time, he would explain his options and why he made the decision he made, right or wrong; or the different ways he could have done it. I watched the way an atmosphere was created on the set, watched the way he would respond to an actor resisting him and the way he dealt with an actor going along with him too easily. How he would deal with bad actors. I remember one time when he had someone he said was the worst he'd ever had, and I asked him, what do you do? And he said, ‚ÄòNot a damn thing, I have no idea.‚Äô He just went back to his trailer.\\" Milius said there \\"was a terrific amount of humor in the original screenplay. More humor than was in this one (the movie). But it still had a feel that was closer to say a Sergio Leone movie... The Good, the Bad and the Ugly would probably be a good example.\\" Milius claimed the experience prompted him to go into directing \\"out of self defence and a desire to control\\".Murphy, Mary.

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and wrote, \\"Not the 'bawdy' gags, nor the 'Marmalade, Molasses and Honey' musical interlude sung by Andy Williams, can hide the essential flaw in Roy Bean: He is a blind, egotistical jerk who gets off by hanging people.\\"Siskel, Gene (February 22, 1973). \\"John Wayne at his mythical best\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 6. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Arguably overlong, arguably self-indulgent on occasion, 'The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean' is nonetheless happily as intent upon being fun as it is in being significant.

Surely his performance here is a high point in a notable career.\\"Thomas, Kevin (December 22, 1972). \\"Law, Order in Vinegaroon\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 14. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post declared the film \\"a big name bummer. I spent the better part of an exceedingly slow two hours fighting recurrent attacks of drowsiness ... The episodic structure is undermined by too many episodes that depend on crude jokes, dumb wheezes and gratuitous killing. As the scenes and the would-be 'colorful' characters flop and repeat themselves, one's interest begins to evaporate.\\"Arnold, Gary (March 10, 1973). \\"Life and Times\\". The Washington Post. B9. Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Now and again, thanks the choice of an episodic style and the use of an engaging crop of guest stars in cameo roles, there are glimpses of what might have been; moments when the film looks as if it might take off like Butch Cassidy or say something meaningful like Little Big Man ... But these are small oases in a large desert, and no matter how dismissive John Huston may choose to be about his film, it has the air of an elaborate mistake‚Äîoverblown, tedious and over-emphatic.\\" The film currently holds a score of 75% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews.

Point No Point Light, located in the Chesapeake Bay off the eponymous point several miles north of the mouth of the Potomac River, was constructed as part of a program to add lighted navigational aids in a thirty-mile stretch of the bay between Cove and Smith Points.  History  The first request for funds to construct this light came in 1891; funds were not appropriated, however, until 1901. Due to the exposed location a pneumatic caisson base was used. This was constructed in 1902 and towed to the site in April 1903, when it was secured to a temporary pier. As with construction of Baltimore Light, a series of mishaps followed. First, the temporary pier collapsed, breaking off two courses of iron plates from the caisson and releasing it from its mooring. The caisson was retrieved and repaired, and in October of that year was set in place. However, in February 1904 the temporary pier was again destroyed, this time by moving ice. The caisson survived without damage, and the light was first shown on April 24, 1905. Although the light was automated in 1938, it continued to be manned until 1962. Renovations were carried out in 1989‚Äì2001 in order to arrest deterioration of the now-unoccupied structure. In 2006, like other Maryland lights, it was made available to non-profits or government agencies who would be willing to take over maintenance, and in 2007 the offer was extended to individuals. Public auction of the light was cancelled in February 2008, however, \\"due to safety requirements of the U.S. Navy.\\"  Notes   References  *Point No Point Lighthouse, Maryland from LighthouseFriends.com Chesapeake Bay Lighthouse Project ‚Äì Point No Point Light  External links  *, including photo from 2000, at Maryland Historical Trust * Category:Lighthouses completed in 1905 Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Lighthouses in St. Mary's County, Maryland Category:1905 establishments in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Mary's County, Maryland ","title":"Point No Point Light (Maryland)"},{"id":"6642308","text":"The Presbyterian Publishing Corporation is a religious corporation, which is the publishing agency of the Presbyterian Church (USA).

His broadcasts from the BBC World Service ranged on varying topics from the Suez Crisis and Palestine to the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963. He was one of the first presenters at the start of the BBC TV show The Money Programme in 1966. The Suez Canal and Palestine issues would later form the basis of his writing on the subjects. He was distinguished as one of the first mainstream writers in the West to systematically challenge the contention that Palestinian Arab refugees of the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War (see 1948 Palestinian exodus) fled their homes primarily from Arab broadcast evacuation orders (see Broadcasts for Christopher Hitchens' article about same), rather than from the use of force and terror by armed forces of the newly forming state of Israel. United Nations Civil Servant He specialised in UN issues, even serving as a periodic consultant including a special mission in the Congo for Secretary-General U Thant. In 1967, under the leadership of Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr.; Childers was hired to lead a United Nations, UNICEF & UNDP programme called Development Support Communication; or DSCS. In 1968, Childers co-authored a paper with United Nations colleague Mallica Vajrathon called \\"Project Support Communication,\\" later published in an important anthology about social change.\\"Colle, R.

South Orange, NJ: Communication For Social Change Consortium. ; pp. 495‚Äì499 In this paper he wrote, From 1975 to 1988, Childers was based in New York as Director of Information for UNDP. By his retirement in 1989 as Senior Advisor to the UN Director General for Development and International Economic Co-operation, after 22 years of service; Childers had worked with most of the organisations of the UN system, at all levels and in all regions.In Memoriam: Erskine Childers, 1929‚Äì1996 The Ford Foundation and the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Foundation After his retirement, Erskine Childers continued to strive relentlessly for the ideals for which he had worked so hard. He co-authored several notable books for the Ford Foundation and the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Foundation on the reform of the United Nations with his colleague and equally devoted United Nations civil servant, Sir Brian Urquhart. The best known of these publications is A World in Need of Leadership. He continued writing on United Nations matters whilst travelling constantly; lecturing on the Organisation and the many challenges confronting it, such as globalisation and democracy, conflict prevention and peace-keeping, humanitarian assistance, human rights, famine, ageing and development, health, financial arrangement of the United Nations, citizen's rights, female participation, design and perceptions, education, the North South divide and world economy. In 1995, Childers co-authored a paper with his international law colleague Marjolijn Snippe called \\"The Agenda for Peace and the Law of the Sea\\", for Pacem in Maribus XXIII, the Annual Conference of the International Ocean Institute, that was held in Costa Rica, December 1995. He became Secretary General of the World Federation of United Nations Associations in March 1996. He served for only five months, and died on 25 August 1996 during the organisation's fiftieth anniversary congress. He is buried in Roundwood, Ireland.

It supersedes BS5930:1999+A2:2010, which itself supersedes BS 5930:1981 which in turn supersedes CP2001: 1957 \\"Site investigations\\". The stated purpose of the document is to \\"...deal(s) with the investigation of sites for the purposes of assessing their suitability for the construction of civil engineering and building works and of acquiring knowledge of the characteristics of a site that affect the design and construction of such work...\\". The document gives guidance on legal, environmental and technical matters relating to site investigation and includes a section on the description and classification of soils and rocks. BS5930:1999 was amended in December 2007 to avoid conflict with the newly introduced Eurocode 7 \\"Geotechnical Design\\" and the code is to be retained as a normative reference. BS5930:2015 is a further full revision of the standard, and introduces some principal changes including: compliance with BS EN 1997-1 and BS EN 1997-2 and related test standards; new information on geophysical surveying and ground testing, and updated guidance on desk studies, field reconnaissance, ground investigations on contaminated ground and ground affected by voids; the requirements of data capture in the field and in the inclusion of this in reporting. Section 1 Preliminary Considerations Pages 3‚Äì6BS 5930:1999 Seven factors to be cognizant of at this stage are: suitability of the site for the proposed works, economic and adequacy of design, optimum method of construction with reference to potential issues due to ground and groundwater. The effect of changes to the ground and environment due to the works, and, therefore the effect on the works from these changes. Consideration of suitability on a selection of sites. And finally, the existing works and their implications. If a site has been used in the past, this is a major factor in the investigation, mining, quarrying, landfill or waste disposal, industrial usages, archaeological or ecological factors may all have a bearing on the intended works. The cost of an SI is low relative to the project cost and when conducted thoroughly can be a significant saving later. Investigations should evaluate the nature of the ground and groundwater. The size and nature of the works will have a bearing on the investigations as will its former use as a site or contamination of ground or groundwater. It will be considered in 3 stages. First a desk study to collate the information above as far as possible. Where a site is contaminated it is appropriate at this stage to plan site safety procedures for any further investigations. Planning the details of further investigations is appropriate too. Existing records, local authorities, industry, libraries, present or past OS maps and aerial photography or even anecdotal information are to be used. A site reconnaissance should also be conducted at this stage and includes a thorough visual inspection of any exposed cuttings and note taken of level of vegetation. The surroundings should also be noted. Second, a more detailed investigation is undertaken and finally a construction review ‚Äì these shall be discussed later. Section 2 Ground investigations Pages 7‚Äì23 This is a natural follow on from the desk study, the objectives are similar ‚Äì acquiring sufficient information for design, assessing the hazards. Depending on the works the investigations will differ i.e. defects of existing works, slope failure or new works. Soil profile and groundwater condition should be established. Temporary or permanent changes should be investigated this involves changes in stresses and strains, moisture content, strength and compressibility. Certain areas will have old mines and underground cavities which need investigation. The ground investigation should be given enough time to be conducted before works are designed, this may involve in predicting ground condition at various times of the year. Due to the potential flexibility and size of an investigation, adequate supervision, equipment, testing, personnel, and audits should be provided in a safe manner. The extent of the GI can depend on many variables such as, character of site, availability of equipment and personnel and costs of methods. It should cover all ground affected by stresses and strains to an appropriate depth and breadth. Excavations, boreholes probing and geophysical surveying are used to investigate the ground. Intrusive investigations should be sited, spaced and backfilled with care. The GI should give sufficient information to make good decisions on design, construction material selection. The condition and accessibility on site may affect the equipment used. As the determination of groundwater conditions is important ‚Äì the use of piezometers are at times used. Ground conditions from rock and gravel through to silts and clays will determine the equipments and approach used in the ground investigations as will made up, contaminated ground and under water ground. Geotechnical specialists are used in the investigation and interpretation of results. Section 3 Field investigation Pages 24‚Äì45 This section is more specific with regard to how the ground is investigated using methods such as excavating or drilling. Frequency of sampling and testing can be decided with the following in mind, the determination of the character and structure of all the strata and ground water conditions, the determination of the properties of the strata and the use of special techniques should ‚Äònormal‚Äô techniques not give satisfactory results. Shallow trial pits go to a maximum depth of 4‚Äì5 metres, comprehensive records should include the location and orientation of the pit and the face logged. Samples should be taken as soon as the pit is opened and closed as soon as possible properly ‚Äì there are however advantages to leaving them open for a time. Samples are taken from deep trial pits and shafts at certain sites if necessary and if below the water table can become a more complicated process. Boring augers are in common use. There are two types of rotary drilling, open hole drilling and core drilling. The selection of the type and method used can depend on ground conditions and time and cost constraints. Recovered cores should be maintained as near as possible to its natural state until it is stored. In most cases it is inevitably disturbed. Another method is wash boring which is most applicable to sands, silts, and clays. However, these are not representative of the character and consistency of the penetrated strata. Ground water conditions are determined from water level in boreholes and the use of standpipe, hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic piezometers. Water samples should be representative and stored in appropriate containers. Backfilling should be well compacted to obviate the flow of groundwater to any aquifer below and/or settlement. The use of cement based grout can be used - bentonite is also used to decrease shrinkage. Sampling quality can be classified to determine depending on their disturbance and other factors such as, wet or dry ground. Samplers should conform to the standard. Sampling takes different forms i.e. ‚Äì continuous sampling, the sand and window sampler and block sampling. Due to the cost of sample acquisition, samples should be treated with great care. Good methods of handling and labelling should be established. Section 4 Field Tests Pages 46‚Äì98 These are used when laboratory testing is not enough to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with coarse silt or sand can mean unreliable results. Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a pumping test. Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types ‚Äì pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and core cutter test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used. In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory shear box test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids ‚Äì natural or man-made and engineering properties of the ground. Electrical resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages. Experience has shown care should be taken when writing the specification for this type of work amongst other factors. Section 5: Laboratory tests on samples Pages 101-111 These tests are to be undertaken to describe and classify samples, investigate the fundamental behaviour of soils and rocks, obtain soil and rock parameters with reference to design requirements. Nature of ground and soil type, quality and how representative the sample is, method of analysis proposed, requirement of the design along with laboratory capabilities are all key factors in lab testing. Provision of good handling, labelling and storage should facilitate the nominated testing. Practical experience and skill in testing are invaluable and lead to reliable predictions being made. Sample quality should be borne in mind when testing, and finally reporting unambiguous results is desirable. Section 6: Description of soils and rocks Pages 112-140 Results of ground investigations may be needed even after samples have been disposed, leaving only descriptions of the soil to go on, for this reason good descriptions should be given. Designers also use past experience of materials of similar properties. Quality of samples should be reflected in the description. Soil characteristics are based on particle size grading of the coarser particles and plasticity of the finer particles. Main descriptions should be kept concise however they can be followed by further details if applicable such as, density, discontinuities, bedding, colour, composite soil types, principal soil type, stratum name, geological formation, age and type of deposit and classification. Section 7: Field reports Pages 141-157 Field reports are filled in by the drillers, engineers, technicians, the field report should encourage the operator to record all the data necessary for the eventual interpretation necessary for the design or action necessary for new or remedial works. after a time, samples are destroyed and the only record maybe the field report, for this reason it should be composed and written in properly. Description of ground, ground water, boreholes and other factors should be recorded and commented on, recommendation with regard to safety and design maybe made also.

Stockholm Embassy siege In 1975 Hausner was handpicked by Siegfried Haag to lead the group, known as Kommando Holger Meins who conducted the West German Embassy siege in Stockholm to force the release of 26 of his RAF comrades. Hausner was in charge of the wiring of the explosives. Twelve hours into the occupation, the explosives (15 kilogrammes of TNT) were apparently accidentally detonated. In the documentary film Stockholm 75, fellow Kommando Holger Meins member Karl-Heinz Dellwo discussed the explosion and explained that only he and Siegfried Hausner were in a position near the detonator to trigger it and that he did not know why it exploded, only that he didn't activate it. While fellow Kommando Holger Meins member Ulrich Wessel was killed instantly (the explosion causing him to drop a hand grenade), Hausner was severely wounded in the explosion, with burns to over 40% of his body and a fractured skull. Despite the recommendations of Swedish doctors, Hausner was immediately flown back to West Germany and hospitalized in Stammheim Prison, which had neither the equipment or specialist staff to treat severe burns. According to deputy chief prison officer Horst Bubeck, Hausner had \\"no chance of surviving, as the doctors saw immediately\\". He died on 5 May from a Pulmonary edema. His hurried relocation to Germany, the quality of treatment he received at Stammheim, and his subsequent death led many to blame both the West German government for killing him and the Swedish government for agreeing to his deportation despite being severely injured. Legacy After his death, Siegfried Hausner became a martyr to the cause (along with other late terrorists, such as Holger Meins and Petra Schelm). When Siegfried Buback was assassinated in April 1977, the RAF claimed responsibility in honor of Ulrike Meinhof and Siegfried Hausner. In the final video recording of kidnapped Hanns Martin Schleyer made before his murder by the RAF in October 1977, Schleyer is seen holding a placard that read, ‚ÄúCommando Siegfried Hausner.‚Äù The terrorist group involved in Operation Leo planned to rename their unit \\"Commando Siegfried Hausner\\" in honour of the deceased extremist before their plot failed. Some believe that the assassination of Sweden's prime minister Olof Palme on 28 February 1986 was in retaliation for his allowing Hausner to be deported.

The ATSB is the federal government body responsible for investigating transport-related accidents and incidents within Australia. It covers air, sea and rail travel. The ATSB is an independent Commonwealth Government statutory agency, governed by a Commission and is separate from transport regulators, policy makers and service providers.  History  The ATSB was formed on 1 July 1999. It combined the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), Marine Incident Investigation Unit (MIIU) and parts of the Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS). Its central office is located at 62 Northbourne Avenue in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. It has field offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. It has about 100 employees, including about 60 Transport Safety Investigators of aviation, marine, and rail accidents and incidents. = Air safety investigation = Australian aviation accidents were initially investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Committee (AAIC), formed in 1927, to \\"investigate all civil and military aircraft accidents that the Committee deemed advisable\\". When the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) was formed in 1938, investigation of air safety came within its purview. During the 1950s, the Air Safety Investigation Branch (ASIB) was formed, becoming the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) in 1982, an operationally independent unit of the Department of Aviation (DoA). In 1987, BASI was transferred to the Department of Transport and Communications (DoTaC) when DoA was abolished. Currently, the ATSB is responsible for investigating civil aircraft incidents and accidents within Australia and assisting in investigations of Australian registered aircraft overseas. Australia is a Council member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). = Marine safety investigation = The Marine Incident Investigation Unit (MIIU) was created on 1 January 1991, under the direction of the Inspector of Marine Accidents, a statutory position. Previously, significant marine accident investigations were conducted by a Court of Marine Inquiry, a model which was adopted in 1921, via amendment to the Navigation Act 1912 (Cwlth). This was based on United Kingdom law and practices dating back to the 1850s. Currently, the ATSB investigates accidents and serious incidents of Australian flagged ships worldwide, and of foreign flagged ships within Australian waters. Australia is a Council member of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). = Road Safety Branch = Between July 1999 and March 2008, Federal government initiatives dealing with road safety were primarily within the ATSB's responsibilities in the Road Safety Branch (RSB). The RSB later became part of 'The Infrastructure and Surface Transport Policy Division' of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. = Rail safety investigation = Until formation of the ATSB, rail safety had been the responsibility of each state government. With the enactment of the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (Cwlth), the ATSB gained jurisdiction for rail incident and accident investigations on the Defined Interstate Rail Network (DIRN), consisting of the standard gauge track linking all major Australian mainland cities and ports. In December 2009, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to adopt the ATSB as the national rail safety investigator, in conjunction with the formation of a national rail safety regulator. Commencing in January 2013, all Australian states and territories gradually adopted the scheme, with Queensland the last to join in July 2017. The Office of Transport Safety Investigations (OTSI) and the Chief Investigator Transport Safety (CITS), continue to investigate rail accidents and incidents in conjunction with the ATSB, in New South Wales and Victoria, respectively.  ATSB operations  The ATSB contributes to transport safety by independently investigating, analysing and openly reporting on transport safety matters. It is not a function of the ATSB to apportion blame or liability, instead, investigations are focused on learning from accidents and incidents and, encouraging safety action by government and industry. The ATSB is entirely separate from transport regulatory authorities such as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR), government policy makers and, service providers such as Airservices Australia and the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC). This separation ensures the independence of ATSB investigations, thereby avoiding external influence and conflicts of interest. The Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (TSI Act), allows the ATSB to investigate transport safety matters in the aviation, marine and rail transport modes within the Australian Government's constitutional jurisdiction and, to release transport safety information, including investigation reports that detail the findings and significant factors that led to a particular transport safety occurrence. ATSB Transport Safety Investigators exercise statutory powers delegated by the Chief Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of the TSI Act. These powers allow ATSB investigators to interview anyone involved directly or indirectly in a transport safety occurrence. A comprehensive regime of provisions within the TSI Act is in place to maintain the confidentiality of, and legal protection for, a range of sensitive safety information gathered by ATSB investigators.

They provide a form of procedure call.  History  Doors were developed by Sun Microsystems as a core part of the Spring operating system, then added to Solaris in version 2.5 as an undocumented internal interface. They became a documented feature in Solaris 2.6. Recent versions of Solaris use Doors in many places, including \`nscd\` (the name service cache daemon) and syslog. A Linux port of Doors was released in 2003, but is only available for version 2.4.18.http://www.rampant.org/doors/index.html  Overview  The Doors subsystem is implemented as a user-space library with some kernel support, and relies heavily on threads. It is designed for low overhead, and the Solaris implementation uses some assembly code for maximum efficiency. Doors are created by server processes (which must use threads) and called by client processes. It is possible for one process to both create and call a door. When creating a door, the server must specify a server procedure, which will be called by the Doors library on behalf of clients. Unlike most remote procedure call systems, each door has only one server procedure. A server can \\"attach\\" a door to a file, enabling clients to connect to that door simply by opening that file. The \`ls -l\` command will then show the file with a 'type' of \\"D\\" (not to be confused with \\"d\\" for a directory) ‚Äî for example: \` Drw-r--r-- 1 jmorrison dev 876 Dec 8 19:43 myfile\` Clients use \`door_call()\` to invoke the door's server procedure, passing a contiguous region of memory and a list of file descriptors as arguments, and getting back another contiguous region and list of file descriptors. Either region may be empty, as may either list. Usually, two C \`struct\`s will be defined, one for the input data and one for the output data. (Alternatively, tagged unions may be used, allowing a door procedure to provide multiple actions in much the same way as the ioctl system call.) Every file descriptor is accompanied by a flags word. The DOOR_RELEASE flag requests that a file descriptor be closed in the sending process after being duplicated in the receiving process. If a file descriptor that refers to a door is sent, the system records the properties of that door in the flags word. As well as representing a procedure, or a group of procedures, a door can represent a stateful data object, making it possible to pass references to such objects between processes. Such a door would typically take a tagged union as input data with each tag value denoting a different method. The Doors system also provides a way for clients and servers to get information about each other. For example, a server can check the client's user credentials or process ID to decide whether the client is allowed to do something. The Doors library normally creates and manages a pool of threads in the server process to handle calls, but it is possible to override this behaviour. The Doors system does not provide any form of synchronization, but servers can use the normal thread-level synchronization primitives. Doors can be used to synchronize access to shared memory segments, allowing single-copy data transfer.http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/fastSockets.html The Doors concept is very similar to X/Open XATMI API specification, where client processes invoke server processes' exposed functions. In clients, tpcall() is an analogue of door_call() and, in server processes, tpreturn() is an analogue of door_return().

History =Origins= Notwithstanding several and varied origin traditions, the MacTavishes may have come from Ireland to Scotland during the years of the Scoto-Irish settlement era. Very old Irish forms (O.F. Gaeilge) of MacTavish are given by Father Patrick Woulfe in his widely accepted work on Irish Surnames. Wolfe gives several old forms (O.F.) of the name, showing nominative, genitive, and accusative forms, eight in all, along with their modified and modern equivalents.Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall (Irish Names and Surnames)WoulfeGill & Son1906pages 22, 74, 75, 84, and 97 Substantiating this is the 15th or 16th century document writ known as the Cert Ui Neill (Irish), taken from much older Irish documents, and refers to past times rather than the contemporary. There is reference to the MacTavish (O.F.) holding lands in Ros Buill (old kingdom of Ross Guill) now encompassing part of County Donegal. The translation of the Ceart is found in Studia Celtica.Studia CelticaUniversity of Wales Press1969-1970pages 1-18 John O'Hart also gives two forms of the modern MacTavish, as well as an old form in Irish Pedigrees, The Origin and Stem of the Irish NationIrish Pedigrees, The Origin and Stem of the Irish NationO‚ÄôHartDuffy and Co.1892page 855 Another source for an Irish MacTavish origin is the Topographical Poems of O‚ÄôDubhagain, c. 1372, that illustrates what the origin of the MacTavishes appears to be. Under the subheading of \\"The Part of the Tir Chonaill\\", that is Conal Gulban's Land (often cited as what is now County Donegal, Ireland) is this entry on page 43, \\"To MacGillatsamhais the stout Belong Ros-Guill and Ros-Iroguil\\".Topographical Poems of O‚ÄôDubhagain c. 1372Irish Arch√¶logical and Celtic SocietyRoyal Irish Academy1862page 43 Ros-Guill and Ros-Irguill, agreeing with the \\"Ceart\\", was once ruled by what can be termed the Boar Kings, who are clearly denoted in the Irish Annuls; with Nuada Uirc (Old Irish: Orc or Boar) being noted as one of the line of kings of Guill and Irgull. Given in the Fragmentary Annuls of Ireland 178 is \\"Nuada Uirc, ri Guill & Irguill\\".https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G100017/text009.html Uirc or Orc, the kings of Ross Guill and Irgull are held synonymous with a boar, and the Crest Badge of the MacTavishes is a boars head. The location noted for both the Boar Kings and the ancient Irish race of MacTavish being the same. It is commonly held by the Campbells that Clan MacTavish descends from T√†mhas (Taus/Tavis Coir), son of Colin Mael Maith and a daughter of Suibhne Ruadh (Sween the Red of Castle Sween). Nothing certain is known of Taus Coir other than that he is listed in several traditional genealogies. The 17th century genealogy Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells traces Colin Mael Maith back to the mythological King Arthur. Furthermore, this record references Colin Mael Maith as having one legitimate son and two illegitimate sons. The Accompt gives the legitimate son as \\"Gillespic\\" (Gilleasbaig) or \\"Archibald\\", ancestor of Clan Campbell; and the two illegitimate sons as T√†mhas Ce√†rr (\\"Taius Coir\\") and Iomhar (\\"Iver\\"), ancestors of the MacTavishes and Clan MacIver. According to Alastair Campbell of Airds, a more probable candidate for the ancestor of the clan, rather than the possibly mythological T√†mhas Ce√†rr, is the historical Sir Thomas Cambel. Earlier in the 1970s, W. D. H. Sellar was also of the same opinion about Thomas. In 1292 Thomas' name is recorded on a list of landowners in the sheriffdom of Kintyre. In 1296 he signed the Ragman Roll as \\"Thomas Cambel among king's tenants in Perthshire\\". The next year he was released from imprisonment in the Tower of London. In 1308 he signed his name on a letter to the King of France. He was possibly dead by 1324, when his probable son, Duncan, was granted lands in Argyll for services rendered. In 1355, Duncan is listed as among \\"the Barons of Argyll\\" at an inquest in Inverleckan, under the name of \\"Duncanus MacThamais\\". As mentioned in Popular Tales of the West Highlands,J.F. Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands, Volume 4, Gardner, 1893, page 234 The Craignish Manuscript was drawn up by Alexander Campbell, in the employ of the Duke of Argyll, about 1706, and resulted from an examination of archives and charters, and the original genealogies drawn up by the MacEwens, heritable sheannachies [Gaelic: seanachaidh] of the Campbell chiefs of Argyll about 1650‚Äì1660, and gives Tavish Corr's parentage as different from Thomas Cambell, cited by Campbell of Airds, preceding. The Manuscript History cites Cailien Maol Maith as the father of Tavis, about 1100. The Manuscript History's content, considering the examination of multiple sources used to produce it, is closer in historical time frame than any other descriptive work, and therefore might be more accurate. Tweed mentions that Tavis' father, Cailien (Colin) Maol Maith, died at the siege of Dunstaffnage in 1110. A possible time frame for the birth of Tavis would then be somewhere around 1100‚Äì1111, based in part upon the texts of the old MacEwen sheannachies. Alastair Campbell of Airds says, \\"It seems probable that later compilers of the official genealogy, Ane Accompt (of the Genealogie of the Campbells), did not know of Sir Thomas \\"Cambel\\" and were anxious to insert the MacTavishes into the account somehow.\\" This would appear as very odd explanation since the MacEwens recorded the Campbell genealogies over the course of many years. Seannachies would not have omitted someone as important as Thomas Cambel, who swore fealty to Edward I, King of England in the 1296 Ragman Roll. Alastair Campbell of Airds also says, \\"I doubt if it can be shown that the eponym of any Highland family is a fictitious character.\\", but Alastair Campbell of Airds places Tavis Corr in this predicament, and has referred to the clan as Tavish Campbells, insinuating the MacTavishes are Campbell descendants.A History of Clan Campbell: From Origins to Flodden (Vol. 1)Campbell of AirdsPolygon2000page 12 Histiographer William Skene noted: \\"The policy of the Argyll family led them to employ every means for the acquisition of property and the extension of the clan. One of the arts, which they used for the latter purpose, was to compel those clans which had become dependent upon them to adopt the name of Campbell, and this, when successful, was generally followed at an after period by the assertion that the clan was descended from the house of Argyll. In general, the clans thus adopted into the race of Campbell, are sufficiently marked out by their being promoted only to the honour of being an illegitimate branch, but tradition of the country invariably distinguishes between the real Campbells and those who were compelled to adopt their name.\\"\\"The Highlanders of Scotland\\"Wm. F. Skene, MurrayLondon1837page 252 Tavis Corr, and his descendants (the MacTavishes) fit William Skene's description. Tavis Corr could well be a real person in history. In fact, a local historian, the elderly Miss Nancy MacLeod, owner of Springbank house, told Sheriff-Substitute James Robertson, at Tobermory, the MacTavishes were descended from \\"Tavish mor MacMhieCalain\\" (That is: great Tavish, son of Calain, Cailien, or Colin).James Robertson‚Äôs Journalselfentry of Friday, 19 July 1844. The MacTavish Chiefs, did not, and do not consider themselves descendants of any of the Campbells, but from an Irish Pictish (Cruithni/Cruithne) origin. The Scottish Annual and Book of the Braemar Gathering of 1957, has recorded that Clan MacTavish is one of the ORIGINAL Scottish clans.The Scottish Annual and Book of the Braemar GatheringHerald PressArbroath1957page 229 1957 is during the 200-year dormancy of the Chiefship of Clan MacTavish, and a full 40 years (1997) before Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish was recognized by Lord Lyon, Sir Malcolm Innes of Edingigh, as the Chief of Clan MacTavish. A clan is NOT a sept of another Clan. Clan MacTavish is distinct from Clan Campbell.http://clanmactavish.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/06/Lyon-Letter-_-MacTavish-_-2000.pdf An interesting reference for the early beginnings of the MacTavish comes from the oldest learned society in Great Britain, the Philological Society of London. Its publication states, \\"...our author's father was married to a daughter of Campbell of Ashfield, and her mother was a daughter of MacTavifh, or Thomfon of Dunardary (type/spelling as shown). This is a very ancient and respectable family, who have inherited the estate of Dunardary for upwards of nine hundred years.\\", and this is echoed in The Scots Magazine of 1793. If the MacTavishes were present at Dunardry 900 years prior to the 1793 date of two separate publications, that year would be approximately 893 AD. A MacTavish presence at Dunardry 900 years prior to the Campbell's presence in 1220 produces a difficult situation for a Campbell descent, as presented by Campbell history. Supporting an earlier time frame for the MacTavishes is the Reverend John Dewar, of Argyll, who noted that there were Dalriadic landowners in Argyll who were not Campbells. Rev. Dewar mentions specifically; The MacArthurs, The MacLachlans, The MacNeills, and The MacTavishes. It is difficult to reconcile the inconsistencies presented about the origins of the MacTavishes, or that the MacTavishes are descended of the Campbells (having been considered a sept of Clan Campbell for generations), considering the Dunardry settlement date of approximately 893 A.D. The Inverary Castle Website, approved by the 13th Duke of Argyll has listed, \\"The Campbells arrived in Argyll as part of a royal expedition in c.1220.\\"https://www.inveraray-castle.com/clan-campbell/the- campbell-family How or why these inconsistencies abound is mysterious, and not easily recitfied. Interestingly, the MacTavishes appeared to have similar political aims that aligned them with the Campbell chiefs. The 10th Duke of Argyll, Niall Diarmid Campbell mentions, \\"'Though the MacTavishes were never a large or powerful clan, they have nevertheless been deemed a brave and honourable race and numbers of them still live in Argyll under their old patronymic. Though the clan as a whole never seem to have made the slightest sign of adopting the name Campbell, they followed always the bratach or banner of the Lords of Lochow in war and all hostings.The Clan TavishN.D. Campbellself publishedc. 1870 page=2 The chiefly line of MacTavishes are styled \\"MacTavish of Dunardry\\" (the Gaelic D√πn √Ärd-R√¨gh means \\"fort of the High King\\"). The meaning of Dunardry is displayed on the Forestry Commission Map of Dunardry.https://www.searchforsites.co.uk/image.php?src=31595_1529694530.jpg It is unknown who built the castle of Dunardry, or even when it was built. The castle is marked on a 1634 Timothy Pont map, the location being Knapdale, Argyll. It was renovated in 1704 by Duncan MacTavish, and according to the 19th-century historian G.D. Mathews, it was owned by the MacTavishes. Today little of it exists, as it was torn down to make way for the Crinan Canal venture, which also changed the size, shape and water level of Loch a' Bharain.The West of Scotland Archaeology Service Report WoSAS Site ID: 4164 The West of Scotland Archaeology report on Dunardry, mentions that the site is either medieval or post medieval, which makes Dunardry an ancient site. =Battle of Flodden= The Battle of Flodden, Flodden Field, or occasionally Branxton (Brainston Moor) was a military combat in the War of the League of Cambrai between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland, resulting in an English victory.Battle of Flodden This was the bloodiest and most costly battle (in number of lives lost) ever fought by Scotland. It is said that every Noble family in Scotland suffered a loss, with estimates of death ranging from 4000 to 17,000 (17,000 is likely an exaggerated number).The Trustworthiness of Border Ballads, Elliot, Blackwood and Sons, 1906, page 136 The Battle claimed the lives of, Duncan, 6th Chief of MacTavish, Ean (Ewin or John), the 7th Chief of Clan MacTavish (the heir), Duncan's brother, Allan, and other MacTavishes, and Campbells, including the 2nd Earl of Argyll.History of Clan MacTavish, P.L.

In 1690, Campbell of Auchinbreck petitioned for ¬£20,000 Scots in compensation for the murder of his uncle during the siege and the damage caused to Carnasserie. After the Castle was surrendered to MacLean's forces, under a treaty (supposedly peacefully) they hanged young Dugald MacTavish, Fiar of Dunardry within \\"Bow Draught\\" (length of the flight of an arrow) of the Castle.Ladies of the Covenant, Anderson, Black & Son, 1862, pages 520, 626,627 Among the most tragic sufferers in Knapdale was Marie Campbell, widow of John MacTavish of Dunardry, whose son Dugald had been hanged at Carnassary.Kintyre in the Seventeenth Century, Andrew McKerral, Oliver and Boyd, 1948, page 50 Dougal MacTavish who was a younger son of John MacTavish, 12th chief of Clan MacTavish, was killed during the Battle of Stirling (1648). The chief of Clan MacTavish having lost most of his arms in the battle (sword and musket), the Marquess of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, provided him with new weapons. =18th century and Jacobite uprisings= In 1715 the Jacobite cause saw its first failed attempt to place the Stuarts back on the throne of Scotland and England. During this time Chief Archibald MacTavish was sympathetic to the Jacobite cause but took no action to support either the Government or the Jacobites. Chief Archibald is said to have signed the address welcoming the Pretender, James Stewart, King du jour in Exile.\\"Pertaining to the Jacobites in Argyll\\" GEORGE I. (1 August 1714‚Äî11 June 1727). From: Argyll Charters (ca AUG) 1715. In 1745 both Chief Archibald and Dugald MacTavish, the Younger, were imprisoned at Dumbarton Castle, in September 1745 during the 1745 Jacobite Rising. For this reason there was no formal leadership of Clan MacTavish of Dunardry within the Jacobite Army, and some of the MacTavishes found their own way to fight within the ranks of their neighbor, MacIntosh. The MacTavishes were imprisoned based on the \\"treasonable\\" letters from Dugald MacTavish, the younger, to Sir James Campbell of Achinbreck indicating plans to raise their men in favor of Prince Charles and the Jacobite cause.Sheriff Advocate Records, Argyll, Argyll & Bute, Archives On 16 April 1746 at the Battle of Culloden, the Jacobite army was defeated by a much larger force of the British government army (5000 fighting for Prince Charles and 9000 fighting for the government). On that day, the Jacobite army of Prince Charles lost the battle, and the fate of the Jacobite cause was sealed. =After Culloden= What took place after the battle of Culloden in 1746 (Jacobite Rebellion or Rising of the '45) broke the Highlanders and their chiefs, those who had supported the Stuart Jacobite cause. The decision was made to crush the power of the Highlanders and destroy their traditional way of living.\\"The chiefs no longer had power to levy military service over their clansmen, nor could they control what the government was doing in the Highlands, or for that matter in the Lowlands, where most of the Lowland families had supported the English Government. \\"The property of those who had joined the rebellion was confiscated, and the 'Forfeited Estates' were administered directly by the government in pursuit of a policy of breaking up the Highlanders' way of life.

In 1797, three years after work was started on the Crinan Canal, which subsequently divided the estate, Dunardry was purchased by Simon McTavish of Montreal, from Stratherrick, Invernesshire. Simon McTavish was born of the Garthbeg branch of the family and at this time was probably the richest man in Canada. Some Stratherrick McTavishes were considered a sept of Clan Fraser.Alexander Mackenzie. 1896.

Mackenzie, printed by The \\"Scottish Highlander\\" Office, pp. 697-699. Lachlan's son John George McTavish soon became a fur trader with the North West Company under Simon's patronage. However, the Dunardry Estate passed to Simon's son William, and then to Simon Jr. (both died young), and the property revered back to Lachlan's son, Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry,WS, who sold it to Malcolm of Poltallach.Legal Decreet dated 31 July 1829 (NAS: FILE CS32/20/53) =20th century= Back in the 18th century Lachlan's son, Dugald, under age in 1796, did not register the MacTavish arms; and as a grown man, with his duties as the Sheriff Substitute of Kintyre he obviously did not feel inclined to do so, as he was, already, legally known as MacTavish of Dunardry. He died without having re-registered the Arms. Unfortunately, this carried on with his son William MacTavish who had moved to the \\"wilds\\" of Canada. William also declined to register the Arms. It is nominally suggested by Lord Lyon that at least every other generation re-register the Chiefly Arms, to avoid dormancy of the Clan. As a result of William not matriculating for the arms, the Chiefly line was considered \\"lost\\", or dormant, until 1949, when the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, contacted the MacTavish family in Canada, advising them that they were the Chiefly line, inviting them to petition for the Arms and Chiefship of the Clan. No petition was lodged with the Court of Lord Lyon and the Chiefship remained dormant when, in 1992 Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish petitioned for the Arms and Chiefship of the clan. He was recognized and matriculated to the Titles of Chief of the Name and Arms, and Chief of the Clan MacTavish in 1997. The Chiefship was reinstated with the territorial title of MacTavish of Dunardry. =Revival= The search for the rightful heir to the Chiefship of Clan MacTavish was found when Mrs. Margaret MacLeaod was writing The Letters of Letitia Hargrave (Letitia MacTavish Hargrave was the daughter of Sheriff Dugald MacTavish at Campbeltown, Kintrye, Scotland) for the Champlain Society. Mrs. MacLeod's husband, Allan MacLeod, M.D., had taken over the medical practice of one James MacTavish, son of the Governor William MacTavish, HBC, at Red River. Mrs. MacLoed stumbled onto the connection through her research and wrote to the Lord Lyon King of Arms,Winnipeg Press Press (newspaper)Friday, 27 Julyyear 1951page 11 who in turn had contacted the MacTavish family in Canada in 1950, advising them of the heir-ship and urging J.W.

Clan MacTavish experienced a dormancy of 200 years when Lachlan MacTavish was the last Chief to register at that time. The dormancy ended in 1997 when Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry matriculated. His son, Steven Edward Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry is the current Chief of Clan MacTavish. William MacTavish, Hudson's Bay Company Governor of Assiniboia and Rupert's Land (afterwards Manitoba) whose great grandson, Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry, was matriculated by the Court of the Lord Lyon 23 July 1997 and granted the Arms and Title of Chief of the Clan MacTavish of Dunardry, and Chief of the Name and Arms of MacTavish, being so recognized, he became the 26th Chief of the Clan in an unbroken line. He died on 19 June 2005 at his home in Vancouver, BC.

This name is a patronymic form of the Gaelic personal name Tamhus' (pronounced Tavus or Tavis), which is translated to Thomas in English. \\"The Pict word for twin was TAUUS (pronounced tavis). It became Tamhais in Gaelic and Tavish in English.\\"Chronicles of the Picts (LLAWRYDD GAN ALBANNWRYDDH), Rev. 8MacGregorNOBOLIS PUB.2014page 139 The Gaelic name Mac Tamhais is pronounced similarly to 'MacTavis' or 'MacTavish' (the \\"mh\\" in Gaelic pronounced as the \\"v\\" in the English word \\"very\\"). In old charters, the name had many variant spellings. Some spellings found within old Scottish charters, post-Culloden parish registers, and in \\"The Commons Argyll\\" appear as MacAvis, MacCamis, McCawis,McKavis, McKnavis, M'Ash, MacAnish, mcTais, MacTavifh and mcThavish, to give a few. It seems that from near the end of the 17th century, the spellings, MacTavish and/or Thom(p)son or Thomas were the most common.

The crest is blazoned a boar's head erased or langued proper. The motto is NON OBLITUS, which seems to translate from Latin as \\"not forgetful\\". But this is only one translation. Latin authorities often site non-oblitus associated with funerary text, in which the deceased is commemorated. Thus, Non oblitus post mortem me, expounds the sentiment, \\"Do not forget me after death\\". Non Oblitus standing alone expounds \\"Not Forgotten\\". It would then seem unlikely that the MacTavish motto would be an echoing of the Campbell Motto, Ne Obliviscaris, \\"Not Forgetful\\" (which is the correct translation); which seems to be so often translated as, \\"Do Not Forget\\". The MacTavish family name was wrongfully claimed by Clan Campbell, during the 200-year period when the chiefly line was \\"lost\\", until 1997 when the \\"Chief of the Clan MacTavish\\" was recognized by the Lord Lyon. Chiefly arms In 1793, John Hooke-Campbell, Lord Lyon King of Arms, granted the following coat of arms to Lachlan MacTavish of Dunardry: Quarterly, 1st and 4th a Gyronny of eight Sable and Or; 2nd and 3rd, Argent, a buck's head cabossed Gules attired Or on a chief engrailed Azure a cross crosslet fitch√®e between two mullets Or. Crest a boar's head erased Or langued Gules. Motto: NON OBLITUS. These arms were record in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland, Volume 1, Folio 563, dated 17 April 1793. The arms display in the first and fourth quarters the gyronny prominent in Campbell heraldry reversed for difference. Apparently the gynronnies were included by the Campbell Lord Lyon because the MacTavishes had been followers (not a sept) of the Campbells since their occupation of Argyll. The second and third quarters are similar to, but differenced from Thomson of that Ilk, apparently because Tavish translates to Thomas, and MacTavish bears the meaning of \\"Son of Tavis/Thomas\\". On 13 December 1997, the Lord Lyon affixed his seal on the matriculation of Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry, recognizing him as Chief of Clan MacTavish, granted him arms similar to the grant of 1793 as follows. Quarterly, On 1st and 4th a Gyronny of eight Sable and Or; 2nd and 3rd, Argent, a buck's head cabossed Gules attired Or on a chief engrailed Azure a cross crosslet fitch√®e between two mullets Argent. Crest a boar's head erased Or langued Gules. Motto: NON OBLITUS. The Cross crosslet and mullets were changed from Or (gold) to Argent (silver), but this change wants for a reason. In 2002 the Lord Lyon King of Arms re-granted Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry arms with certain amendments. Lord Lyon switched the Campbell gyronny from the first and fourth quarters to the second and third quarters. The new arms are blazoned Quarterly, 1st and 4th, Argent, a Buck's Head cabossed Gules attired Or on a Chief engrailed Azure a cross crosslet fitch√®e between two mullets of the First; 2nd and 3rd, Gyronny of eight Sable and Or. Above the Shield is placed a Helm befitting his degree with a Mantling Azure doubled Argent, and on a Wreath of the Liveries is set for Crest a boar's head erased Or langued Proper, and in an Escrol over the same this Motto \\"NON OBLITUS\\". On 30 August 2013 The Court of the Lord Lyon matriculated new arms for Chief Steven MacTavish of Dunardry as follows: Quarterly, first and fourth, Argent, a buck's head Gules attired Or, on a chief engrailed Azure a cross-crosslett between two mullets Argent, second, gyronny of eight Sable and Or; and third, Argent a lymphad sails furled or in action Sable flagged Gules. Above the Shield is place an Helm befitting his degree, with mantling Gules doubled Argent, and on a wreath of the liveries is set for crest, a boar's head erased Or langued Proper, and in an scroll over the same this Motto 'NON OBLITUS'. Recorded on the 98th page, of the 91st Volume of the Public Register of All Arms and Bearing in Scotland. The addition of a Lymphad (ancient sailing ship) was added as the petitioner showed that this adamant was historical as used by a MacTavish ancestor.

Stand Up and Cheer! is a 1934 American Pre-Code musical film directed by Hamilton MacFadden. The screenplay by Lew Brown and Ralph Spence was based upon a story idea by Will Rogers and Philip Klein. The film is about efforts undertaken during the Great Depression to boost the morale of the country. It is essentially a vehicle for a string of vaudeville acts and a few musical numbers. The film is best known for providing the first big breakthrough role for legendary child actress Shirley Temple. A little known bit player before the film, by the end of the year, she appeared in 10 movies, including 4 starring roles in major feature-length films. Plot The President of the United States decides that the true cause of the Great Depression (raging when the film was released) is a loss of \\"optimism\\" as a result of a plot by financiers and bankers who are getting rich from the Depression. The President then appoints Lawrence Cromwell as secretary for the newly created Department of Amusement. Cromwell creates an army of entertainers and sends them out across the country. Much of the action centers around Cromwell auditioning acts in his office (with interruptions from janitor \\"George Bernard Shaw\\", played by Stepin Fetchit). At the end, as a musical production number breaks forth, Cromwell looks out of his office window and sees the Depression literally, instantaneously lift. Cast * Warner Baxter as Lawrence Cromwell * Madge Evans as Mary Adams * Shirley Temple as Shirley Dugan * James Dunn as Jimmy Dugan * Nigel Bruce as Eustis Dinwiddle * Ralph Morgan as Secretary to President * Stepin Fetchit as \\"George Bernard Shaw\\" * Tess Gardella as Aunt Jemima * Scotty Beckett as Auditioning Boy * John Boles as Himself * Dick Foran as Himself (billed as Nick) Production During production, the film was known as \\"Fox Follies\\".Variety, February 22, 1934 Perhaps the most memorable scene in the movie was the song and dance number by James Dunn and Shirley Temple titled \\"Baby Take a Bow\\". Temple, who was signed to a $150/week contract initially guaranteed for just two weeks while the film was in full production, did not have enough time to learn the dance routine for the film and instead used a routine she learned from Meglin's. Dunn then learned the routine from her. In recording the sound track for the song, her voice accidentally cracked on the last note, but the producers actually liked it and kept it in. Before filming the dance routine, she slipped and fell while walking in, cutting her head. To remedy this, her mother covered the cut with a spit curl. As filming of the dance number started, Temple's potential quickly became apparent. By the time she was finished, she was brought straight into Fox Film offices and had her contract extended to a year with a seven-year option. The number became so popular that it would serve as the title to her next film, Baby Take a Bow, also starring Dunn. Reception =Critical reception= Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"often comes close to a conception of what a modern Gilbert and Sullivan opus might be. It is true that there are several intrusive numbers which have little to do with the bright pivotal idea, but they have the virtue of being good entertainment.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker reviewed it as mediocre, writing it had \\"a few good numbers and a lot of very dreary libretto work.\\" Film Daily reported \\"Despite a weakness in construction that has left it with a few air pockets, this musical jamboree has several highlights that will suffice to satisfy the patrons and make them pass the word around.\\" It added that Shirley Temple \\"just about steals the show and leaves the customers hungry for more of her.\\" \\"Richly satiric, the story introduces hilarious types and presents a delightfully mad picture of Washington\\", wrote the New York Daily Mirror. The New York Herald Tribune wrote that it was \\"successful neither as musical comedy nor hilarious fantasy, but it must be granted certain pleasant features. Amazingly enough, one of them is a child actress.\\" The New York Daily News wrote that although it \\"was designed to wipe away our fears and blues over these hard times by insisting that the depression is over, I'm afraid it is going to have just the opposite effect. Little Shirley Temple earned the only burst of spontaneous applause.\\" The film was given a strong endorsement by Variety, especially the work of \\"newcomer\\" Shirley Temple, whom they cited as the film's \\"unofficial star.\\"Variety, April 24, 1934 Although modern scholars often point to the film as an example of typical Great Depression entertainment, Variety expressed reservations about its theme. \\"This musical is a hodge-podge principally handicapped by a national depression premise. Americans now like to think of themselves in the light of being on the upturn and having rounded that long- awaited corner, so Cheer's plot motivation is basically questionable [and] open to debate.\\" =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated Releases The film premiered April 19, 1934 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The film was a box office disappointment for Fox. Eleven minutes of footage were deleted for modern home video release, most of it racial in nature. In 2009, the film was available on both videocassette and DVD in the original black-and-white version and a computer-colorized version of the original. Some versions included theatrical trailers and other special features. Merchandise The polka-dot dress worn by Shirley Temple in her song and dance number with Dunn served as the model of the dress used on the first Shirley Temple dolls made by toy manufacturer Ideal in 1934. In 1958, Temple's television show, Shirley Temple's Storybook went into production. At the time, she persuaded various manufacturers to release ancillary merchandise including the Baby Take a Bow polka-dot dress (Edwards 233).

It was released in October, 2000 by Nitro Records and was the band's second release for the label following their first full-length album after leaving Indecision Records, Cast the First Stone. It was recorded in June, 2000 in New York City and at the same time the band produced two further tracks which appeared on the Death By Stereo/Ensign Split 7\\" (EP) on Indecision Records in December, 2000. The track, \\"Cast In Shadows\\" was later re-recorded and appeared on their next album for Nitro Records, The Price of Progression. Another track, \\"Left Hand Syndrome\\", was destined for the same release, according to the inlay details, but eventually was omitted. Overview As was heard from Cast the First Stone, the band was beginning to slow their approach to hardcore punk in its purest state. It was on this EP that the transition moved further forward. \\"Cast In Shadow\\" was a slow-paced, chugging song with variable vocal styles, from Tim Shaw's usual hardcore shout down to a hushed tone for the middle section. The title track and \\"Nine-One-Zero-Zero\\" perhaps sound more like the Ensign of old, a slow start moving into a fast-paced middle, but with a somewhat metalcore ending. The EP's closer, \\"Left Hand Syndrome\\", was perhaps somewhat of an experimental track for the band. Straying from the start directly into more melodic hardcore territory, such as that occupied by Good Riddance in \\"pop-punk\\" mode. Overall, the actual sound was quite different from Cast the First Stone, due mainly to the fact that Nate Gluck had assumed guitar duties as well as bass, and the raw production. The feel and style was most definitely a precursor for that of their next venture, The Price of Progression.

It is now a meat and brush-clearing type found widely in the United States. In the Southeast and elsewhere, they are often referred to as \\"wood\\" (Florida), \\"brush\\" or \\"briar\\" (North Carolina, South Carolina), \\"hill\\" (Virginia), and \\"scrub\\" (midwest Pennsylvania) goats. Until recently, these goats were kept mainly for clearing brush and other undesirable plant species from pasture lands. The boer goats have overtaken Spanish goats for meat in the 1980s. History Around the 16th century, Spanish explorers brought landrace goats from their native lands to the Caribbean Islands and areas that would later become the United States and Mexico. Some landrace Spanish goats exist in their native territory of Spain but survive through the bloodlines brought to the New World.ALBC - Spanish Goat American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. Retrieved on 2010-08-25 Spanish goats are hardy and can thrive in difficult environments. Pure Spanish goats have been crossbred with imported goat breeds for cashmere and meat production. Most crossbred goats show a ‚Äúsuperb hybrid vigor.‚Äù However, due to the amount of crossbreeding, Spanish goats are threatened, and appear on the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy watch list. Characteristics The Spanish goat has the ability to breed out of season, and is an excellent range animal because of its small udder and teats. In addition, Spanish goats are very hardy, able to survive and thrive under adverse agroclimatic conditions, with only limited management inputs. Within the general group of what are called \\"Spanish goats,\\" there are those that are purely of Spanish origins, but the term has been used to represent an amalgam of all genotypes introduced to the area. There have been obvious infusions of dairy and Angora blood in many \\"Spanish\\" herds, but no organized attempt has ever been made to use them for milk or mohair production. In recent years, the escalating demand for goat meat has focused research into the qualities of the Spanish goat as a meat goat. Spanish goats have shown excellent hardiness and have shown themselves to be a low-input goat compared to other meat breeds. Several Spanish goat producers in Texas have been intensively selecting for increased meat production for the past several years. From information obtained from these producers, these \\"selected\\" Spanish goats appear to greatly outperform the ordinary Spanish goat used primarily for pasture maintenance. Conservation status When Boer goats were introduced into the United States from South Africa in the 1990s, many producers switched from raising Spanish goats to raising Boer or Boer crosses, which greatly reduced the population of Spanish goats. In 2009, there were approximately 8,500 purebred Spanish goats nationwide. They are now held to be a conservation priority by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and in 2007 the Spanish Goat Association was organized to help conserve this breed. Today, fieldwork has been able to identify various strains of purebred Spanish goats. This fieldwork has been helpful in describing the different bloodlines and encourages development of a formal network of breeders. The ALBC is still locating populations of the Spanish goats and trying to work to preserve those strains. Recently there was an effort to preserve a strain found on an island off the coast of South Carolina. This strain is one of two strains known to exist in the Southeast.Hobby Farm- Preserving Spanish-goat Genes Hobby Farms.

Life Walter was born in Kahla, in present- day Thuringia, in 1496. According to a document filed with his will, he was born with the surname of Blanckenm√ºller, but adopted out of poverty by a citizen of Kahla, and given an education at Kahla and Rochlitz under his new name: Johann Walter. He began his career as a composer and bass cantor in the chapel of Frederick the Wise at the age of 21. It was a position he would hold until Frederick's death in 1525. By this time, he was the director of the chapel and had become an outspoken musical spokesman for Lutherans. Walter edited the first Protestant hymnal for choir, ', in Wittenberg in 1524, with a foreword by Martin Luther himself; and for the German-language Deutsche Messe produced in 1527. Following the conclusion of his appointment to Frederick's chapel, Walter became cantor for the Torgau town choir in 1525, a post he would hold until 1548, when he was named court composer for Moritz, Duke of Saxony in Dresden. Walter did not remain in Dresden very long, and by 1554 he had accepted a pension from the duke and returned to Torgau, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died on 25 March 1570. St Matthew Passion While in Dresden, Walter composed a responsorial Passion in German. In earlier musical versions of the Passion story the entire narrative was a succession of polyphonic motets, but Walter used a monophonic reciting tone for the Evangelist and dramatis personae, reserving for the people and disciples simple falsobordone (chordal) polyphony. Finnish ensemble Kuninkaantien muusikot (Musicians of the King's Road) has performed the Passion as a part of its early passions cycle. The performance took place in Turku Cathedral in 2017, the year of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. Musical works Walter wrote his motets and lieder, often of high quality, in two distinct styles. For the first style he employed a polyphonic manner derived from the Franco-Flemish school, in particular showing the influence of Josquin des Prez and Heinrich Isaac. In the tenor voice of these compositions was a cantus firmus sounding as an unbroken succession of sustained notes or as a melody fragmented into short sections separated by rests. Above and below the cantus firmus were counterpoints that sometimes imitated the tenor but more often moved independently of it. In either case the melodic flow of four or more voices avoided simultaneous rests. For the second style Walter rejected imitative or independent voice-leading for chorale writing in which each fragment of the cantus firmus rested simultaneously with the other parts. In a few such cases he placed the borrowed tune in the top voice, thereby inaugurating the favorite manner of chorale setting of the succeeding two centuries. Some of his more famous chorale settings include: *Allein auf Gottes Wort *Christ ist erstanden *Christ lag in Todes Banden *' *Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott *Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort *Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ *Joseph, lieber Joseph mein (Resonet in laudibus) *' *' *Laus Matrimonii ex Horatio (Felices ter) *Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist *' *Verbum caro factum est *' *Wo Gott der Herr nicht bei uns h√§lt Miscellaneous The asteroid 120481 Johannwalter is named in his honour.

The final lunar expedition plan in 1961 was for a 21-person underground Air Force base on the Moon by 1968 at a total cost of $7.5 billion. The primary distinction between the later Apollo missions and Lunex was the orbital rendezvous maneuver. The Lunex vehicle, composed of a landing module and a lifting body return/re-entry module, would land the entire vehicle and all astronauts on the surface, whereas the final Apollo mission involved a separate ascent module leaving the command module and service module connected in lunar orbit with a single astronaut. The original plan for Apollo was for direct ascent, similar to Lunex. Design details =Associated vehicles (estimates)= Lunex spacecraft concept Lunex Lunar Lander *Crew Size: 3 *Length: 16.16 m (53.01 ft) *Maximum Diameter: 7.62 m (24.99 ft) *Span: 7.62 m (24.99 ft) *Mass: 61 000 kg (134 000 lb) *Agency: USAF =Location= Selection of base sites were to be made by automated probes, with Kepler crater being a studied location. Background Lunex planned to make its first lunar landing and return in 1967, in order to beat the Soviets and demonstrate conclusively that America could win future international competition in technology with the USSR. The Air Force felt that no achievement short of a lunar landing would have the required historical significance. The use of the direct ascent profile was considered to be the most promising because it eliminated some of the complexities of the Lunar orbit rendezvous that would later be used by Apollo: in particular there would be no need to develop rendezvous techniques in space. The down side was that the Lunex spacecraft would be much heavier than Apollo to carry the extra fuel required to land the entire spacecraft on the Moon and return it to lunar orbit, and consequently a larger rocket would be required to send it to the Moon. =Implementation= Three milestones were set: *1965: recovery of a crewed reentry vehicle *1966: crewed circumlunar flight *1967: crewed lunar landing and return After 1968, a Permanently Crewed Lunar Expedition was planned. =Problems= The main problems to be solved were: * Re-entry at 37,000 feet per second, with the flight path within a two-degree angle to avoid overheating or skipping out of the Earth's atmosphere. The latter would not kill the crew directly, but would leave the Earth-return spacecraft in an elliptical orbit where they might be exposed to excessive radiation in the Van Allen belts before the next re-entry opportunity. * Development of the lunar landing stage, which would have to make a precision landing tail-first on rocket thrust: something never previously tested. * Development of the lunar launching stage, which had no backup capability, so must be extremely reliable and capable of automated checkout on the lunar surface, and capable of putting the crew into the correct orbit to return to Earth.

On July 31, 1965 in an interview with Dusty Vineberg of the Montreal Star, Owen attributed the success of High Steel to the fact that he wrote, directed, and edited it himself, calling this \\"a welding of three aspects of filmmaking that many young filmmakers increasingly insist is vital to integrity.\\" For his film on the Canadian Olympic runner Bruce Kidd he persuaded poet W. H. Auden to write and voice the narration. In 1966 he directed the acclaimed Notes for a Film About Donna and Gail and the following year he directed The Ernie Game, which was entered into the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. In later years, he directed a documentary titled Cowboy and Indian (1972), Partners (1976) and Turnabout (1988), along with an episode of the series Danger Bay (1988).

The municipality existed from 1868 until its dissolution in 1964. It was located in the northern part of the present-day municipality of Voss. The municipality was centered on the nearby villages of Vinje and Oppheim, where the two churches for the municipality are located: Vinje Church and Oppheim Church. The large lake Oppheimsvatnet sat in the central part of the municipality. The administrative centre was at Vasstrondi, on the south side of the lake Oppheimsvatnet. History Hotel Stalheim in Vossestrand The municipality of Vossestrand was created on 1 January 1868 when the old (large) municipality of Voss was divided. The northern part became Vossestrand and the southern part remained as Voss. Initially, Vossestrand had a population of 2,009. On 21 August 1869, an unpopulated area of Voss was administratively transferred to the municipality of Vossestrand. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.

The series stars Mary Tyler Moore in her return to series television after an absence of over six years, during which time she appeared on Broadway in Whose Life Is It Anyway? and in the dramatic film Ordinary People. After The Mary Tyler Moore Show, her subsequent ventures into series television on the variety shows Mary (1978) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979) had been short-running ratings disasters, and Moore decided to return to the sitcom format which had brought her the greatest television success; the sitcom nonetheless met the same fate as the variety shows. Synopsis In Mary, Moore plays Mary Brenner, a 40-ish divorc√©e working at a second rate tabloid, the Chicago Eagle. She was formerly a high-profile writer at a fashion magazine named Women's Digest, which recently went out of business, and she is now reduced to writing a consumer-assistance column, \\"Helpline\\", helping to expose substandard business practices and products and the often uncaring reaction of government to these problems. Her boss, Managing Editor Frank DeMarco (James Farentino), concentrates on sensationalism as he is convinced that that is what really sells papers. He is also quite a ladies' man, and is attracted to Mary, as she is to him, but she finds dealing with that situation to be quite awkward. Also working at the Eagle are the cynical, chain-smoking columnist Jo Tucker (Katey Sagal), the condescending theater critic Ed LaSalle (John Astin), and Tully (David Byrd), a copy editor who can scarcely function because he is going blind but knows he isn't going away; his job has strong protection from the union. Neighbors include Susan Wilcox (Carlene Watkins), Mary's good friend, whose fianc√© Lester Mintz (James Tolkan) seems to be somehow \\"connected\\". Change of name The newspaper was originally called Chicago Post. Chicago alderman Richard Mell, who owned a newspaper by that name, asked that the name be changed because \\"The Chicago Post is not a sleazy newspaper.\\" The producers changed the name before airing. Airing Throughout its run, Mary was paired with the sitcom Foley Square starring Margaret Colin, which also premiered on December 11, 1985, and aired at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesdays immediately after Mary at 8:00 p.m. Neither show ever really found much of an audience, and after Marys tenth episode aired on February 19, 1986, Mary went into hiatus, as did Foley Square after its eleventh episode was broadcast on February 26, 1986. Still paired, the two shows moved to Tuesdays and a later time slot in the hope of boosting their ratings. Broadcasts of both shows at the new day and time resumed on March 25, 1986, with Mary at 9:00 p.m. and Foley Square at 9:30 p.m. On Mary, Susan and Lester were written out and Marys personal life was generally downplayed in favor of her business one. There were some favorable reviews, although some critics pronounced it as more or less a clone of her previous sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show. With the two shows still suffering from poor ratings in their new time slots, CBS broadcast only three more episodes of each before cancelling both of them after the thirteenth episode of Mary and fourteenth episode of Foley Square aired on April 8, 1986.McNeil, Alex, Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming From 1948 to the Present, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, p. 293.Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, Sixth Edition, New York: Ballantine Books, 1995, , p. 364.

History Raymond Brutinel was born in Alet-les-Bains, Aude, France. He immigrated to Western Canada in 1904 where he helped survey the route for the Grand Trunk Railway. He went on to edit Le Courrier de l'Ouest in Edmonton, Alberta, the first French-language newspaper west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. A member of the Canadian army in World War I, Brutinel initiated and commanded the Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade, the first fully mechanized unit of the British Empire. In August 1914, Major Raymond Brutinel enrolled the first recruits for the Canadian Machine Gun Corps in the Ch√¢teau Laurier Hotel in Ottawa, Ontario. A memorial plaque with a circular \\"bas relief\\" of Brigadier-General Brutinel bust, and a \\"bas relief\\" of machine gunners on Vimy ridge are dedicated to the memory of Brigadier-General R. Brutinel, C.B. C.M.G. D.S.O. who commanded the Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade and the members of the Canadian Machine Gun Brigade who died on active service and in honour of those who served. His brigade played a significant part in halting the major German offensive of March 1918. From October 1916 until March 1918, Brutinel was Corps MG Officer of the Canadian Corps and, in addition to his decorations, he was seven times Mentioned in Dispatches. He pioneered the virtues of mobility and concentration of firepower and developed the concept of indirect machine-gun fire. In 1920 Brutinel returned to Europe, where he was a Creusot sales representative in the Balkans, but he retained many Canadian ties. Major-General Georges Vanier, Canadian ambassador to France and future Governor General of Canada, recorded the \\"considerable help\\" Brutinel provided in evacuating embassy staff from Paris in June 1940 in advance of the German occupation of France in World War II. In early July 1945, Winston Churchill holidayed in Brutinel's house, Chateau de Bordaberry, outside Hendaye in southwestern France, near the Spanish border.David Reynolds, \\"In Command of History,\\" Random House, 2005, p.3; http://lenfantroihendaye.webnode.fr/batiments/ Churchill then flew to Berlin for the Potsdam Conference during which he learned he had lost the 1945 election. In 1961 he became a member of the Canadian Institute of Mines and Metallurgy Fifty-Year Club. Raymond Brutinel died in 1964 at Couloum√©- Mondebat, Gers, France.

He had joined the Confederate Army shortly after the start of the Civil War but was discharged due to health reasons in 1864.  Early Life  Samuel Arnold was born in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. 6 September 1834. He was the son of Mary Jane and George Arnold, Sr. and had an older brother. The family later moved to Baltimore where Arnold attended St. Timothy's Hall, a military academy - where he and John Wilkes Booth were Schoolmates.  Role in Lincoln kidnapping conspiracy  After his discharge, Arnold returned to Baltimore and in late summer of 1864, he was recruited by Booth to be part of the kidnap plot. Bored and unemployed, Arnold accepted. 15 March 1865, the conspirators met at Gautier's Restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue to discuss the plot. Arnold and the other alleged conspirators, John Wilkes Booth, David Herold, Lewis Powell, Michael O'Laughlen, and John Surratt, were to kidnap Lincoln and hold him to exchange for the Confederate prisoners in Washington D.C.. This was attempted twice, but failed, because Lincoln was not where they thought he would be. After the failure, Arnold took a clerk's job in Old Point Comfort, Virginia.  Arrest and trial  After Booth assassinated Lincoln on April 14, 1865, Arnold was arrested from his job in Virginia on suspicion of complicity. He admitted his part in the plot to kidnap Lincoln, and his co-workers supported his contention of being in Virginia at the time of the assassination. During the trial, one of the chief witnesses was Louis J. Weichmann, a boarder at Mary Surratt's (John Surratt's mother).  Conviction and sentence  Arnold was found guilty by Military Commission and sentenced to life in prison at Fort Jefferson, along with Samuel Mudd, Michael O'Laughlen, and Edmund Spangler. In 1869 Arnold, Mudd and Spangler were released after being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson (O'Laughlen had died in prison in 1867).  Post-prison years and death  After Samuel Arnold returned home, he lived quietly out of the public eye for more than thirty years. In 1898 he returned to Fort Jefferson and took photographs of his old prison, but the photographs have not survived. In 1902 Arnold wrote a series of newspaper articles for the Baltimore American describing his imprisonment at Fort Jefferson. Arnold died four years later on September 21, 1906. He is buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland. The only conspirator who survived him was John Surratt.

Until 1975 it also included a high school. It was founded in 1908 by Katherine Delmar Burke and was named Miss Burke's School. Burke's is one of three all-girl K-8 schools in San Francisco. Burke's celebrated its centennial during the 2007‚Äì2008 school year. The school is a member of the California Association of Independent Schools. History Burke's first location in 1908 was at Steiner and Pacific Streets in Pacific Heights. It then relocated to a house at 2310 Broderick Street. In 1918 the growing school moved to a new building designed by architect Julia Morgan (a friend of Katherine Burke), located at 3065 Jackson Street. The school began acquiring property in Sea Cliff in 1929. At first only the Kindergarten and First grade were located there. The rest of the property was used as a sports venue for the upper classes. There was a large grass sports field, basketball courts, and 5 tennis courts. In 1949, grades 2 through 6 were moved there after the completion of new classrooms. The high school and grades 7 and 8 remained at the Jackson St. building until 1975, when Burke's high school closed and the building was acquired by San Francisco University High School.Tricia O'Brien, San Francisco's Pacific Heights And Presidio Heights (Arcadia Publishing, 2008), , pp. 76-77.

It is named for the U.S. Supreme Court's first African-American Justice, Thurgood Marshall. History The organization was established in 1987, under the leadership of Dr. N. Joyce Payne in cooperation with Miller Brewing Company, Sony Music, the NBA, Reebok and the American Association for State Colleges and Universities to Institutionally support the public HBCUs. It underwent a name change in 2006 from the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. TMCF has championed higher education at public historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and has grown from a small organization providing scholarships for public HBCUs, raising over $300 million to date for programmatic support, capacity building support and scholarships for its member-schools and the students matriculating on the campuses. Its mission differs from that of the United Negro College Fund, which supported approximately 65,000 students at 900 colleges and universities with approximately $113 million in grants and scholarships in 2015 alone while the Thurgood Marshall College fund only supports 47 schools; it is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, charitable organization, which means it does not pay taxes on its income. TMCF was granted $50 million in 2015 by Apple, $26.5 million in 2017 by the Charles Koch Foundation and Koch Industries, and $6 million by The Boeing Company in 2018. Acquisitions In 2013, TMCF acquired the Opportunity Funding Corporation (OFC), merging the two organizations with TMCF becoming the parent organization. Both organizations share a similar mission of providing service to the HBCU community, particularly in the area of talent identification. OFC, while continuing its efforts to enhance the entrepreneurship curriculum within public and private HBCUs, will now focus on identifying the most promising future entrepreneurs and introducing them to potential investors and very successful entrepreneurs.

Jack was a coal miner. Jack's nickname comes from the common practice of distinguishing local men (in an area known for its poverty of surnames) by the use of the wife's Christian or given name. Jack may be considered an archetypal trickster figure and the tales involve his various intrigues with hostile authority figures such as landlords, bailiffs and employers. His legendary activities celebrate his fecklessness and irresponsibility. Jack's quick tongue does not generally save him from the consequences of his actions but provides an ironic commentary on his plight and on the values of more respectable citizens. The popularity of the Jack Mary Ann tales may suggest an undercurrent of local opposition to the respectable and supposedly dominant norms of non-conformist Christianity generally held to be an expression of Welsh identity in this period. The tales Mary Ann fell one night ill and asked Jack to go for the doctor. Jack was reluctant to do so because he was afraid of being attacked while walking through a rough area at night. Eventually he grabbed a kitchen chair and made to leave. Mary Ann called Jack back and asked him what he wanted the chair for. Jack said that if he did meet anyone who wanted to fight him, he would tell them he was moving house secretly to avoid paying the rent and that there were five men behind him with the other chairs and the kitchen table. Jack and Mary Ann avoided paying rent on their cottage. One day a bailiff called to serve them with notice to quit. They hid when he knocked. He tried to push the notice under the door. Jack took the bellows from the fire and blew the notice back outside. As the bailiff walked away he was heard to remark, \\"No wonder Jack won't pay rent on a draughty old place like that!\\" The landlord decided to give up the struggle about the rent and called at the house one day and told Mary Ann he was going to give them the house. Jack returned from the pub and Mary Ann told him about their surprising good fortune. Jack asked Mary Ann if she'd accepted the house. When she said she had, he became angry: \\"You stupid woman! We paid nothing before, now we'll have to pay the rates!\\" Surprisingly, Jack used to work as a policeman. This ended when the new police inspector walked into a local pub which was still open after licensed hours and found Jack with a pint in one hand leaning on the pub piano leading the bar in a chorus. The inspector, amazed at this gross breach of duty, brought out his notebook intending to record Jack's name and offence, and asked Jack, \\"Who are you?\\" Jack replied, \\"I'm the bobby that's just lost his job\\".

The village is best known for Loughmoe Castle, seat of the Barons of Loughmoe. It is one half of the parish of Loughmore-CastleineyParishes in Cashel and Emly Diocese in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. Loughmoe gives its name to the civil parish of Loughmoe West which is in the historical barony of Eliogarty. Toponymy The village's Irish-language name Luach Maigh (earlier: Luach- mhagh) means \\"reward-field\\". Today's Loughmore - which would correspond to Irish Loch M√≥r (\\"great lake\\") - is the result of a mistake by British mapmakers of the 19th century. The Purcell family's Loughmoe Castle, near the village, retains a more accurate and older version of the name. The arms of the Baron of Loughmoe Certain localities in Ireland were given this name, probably because \\"in old times some tenant held them free of direct rent, as a reward for some signal service, or on condition of fulfilling some special duty\\".http://www.usa-purcell.com/loughmoe.html The Legend of Loughmoe Castle Local tradition has it that a king lived in the castle, and offered his daughter's hand to whoever could rid the land of a gigantic boar and sow that uprooted crops and killed anyone they met. A youth named Purcell killed the boar with a bow and arrow, and won the reward for himself and his descendants, and the area in which the Castle stands is known as \\"the field of the reward\\". The legend is alluded to in the Purcell family's coat of arms, which depicts the heads of four boars. Geography Loughmore is on the banks of the River Suir some 5.5 km south of Templemore, 10 km north of Thurles and a kilometre east of the main N62 road between those towns. Castleiney is some 5 km away and closer to Templemore. The parish is in the Golden Vale, one of the richest agricultural areas in Europe. Dairy farming and cattle raising are the principal occupations. Transport Loughmore lies on the Dublin - Cork railway line. The nearby Templemore railway station has direct trains to Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Tralee operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann. The N62 highway links Loughmore with the M8 motorway to Cork and the M7 to Dublin and Limerick. Loughmore's central location puts it within 90 minutes' drive of three international airports: Cork, Dublin and Shannon. History =Loughmore Castle= Loughmoe Castle was the seat of the Purcell family, who were Barons of Loughmoe. Construction of the castle began in 1328, the year that the family were granted the title of Barons of Loughmoe. Until the 1980s it was possible to climb the spiral stair in the right-hand tower. The monument is now in the care of the Office of Public Works. The title Baron of Loughmoe is an Irish feudal barony, and was possibly raised to a Jacobite peerage in 1690 while King James II of England was in exile. The feudal title was first granted to Richard Purcell in 1328 by James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond as palatine Lord of Tipperary. Irish and Scottish feudal titles, particularly those granted by palatine lords, are acknowledged as genuine hereditaments by the arms granting bodies of Ireland, Scotland, and England, but were never formally recognised by the British Crown. Referring to the Purcells of Loughmoe specifically, the medieval Irish genealogist Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh wrote that Purcell genealogy begins with Charlemagne, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. =The Cormack Brothers= In 1858 in Loughmore, two local men, Daniel and William Cormack, were executed for the murder of John Ellis, a land agent from Kilrush, near Templemore, County Tipperary. Ellis was hated for evicting tenants on behalf of the landlords who employed him. One night as he returned along the lane to his isolated home, his way was blocked by uprooted bushes and branches. He was shot by a hidden assailant and died an hour later. The police had no doubt that this was a political murder, because ¬£90 in Ellis‚Äôs wallet was left untouched. The brothers William and Daniel Cormack were arrested and convicted at Nenagh Assizes in March 1858, largely, it was felt at the time, on the evidence of an informer ‚Äì ‚Äúa villainous character‚Äù ‚Äì who was widely believed to have been part of the murder plot. The judge was the notoriously corrupt and harsh William Keogh. The common belief was that a local landlord had shot Ellis in a crime of passion involving Ellis' sister, and that the Cormack brothers had been framed for murder; 2,357 people signed a petition attesting to the brothers' innocence The brothers were hanged on Thursday, May 11, 1858 outside Nenagh Prison. Daniel Cormack addressed the crowd at the public execution from the scaffold, saying: ‚ÄúLord have mercy on me, for you know, Jesus, that I neither had hand, act, nor part in that for which I am about to die. Good people, pray for me.‚Äù According to a contemporary report, ‚Äúthe brother having made the same awful declaration, both were in the next moment launched into eternity‚Äù. Years later a tenant named Michael Gleeson, who had been evicted by Ellis, confessed to the murder.New York Times, May 12, 1910 In 1910 a committee was formed in Loughmore to exhume the brothers and rebury them in the churchyard. Daniel's and William's remains were ceremonially removed from Nenagh Gaol and brought back to Loughmore with two hearses drawn by plumed horses, followed by huge crowds. After the procession arrived in the village, the Cormack brothers were buried in a mausoleum in the churchyard where people still go to see the original oak coffins and the inscription proclaiming their innocence. On one side of the mausoleum is inscribed: Mausoleum in Loughmore Churchyard in memory of McCormack Brothers Inscribed on the other side: Sport Loughmore-Castleiney GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and has traditionally been a Gaelic football club but also has a hurling team. The parish is known as a ‚Äúfootball island‚Äù in mid-Tipperary as it is surrounded by clubs that play hurling only. In 2013, the parish won the Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship for the third time. Loughmore-Castleiney won the Munster Club Senior Hurling Championship in 2007. It has won the Tipperary Senior Football Championship 12 times, last winning it in 2013. Loughmore got the first double in the county by winning the senior hurling and football county finals in the same year. Loughmore is the home of a number of sportspeople, including the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship winning captain Liam McGrath (2011) and two time GAA GPA All Stars Awards winner Noel McGrath. The club provided Jim Ryan and Bill Ryan (Laha) to the Tipperary team that played in Croke Park on Bloody Sunday against Dublin in November, 1920 when their playing colleague Michael Hogan of Grangemockler was one of 15 people shot and killed by British forces who fired on the crowd and team.

It is also known as conversational hypnosis or sleight of mouth. It is a term largely used by proponents of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), a pseudoscientific approach to communication and interaction. The objective is to change the person's behavior subconsciously so that the target believes that they changed their mind of their own volition. When or if performed successfully, the target is unaware that they were hypnotized or that anything unusual has occurred. Arguably there is a debate about what hypnosis is, and how covert hypnosis should be classified. \\"Standard\\" hypnosis requires the focus and attention of the subject, while covert hypnosis seems to focus on \\"softening\\" the subject by using confusion, fatigue, directed attention, and interrupted sentences. This is most similar to salesmen talking to customers when they are tired. Critical thinking and questioning of statements likely requires mental effort.Burkley, E. (2008). The role of self-control in resistance to persuasion. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 419‚Äì431. The theme of \\"covert hypnosis\\" appears to be along the lines of causing the subject to enter \\"down time\\". Regardless of if \\"covert hypnosis\\" is \\"hypnosis\\" by a standard definition, fatigue does appear to make critically thinking more difficult. This might explain why interrogation, military training, and cult- recruitment practices prefer to deprive their new recruits of sleep.  Technique  Covert hypnosis is a phenomenon not too different from indirect hypnosis, as derived from Milton H. Erickson and popularized as \\"The Milton Model\\" in style, but the defining feature is that the hypnotized individual subsequently engages in hypnotic phenomena without conscious effort or choice. Covert hypnosis, like \\"Ericksonian Hypnosis\\", \\"operates through covert and subtle means... to reach deeper levels of consciousness than are touched by the surface structure of language\\". It is the concept that an individual, 'the hypnotist,' can control another individual's behavior via gaining rapport. During hypnosis, the operator or hypnotist makes suggestions. The subject is intended to not be completely aware, on a conscious level, of the suggestions. The hypnotist gains rapport with the listener(s) and the hypnotist maintains psychological congruency (the act of truly acting towards your goals without hesitation), both linguistically and in one's nonverbal communication. As the subject listens while feeling a psychological connection with the hypnotist and the hypnotist displaying behaviors such as confidence and understanding, the hypnotist then presents linguistic data in the form of metaphor: In other words, this process builds most likely unconscious states within the listener, and then associates those states through covert conditioning, also known as covert anchoring, thereby forming unconsciously controlled behaviors and thoughts. Often methods of tricking the listener to believe that the hypnotist is talking about something else other than the subject are employed, for instance, by shifting use of time and use of identity in language. One famous example is employed by Milton H. Erickson \\"and a tomato can be happy\\". =An example= A state of forgetfulness may be elicited by talking about what it feels like to be in that state in a manner that implies the other person is currently experiencing it. Once this state is at a heightened peak the hypnotist can then talk about that state, relating to a concept like the unsuspecting subject's name (a phenomenon called name amnesia), and the subject will suddenly be unaware of his/her name on questioning (provided the suggestions implied immediate effect and the reader is suggestible enough to be influenced in this way). The purpose of covert hypnosis is to shut down or at least reduce the analytical part of the subject's mind, least they suspect something. This may be achieved fairly quickly by someone with practice. In the media Real estate trainer Glenn Twiddle in June 2010, appeared on the Australian television show A Current Affair. The segment explains how he teaches real-estate agents these techniques to use on unsuspecting buyers of property.  In fiction  In fiction \\"covert hypnosis\\" has been featured in television series, though rather overrepresented. In The Mentalist, covert hypnosis is portrayed in an episode when a perpetrator uses it to control others and attempts to kill her employer.\\"Russet Potatoes\\", The Mentalist, Season 1. In an episode of The X-Files, a man with a brain tumor gains additional skill in hypnosis, and he utilizes it to escape police captivity.

Irani made news in 2007, when it was revealed that his total compensation for the 2006 year topped $450 million. His base salary was $1.3 million. Occidental justified the compensation by pointing to the stock price, which had risen from $9 a share when Irani succeeded Hammer to $48.60 at the end of 2006, and to the company's market capitalization, which grew from $32.1 billion at the end of 2005 to $42.5 billion at the end of 2006.

The Occidental Chairman opposed the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena of Deutsche Bank AG records as part of an investigation of myCFO Inc. His appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2006. Occidental's Board of Directors took no action against Irani despite the IRS ruling.

They also termed Irani's salary a \\"corporate giveaway program.\\" Irani's salary was considered excessive and not truly performance based for decades by a number of corporate governance authorities who noted that Irani's compensation had exceeded that of the head of energy giant ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, who led a company that has a market cap that was five times larger than Occidental Petroleum. In 2010, former CFO and later President Stephen Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani, who planned to stay on as executive Chairman until 2014. Irani was removed from the board of directors of Occidental on May 3, 2013. KB Home backdating scandal Irani was a KB Home director for 15 years until November 2007. Irani chaired the KB Home executive compensation committee during the time period when CEO Bruce Karatz lied about the company's practice of backdating options. Karatz was subsequently indicted and convicted April 21, 2010 on Federal charges stemming from his actions and sanctioned by the SEC in a separate civil action. The KB Home shareholders expressed their lack of confidence in the board and the compensation committee by a 19% opposition vote against Irani, who resigned from the KB Home board of directors after 15 years of service. Occidental offered no explanation for his resignation in their proxy statement. References External links *Biography from Businessweek.com. *House of Lebanon‚Äôs Ray R.

It consists of a benzyl group, C6H5CH2, attached to an amine functional group, NH2. This colorless water-soluble liquid is a common precursor in organic chemistry and used in the industrial production of many pharmaceuticals. The hydrochloride salt was used to treat motion sickness on the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission in which NASA astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. Manufacturing Benzylamine can be produced by several methods, the main industrial route being the reaction of benzyl chloride and ammonia. It is also produced by the reduction of benzonitrile and reductive amination of benzaldehyde, both done over Raney nickel. :400px It was first produced accidentally by Rudolf Leuckart in the reaction of benzaldehyde with formamide in a process now known as the Leuckart reaction, a general process in which reductive amination of aldehydes or ketones yields the corresponding amine. Biochemistry Benzylamine occurs biologically from the action of the N-substituted formamide deformylase enzyme, which is produced by Arthrobacter pascens bacteria. This hydrolase catalyses the conversion of N-benzylformamide into benzylamine with formate as a by-product. Benzylamine is degraded biologically by the action of the monoamine oxidase B enzyme, resulting in benzaldehyde. Uses Benzylamine is used as a masked source of ammonia, since after N-alkylation, the benzyl group can be removed by hydrogenolysis: (example of alklylation of benzylamine followed by hydrogenolysis). :C6H5CH2NH2 \\\\+ 2 RBr ‚Üí C6H5CH2NR2 \\\\+ 2 HBr :C6H5CH2NR2 \\\\+ H2 ‚Üí C6H5CH3 \\\\+ R2NH Typically a base is employed in the first step to absorb the HBr (or related acid for other kinds of alkylating agents). Benzylamine reacts with acetyl chloride to form N-benzylacetamide, an exemplar of the Schotten‚ÄìBaumann reaction first described in the 1880s. The reaction takes place in a two-phase solvent system (here water and diethyl ether) so that the hydrogen chloride by-product is sequestered in the aqueous phase (and sometimes neutralised with a dissolved base) and thus prevented from protonating the amine and impeding the progress of the reaction. These conditions are often called Schotten- Baumann reaction conditions and are applicable more generally. This particular example is useful as a model for the mechanism of interfacial polymerisation of a diamine with a diacid chloride. :500px Isoquinolines are a class of compounds (benzopyridines) which are used in medical contexts (such as the anesthetic dimethisoquin, the antihypertensive debrisoquine, and the vasodilator papaverine) and in other areas (such as disinfectant N-laurylisoquinolinium bromide). Isoquinoline itself is efficiently prepared using the Pomeranz‚ÄìFritsch reaction, but can also be prepared from benzylamine and glyoxal acetal by an analogous approach known as the Schlittler-M√ºller modification to the Pomeranz‚ÄìFritsch reaction. This modification can also be used for preparing substituted isoquinolines. Synthesis of HNIW from benzylamine The aza-Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction converts imines and dienes to tetrahydropyridines in which the nitrogen atom can be part of the diene or the dienophile. The imine is often generated in situ from an amine and formaldehyde. An example is the reaction of cyclopentadiene with benzylamine to form an aza-norbornene. :Image:Aza-Diels-Alder phenylmethylamine.png Benzylamine is used in the industrial manufacturer of numerous pharmaceuticals, including alniditan, lacosamide, moxifloxacin, and nebivolol.. It is also used to manufacture the military explosive hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW) which is superior to older nitroamine high explosives like HMX and RDX, though it is less stable. The US Navy is testing HNIW for use in rocket propellants, such as for missiles, as it has lower observability characteristics such as less visible smoke. HNIW is prepared by first condensing benzylamine with glyoxal in acetonitrile under acidic and dehydrating conditions. Four of the benzyl groups are removed from hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane by hydrogenolysis catalysed by palladium on carbon and the resulting secondary amine groups are acetylated in acetic anhydride. The resulting dibenzyl-substituted intermediate is then reacted with nitronium tetrafluoroborate and nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate in sulfolane to produce HNIW. Salts The hydrochloride salt of benzylamine, C6H5CH2NH3Cl or C6H5CH2NH2¬∑HCl, is prepared by reacting benzylamine with hydrochloric acid, and can be used in treating motion sickness. NASA astronaut John Glenn was issued with benzylamine hydrochloride for this purpose for the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission. The cation in this salt is called benzylammonium and is a moiety found in pharmaceuticals such as the anthelmintic agent bephenium hydroxynaphthoate, used in treating ascariasis. Other derivatives of benzylamine and its salts have been shown to have anti-emetic properties, including those with the N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)benzylamine moiety.. Commercially available motion-sickness agents including cinnarizine and meclizine are derivatives of benzylamine. Other benzylamines 1-Phenylethylamine is a methylated benzylamine derivative which is chiral; enantiopure forms are obtained by resolving racemates. Its racemic form is sometimes known as (¬±)-Œ±-methylbenzylamine. Both benzylamine and 1-phenylethylamine form stable ammonium salts and imines due to their relatively high basicity. Safety and environment Benzylamine exhibits modest oral toxicity in rats with LD50 of 1130 mg/kg. It is readily biodegraded.

Opera Pacific was an opera company located in the Orange County, California, United States city of Santa Ana. It operated for 22 seasons before closing in 2008 after several seasons of deepening financial difficulties. History The first season began in 1985 with David DiChiera as General Director (until 1996), though the company traces its roots to 1962 and the annual Festival of Opera Association in Laguna Beach, where productions were performed in late summer at the Irvine Bowl, in English. In order to promote expansion, the Opera League of Laguna Beach was established to \\"encourage, support and sustain interest in the Festival of Opera.\\" The first productions included such traditional repertory as Madame Butterfly, The Marriage of Figaro, and The Barber of Seville; I Pagliacci and The Devil and Daniel Webster were presented as a double billing during the 1965 season. In the early 1980s members of the Opera Leaque, along with other opera aficionados throughout Orange County, combined to form the core audience for the anticipated opening of the Orange County Performing Arts Center in neighboring Costa Mesa, at which time Opera Pacific was incorporated. Opera Pacific has been host to many of opera's greatest living legends, including the likes of Luciano Pavarotti in 1988, Dame Joan Sutherland in 1989, and in 1991 Pl√°cido Domingo (in concert with soprano Ana Panagulias). Diva Kathleen Battle also made an appearance in 2001. At its peak the company put on six productions each year, staging around six performances of each, but in its last years this fell to three staged operas in four performances each. Its financial artistic director was John DeMain. On November 4, 2008, Opera Pacific announced it will cancel the rest of its 2008/2009 season due to financial difficulties and will likely close down operations permanently.

DeTurck (born July 15, 1954) is an American mathematician known for his work in partial differential equations and Riemannian geometry, in particular contributions to the theory of the Ricci flow and the prescribed Ricci curvature problem. He first used the DeTurck trick to give an alternative proof of the short time existence of the Ricci flow, which has found other uses since then.  Education  DeTurck received a B.S. (1976) from Drexel University. He received an M.A. (1978) and Ph.D. (1980) in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania. His Ph.D. supervisor was Jerry Kazdan.  Career  DeTurck is currently Robert A. Fox Leadership Professor and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, where he has been the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences since 2005 and Faculty Director of Riepe College House. In 2002, DeTurck won the Haimo Award from the Mathematical Association of America for his teaching. Despite being recognized for excellence in teaching, he has been criticized for his belief that fractions are \\"as obsolete as Roman numerals\\" and suggesting that they not be taught to younger students. In January 2012, he shared the Chauvenet Prize with three mathematical collaborators.

The town was located near the small city of St. Marks, Florida.  History  Drawing of Magnolia, Florida (1842) =Establishment= In June 1827, only 6 years after Spain ceded Florida to the United States, four brothers from Maine, John, George, Nathaniel and Weld Hamlin founded the town of Magnolia on the St. Marks river just north of the existing town of St. Marks. The Ladd family also married into the Hamlin family and helped settle the new town of Magnolia. Their primary purpose was to establish a profitable shipping port for the export of cotton that would be delivered to the port from points north, primarily from the rail terminus in Tallahassee about 20 miles north. The Hamlins had relatives in Maine who owned and operated a large textile mill. =Growth and business= The town experienced initial growth as lots were platted and sold. Several stores, warehouses and a hotel that billed itself as the \\"best on the gulf\\" were established. Imports also came through the port to supply the growing Florida panhandle area. Such items of record include brown and loaf sugar, Canary, M√°laga and Bordeaux wine (known then as Claret wine), bleached osnaburg, powder, shot, lead, cordage, leans soup, foolscap sealing wax and Scotch snuff. Although a crude road made of dirt and wooden boards was constructed to run from this area to Tallahassee, a railroad was needed (In the early 1850s an upgraded plank road was constructed). By 1835 a rail connection was launched from Tallahassee to the town of St. Marks situated a little farther south on the St. Marks river. The rail effectively by-passed Magnolia. Although the rail line was crude and initially relied on mules to pull open cars along loosely anchored rails, this connection gave St. Marks a transportation advantage over Magnolia. By the late 1830s, the fate of Magnolia was sealed and most of the inhabitants picked up and moved either to St. Marks or to the new town of Port Leon south of St. Marks. Some of the buildings were moved along with the people. Port Leon later suffered a devastating hurricane that destroyed the town and caused its inhabitants to move back up closer to the original town of Magnolia and settle the town of Newport. In 1829 a US customs house was established at Magnolia. Magnolia, St. Marks, and sister river port town Port Leon, thrived from the commerce from Tallahassee merchants and cotton plantations of the Red Hills Region of north Florida and south Georgia when their products were hauled south to Tallahassee and beyond. These products were shipped to the port via wagon trains and the 24-mile-long Tallahassee Railroad. From that point, steamboats and sailing schooners then picked up these items at the port and transported them to other ports. As Magnolia waned and St. Marks thrived, the US Customs House was transferred to St. Marks in the 1830s. Maps show six named streets running northeast to southwest and five named streets running northwest to southeast with 34 blocks containing lots, homes, or businesses. On September 13, 1843, a dangerous hurricane hit the area with a 10-foot storm surge, severely damaging what was left of Magnolia as well as destroying nearby Port Leon and damaging St. Marks. There was another town named Magnolia that existed around the time of the American Civil War in Clay County, Florida, on the west bank of the St. Johns River. Period maps place this town just north of present-day Green Cove Springs, Florida. (Some maps (Atlas To Accompany The Official records of the Union and Confederate Armies) name the location as \\"Magnolia Hotel & Steam Mill,\\" but it appears in dispatches as Magnolia.) = Mayors, Councilmen, & Officials = [unknown] = U.S. Postmasters of Magnolia = 1831 - Edward Sexias (see Floridian, 24-Oct-1831, p2)  Photo gallery  File:Magnolia Florida Map rc04168.jpgOld map shows location of Magnolia File:Magnolia Florida map rc04167.jpgOld map with close view of Magnolia's streets File:Magnolia Florida Croquet Players no34362.jpgPeople enjoying croquet in an oak grove in Magnolia File:Magnolia Florida Steamboat Pier n034371.jpgThe steamer pier at Magnolia File:Magnolia Florida Cemetery 2008-07-31.jpgCemetery headstone worn by age Magnolia was large enough that the US Government permitted the Bank at Magnolia to issue its own Currency from 1832 through 1838.
