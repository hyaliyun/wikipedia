He released his debut album in 2000 and he achieved commercial success in 2007, after winning the Newcomers' Section of the Sanremo Music Festival with his entry \\"Pensa\\". The song became a number- one hit in Italy, while the album with the same title was certified gold by the Italian Music Industry Federation. As of 2020, he has released nine studio albums, an extended play and a live album. In 2011, Moro also presented the docu-reality Sbarre, broadcast by Rai 2. He also wrote songs for other artists, including pop rock band Stadio and pop singer Noemi. In a duet with Ermal Meta, he won the Sanremo Music Festival 2018 with the song \\"Non mi avete fatto niente\\", and represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal, reaching 5th place overall. Music career Fabrizio Moro released his debut single, \\"Per tutta un'altra destinazione\\", in 1996. The single was later included in his first self-titled studio album, which was released in 2000 by Ricordi, following his participation in the Newcomers' Section of the 50th Sanremo Music Festival. Moro competed with the song \\"Un giorno senza fine\\", placing 13th in a field of 18. In 2004 Moro recorded a Spanish-language version of the song \\"Situazioni della vita\\" for the compilation album Italianos para siempre, released in Latin America by Universal and featuring songs performed by several other Italian artists. His following singles, \\"Eppure pretendevi di essere chiamata amore\\" and \\"Ci vuole un business\\" were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, Moro rose to national fame after competing for a second time in the Newcomers' Section of the Sanremo Music Festival. His entry \\"Pensa\\", a rap-influenced anti-Mafia song dedicated to Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino won the Newcomers' competition and received the \\"Mia Martini\\" Critics' Award during the 57th edition of the contest. After being released as a single, \\"Pensa\\" topped the Italian Singles Chart and entered the top 40 in Switzerland. The song was also included in the album with the same title, which was later certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. Fabrizio Moro in concert, 20 July 2007 After his third participation in the Sanremo Music Festival, the first in the section reserved to established artists, Moro released his third studio album in 2008, titled Domani. The first single from the album, \\"Eppure mi hai cambiato la vita\\", placed third in the singing competition and became a top ten hit in Italy. In 2009 Moro contributed writing the song \\"Resta come sei\\" for the album Diluvio universale by Italian pop rock band Stadio. Moro also appears as a featured artists in the track. On 5 June 2009, he released his first Extended Play, Barabba. The title track was considered by Italian journalists as a reference to Silvio Berlusconi's scandal involving teenager Noemi Letizia. Despite this, he denied any reference to Silvio Berlusconi, claiming the song was written before the scandal was revealed. The following year, Moro competed once again in the Sanremo Music Festival, performing the song \\"Non √® una canzone\\". During the semi-final, he also performed the song with Spanish band Jarabe de Palo, but he failed to qualify for the final night of the competition. The song was included in the album Ancora Barabba and peaked at number 17 on the Italian FIMI Top Digital Download. In November 2011, Moro debuted as a TV personality, presenting the programme Sbarre, a docu-reality about Italian prisons broadcast by Rai 2. Moro also wrote and performed the programme's theme song, \\"Respiro\\", released as a single on 23 September 2011 and included in Moro's first live album, Live Atlantico. As a songwriter, Moro also wrote the songs \\"Sono solo parole\\" and \\"Se non √® amore\\", both released as singles by Noemi and included in the 2012 edition of RossoNoemi and in Rosso Live, respectively. On 11 February 2018, Moro, along with Ermal Meta, won the Big Artists section of the Sanremo Music Festival 2018 with the song Non mi avete fatto niente, and as such, represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal, reaching fifth place overall.

The Manor has been owned by various religious, national and farming owners over 600 years. The building has been added to and adapted over the centuries, but the basic structure is now clearly visible. The house is now owned by English Heritage and is open to the public on weekends in season. History Some form of occupation of the site has occurred since Roman times, a burial to the south-east of the present building is thought to date from then. The larger part of the parish of Strood was the rural area stretching south from the urbanised bridgehead along the River Medway. This area formed the Manor of Strood and lay within the Hundred of Shamel. Following The Anarchy of 1135 to 1153 the Crown was in debt to the Knights Templar and probably this was why the manor was given to them in 1159 by Henry II. The manor was in the Hundred of Shamel and the dues and administrative rights went with it. There were only six to fifteen actual Knights Templar in England, along with maybe 140 brethren who handled administration. Strood may not even have had a permanent brethren presence, possibly a lay-reeve or baliff would have run the estate. The Templars established a hall, barns and stables by 1185 but these were in timber and no trace remains above ground. The stone building visible today was originally built around 1240. It is not known precisely why Strood was rebuilt, perhaps to provide suitable lodging for dignitaries travelling along Watling Street between London and the continent via Dover. When the Knights Templar were suppressed in 1312 all their assets passed to the Knights Hospitaller, including Temple Manor. Around this time the building was extended to the north with a ground-floor hall roughly wide. Many of the scattered farm buildings were cleared between 1308‚Äì1344 and evidence from archaeology indicates relatively little disturbance during the suppression of the Templars. It is thought therefore that the manor had already become simply a farm to generate rent money for its owner. It is possible that the tenants were the Creyes, known to be the wealthiest family in Strood but who held not feudal lands. An inventory of Templar estates in 1313 lists a hall, a chamber, a chapel and a barn as being at Strood. Some years after the suppression of the Templars, the Grand Prior of the Hospitallers complained that the king was still occupying ex-Templar lands at Denny, Cambridgeshire and Strood. The complaint was to no avail and in 1324 the lands were ceded to the King. In 1342 Edward III granted it to Mary of St Pol, Countess of Pembroke who in turn granted it to her nunnery at Denny Cambridgeshire. Given the lack of transport at the time, it could not have been used to supply the nunnery with goods, and so must have simply been a source of revenue. The following century a new wing was added to the north of the building at its western end, where the entrances are. This wing was (E-W) by (N-S) with a parlour below and chambers above. The ground-floor hall was reduced in status to a kitchen and further additions (in timber) were made to the north. View of Temple Manor from Rochester, 1767 (from Hasted's History of Kent) At the dissolution of the monasteries the Abbey of Denny was dissolved and both it and Temple Manor granted to Edward Elrington in 1539. He sold Temple Manor to the local Cobham family. Following a conviction for conspiracy against James VI and I 1603 Lord Cobham's property was seized by Robert Cecil. Using a London lawyer called Hyde, Cecil sold it on to Ludovic Stewart the future Duke of Richmond. Richmond in his turn sold it to Isaac Blake. The Blake family were possibly the richest family in Strood at the time. The Blakes may have been sitting tenants for some years, Isaac was a Churchwarden and a dealer in iron-ware and possibly scrap. The Blakes were responsible for the brick extensions and continued to hold it until the 18th century. A succession of owners followed and as the fortunes of the estate declined parts were sold off until the residue was sold to the City of Rochester in the 1930s. At this stage it was well cared for and surrounded by a fine garden. Locally there was a debate over its future, the council planned to use the surrounding site for industrial development. Having no obvious use for the house, a committee was formed to preserve it. The Second World War interrupted plans, and by in 1947 the site was recognised and scheduled. However neglect and vandalism had taken their toll; the barn had fallen down and the roof collapsed. In 1950 the building was listed as grade I and any plans for its demolition were thwarted. During the early 1950s the Ministry of Works oversaw work to preserve and restore the building as it can be seen today. Description View from the north-west showing the brick extension and turret The main section of the building has a stone-built vaulted undercroft which supports the single large room above. This style of building is known as a first-floor hall. The upper room (reached by an external stair) was the higher status area, providing accommodation for travelling knights and officials. This original section is by , and the undercroft walls are thick. Construction is of flint and ragstone rubble with ashlar dressings. The doorway to the upper chamber is ornate with Purbeck marble shafts to either side and mouldings above. There was originally a drawbar running into holes. Originally the walls would have been plastered smooth and painted like stone. The original division of the hall was into a high status decorated room to the west and a simpler room to the east. The fireplaces and stack which dominate the room are from the 17th-century modifications by the Blakes. The entrance door led directly into the western room which would have been used for communal activities and for eating. The better lit eastern end was probably a chamber, similar to those provided at episcopal and royal palaces for visiting guests. Heating would have been by brazier, there is plenty of height and no evidence of medieval filerplaces. There is continuous wall seating from which pilars of purbeck marble rose to carry an arcade. This arcade has been mutilated and partially restored. Such plaster as remains carries later graffiti including a name, possibly Cray. The chamber at the eastern end has two splayed recesses, tentatively identified as a wash baison and a privy within a screened off garderobe. Scattered floor tiles have been found and it is probable that the upper floor was tiled prior to the departure of the Templars. At the western end there appears to have been a form of serving hatch from a now lost and unrecorded western extension. A later oven or still is of unknown purpose. The undercroft has three bays of quadrapartite ribbed vaults. The ribs are of simple decoration with excellent dressed infill. Illumination is from wide windows, externally lancet and internally square headed with the original oak lintels still in place. Originally the windows were fitted with iron bars, possibly for security to what was originally, and remained, a cellar. The western extension is of three floors entered by a separate ground floor door. The stair is housed in a turret and gives access to three floors with a single room on each floor. There is no communication between the extension and the original structure. The brickwork is in English bond with moulded string courses. The eastern extension had a small store below supporting a wooden framed gazebo above. The gazebo forms an extension to the original hall and when built would have commanded extensive views over the River Medway. The original situation is best appreciated from the 1767 engraving in Hasted (above). Mature trees and a railway embankment block any such view today. The roof was replaced in the 1950s restoration after much of the original collapsed from the neglect the building suffered during the war.

Allen Clarke, was an English working-class humorist, novelist, journalist and social investigator from Lancashire. An ILP member and friend of Robert Blatchford, Clarke succeeded Joseph Burgess as editor of the Yorkshire Factory Times. Life Born in Bolton, Clarke left school at thirteen, when he moved with his parents to Mirfield and worked half-time in a mill. The family soon moved back to Bolton, where he continued to work, while studying in his spare time at Hulton School. He became a pupil-teacher there, and he continued to teach for seven years, after which he took a post with the Bolton Evening News. Initially, his work was mundane, copying records and compiling directories, but the local engineers' strike of 1887 inspired him to become more political, and he joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) the following year, when Tom Mann founded a local branch.Margaret 'Esipinasse, Dictionary of Labour Biography (vol.5), pp.64‚Äì70 Clarke founded his own newspaper in 1890, the Labour Light, on which he employed James Haslam in his first journalistic role. The two also worked with J. R. Clynes in an attempt to found a trade union for cotton piecers in Lancashire. Both projects were unsuccessful, but Clarke founded a new paper in 1891, the Bolton Trotter, which ran as a weekly publication until 1893, together with an annual, the Trotter Christmas Annual. Teddy Ashton's Journal was started in 1896 as a continuation of the Trotter, with Teddy Ashton's Christmas Annual as the associated annual. Clarke continued to edit the publication (as Teddy Ashton's Northern Weekly, Teddy Ashton's Weekly Fellowship and Teddy Ashton's Weekly) for fourteen years.'The Bolton Trotter', The Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals, 1800‚Äì1900 Clarke's best-known novel, The Knobstick (1893), was originally serialised in the Yorkshire Factory Times. It took the 1887 Bolton Engineers' Strike as its backdrop, though Clarke added both a love story and a sensational crime plot. Clarke moved towards spiritualism in the 1890s, affected by some family tragedies and apparently encountering the psychic powers of his second wife. Clarke stood as the Labour Representation Committee candidate for Rochdale at the 1900 UK general election, supported by both the SDF and the Independent Labour Party (ILP), of which he was now also a member. He opposed the Second Boer War, and called for state pensions and the nationalisation of the railways and coal mines. He took 901 votes and third place. In the same year, he moved back to Bolton to become editor of the Northern Weekly, then back to Blackpool in 1906, where he continued to edit the Weekly and Teddy Ashton's Journal. He also wrote for the Liverpool Weekly Post and Blackpool Gazette, and produced a series of novels. Clarke trained his younger brother, Tom Clarke, as a journalist, and Tom later became editor of the Daily News and News Chronicle.

It was during that period that he began his operatic career on local radio broadcasts (RAI). He soon was invited to sing at most of the opera houses and concert halls throughout Italy. His career of some thirty years would also take him to many European countries, to North and South America, as well as to South Africa and Australia. His repertoire was vast, ranging from Caldara and Paisiello Romains on the Leningrad stage / Soviet Music nr 7, 1966, pp.61-83Photoalbum to Pizzetti and Alfano, and also including Mussorgsky, Mascagni, Max von Schillings, and Renato Chiesa,http://www.dizionariobiograficodeifriulani.it/clabassi-plinio/ but he was mostly admired for the 19th-century romantic works by composers such as Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, and Puccini. A basso cantante with a beautiful even voice, he was admired for his scenic intelligence and dignity. He can be heard on several studio and live recordings. Clabassi was married to opera singer Rina Gigli (the daughter of Beniamino Gigli), with whom he appeared on a number of occasions, including a 1966 production of Turandot at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.Forbes, Elizabeth (4 September 2000). \\"Obituary: Rina Gigli\\".

Career According to Edwards, Neville may have served in the household of Cardinal Wolsey in his youth. From 1524 on he was from time to time a commissioner of the peace for Worcestershire. He held lands in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, some of which had been bequeathed to him and to his wife by her father, Sir Giles Greville. During the late 1520s and 1530s these were the subject of litigation.. In December 1532 Thomas Wood accused Neville of treason, alleging he had prophesied the King's death, and that he himself would become Earl of Warwick. In addition there were other allegations that Neville had dabbled in magic, including the claim that at one time 'he tried to make himself a cloak of invisibility of two layers of linen with one between of buckskin, the whole to be treated with a mixture in which horse bones, skin, chalk, rosin and powdered glass were the chief ingredients.'. His former chaplain, Edward Legh, made similar allegations in March 1533. It appears Neville, and his brothers George and Christopher, who were also drawn into the investigation, escaped from these charges relatively unscathed.. In 1534 Neville petitioned Thomas Cromwell, claiming that owing to great losses he was so impoverished that he could not afford to go to law to obtain redress of wrongs done to him. Neville wrote The Castell of Pleasure, an allegorical work in which a dreamer, Desire, is led by Morpheus to a castle where he encounters Beauty and other allegorical personages. On waking the dreamer laments the changeableness of human affairs. The poem is prefaced and followed by verses by Robert Copland. The Castell of Pleasure is said to have been influenced by the poems of Stephen Hawes. It was published by Henry Pepwell in 1518, and by Wynkyn de Worde in about 1530.

Biography Born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Mills received his earliest instruction from his father, who was organist at Gloucester Cathedral. The father was a great admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, hence the name he gave his firstborn son. In adulthood, Mills simply signed himself \\"S.B. Mills.\\" In spite of the name and his father's vocation, Mills chose piano over the organ. His precocious talent brought him to the attention of the French light music composer Louis-Antoine Jullien, who engaged the \\"infant prodigy\\" for his earliest concert performances. Young Mills played at Drury Lane Theatre in London in 1846 at the age of six, performing Czerny‚Äôs Rondo Brillant on Themes from PreciosaBomberger, E. Douglas (ed.): Brainard's Biographies of American Musicians (Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1999), pp. 187‚Äì188; . and gave a command performance before Queen Victoria at age seven.

At Leipzig, he met his future wife, Antonia Young, a native of Germany whose family had emigrated to Chicago. He went to America in 1856 and, after some disappointing initial receptions, was engaged by New York Philharmonic Society music director Carl Bergmann to perform the Schumann Piano Concerto in A minor. Its favorable reception before a largely German- speaking crowd let Bergmann to re-engage Mills for other performances, and the pianist appeared annually with the Philharmonic Society from 1859 to 1877. He also made tours of Germany in 1859, 1867 and 1878. A personal friend of William Steinway, he performed exclusively on Steinway pianos.Saffle, Michael and Heintze, James R.

NaaS sometimes includes the provision of a virtual network service by the owners of the network infrastructure to a third party. Often this includes network virtualization using a protocol such as OpenFlow. Some service models are: * Virtual private network (VPN): Extends a private network and the resources contained in the network across networks like the public Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were a private network with the functionality and policies of the private network. * Bandwidth on demand (BoD): Technique by which network capacity is assigned based on requirements between different nodes or users. Under this model, link rates can be dynamically adapted to the traffic demands of the nodes connected to the link. * Mobile network virtualization: Model in which a telecommunications manufacturer or independent network operator builds and operates a network (wireless, or transport connectivity) and sells its communication access capabilities to third parties (commonly mobile phone operators) charging by capacity utilization. A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), is a mobile communications services provider that does not own the radio spectrum or wireless network infrastructure over which it provides services.

The half lathe of Milton consisted only of the hundred of Milton, including most of Sheppey. The lathe of Wye consisted of the remainder of the later lathe of Scray, except for the hundreds of Blackbourne, Rolvenden and Selbrittenden (Silverden), then being in Limen (Lympne) (later renamed Shepway) lathe. By 1295 the lathe of Scray was in existence, based on a merger of Milton and Wye. In the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries the hundreds of Barkley, Cranbrook, East Barnfield, Marden, and Tenterden were established within the lathe of Scray.The Hidation of Kent by J. E. A.

Almost all of Sheppey is within the hundred of Milton, except the conjoined island of Harty, which is within the hundred of Faversham. That part of the hundred of Milton in the island of Sheppey, was within the jurisdiction of one constable, appointed for it at the court-leet held for the manor and hundred of Milton, and this part of the hundred of Milton was styled the Liberty of Sheppey.See The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: section on Island of Sheppey, author:Edward Hasted, publ. 1797 See map. The Lathe was an important administrative, judicial and taxation unit for 600 years after the Domesday Book. The functions of Lathe and hundreds were somewhat similar, with a Lathe covering a much wider area. Although not abolished, it has no administrative functions today.History of Kent, by Frank Jessup, 1958 The Sheriff toured the county twice yearly attending on the lathes. The lathe was responsible for raising of aids and subsidies for the Militia. However the Lathe court became anomalous as it fell between the hundredal courts below and the Justices of the County (in petty and quarter sessions) above Dartford Country - The Story Of The Hundred Of Axstane by G. Porteus(page 32) The Lathe and division of the Lathe were the basis for meetings of local justices of the peace in monthly or petty sessions. These were established on a regular footing at a particularly early date in Kent. Lambarde in his Perambulation of Kent (1576) gives the Distribution of the Shyre for Execution of Justice. Scray was divided into an Upper and Lower Division, while a group of hundreds in the middle of the Lathe of Scray, centred on Ashford, were for convenience attached to the Lathe of Shepway for petty sessional purposes.See \\"A topographie or survey of the county of Kent\\", by Richard Kilburne, London, 1659 From time to time existing divisions were split for sake of convenience and in 1857 the provisions of the Act of 9 Geo. IV were invoked to re-examine the whole structure The National Archives, Kew, Richmond, Surrey, TW9 4DU, http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk (see section of Petty Sessions) The Lower Division of Scray, which formed the southernmost part of the Lathe, consisted of the following Hundreds: * Barkley * Blackbourne * Cranbrook * East Barnfield * Marden * Rolvenden * Selbrittenden * Tenterden The remainder of the Lathe formed the Upper Division. The Quarter Sessions of the county were held at both Canterbury, for East Kent and at Maidstone for West Kent. The Lower Division of Scray belonged to West Kent and the Upper Division to East Kent. Scray was the only Lathe that was divided between the two major divisions of the county.See \\"Journey Book of England, Kent\\", publ.

It is located in Dundonald parish on the A759 at the junction with the B746 and a minor road to Dundonald.  Etymology  Recorded as Loans, Lones, or Lons, the name of the village may have no connection with lending and be derived from the green loans or loaning (a piece of soft, rough ground) around the Bushie and Craiksland Burns, which joined each other at the foot the old orchard at Crossburn. A 'loan' can simply refer to a 'lane' and as such is a common placename element, which would be particularly appropriate to Loans, which is at a crossroads.Scots Dictionary Retrieved : 2012-12-16 Before the encloser of fields, a loan or strip of grass was left that ran through the arable part of a farm or farms, linking it with the common grazing ground of a clachan, serving both as a pasture and a driving road. A lon can mean a loan of land granted by the king, from which an income is derived to benefit an establishment or simply the Land of King Robert.Gillespie, Page 260 History The old school. During feudal times, Robertloan House and Hillhouse were the seats of the local lairds. Fairs were held here in June and October of each year. In 1806 five small steadings comprised the settlement of Loans.Loans Local History The A78 formerly ran through the settlement when it followed the course of the Irvine to Ayr turnpike.Love (2003), Page 226 After the death of Colonel William Fullarton in 1808, the Fourth Duke of Portland purchased the Lands of Fullarton that included Loans, the Lady Isle and Crosbie. A school had been established at the Darley prior to 1840, however it had closed by 1866. In 1877 a school was built in the village itself. Teachers included Miss Jessie A. Meikle, Miss Shaw, Miss Baird, and Miss Martha Meikle.History of LoansGillespie, Page 517 Some of the old houses in Loans were little better than smuggling vaults, having double walls and many cargoes from the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland ended up hidden in the village. All around Loans, especially in sand hills, were 'brandy holes', being large pits the size of rooms used for storing brandy casks.Gillespie, Pages 565-566 The village smithy was once situated on the main street, as was the post office. The name Corseburn is first recorded at the time of the Highway Act of 1835. Crossburn Bridge was situated in the formation of the highway, constructed over what had previously been a ford of the Craiksland or Sculloch Burn crossed the highway as a ford until the Corseburn or Crossburn Bridge was built. The Loans toll, at the foot of Crossburn Avenue came into use during the early years of the 18th century. There were two toll bars, both made of pine. These gates were leased out together or as separate entities. The village tolls added to their income by selling whisky and ale.

Robertloan House in the centre of the village was the home of William Dickie, last of the lairds who sold the estate to the Duke of Portland in 1861. Later associated with the Guthrie family, Robertloan was the headquarters of the Kilmarnock Dairy Institute in 1906. Leprosy The old smithy. In the 14th century Robert the Bruce is thought to have suffered from leprosy, psoriasis or some other skin ailment and is reputed to have drunk from a brook at Prestwick's \\"Bruce's Well\\". The apparent healing effects of the waters caused him to establish a lazar house, or hospital for lepers. The king endowed the establishment with the income from the lands of Loans, ensuring its survival. The villagers of Loans were required to support eight lepers, each of whom was to have, annually, \\"eight bolls of meal and eight merks\\". The meal for the lepers was ground at the nearby Sculloch Mill. When the leper hospital closed and in the 1730s the endowment was taken over by the Wallaces of Craigie, who continued to meet the obligation, but it was later purchased by a writer from Edinburgh at a judicial sale, selling it on to the magistrates of Ayr for ¬£300, who used it to provide for the inmates of the Ayr poorhouse. As late as 1882 three farmers in the Robertloan accepted responsibility for this ancient tax, and refunded the full assessment of meal and merks to their own tenants and employees. The endowment continued to be paid to the poor of Ayr and Prestwick until 1924, although leprosy had long ceased to exist in Scotland. The village was home to a renowned Turkish barber, known locally as Big Boko Haram, who specialised in tramlines, stars and more traditional buzz cuts. A wheen of amateur football stars have cut there teeth on the playing fields of loans and moved on to bigger clubs such as moss blown and Polnessan. The locals also claim Rabbie burns ‚Äúshagged‚Äù his first bit of skirt in the basement of the old loans inn.

Founded under the patronage of Clemens Mary Hofbauer and has been staffed by clergy of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (the Redemptorists) since its founding in 1917.  History  In 1916, the parish of St. Peter's, which had been established in 1834 to serve the whole of Saratoga Springs, was split along Broadway. The new parish of St. Clement's was formally opened the following year, when the first Catholic Mass in the parish church was celebrated on opening day, October 14, 1917. Bishop Edmund Gibbons dedicated the church, and thus the parish, to Clement Maria Hofbauer on November 25, 1918. Masses were originally held in the basement of nearby St. Clements School. The parish serves Catholics on the East Side of the City of Saratoga Springs, as well as in the neighboring Town of Wilton. St. Clement's created the mission church of St. Therese in Gansevoort out of the local Grange hall in 1965; the first Mass was celebrated there on September 18, 1966. After fifty years at its original location, a new building was constructed at its current location and opened in 1967, the 50th anniversary of the parish's foundation.  School  The Catholic school is first mentioned in parish records in August 1918. The school operated the School Sisters of Notre Dame, who lived in nearby buildings until a convent was constructed in 1931. St. Clement's Regional Catholic School continues to serve Pre-Kindergarten through fifth grade. The current principal is Jane Kromm.

The school was founded in 2009 by Dr. Tim Morthland and opened in 2011 as a small, co-educational liberal arts college. The college had an initial enrollment of forty students and 300-400 students prior to its closure in 2018. Morthland College athletic teams were known as the Patriots. The college was a member of the NCCAA in the Division-I Mid-East Region. In January 2017, the United States Department of Education and state investigators began investigating the college for financial irregularities. As a result, the college closed in 2018. History Morthland College was founded by Dr. Tim Morthland in 2009. Dr. Morthland pioneered the institution of a Christian college in the region, founded on the principles of scholarship and Christianity. He began gathering support for the school and on March 29, 2009, seventy community members met in West Frankfort to discuss the subject of building a Christian college in Southern Illinois. In October 2009, the institution was incorporated as a non-profit organization and it was certified by the IRS in March 2010 with 501C3 status. Dr. Morthland and the board of trustees appointed 32 faculty members who embrace the \\"Christian\\" values of the college. On October 5, 2010, Morthland College when the college was given approval by the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) to operate. As part of the IBHE approval process, the college received a thorough review that included: site visits and meetings, and analysis of the course catalog and offerings. The college began recruiting its first students to begin the following fall semester. Morthland set an enrollment cap of 100 students for the first year but a five-year goal of 500 students. The college opened offices in downtown West Frankfort, planned to hold classes at the community high school, library and park district buildings. Morthland College initial programs of study included the BA in Biblical Studies and the BA in Classics. Morthland held opening ceremonies on August 15, 2011. The ceremony marked the official opening of the college and included speeches and prayers from Dr. Morthland, faculty, and guest speakers. Classes began the next day on August 16, 2011 with 11 full and part-time students enrolled in two degrees programs, a Bachelor of Arts in Classics or a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies. The college utilized two classrooms and a computer lab in its administration building on Main Street in West Frankfort. In October 2011, the college received approval from the IBHE to offer a BA in Business Administration to begin in the 2012-13 academic year. In early 2012, Morthland announced further expansion, adding an athletic department with five initial sports. In the summer to 2012, the college continued expansion efforts and purchased the historic former Elks building located at Oak and Emma Streets in West Frankfort. The four-story, building was built in 1923; it houses administrative offices, faculty offices, chapel, student commons, and a kitchen and student area. The college's enrollment increased to over forty students in the fall semester, up from the original 11 in the first year of the college. In April 2013, Morthland College was awarded Candidate status by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS). TRACS is recognized by the United States Department of Education (USDE), the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE). One year later, in April 2014, Morthland College was awarded full accreditation by TRACS. By 2017, financial issues began to affect the college and evidence of financial mismanagement became publicly known. Glenn Poshard, the college's second President, suddenly resigned and was replaced by Dr. Morthland. In resigning he made a reference to the problems at the college: \\"I believe strongly in the vision and the mission of Morthland College and the opportunity it provides in offering students a faith-based, Christian education, however there are serious issues ‚Äî both personnel and financial ‚Äî of which I was not notified when I began as president, and which, I concluded, could only be resolved by an authority other than myself.‚Äù Subsequently, financial documents were leaked which indicated a possible financial crisis at the college, including over $700,000 in unpaid taxes and $80,000 owed to a contractor. In September it was reported that Morthland College was being investigated by state, federal agencies and that the college had been fined $2,000,000 by the Department of Education for an alleged \\"breach of fiduciary duty.\\" The Department of Education had also revoked the school's ability to access federal student aid funds. The same report also indicated that the Illinois Board of Higher Education was conducting an official investigation into the financial irregularities, and that the IBHE has received communication from Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, Morthland‚Äôs accreditor, indicating that it, too, would be conducting its own review, investigating ‚Äúpossible issues of non-compliance with TRACS accreditation standards.‚Äù The letter from IBHE states that according to the Illinois Amended Code 1030, notification of investigation is the first step in what could lead to the revocation of a college‚Äôs certificate of approval to operate. Academics Morthland College offered the Bachelor of Arts degree. Most courses were offered in the traditional classroom-based learning; however, Morthland College does offer several classes online. Morthland College was approved to operate with the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) in 2011 and received full accreditation by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) in April 2014. TRACS is recognized by the United States Department of Education (USDE), the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE). In the fall of 2013, Morthland College was approved by the United States Department of Education to disburse Pell Grants, Direct, and Indirect Student Loans. The college also disbursed the GI Bill through the state of Illinois. The college expanded its facilities to include Washington Hall, Coleman-Rhoads Hall, and Whitfield Hall in its first four years of operation. In 2015 a private investor, Brad McMillin Inc., constructed Mount Vernon House student dorm that can house 98 students. Of the 14 college graduates this year ‚Äî one of whom actually graduated in December but is coming back to walk in the ceremony ‚Äî three are classics majors and the remaining 11 have earned business administration degrees of which 2 where online. In 2012 the college officially launched their online programs. Two of the students have attended Morthland College since that first year, while the rest transferred in, some thanks to an articulation agreement with MidContinent University when it shut down last year.http://www.bentoneveningnews.com/article/20150506/news/701242495/  Athletics  The Morthland College Athletic Department was launched in fall 2012 with the Patriot as its official mascot. The Morthland College Patriots compete in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) in the Mid-East Region. As of Fall 2013, the athletic department included Men's Basketball, Baseball, Football, and Wrestling. Women's sports include Softball, Volleyball, and Basketball. In 2015, the men's basketball team won the Christian College National Invitational Tournament (CCNIT) under the leadership of Coach Rich Herrin. On May 17, 2017, school trustees voted to shutter the athletic program in its entirety.

He is principally known as a songwriter and musician and for co-writing and recording Karma Chameleon one of the biggest hits of the 1980s era with Boy George and Culture Club during his tenure as keyboard player and backing vocalist for the group on every live performance throughout the world during the 1980s. Prior to this, Pickett co-founded hit-making pop band Sailor in 1973 which achieved considerable chart-topping success in the mid-1970s Glamrock period and with whom he still regularly performs to the present day. Pickett's songs have also been recorded by many other artists including Labi Siffre, Sheena Easton, Georgie Fame, Joe Cocker, Brian Kennedy and Malcolm McLaren, used in countless TV commercials and included in the soundtrack of Hollywood films Electric Dreams, Top Secret!, The Lost Boys and his West End Musical Theatre debut, Casper The Musical.\\"Casper The Friendly Ghost\\", Shaftesbury Theatre 1999 Early years Pickett was born on 19 November 1946 in M√ºnster, Germany (B.A.O.R.) the only child of father Philip George Pickett, an RAF pilot officer killed in a flying accident in Rhodesia in 1950 and mother Eileen Elizabeth Pickett who died in Spain in 1993. Upon leaving school at Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham England in 1964, Phil took the advice of a family mentor, Philip Sutton, a director of Garfield Weston's Associated British Foods, by choosing to take an apprenticeship in the bakery industry, but by this time was also immersing himself in a growing passion and talent for musical composition. An interest in American music, particularly R&B;, led him to form his first band, \\"The Blues Unit\\" with some school and college friends. After completing his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, whilst taking a 12-month sabbatical travelling across the USA, Pickett enjoyed a brief but life-changing chance encounter with legendary jazz musician Duke Ellington in a North Beach supper club in San Francisco, who whilst raising a glass to the young man, strongly advised him to \\"follow his heart\\" and return to England to pursue a music career instead. Music career 1969‚Äì1973 Upon hearing an early arrangement of an obscure Peter Paul and Mary album track, the then relatively unknown \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" that Pickett had curated and was now performing with his folk singing partner Paddy Maguire at \\"Mother's\\" in Erdington 1968, Warner Bros executives Ian Ralfini and Martin Wyatt arriving from London to audition the duo and realising the track was already published by Warners, released it a few weeks later and the song went straight to Number One in the UK chart staying there for several weeks. Moving to London in 1969, Phil was employed as an arranger by E. H. Morris, a US music publisher based in Hanover Square W1 with the added responsibility of sifting through the many tapes sent in by hopeful writers. One of the songwriters was Norwegian guitarist / vocalist, Georg Kajanus, who after being recommended to the publisher, Phil contacted with a view to forming a group. The duo, now called \\"Kajanus Pickett\\" recorded an album of self-composed material, \\"Hi-Ho Silver\\" for Arty Mogul's Signpost label, an imprint of Atlantic Records. Around this period Pickett also worked with Vanda and Young, playing on many of their early tracks and also wrote a number of songs with Scott English and B.A. Robertson, all of them E.H. Morris songwriters in the late 1960s/early '70s. One of his songs, \\"Lay Me Down\\" was recorded by Georgie Fame ‚Äì Pickett's first significant 'cover' recording. Sailor 1973‚Äì Although the \\"Kajanus Pickett\\" L.P. achieved fairly limited success upon release, in 1973 Pickett co-founded pop band Sailor with Kajanus with the addition of keyboard player, Henry Marsh, and drummer, Grant Serpell. Sailor recorded a total of 10 albums throughout their career achieving considerable UK and international success during the early to mid-1970s with a number of hit singles produced by Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes, most notably 'A Glass of Champagne'\\"A Glass of Champagne\\" and 'Girls Girls Girls'\\"Girls Girls Girls\\" ‚Äì the former hit dislodging Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody at the UK Number 1 spot in the NME chart in 1976 after having resided at the Number 2 slot for several weeks. (Thirty years on, in 2006, 'Champagne' was again heavily featured, this time in a TV advertising campaign for Marks and Spencer accompanied by some of the world's top supermodels and widely attributed as a major contributory factor in the High Street retailer's successful renaissance and rebranding exercise.) The band topped the charts all over Europe in the 1970s earning many gold albums and sell-out tours with a reputation for extravagantly unique and theatrical productions. The group also frequently appeared on the BBC's iconic \\"Top of the Pops\\" TV show and Mike Mansfield's \\"Supersonic\\" on LWT together with their many overseas equivalents. Kajanus eventually left the group in 1978 with Pickett taking up the reins of Sailor by recording \\"Dressed For Drowning \\" (Epic/ Caribou) an album predominantly written by him and produced by US record producer James William Guercio at his famous Caribou Ranch Studios in Colorado in 1979. This incarnation featured Phil's bandmate Henry Marsh and newcomers, brother and sister duo, Virginia (Ginny) and Gavin David, Serpell having left to become a teacher. In a Playboy interview at the time, the Beach Boys' (late) Carl Wilson, who later sang with Pickett on one of the Caribou recordings ('Whatever's in Your Heart') named \\"Dressed For Drowning\\" his favourite album of that year (1980). Another of his songs, 'Don't Send Flowers' was covered by Sheena Easton as the opening track of her debut triple-platinum album Take My Time considerably adding to Pickett's growing reputation as a pop songwriter in that year. In 1993, Pickett whilst attending meetings in Germany, was approached by pop impresario/ promoter, Rainer Haas with a view to reform the original line-up of Sailor; Georg Kajanus, Grant Serpell, Henry Marsh and himself to perform a series of concert tours throughout Germany and Austria. Upon agreement to the generous terms negotiated by Pickett, the band were immediately signed up by Haas to play 100 concerts during 1993‚Äì94 and performed their music to bigger audiences than in their entire hit-making career throughout the early to mid-1970s. Sailor were unique amongst their erstwhile contemporaries for (a) being a 100% original line-up and, (b) for recording two new contemporary hits in Benelux and Germany in the 1990s ‚Äì \\"The Secretary\\" and \\"La Cumbia\\" (These tracks were recorded on an earlier recording project for BMG on two albums, \\"Sailor\\" and \\"Streetlamp\\" for which Kajanus composed all the material, as in earlier years a pre-condition of his involvement in recording). Sailor's music catalogue is still controlled by the band's first manager, Steve Morris, son of the late E.H. (Buddy) Morris to the present day through his company Sashay Music. In 1995 Kajanus retired from live performance, his place being taken up by lead guitarist/vocalist Peter Lincoln. Grant Serpell retired in 2011 and was replaced by Henry Marsh's son Thomas Marsh. Peter Lincoln left to join The Sweet in 2006 and was replaced by Oliver Marsh, Henry's younger son on lead vocals and guitar. Sailor still perform fairly regularly, mainly in Germany, Benelux and Scandinavia with Pickett having so far played on every live performance with the band since 1973 to the present day. \\"A Glass of Champagne ‚Äì The Official Sailor Story\\" by James McCarraher, Sarum Press Culture Club / Boy George 1982‚Äì86 On returning to England from the US in 1982 Pickett, by now in demand as a session player and arranger, joined Boy George's band, Culture Club on keyboards and backing vocals initially co-writing It's A Miracle and Karma Chameleon. The latter song, according to Sir Richard Branson ( in Losing My Virginity) to whom his label Culture Club were signedVirgin Records \\"Became Number 1 in every country in the world that had a chart, selling 1.4 million records in the UK alone.\\" This earned Phil two Ivor Novello Awards, possibly the music industry's most prestigious songwriting award in 1983 ‚Äì for \\"Best Pop Song\\" and \\"Highest-Selling A-side\\". Pickett played extensively on all of the band's records throughout this period and also co-wrote many other songs with the band including Move Away produced by Arif Mardin which in 1986 climbed to Number 7 in the US Billboard Chart before the lead singer's drugs conviction in the UK which eclipsed the band's career and prospects for several years afterwards. However Phil composed a number of other songs with Boy George prior to this period including the title track of the movie Electric Dreams sung by P.P. Arnold and \\"How Silly Can You Get\\" sung by Val Kilmer debuting in the Zucker Brothers' Top Secret! Karma Chameleon is currently heavily featured in Boy George's new production of the Taboo Musical in London's West End (2013) and the track is consistently employed as a ubiquitous 1980's presence in countless Hollywood movie soundtracks and TV advertising campaigns throughout the world. Other Projects / Management Pickett recorded the 1984 Olympic Games theme song, Destiny with MCA. Jon Moss from Culture Club contributed with drums and the single cover was created by fashion illustrator Tony Viramontes.Rhys-Morgan, Dean. Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of 1980's Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes, London: Lawrence King Publishing Ltd., 2013 , p.33 In 1989 Pickett discovered charismatic Nigerian singer songwriter Keziah Jones busking in Portobello Road London, a relationship that soon evolved into management. After considerable initial success, the two parted company in 1994 but are back together again 17 years on, when the by now highly successful performer and recording artist approached Phil in 2010 for exclusive representation a second time around. Phil's management company, Rugged Management LLP now manages Keziah and a few other selected artists and projects. Phil Pickett was actively involved in the successful PPL campaign for the 'Extension of Copyright Term' from 50 to 70 years recently where on behalf of the PPL and the Musicians Union he gave a speech at the Houses of Parliament in 2009 in front of MP's journalists and government ministers. More recently, in 2012 he was voted on to the board at B.A.S.C.A. (The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors) and as a previous Ivor winner, is currently involved in helping to set up a contemporary televised national songwriting competition. In December 2012 Phil Pickett signed a long term administration / publishing deal for his back catalogue and current and future songs with Imagem Music Publishers / Boosey and Hawkes. Throughout a long career in the music industry, Phil Pickett has also been associated with a huge variety of artists, writers and producers including Phil Ramone, Quincy Jones, Arif Mardin, Stewart Levine, Paul McCartney, Joe Cocker, Jeff Beck, Take That, Malcolm McLaren and has written songs for West End musical theatre Casper & The Mask and Hollywood movies, including Electric Dreams Top Secret! and The Lost Boys In July 2015 Phil Pickett was invited to join the elite songwriting fraternity - The Society Of Distinguished Songwriters The Society Of Distinguished Songwriters - Sailor Official Fanclub Page or \\"S.O.D's\\" as they are commonly known in the business.

Bheem then meets Santrik, who tells him that the only way to get prisoners free from Damyaan's capture is defeating the demon by destroying the Book of Magi. Then Santrik sends them back in time where the while trying to find the Book of Magi, the Kaalsainiks (the henchmen of Damyaan) figure out that Bheem and his team are not from Sonapur and they don't allow them to enter. A fight ensues, and in the process, Dholu and Bholu are turned into frogs. Bheem somehow manages to defeat them and dons their clothes along with his friends and enters Sonapur pretending to be a bunch of Kaalsainiks. Soon another group of Kaalsainiks arrive and a sweet shop owner named Gulabchand figures out that Bheem and his team are not Kaalsainiks and manages to save the group. In the process Bheem is wounded and faints while passing through the magical door. Upon regaining consciousness, he observes that Dholu and Bholu have regained their respective human forms. The sage who saves them, Guru Sambhu, tells them that despite being brave and strong, they cannot defeat Damyaan without magic. He then takes them to a magical place and through a song (Jam Jam Jamboora), teaches magic to the group. After completing their class on magic, he provides them with powers: Raju gets a magical bow and arrow which never misses its aim; Chutki gets two magical trees; Jaggu a bunch of magical stinging bananas; Kaalia the power to become invisible; Dholu and Bholu the power to multiply into a hundred Dholus and Bholus and Bheem gets an hymn to seize the power of the enemy which was not decoded till date. At night they hear sounds of celebrations, which are of the end of the second term of Damyaan's Kaalkriya (the process of his resurrection), which involves trapping ghosts for their powers in three different rings in three terms by using the hymns given the Book of Magi. Bheem and his team are teleported to Damyaan's castle. Using their respective powers, they manage to seize the first ring, but while seizing the second ring, Kaalia activates a trap which covers them in a strange gas. Upon recovering, Bheem comes to know that they have been captured by Damyaan. Damyaan tells Bheem that in an hour it will be Bheem's birthday and that he has decided to give him a \\"birthday gift\\"- watching his friends die. In an instant, Bheem decodes the hymn and releases his friends. They fight and defeat the Kaalsainiks while Bheem challenges Damyaan to fight without magic. Damyaan then transforms into his powerless form, a Naag (snake) with an ambition of ruling the world. Bheem eventually beats up Damyaan and sacrifices him. Then Bheem and his team return to the future to Dholakpur, only to realise that the whole of Dholakpur has fixed a huge party for its hero, Chhota Bheem.It is an excellent ending.  Filming  The animation series Chhota Bheem was launched in 2008. After the huge success of the series Indian animation content producer Green Gold Animation in association with PVR Pictures decided to make a full-length feature film on Chhota Bheem. The movie was directed by Rajiv Chilaka. Animation director of the film was Owell Mina and the music of the film was composed by Sunil Kaushik.  Sequel  Green Gold animation have launched its sequel Chhota Bheem and The Rise of Damyaan which premiered on 27 October 2019 on Pogo TV.  Release and reception  The film released on 18 May 2012 and got a surprise success.

The Eclectic Chronicle, referred to in earlier literature as the New Babylonian Chronicle, is an ancient Mesopotamian account of the highlights of Babylonian history during the post-Kassite era prior to the 689 BC fall of the city of Babylon. It is an important source of historiography from the period of the early iron-age dark- age with few extant sources to support its telling of events.  The text  Although its provenance is unknown, it is thought to originate from Babylon itself as it is written in standard Babylonian in the late cuneiform script of the region. It was acquired by the British Museum in 1898 and given the accession number 98,0711.124, subsequently the Museum reference BM 27859. Approximately two-thirds of the text has survived with the top part of the tablet broken off, losing the beginning and end of the narrative. The work is written in a single column on a small tablet in the format of an administrative or economic text, suggesting it was for private use, in marked contrast to the official histories that were typically inscribed in two or more columns on a much larger object. In many respects this chronicle shares the characteristics of Chronicle P, as an episodic and laconic summary of the significant events of Babylonian history, but without the errors of that other work. It seems to have been a continuation, covering the post-Kassite period beginning prior to the reign of Marduk-≈°ƒÅpik-zƒìri (ca. 1082‚Äì1069 BC) through to sometime after that of SalmƒÅnu-a≈°arid V (727‚Äì722 BC).

The proposed highway would serve as an outer orbital beltway around the built-up areas of Brampton and Vaughan that would permit traffic travelling between Southwestern Ontario and Ontario's cottage country or Northern Ontario to bypass much of the Greater Toronto Area. However, the highway has attracted criticism for its environmental impacts, including concerns about its footprint on designated farmland in the Greenbelt and allegations it will encourage urban sprawl and induce road traffic.Proposed highway to pave parts of Greenbelt proving controversialGTA West highway: Forward thinking or retro mistake? No funding has been identified to construct the highway and the earliest possible start of construction is in the 2020s.GTA West FAQs In December 2015, the Ministry of Transport suspended the environmental assessment process because Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca was waiting for a report from the advisory panel.https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/7271111-fate-of- future-400-series-highway-through-vaughan-still-up-in-air/ However, on November 15, 2018, the new Progressive Conservative Ontario government announced it would be resuming the suspended Environmental Assessment for the GTA West Corridor.https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/fallstatement/2018/chapter-1c.html#section-5 Proposed Route Current proposals for the route place its starting point at the interchange of Highway 401 and Highway 407 ETR at Steeles Avenue and Ninth Line at the Halton‚ÄìPeel boundary. The freeway would orbit the western and northern fringes of Brampton, providing access to Highway 410. Beyond Brampton it would travel eastwards to connect with Highway 400, passing south of Bolton and north of Kleinburg. The freeway would feature an interchange with Highway 427 upon completion of the northward extension of that route. History The GTA West Corridor was identified in the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe in 2005. At that time, further study was deemed necessary to refine the corridor and define what kind of transportation facilities, if any, should be constructed. Early concepts of the GTA West Corridor involved a longer route running east-west between Guelph and Highway 400 that did not intersect Highways 401 or 407. A potential freeway in such a corridor, when combined with the planned expanded Highway 7, would result in a lengthy parallel route to the north of Highway 401 from Waterloo Region to Highway 400. However, analysis showed limited demand for such a route, and the environmental consequences of a new crossing of the Niagara Escarpment were considerable. By 2011, these concepts were discarded and planning focused on an orbital concept that would intersect with Highway 401 in Milton or Halton Hills to the east of the existing crossing of the Niagara Escarpment. A preliminary study area map released in March 2011 proposed a bypass that would run around the southeastern edges of Halton Hills, lying approximately five to eight kilometres north of Highway 401, running primarily parallel before terminating in Milton. A revised preliminary study area in June 2012 since eliminated this proposal, instead proposing a widening of Highway 401 west of Highway 407 through Milton.http://www.gta- west.com/pdf/2-2011/6720-GTAW%20Preliminary%20Route%20Planning%20Study%20Area.pdfhttp://www.gta- west.com/pdf/11-15-12/Preliminary%20Route%20Planning%20Study%20Area%20Nov%202012.pdf With the corridor refined into a defined route planning area, Stage 1 of the GTA West Corridor Environmental Assessment was completed in November 2012.GTA West Stage 1 Archive Stage 2 began in February 2014 with the objective to developing a preliminary design for a highway within that route planning area.GTA West Stage 2 Schedule On December 16, 2015, the Minister of Transportation, Steven Del Duca announced that he was suspending the environmental assessment process and that the project would be reviewed with an update promised in 2016. On February 9, 2018, the Ontario government cancelled building the highway for the GTA West Corridor because the expert advisory panel's recommendation stated that a proposed highway in the GTA West corridor is not the best way to address changing transportation needs.https://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2018/02/ontario-not-moving-forward-with- highway-for-gta-west-corridor.html On November 15, 2018, the new Progressive Conservative Ontario government announced it would be resuming the suspended Environmental Assessment for the GTA West Corridor, in order to speed up travel and alleviate traffic congestion.https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/fallstatement/2018/chapter-1c.html#section-5 In September and October 2019, a series of Public Information Centres were held in which the preferred route and interchange locations were announced. On August 7, 2020, the province confirmed the preferred route of the highway. This included changes to the location of one interchange. The proposed interchanges (with original location mentioned) are at the following locations: *The Highway 401/407 interchange *Winston Churchill Boulevard south of Embleton Road *Bovaird Drive west of Mississauga Road *Mayfield Road west of Mississauga Road *Chinguacousy Road south of Old School Road *Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) north of Old School Road *An extension of (realigned) Highway 410 north of Old School Road *Bramalea Road north of Old School Road *Airport Road north of Old School Road/Healey Road *The Gore Road south of Healey Road *Humber Station Road north of Mayfield Road (originally proposed interchange with Coleraine Drive north of Mayfield Road) *An extension of Highway 427 northeast of Highway 50 and Nashville Road *Highway 27 north of Kirby Road *Weston Road north of Kirby Road (partial interchange) *Highway 400 north of Kirby Road Halton‚ÄìPeel Freeway The Halton‚ÄìPeel Freeway (or \\"Halton Hills Expressway\\") is a related highway proposal. From 2007 to 2010, in parallel to the stage 1 GTA West study being undertaken by the province, the municipalities of Halton Region and Peel Region completed their own study, the Halton-Peel Boundary Area Transportation Study (HPBATS). HPBATS recommended a north-south freeway east of Georgetown and west of Brampton that would connect in the north with a potential east-west GTA West highway.Halton- Peel Boundary Area Transportation StudyReport calls for new freeway and Norval bypass At the time, it was not clear if a potential GTA West highway would arc around the northwestern edge of Brampton and run along this corridor, and the Halton-Peel Freeway was put forward as a potential complementary project.

It is a MEK inhibitor drug with anti-cancer activity. It inhibits MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib had good results for metastatic melanoma carrying the BRAF V600E mutation in a phase III clinical trial. In this mutation, the amino acid valine (V) at position 600 within the BRAF protein has become replaced by glutamic acid (E) making the mutant BRAF protein constitutively active. In May 2013, trametinib was approved as a single-agent by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with V600E mutated metastatic melanoma. Clinical trial data demonstrated that resistance to single-agent trametinib often occurs within 6 to 7 months. To overcome this, trametinib was combined with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. As a result of this research, on January 8, 2014, the FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. On May 1, 2018, the FDA approved the combination dabrafenib/trametinib as an adjuvant treatment for BRAF V600E-mutated, stage III melanoma after surgical resection based on the results of the COMBI-AD phase 3 study, making it the first oral chemotherapy regimen that prevents cancer relapse for node positive, BRAF-mutated melanoma.  Other uses  In a person with a sequence variant in the ARAF gene, trametinib helped the lymphatic system to remodel toward a healthier state, reducing lymphatic edema. This benefit would not occur in most people because it is specific to genomes similar to the reported one, but it is potentially lifesaving for the few people with such genomes. This case provides an example of what precision medicine can accomplish.

The organization was active between 1985 and 1993. At its height the National Union of the Homeless had over 20 local unions and 15,000 members. Background The 1980s saw large increase in homeless throughout the United States. While the economy was ailing, the 1980s saw dramatic cuts in Federal spending on housing by the Reagan Administration. In the eight years of the Regan Administration federal housing spending dropped from $28.7 billion to $9.5 billion. This is exactly the period where the United States is saw its most active and largest organizing of homeless people around homeless issues. In 1983 Chris Sprowal, Tex Howard, and Franklyn Smith founded Committee for Dignity and Fairness for the Homeless in Philadelphia. In 1984, the Committee founded the Dignity Shelter in Philadelphia, the first ever homeless shelter founded and run by homeless people. The Committee also help found the Philadelphia/Delaware Valley Union for the Homeless which began to organize around homeless issues. They got homeless people 24-hour intake in city shelters, the right to vote, and (by staging bath-ins at public fountains) public showers. The union went national, spreading to 13 cities by 1986. The National Union of the Homeless was officially founded in 1985 in Philadelphia. In November 1986 the Tompkins Square Union of the Homeless, the New York City local, was formed.  Campaigns  In 1986 NUH launched what was called a \\"Winter Offensive\\" under the slogan of ‚ÄúHomes and Jobs: Not Death in the Streets.\\" The offensive included organizing drives of the locals across the country, civil disobedience actions, and tribunals for community leaders about the vicious cycle for people living on the streets. In 1988 NUH launched the \\"Take Off the Boards\\" Campaign where the group began to organize housing takeovers across the country. In 1988 NUM took over 11 VA owned houses in Philadelphia as part of the national campaign. Housing Now! March and HUD Demonstration In October 1989 NUM help organize a Housing Now! march on Washington, D.C., in 1989. The event would be co-organized by the National Coalition for the Homeless, National Low-Income Housing Coalition, and Voices for Creative Non-violence NUH wanted militant nonviolent disobedience to push issues of the homeless to forefront. However, one of the funders of the march, the AFL-CIO, wanted a peaceful and legal event so other three organizations pushed against civil disobedience. In the end, NUH agreed to the legal march and would mobilize the homeless, however, they would end up planning a separate more confrontational protest the day before the Housing Now! Rally. On October 6, 1989 about 600 people from 23 cities descended on the HUD headquarters in Washington, D.C. NUM demanded to meet with the Secretary of HUD or barricade the building. National Union of the Homeless met with the Secretary of HUD, Jack Kemp, to talk about the severe problem of homelessness and what HUD was going to do to help solve it. Kemp made significant concessions by promising that 10% of HUD's vacant housing stock would be turned over to homeless people in the coming year. Larger amounts of vacant housing would be turned over to the homeless in following years. Kemp ultimately broke his promise, and in response, poor and homeless cities began breaking in and taking over these HUD homes. NUH's HUD-Targeted Takeover Campaign In May 1990 NUH coordinated takeovers empty federally owned of houses in New York, Minneapolis, Detroit, Los Angeles, Tucson, Oakland, Chicago and Philadelphia. The Philadelphia/Delaware Valley Union of the Homeless, a NUH local took over 10 HUD homes in the Spring in order get HUD to turn over the Section 8 vouchers to Dignity Housing, who places homeless people in permanent housing. In December, HUD relented agreeing to release 123 vouchers in return for the squatters leaving the HUD-owned homes. The Oakland Union of the Homeless, a NUH local, took over 3 houses in 1990 and successfully petitioned California for an allocation of $1 million to the building of Dignity Housing West, an Oakland low-income housing development. The 26-unit James Lee Court Apartments came from this demand, as did 46 other units in Oakland. Organizing model The National Union of the Homeless used what was called a \\"Johnnie Tillmon model\\" of organizing, named for the woman who was the first chair of the National Welfare Rights Organization. The model was based two central principles: 1) Poverty victims must be at the forefront of the movement to end poverty and 2) You only get what you are organized to take. Stemming from principles NUM stressed five interdependent ingredients of organizing: 1) teams of organizers identifying and organizing around issues on which people are prepared to act; 2) bases operation often associated with survival; 3) mutual support networks with wide-ranging organizations of poor folks and allies; 4) internal and external lines and of communication; 5) nationally connected and educated leaders trained in political and consciousness raising strategy able to unite diverse but related struggles.

TRICO I was the first nuclear reactor on the African continent. History Ceremony commemorating the activation of the first Congolese nuclear reactor with Lovanium University rector Luc Gillon, Governor-General of the Congo Hendrik Cornelis, and Minister of Colonies Maurice van Hemelrijck In 1956, prior to the independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from Belgium, Luc Gillon rector of Lovanium University launched the idea of establishing a research reactor at the university. In 1958, the government of Belgian Congo, with the approval of the Belgian minister of Congo and Ruanda- Urundi bought a TRIGA MARK I reactor from General Atomics. The Trico Center was constructed to house the reactor and opened in 1959. It was built on land belonging to the science and medical faculties of the Lovanium University (later University of Kinshasa). Post independence, at the 1967 Organisation of African Unity summit in Kinshasa African heads of state decided to transform Trico Center into a regional study center. Despite OAU recommendations, the center has only been operated by Congolese. From 1970 onwards it is known as CREN-K, Regional Center for Nuclear studies (). CREN-K purchased a new reactor, TRICO II, with a larger capacity. In 1968 the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Belgium signed general agreements on continued technological and scientific cooperation. Five years later in 1973 a specific agreement on cooperation of peaceful nuclear research was signed between Belgium and then Zaire. The agreements after several extensions lasted until 1987. In practise it meant that SCK‚Ä¢CEN assisted CREN-K in the construction and yearly maintenance of TRICO II. The Institute for Radioactive Elements (IRE) in Fleurus Belgium assisted CREN-K in the production of medical isotopes. In return CREN-K agreed to also run research programs proposed by mutually recognized Belgian institutions. The TRICO II reactor is subject to yearly IAEA inspections. In 1988 IAEA started a project to deliver replacement parts and new nuclear fuel. Because the American company General Dynamics Corporation, which had been contracted to deliver these parts, was unable to fulfil its obligations due to an embargo imposed on the Mobutu government. In exchange for spare parts and training seminars from the IAEA the Democratic Republic of the Congo participates in RAF and AFRA projects. The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo stopped adequately funding the project in the late 1980s. In 1998 it was reported that despite the lack of funds dedicated personnel kept the reactor in good shape. By this time the IAEA cooperation still had trouble locating replacement parts. Because spent fuel was not being replaced the reactor was only capable of operating at reduced capacity. In 2004 the reactor was shutdown for a scheduled stop and has been in a state of extended shutdown since. Since 2010 there have been renewed campaigns to gather more support among the public opinion for CREN-K and utilizing the national resource that is uranium. Management The Commissariat G√©n√©ral √† l‚ÄôEnergie Atomique (CGEA) is responsible for nuclear energy, CREN-K and its reactors. It was previously known as the Commissariat des Sciences Nucl√©aires. It is a state-owned company under the supervision of the scientific research department of MESU, the Ministry of Higher Education (). As foreseen by law CGEA's articles of association describe three structures. Namely a Board of directors, a management committee, and a committee of auditors. However currently only the management committee exists and it is identical to the management committee of CREN-K. The committee consists out of a Commissioner General, director of science, CFO and a staff representative. In 2010, CGEA/CREN-K employed 175 people. In June 2011 the Congolese government appointed Lukanda Mwamba Vincent as Commissioner General of CGEA. Reactors \\"TRICO\\" is a portmanteau of the names TRIGA ‚àí the type of reactor ‚àí and Congo. TRICO I A 50 kW TRIGA MARK I reactor. Initial criticality June 6, 1959. The reactor was shut down June 29, 1970. It has been dismantled but not fully decommissioned. The reactor was used for training, fundamental research and for the production of agricultural and medical isotopes. TRICO II A 1 MW TRIGA MARK II reactor. Initial criticality March 24, 1972. The reactor has been in extended shutdown since 2004. The reactor was used for training, fundamental research, isotope production and material characterization. TRICO II uses uranium fuel enriched to 20%. CGEA intends to restart the reactor in the future. However to do this replacement parts are needed among which a $3 million digital control bay. Security and safety Erosion in the city Mama Mobutu, Mont Ngafula, near the University International observers have long been concerned about the safety and security of the two nuclear reactors and the enriched uranium they contain. In 1998, a wall in the Regional Center for Nuclear Studies collapsed when torrential rains undermined the building's foundation. International Atomic Energy Agency officials have voiced concerns that the ongoing issue with erosion could lead to an accident that might contaminate the city of Kinshasa's water supply. Further concerns about the site were raised when, in 1999, an object that might have been a missile, struck the building and caused light damage. The program has also had an ongoing issue with the disappearance of nuclear material that could be used by terrorists or rogue states. Several rods of highly enriched uranium (HEU) have disappeared from the reactors since the late 1970s. In 1998, a sting operation led by the Italian police seized a rod of HEU that weighed 190 grams. It was built by General Atomics in the early 1970s and shipped to Zaire for use in the TRICO II reactor. The rod was in the possession of an Italian mafia group that was trying to sell it for $12.8 million, possibly to a Middle Eastern country. In 2007, the research center's director Fortunat Lumu and an aide were arrested and questioned about the disappearance of a large quantity of nuclear material, which local media reported was as much as 100 bars of uranium. In 2010, leaked diplomatic cables reported on the troublesome security and safety situation. Including manioc farming adjacent to a building storing nuclear waste. In 2012, Vincent Lukanda (CGEA Commissar-General) declared that CREN-K was no longer threatened by erosion, and that the Congolese government was committed to protecting and modernizing the nuclear site, citing investments into a new perimeter fence. In 2018, an IAEA expert team concluded that organisational and technical improvements were needed for the safety of the shutdown reactor \\"particularly considering the country's decision to bring the reactor back into operation\\".

They are Egyptians who have ancestry originating from the Levant, mostly what is now Syria and Lebanon. The majority of Egypt's historic Syro-Lebanese community is Christian, mainly Eastern Catholic (Melkite and Maronite) and Eastern Orthodox, although some families are also Muslim (Shia and Sunni) and Jewish. Since antiquity, there has always been a Levantine presence in Egypt, however, they started becoming a distinctive minority in Egypt around the early 18th century. The majority of Syro-Lebanese migrants who arrived in Egypt during this time were French-speaking and highly influenced by the European Culture. By the dawn of the 20th century, the Syro-Lebanese of Egypt were considered a powerful and cosmopolitan community that played an important role in both Egypt's economy and culture. Due to the rise in nationalism along with the loss of economic freedoms during the 1950s, a part of Egypt's Syro-Lebanese community left the country immigrating to the Americas, Europe, and Australia, as well as many returning to their native Lebanon (especially Beirut) and Syria. Notable descendants of Egypt's Syro-Lebanese community include the world-renowned Egyptian actor Omar Sharif (born Michel Chalhoub) and Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine. History The relations between Egypt and the Levant go back to ancient times. However, the earliest instance of modern Levantine migration to Egypt happened after 1724, when a schism in the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch resulted in a separate branch of Levantine Christians attached to Rome known as the Melkite Greek Catholics. Once the Syrian and Lebanese Greek Orthodox community was split, a migratory flow resulted in which Melkite Greek Catholics began leaving cities such as Damascus, Aleppo, Zahle, and Sidon to move to Egypt. Regarding an early Maronite presence in Egypt dating from the 18th century, it is said that the Holy see of Rome appointed two Maronite priests to serve as advisers to the Franciscans who came from the Custody of the Holy Land to evangelize Egypt because \\"no one knows the land and mentality of the Coptic Christians like the Maronites\\".235x235pxLater during the mid-1800s, due to the political conflict that existed in Lebanon and Syria between the Christian and Druze religious sects, many Syrian and Lebanese Christians, as well as Palestinian and Jordanian Christians to some extent, migrated to Egypt under the rule of Muhammad Ali Pasha. These Syro-Lebanese or Levantine Christians, known in Egyptian Arabic as the \\"Shawam\\", were either of Greek Orthodox or Catholic (Melkite or Maronite) extraction. The reason immigrants from Lebanon and Syria were considered one ethnic group was because during the mid-1800s, Lebanon was not yet an independent state and was still part of Ottoman Syria, or \\"Bilad al-Sham\\" in Arabic, hence their label as \\"Shawam\\" or \\"Shami\\". Muhammad Ali Pasha endorsed various ethnic and religious groups, including Syro-Lebanese, Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Italians, and Maltese to settle in Egypt. From the building of the Suez Canal to the creation of modern Downtown Cairo, Egypt‚Äôs rulers went on a spending spree that attracted migrants from across the world. The Syro-Lebanese, who first migrated were French-speaking and well-educated (largely due to European and American missionaries), had a mindset in the British-run economy of Egypt at the time. As a result, they were able to flourish as an energetic and cosmopolitan community until the Nasser era of the mid-1950s, that adopted an Arabization mind set for the entire region. Most of the Syro-Lebanese were self-employed businessmen or craftsmen and had more of a \\"Westernized\\" education than others. Robert Sol√©, a French author of Levantine-Egyptian descent, describes all of these aspects of the Syro- Lebanese community in Egypt in his book, \\"Birds of Passage\\", as well as in his other publications. The Syro-Lebanese established Melkite Greek-Catholic and Maronite Catholic churches throughout many areas of Egypt such as Cairo, Alexandria, Mansoura, Suez, Port Said, and Tanta. The Greek Orthodox Syro- Lebanese experienced conflict trying to establish their own churches under their native Antiochian denomination, and became under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which was mainly run by an ethnic Greek clergy. In Egypt, many families of Syro-Lebanese origin became successful in Egypt's business sector along with the established Armenian and Greek communities. Many were involved in Egypt's booming cotton industry. The famous Egyptian newspaper, \\"Al-Ahram\\", was created by the Syro-Lebanese Takla family in Egypt. Syro-Lebanese families dominated the publishing industry, owning major printing houses like Dar al-Hilal (est. 1892), which gave them enormous influence on the country‚Äôs cultural life. Even Rose al-Yusuf, the quintessential Egyptian cultural figure from the first half of the twentieth century, was originally Levantine of Turkish descent. The (then) irreverent political and literary magazine she founded and named after herself continues to this day, albeit in state hands like Al-Ahram. Even the material culture of Cairo has been suffused by Syro-Lebanese influence. The most prolific architect in Central Cairo between the 1930s and 1960s was Antoine Selim Nahas, who is seen as the one of the modernist architects in Egypt. Nahas, who built among other important buildings the Beirut National Museum, established a wildly successful practice in Cairo, where he designed buildings for the rich and famous, often Levantine-Egyptians like himself, such as the actor Farid al-Atrash. alt=Even though the number of Levantine-Egyptians still in Egypt is drastically low today, the Syro-Lebanese community retains its strength in some aspects of the cultural and entertainment industries. Cairo‚Äôs most famous restaurant entrepreneur, Nisha Sursock, comes from a prominent Beirut Greek Orthodox family. The Levantine community in Egypt counted more than 100,000 members at the turn of the 20th century: civil servants, hairdressers, cobblers, drivers, engineers, dentists, doctors, shopkeepers, painters. Their aggregate wealth was reckoned at one and a half billion francs, that is 10% of the Egyptian GDP. Those who had capital invested it in small businesses (oil, soaps, tobacco, patisserie). Others created more important companies trading or producing salt, sodium, textiles, perfume, wood, silk. This economic success led to the foundation of schools, clubs, and charities, generally linked to a place of worship which was most of the time a church. A minority returned to their home village but the majority remained ‚Äúsemi-detached‚Äù, settling for several generations in Egypt without for all that involving themselves fully in the host society. In Mansoura, a city that used to be under huge French and European influence. The Levantines excelled equally as lawyers, cotton trade entrepreneurs, large real-estate owners, medical doctors and pharmacists, department store and restaurant and hotel owners, bankers, and financial agents. They were also renowned for their large estates, like the heirs of Comte Khalil de Saab and the Sussah family, Nagib Sursock, and the 'izba of George Daoud. They owned several international hotels. For instance, Khalil Bahari owned the Semiramis Hotel, which included the best restaurant in Mansoura. Dhaher al-Rayyes was the owner of the largest hotel in Mansoura, the Paris Hotel, while his brother, Bichara, owned the Claridge Hotel, and a third brother owned the Imperial Hotel. The Shawam of Mansoura occupied key positions as medical doctors, showing why nearly half of the doctors in Mansoura used to be foreigners at that time, mainly Europeans. Levantines also notably became bank managers. Some Shawam earned the titles of Count, like Count Saab and Count Chedid. Others earned the titles of Pasha and Bek, while a few even earned the title of Emir (Prince), like the Lutfallah, and subsequently the Sursock, family. Identity The term \\"Syro-Lebanese\\" or \\"Syrian-Lebanese\\" is an umbrella term to identify the people of the Levant, especially the generations who lived when most of the region was known as Bilad al-Sham, or Greater Syria. Between the late 18th century and early 20th century, thousands of Levantines left their homeland, mainly due to warfare, and Egypt became the first stop for many who aimed to reach the Western world. In Egypt, as well as other nations with Syrian and Lebanese diaspora communities, the Levantines mainly identified by religion and city of origin, rather than by ethnicity. For example, one could identify as a \\"Greek Catholic from Zahle\\", while another could identify as \\"Greek Orthodox from Aleppo\\". For the most part, religious denomination and city of origin were more important to the Levantines than an actual \\"Levantine\\" or \\"Syro-Lebanese\\" identity. This may explain why it was generally easy for the Syro-Lebanese to assimilate into their newly found homelands and mix with other Christian populations, especially in Egypt. However, the Egyptians, and especially the Coptic Orthodox Christians, could easily point out a Levantine's non-native background due to their foreign Christian background, if not by their overall lighter skin tone. After generations of living in Egypt, most of this community's descendants, now with Egyptian nationality, tended to identify more as \\"Egyptian\\", rather than \\"Levantine\\", \\"Syrian\\", or \\"Lebanese\\", while still maintaining their original Christian sect of identity. However, intermarriage for the Levantines in Egypt eventually became more common after generations, either with native Coptic Christians whom are in millions or with other foreign minority Christians such as Greeks, Armenians, and Maltese. There was much less intermarriage between Levantine Christians and native Muslims, as marriage between Christians and Muslims is still considered taboo in Egypt. Churches Christianity is the dominant religion among Egyptians of Syro-Lebanese descent. The majority follow Greek Orthodox (originally Greek Orthodox Antiochian, but then falling under Greek Orthodox Alexandrian jurisdiction in Egypt), a founder sect of Christianity since the Greco-Roman Egypt, Melkite Greek Catholic Church and the Maronite Church. With Catholic education being popular among Christian families in Egypt, many Levantines also naturally attended Roman Catholic churches. ‚Ä¢ Greek Orthodox & Catholic Churches in Egypt: * Cairo - Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Resurrection, Greek Catholic Annunciation Church, Greek Catholic Immaculate Conception Church, Greek Catholic St. George Church, Greek Catholic St. Mary of Peace Church, Greek Catholic St. Joseph Church, Greek Catholic St. Cyril Church * Alexandria - Greek Catholic Dormition Cathedral, Saint Sabbas Greek Orthodox Church, Greek Catholic Immaculate Conception, Greek Catholic St. Joseph, * Damanhur - Saints Constantine and Helena Greek Orthodox Church * Damietta - Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, and an old Greek Catholic Church that was converted to a Coptic Orthodox Church. * El-Mahalla El-Kubra - Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Augustine Catholic Church * Mansoura - Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Saints Athanasius and Cyril Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition Greek Catholic Church * Port Said - Saint Elias Greek Catholic Church * Shibin Al Kawm - Saint Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church * Tanta - Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition of the Holy Virgin Greek Orthodox Church, Presentation of the Lord Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Anne Greek Catholic Church * Zagazig - Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition of the Holy Virgin Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Joseph Catholic Church Diaspora The number of Syro-Lebanese in Egypt has decreased due to the nationalization policies of the Nasser government after the 1952 revolution. As a result, there has been extensive migrations to other countries such as Canada, the United States, France, Australia, Switzerland, and Belgium. The remaining Syro-Lebanese in Egypt began integrating into the rest of Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with Coptic Christians and Muslims. Today, most Egyptians of Levantine roots tend to identify more as Egyptian rather than Syrian or Lebanese, even though some traditionally belong to Christian denominations like Greek Orthodox other than Egypt's native Coptic Orthodox, Coptic Catholic, or native Protestant churches. A large number of Syro- Lebanese families from Egypt now reside in Montreal; The communities of St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church, Saint-Sauveur Melkite Greek-Catholic Cathedral, and St. Maron Church (Maronite Catholic), have many parishioners who are from Egypt or are descendants of Egyptian immigrants. Records from 1987 show that up to 250 families out of the total 1,300 registered families of St. George's Antiochian Orthodox Church of Montreal were originally from Egypt. In that same year, the Melkite Saint Sauveur Cathedral of Montreal reported to have approximately two-thirds of its 3,000 registered families originating from Egypt. Records from the St. Maron Church in Montreal show that out of its total 1,284 registered families in 1987, 600 of them were Maronites from Egypt.

MT may be based on a set of linguistic rules, or on large bodies (corpora) of already existing parallel texts. Rule-based methodologies may consist in a direct word-by-word translation, or operate via a more abstract representation of meaning: a representation either specific to the language pair, or a language-independent interlingua. Corpora-based methodologies rely on machine learning and may follow specific examples taken from the parallel texts, or may calculate statistical probabilities to select a preferred option out of all possible translations.  Rule-based and corpus-based machine translation  Rule-based machine translation (RBMT) is generated on the basis of morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis of both the source and the target languages. Corpus-based machine translation (CBMT) is generated on the analysis of bilingual text corpora. The former belongs to the domain of rationalism and the latter empiricism. Given large-scale and fine-grained linguistic rules, RBMT systems are capable of producing translations with reasonable quality, but constructing the system is very time-consuming and labor-intensive because such linguistic resources need to be hand-crafted, frequently referred to as knowledge acquisition problem. Moreover, it is of great difficulty to correct the input or add new rules to the system to generate a translation. By contrast, adding more examples to a CBMT system can improve the system since it is based on the data, though the accumulation and management of the huge bilingual data corpus can also be costly.  Direct, transfer and interlingual machine translation  The direct, transfer-based machine translation and interlingual machine translation methods of machine translation all belong to RBMT but differ in the depth of analysis of the source language and the extent to which they attempt to reach a language- independent representation of meaning or intent between the source and target languages. Their dissimilarities can be obviously observed through the Vauquois Triangle, which illustrates these levels of analysis. Starting with the shallowest level at the bottom, direct transfer is made at the word level. Depending on finding direct correspondences between source language and target language lexical units, DMT is a word-by-word translation approach with some simple grammatical adjustments. A DMT system is designed for a specific source and target language pair and the translation unit of which is usually a word. Translation is then performed on representations of the source sentence structure and meaning respectively through syntactic and semantic transfer approaches. A transfer-based machine translation system involves three stages. The first stage makes analysis of the source text and converts it into abstract representations; the second stage converts those into equivalent target language-oriented representations; and the third generates the final target text. The representation is specific for each language pair. The transfer strategy can be viewed as ‚Äúa practical compromise between the efficient use of resources of interlingual systems, and the ease of implementation of direct systems‚Äù . Finally, at the interlingual level, the notion of transfer is replaced by the interlingua. The IMT operates over two phases: analyzing the SL text into an abstract universal language-independent representation of meaning, i.e. the interlingua, which is the phase of analysis; generating this meaning using the lexical units and the syntactic constructions of the TL, which is the phase of synthesis. Theoretically, the higher the triangle, the less cost the analysis and synthesis. For example, to translate one SL to N TLs, (1+N) steps are needed using an interlingua compared to N steps of transfer. But to translate all the languages, only 2N steps are needed by the IMT approach compared to N¬≤ by the TBMT approach, which is a significant reduction. Though no transfer component has to be created for each language pair by adopting the approach of IMT, the definition of an interlingua is of great difficulty and even maybe impossible for a wider domain.  Statistical and example-based machine translation  Statistical machine translation (SMT) is generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora. The initial model of SMT, based on Bayes Theorem, proposed by Brown et al. takes the view that every sentence in one language is a possible translation of any sentence in the other and the most appropriate is the translation that is assigned the highest probability by the system. Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is characterized by its use of bilingual corpus with parallel texts as its main knowledge, in which translation by analogy is the main idea. There are four tasks in EBMT: example acquisition, example base and management, example application and synthesis. Both belonging to CBMT, sometimes referred to as data-driven MT, EBMT and SMT have something in common which distinguish them from RBMT. First, they both use a bitext as the fundamental data source. Second, they are both empirical with the principle of machine learning instead of rational with the principle of linguists writing rules. Third, they both can be improved by getting more data. Fourth, new language pairs can be developed just by finding suitable parallel corpus data, if possible. Apart from these similarities, there are also some dissimilarities. SMT essentially uses statistical data such as parameters and probabilities derived from the bitext, in which preprocessing the data is essential and even if the input is in the training data, the same translation is not guaranteed to occur. By contrast, EBMT uses the bitext as its primary data source, in which preprocessing the data is optional and if the input is in the example set, the same translation is to occur.

He was born in 1445 to a noble family of Venice. He may have first travelled to Alexandria, Egypt in 1462, as a young man. At age 25, he entered the monastery of San Francesco della Vigna in Venice. His skills at travel may have played a role to his assignment as a guardian in the convent of Beirut, Lebanon in 1480-1481. At sometime in 1485, with the help from a nun, Sister Catherine Guarnieri da Osimo acting as a scribe in the Monastery of St Clares in Foligno, Francesco wrote his treatise: Il trattato di Terra Santa e dell'Oriente By Francesco Suriano, republished in 1900 by Girolamo Golubovich. Suriano‚Äôs treatise is tendentious, imbued with a great deal of religiosity, and justifications of the superiority of Catholicism to all other religions. It is also stained by bigotry, aimed at Orthodox Christians, who he viewed as heretical, and Muslims and Jews, who he viewed as despicable. In chapter 1 of the second part, he claims Muhammad was descended of Ishmaelites.Page 191. For example, he enumerates all the different sects that share the custody of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. But in Chapter 38, he evinces his deep anti-semitism. He claims that among all sects and religions, Jews are maligned and mistreated by all, as is the ‚Äújust judgement of God‚Äô‚Äô. Even in Jerusalem, where he claims they committed the sin for which God had dispersed them throughout the world, they suffer and are afflicted. They are splintered into feuding groups. He claims that Muslims hold them in lower regard than Christians, and treat them like dogs, and dare not even touch them.li Sarazeni li strazano como cani. page 89. In addition, it claims they often convert to Islam or Orthodoxy in order to gain in disputes with other Jews. He speaks regarding the location of the cave used by Adam and Eve after being expelled from the Garden, the place where Abraham circumscribed Isaac, the church where the Virgen was buried, where Zacharias and Absalom are buried, the house of Caiphas and Anne, the tomb of the site of the last supper, and the houses and burial plots of many biblical figures as if they still stood and were clearly identified. He claims some of the orders are sustained by the patronage of European royalty. He also mentions a trip to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai. The text is often interrupted with prayers, and he discusses miracles and indulgences. He also speaks of spices of indo-Asia and of Portuguese towns in India. He also quotes an epistle sent to Prester John (Prete Ianne), by the guardian of Mount Syon, Paulo de Chanedo. The letter addresses the king in Ethiopia, and sends in 1480 priests and teachers to instruct him in the true faith, and extirpate heresies, including Franciscan priest.Chapter 34. He claims the Sultan was fearful of allowing such priest to travel south, because they might cause him to be encircled by Christians. He gives first hand notes of a trip south of Cairo through the Nile for 30 days till arriving to Nachada, from there went west to a town of Acherman, using camels traveled in four days to Chosairo on the Indian Ocean. There they sailed for Sevachim, an Arabian port. From there they went to Achanon, then Alech and Dassi, from where they rode camels to the Moorish town of Menna. From there a trek of fifteen days, they entered Ethiopia and were sent from one prominent man to another, from the town of Maria to Fendun, then Reeldete, then Vaansol. They traveled on mule for nearly two weeks to the Church of the King, and saw an ornate Italianate organ. From there to Chiafeg and Barar, the site of the court. In the court they encountered a number of Italians, who had ventured there in search of jewels and riches, but now found themselves not permitted to leave by the king. He describes Ethiopia as brutish and without invention, almost entirely lacking solid architecture. He describes the soldiers as being branded with the royal symbol. They go shirtless and shoeless. He describes them as pusillanimous in habitus, weak, but zealous in faith and spirit.Chapter 35, page 87 He speaks of ostriches and Giraffes. The former, he claims, eats iron. The latter. Giraphe, he describes as one cubit taller front than back; front legs are longer than hind legs, speckled like leopards...the neck longer than the hind legs, and it is a superb animal and boastful, beautiful to see, the small head, with lively eyes, that brings incredible joy to their caretakers.Hano un' altra sorta de animali chiamati Giraphe, uno cubito pi√π alti davanti che de driedo; le gambe sono pi√π longe de quelle del gambello, pichiarate como leopardi, cum l' ongia spacata ; lo collo longo pi√π che lo gambello; et √® animale superbo e vanaglorioso, bello a vedere, lo capo piccolo, cum le ochio vivo; e tanto allegra la natura humana guardandolo, che √® cosa incredibile.

Formerly known as the Australian Institute of Tropical Medicine, AITHM was established at JCU in 2008. AITHM's focus is on the health problems of most importance to tropical Australia and the tropics worldwide, particularly within Australia‚Äôs geographical region. This focus is reflective of JCU's strategic commitment to \\"Creating a brighter future for life in the tropics worldwide through graduates and discoveries that make a difference\\". The current Director of AITHM is Professor Louis Schofield. Overview AITHM aims to contribute to better health for people in the tropics by developing new prevention, diagnosis and treatment options for diseases that are of importance in the tropical world. This is achieved through biomedical, molecular, genomic, epidemiological, entomological and health systems research that is undertaken within an integrated public health framework. Through its research and innovation, and in partnership with key organisations, AITHM aims to bridge the gap between cutting edge research, disease control methodology and scientific expertise; and health service, workforce and policy delivery relevant to tropical populations. In early 2012, AITHM received a commitment of $42.12 million from the Queensland Government to build essential infrastructure and bolster key research projects. This funding has significantly enhanced AITHM‚Äôs capacity to underpin Australia‚Äôs health security and biosecurity strategies with effective research. The funding is also intended to enhance research to improve health in rural, remote and tropical Australia, in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, and across the tropics regionally and globally. AITHM now has research facilities on both the Townsville and Cairns campuses of James Cook University and on Thursday Island, the main commercial and administrative hub of the Torres Strait. History Anton Breinl, 1910 JCU has a long history in tropical health research, with an established focus on infectious diseases and the health of tropical populations through the Anton Breinl Centre. AITHM‚Äôs research builds on these strong epidemiological and public health foundations. AITHM‚Äôs predecessor, The Australian Institute for Tropical Medicine, was established in Townsville in 1913 and was Australia's first medical research institute.Tropical Health Solutions, ‚ÄòPublications from the Australian Institute for Tropical Medicine: 1903-1930‚Äô Before it was subsumed into the then Commonwealth Department of Health in 1921,James Cook University, 'History of the Australian Institute for Tropical Medicine' the Institute made a significant contribution to understandings about how Europeans could live in and adapt to tropical Australia.Tropical Health Solutions, Publications from the Australian Institute for Tropical Medicine: 1903-1930 The Institute's first director was Dr Anton Breinl, who had previously worked as a medical scientist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

He was the youngest son of Former Shu's first emperor Wang Jian (Emperor Gaozu), but became his heir because his mother Consort Xu was Wang Jian's favorite concubine and was able to gain the support of the chancellor Zhang Ge. Wang Yan's reign was traditionally considered one of decadence, corruption, and incompetence. In 925, his state was conquered by its northeastern neighbor Later Tang. Wang Yan surrendered to the Later Tang army, but was later killed by Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang.  Background  Wang Zongyan was born in 899, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, as the youngest of the 11 sons of Wang Jian, who was then a major warlord late in the Tang Dynasty as the military governor (Jiedushi) of its Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), ruling over modern Sichuan and Chongqing.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. His mother was Lady Xu, a daughter of the official Xu Geng (ÂæêËÄï) and a concubine of Wang Jian's, who became his favorite. (Her younger sister was also a concubine of Wang Jian's; therefore, later when they became imperial consorts, she was known as Consort Xu the Greater, while her sister was known as Consort Xu the Lesser.)Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 38. It was said that Wang Zongyan was capable in literature even in his young age, capable of writing poems. In 907, after the Tang throne was usurped by another major warlord, Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who established his own Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu, Wang Jian, who did not recognize the Later Liang emperor, declared himself the emperor of a new state of Shu (historically known as Former Shu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. In 910, Wang Jian created all of his sons (except his second Wang Yuantan, whom he had earlier created Crown Prince) to be imperial princes, and Wang Zongyan was created the Prince of Zheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 913, Wang Yuantan (whose name had been changed to Wang Yuanying by that point), in a power struggle with the senior official Tang Daoxi, started a military confrontation with Tang and killed him, but was then himself killed. The official Pan Kang urged Wang Jian to quickly create a new crown prince, and Wang Jian initially considered selecting either Wang Zonglu (ÁéãÂÆóËºÖ) the Prince of Ya, whom he considered most like himself, and Wang Zongjie (ÁéãÂÆóÂÇë) the Prince of Xin, whom he considered the most talented. However, Wang Zongyan's mother Consort Xu wanted Wang Zongyan to be created crown prince. She thus entered into an alliance with Tang Wenyi (ÂîêÊñáÊâÜ) the overseer of the imperial stables and the chancellor Zhang Ge. Zhang falsely informed a number of high-level officials, including the senior general (Wang Jian's adoptive son) Wang Zongkan (ÁéãÂÆó‰æÉ), that Wang Jian had settled on Wang Zongyan but wanted their public support. He then drafted a petition to have Wang Zongyan made crown prince, and had Wang Zongkan and the others sign the petition. When Wang Jian received the petition, believing that Wang Zongyan did have the high-level officials' support, he, despite his doubts about Wang Zongyan's abilities, created Wang Zongyan crown prince.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268.  As crown prince  It was said that as crown prince, Wang Zongyan spent time with wine, women, and games. Whenever Wang Jian went past Wang Zongyan's palace and heard the sounds of Wang Zongyan staging cockfights or ballgames with the other princes, he would lament, \\"I fought 100 battles to establish this foundation; can people like this hold firm on it?\\" He therefore came to despise Zhang Ge greatly, but as Zhang was protected by Consort Xu, Wang Jian never actually removed Zhang. However, he considered replacing Wang Zongyan with Wang Zongjie, until Wang Zongjie's death in 918, which Wang Jian found suspicious but apparently did not investigate. Later in 918, Wang Jian himself also fell seriously ill. Believing that his adoptive son, the general Wang Zongbi, was full of strategies and suitable for assisting the young emperor, he summoned Wang Zongbi back from the northern border with Qi and put him in charge of the imperial guards. He summoned the officials to the palace and, apparently still having reservations about Wang Zongyan, stated to them: However, thereafter, Tang Wenyi blocked off access between Wang Jian and the officials, including Wang Zongbi, wanting to hold control of the ill emperor himself. However, Tang's partisan Pan Zaiying (ÊΩòÂú®Ëøé) betrayed his plans to the officials, and the officials forced their way into the palace and had Tang ejected from it (and later executed, as were his brother Tang Wenyi (ÂîêÊñáË£î, note different character) and associate Wang Baohui (Áéã‰øùÊô¶)). Shortly after, Wang Jian, after leaving an edict that put Wang Zongbi, the eunuch Song Guangsi, and other adoptive sons Wang Zongyao (ÁéãÂÆóÁë§), Wang Zongwan (ÁéãÂÆóÁ∂∞), and Wang Zongkui (ÁéãÂÆóÂ§î) in charge of assisting Wang Zongyan, died, and Wang Zongyan took the throne. He changed his name to Wang Yan.  Early reign  After taking the throne, Wang Yan honored his mother Consort Xu the Greater as empress dowager and his aunt Consort Xu the Lesser as consort dowager (ÁöáÂ§™Â¶É, Huang Taifei). He created his wife Crown Princess Gao empress. As Zhang Ge was an associate of Tang Wenyi's, Zhang was exiled. It was said that Wang Yan did not personally handle the affairs of state, instead entrusting all the important decisions to Wang Zongbi. Wang Zongbi, however, was corrupt and accepted many bribes, while Song Guangsi flattered both the emperor and him. This was seen as the beginning of the decline of the Former Shu state. It was also said that Wang Yan, Empress Dowager Xu, and Consort Dowager Xu often spent their times visiting the estates of officials and sceneries, drinking, and reciting poems, and the expenses for escorting them created a drain on the treasury. Further, Empress Dowager Xu and Consort Dowager Xu were also selling political offices, including offices as high as prefectural prefects, for money, further corrupting the political scene. Further, whenever Wang Yan's trusted officials and generals violated laws, he would not issue punishment, such that laws lost their powers. In late 919, one of the major generals, Wang Yan's adoptive brother Wang Zonglang (ÁéãÂÆóÈÉé) the military governor of Xiongwu Circuit (ÈõÑÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Ankang, Shaanxi) was declared to have committed crimes. Wang Yan stripped him of his titles and imperially bestowed name (changing his name back to his original name of Quan Shilang (ÂÖ®Â∏´ÈÉé)) and had another general, Sang Hongzhi (Ê°ëÂºòÂøó) the military governor of Wuding Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆö, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) attack him. Sang quickly defeated and captured Quan, delivering him back to the capital Chengdu, but Wang Yan then released Quan. (Neither Quan's crimes nor the reason why Quan was then released was stated in historical records.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 920, there was an incident when Wang Yan went to offer sacrifices at the imperial temple dedicated to his father Wang Jian; he had the ladies from the palace, as well as the officials, offer food sacrifices and dedicate music that were not in accordance with Confucian regulations. When the sheriff Zhang Shiqiao (ÂºµÂ£´Âñ¨) urged him to follow proper regulations, Wang Yan became so angry that he almost put Zhang to death, only relenting when Empress Dowager Xu interceded. (Zhang was still exiled and committed suicide on the way to exile.) Later in 920, during a campaign against Qi, Wang Yan decided to personally, with much fanfare, head to the frontline, despite contrary urging by official Duan Rong (ÊÆµËûç). After reaching the frontline, he then returned to Chengdu, leaving the campaign to the generals. It was said that this tour much drained the resources of the prefectures that he went through. There was also an incident where a beautiful lady, the daughter of one He Kang (‰ΩïÂ∫∑) of Lang Prefecture (Èñ¨Â∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan) was ready to be married. Wang Yan seized her, giving silk to her would-be husband as compensation, but the would-be husband became so saddened that he died. Similarly, in 921, he seized the daughter of army officer Wang Chenggang (ÁéãÊâøÁ∂±), and when Wang Chenggang asked for her back, he exiled Wang Chenggang. (Wang Chenggang's daughter, upon hearing this, committed suicide.) Over the years, Wang Yan had never favored Empress Gao. In 921, while he was particularly favoring Consort Wei, he sent Empress Gao back to the house of her father Gao Zhiyan (È´òÁü•Ë®Ä), effectively divorcing her. In shock, Gao stopped eating and died shortly after. (Consort Wei was actually a niece of Empress Dowager Xu's and originally named Xu, but as Wang Yan did not want it be known that he took his cousin as a consort, he falsely claimed that she was the granddaughter of the Tang chancellor Wei Zhaodu.) (Despite his favor for Consort Wei, she did not become empress; rather, he created another consort, Jin Feishan, empress.) He continued to much enjoy touring, and put up tents wherever he went to hide himself so that the people could not see him. Further, as he liked wearing a kind of large hat such that one could tell where he was by the hat, he ordered the men of the realm to all start wearing the hat.  Late reign  Over the years, Wang Yan became accustomed to spend time in feasting, talking, and singing with Pan Zaiying, as well as the officials Han Zhao (ÈüìÊò≠) and Gu Zaixun (È°ßÂú®Áè£). This allowed Song Guangsi to make the key decisions in Wang Yan's name. While there were officials who submitted petitions urging him to change his behavior, he did not do so (although he also did not, as Pan suggested, punish the officials). His cousin Wang Zongshou (ÁéãÂÆóÂ£Ω) the Prince of Jia also tried to get him to change his ways, to no avail.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. In 923, Later Liang was destroyed by its archrival to the north, Later Tang. When Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong sent the news of Later Liang's destruction to Former Shu, the state was in much shock, but took no further action. When a comet (then considered a sign of impending disaster) subsequently appeared and the imperial astronomer indicated that a disaster was coming, Wang Yan established a field for offering prayer to the gods to try to stop the disaster. When the official Zhang Yun (ÂºµÈõ≤) argued that the more appropriate actions to take would be to make policy changes to appease the people, Wang Yan, in anger, exiled Zhang, and Zhang died on the way to exile. Later Tang, while apparently in peace with Former Shu, was then planning an eventual invasion, which was also encouraged by the former Later Liang general Gao Jixing the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), who had surrendered to Later Tang. In 924, Emperor Zhuangzong sent the emissary Li Yan (ÊùéÂö¥) to Former Shu, to observe the status of the Former Shu state. While at Former Shu, Li was making statements that glorified the Later Tang emperor that the Former Shu officials, including Wang Yan's adoptive brother Wang Zongchou (ÁéãÂÆóÂÑî), found offensive, and asked for Li to be arrested and executed, but Wang Yan did not agree. However, he commissioned Song Guangsi's brother Song Guangbao (ÂÆãÂÖâËëÜ) (at Song Guangbao's request) as the military governor of Wude Circuit (Ê≠¶Âæ∑, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), to prepare the troops at Wude for a possible Later Tang evasion.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Li returned to Later Tang's capital Luoyang later in the year. Part of his mission was to exchange Later Tang horses for Former Shu jewels, but that part of the mission was unsuccessful, as Former Shu laws prohibited the shipping of jewels to Later Tang, except for lower quality jewels that were referred to as \\"items to send into the wild\\" (ÂÖ•ËçâÁâ©, rucaowu). In displeasure, Emperor Zhuangzong stated, \\"How would Wang Yan know that he would not be a 'person to send into the wild'?\\" Li used this opportunity to further point out to Emperor Zhuangzong that Wang Yan was not personally handling the affairs of state and that Wang Zongbi and Song Guangsi, as well as other powerful officials, were corrupt, such that Former Shu should easily be conquerable. Wang Yan was not completely oblivious to the possible Later Tang attack, as later in 924, he commissioned his adoptive brother Wang Zong'e (ÁéãÂÆóÈçî) as the commander at a task force, placed at Yang Prefecture (Ê¥ãÂ∑û, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), and the general Lin Si'e (ÊûóÊÄùË´§) to be the military governor of Zhaowu Circuit (Êò≠Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), to increase the preparedness. Meanwhile, Wang Zongchou, seeing that Wang Yan was not capable of ruling, discussed with Wang Zongbi the possibility of deposing Wang Yan, but Wang Zongbi hesitated. In anger and fear, Wang Zongchou died later in 924. Around this time, Wang Yan also alienated the general by putting the eunuch Wang Chengxiu (ÁéãÊâø‰ºë) in command of the elite Longwu Army (ÈæçÊ≠¶Ëªç). Further, by the end of 924, believing that there would be peace between Former Shu and Later Tang (as the states have further sent emissaries to each other), Wang Yan began to cut back on some of the army deployments that he had ordered. In addition, at Wang Chengxiu's request, he commissioned Wang Chengxiu as the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu), sending the Longwu Army to serve as Wang Chengxiu's personal army. (Wang Chengxiu had gotten Wang Yan's agreement to this proposal by telling Wang Yan that Tianxiong's capital Qin Prefecture (Áß¶Â∑û) was known for beautiful women and that he would collect them for the emperor.) He also made his uncle Xu Yanqiong (ÂæêÂª∂Áìä) the commander of the imperial guards, replacing Wang Zongbi, against the words left by Wang Jian. By fall 925, Later Tang was deep in the preparation of an invasion of Former Shu, and Emperor Zhuangzong commissioned his son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei to serve as titular commander of the operations while making the major general Guo Chongtao Li Jiji's deputy, in actual command of the operations. Around the same time, Wang Yan, oblivious to the impending invasion, was still touring the realm with his mother and aunt, including to such places as Mount Qincheng, Peng Prefecture (ÂΩ≠Â∑û, in modern Chengdu), and Han Prefecture (in modern Deyang, Sichuan). Further, at Wang Chengxiu's urging, he made plans to visit Qin Prefecture, partly because he wanted to see Wang Chengxiu's wife Lady Yan, with whom he was having an affair. He paid no heed to advice to the contrary, including urging by Wang Zongbi and even Empress Dowager Xu not to undertake the trip. When he reached Han Prefecture, news came from the Wang Chengjie (ÁéãÊâøÊç∑) the military governor of Wuxing Circuit (Ê≠¶Ëàà, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) that Later Tang had launched from an invasion, but Wang Yan believed this to be false report to dissuade him from the Qin trip, and therefore paid no heed. Only after, when he reached Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, Zhaowu's capital) and fleeing soldiers from Wuxing (where Wang Chengjie had surrendered by this point) arrived there as well did he believe that there was an actual Later Tang invasion. At Wang Zongbi's and Song Guangsi's advice, he stayed at Li and sent the generals Wang Zongxun (ÁéãÂÆóÂã≥), Wang Zongyan (ÁéãÂÆóÂÑº), and Wang Zongyu (ÁéãÂÆóÊò±) to command the main Former Shu army to resist. However, they were crushed by the Later Tang forward commander Li Shaochen. Hearing of their defeat, in fear, Wang Yan fled back to Chengdu and put Wang Zongbi in charge at Li Prefecture; he also ordered Wang Zongbi to execute Wang Zongxun, Wang Zongyan, and Wang Zongyu. Meanwhile, other Former Shu generals surrendered or were defeated in droves by the Later Tang forces; this included Song Guangbao (who surrendered Wude Circuit) and Wang Chengxiu (who tried to launch his own forces to cut off the Later Tang army, but lost much of his troops as casualties against Qiang tribal forces, which stopped him from retreating), such that of his initial, 12,000-men army, only 2,000 survived. Meanwhile, when Wang Zongxun, Wang Zongyan, and Wang Zongyu retreated to Li Prefecture, instead of executing them, Wang Zongbi showed them the order and planned with them to surrender to Later Tang together. Wang Zongbi marched his army back to Chengdu and seized the palace, putting the imperial household, including Wang Yan and Empress Dowager Xu, under effective house arrest, while seizing the imperial treasury. He sent letters to Li Jiji and Guo, offering to surrender, and also a letter in Wang Yan's name to Li Yan, offering to surrender as soon as Li Yan arrived. Li Yan thus went to Chengdu, where Wang Yan met Li Yan and entrusted his mother and wife to Li Yan. Wang Zongbi took the opportunity to also carry out a general purge of officials that he had long despised, while claiming that both he and Wang Yan had long wanted to submit but were stopped by these officials. When the main Later Tang forces under Li Jiji arrived at Chengdu, Wang Yan formally surrendered.  After surrender to Later Tang  Emperor Zhuangzong initially tried to appear lenient, sending an edict addressed to Wang Yan, stating: In spring 926, Li Jiji sent Wang Yan and his household, as well as a large group of Former Shu officials, from Chengdu, on a journey to the Later Tang capital Luoyang, to formally surrender themselves to Emperor Zhuangzong. By the time that Wang Yan reached Chang'an, however, the Later Tang realm had begun to fall into disorder due to mutinies, spurred by a famine at that time, as well as Emperor Zhuangzong's unjustified killing of the major generals Guo Chongtao and Zhu Youqian earlier in the year. Emperor Zhuangzong ordered Wang Yan to stay at Chang'an to wait for the situation to clear. As the mutinies multiplied, Emperor Zhuangzong's favorite actor Jing Jin (ÊôØÈÄ≤) suggested to Emperor Zhuangzong that given the size of Wang Yan's train of imperial household members and officials, they might pose a threat for mutiny as well, and therefore called for Wang Yan's death. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed and sent the eunuch Xiang Yansi (ÂêëÂª∂Âó£) to do so, initially decreeing that Wang Yan's entire train be executed. However, Emperor Zhuangzong's chief of staff, Zhang Juhan reviewed the edict and changed the edict to state that Wang Yan's entire family be executed, sparing over 1,000 of the Former Shu officials and palace servants. Wang Yan and his family were executed that It was said that as Empress Dowager Xu was to be executed, she cried out in cursing Emperor Zhuangzong, \\"My son surrendered an empire to you but could not avoid having his clan slaughtered. You abandoned your faith and your righteousness, and I know that you will soon suffer disaster as well!\\" (Her curse came true, as mutineers supporting Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan would rise at Luoyang shortly after, killing Emperor Zhuangzong in battle.) By 928, at which time Li Siyuan was emperor (as Emperor Mingzong), Wang Zongshou, who was then a military commander at Later Tang's Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) requested permission to try to locate Wang Yan's body and bury it properly. Emperor Mingzong agreed, and also posthumously created Wang Yan the Duke of Shunzheng, ordering that he be buried with ceremony due a prince.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Wang Zongshou located Wang Yan's and the bodies of 17 other members of the imperial household, and buried them properly.

She was famous for being a non-Chinese woman who was an accomplished poet in the Chinese language. Her brother Li Xun ÊùéÁè£ was a poet and pharmacist at the court who wrote book in Chinese on drugs. Her grandfather was Li Su-sha. Her family fled Huang Chao's rebellion to the land of Shu. The \\"Tang poems\\" contained the work of Li Shunxian. Li Shunxian and Li Xun were both known for their poetry. The Chinese queen held the only higher rank than what the Persian Li Shunxian held as consort and since their husband Wang Yang was born in 899 and he became Emperor in 919 when he was 20 years old and reigned to 924 Li Shunxian is speculated to have at least been the same age of him at 20 years old. 880 was the year Emperor Xizong and her family came to Sichuan. Their family is speculated to have been Zoroastrian due to a line in a poem by Li Shunxian where she mentioned a \\"golden bullet for a catapult\\" which Veshparkar, an Iranian god was known to deploy. This was put forward by Li Guotao however other scholars do not believe they were Zoroastians. Luo Xianglin and Chen Ming believe it was more likely this Persian family were Nestorian Christians because in China they were known for their medicine however there is no proof for this either. The Ten thousand Quartrians of the Tang ‰∏áÈ¶ñÂîê‰∫∫Áµ∂Âè• collected by Hongmai Ê¥™ÈÇÅ contains 3 poems in Chinese by her. In the medieval era she is the single non-Chinese woman who composed literature in Chinese.

The 2007 Constitution was the fourth written constitution of the British Virgin Islands, and superseded the 1976 constitution.Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order, 1976 (SI No 2145 of 1976). In addition to the constitution itself a number of the constitutional powers of the British Virgin Islands government are specified a \\"letter of entrustment\\" from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which delegates powers to the British Virgin Islands government to represent itself in certain external affairs.As the British Virgin Islands is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, absent such delegation then all external affairs of the British Virgin Islands would be conducted by the United Kingdom through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The 2007 Constitution was adopted as part of a wider consultation between the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. Accordingly, the Constitution is in substantially similar form to the constitutions of a number of other British dependent territories. The Constitution came into force immediately following the dissolution of the old Legislative Council prior to the 2007 general election. The new constitution adopted new nomenclature: the Chief Minister was renamed the Premier, the Executive Council was renamed Cabinet and the Legislative Council was renamed the House of Assembly. The Constitution is framed on the classic \\"separation of powers\\" precept, although as with other Westminster system constitutions, there is a blurring of the distinctions between legislature and executive. Constitutional history The British Virgin Islands has had four written constitutions during its modern history. Although prior to 1954 various constitutional arrangements were made for the Territory in relation to its former colonial legislatures and executive councils, there are few direct records remaining in relation to those provisions. From 1901, when the original Legislative Council was formally dissolved,Constitution (Virgin Islands) Act, 1902. until 1950 the Territory was officially administered as part of the Leeward Islands Federation through the Governor of the Leeward Islands. Following civil unrest in 1947 the Territory was granted its first modern written constitution in 1950,Constitution (Virgin Islands) Act, 1950. although at this time it still remained part of the wider Federal Colony of the Leeward Islands. The main purpose of the 1950 Constitution was to re- devolve power back to the reformed Legislative Council in the British Virgin Islands from the Governor of the Leeward Islands. Historically it is regarded a holding measure. It was famously described by McWelling Todman QC as \\"an instrument minimal in its intent and its effect.\\" Historically it was a part of the process that eventually led to the more fundamental constitutional change. In 1954 the Constitution and Elections Act, 1954 was passed, which provided for universal adult suffrage for the first time in the Territory's history (the 1950 general election had been conducted on the basis of votes of landowners who were able to pass a literacy test - scarcely a representative sample of the population as a whole in 1950). The British Government had hoped that after the Leeward Islands Federation was abolished in 1956 the British Virgin Islands would join the new Federation of the West Indies, but there was little enthusiasm for that, and so eventually the 1967 Constitution was promulgated.Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order, 1967 (SI No 471 of 1967). The 1967 Constitution was eventually replaced by a revised and updated Constitution which came into force on 1 June 1977,Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order, 1976 (SI No 2145 of 1976). and the 1976 Constitution was amended at various points, including in 1994 pursuant to the Elections Act, 1994 to introduce \\"at-large\\" representatives into the legislature. The 1976 constitution was in turn superseded in 2007 by the current form which came into force on 15 June 2007. Framework The constitution provides for a unicameral House of Assembly (legislature) based upon representative democracy and a multi-party system. The head of state is the British Monarch, who is represented in the Territory by the Governor. The Governor appoints as Premier and head of government the leader of the party with the largest number of seats in the House of Assembly. Executive authority is vested in the Cabinet which consists of the Premier, four other Ministers appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier, and the Attorney General, ex officio. Structure and provisions Recitals Prior to the commencement of Chapter I (but after the legal boilerplate Article 1) the Constitution contains a number of recitals relating to the heritage of the British Virgin Islands, which includes a professed national belief in God. The second paragraphs of the recitals contains the words: The recitals also contain an express statement: \\"the people of the territory of the Virgin Islands have over centuries evolved with a distinct cultural identity which is the essence of a Virgin Islander\\". This operates as a preludes to various provisions in the Constitution which reserve specific rights of privileges to Belongers. The remainder of the recitals are more generic and common in form to the constitutions of other British Overseas Territories, including \\"respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and the rule of law\\", the \\"quest for social justice, economic empowerment and political advancement\\", governance based upon \\"based on adherence to well-established democratic principles and institutions\\" and \\"[a] country based on qualities of honesty, integrity, mutual respect, [and] self-reliance\\". Chapter I: Interpretation The first chapter of the Constitution simply sets out a number of defined terms and generally applicable principles. This includes the definition of \\"belonger status\\" under British Virgin Islands law. Chapter II: Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual The second chapter, which is made up of articles 9‚Äì34, lays out the fundamental rights and freedoms of those in the British Virgin Islands. The wording is broadly taken from documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, although there is a greater emphasis on the right of self- determination. Chapter II expressly reserves the right to the British Virgin Islands Government to legislate in a way which is prejudicial to non- belongers.Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 26(4). Article 27 permits the governor to declare a \\"state of emergency\\". The only time this power has ever been exercised was after Hurricane Irma in 2017. However the declaration is required to be either posted in the Gazette or announced on radio ‚Äì because of the devastation caused by the hurricane neither of those was possible. Accordingly the declaration had to be \\"posted in public places\\". Chapter III: The Governor The third chapter, which is made up of articles 35-45, states that there shall be a Governor of the British Virgin Islands and describes the appointment process for that office. The chapter also sets out how the duties and powers of the Governor are determined, making reference to the role of the Queen through her Secretary of State. Article 37 of the chapter describes the times when an Acting Governor is required and the appointment process for that position. Chapter IV: The Executive The fourth chapter, which is made up of articles 46-61, sets out the structure and composition of the Executive. Article 46 provides that executive authority is vested in the British Monarch, and exercised through the Governor. The remainder of the Chapter sets out the appointment of Cabinet, which is constituted by the Premier, four other Ministers, and the Attorney General ex officio. The Premier is appointed by the Governor as the head of the largest party in the House of Assembly. Other Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier. Chapter V: The Legislature The fifth chapter, which is made up of articles 62-88, sets out the regulation and procedures of the House of Assembly, giving the House of Assembly the power to make laws, describing the sittings, voting and the quorum of the House of Assembly, as well as detailing the role and election of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. The House of Assembly is unicameral. The Governor has reserve powers to disallow laws passed by the House of Assembly and (in an emergency) to declare laws to have been passed in accordance with the constitution.Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, articles 80 and 81. The Chapter sets out both the qualifications and disqualifications for elected membership. It also confirms that the Governor, acting on advice of the Premier, has power to prorogue and dissolve the House of Assembly. The House of Assembly must be dissolved within four years of first sitting, and fresh general elections held.Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 84(3). General elections must be held within two months, but not earlier than 21 days, after dissolution.Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 86. The Constitution does not make express provision for privileges and immunities of the House of Assembly, but permits the Legislature to make laws to determine the same, provided always that such laws do not exceed the position in relation to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 82. Chapter VI: The Judiciary The sixth chapter, which is made up of articles 89 and 90, sets out the provisions relating to the judiciary. This simply provides for the continuing authority of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in the British Virgin Islands. Chapter VII: The Public Service The seventh chapter, which is made up of articles 91-101, specifies that there shall be a Public Service Commission, a Teaching Service Commission, a Judicial and Legal Services Commission and a Police Service Commission. The power to appoint, remove and exercise disciplinary control over the public offices judiciary, the police force is vested in the Governor who shall ordinarily exercise that power on the advice of the relevant Commission (there is no equivalent power for teaching posts). Chapter VIII: Finance The eighth chapter, which is made up of articles 102-109, regulates the powers of the Government of the British Virgin Islands over the public finances. The chapter provides for the Consolidated Fund for the storage of public funds, and article 104 regulates the authorisation of expenditure. Article 106 creates a Contingencies Fund, to be used in the event of an urgent and unforeseen need for expenditure. Use of the fund requires the approval of the House of an Assembly by way of an appropriation Bill. Chapter IX: Complaints Commissioner The ninth chapter, which is made up of articles 110-112, sets out the procedure for the appointment of a Complaints Commissioner and describes its process and function. The first Complaints Commissioner was the former Deputy Governor, Mr Elton Georges. In May 2015 he was replaced by Sheila Brathwaite. The Complaints Commissioner appears to be the least well functioning part of the Constitution; although Complaints are reported and then investigated, the usual outcome is that the relevant Government department simply ignores the findings.; Chapter X: Miscellaneous The tenth and final chapter, which is made up of articles 113-119, deals principally with revocations and the continuing validity of existing laws and offices and officers. Article 119, the final article, provides: Public offices The Constitution provides for various public offices in the British Virgin Islands. These include: * GovernorVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 35(1). * Deputy GovernorVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 36(1). * PremierVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 52(1). * Ministers of GovernmentVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 52(2). * Cabinet SecretaryVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 51(1)(b). * Attorney GeneralVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 58(1). * Director of Public ProsecutionsVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 59(1). * Speaker of the House of AssemblyVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 69(1). * Deputy Speaker of the House of AssemblyVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 69(4). * Leader of the OppositionVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 70(1). * Auditor GeneralVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 109. * Complaints CommissionerVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 110. Commissions, councils and committees The Constitution also provides for various public commissions and committees. These include: * a human rights commissionVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 34(1). * an advisory committee on the prerogative of mercyVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 44(1). * a National Security CouncilVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 57(1). * a Public Service CommissionVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 91(1). * a Teaching Service CommissionVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 93. * a Judicial and Legal Services CommissionVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 86. * a Police Services CommissionVirgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 96. Amendments The 2007 constitution has never been amended (although previous constitutions had beenThe 1976 Constitution was amended five times pursuant to the Virgin Islands (Constitution) (Amendment) Order, 1979; the Virgin Islands (Constitution) (Amendment) Order, 1982; the Virgin Islands (Constitution) (Amendment) Order, 1991; the Virgin Islands (Constitution) (Amendment) Order, 1994 and the Virgin Islands (Constitution) (Amendment) Order, 2000.), nor have any of the letters delegating authority to the Territory to manage its external affairs. However in 2010 the Premier at the time, Ralph O'Neal, publicly stated that the constitution may soon have to be amended to delegate further powers to the Territory from the United Kingdom. In 2016 the subsequent Premier, Orlando Smith, also called for further constitutional review. External Affairs Under the Constitution the Governor is given responsibility for all external affairs,Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 60(1). and in practice this power is exercised by or under the direction of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. However, the Constitution also provides that this power is then to be delegated by the Governor either to the Premier or a Minister of Government in relation to a number of specific areas:Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 60(4). # the Caribbean Community, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Association of Caribbean States, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, or any other Caribbean regional organisation or institution; # other Caribbean regional affairs relating specifically to issues that are of interest to or affect the Virgin Islands; # the relationship between the British Virgin Islands and the United States Virgin Islands in matters of mutual interest; # tourism and tourism-related matters; # taxation and the regulation of finance and financial services; and # European Union matters directly affecting the interests of the British Virgin Islands. Pursuant to a \\"letter of entrustment\\" dated 13 June 2007 the British Government has devolved wide discretion to the Government of the Territory to manage its own external affairs, and adds that the British Government would give \\"sympathetic consideration\\" for requests to take action on other matters. Constitutional challenges In the comparatively brief history of the 2007 constitution, there has only been one legal challenge brought against it to date. In 2012 two police officers brought proceedings against the Acting Chief of Police, David Morris, and the Governor, Boyd McCleary, alleging that the Police Service (Delegation of Powers) Regulations, 2012 were unlawful under article 97(5) of the Constitution. Their claim eventually failed.

On 11 October 2012, it was announced that Foxtel had acquired \\"certain assets\\" from the Premium Movie Partnership (PMP) shareholders, taking over managing and producing the Showtime channels from 31 October 2012. Foxtel were in negotiations with Movie Network to acquire it, but it was believed that two of the Movie Network shareholders (Warner Bros. & Village Roadshow) broke ranks and began negotiations with Foxtel for their movie rights. On 6 December 2012, it was announced that Movie Network would fold on 1 January 2013, being not permitted to sell the company to Foxtel or renew their contract. On 9 December 2012, Foxtel announced they would launch a new line up of channels branded Foxtel Movies. The channels would offer films from four major film companies ‚Äì 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, & NBCUniversal (rights acquired from Foxtel's acquisition of Showtime). On 20 December 2012, Foxtel announced a movie deal with Village Roadshow. On 21 December 2012, Foxtel announced a movie deal with Warner Bros.. Over 600 posts were made on Foxtel's Facebook page within 3 days after Foxtel Movies' launch, all criticising Foxtel's changes in that the total amount of channels was reduced from 15 to 11 yet the price remained the same. On 17 January 2013, in response to the outrage by subscribers, Foxtel launched an additional 2 timeshift channels (Family + 2 and Action/Adventure + 2). On 21 February 2013, Foxtel announced they had finalised agreements with The Walt Disney Company and MGM, resulting in Foxtel having agreements with all the major studios and distributors. On 15 October 2013, it was announced that Foxtel had reached distribution agreements with StudioCanal, Hopscotch Entertainment One, Icon, and Transmission Films ‚Äì four of Australia's key independent movie distributors. On 1 January 2014, Action/Adventure, Drama/Romance and Thriller/Crime were renamed Action, Romance and Thriller respectively. Despite these changes, the programming of each channel remained constant. In addition to the name change of three channels, all channels launched new logos and themes. On 10 April 2014, Foxtel Movies launched Foxtel Movies Disney, a channel dedicated to Disney's animated, live action and Pixar films. On 28 March 2015, a timeshift channel for Foxtel Movies Disney launched, coinciding with its first birthday. On 1 July 2016, Foxtel Movies launched Foxtel Movies More, a channel which features a mixture of films which air as themed events, as well as encompassing Foxtel Movies' pop-up channels. On 23 March 2018, Foxtel Movies launched Foxtel Movies Greats, a channel dedicated to the all- time greatest movies ever made. This genre-themed channel fills the void left by the two channels offered by Foxtel Movies predecessors (Showtime's Showtime Greats and Movie Networks' Movie Greats) and the cessation of Foxtel offering TCM in 2016. On 7 November 2019, The Walt Disney Company ended its output agreement with Foxtel Movies. This saw the closure of Foxtel Movies Disney and removal of films from Disney companies such as Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Lucasfilm, and Marvel Studios. Foxtel Movies' output agreement with Disney subsidiary 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) was maintained. These changes occurred as Disney prepared to launch Disney+ in Australia on 19 November 2019. Foxtel Movies replaced Foxtel Movies Disney with Foxtel Movies Kids. Foxtel Movies also made further changes to the suite of channels including: rebranding Foxtel Movies Masterpiece as Foxtel Movies Drama, and Foxtel Movies More as Foxtel Movies Hits; and the launch of Foxtel Movies UltraHD which screens movies in 4K ultra-high-definition. It was originally reported Foxtel Movies would also rebrand Foxtel Movies Greats as Foxtel Movies Masterpiece at this time, however, this did not occur. On 7 November 2019, it was announced Foxtel Movies' parent company Foxtel had entered a new output agreement with NBCUniversal which included premiere subscription television rights for Foxtel Movies from NBCUniversal's subsidiary studios Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation. On 1 September 2020, Foxtel Movies launched a localised version of the Lifetime Movie Network. Channels Foxtel Movies consists of 11 themed channels, all with a HD simulcast.

History Nungambakkam railway station was constructed when the electric suburban railway service was laid between 1928 and 1931. Before 1923, the stretch between Chetpet and Kodambakkam stations was covered by the Nungambakkam Tank. The section was converted to 25 kV AC traction on 15 January 1967. Safety issues Despite being one of the busier railway stations within downtown Chennai, the station lacked many safety factors, including lack of a closed-circuit television camera. The murder of Swathy, a 24-year-old computer engineer who was hacked to death by a then unidentified young man in the station premises on the morning of 24 June 2016 in full daylight, received wide media attention and publicity, leading to the public outcry on the safety levels at all suburban stations.

Completed in 1526, it is situated half a kilometer to the south of Ramkeli, 12 km south from Malda in West Bengal.Ramkeli Baro Shona Masjid of Gour, its ruins can be found in Malda, West Bengal, India, very close to the India-Bangladesh border. A gigantic rectangular structure of brick and stone, this mosque is the largest monument in Gour. Though the name means Twelve Doors, this monument actually has eleven.Place to Visit Malda district Official website. Baroduari Masjid is included in the List of Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal by the Archaeological Survey of India (serial no. N-WB-83). History Mosque is a Holy place for Muslims. It refers to its Arabic name ‚Äì Masjid. A Mosque is a place for worship for all the followers of Islam. Mosques all around the world are well known for the general importance to Muslims as well as for Islamic architecture and representation of Islamic culture. Although Mosque is the place where all the Muslims of the community come together and have their prayers, the Mosque can also be the place of beautiful architecture that is famous all around the world. The construction of Baro Shona Masjid, measuring 50.4 m by 22.8 m, and 12 m. in height, was started by the Sultan of Bengal Alauddin Husain Shah and was completed in 1526 AD by his son Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah. The Indo-Arabic style of architecture and the ornamental stone carvings make Baroduari a special attraction for tourists. Design The mosque is composed of eleven entrances, two buttresses, four corner towers and a spacious courtyard which is almost seventy meters in diameter. The building is faced in plain stone and the doors would originally have been framed by mosaics of glazed colored tiles in floral patterns. The roof was strewn with 44 hemispherical domes, of which 11 on the corridor still remain. These domes were originally gilded, and, hence, gave the mosque its name. From the interior, these domes are arcaded, half in brick and half in stone. It is the largest building still standing in Gaur. This very ancient mosque is also known as Qutub Shahi Mosque. It was built in the honour of saint Nur Qutub-e- Alam, son of Saint Makhdoom Alaul Haque Pandvi, by Makhdum Shaikh, the descendant and fellow of the saint. The mosque was known as Sona Masjid due to its earlier gilded wall surface and crowns of the turrets. The eleven arched entrances of the east fa√ßade open into a long domed verandah formed by wide piers on the east and west sides. The verandah in turn, opens onto a prayer chamber composed of three aisles with eleven bays each. Like the verandah, the prayer chambers, now in ruins was entirely covered with pendentives. In the northwestern corner of the mosque. Traces remain on a large Takht, the mosque is stoned faced, but unlike the earlier stoned faced Choto Sona mosque, the surface is not carved to imitate brickwork, the only ornamentation is a string coursing running across the structure at half its height, majestic and somber, the ornamentation on the aro Shona Masjid stands in contrast to the ornamentally carved brick Jami mosque at Begha, built only three years earlier by the same Sultan. This difference in styles raises interesting questions regarding the sultan's role in the appearance of the architecture he commissioned.Michell, George; The Islamic Heritage Of Bengal; pp. 66. Ornamentation Great golden mosque which is the largest of all the monuments in gaur, having an open square in front of 200 feet diameter, with handsome arched gateways in the middle of three of its sides the sanctuary, a rectangular structure of brick faced with stone is 168 feet long by 76 feet wide, its parapet 20 feet high forming a long shallow curve below which is spaced a series of eleven pointed arches between the octagonal turrets at the angles, its interior contains impressive aisles of arches carried in front of the western wall within which is a mihrab opposite each bay.Brown, Percy; Indian architecture; pp. 40.

Prior to India's independence, the West Bengal government had decided to create a Forest Administration to provide conservation and management for forest flora and fauna and deliver environmental services to those living in and around the forests. The majority of the population in the forest depend on it for various purposes like grazing, firewood, and collecting of sal leaves and seeds and mushrooms, etc. With high human pressure on the forests, some minimum amount of forest degradation is almost unavoidable.

She is a five-time medalist at the World Championships, and is currently ranked no. 19 in the world by the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM). She is also the daughter of Istv√°n Gyenesei, former Minister of Local Government and chairman of the Association for Somogy party. Career Gyenesei started out her sporting career as a triathlete and swimmer, until she began with cross-country skiing at the age of eighteen. She first competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and placed sixty-ninth in the women's 10 km classical cross- country skiing, with a time of 36:43.0. Shortly after the games, Gyenesei announced that she would no longer participate in any winter sporting events. Instead, she decided to focus on and compete for the modern pentathlon, a sport in which she had never done before. In 2007, Gyenesei moved to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in central Hungary to work and train with a large number of top-level athletes, including 2004 Olympic champion Zsuzsanna V√∂r√∂s. She began competing as a modern pentathlete at the national junior and senior championships and had achieved her first title in the team event. The following year, she reached into the international scene by competing at the World Modern Pentathlon Championships in Budapest, where she had won two medals, including gold for the women's team relay. Following her early success from the World Championships, Gyenesei qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, along with V√∂r√∂s, to compete in the women's event. During the competition, Gyenesei struggled to attain a higher position in the early rounds, with deficient scores in pistol shooting and a one-touch √©p√©e fencing. She quickly moved to the top of the rankings, when she finished fourth in freestyle swimming, and eighth in horse riding. In the end, Gyenesei finished the event with cross-country running in twenty-fourth place, for a total score of 5,260 points. In 2009, Gyenesei made her breakthrough season in the international scene, when she won a gold medal for the women's individual event at the Bath International Competition in Bath, England. She also upset Great Britain's Heather Fell to claim the bronze at the UIPM World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which included a newly combined running and shooting segment. At the 2011 World Modern Pentathlon Championships in Moscow, Russia, Gyenesei, together with her teammates Sarolta Kov√°cs and Adrienn T√≥th, displayed a spectacular performance to capture their second title in the women's relay. She also added two more gold medals for team and relay events at the European Championships, making her as one of Hungary's most successful modern pentathletes in its sporting history.

The album consists of slightly different lineup, with Jesper Lungaard (bass) and Ole Jacob Hansen (drums) as backing, and Ivar Antonsen playing the piano, while Doug Raney played guitar on some tracks. In addition, the American jazz star Art Farmer played flugelhorn on some tunes, among them the title track. The result was very successful, and \\"The End of a Tune\\" was certainly a worthy conclusion of a notable jazz career.  Reception  The review by Allmusic awarded the album 3 stars.

Its hydroid form grows as feathery stems resembling seaweed from a basal stolon. It is found in many temperate and cold seas world-wide but is absent from the tropics. Description The sessile colonial stage of Obelia longissima is the most long-lived and the most easily observed of its life stages. The hydroid looks superficially like fronds of seaweed. It has a basal stolon growing in close proximity with the substrate. Out of this grow fragile, flexible stems up to high each with short side branches. As the stolon grows, new branches develop and the older ones are reabsorbed so the colony moves across the substrate. When the availability of food is high, further upright branches develop but when it is low, most growth takes place by way of stolon elongation and branching. The stems have dark-coloured, usually straight internodes between chitinous chambers called hydrothecae which are shaped like small wine-glasses. These protect the polyps. Distribution and habitat Obelia longissima has a wide distribution. It occurs in the Atlantic Ocean as far north as the New Siberian Islands to the north of Siberia and as far south as the South Orkney Islands but is largely absent from the tropics. It is also found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. It is also present in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and is considered native from Alaska to southern California. It is one of the first species to colonise newly submerged surfaces and it can disperse widely because of the long-lasting larval stages and its ability to raft, attached to floating objects. It has wide tolerances of salinity and temperature but growth may not occur at above . It can sometimes be found in rock pools but mostly occurs in the shallow sublittoral zone and has been reported at depths as great as off Patagonia. It grows on hard surfaces such as rocks, boulders, stones, shells, the stipes of kelp, floating objects and man-made structures and is part of the fouling community. Biology The polyps of Obelia longissima resemble tiny sea anemones and have a ring of small tentacles which they spread in the current to intercept passing food items. The tentacles are armed with nematocysts, stinging cells with which they subdue their prey. The central mouth of each polyp connects to a digestive cavity which is continuous throughout the stem. The diet consists of zooplankton, worms, small crustaceans, insect larvae and detritus. Life cycle Obelia longissima has a complex life cycle. New colonies can be formed asexually by breakage of the stolon. Both the broken ends heal rapidly and begin to grow. Vertical stolons may also develop and attach themselves to other surfaces before detaching themselves from the parent colony. Another form of asexual reproduction takes place, possibly in response to stress, when gemmules form as rounded stubby outgrowths from the branches. These become detached and float away and, being adhesive, stick to objects they may encounter and found a new colony. Experimentally, gemmule production has been triggered by a sudden change in temperature of 5 ¬∞C (9 ¬∞F), lack of aeration of the water or an over-abundance of food. Each colony of Obelia longissima is either male or female. Under certain conditions reproductive structures called gonothecae form at junctions of older branches and gonophores develop inside these. Male or female medusae develop inside the gonophores, become detached and drift planktonically with the currents for one to four weeks. When the medusae are mature, gametes are released into the sea. Fertilisation is external and the sperm seems to be chemically attracted to the eggs. The resulting embryos develop into planula larvae which one to three weeks later settle on the seabed. The settlement sites may be selected because of a suitable surface film on the substrate. Metamorphosis of the larvae takes place and new colonies are formed.

Like other members of their subfamily they are large typical ladybirds. They are always shiny and often have bright spots on the elytra. The common African species C. lunata is an important predator of the citrus aphid, Toxoptera, and wheat aphid, while C. vicina has been suggested as a biological control agent for the cowpea aphid. Both the larvae and adults are predatory. Freshly emerged larvae consume unhatched eggs, and eventually have a dappled appearance and 6 tubercles on each abdominal segment. Vulnerable stages in the life of C. sexmaculata, including oviposition, hatching, moulting and pupation have been shown to occur after dark, probably as an adaptation to avoid exposure to natural enemies.

Fashion events Fashion events it sponsors include: * The bi-annual pr√™t weeks for womenswear -India Fashion Week, * A week for men's fashion- India Mens Week, * The annual platform for couture- India Couture Week. In 2006, Montana World of Wearable Art(tm) (WOW) and FDCI collaborated in encouraging Indian participation in the latter's fashion show in New Zealand. The Council also collaborated with Vogue to launch the Vogue Fashion Fund in India in order to promote emerging designers. Through this project, the winner (decided by the selected jury panel) is awarded with a grand cash prize along with a chance to be featured in the India issue of the magazine. Apart from this, the winning talent also gets an opportunity to commercialise his/her brand with a leading retailer, and gain access to fashion platforms like India Fashion Week and a one-year business mentorship with an industry professional. In 2013, FDCI collaborated with the Delhi-based Cotton Council International (CCI) to start a reality show Lets Design to promote the use of cotton in the fashion arena. The winner was awarded a direct entry to India Fashion Week Spring summer edition at the young talent pool to showcase the collection along with a prize money of ten lakhs INR. Charitable initiatives FDCI organises the annual mega-designer sale, offering designer garments at heavy discounts. Five per cent of the sale proceeds from this event goes towards various charities like Divya Chaya Turst in Kolkata, Observation Home, Mumbai, and the relief fund of Gujarat earthquake victims to name a few. In 2003, four designers: Anju Modi, Anjana Bhargava, Puja Duggal and Ameet Sikka tied up with nine artists Jatin Das, Sudip Roy, Niren Sengupta and Jai Zharotia, among them to paint garments ranging from the traditional salwar kameez to trousers and skirts. The result was a novel collection for a charity.

Early life Carter was born in Hereford and represented his county at both football and cricket. He is recorded as making three appearances for Herefordshire County Cricket Club in 1885, against Worcestershire in July and again in August and against MCC in August. Carter was employed as an engraver by the Ordnance Survey and in 1887 he was posted to their offices in Southampton. Speaking in 1999, Carter's daughter-in-law, Nellie Carter, said that Carter was \\"not at all happy\\" about being posted to Southampton and that Carter maintained that the move was arranged by Dr. Russell Bencraft who was medical officer at the Ordnance Survey and the first president of Southampton St. Mary's F.C. Football career In October 1887, he was introduced to Southampton St. Mary's F.C. and asked to play as a full-back. He played at right-back in the club's first appearance in a cup tournament, in the Hampshire Junior Cup against Totton on 26 November 1887. The match was won 1‚Äì0, with \\"Carter's playing at the back (being) a distinctive feature of the game\\". The team went on to defeat Petersfield 10‚Äì0 in the next round, with five goals from A. A. Fry and four from captain C.E. (Ned) Bromley. This was followed by victories over Lymington (4‚Äì0) and Bournemouth Arabs (2‚Äì1) before the final against Southampton Harriers. The first match, played at the County Cricket Ground ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, with St. Mary's taking the replay on 24 March by a 2‚Äì1 margin, thus winning their first trophy. Carter appeared in all six matches in the cup tournament, playing at right-back. In the summer of 1888, Ned Bromley moved to London to study dentistry and Carter was appointed team captain, a position he was to retain for the next six years. As captain, Carter was described as \\"a gentleman and a generous opponent\\". In the third round of the Hampshire Junior Cup, St. Mary's were drawn to play Fordingbridge Turks on 12 January 1889. Carter and three other St. Mary's players had been selected to play for the Hampshire F.A. against Berks & Bucks on the same day. St. Mary's tried to get the match against the Turks re-arranged but the New Forest club refused. Consequently, St. Mary's withdrew their four players from the county match to play in the cup. The \\"Saints\\" won the match (played at the Antelope Ground) 3‚Äì2, earning them a semi-final appearance against Cowes. The first match, played at Northwood Park in Cowes, ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw; the Cowes captain requested extra time but Carter refused, claiming that the team would miss their ferry home from the Isle of Wight. The replay at the County Ground was also drawn, thus requiring a third match. The sides had each scored once by half-time and the scores were level when a shot from M. Warn was caught well behind the line by the Cowes goalkeeper who quickly threw the ball out. After claims and counter-claims from both teams, the referee awarded a goal to St. Mary's. After the match, Cowes lodged a formal written protest with the Hampshire F.A. which was initially rejected but this was overturned after an appeal from Cowes, who claimed that the linesman had stopped the ball with his flag while it was still in play. The third replay, also at the County Ground, was a heated affair watched by a crowd estimated at 7,000 but St. Mary's won 4‚Äì1 to earn their place in the final. This was played at Bar End, Winchester against Christchurch on 6 April and was rather an anti-climax, with St. Mary's winning 3‚Äì0 to retain the trophy. In 1891, St. Mary's had a relatively straightforward passage to the final of the Hampshire Junior Cup, where they defeated Lymington 2‚Äì0. Having won the cup for three consecutive years, the Saints retained the trophy permanently. In the following season, St. Mary's entered the Hampshire Senior Cup for the first time and reached the final against the winners of the two previous years, the Royal Engineers based at Aldershot. In the final, played at the County Ground on 14 March 1891, the Saints took an early lead through Ernie Nicholls before \\"a rare slip\\" from Carter allowed the engineers to equalise. Two second-half goals, from Frank Bromley and Bob Kiddle, saw St. Mary's claim the senior cup for the first time. The success in local cup competitions prompted the club committee to enter a national tournament for the first time ‚Äì in the First Qualifying Round of the FA Cup on 3 October 1891, they played at Warmley near Bristol winning comfortably 4‚Äì1, with Carter scoring his only goal in a competitive match. The draw for the next round was a home match against Reading to be played on 24 October 1891. Two weeks before the tie at the Antelope Ground, the Saints arranged a friendly against the 93rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, after which two members of the Highlanders side, Pte. Jock Fleming and Sgt. Alexander McMillan, were signed by the Saints. The FA Cup 2nd Qualifying match was played at the Antelope Ground on 24 October, and ended in a 7‚Äì0 victory to the \\"Saints\\", in which Private Fleming featured strongly with his aggressive style of play earning him a hat-trick. At the reception after the match, the Reading secretary asked for, and received, an advance of ¬£3 on the share of the gate money. With this he immediately sent a telegram of protest accompanied by the necessary fee of 2 guineas to the Football Association claiming that the Saints had fielded illegally registered players in Fleming and McMillan. The claim was upheld by the F.A., who found that the players had not been registered at least 28 days before the match, and as the Saints had not complied with the requirements of Rule 5 they were thus expelled from the competition. In March 1892, St. Mary's retained the Hampshire Senior Cup, with an easy 5‚Äì0 victory over a Medical Staff team. In the Second Qualifying Round of the 1892‚Äì93 FA Cup, St. Mary's were easily defeated 4‚Äì0 by Maidenhead, for whom three goals were scored by F.W. Janes. St. Mary's promptly signed Janes on professional terms, but the signing was revoked by the Football Association, who judged that he was \\"in no fit condition to realise what he was doing when he signed for Southampton\\". St. Mary's also competed in the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1892‚Äì93, hoping to claim a third consecutive victory. After 2‚Äì0 wins over the Royal Engineers and a side from Portsmouth, they reached the final against local rivals Freemantle. The final was played on 11 March 1893 at the County Ground in front of a substantial crowd who threatened to spill onto the pitch. Freemantle led 1‚Äì0 at half-time before Jack Dollin equalised. With the score 1‚Äì1 and only a few minutes left to play, a Freemantle forward, Horton, was about to score past Ralph Ruffell in the Saints' goal when he was tripped by William Stride. Despite protests from the \\"Saints\\", the referee awarded a penalty to Freemantle, which was converted by Shirley Hawkins, giving Freemantle their first trophy. After the match, Carter protested to the referee that the foul had been committed outside the penalty area, saying that he could point out the exact spot where the offence occurred. The referee, Mr. Royston Bourke, replied: \\"In that case, I suggest you have a tombstone erected over it.\\" In 1893‚Äì94, St. Mary's, by now largely a professional side, were again eliminated from the FA Cup in the qualifying rounds, going out to Reading. Carter damaged a leg in a friendly match in December 1893 thus ending his playing career. With George Marshall now playing at right-back, St. Mary's reached the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup again in March 1894, but were defeated 1‚Äì0 by the Royal Engineers. Carter was unable to fully recover from his leg injury and he retired from playing football in May 1894, thus missing the club's first season in the Southern League. In his seven years with St. Mary's, Carter made six appearances in the FA Cup, scoring once; he also played in the finals of seven local cup tournaments, of which only the 1893 final of the Hampshire Senior Cup ended in defeat. Later career Following his retirement, Carter was presented with a gold watch. He continued to work for the club, and in 1901 he became the manager of the reserve team, continuing in this role until the start of World War I, helping to develop the careers of players such as Fred Harrison, Frank Jefferis and Arthur Dominy. After he stepped down as reserve-team manager, Carter was made a life-member of Southampton Football Club. He was a member of the Southampton Amateur Swimming Club, and represented Hampshire at water polo. He was employed by the Ordnance Survey in Southampton, until he retired in 1927, after 40 years' service.

Despite being released as a single in the U.K., \\"A Song for Jeffrey\\" was the B-side to \\"Love Story\\" in the U.S. It is written in honour of Ian Anderson's friend and future Jethro Tull bassist Jeffrey Hammond. Another version of the song was recorded for play on BBC radio. The song starts off with a bass riff by Glenn Cornick before Ian Anderson's flute comes in. It then becomes a psychedelic blues tune, with guitarist Mick Abrahams playing slide guitar. Despite being similar in style to \\"My Sunday Feeling\\" and \\"Beggar's Farm\\", the instrumental section shows a greater influence of jazz rather than blues. The song was largely praised by music critics. AllMusic's Bruce Eder called it \\"a superb example of commercial psychedelic blues\\" but did not consider it one of the album highlights. George Starostin called it one of the \\"catchiest ditties the band ever did: the interplay between the bloozy guitar and the poppy harmonica is amazing and promptly digs itself into your memory\\". Despite the single not reaching the charts, New Musical Express wrote that it was \\"good enough to have made the Chart\\". \\"A Song for Jeffrey\\" was ranked the 25th best Jethro Tull song by Rock ‚Äì Das Gesamtwerk der gr√∂√üten Rock-Acts im Check. The song was performed on the Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Circus in December 1968, although only Ian Anderson's vocals and flute were actually amplified from the live performance; the rest of the band mimed their parts, but the sound was pre-recorded. This was the only Tull performance with guitarist Tony Iommi during his two-week tenure with the band, and it has been suggested that he had not had time to learn his part and thus relied on Abrahams' recording. This version was officially released on the companion album to the film in 1996.

It was developed by 3Division Entertainment and published by Frogster Interactive. The game was released in April 2006. Gameplay The player controls a plane whose allegiance is one of three World War II nations: UK, USSR, or Nazi Germany. The game ignores factions such as USA, Japan, and Italy. Each nation has several unique fighter planes which are collected and then used during the campaign. The campaign spans the entire course of the war. During the single-player campaign the player earns stats, achievements, new planes, and commendations. The game also comes with multi-player for Internet TCP/IP. Up to 8 players can play at once. All the planes can be chosen and different skins can be added for personal customization. Both Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch are available game styles. The graphics are fairly decent for a 2006 flight game. There is a large variety of multi-player and single-player maps and locations to play in. There is a lack of voice-over in the game and instead focuses on machine sounds and music. The game has several spinoffs, including the recent Air Conflicts: Vietnam in 2014. Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II was released in 2009, Air Conflicts: Secret Wars in 2011, and Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers in 2012, creating a trilogy of Air Conflicts games.

This was the first World's Parliament of Religions and it was held from 11 to 27 September 1893. Delegates from all over the world joined this Parliament. In 2012 a three-day world conference was organized to commemorate 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda.  Background   Journey to the west  With funds collected by his Madras disciples, the kings of Mysore, Ramnad, Khetri, diwans and other followers, Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name \\"Vivekananda\\" which was suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri. The name \\"Vivekananda\\" meant \\"the bliss of discerning wisdom\\". Vivekananda began his journey to America from Bombay, India on 31 May 1893, on the ship named peninsula His journey to America took him to China, Japan and Canada. At Canton (Guangzhou) he saw some Buddhist monasteries. Then he visited Japan. First he went to Nagasaki. He saw three more big cities and then reached Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo and then he reached Yokohama. He started his journey to Canada in a ship named RMS Empress of India from Yokohama . Vivekananda 1893 with The East Indian Group  Meeting with Jamsetji Tata  In the journey from Yokohama to Canada on the ship Empress, Vivekananda accidentally met Jamsetji Tata who was also going to Chicago. Tata, a businessman who made his initial fortune in the opium trade with China and started one of the first textile mills in India, was going to Chicago to get new business ideas. In this accidental meeting on the Empress, Vivekananda inspired Tata to set up a research and educational institution in India. They also discussed a plan to start a steel factory in India. He reached Vancouver on 25 July. From Vancouver (of Canada) he travelled to Chicago by train and arrived there on Sunday, 30 July 1893.  Journey to Boston  After reaching Chicago Vivekananda learned no one could attend the Parliament as delegate without credential or bona fide. He did not have one at that moment and felt utterly disappointed. He also learned the Parliament would not open till first week of September. But Vivekananda did not give up his hope. To cut his expenditure, he decided to go to Boston, which was less costly than Chicago.  Meeting with John Henry Wright  At Boston Vivekananda met Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University. Professor Wright invited Vivekananda to give a lecture at the University. After being acquainted with Vivekananda's knowledge, wisdom and excellence, Professor Wright insisted him to represent Hinduism at the Parliament of World's Religions. Vivekananda himself later wrote‚Äì \\"He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation\\". When Wright learned that Vivekananda was not officially accredited and did not have any credential to join the Parliament, he told Vivekananda‚Äì \\"To ask for your credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine in the heavens.\\"  At the World's Parliament of Religions  Response to Welcome (11 September 1893) The World's Parliament of Religions started on 11 September 1893 at the Permanent Memorial Art Palace (also identified as the World's Congress Auxiliary Building), now the Art Institute of Chicago, as part of the World's Columbian Exposition. Vivekananda gave his first lecture on that day. Towards the afternoon his turn came, after so much of procrastination. Though initially nervous, he bowed to Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning, and he felt he got new energy in his body; he felt someone or something else had occupied his body‚Äì \\"The Soul of India, the echo of the Rishis, the voice of Ramakrishna, the mouthpiece of the resurgent Time spirit\\". Then began his speech with salutation, \\"Sisters and brothers of America!\\". To these words, he got a standing ovation from a crowd of seven thousand, which lasted for two minutes. When silence was restored he began his address. He greeted the youngest of the nations on behalf of \\"the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.!\\" Why we disagree (15 September 1893) Vivekananda at the Parliament of Religions with Virchand Gandhi, Hewivitarne Dharmapala In this speech Vivekananda tried to explain the reason of disagreement between each other and different sects and religions. He told a story of a frog,which is popularly known as (kuor bang). And in the story he told, a frog used to live in a well. It was born there and brought up there and it used to think his well was the biggest water land of the world. One day, a frog from a sea came to that well. When the frog from the sea told the frog of the well that sea is much bigger than that well, the frog of the well did not believe it and drove the frog of the sea away from his well. Vivekananda concluded‚Äì \\"That has been the difficulty all the while. I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little well and thinking that the whole world is my little well. The Christian sits in his little well and thinks the whole world is his well. The Muslim sits in his little well and thinks that is the whole world.\\" Paper on Hinduism (19 September 1893) Vivekananda gave a short introduction of Hinduism and spoke on \\"The meaning of the Hindu religion\\". He also talked about the 3 oldest religions of the world, namely Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Judaism and their survival and the emergence of Christianity. He then went ahead and shared his knowledge of the Vedanta philosophy, the concept of god, soul and body in Hinduism. Religion not the Crying need of India (20 September 1893) In this brief address Vivekananda made a \\"little criticism\\" and told, religion was not the most important need of Indians at that moment. He regretted for sending of Christian missionaries and trying to save the souls of Indians although poverty had been a much more important issue at that time. He then told, his aim was to join the Chicago Parliament of Religions and to seek aid for his impoverished people. Buddhism, the Fulfillment of Hinduism (26 September 1893) In this speech Vivekananda talked on Buddhism. He talked about origin of Buddhism, relation between Buddhism and Brahmanism, Buddhism and Vedas. He concluded \\"Hinduism cannot live without Buddhism, nor Buddhism without Hinduism.\\" and showed how Buddhism is the fulfillment to Hinduism. Address at the Final Session (27 September 1893) This was Vivekananda's final address at the Parliament of World's religion. In his last speech he told that the Parliament had become an accomplished fact. He thanked the \\"noble souls\\" for organizing the Parliament which he felt \\"proved to the world that holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character\\". He finished his speech with appeal \\"Help and not Fight,\\" \\"Assimilation and not Destruction,\\" \\"Harmony and Peace and not Dissension.\\".  Impact   Parliament of the World's Religions (2012)  In 2012, a three-day world conference was organised by the Institute of World Religions (of the Washington Kali Temple), Burtonsville, Maryland, in association with the Council for A Parliament of World Religions, Chicago, Illinois to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda.

Usually consumed during endurance events, the gels are designed to be quickly and easily digested. Other products include energy chews, drink mixes (called \\"brews\\"), brew tablets, and a Roctane Ultra Endurance line that includes an energy drink mix and gel. The company was founded in 1994 by Bill Vaughan, who began creating an energy gel product in 1990. GU is considered the first major distributor of energy gels. The company has grown over time, and in 2011 its corporate headquarters and 50 employees relocated to a larger space in Berkeley's 4th Street shopping district. It is now run by Bill's son, Brian Vaughan, who serves as president. Background and company history Sports energy gels emerged in the United Kingdom in 1986 as a \\"convenient, prewrapped, portable\\" way to deliver carbohydrates during endurance events. Gels have a gooey texture and are sometimes referred to as \\"goo\\" generically. Bill Vaughan, a biophysicist at University of California, Berkeley, began working on an energy gel product in 1990. He established GU Energy Labs in Berkeley, California, in 1994. GU Energy Labs is regarded as the first major distributor of energy gels, supplying products at the Ironman World Championship in 1996. GU is now run by Bill's son, Brian Vaughan, who serves as president. In June 2011, GU moved its corporate operations and 50 employees from a space to one with twice as much floor space. The larger, space, located in Berkeley's 4th Street shopping district, affords the company an increased production capacity, with room for additional growth. GU's 2011 relocation was the first time in five years that all of its employees operated from a single location; previously, the company's operations, shipping, and marketing were executed from multiple buildings throughout Berkeley. GU outsourced its shipping operations to a third party provider, \\"for improved service and response times\\". Products GU Energy Labs produces a variety of performance sports nutrition products, intended to increase the endurance of athletes. Its products include GU Energy Gel, GU Chomps (energy chews), drink mixes (branded as \\"Brews\\"), and a line of Roctane Ultra Endurance products. Their energy gel contains carbohydrates (maltodextrin and fructose), an amino acid blend, electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and, in some flavors, caffeine. Gel packets provide 100 calories and come in a variety of flavors, including blackberry, chocolate, mandarin orange, peppermint stick, raspberry, salted caramel, strawberry banana, triple berry, and vanilla.Flavors: * The energy chews, created in 2009 and based on the gel formula, are made from similar ingredients but also include antioxidants and come in a chewable form. GU produces two brews: the GU Electrolyte Brew Drink (launched in 2001 and formerly known as Guo) and the GU Recovery Brew Drink. The Recovery Brew, designed for consumption following physical activity, was created in 2009 and includes amino acids, antioxidants, carbohydrates, and protein. GU Electrolyte Brew Tablets contain a low-calorie sweetening agent derived from Stevia. GU's Roctane Ultra Endurance line, introduced in 2008, includes an energy gel and a drink mix. The drink formula contains caffeine (in most flavors), beta- Alanine, taurine, and additional amino acids. Compared to GU's original energy gel, servings of Roctane energy gel contains three times more branched-chain amino acids, more electrolytes, and ten times more histidine. Sponsorships The company sponsors numerous triathlon, swimming, biking, runningSponsorship of marathons and other running events: * * * and outdoor athletes in order to promote its products, including the Brazilian team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, USA Triathlon, TriGrandPrix, the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series, and the Leadville Race Series.Leadville Race Series:  In 2012, the company became the first official gel and chew sponsor for Ironman. In 2013, in conjunction with the Challenged Athletes Foundation, GU established the \\"Challenge for Kids\\" campaign to benefit children suffering from amputation maladies, including traumatic limb loss, congenital effects, and \\"disease- state\\" complications. The company created a special edition passionfruit flavor for its Roctane line; profits from the product would allow the purchase of prosthetics, allowing children to regain mobility. GU increased its goal to $100,000, having surpassed its original goal of $50,000. The company has also supported the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, an organization that promotes high school mountain biking.

Upon discovering the youth, the Princess reckoned that this meeting must be fate, and proposed to Ch·ª≠. The king was enraged by his daughter's marriage to a poor commoner.

Ch·ª≠ drove the stick into the ground and used the hat to shield his wife. To their amazement, the stick and the hat transformed into a grand palace with many servants.

In the 1970s most programming was conducted through batch stream processing, where the operating systems of the day, like IBM\`s OS-360, would allow a single program to use all the resources of a large computer, for a limited period of time. Since student programs were only run a few times, possibly only once, after they had been successfully written, and debugged, efficient running of those programs was of relatively little importance, compared with quick compilation and relatively good error messages.

There were originally two platforms to serve the two lines running through the station. In the late 19th century the number of lines were doubled. One platform was changed to an island platform and a further platform constructed, giving a total of four. A footbridge over the lines linked them together. The main station building was a brick built in Itiianate style and was supplemented by a goods shed in the sidings which served the quay.

The campaigns were initiated as a response to the shown disobedience and subsequent staged rebellion by Abbas' formerly most loyal Georgian ghulams, namely Luarsab II of Kartli and Teimuraz I of Kahketi (Tahmuras Khan). After the complete devastation of Tbilisi, the quelling of the uprising, the massacre of up to 100,000 Georgians and the deportation of between 130,000 and 200,000 more to mainland Iran, Kakheti and Kartli were temporarily brought back under the Iranian sway.  Background  In 1606, Abbas had appointed Luarsab II and Teimuraz I (also known as Tahmuras Khan) on the thrones of Safavid vassals Kartli and Kakheti, at the behest of Kartlian nobles and Teimuraz's mother Ketevan; both seemed like malleable youths. However, tensions between Georgia and the Shah rose in 1612 as Teimuraz and Luarsab executed pro-Iranian nobility including the governor of Karabakh. In 1613, when the Shah summoned them to join him on a hunting expedition in Mazandaran, they did not appear as they feared that they would be either imprisoned or killed. In the spring of 1614 war broke out. This event brought an end to the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha.  Invasion  Iranian armies invaded the two territories in March 1614, and the two allied kings subsequently sought refuge in the Ottoman vassal Imeretia. Abbas, as reported by the Safavid court historian Iskander Beg Munshi, was infuriated by what was perceived as the defection of two of his most trusted subjects and gholams. He deported 30,000 Kakhetian peasants to Iran, and appointed a grandson of Alexander II of Imereti to the throne of Kartli, Jesse of Kakheti (also known as \\"IsƒÅ KhƒÅn\\"). Raised up at the court in Isfahan and a Muslim, he was perceived as fully loyal to the Shah. Abbas threatened Imeretia with devastation if they did not give up the fugitive kings; the Imeretian, Mingrelian and Gurian rulers jointly refused his demand. Luarsab, however, surrendered voluntarily to the Shah; Abbas initially treated him well but when he learned that Luarsab and Teimuraz had offered an alliance with the Ottomans he demanded that Luarsab accept Islam. When Luarsab refused, he was thrown in prison. Teimuraz returned to eastern Georgia in 1615, taking advantage of a resurgence in Ottoman- Safavid hostilities, and there he defeated a Safavid force. However, when the Ottoman army postponed its invasion of the Safavids, Abbas was able to briefly send an army back to defeat Teimuraz, and redoubled his invasion after brokering a truce with the Ottomans. The Safavid soldiers met heavy resistance by the citizens of Tbilisi, but Iranian rule was fully restored over eastern Georgia.  Massacres and deportations In a punitive expedition to Kakhetia, Abbas's army then killed perhaps 60-70,000 or 100,000 Georgians, with twice as many more being deported to Iran, removing about two-thirds of the Kakhetian population. More refugees were rounded up in 1617. In 1619 Abbas appointed the loyal Simon II (or Semayun Khan) as a puppet ruler of Kakheti, while placing a series of his own governors to rule over districts where the rebellious inhabitants were mostly located. These deportations marked another stage in the Safavid policy of forcibly resettling huge amounts of Georgians and other ethnic Caucasian groups such as the Circassians and Armenians, to mainland Persia.  Aftermath  Abbas obtained control over eastern Georgia for a time; however the aggrieved Giorgi Saakadze and King Teimuraz led new rebellions in 1625 and 1626 which were more effective at reducing Safavid control of the region.

The purpose of IDEAL is to improve the quality of research in surgery by emphasizing appropriate methods, transparency of data and rigorous reporting of outcomes. To achieve this, the IDEAL framework provides a set of recommendations for improving the evidence base from research at each stage of innovation, as outlined in the seminal paper published in The Lancet in 2009.McCulloch P, Altman DG et al. \\"No surgical innovation without evaluation: the IDEAL recommendations.\\" Lancet. 2009 Sep 26;374(9695):1105-12. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61116-8. The recommendations emphasize evaluating new procedures prospectively, entering patients and studies into registries and databases to capture all incidences of a procedure, and reporting outcomes by established protocols. It is the first and only such framework for evidence-based practice that was established specifically for surgery and interventional procedures.  Background  The IDEAL framework was the result of an expert consensus developed from a series of meetings held at Balliol College, Oxford from 2007-2009. This group was known as the Balliol Collaboration. The purpose of the meetings was to address the challenges unique to establishing the optimal evidence base in surgery, including practical, methodological, and ethical challenges. Attendees to the meeting (the ‚ÄúIDEAL collaboration‚Äù) included experts in evidence-based medicine, including Cochrane Collaboration founder Iain Chalmers, public health expert Muir Gray, statistician and founder of the Centre for Statistics in Medicine in Oxford Doug Altman, clinician-researchers, methodologists, and manufacturers of medical devices.  Framework and recommendations  The five stages of IDEAL, and the recommendations for each stage, are as follows:  Stage 1: Idea  * All new procedures should be reported automatically * An online registry should be established for reporting of procedures * Reports should include adverse events  Stage 2a: Development  * Protocols for prospective development studies should be established * Protocols should include details about patient selection, operative methods and predefined outcomes * A registry for these protocols should be established * The publication of retrospective case series should be avoided * If retrospective case series are to be published, they should include all consecutive patients and adhere to a reporting template such as STROBE  Stage 2b: Exploration  * A prospective research database should be established * Validated methods for evaluating learning curves, such as CUSUM, should be used * Reporting should be more disease-based than procedure-based * Outcome measures should be predefined and include technical, clinical, and patient-reported outcomes  Stage 3: Assessment  * Study design should be a randomized controlled trial, or acceptable alternatives  Stage 4: Long-term study  * Reporting should include only key outcomes and relevant information * When comparing outcomes among different surgeons or interventionalists and institutions, results should be adjusted for the comorbidities of the patient and the learning curve of the surgeon or interventionalist  Proposals  In the original publication in The Lancet, the authors outline a number of proposals for key stakeholders in the generation of surgical evidence. These include journal editors, funders of services and research, regulators, and professional societies.  IDEAL collaboration  The original IDEAL collaboration consists of attendees to the Balliol meetings. Subsequent members include other stakeholders in evidence-based surgery and interventional procedures. The IDEAL collaboration is led by Oxford surgeon- researcher Peter McCulloch.Peter McCulloch ‚Äî Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences  Role in device regulation  While the initial Balliol meetings were intended to address innovations in surgery and interventional procedures, it soon became clear that there were also deficits in the evaluation of medical devices and implants used in such procedures. In December 2011, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration held a public workshop on using the IDEAL framework to help develop high-quality evidence for devices and implants. In September 2012, the FDA published its strategy for improved postmarket surveillance based in part on the discussions from the IDEAL meeting, including the promotion of registries for devices, better assessment of evidence already published, and improved reporting of adverse events. IDEAL collaborators have written several editorials and commentaries in journals such as the British Medical Journal and The Lancet concerning the regulation of devices.McCulloch P. \\"The EU's system for regulating medical devices.\\" BMJ. 2012 Oct 24;345:e7126. doi: 10.1136/bmj.e7126.\\"McCulloch P, Barkun J, Sedrakyan A; IDEAL Collaboration. \\"Implantable device regulation in Europe.\\" Lancet. 2012 Aug 25;380(9843):729. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61405-6.McCulloch P. \\"Wanted: an appropriate evaluation template.\\" BMJ. 2011 Jun 7;342:d3540. doi: 10.1136/bmj.d3540.

They consisted of both clergy and laymen, and filled many of the higher posts of the Church of England of the time. The Phalanx, also called the Clapton sect by analogy with the evangelicals of the Clapham sect, were active reformers within their common theological beliefs, and controlled the British Critic. One of the Phalanx leaders, Henry Handley Norris, was particularly influential in the church appointments made by the Earl of Liverpool. A. B. Webster characterized the group as: The Hackney core The core group of the Hackney Phalanx, which suggested the geographical association with Hackney borough then east of the London conurbation, consisted of Henry Handley Norris, the layman Joshua Watson, and his clerical brother John Watson. They were active in the field of education, aiming to counter the schools set up on the scheme of Joseph Lancaster. Joshua Watson and Norris purchased the British Critic in 1811. They also influenced the founding in 1818 of the Christian Remembrancer, another high-church journal. Norris took on Robert Aspland and William Dealtry in the early controversy over the British and Foreign Bible Society, and projected a separate Bible society for Hackney. The context of Hackney in the first two decades of the 19th century was of an area that as a suburb of London had wealthy families, but also an active nonconformist intellectual and religious life, particularly Unitarians. The Hackney New College and Homerton College contested the ground with the orthodox Anglicans. The Phalanx, among their other activities, built new Anglican churches. Theologically they looked backwards to William Jones of Nayland. Associations The associates of the Phalanx were a much broader group. They included a generation of chaplains to Charles Manners-Sutton, who was a significant patron: Christopher Wordsworth, George D'Oyly, and John Lonsdale, with the high churchmen George Cambridge, Charles Lloyd, and Richard Mant. Francis Warre-Cornish names as sympathisers John Bowles, churchmen in addition to Cambridge and Wordsworth, and the judges John Taylor Coleridge, John Patteson, John Richardson, and Nicholas Conyngham Tindal.

During the First and Second World Wars, many members of the corps commanded battalions and brigades in the New Zealand Expeditionary Forces sent overseas. The corps was disbanded in 1947. Background For much of the 19th century, New Zealand lacked a modern army. By the mid-1880s, following a series of \\"Russian Scares\\", in which it was feared Russia was the most likely military threat to the country, the forerunner to the New Zealand Military Forces, the New Zealand Permanent Force, was established. The Permanent Force numbered no more than a few hundred men at any one time, and New Zealand's local defence needs depended on the militia, known as the Volunteer Force. The Volunteer Force had a number of defects, the first of which was the quality of its men. Although they funded their own equipment and trained on their own time, the equipment was often of low quality and time spent training was insufficient. Officers were elected by their men but generally lacked professional military training, and were often compromised when giving orders to men that elected them to command. Co-operation between the Volunteer Force and the Permanent Force was lacking. By 1905, the constraints of New Zealand society and increasing work commitments began to impact on the number of willing volunteers. The commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces at the time, Major General James Melville Babington, considered the Volunteer Forces to be an inefficient fighting force. Following the Imperial Defence Conference in 1909, it was recognised there was a need for increased military cooperation between the Dominions of the British Empire. Each Dominion was expected to be capable of raising an expeditionary force with units organised along the lines of the British Army. It was quite clearly apparent that the current system, based on the Volunteer Force, would fall well short of what would be required. The passing of a new Defence Act in 1909 saw the introduction of compulsory military training and the replacement of the Volunteer Forces with a Territorial Force. Military Districts were also created, with each district having responsibility for defined areas having a specified number of Territorial Force units. This was expected to considerably increase New Zealand's military capability to around 30,000 men, with 10,000 being able to rapidly mobilise as an expeditionary force in an emergency. Formation and military service Lord Kitchener on horseback at Johnsonville, during his inspection tour of New Zealand, February 1910 In 1910, Lord Kitchener was invited by the New Zealand government to visit and advise on the country's defence arrangements. At the conclusion of his visit he made a number of recommendations, one of which was the establishment of a New Zealand Staff Corps. This corps was to consist of a cadre of regular officers of the New Zealand Permanent Forces which would provide professional guidance and administration of the units of the newly formed Territorial Force. At the time, the New Zealand Permanent Forces had no more than 30 officers. This was insufficient for the needs of the Territorial Force and it was envisaged that the Staff Corps would consist of 100 officers. Some officers of the New Zealand Staff were to be graduates of the Royal Military College in Australia, to which ten cadets were to be sent annually. To make up the numbers, Major General Alexander Godley, the new commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, held a training camp in early 1911. Prospective officers who had applied for the New Zealand Staff Corps were assessed and trained and eventually 41 were selected to join the 22 regular officers. Most joined Territorial units as adjutants, with some as area or military district commanders. During the First World War, many of the officers of the Staff Corps volunteered for and served in key leadership positions in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), often as battalion and brigade commanders. One such officer, Charles Melvill, later rose to be commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces in 1925. However, having Staff Corps officers in command of battalions was not Godley's intention when forming the NZEF in 1914; preference was to be given to Territorial Force officers. The deaths of several members of the corps during the war resulted in the depletion of the Staff Corps following the cessation of hostilities. To fill the gaps, many former Territorial Force officers who had acquitted themselves well with the NZEF during the war were invited to join. Budgetary cuts in 1922 reduced the corps to 75 officers, and the number of staff officers dwindled further to 55 during the 1930s. As in the previous war, many officers of the Staff Corps volunteered for the 2NZEF, serving as battalion and brigade commanders during the Second World War. Disbandment After the war, greater integration between the professional military and the Territorial Force saw the need for the New Zealand Staff Corps diminished. It was disbanded in 1947, and training and administration of the various Territorial units devolved to officers with local units of the New Zealand Military Forces.

The two predominate themes are war and still lifes ‚Äì orchids, roses, lilies in vases. This series deals with the interspace, the limbo, between these two seemingly juxtaposed topics. It is about balancing the beauty of the one with the horrors of the other and finding a way of coping with both.Sabine Moritz, Limbo. Paintings from 2005, Andrew Mummery Gallery, London, 2006 Roses The publication Roses is a collection of 37 drawings created between 2004 and 2009 accompanied by two poems (The Green Windbreaker by Adam Zagajewski and The Sick Rose by William Blake). Through the different usage of the media charcoal, pastels and oil pastels Moritz displays a versatile approach.Sabine Moritz, Roses, Heni Publishing, London, 2010, Lobeda and JENA D√ºsseldorf During a visit to the artist's studio in 2009 the curator of the Serpentine Gallery, London Hans Ulrich Obrist accidentally discovered a large amount of drawings from the early 1990s. These images depict Moritz‚Äô formative years growing up in East Germany (1969‚Äì85). Two years after having started her art studies, she started to process and come to terms with this time period by sketching her recollections of houses, squares and interiors and at times personal experiences from memory. This extensive collection was naturally divided into two halves, the first dealing with Lobeda and the second with Jena.Sabine Moritz, JENA, D√ºsseldorf, Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig, Cologne, 2011, Lobeda consists of over 100 mostly homogenous drawings, which appear to resemble diary entries. Drawn with charcoal and pencil they are large monochrome images highlighting Moritz‚Äô spatial awareness and keen interest in visualising the common, daily elements of life and in doing so giving them new meaning and gravitas.Sabine Moritz, Lobeda, Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig, Cologne, 2010, JENA, D√ºsseldorf is the natural continuation, but also progression of Lobeda. Produced in direct subsequence, this second series has a stronger personal feel about it. Not only did the artist visit the locality of Lobeda after having finished the first series to revitalise her memory, she also engaged herself with photographs and snapshots from family albums and other images, which she felt had a visual relation to her memories. Broadly speaking this series consists of two thematic focus points. On the one hand the images clearly deal with the personal recollections of the artist ranging from her first day at school to the laboratory in which her father worked. On the other hand, more generalised public places are depicted to reflect the general memory and history of East Germany. This finally goes on to include then contemporary scenes for the artist of her D√ºsseldorf surroundings to breach the gap from her past into her present.Sabine Moritz, JENA, D√ºsseldorf, Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig, Cologne, 2011, Lilies and Objects Originally this publication was planned as a collection of Sabine Moritz‚Äô charcoal and oil pastel drawings of flowers. She has returned to this theme time and time again and explains ‚ÄúSometimes I draw to relax or when coming down from completing a painting.‚Äù Sabine Moritz, Lilies and Objects, Heni Publishing, London, 2011, Although she has drawn asters, orchids and roses, it is the lily and its almost architectural nature that pulls her in time and again and has helped her explore different methods.

This on-going body of work show her interest the knick-knacks with which people surround themselves, them being of religious nature or just for decorative purposes.Sabine Moritz, Lilies and Objects, Heni Publishing, London, 2011, Helicopter This publication presents Sabine Moritz's latest work: a collection of drawings and paintings of helicopters created between 2002 and 2013. The Helicopter series has arisen from the artist's interest in the shift in their symbolic meaning. They are based on images of helicopters from newspapers and television that the artist transferred into her own language. The outcome is a series of beautiful drawings and paintings that range from objective depictions of helicopters to more poetic compositions. The works are accompanied by poems by Adam Zagajewski and Friedrich H√∂lderlin, and a text by Hans Ulrich Obrist.Sabine Moritz, Helicopter, Heni Publishing, London, 2014, * Sabine Moritz, Limbo: Paintings from 2005, Andrew Mummery Gallery, London, 2006 (exhibition catalogue) * Sabine Moritz, Roses, Heni Publishing, London, 2010, * Sabine Moritz, Lobeda, Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig, Cologne, 2010, * Sabine Moritz, Jena D√ºsseldorf, Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig, Cologne, 2011, * Sabine Moritz, Lilies and Objects, Heni Publishing, London, 2011, * Sabine Moritz, Limbo 2013, Marian Goodman Gallery, New York, 2013, * Sabine Moritz, Concrete and Dust, Foundation de 11 Lijnen, 2014, * Sabine Moritz, Bilder und Zeichnungen 1991-2013, Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther K√∂nig, 2014, * Sabine Moritz, Lobeda-Ost 1981 (Edition of 100), Nieves, 2014, Zurich * Sabine Moritz, Helicopter, Heni Publishing, London, 2014, Exhibitions (excerpt) 2005: Zementa, group show with Jenny Rosemeyer and Jan Stieding, Felix Ringel Galerie, D√ºsseldorf, Germany 2006: Sabine Moritz: Limbo.

Most of them are octahedrite with medium to coarse taenite-lamella and distinct Widmanst√§tten patterning. The silicate inclusions are composed of low-Ca pyroxene, high-Ca pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, troilite, graphite, different phosphates, meteoric iron and traces of daubr√©elite and chromite. This composition is very similar to the composition of winonaites, and it is therefore argued that the two groups share the same parent body.

Based on the 1955 novel 'The Wounded and the Slain' by David Goodis, it is a psychological thriller set under the sun and heat of the Caribbean. A married couple, she (Sophie Marceau) with a dark secret in her past and he (Claude Brasseur), an author suffering from both writer's block and alcoholism, undergo experiences which strain their relationship to breaking point but in the end, though each will have to live with the consequences, they are reunited. Plot Staying in a luxurious hotel in Port-au-Prince are the beautiful and sensual Lola, aged about 20, and her husband Alan, a pulp writer some thirty years older. Though meant to be starting a new book, he spends much of the time drinking. Frustrated at his behaviour, she starts an affair with a French fellow guest. Drunk in an empty street, Alan is attacked but, defending himself with an empty bottle, leaves his assailant dead. A witness, Th√©ophile, offers to keep quiet for a huge sum in cash, upon which he will return the bottle. Selling her jewels, Lola raises the money and throws the bottle into the sea. Not satisfied that this is the end of the story, Alan confesses to the police, who do not believe him because he can produce no proof of the killing and they have already locked up a suspect. Alan then goes to Th√©ophile to urge him to testify, but the man attacks him and in the ensuing struggle is left nearly dead. The film ends with Alan in hospital and Lola, whose deep bond with him has been renewed, at his bedside.

The arena is the home of the Colorado State University-Pueblo ThunderWolves men's and women's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball programs. The arena is named for Colorado State Senator Vincent Massari who led the college's push to become a four-year university. Senator Massari was instrumental in obtaining funds for a new campus in the Belmont area of Pueblo, moving from the old junior college campus on Orman Avenue. Outside of sports, the arena is perhaps most noted as the site of a 1980 Van Halen concert that provided the backdrop for an enduring urban legend surrounding the band. The band's technical rider stated that concert organizers had to supply a bowl of M&M;'s backstage, with all brown pieces removed. In the wake of the concert, media reports indicated that the band caused $85,000 of damage to the arena after noticing brown M&M;'s. In his autobiography, lead singer David Lee Roth told a different story‚Äîhe admitted to doing $12,000 in damage backstage, but indicated that over $80,000 of damage had been done to the arena's newly installed basketball floor because it could not support the band's extremely heavy staging.

In 1898 he was presented by the dean and chapter of Lincoln to the rectory of Gumley, near Market Harborough, and represented the chapter in convocation. He was a frequent speaker at church congresses. In 1901 he was a select preacher at Oxford, and from 1902 Birkbeck lecturer in Ecclesiastical History at Trinity College, Cambridge. Early in 1903 Carr Glyn, the bishop of Peterborough, made him a residentiary canon of his cathedral; he was installed on 12 February. Overton was for more than 20 years an Honorary Chaplain to the 1st Lincolnshire (Western Division) Artillery, for which he received the Volunteer Officers' Decoration (VD) 3 April 1894. Death and legacy Overton kept one period of residence at Peterborough, but did not live to inhabit his prebendal house. He died at Gumley rectory on 17 September 1903. He was buried in the churchyard of the parish church of Skidbrook near Louth. He was a high churchman and a member of the English Church Union. As memorials of Overton a brass tablet was placed in Epworth parish church by the parishioners, a stained glass window and a reredos in Skidbrook church, and a two-light window in the chapter-house of Lincoln Cathedral. A stained-glass window [13 Nave - North Wall (ix)] in St James' Church, Louth, Lincolnshire has the dedication 'To the glory of God and in memory of John Henry Overton M.A. D.D., Pastor, Scholar and Historian born at Louth 4th Janry 1835, died at Gumley 17 September 1903'. Works In 1878, with his college friend Charles John Abbey, rector of Checkendon, Oxfordshire, he published The English Church in the Eighteenth Century, 2 vols. A second and abridged edition in one volume was published in 1887. He also published: * William Law, Nonjuror and Mystic, 1881. * Life in the English Church, 1660‚Äì1714, 1885. * The Evangelical Revival in the Eighteenth Century in Mandell Creighton's Epochs of Church History, 1886. * Life of Christopher Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln, with Miss Wordsworth, 1888, 1890. * John Hannah, a Clerical Study, 1890. * John Wesley, in the \\"Leaders of Religion\\" series, 1891. * The English Church in the Nineteenth Century, 1894. * The Church in England, 2 vols., in Peter Hempson Ditchfield's \\"National Churches\\", 1897. * The Anglican Revival in the \\"Victorian Era\\" series, 1897. * An edition of William Law's Serious Call in the English Theological Library, 1898. * The Nonjurors, their Lives, &c.;, 1902. * Some Post-Reformation Saints, 1905, posthumous. At his death Overton left unfinished A History of the English Church from the Accession of George I to the End of the Eighteenth Century,‚Äô a volume for the \\"History of the English Church\\" edited by Dean Stephens and William Hunt; the book was edited and completed by the Rev. Frederic Relton in 1906. He contributed memoirs of divines to the Dictionary of National Biography, and wrote for the Dictionary of Hymnology, the Church Quarterly Review, and other periodicals. Family On 17 July 1862 Overton married Marianne Ludlam, daughter of John Allott of Hague Hall, Yorkshire, and rector of Maltby, Lincolnshire; she survived him with one daughter.

Early life  Zeder was born on March 19, 1886. Then his family lived in Bay City, Michigan. Zeder's parents were Rudolph Zeder (from New York) and Matilta Jane Zeder (from Canada). Zeder had 4 brothers and 1 sister. He had little formal schooling at the Bay City public schools and was put to work earning income for the family at the age of 11. His first job was as a helper being a machinist's apprentice for Industrial Works of Bay City (manufacturer of railroad cranes).Fred Zeder, Vice President in Charge of EngineeringThe Encyclopedia of America Business History and Biography (The Automobile Industry 1920-1980), Zeder-Skelton-Breer Engineering by Richard P.

Also at age 12 he had a job in the railroad industry, inspecting the railroad car axles to make sure they were oiled and greased properly.Three Musketeers - ZSB  Mid life  Zeder became a machinist at Michigan Central Railroad in their Motive Power and Train Divisions in his teens. He was still in high school when he started working for the railroad company. After graduating from public high school in 1905 Zeder went to the University of Michigan and worked part-time as a dishwasher and prepared vegetables for a restaurant. He graduated from Michigan in 1909 with the degree of Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering. He was still living at home with his 4 brothers and a sister in 1910 and his trade is recorded in the 1910 U.S. Census as a mechanical engineer.1910 U.S. Federal Census; Census Place: Bay Ward 7, Bay, Michigan; Roll: T624_637; Page: 5A; Enumeration District: 0047; ; FHL microfilm: 1374650.  Career   Allis- Chalmers  In 1909 after graduating from Michigan, Zeder was hired by the Allis-Chalmers Company in West Allis, Wisconsin, near Milwaukee for their apprentice course as an erecting engineer. This is where he met Carl Breer. Allis-Chalmers selected twenty-five of the best students of mechanical engineering from top universities of the United States. Besides Zeder, Carl Breer was such a student. Breer was from Stanford University. Zeder and Breer became close friends in their training at Allis-Chalmers.  Studebaker to Willys  1918 Studebaker Zeder then was hired in 1910 by a power plant in Detroit helping to build it. His next job, later in 1910, was at the E-M-F Company in Detroit taking charge of their engineering laboratory working on car body design, while still a consultant of the Detroit power plant construction project. Studebaker brothers (wagon builders) took over E-M-F. in 1912 to produce Studebaker automobiles. Zeder was first a consulting engineer for them. Later in 1914, at the age of 28, he was promoted as Studebaker's chief engineer.  The Three Musketeers  Studebaker reached their production peak in 1916, however had major financial problems and was about to be bankrupt. Zeder saw this as a weakness in the engineering department and hired two key knowledgeable mechanical engineers, Carl Breer and Owen Skelton, to form a new engineering nucleus. These three engineers were referred to as \\"The Three Musketeers\\" by those who knew them.Men of Chrysler Zeder was the vice president of Studebaker and his main job was that of being in charge of engineering. Breer, because of his analytical skills, was made the director of research laboratories. Skelton was put in charge of design. Zeder originally got acquainted with Breer at Allis-Chalmers where they apprenticed at the same time in 1910 in mechanical engineering. In 1914 Zeder enticed Breer to come over to Studebaker to work with him in their engineering department. Zeder's relationship with Breer was quite close. Breer even married one of Zeder's sisters. Of the three engineers Zeder was considered the \\"front man\\" because of his charismatic personality and advanced engineering talents. Skelton had engineering talents for engines and transmitting its power to the wheels and Breer had technical engineering design abilities.  Chrysler  \\"The Three Musketeers\\" of Studebaker and Willys‚ÄîZeder, Skelton, and Breer‚Äîwere brought by Walter Chrysler over to the nascent Chrysler Corporation and became the heart of its engineering department, which over the next 50 years would earn a reputation in the automotive industry as one of the best such departments at any major manufacturing corporation. The Chrysler cars of the 1920s and 1930s featured many firsts in automobile engineering. For example, Lee Iacocca credited Frederick Zeder, who became Chrysler's chief of engineering, with leading the development of rubber motor mounts.. Iacocca said that Zeder \\"was the first man to figure out how to get the vibrations out of cars. His solution? He mounted their engines on a rubber base.\\"  Later life and honors  In 1933 the Chrysler Graduate School of Engineering Research combined with the Chrysler Institute of Engineering to form one charter. It offered engineering degrees including a doctorate in engineering. Credits were honored by four accredited colleges by 1937 including the University of Michigan. Zeder was the Institute's first president. He received an honorary doctorate of engineering with the first graduation exercises in 1933. Inducted to Automotive Hall of Fame (1998).

James was a shopkeeper selling horse harness and saddlery, and the future automotive engineer worked as a shop apprentice in his youth. Eschewing horses, he graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in mechanical engineering.  Career  From 1905 until 1907, Skelton's first automotive job was with the Pope-Toledo automobile factory in Toledo, Ohio, noted for their cutting-edge gasoline- powered engine technology. Skelton advanced to the design drafting department at Detroit's Packard Motor Car Company. As he gained experience and then expertise, Skelton simultaneously gained the reputation of being a design analyst who understood the entire transmission of a car, and a master specialist in rear axles and gear boxes. Moving to a startup firm, Skelton was a ground-floor partner in design for Benham from 1914 to 1916. Although the Benham automobile failed to sell, its construction appealed to another automaker also interested in streamlined design, Studebaker. The South Bend firm's vice president and chief engineer, Frederick Morrell Zeder, offered Skelton an engineering position. Skelton accepted Studebaker's pay offer of 58 U.S. cents per hour.The Encyclopedia of America Business History and Biography (The Automobile Industry 1920‚Äì1980), Zeder-Skelton-Breer Engineering by Richard P. Scharchburg; p. 503 The money-losing Studebaker needed to produce a speedy design for a new, inexpensive, mass-market automobile that could compete with the two new automobile conglomerates, Ford Motor Company and General Motors. The struggling firm set up a design shop in Newark, and gave a relatively free hand to the shop's three principals, Zeder, Skelton, and Carl Breer. The threesome became known as \\"The Three Musketeers\\" for their pathbreaking design work for the 1918 Studebaker. Pioneer design engineer Skelton's Newark residence, the Robert Treat Hotel, survives.  ZSB Engineering  Locomobile contained a pioneering, reliable six-cylinder engine, partly designed by Skelton. In 1921 Zeder, Skelton, Breer, and several associates left Studebaker to start an independent Newark automobile design-and-engineering firm, \\"ZSB Engineering.\\" The luxury-oriented Daniels Motor Company hired ZSB to design their 1922 V-8, but the high-end car listed for $7,450 (in 1922 dollars), a prohibitive price for that day. Later in 1922, ZSB turned their eyes toward the mass market, hired by Billy Durant on a motor design for the Flint automobile. The ZSB-designed six-cylinder engine with an updraft carburetor was later used on the Locomobile, a luxury automobile built by Durant Motors. Skelton and ZSB in the same year \\"shopped out\\" a conceptual car design, tentatively called the \\"Zeder.\\" ZSB failed to obtain financing to complete the design work as an independent firm, but news of their work reached the ears of an aggressive carmaking executive, Maxwell's Walter Chrysler. This contact proved to be decisive to Skelton's career. Chrysler obtained financing in early 1923 to merge Maxwell, the Detroit-based Chalmers Motor Car Company, and ZSB Engineering. The merged firm's operations were consolidated in Detroit in June 1923, initially under the name of \\"Maxwell- Chalmers.\\"The Encyclopedia of America Business History and Biography (The Automobile Industry 1920-1980), Zeder-Skelton-Breer Engineering by Richard P.

In 1925 Maxwell-Chalmers became the Chrysler Corporation.  Chrysler Corporation  As a chief design engineer for Chrysler, Skelton is credited with leading the development of a rubber engine mount system for cars. Directed to develop ideas to reduce motor vibration, Skelton's team conceptualized more than 1,000 separate ideas; the Chrysler team combined the best concepts into a new system known as \\"floating power.\\" The rubber engine mounts and other components of the system significantly reduced the transmission of engine vibration to the passenger compartment, thus smoothing the ride.The 1931 Plymouth PA: Walter Chrysler's Fistful of Aces This Skelton/Chrysler engineering innovation spread throughout the automobile industry.Popular Science (magazine), March 1932, p. 89 Skelton also led the innovative development of four-wheel hydraulic brakes as a standard feature on Chrysler cars. His work continued to be significant in development of the rear-engine, all-steel-body Chrysler cars developed through the 1930s and into the postwar years, as Chrysler took its place as a full- fledged competitor to Ford and GM. Later life and honors In 1931, Skelton became a vice-president of the newly founded Chrysler Institute of Engineering. It had close ties to the University of Michigan, and awarded degrees in engineering subjects. Skelton became a member of the Chrysler board of directors in 1937. He served as a director until 1954, three years after he retired from his position as an engineer with the company. He died on July 20, 1969, in Palm Beach, Florida.

The Three Musketeers is a nickname given to a team of three famous Studebaker engineers, Frederick Morrell Zeder, Owen Ray Skelton, and Carl Breer. These three men would later become the core engineers that started the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler surrounded himself with the finest engineers available when he started Chrysler Corporation and the Three Musketeers were such people.Chrysler Institute of Engineering  History  The nucleus of the team initially formed when Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company selected twenty-five university graduates of mechanical engineering to go through their two-year apprenticeship course. Zeder and Breer were two such students picked in 1909 and became close friends during the course. Skelton was a design engineer with Packard Motor Car Company as a transmission specialist. Zeder asked Skelton to join him at Studebaker in 1914. Zeder later asked Breer to join the two of them at Studebaker in 1916, which completed the trio. They became the Zeder, Skelton and Breer Engineering (ZSB) group. In 1919 the three moved to Willys-Overland on the invitation of Walter P. Chrysler (Vice President and general manager). Zeder, Breer, and Skelton were compared to the fictional Three Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Chrysler was referred to as d'Artagnan, The Three Musketeers captain and leader. The three engineers went to work on designing a new car with a new engine in 1920 and 1921 in Willys' engineering center in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Chrysler sign 1920 Chrysler in 1919 was working for Willys-Overland in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was making a million dollars a year, an astronomical amount in those days. He invited the three engineers, Zeder, Breer and Skelton, to come over to Willys. The ZSB engineering team moved to Willys and their assignment was to fix engineering problems on the existing Willys 6 cylinder engine car in production and to produce a brand new car design from inside out at the same time. The three engineers determined that the 6 cylinder car was a major redo and obsolete compared to the new car they had just designed. The new Willys car to come out in 1920 was to be called a \\"Chrysler\\" and a colossal sign of incandescent lights spelling this out was built on top of the Willys plant (see photo to right). These plans were halted when the funds set aside for the Chrysler Motors Division of the Willys Corporation Elizabeth plant were discovered to have been depleted by Willys' Toledo branch. Willys was going bankrupt and heading for receivership. Chrysler himself quit his position at Willys in February 1922 in this turmoil of producing the new \\"Chrysler Six\\" automobile. Zeder, Breer and Skelton were embarrassed as they had coaxed a complete skilled team of 15 engineers to Willys with them from Studebaker. Studebaker at that time had a plant in Detroit that was doing financially well. The three men, along with several Willys engineers, set themselves up as a consulting firm in Newark, New Jersey, under the name \\"Zeder Skelton Breer Engineering Company.\\" The Elizabeth plant and the Chrysler Six prototype were sold to William C. Durant in a bankruptcy sale. The plant then built Durant's low priced Star automobile. The Chrysler Six prototype would be made larger, becoming the 1923 Flint automobile, built in Flint, Michigan. 1924 Chrysler designed by famed engineers Zeder, Skelton and Breer Walter Chrysler went to Maxwell automobile, where in 1924 he launched his own version of the Chrysler six-cylinder. The Chrysler car was financially successful and in 1925 the Maxwell car company became the Chrysler Corporation. The \\"lightning flashes\\" on the Chrysler logo were actually Zs, a tribute to Fred Zeder. This logo was used on the first Chrysler automobile built in 1924 and, off and on, for years thereafter. The 1924 Chrysler Six was said to be the first modern automobile. Automobile historian Mark Howell remarks that this car is second only to Ford's Model T Ford for its impact on the automobile industry. He claims this car is the dividing line between the old style car and the \\"modern\\" automobile.The Beginning of it all: The 1924 Chrysler Six Mr. Chrysler's first luxury car was priced at an affordable $1,565.Chrysler history 1920s  References   Bibliography    External links  * Zeder, Skelton and Breer: The Three Musketeers slide show Category:American automotive engineers Category:American founders of automobile manufacturers Category:American automotive pioneers Category:American chief executives in the automobile industry Category:Chrysler executives Category:Studebaker ","title":"The Three Musketeers (Studebaker engineers)"},{"id":"37954574","text":"Balagtas or Bigaa station is one of the stations of the abandoned Northrail line of PNR.

On May 9, 2013, the official Dexter Facebook fanpage posted a behind the scenes photo of a clapper showing that episode 6 of season 8 would be directed by John Dahl.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152831062040271  Episodes   Reception  According to Metacritic, the early response to Season 8 was mostly positive, the first two episodes of the season received a score of 71 out of 100.\\"Dexter: Season 8\\" With a few episodes left in the season, Rolling Stone opined that Dexter is still \\"cleverly written and has a core cast of characters we care for\\", concluding that \\"everyone's favorite serial killer still has some gas left in his tank\\".Neuymer, Scott (August 15, 2013). \\"Has Dexter Gone On Too Long?\\" Rolling Stone However, as the season went on, reception dropped drastically. The post-season reception was extremely negative.

The Atlantic Wire Showtime president David Nevins praised the series finale, defending it against fan backlash by saying: \\"The fundamental design of where they ended Dexter was really well conceived. He had to sacrifice the one person who was closest to him in the world, and he had to leave. That was where it was headed for a very long time.\\" Nevins also said there were never any discussions to kill off Dexter, and they didn't just keep the character alive for a potential spinoff series, which as of January 2014 they were discussing making. In October 2020, it was announced that Dexter would return with a 10-episode limited series starring Michael C. Hall reprising his role with Clyde Phillips as showrunner.

Career After graduating from Chung-Ang University with a degree in Film Studies, Kim Dae-seung first honed his filmmaking skills as a protege of legendary Korean director Im Kwon-taek, working for almost ten years as Im's assistant director on major films such as Seopyeonje (1993), The Taebaek Mountains (1994), and Chunhyang (2000). Kim made his directorial debut with Bungee Jumping of Their Own (2001), a melodrama about homosexuality and reincarnation. Despite its taboo subject, the film was received well by audiences and critics due to Kim's sensitive direction and the acting by leads Lee Byung-hun and Lee Eun-ju. He subsequently directed Blood Rain (2005), a mystery thriller set in the late Joseon Dynasty. The surprise casting of Cha Seung-won (then-known for comedic roles) and newcomer Park Yong-woo paid off, resulting in critical acclaim and an unexpectedly robust box office. Blood Rain received multiple acting and technical nominations from local award- giving bodies, and won Best Film at the Chunsa Film Art Awards, the Baeksang Arts Awards, and the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. Kim's third film was based on the true story of the 1995 collapse of Sampoong Department Store which claimed 502 lives and wounded 937. Traces of Love (2006) explores the painful aftermath of trauma and loss, guilt and memory, against the backdrop of beautiful autumn scenery. The melodrama starred Yoo Ji-tae, Kim Ji-soo and Uhm Ji-won, and was the opening film of the 11th Pusan International Film Festival. In 2011, Kim directed Q&A; as part of If You Were Me 5, an omnibus commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Starring television star Kim Hyun-joo, the short film denounced the collection and control of personal information that leads to sexual harassment in the Korean male-dominated workplace. Kim returned to feature filmmaking in 2012 with the erotic period drama The Concubine starring Jo Yeo-jeong, Kim Dong-wook and Kim Min-joon. The film, which delves into sexual politics and its role in a power struggle within the royal court, was a hit following its early summer release.

In this version, Dandy Dick performs in a circus and loves the owners' daughter. The circus goes to Siam, where Dick unexpectedly receives a high office and marries his sweetheart. The opera premiered at the Avenue Theatre in London on 2 March 1895 and closed on 13 July 1895.Archer, William. \\"Theatrical World of 1893‚Äì1897\\", Walter Scott, Ltd., p. 404 It starred May Yoh√© as Dick Whittington, Ethel Haydon as Alice, and Henry Wright as Larry O'Brannagan. The conductor was Landon Ronald.Sims, George Robert. My Life: Sixty years' recollections of Bohemian London, Eveleigh Nash Company Limited: London, 1917, p. 324 The show was written as a vehicle for Yoh√©, who had starred in Little Christopher Columbus by the same authors, and producer William Greet leased the theatre especially for Dandy Dick Whittington. The piece was originally written as a pantomime but was later changed to an op√©ra bouffe (or comic opera). Unlike in the Dick Whittington legend, there are no rats in the piece. Audiences particularly enjoyed the \\"acrobatic dance\\" of Florence Levey with Henry Wright.Review of Dandy Dick Whittington in The Black and White, 9 March 1895 The critic of The Sketch thought Wright's impersonation of the popular actor and comedian of the day, E. J. Lonnen, was as good as the original. Betraying its early roots as a pantomime, John F. Sheridan played the dame, Lady Fitzwarren.\\"Dandy Dick Whittington\\", The Sketch, 6 March 1895, p. 276 Synopsis ; Act I Dandy Dick Whittington works in Sir Achilles Fitzwarren's circus in London as a circus- rider and has a performing cat that is never let out of its basket. Dick loves the Fitzwarrens' daughter Alice, but Lady Fitzwarren does not find Dick to be an appropriate match for her daughter. Dejected, Dick leaves the circus and asks his acrobat friend, Larry O'Brannagan, what he should do. It turns out, much to Dick's surprise, and through a political expediency, that Larry has been selected as the next King of Siam. The circus and the Fitzwarrens go to Siam, and Dick follows in the H.M.S. Chimpanzee, together with his friend, Captain Fairfax, who loves Lola, known in the circus as the \\"queen of the arena\\". ; Act II Fairfax arrives in Siam in time to represent the British Empire at the ceremony to enthrone the new King, Larry. Larry makes Dick the First Minister of Siam. Dandy Dick is now a suitable match for Alice, and Lady Fitzwarren withdraws her opposition to their marriage. The real King returns, and Larry happily steps down, as he may now wed his Siamese love, Willasee. All ends happily, as Dick and Alice celebrate their marriage.

Small decorator crabs, like this one, are often found wearing snipped-off tips of stinging hydroids on their heads to fend off predators. Hydroids are a life stage for most animals of the class Hydrozoa, small predators related to jellyfish. Some hydroids such as the freshwater Hydra are solitary, with the polyp attached directly to the substrate. When these produce buds, they become detached and grow on as new individuals c. Section through a hydroid The majority of hydroids are colonial. The original polyp is anchored to a solid substrate and forms a bud which remains attached to its parent. This in turn buds and in this way a stem is formed. The arrangement of polyps and the branching of the stem is characteristic of the species. Some species have the polyps budding directly off the stolon which roots the colony. The polyps are connected by epidermis which surrounds a gastrovascular cavity. The epidermis secretes a chitinous skeleton which supports the stem and in some hydroids, the skeleton extends into a cup shape surrounding the polyp. Most of the polyps are gastrozooids or feeding polyps, but some are specialised reproductive structures known as gonozooids. In some species, further specialised zooids are formed.

With social media knowledge work in organizations can be optimized extremely: like a better distribution/sharing and access to knowledge. This will be more and more important, as in today's business world, speed and complexity increase dramatically, while work environments change constantly . Social knowledge management is one of the application areas of social media in a business context next to others like sentiment analysis, social learning or social collaboration.  Definition  Social knowledge management can be defined as applying social media in the knowledge management context to identify, share, document, transfer, develop, use or evaluate knowledge. Another Definition of social Knowledge Management is the management of social knowledge - where the aim is then more economic development - not only individual competitive advantage by companies (based on authors like Lazlo & Lazlo).  Benefits of social Knowledge Management  Benefits are higher user-productivity & performance, when e.g. users can solve problems better & faster. Through crowdsourcing of user generated content organizations can better leverage the collective and hidden knowledge of the organizations stakeholders - and increase organizational learning. On the other hand the Millennials/ Generation Y uses social media as their natural communication & working tools the tools - so to attract & retain talented young employees it is also important to use social media. In regards to knowledge management, social media put the focus on the individual, empowering the user e.g. to search, create & share user generated content easily and thus creates a new momentum for Knowledge Management.  Application scenarios of social Knowledge Management  * Increase knowledge quantity through leveraging user generated content * Use social review methods like ratings, comments to increate the quality of knowledge * Integration of social media tools and applications into organizations business context to improve knowledge access and sharing - and leverage the benefits of social media in all relevant work contexts * Leverage social media concepts to increase motivation to share knowledge, e.g. gamification, communities of practice * Use advanced, self-learning search providing context relevant results * Help to learn on demand and informally using social learning tools Social Knowledge Management can be applied in many organizational processes, like in customer service, employee-supplier collaboration, or in people development & education.

It is the only independent charity concerned with the study of early India, Iran & Central Asia, promoting both scholarly research & popular interest in the area. It has a library of over 25,000 volumes and it organises a range of activities including conferences, public lectures and visiting fellowships. The primary interest of the Trust has been in prehistory, archaeology, art history and ancient languages, but this often extends to more modern topics and other disciplines. The idea of the Ancient India & Iran Trust came to the Founding Trustees (Dr Raymond Allchin, Dr Bridget Allchin, Sir Harold Bailey, Dr Jan van Lohuizen, and Professor Jean van Lohuizen) when they became aware that the Indian sub-continent, together with Iran, Afghanistan & parts of Central Asia, was the 'neglected quarter' of the world in terms of British cultural life. Britain had had a close association with India in particular for over three centuries and had unrivalled resources for the study of its culture, art and history, in the India Office Library, the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum and much more. And yet, in the wake of South Asian independence, there were very few institutions, teaching posts or funds devoted to the promotion of popular or scholarly interest in any of these regions. The Trust was therefore set up to provide a focal point where scholars and members of the public with interests in the cultures of the ancient Indian and Iranian worlds could meet and discuss matters of common interest and use its unique library. Today, the Trust runs a regular series of public lectures, visiting fellowship programmes and a bursary scheme for people wishing to come and use its library and other resources in Cambridge. It also organises and hosts conferences, high-profile lectures and occasional exhibitions, and has produced some publications. In addition, it created and funded the British Archaeological Mission to Pakistan in the 1980s and has provided a base for external research projects such as the AHRC funded Manichean Dictionary Project (1999‚Äì2005) and Bactrian Chronology Project (2004-7). In 2005 the Trust was voted runner up in the Arts, Culture and Heritage category of the Charity Awards. The Trust is based in a large Victorian house at 23 Brooklands Avenue, Cambridge. The house was purchased by the five Founding Trustees in 1981 and became the repositories of their specialised libraries. It was also the home until his death at the age of 96 of the first Chair, the distinguished scholar and linguist, Sir Harold Bailey.

Like most other Karaman beys, Ali Bey was a rival of the rising Ottoman Empire, and the two principalities engaged in chronic wars against one another. Early life His father was Halil Bey. After his brother S√ºleyman ascended to throne he was appointed as the governor of Ermenek. However, after his brother was assassinated in Karaman, he succeeded his brother in 1361. He had family ties to the Ottoman dynasty, for he married Nefise Hatun, Murat I's daughter. War with the neighbours In the 14th century Anatolia was in turmoil. In addition to Karaman beylik there were many other Anatolian beyliks. Ali invaded the territories of neighbouring beyliks; Hamidoƒülu, Eretna and Germiyan. He even tried to raid Kadi Burhanettin's dominions, but without success.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 pp 247-248 First war against the Ottoman Empire Ottoman Sultan Murat was engaged in Rumeli (European section of the empire) and Ali saw his chance to capture Beysehir, an Ottoman fort in 1386. Murat returned to Anatolia and defeated Ali's forces in a location named Frenkyazƒ±sƒ±, near Konya, the capital. According to Professor Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k, the importance of this battle was that it showed the superiority of regular army (janissaries) over tribal forces.Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k: Kurulu≈ü D√∂nemi Osmanlƒ± Sultanlarƒ±,ƒ∞SAM, ƒ∞stanbul, p.99 After Nefise's mediation however, Murat agreed to withdraw on the condition that Bey≈üehir be handed to Ottomans. Second war against the Ottoman Empire After Murat I was killed in the battle of Kosovo in 1389, Ali invaded Ottoman territory for the second time. But in 1390, Beyazƒ±t I, the new sultan, returned to Anatolia and after defeating minor beyliks he began preparing for final assault to Karaman beylik. Two other monarchs in Anatolia, Kadƒ± Burhanettin and S√ºleyman of Candar however, afraid of the rising Ottoman power, formed an alliance against Ottomans. Ottomans once again agreed to lift the siege with the similar conditions as of 1386. Relations with Timur In 1394 the Turco Mongol commander Timur from the present day Uzbekistan, sought alliances in Anatolia and Ali readily accepted the offer. By this alliance, he planned to gain a valuable shelter against the Ottoman Empire and Kadƒ± Burhanettin two powers he most feared. But Timur didn't appear in Anatolia till 1402 and his shelter wasn't effective as Ali expected. Although he tried to raid Burhanettin's territory, Burhanettin struck back. Third war against the Ottoman Empire and death While Beyazƒ±t was engaged in Wallachia (southern Romania) Ali invaded Ottoman territory once more. This time the target was Ankara. He arrested Timurta≈ü Pasha, the beylerbey of Anatolia. In 1398 Beyazƒ±t once again returned to Anatolia, disregarding Ali's peace calls, he captured Konya and had Ali executed. After death All Karaman territory was annexed by the Ottomans and two of his sons Mehmet II and Bengi Ali were jailed. However, few years later following the defeat of Beyazƒ±t by Timur in the battle of Ankara the beylik was restored.

She also participated in the 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War, the first all-winners season in Survivor history, finishing in sixth place. Stapley is a licensed mental health therapist and the only American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists certified sex therapist in the state of Iowa.  Survivor  Philippines Stapley competed on the 25th season of the reality TV series Survivor, Survivor: Philippines. Originally placed on the ill-fated \\"Matsing\\" tribe, she and Malcolm Freberg were the only two castaways remaining when the tribe lost the first four consecutive immunity challenges, voting off Zane Knight, Roxanne \\"Roxy\\" Morris, Angie Layton, and Russell Swan by unanimous votes each time. Afterwards, Freberg was sent to the \\"Tandang\\" tribe while Stapley was sent to the \\"Kalabaw\\" tribe. Kalabaw subsequently lost the next two consecutive challenges, and in the first of these two tribal councils, Stapley received one vote from Sarah Dawson, while everyone else voted out Dawson. When the merge came, Stapley was on the winning team in the first two consecutive team-oriented reward challenges, and otherwise won the first individual immunity challenge right after the merge. She and Freberg managed to ride out the conflict between the members of the two former tribes, since both were perceived as outsiders who had no conflict with anyone else. However, Stapley was almost eliminated at the final seven, when she received the three votes of Jonathan Penner, Abi-Maria Gomes, and Carter Williams. However, Stapley, Freberg, Lisa Whelchel, and Michael Skupin voted for Penner, eliminating him instead. In the final two consecutive tribal councils, Stapley found herself receiving the sole vote of the person who was eliminated, while everyone else voted for said person: Gomes at the final five and Freberg at the final four. Stapley ultimately made it to the final three, alongside Whelchel and Skupin, where all three were mostly grilled by the jury of eight. However, Stapley was occasionally praised for making it to the end as a perceived underdog, surviving the ill-fated Matsing tribe, and the numerous tribal councils she attended. When the time for voting came, Stapley received six votes (all except Williams, who voted for Skupin, and Roberta \\"RC\\" Saint- Amour, who voted for Whelchel), thus winning the title of \\"Sole Survivor\\" and the $1 million prize. As a result of her win, Stapley became the oldest female winner in Survivor history at age 41. She also set a Survivor record for becoming the first (and currently only) person in the history of the show to attend every single Tribal Council in the entire season. In a 2015 interview, host Jeff Probst named Stapley as one of his top ten favorite Survivor winners ever, and one of his top four favorite female winners. Winners at War Stapley would return to compete on the series' 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War, the first all-winners season in Survivor history.Meet the cast of Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved April 3, 2020Jeff Probst shares intel on Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved April 3, 2020 Her most memorable moment in the season came on Day 16 when she single-handedly voted out the self-proclaimed \\"Queen of Survivor\\" Sandra Diaz-Twine, the (then) only two-time winner in Survivor history, by playing two immunity idols, including one Diaz-Twine had given her herself, to negate the votes of all four other players, therefore saving herself from elimination and eliminating Diaz-Twine with a single vote. Her move earned her the name of \\"Queenslayer\\" from other players and the press, and received a lot of praise from critics. She was eventually voted out on Day 36 in a rare Tribal Council situation that saw no vote counted during the first vote due to the use of three immunity idols, resulting in a second vote during which the four other players had to vote out either Stapley or Sarah Lacina, who were the only players without immunity. All four chose to vote out Stapley, who finished in sixth place. Overall, she received 14 votes against her (including negated votes), more than anyone else during the season. As a member of the jury, she voted for Tony Vlachos to win.  Personal life  Stapley is married to Brad Stapley, an engineer, and they have one daughter together. Her mother is a two-time breast cancer survivor.

Early career Born on 18 January 1923, the eldest of three sons of Colonel J A Graham and Constance Mary Carew-Hunt, John Graham was educated at Cheltenham College 1936‚Äì1940 and, during the Second World War, he served with the Isle of Wight Home Guard, before enlisting as a private into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1941. On 21 August 1942, he was commissioned into the 2nd Battalion of that regiment. Graham served with the battalion, which formed part of the 227th Infantry Brigade of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, in North West Europe, where he was wounded during Operation Plunder and mentioned in despatches. Following the war, he served in Palestine during the Palestine Emergency with the 1st Battalion. In late 1948 he was sent to London to learn Czech prior to working in the British Embassy in Prague 1949‚Äì1950. There he clandestinely assessed the Czech Armed Forces activities, including the building of airfields, barracks and the adaptation of the Czech-gauge railway lines to take Russian rolling stock, all at a time of great tension, when a Soviet attack on war-exhausted western Europe was thought by many to be inevitable and imminent. Later he worked in the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in London. He transferred to The Parachute Regiment where was appointed Second-in-Command of the 2nd Battalion and later Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion (1964‚Äì1967). Oman Promoted to Brigadier, he attended an army languages course to learn Arabic before he assumed command of the Sultan's Armed Forces (SAF), in Oman, in 1970. Sultan Said bin Taimur, the Omani absolute ruler, had outlawed almost all aspects of twentieth-century development and relied on British support to maintain the rudimentary functions of the state. In 1962 a dissatisfied tribal leader, Mussalim bin Nafl, formed the Dhofar Liberation Front (DLF) and obtained arms and vehicles from Saudi Arabia, and the country had been in a state of rebellion ever since. Other insurgents in the north of Oman formed another organisation, the National Democratic Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arabian Gulf (NDFLOAG). In June 1970 they attacked two SAF posts at Nizwa and Izki. They were repulsed but the incident convinced many (including the Sultan's British advisers and backers) that intervention was required. On 23 July 1970, Said bin Taimur was deposed. The coup d'√©tat succeeded because the Omani army's chief intelligence officer in the Dhofar, Brigadier John Graham, and Colonel Hugh Oldman, military (later defence) secretary and supreme commander of the army in Muscat, insisted that Said surrender. When Qaboos confronted his father, accompanied by Graham, shots were fired. The Sultan was flown out of Oman by the RAF to Bahrain. On the morning after the Coup, it was Graham who took the minutes of the meeting of Sultan Qaboos' advisory cabinet. For his service, Graham received the Order of Oman in 1972. Later career He became Assistant Chief of Staff, Joint Exercises, Allied Forces Central Europe in 1974 and, following promotion to major-general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Wales in 1976 before retiring in 1978. In retirement After retiring from the army, he became Secretary to the Administrative Trustees of the Chevening Estate; Chairman of the St John Council for Kent of the St John's Ambulance; Honorary Colonel of the Kent Army Cadet Force and of the 203 (Welsh) General Hospital RAMC, as well as assisting the Staff of The Parachute Regiment at the Regimental HQ, Aldershot, before his retirement to Barbados in 1991. In 1991, he retired to Barbados, West Indies. In 1992 he was made a freeman of the City of London. He died in Barbados on 14 December 2012. Family He married Rosemary Elaine Adamson and had two children, Jacqueline ('Pinky'), b September 1957, and Christopher, b July 1959.

Formerly he was a senior official at the United Nations, and former President of The Hague Institute for Global Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. Education Williams was a student at the Sierra Leone Grammar School, and the Lester B. Pearson United World College in British Columbia, Canada, from where he received his International Baccalaureate Diploma. He earned an M.A. (Honors) in English Language and Literature from the University of Edinburgh where he was an avid debater and won the Student Societies Debating Championship in 1980. He also earned a Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (M.A.L.D.) and a PhD in International Relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy where he was the first Annual Commencement Class Speaker. Career From 2008 to 2012, Williams served at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, D.C., first as Vice President of the Center for Conflict Analysis and Prevention, and later as Senior Vice President of the Center for Conflict Management leading its work in major conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt. Prior to joining USIP, Williams served as Director of Strategic Planning for United Nations Secretaries-General Ban Ki-moon and Kofi Annan. From 1994 to 2000 he served in three peacekeeping operations in Macedonia, Haiti, and Bosnia-Herzegovina as Special Assistant to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and Political and Humanitarian Affairs Officer. In January 2013, Williams became the last President of the now dissolved 'The Hague Institute for Global Justice'.  The Hague Institute for Global Justice and allegations of mismanagement  On 1 January 2013 Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president. He was preceded by Professor Willem van Genugten who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. In an article by Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer (4 April 2018), sources argue Williams was interested in the position but stipulated that the title 'international dean' will be replaced by the more authoritative title 'president', this in addition to a high financial compensation for a primarily tax funded non-profit organisation. The Dutch government granted up to 20 million euro's in subsidies to the project. According to staff members, Williams did not prioritize fund raising, accounting firms confirmed this claim. Furthermore, according to a reconstruction by Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant, Williams spent thousands of euros on expensive lunches at the nearby Carlton Ambassador hotel and first class flights since 'cattle class' was not good enough for him. A senior researcher quoted in the article indicates that there were many clashes between employees and Williams. According to the researcher cited, Williams was distancing himself from employees: 'Like it was beneath his dignity to talk to me directly. There was a culture clash. We academics are egalitarian. Though he was very focused on hierarchy and quickly felt criticized.' Other former employees mention a 'hostile work environment', where a 'climate of fear' reigns. According to Anja Mihr, the former head of the Rule of Law Program at the institute: \\"He was not interested in 'boring' studies that gave no prestige. He just did not seem to care.\\"' Former Chairman of the Supervisory Board Dick Benschop characterized the management situation as such: \\"'It is rather an authoritarian man than a cooperative foreman'. 'That was clear to me too. I talked to him about it.\\" ' Reports claim his financial mismanagement eventually led to his departure in December 2016. In 2013, for instance, Williams claimed 10,205.50 Euro for taxi rides, including a short trip of less than a kilometer from his home to the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, which amounted to 321 Euro. On 29 October he took a cab to Groningen costing 722.25 Euro.Irene van der Linde and Tjitske Lingsma, \\"The Death of a White Elephant,\\" International Justice Tribune, 6 April 2018, https://www.justicetribune.com/articles/death-white-elephant-hague Shortly thereafter, another organization based in The Hague, the Center for International Legal Cooperation, considered a 'structural cooperation' out of a sense of responsibility for the loss of the subsidized funds. After viewing the financial documents, the CILC was startled by the 'deplorable situation'. Allegedly, Williams was seen behind the paper shredder for hours before his departure, which documents in question were destroyed is unclear. Anton Nijssen, Williams' close associate for a long time, has been appointed by the Supervisory Board as' liquidator 'who has to take care of' the (financial) handling of cases'. There are numerous creditors, including the former landlord VNG and the Indisch Herinneringscentrum, which later moved into the spacious building of the former The Hague Institute for Global Justice. Williams' mismanagement is said to have been the main reason for the subsequent failure of the institute. Former board chair Benschop says: \\"In all fairness, in other circumstances with other people, you might have been able to continue a little longer because you had brought in a little more money.\\"' Following the reports of the alleged mismanagement, the topic was raised in the Dutch parliament where several political parties have asked parliamentary questions to the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate, Eric Wiebes. Willem Moorlag from the Dutch socialist party PvdA asked the minister whether there is any judicial ground to recover the lost funds from Williams and/or the Supervisory Board. The right-wing Forum voor Democratie (FvD) asked the minister why no action was undertaken against Williams when it was already clear after several months that he didn't fulfill his role as funds raiser. Jan Paternotte from the social liberal D66 asked the minister how it was possible that the Institute still received subsidies after a critical report by Price Waterhouse Coopers exposed the financial mismanagement.

In October 2013, he sold his stake in the company, which was at the time the largest pornography operator in the world. Since then he acts as an angel investor for young Startups in Brussels, Belgium where he also operates a co-working and incubation space, SN-Cube.  Life and career  Thylmann was born in D√ºsseldorf. He is married with two children. He started computer programming when he was 17. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s when he developed software called NATS (Next-generation Affiliate Tracking Software), which enabled website operators to track users' clicks on advertisements and links so that they could be paid commission. Thylmann used the money he made with NATS to buy various Internet pornography companies, and in March 2010, he established Manwin by acquiring the companies Mensef and Interhub. Manwin bought Pornhub, YouPorn, RedTube, Brazzers, Twistys.com, Mofos and other pornography websites.  Sale of Manwin  In October 2013, Thylmann stepped down and sold Manwin for ‚Ç¨73 million, for undisclosed reasons. Upon the sale of Manwin, Thylmann wrote in a letter to employees:  Extradition and indictment  In December 2012, Thylmann was extradited from Belgium to Germany on suspicion of tax evasion.

They are classified in a clan together with the IAB meteorites and the winonaites. Description IIICD meteorites consists dominantly of meteoric iron with silicate inclusions. The silicate inclusions are almost identical to the IAB meteorite inclusions. They contain low-Ca pyroxene, high-Ca pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, troilite, graphite, different phosphates, meteoric iron and traces of daubr√©elite and chromite. Parent body It has been established that IAB meteorites and winonaites originated from the same parent body. The same is not yet clear for IIICD meteorites, that originated from the same or a very similar asteroid. Classification The IIICD meteorites are classified as primitive achondrites because they have silicate inclusions and show signs of partial melting. The silicate inclusion are almost identical to silicate inclusions in IAB meteorites, and both are very similar to winonaites. For this reason all three are grouped into the IAB-IIICD-Winonaite clan.

Built in the early 19th century, it has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its significance in local history. When constructed in 1812, the Travellers' Rest Inn was Greenfield's first stone building. In its earliest years, the inn served travellers at long wooden tables in a large common room. Some arrived by stagecoach; others by boats on Paint Creek, a tributary of the Scioto River. One year after being established, the community's first post office also set up at the inn, under the supervision of Noble Crawford, who had overseen the inn's construction. After Greenfield's first physician Garvin Johnson married Crawford's daughter, Johnson moved into the old inn, where he set up his doctor's office in part of it. The inn closed in 1829. The building was then used as a combined house and office by another Greenfield physician.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 772. Two stories tall, the inn is covered with a shingled gabled roof; it is one bay wide on the sides and three wide on the front. The Greenfield Historical Society purchased it and moved it to its current location, placing it on a concrete foundation., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2012-12-17. The Society operates the former inn as its headquarters and as one of several house museums.Greenfield Historical Society Exhibits , Greenfield Historical Society, n.d. Accessed 2012-12-17. In 1979, the inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture.

Arnold (March 29, 1839 in County Clare, Ireland ‚Äì December 11, 1890 in Unadilla, Otsego County, New York) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. Life He was born as Michael Edwards in County Clare, Ireland. The family emigrated to the United States during the 1840s and settled on a farm near West Hartford, Connecticut. Aged 12 years, he changed his name to Benjamin Franklin Arnold and went to live with a family in Gilbertsville where he attended the local Academy. Later he changed his name to Frank B. Arnold and had this change legalized by the court. He graduated from Hamilton College, paying his tuition by teaching at the Unadilla Academy. While teaching, he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1864, and commenced practice in Binghamton. In 1867, he removed to Omaha, Nebraska, but returned two years later to Unadilla. In 1873, he married Clarissa Mygatt Sands (1845‚Äì1881), and they had a daughter Clarissa Sands Arnold (1877‚Äì1926). The mother died in 1881, after giving birth to a boy who died soon after too. Arnold was Supervisor of the Town of Unadilla from 1879 to 1885; Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Otsego County in 1881; a member of the New York State Assembly (Otsego Co., 2nd D.) in 1885, 1886 and 1887; and a member of the New York State Senate (23rd D.) in 1888 and 1889. In November 1890, he ran for Congress in the 24th District, but was defeated by Democrat John S. Pindar. During the election campaign, the newspapers unearthed the fact of his name change and intimated that it had been done \\"for dishonorable and degrading reasons.\\" Depressed by the defeat and the slander campaign, he shot himself dead in his office with a pistol which had been the \\"murder weapon\\" in a case which he had defended in 1887, when he had obtained a verdict of manslaughter for his client. He was buried at St. Matthew's Cemetery in Unadilla. Sources * The New York Red Book compiled by Edgar L. Murlin (published by James B.

SME were a North American punk band from Rome, Georgia. The band was formed in July 1999 by founding members Josh Chambers and Kevin Highfield.  History  Origins (1999) In October 1999, the Sloppy Meateaters recorded their debut album, Shameless Self-Promotion. The album was first released without a record label in December 1999. After playing to an audience of over a million viewers on the now-cancelled USA Network show Farmclub.com, the band had hit a break. Sloppy Meateaters released Forbidden Meat in early 2001 on Orange Peal Records. The band spent the entire year touring in support of the new album, booking all of the tours themselves. SME played one show at the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame, did a week on the Warped tour, and ended the tour in fall 2001 by crashing their van into a police car on the interstate. By the following spring, SME did a number of tours at this time including the Vans Warped Tour. Highfield decided to leave the band in late 2002 and Chambers felt it was better to retire the name instead of continuing on without him.

Born in Fowler, California, he has taken the Muslim name El Muhajir. His work has been associated with the Black Arts/Black Aesthetics Movement of the 1960s. Family life He grew up in Fresno and Oakland, in an activist household. He graduated from Thomas Alva Edison High School in Fresno in 1962. His parents published the Black-owned paper of Fresno, California, called the Fresno Voice. The 1947 paper advertised community events, local businesses, including their own real-estate business, and focused on national and state events including: the promotion of anti-lynching laws, Jackie Robinson Day, New York Freedom Trains being integrated, the mission work of the Catholic church with Indians and Negroes, and the $350 million expansion of PG&E; in California. Marvin X has four living children and one son who preceded him in death. Black Arts Movement Because of X's affiliations with Black Panther activists of the day (Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver) and his work in Black theater with Ed Bullins, X is considered one of the major essayists and playwrights of the Black Aesthetics Movement. He attended Merritt College, where he met Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, and received his BA and MA in English from San Francisco State University. X has taught at San Francisco State University, Fresno State University, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Mills College, Merritt College, Laney College, the University of Nevada at Reno and Reedley Community College. He has lectured at colleges and universities, including the University of Arkansas, the University of Houston, Morehouse and Spelman Colleges, the University of Virginia, Howard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Fresno City College, Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, NYU, and UMass Boston. X attended Oakland City College (Merritt College), where he was introduced to Black nationalism and became friends with future Black Panther founders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. X earned a B.A. and M.A. in English from San Francisco State University and emerged as an important voice in the Black Arts Movement (BAM), the artistic arm of the Black Power movement, in the mid-to-late 1960s. He wrote for many of the BAM's key journals. He also co-founded, with playwright Ed Bullins and others, two of BAM's premier West Coast headquarters and venues ‚Äî Oakland's Black House and San Francisco's Black Arts/West Theatre. In 1967, X joined the Nation of Islam and became known as El Muhajir. In the 1980s, he organized the Melvin Black Forum on Human Rights and the first Annual All Black Men's Conference. He also served as an aide to former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver and created the short-lived Marvin X Center for the Study of World Religions. In 1999, he founded San Francisco's Recovery Theatre. His production of One Day in the Life, the play he wrote about his drug addiction and recovery, became the longest-running African-American drama in Northern California. In 2004, in celebration of Black History Month, he produced the San Francisco Tenderloin Book Fair (also known as the San Francisco Black Radical Book Fair) and University of Poetry. He has taught Black Studies, drama, creative writing, journalism, English and Arabic at a variety of California universities and colleges. One of the movers and shakers of the Black Arts Movement (BAM), Marvin X has published 30 books, including essays, poems, plays, anthologies and his autobiography, Somethin‚Äô Proper. Notable books include Fly to Allah, Beyond Religion, Toward Spirituality, and How to Recover from the Addiction to White Supremacy. In 2011, UC Berkeley Bancroft Library acquired the Marvin X papers.

They thus form the largest diameter of any part of the crankshaft. Rather than a conventional crankcase that has webs across it to support the narrow bearings of a conventional crankcase, the crankcase now has a large tunnel through it, hence the name. Tunnel crankcases appeared in the 1930s with the first high-speed diesel engines. They were favoured by some makers more than others, notably Saurer in Switzerland and Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH (now MTU) Friedrichshafen. They are described as both 'tunnel crankcases' and 'roller bearing cranks'; the two aspects are related and it is unclear as to which gave rise to the other.  Origins  Semi-tunnel crankshaft from a Tatra T27 This is a built-up crankshaft with bolted webs. The crank bearings (excluding the bearing races) are smaller than the webs. The end bearings of this semi-tunnel crankshaft (not shown) are also of conventional small size. With the development of the high-speed diesel engine around 1930, powerful diesel engines became available in the sizes previously used by lower-powered petrol engines. In particular, their high BMEP and high torque led to high forces on the crankshaft bearings. These forces were greater than could be sustained by the small whitemetal bearings used for petrol engines. Although aircraft and sports car engines in the 1920s developed to have considerable power in a small space, these were high maintenance machines with regular servicing. The new diesels were intended for long commercial service where maintenance was a key cost to be reduced. The need for an improved bearing technology led to the adoption of roller bearings, rather than whitemetal. Although they might be considered esoteric today, ball and roller crankshaft bearings were already in use in the 1920s for such mundane engines as the Austin 7. Roller bearings require one-piece races for both inner and outer bearing tracks. Although split races are possible, they are expensive and difficult to fit.Split-race roller bearings have been used for the centre big-end bearing in the connecting rod of some three-cylinder steam locomotives. As the crank axle is complex and also includes the wheels, it is impossible to fit roller bearings to the centre in any other way. Whitemetal bearings were much more common, but were a recognised weak point of some classes, such as the LNER A4 A simpler means of fitting roller bearings is to enlarge the diameter of the bearing, so that it becomes larger than the entire crankshaft web. Assembly is now done by putting the outer race of the bearing over the crankshaft axially from one end, rather than by assembling two pieces radially. An early development was the semi- tunnel crankshaft. This used large ball or roller bearings of the tunnel style for their centre bearings, but the end bearings (carrying the load of pistons on only a single side) remained with a small diameter bearing of conventional style. This reduced the bearing cost, and also reduced the linear speed of these smaller bearings. This was important as it also reduced the speed of the crankcase oil seals alongside them. Roller bearing crankshafts were favoured in central Europe: Germany, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, owing to the local development and predominance of rolling-element bearings, in contrast to the improved metallurgy being developed for plain bearing materials in the English-speaking world.  Maybach petrol engines  Tunnel crankshafts were only rarely applied to petrol engines. The development of large powerful engines, outside the rarefied aerospace materials of aircraft engines, coincided with the development of practical lightweight diesel engines that tended to supplant petrol. One market that remained with petrol was that of engines for airships, a market in which Maybach was predominant. Although diesel engines were developed for airship use, these were generally unsuccessful. The British Beardmore Tornado was based on medium-speed diesel engine practice and was both heavy, underpowered and unreliable. Only Maybach made significant use of tunnel crankshafts for petrol engines, with both its airship engines and also a number of World War II tank engines, such as the Maybach HL210 and HL230. These engines were used across all of the German medium and heavy tanks. Thousands of these engines were produced, although surviving examples are now extremely rare, particularly in working order.  Maybach diesel engines  After the war, Maybach applied its knowledge of compact, high-speed engines to diesel engines, for the emerging market in diesel railway locomotives. These engines contrasted with those from other makers by being particularly powerful, both by weight and by volume. This was especially the case for the length, as Maybach's engines used a compact V layout at a time when most makers were still building long single-bank inline engines. Maybach's name became particularly associated with the tunnel crankcase design and these engines are still the best-known uses of the tunnel crankshaft. These engines were widely used in Germany, for locomotives such as the V200 class. In the UK they were both imported and also built locally under licence. Following German practice, these high-speed engines were used in conjunction with a hydraulic transmission, in order to produce a powerful, but lightweight locomotive, compared to the competing diesel-electric designs. The engines were also sold to the USA, although there they were used in the more established diesel-electric designs.  Built-up and one-piece cranks  The first tunnel crankshafts were built-up with webs bolted to the side of the main bearings, much as for a conventional crankshaft, only larger (see cross- section illustration of the Saurer engine). Examples of these were also built by John Fowler & Co. in England. A tunnel crankshaft, fractured through one crankpin A later development was to enlarge the main bearings sufficiently to be larger than the entire crank web. This now permitted the use of a one piece crankshaft A tunnel crankshaft is considered to be a 'tunnel' if the outside diameter over the outer race of the installed bearings is larger than the maximum size of the webs. Early, or smaller, engines may have had crankshafts with bearing journalsThe 'journal' is the part of the shaft forming the bearing, the bearing races are a separate component that fits over this. smaller than this, but were still considered as such because they were larger when the bearings were fitted. To avoid passing the entire crankshaft through the bearings, the bearing diameters were usually stepped in size, in a conical progression. Each bearing now only needed to be slid through the length of its own width, being small enough to pass easily through any preceding housings. This meant that the crankshaft could only be inserted from one end of the crankcase.  Advantages  Relative lengths of crankshafts V8 tunnel crankcase engine Straight 6 engine with conventional crank Straight 8 engine with conventional crank ; Bearing diameter Larger bearings can support the loads of these higher-force engines. ; Use of roller bearings These can cope with the greater forces and higher speeds of the new high-speed engines. ; Assembly The crankshaft can be inserted into an assembled crankcase, rather than the bearing caps being assembled around it. This is usually done by rotating the crankcase end-upwards and then lowering the crankshaft vertically into it. This was a noted feature of some 1960s Maybach engines, used for diesel locomotives. ; Reduced crankshaft length The length previously required for one web + bearing + web group is now replaced by a single bearing length, also acting as both webs. As this reduced crankshaft length also reduces the spacing between cylinders, it was one factor in encouraging the use of tunnel crankshafts in V engines, where there is more axial distance available between adjacent cylinders. This further reduces the overall length of tunnel crankshaft engines. ; Increased crankshaft stiffness The crankshaft, particularly along the webs, becomes wider and so stiffer.  Disadvantages  ; Increased linear bearing speed By simple geometry, as the bearing diameter increases, so too does the linear speed at the bearing surface. This exceeds that possible for whitemetal bearings. Roller bearings were thus not only one reason for the enlarged tunnel crankshaft, but they were also made necessary by it. ; Crankshaft manufacturing The diameter and mass of the crankshaft is increased, such that it will no longer fit into standard crankshaft grinding machines and may require specialised machinery for their manufacture. Although the reduced length of the crankshaft may allow large engines to be built with shorter machinery. ; Crankshaft inertia The enlarged webs have greater mass, thus greater rotational inertia, particularly as they place this mass at the greatest radius away from the axis of the crankshaft. This gives an engine that is slower to accelerate, although it also means that the engine maintains a constant speed more easily under a rapidly varying load. For this reason, the tunnel crankshaft is most appropriate to engines running for long periods at constant speed, such as generator sets, railway locomotives and boats. They are not used for cars, where rapid acceleration and deceleration is needed. ; Crankcase rigidity The large amount of material removed from the crankcase to provide the tunnel does not allow as much space for stiffening webs across the crankcase, so the overall rigidity of the crankcase may be less.  Two-stroke engines  Small two stroke crankshaft with disk webs, but not a tunnel crankshaft Many small crankcase compression two-stroke engines have a crankshaft with large circular webs, similar to the tunnel crankshaft. However these webs are merely webs, not bearings, and their bearings are of conventional small diameter alongside the webs. These enlarged webs are used instead to increase the compression ratio of the engine. By filling more of the 'dead' crankcase volume, the ratio between the swept volume of the cylinder and the remaining crankcase volume is increased. Some multi-cylinder two-stroke engines also use crankcase compression, almost all of them marine outboard motors. In these engines, the separate crankcase volume for each cylinder must be kept separate. The webs are thus made circular, large and sealed by gas seals on their outer circumference. Again, these are not considered as tunnel crankshafts if the webs only carry a seal, but may be so if the large web also forms the bearing.  See also  * Eccentric, a similar approach for cranks that are driven by the axle, particularly for steam locomotive valve gear. The eccentric is enlarged in diameter until it too is bigger than the overall diameter of the crank web. * Undercut crankshaft, a technique for shortening the overall length of a crankshaft by overlapping the bearings.

The film is a documentary of the crimes and human rights violations impositioned on the people of Kashmir, especially on women. The film covers the mass rape incident of Kunan Poshpora. The film, supported by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, was banned from screening by the University of Kashmir and the Aligarh Muslim University on their respective campuses. Attempts were also made by the activists of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to block the film from being screened.  Production  Bilal conceived of the idea of exploring the situation of the women of the region while filming an earlier documentary on child labour in Kashmir. The original proposal was for a much longer film, but it was later shortened on the advice of the PSBT. The film was shot over 10 days on location in the villages of Kunan Poshpora and Shopian. It took several negotiations with the villagers before they would consent to tell their stories on camera; at first only the men were willing, but after four visits the women agreed to be filmed. A team of four young women assisted in the filming. The PSBT recommended that the 78 minutes originally planned for be cut to 26 minutes, so as to fall under the short film category, and requested that a disclaimer accompany the film. The Censorship certificate was then granted.  Obstacles to screening  The film was banned from screening by the University of Kashmir and the Aligarh Muslim University on their respective campuses. It was reported in 2013 that the only screening of the film in India was at the film festival of the Federation of Film Societies of India. Outside India, it was screened at the Human Rights International Film Festival and the Al Jazeera film festival in Doha. It was also reported that the activists of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) attempted to block the screening of the film at a film festival in Thrissur in 2014, but the local police cleared the activists, allowing the screening to proceed.

Market Rasen), Lincolnshire Willingham House was a country house in North Willingham (Nr. Market Rasen), Lincolnshire, England. It was built around 1790 for Ayscoghe Boucherett and is attributed to the architect Robert Mitchell (a similar building design can be seen in the engraving Selwood Park (Silwood Park), in the County of Berkshire, the Seat of James Sibbald Esqr - designed 1788). The Boucherett family were regularly painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, P.R.A. (1769-1830) who is believed to have visited the house to undertake a series of sketches of the children over a period of around five years. Unusual for a very large house of this period, Willingham House could be viewed easily from the main road, from Market Rasen to Louth. The small lake in front of the house still remains, although now obscured by mature trees from the main road. Demolition Willingham House was blown up at 2 pm on 7 June 1967 by explosives set by the Royal Engineers following years of neglect. The roof timbers were suffering from wood beetle which was making the building unstable. There was little appreciation of the heritage of the 1790 building by the local authorities, perhaps surprisingly for a county, noted for its conservation of ecclesiastical architecture since the 18th century. However, the house had been a prison camp during and following WW2, then a Ministry of Defence training camp and was unlikely to be taken on again by a family. The repair costs outweighed conversion costs and the feeling was that something should be done rather than leave a dangerous ruin unattended. To avoid the hazard of collapse (and for economical reasons) after a careful demolition and salvage operation, the decision was taken to use dynamite. To ensure complete destruction the portico had its pillars loaded with explosives to do the job, thus reducing the remains to nothing more than land-fill. The beautiful wrought iron stair rails are thought to have been taken away for their scrap value, not having any practical use for anything else at that time. The decorative plastered ceilings and walls were all destroyed. Very few images survive of the interior, or the back of the hall, which was made up of the service buildings and stables (3/4 of the total building area). Remnants of some of the out-buildings survive today in what is now an industrial park.

Swedish three-foot gauge railways (Swedish: \\"trefotsbanor\\") are railways with the gauge , or 3 Swedish feet in the old Swedish measurement system. Railways with this gauge have only existed in Sweden. This was the most common narrow gauge in Sweden. Sweden once had some fairly extensive narrow-gauge railways, but most are now closed. Some were converted to standard gauge (the latest one was KBJ, Kalmar - Berga J√§rnv√§g, between Berga and Kalmar in the 1970s) and some remain as heritage railways. The only commercial Swedish three foot gauge railway still in use is the suburban railway Roslagsbanan ('the Roslag Railway') in north-eastern Stockholm. The parts of this railway which is still in use will be in continual use in the foreseeable future, with new trains to be delivered in 2020 and there are even plans for a new line to connect this railway to Arlanda Airport. A branch line of Roslagsbanan, L√•ng√§ngsbanan, was built in 1911 and ran for some years as an isolated standard gauge tramway in anticipation of a planned conversion of the main line to raise its capacity, but those plans came to naught and the branch was rebuilt to narrow gauge in 1934; it is closed since 1966. The Nordmark-Klar√§lvens J√§rnv√§g (NKlJ) was a 175 km network issued from different lines built from 1873. It was electrified in 1920, with 15 AEG-locomotives. A new class of 5 locomotives (ASEA) went in 1961. The network was dismantled in 1990. Only Karlstad-Skoghall was regauged to standard gauge and transferred to SJ. article in swedish The longest remaining Swedish three foot gauge railway is the 126 km heritage line from √Öseda to Virserum, Hultsfred and V√§stervik. between Hultsfred and V√§stervik are served by daily tourist trains in the summer, including of dual gauge track. Tourist railbuses also run along the southernmost 27 km (√Öseda‚ÄìVirserum), albeit less frequent. The middle section (Virserum‚ÄìHultsfred, 29 km) is only used by draisines or not at all. The Vadstena‚ÄìF√•gelsta narrow gauge railway was part of a larger network in √ñsterg√∂tland. The gauge difference to the internationally much more used is small, only 9 mm, and some used 900 mm vehicles have been brought to Sweden and given a slight wheel adaptation.

The institution's main function is to prepare qualified staff for employment within the marine-trade fleet and maritime transport infrastructure. Batumi State Maritime Academy provides an educational process that is in accordance with Georgian legislation as well as the international STCW Convention. History Batumi Maritime Technical University was inaugurated in 1929. On March 5, 1944, the self-defense committee of the Soviet Union created the Batumi Maritime Institute. The institute played an important role in the development of maritime activities in the Soviet Union as a whole. The institute has taught up to 5,000 highly qualified maritime specialists; their graduates continue to work on ocean ships across the world. The academy was created by the Georgian government in 1992, shortly after gaining independence following the dissolution of the USSR. Following the nationwide reform of the education system in 2004, BSMA received legal status as a teaching university on April 25, 2005. One of the most notable persons to have studied in the academy was Anatoli Kacharava. Briefly after World War II he began teaching there as a full-time lecturer. After his death in 1982, he was honourably buried in the territory of the academy.History of Georgian seafaring ‚Äî Merab Megrelishvili, Shota Makharadze, 2012, Tbilisi Education The academy offers education in many fields within the maritime industry. Maritime graduates occupy leadership positions on crews of maritime trade ships, maritime crewing companies and other public and private maritime services, whose activities are related to maritime transport, control and management. BSMA promotes the development of maritime institutions in the Black Sea region. Its proximity to Batumi, Poti and Kulevi ports and Supsa customs create excellent conditions for students to work with qualified staff. Maritime transportation and related services or activities are regulated by national legislation and by international regulations, such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The basic legislative document of IMO is the STCW Convention. Georgia joined the convention in 1993, giving BSMA the responsibility of preparing qualified staff for international maritime trading and shipping industries. The core of the education system of the college is its maritime engineering faculty. However, the second largest faculty, called Business and Management, also enjoys popularity within high-school seniors willing to receive education within this field. The academy frequently receives international delegations from Poland,http://www.ipress.ge/new/22055-batumshi-polonetis-shcecinis- sakhelobis-sazghvao-akademiis-delegacia-imyofeba Norway,http://bsma.edu.ge/main/page/875/index.html Ireland,https://bsma.edu.ge/new/main/page/812/index.html Turkey, and others, some of which are within the European Erasmus+ programme while others establish student exchange programs, mutual training and general partnership agreements.

It has an online database of over 10,000 operating and planned utility-scale solar generating stations. Many of the larger stations are shown on a global mapping system. The Wiki-Solar resource is linked to a book on the same topic. Database of solar generation assets The core database holds information about known photovoltaic generating projects. It records the project name, location, generating capacity and site area. It also stores key design data such as the projected annual output and carbon emission savings. The database also records, where known, the key project participants; namely the owner, the developer, the EPC contractor, the solar module and inverter suppliers and the utility to which the electrical output is delivered. This database enables the extraction of global data on deployment of utility-scale solar generation, used by many industry authorities. Most of the projects in the List of photovoltaic power stations are shown in the database and on the mapping. Definition of utility-scale solar power Projects are included in the database where they meet the definition for 'utility-scale solar'. The debate on this definition was initiated by the Berkeley Energy and Resources Cooperative. Wiki-Solar concluded that it would set the threshold to include all systems above 4MW AC. Basis of capacity data This information resource has now standardized on quoting capacity figures in MWAC This avoids the issue where some plant capacities are quoted in megawatts peak, the DC output of the solar array; while others are in MWAC, the output delivered to the grid. The AC measure was selected to make it comparable to ratings of other electricity generation technologies. Mapping Wiki-Solar's mapping shows markers for all projects over 10 megawatts peak (MWP), where the location is known. Many projects between 5 and 10 MWP are also shown, and differentiated with smaller markers. The maps differentiate between operating projects, and those under construction and planned. The few decommissioned projects are also shown. Site plans A separate mapping system shows the actual site footprints of all projects where the site area is known. Some of these are now visible on published satellite views, while others have been taken from site plans, but should appear on satellite photography in the future. Statistical analysis Based on the many projects recorded on the database, Wiki-Solar produces statistics on a global and regional basis showing key parameters such as the site area per megawatt of capacity and the annual energy delivered. Based on at the applicable local energy costs and carbon intensities, it derives a value index for each geographic region. National analysis Wiki-Solar lists the leading countries based on their deployment of utility scale of photovoltaic power stations and summarises data by continent. It also shows trends to indicate the relative progress in different countries, and is referenced by other experts in the sector. For the purpose of this analysis, the data is based on installations of 4 MWAC and above in accordance with Wiki-Solar's definition of 'utility-scale'. Individual national maps are available for countries with a significant number of installations. Annual data After the end of each year statistics are provided showing the year's figures for each country alongside the cumulative capacity to date. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2013 was reported to be 21 GW. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2014 was reported to be 36 GW. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2015 was reported to be over 60 GW. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2016 was reported to be 96 GW. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2017 was reported to be 137 GW. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2018 was reported to be c. 180 GW. The global capacity of utility-scale PV power generation at the end of 2019 was reported to be c. 220 GW. Company analysis Using a similar calculation basis to the National analysis above, Wiki-Solar produces lists of the leading participants for each of the major roles described above, again used by industry analysts. Individual maps are available for companies with a significant number of installations. Solar Photovoltaic Projects book Solar Photovoltaic Projects in the mainstream power market' was published by Routledge in October 2012 and written by Philip Wolfe. It covers all aspects of the development, construction and operation of utility scale of photovoltaic generating stations.

This status ranks the cathedral among the most important buildings of the Hungarian Greek Catholic Church. The origins of the current cathedral reaches back to 1312, when historical notes mention that a church existed in the medieval settlement of Dorogegyh√°za.Cs√°nki (2002) p. 535-6; 528; 633 However, the present building has 17th century foundations, and it went through several building extensions and renovations during its history. The latest restoration were completed in 2006.P√°sztor (2008) p. 16 Pope Pius X raised the church to the rank of a cathedral in 1912 when he erected the Diocese of Hajd√∫dorog with the papal bull Christifideles Graeci. The interior reflects the traditions of the Greek Catholic liturgy and architecture. The most spectacular sign of it is the 200 years old iconostasis. The 11 meters (36 feet) tall wall of icons separates the three naves and the altar. The iconostasis contains 54 holy images and it is considered as one of the most important iconostasis in Hungary. More than 80% of the inhabitants of Hajd√∫dorog are Greek CatholicKSH 2001 thus the cathedral is a central scene for the everyday life of the town, especially during major religious feast days. The most visited events of the cathedral are the Christmas procession and the traditional Easter services when a local bread, the p√°szka is sanctified. History of the cathedral The predecessor of the modern days Hajd√∫dorog was founded around the beginning of the 12th century. The center of the medieval town should have been around the present area of the cathedral.Kniezsa (2001) p. 118-119; 126‚Äì127 The manuscripts from 1312 name the town Dorogegyh√°za meaning Church of Dorog. This let historians think that some sort of Catholic church stood in the center of the settlement, probably in the place of today's cathedral.Fej√©r (1832) p. 485 However, the present character of the religion in Hajd√∫dorog started to take shape after the settlement of the Hajduks in the 17th century. According to the diploma of Korpona, issued by prince Stephen Bocskay in 1605 and reassured by palatine Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥ in 1616, Dorog along with other towns in the region became the possession of the Hajduks. The prince also granted them titles of nobility as a reward for their help in the wars against the Turks.Diploma of palatine Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥ The new owners of Dorog were all warriors and Orthodox Christians, but according to the palatine's list, most of them had Hungarian names. The Hajduks finally settled to Dorog in 1616. The first notes about the settlement's Byzantine rite community are from 1638. Bazil Taraszovics, bishop of Munk√°cs appointed Dorog's priest, Radivoj Marinics, archdeacon. The remarkable position refers to the strength and prestige of the community.V√©ghse≈ë, Terdik (2012) p. 114-115 The Hajduks started to build a small fort in the center of the town. To defend the fort, they also constructed a brick watchtower. The tower was finished by 1640, and now it serves as the lower part of the cathedral's bell tower. Within the walls of Hajd√∫dorog, close to the watchtower, stood the remains of the old stone church. A number of Romanians fled to the newly established town to escape from the Turkish troops. The Byzantine community was soon split to two parishes: one parish served in Romanian language and the other in Church Slavonic (Hungarian wasn't a liturgical language in Eastern Orthodoxy, so it couldn't be used).Dercs√©nyi (1991) p. 278Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p. 1-3V√©ghse≈ë, Terdik (2012) p. 114-115 The two parishes agreed in the use of the church building in 1667.Episcopal Archives (1999) V 1972 The fort, the stone church and the watchtower were seriously damaged during the wars of the 17th century. In 1742 the tower was rebuilt close to the medieval church, and it reached the height of 24 m (78.7 ft.).V√©ghse≈ë, Terdik (2012) p. 114-115 In 1646, the Hajduks were still busy with the construction of their fortifications against the Turkish army, when in Ungv√°r Eastern Orthodox bishops and priests signed the Union of Ungv√°r creating a new and independent Greek Catholic Apostolic Vicariate, where later Hajd√∫dorog belonged to.Pirigyi (2010) The Greek Catholic Church in Hajd√∫dorog on an etching from 1859 The importance of the Greek Catholic Church in Hungary increased under the rule of the strict Catholic Maria Theresa, who thought of Greek Catholicism as a consensus between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. The empress erected the Eparchy of Munk√°cs in 1771 and ordered Hajd√∫dorog under its jurisdiction. The Greek Catholic parish in Hajd√∫dorog had an adroit leader in these years, called Andr√°s Bacsinszky, later bishop of Munk√°cs. He organized the construction of the Greek Catholic church of the town, collecting the funds from the inhabitants. Bacsinszky even set up a brickwork in 1752 to produce building material for the church. The construction started on 2 September 1764 under the control of an architect, called Thomas from Munk√°cs, and lasted until November 1772.Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p. 4-5V√©ghse≈ë, Terdik (2012) p. 114-115 The watchtower of the Hajduks was extended to reach the 48 m (157.5 ft) height, and topped by a Rococo (Zopf style) clad spire. The late baroque church itself was attached to the eastern side of the tower. It included only one nave in that time and had a length of 30 m (98.4 ft) and a width of 11 m (36 ft).Berci (2001) The 17th-century tower had now double the size, and the old foundations were unable to carry the weight of the steeple. The tower had to be strengthened in 1784 and 1791, but in the end the carpenters had to remove 9.5 m (31.2 ft) from the spire of the steeple in 1857. (This is the reason why the shape of the present bell tower differs from the one on the etching from 1859.)Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p. 4-5 The parish of the new baroque church didn't spare money on the interior either. After the constructions of the church had finished, the priest hired painters, carvers and gilders to ornate the interior of the church according to the Byzantine traditions. The episcopal throne, the pulpit, the iconostasis, the side altar and the main altar with the canopy were made for the baroque church between 1790 and 1816. The first (and for a long time the only) fresco, depicting the Trinity, was painted in 1780 by an unknown diocesan artist. According to the latest research in the archive of the diocese, and based on the professional report of the restorers, the parish hired the highest qualified iconostasis carver, called Mikl√≥s Jankovits who probably worked with a local carver, L√°szl√≥ Lengyel.Nagy (1994) p. 52 The church contracted with M√°ty√°s Hittner and J√°nos Sz≈±cs in 1808 to paint the icons of the iconostasis. They finished the work in 1816.Dercs√©nyi (1991) p. 278Terdik (2010) By the 19th century the Greek Catholic Church established a strong and stable position in the Habsburg Monarchy. The only thing that shattered its unity was the rising of nationalism. Hungarian speaking Greek Catholics still couldn't use their mother tongue in their holy services, so they started to raise their voice for the Hungarian liturgy. This movement was started by Hungarian translations of religious texts, sermons and songs; and later peaked with the so-called Hajd√∫dorog Movement. In 1821 the town council of Hajd√∫dorog abolished the Romanian parish and its services, because the majority of the town spoke Hungarian. Thus the only Greek Catholic parish that remained, served in Church Slavonic language.Episcopal Archives (1999) D 509; D 573 The lieutenant of Hajd√∫dorog, that time the leader of the town, named Lajos Farkas started a nationwide movement for the papal acknowledgement of the Hungarian language in Greek Catholic liturgy. Farkas' initiative spread quickly in the country among the Hungarian speaking Greek Catholics. The case got influential supporters from the upper house of the parliament and from the government too, though their purpose was more political than religious. Erecting a Hungarian Greek Catholic diocese was handy for the central government's Magyarization efforts.Niessen (1994) p. 238-257 A Greek Catholic synod was held in the church of Hajd√∫dorog on 16 April 1868 that marked the start of the Movement of Hajd√∫dorog. Due to the decisions of the synod Emperor Franz Joseph erected the Vicariate Forane of Hajd√∫dorog under the jurisdiction of the Eparchy of Munk√°cs. To commemorate and to celebrate the success of the synod, the town decided to renovate and extend the church. The constructions started in the summer of 1868. The Northern and Southern walls of the original church were opened with large arches, and two naves were attached to the baroque building on both sides. These side naves, or aisles, were constructed to hold a gallery accessible by spiral stairways from outside of the church.Guly√°s, Csom√≥s, Seidl (2000) A gallery was created on the western side too allowing access from the bell tower of the church. The church received its present form by the end of the renovation works in 1876. The simple Greek Catholic church was transformed to a three naves basilica. The outside appearance of the building went through major changes too. The church lost its original baroque ornaments, it was replaced by eclectic elements, and the bell tower got larger windows.1868 letter from Diocesan Archive The interior of the church saw large changes and renovation too. The parish hired two painters, Gy√∂rgy R√©v√©sz and Gyula Petrovics, and a gilder, K√°roly M√ºller to renovate and decorate the church interior. R√©v√©sz painted the Last Supper for the main altar and the Descent from the Cross to the side altar. He was the master of the seccos that can be seen in the sanctuary, and probably with the help of Petrovics, he painted the three frescos of the ceiling: Assumption, Destroying the idols and In the age of Saint Stephen. Petrovics and M√ºller restored the iconostasis. They removed all the icons from the wall, Petrovics even made some changes to some of the holy images. They followed a wrong order in the so-called Feasts row when putting the icons back to the iconostasis.Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p. 4-5Berci (2001) The renovated basilica was consecrated in 1876 and in the same time the church got dedicated to the Presentation of Mary. Consecration of Istv√°n Mikl√≥sy, the first bishop of the Diocese of Hajd√∫dorog in 1913 The members of the Hajd√∫dorog Movement realized that their major goal, that is to use the Hungarian as an official language in the Greek Catholic liturgy, can be achieved only through the establishment of an independent Hungarian Greek Catholic diocese. The vicar forane organized a pilgrimage to Rome in 1900 to present their case and their arguments to the pope. Leo XIII granted a papal audience to the representatives of the Hungarian Greek Catholics and considered their case, but didn't erect the new diocese. In 1901 the church regained its original spire to commemorate the pilgrimage to Rome. Under the guidance of G√°bor Katona, carpenter from Hajd√∫n√°n√°s, the spire of the bell tower was removed and replaced according to the original plans. A large, 1 m diameter globe was placed on the top of the Rococo roof structure to hold a Greek Catholic cross made of wrought iron. They put the list of the Roman pilgrims inside of this globe.V√©gh, Cserp√°k (1999) The pilgrimage and the Movement of Hajd√∫dorog finally reached its goal on 8 June 1912, when Pope Pius X erected the Diocese of Hajd√∫dorog in his Christifideles Graeci bull, and raised the church of Hajd√∫dorog to the rank of a cathedral.Pappn√©, Galamb (2000)V√©ghse≈ë Short History of the Diocese Istv√°n Mikl√≥sy the first bishop of the Hungarian Greek Catholic Diocese was consecrated in the cathedral on 5 October 1913. The bishop's offices were moved first to Debrecen, then to Ny√≠regyh√°za because of the lack of infrastructure in Hajd√∫dorog at those times.Galambv√°ri (2009) p. 2-3 In 1938 Budapest hosted the 34th Eucharistic Congress bringing thousands of pilgrims and church leaders to the country. The congress was preceded by an extensive church renovation project throughout the country, not leaving Hajd√∫dorog untouched either. The works started in 1937, and it resulted in a decrease of the artistic value of the building and its interior. Since the renovations were initiated by the Roman Catholic Church, the Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog was restored in a Latin way, losing its Byzantine characteristics. The original frescoes were painted over with low quality, neobaroque images; and all the furniture, including the iconostasis, were colored to oil green. The main altar's Last Supper painting was replaced by the Latin style Enthronement of Mary image. After the Second World War the National Office of Cultural Heritage declared the restoration low quality, and they suggested the removal of the 1937 paintings.Berci (2001) During the years of the communism the cathedral was neglected. The water soaked walls were the largest problem of the building by the 1980s, that threatened the wall paintings of the cathedral. Only temporary solutions were introduced until 2000.Guly√°s, Csom√≥s, Seidl (2000) In 1989 L√°szl√≥ Pusk√°s and his wife, Nadia were selected to repaint the ceiling frescoes of the cathedral. The couple was trained in Ukraine and they finished their work in 1990. The painters coordinated with the priests and the bishop of the cathedral on the theological and iconographical program of the frescoes to replace the Latin rite images.–í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä (1994) p. 26 The fresco of the Pusk√°s couple was consecrated on 21 November 1990, on the 350th anniversary of the cathedral. These paintings cover the ceiling of the cathedral today. Szil√°rd Keresztes, bishop of Hajd√∫dorog started the overall renovation of the neglected cathedral in 1999 after getting financial support from the Hungarian government and the European Union. The walls and the foundations of the church were dried up and insulated, the fa√ßade was restored, the roof and the spire was rebuilt entirely and the church interior was renovated too. Gy√∂rgyi K√°rolyi and Csongor Bed≈ë controlled the restoration of the iconostasis, the altars, the episcopal throne, the pulpit and other furniture. The restoration works lasted until 2006. On 30 June 2008, almost hundred years after the first bishop's consecration, the cathedral hosted P√©ter F√ºl√∂p Kocsis' installation to his episcopal office. Kocsis started to renovate the most important pilgrimage site of the diocese and of the country in M√°riap√≥cs. The shrine houses the holy icon of the Weeping Madonna, which was transferred to the Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog for the time of the renovation works. The icon was displayed on the pulpit from 7 February until 5 September 2009. The holy image of the Theotokos was carried to and from Hajd√∫dorog in a procession.Orosz (2009) p. 2-8 The relics of Saint Stephen, the patron saint of the diocese, and Clemens Maria Hofbauer were placed in the cathedral's Southern nave on 21 November 2010 by bishop Kocsis. The relics were gifts from Christoph Sch√∂nborn, cardinal of Vienna.Dalanics (2010) p. 6 Recently the Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog served as one of the venues of the celebrations of the 100 years old diocese. It hosted the opening ceremony on 18 February 2012 and the Ecumenical Congress of the Carpathian Basin on 1 December.Article on the Ecumenical Congress On 2 December 2012 a new bronze gate was consecrated.Article on the bronze gate The cathedral Floor plan of the cathedral: Green marks the 17th century foundations of the belfry; the baroque walls are in purple, and yellow indicates the 19th century aisles The above lines of the Russian soldier described the Greek Catholic church of Hajd√∫dorog properly in the time of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The 1872 constructions basically didn't change the structure of the cathedral, only added two aisles to the building. The main altar is still facing towards the East according to the traditions of church orientation, and the main entrance, along with the steeple, is situated on the West. The sacristy is on the northern side of the cathedral with a direct connection to the main altar. On the southern side there is a religious store, as the Southern equivalent of the sacristy. The sacristy and the store are covered with flat roof. The three naves have a hip roof made of tin. These are described as domes in the Russian soldier's diary. From inside the main nave's ceiling is constructed as a simple dome under the wooden structure of the roof, with the pendentive being part of the dome. The aisles have the role of emphasizing the area of the main nave, and they are covered with so-called barrel vaults. Above these vaults the galleries look to the nave, again to express its importance. The cathedral has a longitudinal plan with a long nave in the middle. All of the major extensions of the building can be easily connected to an architectural style. The different width of the walls refers to the age, when a particular part of the cathedral was constructed. The foundation of the bell tower is the oldest part of the present day basilica, and it has 190 cm (6.23 ft.) wide walls. The main nave and the apse were added next in the baroque period. The walls here range between 135‚Äì162 cm (4.43‚Äì5.31 ft.) width. The youngest attachments to the cathedral were the aisles in the 19th century. They have the thinnest walls measuring \\"only\\" 80 cm (2.26 ft.).Guly√°s, Csom√≥s, Seidl (2000) Exterior and Architecture The South-Eastern fa√ßade According to an old local saying, the tower of the cathedral can be seen from each street of the town. It was considered as the sign of God's presence everywhere, and it reminded everyone to their Greek Catholic faith. Today this old saying is not quite true, but the fa√ßade of the cathedral is still definitely the most characteristic part of Hajd√∫dorog's townscape. The Cathedral of the Presentation of Mary is 38 m (124.67 ft.) long, 21 m (68.9 ft.) wide and 48 m (157 ft.) tall.V√©gh, Cserp√°k (1999) The Eastern fa√ßade of the building is dominated by the semicircular apse. A 3.5 m (11.48 ft.) tall, marble cross is embedded in the outer wall of the apse. It was erected in 1906 and commemorates four religious missions related to important church events and retreats. According to the records on the cross, the first retreat was between 17‚Äì21 March 1906. The icon of the Theotokos of M√°riap√≥cs started to shed tears for the third times in December 1905. The retreat remembered to this mirracle. The original text on the cross says: Erected to the Memory of the Holy Mission between 17‚Äì21 March. 1906. (Hungarian: Emeltetett az 1906. √âv M√°rcz. 17-21ig Megtartott Szt. Missi√≥ Eml√©k√©re). The second retreat was in 1930 March 22‚Äì30 to join to the Saint Emeric year of the Hungarian Catholic Church. The third holy mission was held on 26 March ‚Äì 3 April 1938 during the Eucharistic Congress in Budapest. The last date carved in the marble cross is 12‚Äì19 March 1944. The exact background of the retreat is unknown, but probably it was connected to World War II. Western fa√ßade of the cathedral The cathedral's fa√ßade on the Southern and Northern side look pretty much the same. The most characteristic part is the 15 m (49.2 ft.) long and 4 m (13 ft.) wide aisle with typical revival style ornaments and partitioning. The gabled fa√ßade reaches 17 m (55.7 ft.) height on both sides. With their robust appearance they are resembling to the Romanesque style. White pilasters frame the sides, and they are running upwards to melt into the arched frieze on the top. Originally a statue stood on the roof above each pilasters, but they were removed during the renovation works in 2000. Four crosses, made of wrought iron, are decorating now the pilasters. The cathedral has gates both on the Southern and the northern side. They are situated in the central axis of the side fa√ßades. The cathedral has altogether 3 entrances. Beside the entrances to the aisles, there is a main gate on the western side, made of bronze. Traditionally those who are living in Hajd√∫dorog, enter the cathedral from their homes' direction. The gates of the aisles look exactly the same. They are framed by white pilasters topped by Doric capitals. The windows of the side naves are on three different levels. There are two arched windows on the level of the entrance. Above them, there are three more windows opening from the so-called choir galleries, and on the top of each aisle fa√ßade a rose window with 8 mullions was added. Changing of the spire in 2000. Note that this exterior shows the old, reverse coloring of the cathedral. The sacristy and the religious store are on the eastern part of the side naves. The flat-roofed buildings have the same width as the 19th century naves. There are two other entrances on the Northern fa√ßade of the basilica. Both of them opens to a spiral stairway. The one, built in the bell tower, leads up to the organ gallery on the West, and the other stairway goes to the Northern choir gallery. There is only one spiral stairway on the southern side of the church. It leads to the Southern choir gallery. Looking to the side fa√ßades of the cathedral there are still two plaques worth to mention. The plaque on the northern side of the tower commemorates the 1869 restoration and extension works: \\"Renovated by the community of Hajdu Dorogh to the glory of Our Lord in 1869\\". The Southern fa√ßade holds a marble plaque about the 1937 renovations: \\"Outer renovation was made in the 1937th year of the Lord to commemorate the 34th Eucharistic Congress. The ornaments of the gates were added in the same year from the donations of the widow lady K√∂mmerling. The work was done by jr. J√°nos Simon, certified stonemason.\\" The Western fa√ßade is the most typical part of the cathedral. It is dominated by the 48 m (157.6 ft.) tall church steeple, which reaches the 50 m (164 ft.) height if we count the Greek Catholic cross on the top. Two belt courses divide the tower into three different parts. The lowest bit is 12 m (39.4 ft.) tall, and just like the main entrance, it is decorated with Doric pilasters. The middle part of the tower is 5 m (16.4 ft.) tall. It has white frames, and its primary function is to connect the main nave and its roof to the bell tower. The tower's top section is 12.5 m (41 ft.) tall. It has two windows, and it is decorated with two pilasters with Corinthian capitals. The three parts of the tower together is 29.5 m (96.8 ft.) tall. This adds up the height of the bell tower, the brick structure of the steeple. The steeple functions also as a clock tower. It has a 2.5 m (8.2 ft.) diameter clock face on the four sides, right under the steeple's belfry part. During the 2000 renovations the clock stopped working. It was only in 2010 when the old, shabby clock work was changed to a new digital engine. The old clock work is still in its original wooden case in the belfry.Compu-Tik The Zopf style spire of the tower was fully renovated in 2000. The wooden structure and also the copper covering was entirely replaced. The lower part of the copper structure is the 11 m (36 ft.) tall belfry. This section houses the bells of the cathedral, and it is enclosed by louvers made of copper. The belfry is topped by the eight columns of the lantern. The 2.5 m (8 ft.) tall columns determine the shape of the highest section of the steeple, the octagonal spire of the cathedral. On the top of the spire there is a 1 m diameter copper globe that works as a time capsule too. This globe holds the original list of the pilgrims to Rome in 1900, the names of the pilgrims who followed their ancestors on bikes one century later, and the list of town dwellers who donated for the renovation works of the cathedral. The globe is situated 48 m (157 ft.) high above the town, and it is holding a 2 m tall Greek Catholic cross.V√©gh, Cserp√°k (1999) Interior of the Cathedral Secco of the Promised Land =The Altar= In the Byzantine rite the altar has a broader meaning. It does not only refer to the altar table, but the area surrounding it. In the Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog the altar includes the sanctuary, the sacred place behind the iconostasis. The altar is the most important part of the church. It is situated on the eastern part of the building based on the traditions. The sanctuary is 7 m (23 ft.) wide and almost 10 m (33 ft.) tall. Its Eastern wall follows the semi-circular shape of the apse. On the western side the sanctuary is closed by the iconostasis. The entire floor of the altar has a 10 cm (4 inches) elevation compared to the level of the main nave. The elevation required a step between the sanctuary and the nave. This 10 cm red marble step can be found in front of the iconostasis, and its area is called soleas. There are three doors in the iconostasis that connect the altar and the main nave. These ornamented doors are only opened during holy service. There is another direct entrance to the altar from the sacristy, where the vestments and other sacred vessels are kept. Three large arched windows let the sun light to the sanctuary. One of them is in the apse, just in front of the altar table. The other two windows are on the Northern and Southern walls. Agnus Dei secco in the sanctuary The sanctuary has seven rather valuable seccos on its walls. The paintings were created by Gy√∂rgy R√©v√©sz during the 1868 renovations, when the church was re-shaped in a Romantic style. One oval shaped mural can be found below and above each window, depicting scenes from the Old Testament. The sanctuary's seventh secco is the triangle shaped Eye of Providence painting which can't be seen from the altar. The only place where the secco is visible, is the organ gallery on the western side of the cathedral. The reason is that the Eye of Providence secco was painted to a wall surface high above the ground level of the altar, and it is parallel to the iconostasis, thus unseen from the sanctuary. The topic and the composition of the three upper seccos appear also on the Royal Doors of the iconostasis: The scene of Cain murders Abel is above the Northern window, the Noah's sacrifice secco is above the Southern window, and the Binding of Isaac scene was painted on the upper part of the apse. The seccos below the windows talk about stories from the Old Testament too, but instead of the upper sacrifice related murals, these are connected to divine prophecies. Below the Northern window, and above the entrance from the sacristy, is the mural of the Promised Land. It shows the land of Canaan, God's reward to Abraham and his descendants if they keep their faith. The lower secco of the Southern wall is called Brass Serpent, and it tells us the story of Moses who mounted a serpent of brass on a pole to cure the Israelites from the bite of the snakes. Later this story was explained in the Gospel of John as a reference to Jesus.C. H. Spurgeon, \\"The Mysteries of the Brazen Serpent\\" , 1857 The secco of the Brass Serpent The secco of the Agnus Dei was painted on the apse, to the most emphasized place, in front of the altar table. The lamb, symbolizing Jesus, is reposing on the Book of the Seven Seals known from the Book of Revelation. The priests, standing and praying at the altar table, are facing this mural. The lamb symbolizes the good shepherd, which is the duty of the priests; and it refers to the revelation too, reminding the priests to the importance of the strong faith.Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p. 4-5 The side altar with R√©v√©sz' Rembrandt replica, the Descent from the Cross The central element of the sanctuary is the altar table with its carved baldachin.The article here followed the terms of the Catholic Encyclopedia, where only the cup shaped, robust altar covers are called ciborium. The Hajd√∫dorog Cathedral's altar table has a voluted top resembling to a cloth canopy, therefore the baldachin term was used in the article. 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Ciborium\\" and Altar Canopy The parish hired Mikl√≥s Jankovits to make the original altar table in 1799. He finished all the carving works for the church within 2 years.Terdik (2010) This original structure was altered several times during the last 200 years. Today only the upper part of the baldachin remained from the original 18th-century altar table. Based on the report of the restorers, the original Jankovits altar probably had a much wider table, and the canopy was a bit shorter than it is today. The priest simply didn't have enough place in the sanctuary: the altar table was too large to walk around it. This problem resulted the first change of the altar in 1870.K√°rolyi, Bed≈ë (2002) The carved foundations of the baldachin's columns were removed, and they were replaced by taller, but really simple, cuboid parts. To provide enough space for the priests, a new, smaller altar table was erected under the baldachin. The table was also turned around with its longer side parallel to the iconostasis. The result of this rearrangement was that the baldachin didn't really fit to the table itself, it was wider than needed. The parish solved this problem by the shortening of the volutes of the upper part of the baldachin. Small parts were sawed and removed from the arched top of the canopy. The re-tailored baldachin was now tall enough to let the altar table being elevated by some steps.K√°rolyi (2001) The tabernacle of today's altar table was made originally for this smaller, second table. In 1872, by the end of the renovations, R√©v√©sz' painting, the Last Supper was displayed on the main altar. The main altar, its baldachin and the tabernacle The main altar's major changes in the 18th century were followed by other smaller alterations in 1937. The cathedral was renovated and repainted for the Eucharistic Congress in Budapest, and since the work was paid and initiated by the Roman Catholic Church, the Latin motifs overwrote several Byzantine marks of the cathedral. The Last Supper was replaced by the Coronation of the Holy Virgin, a typical Latin scene, on the main altar. Two small wings were attached to the tabernacle, and the entire altar was repainted in white. After the Second World War, during the years of the communist regime the church didn't have the funds or the support for any renovation works. The low quality 1937 restoration remained till the fall of the communism. During the long years the main altar got in a rather neglected shape. The truncated baldachin slowly fell to pieces. Its structure had to be supported by two iron rods to prevent from collapsing. The main altar and the baldachin was fully restored in 2005. The major goal of the restorers was to re-create the 18th century Jankovits altar as much as possible. The original coloring of the altar was explored and restored again. The volutes of the baldachin gained back their original size, thus changing the width of the whole canopy. Gy√∂rgyi K√°rolyi, the restorer of the main altar, studied other works of Jankovits (Serb Orthodox Church in Eger; Orthodox Church on Pet≈ëfi Square, Budapest and the Orthodox Church in Miskolc) to replace the missing parts of the altar. K√°rolyi had to create a new altar table and she had to replace the lower parts of the baldachin too. Today her altar is standing in the sanctuary of the cathedral. The altar table was made of oak, and it resembles to a robust marble table. Neither of the previous altar paintings got replaced to the table, only the tabernacle was restored. The foundations of the baldachin's columns were replaced along the guidelines of a committee of the Hungarian Institute of National Cultural Heritage. The committee chose a baldachin leg ending in animal claws, based on the analogy studies on Jankovits' other works. The new foundation and the old canopy was connected by long iron spines in the middle.K√°rolyi 2005 The side altar, also known as prothesis, is traditionally situated on the northern part of the sanctuary in the Byzantine rite churches. Priests prepare the bread and the wine on this smaller altar table for the holy liturgy. In the Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog the prothesis was part of the original, early 19th century furniture made by Mikl√≥s Jankovits. It didn't go through major changes, like the main altar did. The parts above the altar table are original carvings.K√°rolyi, Bed≈ë (2002) The table itself was changed probably in the 1870s. The arched volutes on the top of the prothesis are part of the original, Baroque structure. Two Corinthian columns hold the top structure of the prothesis, and they frame the painting of the side altar. The Descent from the Cross was painted by Gy√∂rgy R√©v√©sz, approximately in 1870. He copied the composition of Rembrandt's 1634 master piece. The prothesis is ornated with typical Jankovits motifs. The gilded festoons, rose heads and acanthus leaves appear on the iconostasis and on other furniture too. The prothesis was over- painted with white oil paint during the Latinizing 1937 renovations. It was restored in 2005.K√°rolyi (2001) =Iconostasis= The iconostasis of the cathedral The iconostasis is undoubtedly the most characteristic part of an Eastern Catholic church interior. The wall of icons is traditionally erected between the altar and the nave. The iconostasis of the Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog is the largest Greek Catholic wall in Hungary. It is 11 m (36 ft.) tall and 7 m (23 ft.) wide, holding 54 icons on five tiers.Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p.4-5 Hajd√∫dorog had the largest number of Greek Catholic inhabitants in the beginning of the 19th century in the Eparchy of Munk√°cs, and by far the largest number of Hungarian speaking Greek Catholics.V√©gshe≈ë (2012) The parish, with the support of the town, decided to hire the most notable iconostase-carver master in the country to express this favored rank. Mikl√≥s Jankovits was hired by the Greek Catholic parish of Hajd√∫dorog in 1799 to carve the wooden framework, including the doors and the icon frames of the iconostasis. M√°ty√°s Hittner and J√°nos Sz≈±ts could only start the painting and gilding works in 1808. The last icon was completed in 1816.Sz. K√ºrti (1989) p.4-5 Michael Archangel on the Northern door of the iconostasis The icons were painted clearly in Western style, quite unusual in Eastern rite churches. Instead of the traditional Byzantine iconographic depiction, the painters used the deep, rich colors, the intense light and dark shadows, and the eventful and realistic portrayal of late Baroque painting. The exact reason for turning towards the Western style is still disputed. However, Greek Catholicism by nature is closer to the Latin Rite, especially in 19th-century Hungary, where most of the population was Roman Catholic. Thus Western art and probably the Catholic rulers of the country, the Habsburgs, influenced the painters and the parish too.De√°k (1992) While the structure of the iconostasis is based on Slavic tradition, it also displays a number of differences. Given Hungary's Roman Catholic majority, the artists who decorated Eastern rite churches usually either copied the style of a church in an Orthodox country or came from an Orthodox country themselves. Jankovits had Greek ancestors, but his icon screens were considered the only works with a style typical of Hungary. He combined several different styles. Rich, gilded ornaments, Zopf shapes of rose heads, tulips and Acanthus leaves characterize his work. Jankovits usually carved figures of animals on the top of the Royal Doors, clearly marking his style. In Hajd√∫dorog he added two ravens.K√°rolyi, Bed≈ë (2002) Another important difference is that the icons do not start from the floor level. Altarpieces, that were not part of the original structure, stand between the holy doors instead. And the lifelike portraits typical of Western style are seldom found on Eastern icon screens.K√°rolyi, Bed≈ë (2002) The iconostasis frames were slightly altered before the icons were completed. A local craftsman probably added the altarpieces between the doors. The icon screen underwent four renovations. The first affected only the so-called \\"Sovereign tier\\" in 1868.K√°rolyi, Bed≈ë (2002) A few years later, in the 1870s the entire work was renovated by Gy√∂rgy R√©v√©sz and his team. In the years preceding the 1938 34th Eucharistic Congress in Budapest, the Catholic Church undertook renovation work in churches throughout the country. In 1937 the iconostasis of Hajd√∫dorog was re-painted in a rather low artistic quality. Gy√∂rgyi K√°rolyi and Csongor Bed≈ë completed the latest renovation in 2002, restoring the original colors and compositions as far as they possibly could.K√°rolyi, Bed≈ë (2002) See also *List of cathedrals in Hungary References Bibliography Primary sources  Secondary sources  * * * Category:Churches in Hungary Category:Eastern Catholic cathedrals in Hungary Category:Hungarian Greek Catholic cathedrals Category:Eastern Catholicism in Hungary Category:Landmarks in Hungary Category:Churches completed in 1772 ","title":"Cathedral of Hajd√∫dorog"},{"id":"37955948","text":"\\"Armagideon Time\\" (spelt as \\"Armigedeon Time\\" in some versions) is a song by Jamaican reggae musician Willie Williams. It was produced by Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, who used the \\"Real Rock\\" riddim. It was first recorded in 1977 at Jamaica Recording Studio in Kingston, Jamaica, and released as a single in 1979 via Studio One. The single was re-released in 1980 and 1982 through Coxsone Records as a title track to Williams' second studio album of the same name. The song was covered by English rock band The Clash in 1979 and released as the B-side to their single \\"London Calling\\".  In popular culture  The song was featured in the 1999 Jim Jarmusch's film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, and appeared in the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the fictional reggae radio station K-JAH Radio West (but wasn't included on the soundtrack album). The song was sampled by KRS-One on the track \\"Black Cop\\" from his 1993 album Return of the Boom Bap, and by Fugees on the track \\"Zealots\\" from their 1996 album The Score.  The Clash version  British band The Clash released a cover of \\"Armagideon Time\\" as the B-side for their \\"London Calling\\" single in 1979. Prior to recording the song, the members of the Clash had been speaking to their associate Kosmo Vinyl, who believed that the ideal length for a single was two minutes and 28 seconds. Clash vocalist Joe Strummer asked Vinyl to stop the recording at that point in the song - something that Vinyl did by announcing the time to the band through the studio intercom: \\"All right, time's up! Let's have you out of there!\\". However, Strummer felt the band was on fire with this take and spat his retort of \\"Ok, ok! Don't push us when we're hot!\\" in time to the rhythm. The band continued playing, with a take of three minutes and 50 seconds. Vinyl was worried that the band would be upset about him interrupting their perfect take, but the pre-planned interruption ended up adding to the charm of the recording.

The awards were on February 17, 2013 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, California. Although billed as the \\"3rd Annual\\", the awards have not actually been presented annually; the poorly received 2nd Streamy Awards were actually presented in March 2010 and was criticized for technical problems, interruptions and controversy; a three-year hiatus followed as the producers and organizers took time to regroup. The International Academy of Web Television, a partner in the 2010 event, chose to create its own awards ceremony for 2011, which continues to this day as a separate event from the Streamys. In the wake of the 2010 presentation, Tubefilter, the original co-creators of the Streamy Awards, partnered in 2011 with Dick Clark Productions, producers of the American Music Awards and other established entertainment industry awards shows, in an apparent effort to broaden the mainstream appeal and boost the credibility of the Streamy Awards. The founder of Nerdist Industries, Chris Hardwick, hosted the 2013 presentation. SourceFed created a video detailing that 19 of the 35 award winners were announced prior to the actual presentation. The show featured musical performances from Soulja Boy, Shontelle (featuring Lisa Lavie, Kurt Hugo Schneider, Sam Tsui, and Savannah Outen), Boyce Avenue, Vanilla Ice (featuring Epic Rap Battles of History, Mike Tompkins, and Chester See) Nominees The nominees were announced in a press release released on December 17, 2012.
