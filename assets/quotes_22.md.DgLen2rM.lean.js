It was launched in 2002, following the model of the Oxfam shop, and now operates over 100 stores across Korea. The volunteer- run store collects donations of old or worn-out items like clothing, books, bags, kitchenware and appliances, and sells them to raise money for charity. Beautiful Store also helps small businesses in developing countries by importing their products for fair prices, so that they can achieve financial self-reliance using the profit generated in this process. Activity Beautiful Store collects donations of old or worn-out items and then sells these donated items to raise money for charity. The material for recycling is given to the social improvement movement. From the beginning, Beautiful Store has accepted donations which are used, such as clothing, books, bags, shoes, kitchenware and appliances. Beautiful Store volunteers repair the items when needed and then they are distributed to the other stores. Beautiful Store operates a flea market to promote the culture of recycling, donation, and sharing. Instead of charging fees for the shop, Beautiful Store collects part of the sales profits as donation. Beautiful Store helps small businesses from developing countries by importing their products for fair prices. History In October 2002, Beautiful Store became a nonprofit organization operating independently as a subsidiary of Beautiful Foundation and opened the first branch. The following year on January 18, the Samseongyo store opened near Hansung Univ Station, consisting solely of volunteers except for the secretary (manager) of the operation. The following year a brown bamboo pencil case donated by President Roh Moo-hyun, before becoming president, was auctioned and raised 100 million won. Roh and his wife also donated pottery to the store. On 18 April 2003 the Dongnimmun branch was opened, the third branch of Beautiful Store. The Ttukseom flea market, which is held by Seoul Metropolitan Government and run by Beautiful Store, was opened on 27 March 2004; people can sell items in small quantities when they donate an item from their home. On June 9, 2008, it became an independent nonprofit corporation, Foundation Beautiful Store. References Further reading * .

The fundamental identities of the quadratic representation of a linear Jordan algebra are used as axioms to define a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field of arbitrary characteristic. There is a uniform description of finite-dimensional simple quadratic Jordan algebras, independent of characteristic. If 2 is invertible in the field of coefficients, the theory of quadratic Jordan algebras reduces to that of linear Jordan algebras. Definition A quadratic Jordan algebra consists of a vector space A over a field K with a distinguished element 1 and a quadratic map of A into the K-endomorphisms of A, a ↦ Q(a), satisfying the conditions: * Q(1) = id; * Q(Q(a)b) = Q(a)Q(b)Q(a) (\\"fundamental identity\\"); * Q(a)R(b,a) = R(a,b)Q(a) (\\"commutation identity\\"), where R(a,b)c = (Q(a + c) − Q(a) − Q(c))b. Further, these properties are required to hold under any extension of scalars.Racine (1973) p.1 Elements An element a is invertible if Q(a) is invertible and there exists b such that Q(b) is the inverse of Q(a) and Q(a)b = a: such b is unique and we say that b is the inverse of a. A Jordan division algebra is one in which every non-zero element is invertible. Structure Let B be a subspace of A. Define B to be a quadratic idealJacobson (1968) p.153 or an inner ideal if the image of Q(b) is contained in B for all b in B; define B to be an outer ideal if B is mapped into itself by every Q(a) for all a in A. An ideal of A is a subspace which is both an inner and an outer ideal. A quadratic Jordan algebra is simple if it contains no non-trivial ideals.Racine (1973) p.2 For given b, the image of Q(b) is an inner ideal: we call this the principal inner ideal on b.Jacobson (1968) p.154 The centroid Γ of A is the subset of EndK(A) consisting of endomorphisms T which \\"commute\\" with Q in the sense that for all a *T Q(a) = Q(a) T; *Q(Ta) = Q(a) T2. The centroid of a simple algebra is a field: A is central if its centroid is just K.Racine (1973) p.3 Examples =Quadratic Jordan algebra from an associative algebra= If A is a unital associative algebra over K with multiplication × then a quadratic map Q can be defined from A to EndK(A) by Q(a) : b ↦ a × b × a. This defines a quadratic Jordan algebra structure on A. A quadratic Jordan algebra is special if it is isomorphic to a subalgebra of such an algebra, otherwise exceptional. =Quadratic Jordan algebra from a quadratic form= Let A be a vector space over K with a quadratic form q and associated symmetric bilinear form q(x,y) = q(x+y) - q(x) - q(y). Let e be a \\"basepoint\\" of A, that is, an element with q(e) = 1. Define a linear functional T(y) = q(y,e) and a \\"reflection\\" y∗ = T(y)e - y. For each x we define Q(x) by :Q(x) : y ↦ q(x,y∗)x − q(x) y∗ . Then Q defines a quadratic Jordan algebra on A.Jacobson (1969) p.35Racine (1973) pp.5-6 =Quadratic Jordan algebra from a linear Jordan algebra= Let A be a unital Jordan algebra over a field K of characteristic not equal to 2. For a in A, let L denote the left multiplication map in the associative enveloping algebra :L(a) : x \\\\mapsto a x \\\\ and define a K-endomorphism of A, called the quadratic representation, by :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=2L(a)^2 -L(a^2).} Then Q defines a quadratic Jordan algebra. Quadratic Jordan algebra defined by a linear Jordan algebra The quadratic identities can be proved in a finite- dimensional Jordan algebra over R or C following Max Koecher, who used an invertible element. They are also easy to prove in a Jordan algebra defined by a unital associative algebra (a \\"special\\" Jordan algebra) since in that case Q(a)b = aba. See: * * They are valid in any Jordan algebra over a field of characteristic not equal to 2. This was conjectured by Jacobson and proved in : Macdonald showed that if a polynomial identity in three variables, linear in the third, is valid in any special Jordan algebra, then it holds in all Jordan algebras.See: * In an elementary proof, due to McCrimmon and Meyberg, is given for Jordan algebras over a field of characteristic not equal to 2. Koecher's proof Koecher's arguments apply for finite-dimensional Jordan algebras over the real or complex numbers.See: * * =Fundamental identity I= An element a in A is called invertible if it is invertible in R[a] or C[a]. If b denotes the inverse, then power associativity of a shows that L(a) and L(b) commute. In fact a is invertible if and only if Q(a) is invertible. In that case Indeed if Q(a) is invertible it carries R[a] onto itself. On the other hand Q(a)1 = a2, so :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)^{-1} a)a=a Q(a)^{-1} a=L(a)Q(a)^{-1}a=Q(a)^{-1}a^2 =1.} The Jordan identity :\\\\displaystyle{[L(a),L(a^2)](b)=0} can be polarized by replacing a by a + tc and taking the coefficient of t. Rewriting this as an operator applied to c yields :\\\\displaystyle{2L(ab)L(a) + L(a^2)L(b)=2L(a)L(b)L(a) + L(a^2b).} Taking b = a−1 in this polarized Jordan identity yields :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)L(a^{-1})=L(a).} Replacing a by its inverse, the relation follows if L(a) and L(a−1) are invertible. If not it holds for a + ε1 with ε arbitrarily small and hence also in the limit. For c in A and F(a) a function on A with values in End A, let DcF(a) be the derivative at t = 0 of F(a + tc). Then :\\\\displaystyle{c=D_c(Q(a)a^{-1})=2Q(a,c)a^{-1} +Q(a)D_c(a^{-1}),} where Q(a,b) if the polarization of Q :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a,c)={1\\\\over 2} (Q(a+c) -Q(a)-Q(c))=L(a)L(c) + L(c)L(a) - L(ac).} Since L(a) commutes with L(a−1) :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a,c)a^{-1}= (L(a)L(c) + L(c)L(a) - L(ac))a^{-1}=c.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{c=2c +Q(a)D_c(a^{-1}),} so that Applying Dc to L(a−1)Q(a) = L(a) and acting on b = c−1 yields :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)b)(Q(a^{-1})b^{-1})=1.} On the other hand L(Q(a)b) is invertible on an open dense set where Q(a)b must also be invertible with :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)b)^{-1}=Q(a^{-1})b^{-1}.} Taking the derivative Dc in the variable b in the expression above gives :\\\\displaystyle{-Q(Q(a)b)^{-1}Q(a)c =-Q(a)^{-1}Q(b)^{-1}c.} This yields the fundamental identity for a dense set of invertible elements, so it follows in general by continuity. The fundamental identity implies that c = Q(a)b is invertible if a and b are invertible and gives a formula for the inverse of Q(c). Applying it to c gives the inverse identity in full generality. =Commutation identity I= As shown above, if a is invertible, :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a,b)a^{-1} =b.} Taking Dc with a as the variable gives :\\\\displaystyle{0=Q(c,b)a^{-1} + Q(a,b)D_c(a^{-1})=Q(c,b)a^{-1} -Q(a,b)Q(a)^{-1}c.} Replacing a by a−1 gives, applying Q(a) and using the fundamental identity gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)Q(b,c)a= Q(a)Q(a^{-1},b)Q(a)c = \\\\frac{1}{2}Q(a)[Q(a^{-1}+b) -Q(a^{-1}) -Q(b)]Q(a)c = Q(Q(a)b,a)c.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)Q(b,c)a=Q(Q(a)b,a)c.} Interchanging b and c gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)Q(b,c)a=Q(a,Q(a)c)b.} On the other hand is defined by , so this implies :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)c=R(a,b)Q(a)c,} so that for a invertible and hence by continuity for all a Mccrimmon–Meyberg proof =Commutation identity II= The Jordan identity can be polarized by replacing a by a + tc and taking the coefficient of t. This gives :\\\\displaystyle{c(a^2b) + 2a (ac)b) = a^2(cb) + 2 (ac)(ab).} In operator notation this implies Polarizing in a again gives :\\\\displaystyle{c((ad)b) + d((ac)b) + a((dc)b)= (cd)(ab)+(da)(cb)+(ac)(db).} Written as operators acting on d, this gives :\\\\displaystyle{L(c)L(b)L(a) +L((ac)b) +L(a)L(b)L(c) = L(ab)L(c)+L(cb)L(a) +L(ac)L(b).} Replacing c by b and b by a gives Also, since the right hand side is symmetric in b and 'c, interchanging b and c on the left and subtracting , it follows that the commutators [L(b),L(c)] are derivations of the Jordan algebra. Let :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=2L(a)^2 - L(a^2).} Then Q(a) commutes with L(a) by the Jordan identity. From the definitions if is the associated symmetric bilinear mapping, then and :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a,b)=L(a)L(b)+L(b)L(a)-L(ab).} Moreover Indeed : By the second and first polarized Jordan identities this implies : The polarized version of is Now with , it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)=2[Q(a)L(b),L(a)] +2Q(a)L(ab)=2[Q(ab,a),L(a)] +2[L(a),L(b)]Q(a)+2Q(a)L(ab).} So by the last identity with ab in place of b this implies the commutation identity: :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)=2[L(a),L(b)]Q(a)+2L(ab)Q(a)=R(a,b)Q(a).} The identity Q(a)R(b,a) = R(a,b)Q(a) can be strengthened to Indeed applied to c, the first two terms give :\\\\displaystyle{2Q(a)Q(b,c)a=2Q(Q(a)c,a)b.} Switching b and c then gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)c=2Q(Q(a)b,a)c.} =Fundamental identity II= The identity is proved using the Lie bracket relations Indeed the polarization in c of the identity gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(c,y)L(x) +L(x)Q(c,y) = Q(yx,c) + Q(cx,y).} Applying both sides to d, this shows that :\\\\displaystyle{[L(x),R(c,d)]= R(xc,d) - R(c,xd).} In particular these equations hold for x = ab. On the other hand if T = [L(a),L(b)] then D(z) = Tz is a derivation of the Jordan algebra, so that :\\\\displaystyle{[T,R(c,d)] = R(Dc,d) + R(c,Dd).} The Lie bracket relations follow because R(a,b) = T + L(ab). Since the Lie bracket on the left hand side is antisymmetric, As a consequence Indeed set a = y, b = x, c = z, d = x and make both sides act on y. On the other hand Indeed this follows by setting x = Q(a)b in :\\\\displaystyle{[R(a,b),R(x,y)]a=- R(R(x,y)a,b)a +R(a,R(y,x)b)a.} Hence, combining these equations with the strengthened commutation identity, :\\\\displaystyle{2Q(Q(a)b)=2R(a,b)Q(Q(a)b,a)-R(b,a)Q(a)R(a,b) +2Q(a)Q(b)Q(a)=2Q(a)Q(b)Q(a).} Linear Jordan algebra defined by a quadratic Jordan algebra Let A be a quadratic Jordan algebra over R or C. Following , a linear Jordan algebra structure can be associated with A such that, if L(a) is Jordan multiplication, then the quadratic structure is given by Q(a) = 2L(a)2 − L(a2). Firstly the axiom Q(a)R(b,a) = R (a,b)Q(a) can be strengthened to :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)=R(a,b)Q(a)=2Q(Q(a)b,a).} Indeed applied to c, the first two terms give :\\\\displaystyle{2Q(a)Q(b,c)a=2Q(Q(a)c,a)b.} Switching b and c then gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)c=2Q(Q(a)b,a)c.} Now let :\\\\displaystyle{L(a)=\\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,1).} Replacing b by a and a by 1 in the identity above gives :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,1)=R(1,a)=2Q(a,1).} In particular :\\\\displaystyle{L(a)=Q(a,1),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,L(1)=Q(1,1)=I.} If furthermore a is invertible then :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,b)=2Q(Q(a)b,a)Q(a)^{-1}= 2Q(a)Q(b,a^{-1}).} Similarly if 'b is invertible :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,b)= 2Q(a,b^{-1})Q(b).} The Jordan product is given by :\\\\displaystyle{a\\\\circ b = L(a)b=\\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,1)b=Q(a,b)1,} so that :\\\\displaystyle{a\\\\circ b = b \\\\circ a.} The formula above shows that 1 is an identity. Defining a2 by a∘a = Q(a)1, the only remaining condition to be verified is the Jordan identity :\\\\displaystyle{[L(a),L(a^2)]=0.} In the fundamental identity :\\\\displaystyle{Q(Q(a)b)= Q(a)Q(b)Q(a),} Replace a by a + t, set b = 1 and compare the coefficients of t2 on both sides: :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=2Q(a,1)^2 - Q(a^2,1)= 2L(a)^2 - L(a^2).} Setting b = 1 in the second axiom gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)L(a)=L(a)Q(a),} and therefore L(a) must commute with L(a2). Shift identity In a unital linear Jordan algebra the shift identity asserts that Following , it can be established as a direct consequence of polarized forms of the fundamental identity and the commutation or homotopy identity. It is also a consequence of Macdonald's theorem since it is an operator identity involving only two variables.See: * * For a in a unital linear Jordan algebra A the quadratic representation is given by :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=2L(a)^2 - L(a^2),} so the corresponding symmetric bilinear mapping is :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a,b)=L(a)L(b)+L(b)L(a) -L(ab).} The other operators are given by the formula :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,b)=L(a)L(b) -L(b)L(a) +L(ab),} so that :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a,b)= 2L(a)L(b)-\\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,b).} The commutation or homotopy identity :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,b)Q(a)=Q(a)R(b,a)=2Q(Q(a)b,a),} can be polarized in a. Replacing a by a + t1 and taking the coefficient of t gives The fundamental identity :\\\\displaystyle{Q(Q(a)b)=Q(a)Q(b)Q(a)} can be polarized in a. Replacing a by a +t1 and taking the coefficients of t gives (interchanging a and b) Combining the two previous displayed identities yields Replacing a by a +t1 in the fundamental identity and taking the coefficient of t2 gives :\\\\displaystyle{2Q(Q(a)b,b)-L(a)Q(b)L(a)= Q(a)Q(b)+Q(b)Q(a) -Q(ab).} Since the right hand side is symmetric this implies These identities can be used to prove the shift identity: :\\\\displaystyle{R(Q(a)b,b)=R(a,Q(b)a).} It is equivalent to the identity :\\\\displaystyle{2L(Q(a)b)L(b)- Q(Q(a)b,b) = 2L(a)L(Q(b)a) -Q(a,Q(b)a).} By the previous displayed identity this is equivalent to :\\\\displaystyle{[L(Q(a)b)+L(b)Q(a)]L(b)= L(a)[L(Q(b)a) + Q(b)L(a)].} On the other hand the bracketed terms can be simplified by the third displayed identity. It implies that both sides are equal to . For finite-dimensional unital Jordan algebras, the shift identity can be seen more directly using mutations. Let a and b be invertible, and let be the Jordan multiplication in Ab. Then . Moreover . on the other hand and similarly with a and b interchanged. Hence :\\\\displaystyle{L_a(b^{2,a})Q(b) =Q(b)L_b(a^{2,b}).} Thus :\\\\displaystyle{R(Q(b)a,a)Q(b)=Q(b)R(Q(a)b,b)=R(b,Q(a)b)Q(b),} so the shift identity follows by cancelling Q(b). A density argument allows the invertibility assumption to be dropped. Jordan pairs A linear unital Jordan algebra gives rise to a quadratic mapping Q and associated mapping R satisfying the fundamental identity, the commutation of homotopy identity and the shift identity.

The building was originally built by the river Trebišnjica and moved in 1964 to the village Orah in the municipality of Bileća because its original location was flooded after hydro power plant near Bileća was completed in 1965.  History  The monastery was built on the foundations of earlier Christian basilica which was, according to the local legend, built by Constantine the Great and Helena. Slava of Dobrićevo Monastery is Presentation of Mary. The legend says that narthex was built after the main church building by members of the Aleksić family whose descendants still lived in nearby Oputna Rudina village at the beginning of the 20th century. During its history the monastery was destroyed or damaged many times. In 1672 it was burnt by the Ottomans. Ottomans again razed this monastery in 1687, after they were defeated and expelled from Herceg Novi. During the Herzegovina Uprising (1875–78) the monastery was again destroyed and robbed. On 5 August 1914 the monastery was seriously damaged by the soldiers of Austria-Hungary who put straw inside the church and burned it in order to destroy the frescoes. On that occasion many books and relics in the church were destroyed too, while only a part was saved by the monks. Near Dobrićevo Monastery was Kosijerevo Monastery, on another side of river Trebišnjica which today belongs to Montenegro. Like Dobrićevo, Kosijerevo monastery has also been moved to another location, to Petrovići village, near Nikšić in the region of Banjani tribe. The Dobrićevo Monastery was designated as a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006.

Darrac was one of the most important upholsterers of his generation. He was upholsterer for the French Court. He was first an apprentice of Michel-Jacques Boulard (1761-1825). Darrac's work can be found in the Chateau de Versailles. Darrac was also an inventor. In August 1812, he was granted a patent (Brevet d'invention) for five years for his new methods for upholstering furniture and his new method of producing a bed base. Darrac got his idea for his patent in Germany, where upholstered chairs and sofas were fitted with metal springs. He adapted them into his chairs and bed bases, thus creating the \\"sommier élastique\\" (French for bed base with elastic/spring suspension). The advantage of the bed base was that a much thinner mattresses could be produced, thus saving material. The bed base consisted of a combination of natural fillings and metal springs, thus enhancing the comfort. The invention initially saw limited commercial success, but it was later sold by a succession of several new owners under the name \\"Literie Darrac\\" in Paris, France.

Plot Monsieur St. Clair (Louis Jouvet), an aging romantic leading man, has decided to retire from the stage, but he is broke and goes to an old-age home for elderly actors. There he meets the other retired actors, all of whom know each other from having worked the same places over the years. One actor, Marny (Victor Francen), is a melancholy soul primarily because years ago his wife left him to have a fling with St. Clair and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. As an actor Marny was brilliant, but he never got the recognition he deserved, nor anything like the popularity of St. Clair. Cabrissade (Michel Simon), the third main protagonist of the film, is a prankster and free spirit who played mostly understudy roles during his career, and never even got the chance to star. Being actors they are each full of themselves in their own way. However, they are all equally dependent on this charitable retirement home for their support. Cabrissade, however, delights in defying the management's rules and playing practical jokes on both staff and residents alike. Unknown to him or any resident, the retirement home is nearly bankrupt, and the management plans to close it. A 17 year old local barmaid becomes infatuated with St. Clair, who woos her the way he has wooed many others before. However, she sees St. Clair only as a famous romantic and not the pompous self-absorbed has-been that he really is. Marny, her platonic friend, burns as he watches the girl fall under St. Clair's spell. However, when St. Clair comes into some money he leaves her behind and goes to Monte Carlo to blow it all. As the retirement home slides downhill, privileges like electricity after 9pm and evening wine are suspended, which prompts Cabrissade to lead a revolt of the residents against the management. But as they express their demands for better treatment, the director informs them that the home will be closing and each will be split up and transferred to other homes. This is frightening to this group of actors who really have nothing in common with ordinary folk. One couple who have been together for 35 years decide to marry as it will ensure they can stay together. The wedding takes place and at the party afterword the director announces that he has succeeded in obtaining financing to keep the home open. It is decided to put on a play for the new benefactors. St. Clair returns home broke and immediately begins to entice the young barmaid again. His ego is stroked as she professes that she would die for him. He presses her to prove her love, and a plan is made. The play goes on, and it is demanded that Marny play the lead role—a role which Cabrissade longs to perform. Cabrissade appeals to Marny to allow him to play the role, but Marny scoffs at the idea. As the pleading becomes more intense there is a tussle and Marny falls unconscious. Cabrissade dresses himself in Marny's costume and takes the stage. However, immediately upon seeing the audience he is struck by stage fright and cannot say his lines. The production stops and Cabrissade is deeply humiliated. Later, Marny performs the part. Cabrissade realizes he has been fooling himself all his life, and in despair dies. St. Clair goes to the bar to find the barmaid and get her to commit suicide to prove to himself that he has such power over women—even at his age. However, Marny is there already, discussing how the play went once it resumed. As he speaks with St. Clair he begins to realize what she is about to do and rushes upstairs to stop her. There is a shot, but no one has been hit. Marny is now unspeakably angry with St. Clair for nearly causing another person to die like his ex-wife. However, when he comes back downstairs St. Clair has descended into madness, performing scenes from Don Juan as if he were living them right there. St. Clair is sent to an asylum. Marny reads a eulogy for Cabrissade written by Cabrissade himself. Marny bites his lip as he gushes over the great talents of Cabrissade until he cannot go any further. At that point, he speaks from the heart about Cabrissade's love and loyalty to the theater and his nobility at following this path.

This is asia's first sloth bear Sanctuary. It is spread over . The sanctuary was created exclusively for the preservation of the sloth bear. It is about 50 km from Ballari and about 15 km from the World Heritage Site Hampi. The area between Daroji in Sandur taluka and Ramasagar of Hospet Taluk is host to numerous sloth bears. In October 1994, the Government of Karnataka, declared 5587.30 hectares of the Bilikallu Forest Reserve as Daroji Bear Sanctuary. 15 years later, in October 2009, the government added 2685.50 hectares of the Bukkasagara Forest Reserve to the sanctuary. This resulted in the overall area to increase from 5587.3 hectares to 8272.8 hectares. The sanctuary is open between 14:00 and 18:00 every day. There is a watchtower within the sanctuary, opposite Karadikallu Gudda, that provides a vantage point to view the bears descending from the adjacent hillocks during evening hours. Mythology Kishkindha, the mythical kingdom of Sugriva described in the Ramayana, is believed to be located on the bank of the Tungabhadra river. In the war against Ravana, Kishkinda, the monkey kingdom of Sugriva, was Rama’s ally. When Rama’s army crossed Hampi en route to Lanka, they met Jambavantha, a bear who joined the army. Flora & Fauna The flora of this sanctuary is primarily dry deciduous scrub and Southern thorn forests. At the time of declaration of the sanctuary, it was a large area of barren hillocks, but persistent efforts from Karnataka Forest Department have transformed the area into lush green forest, filled with local flora. The sanctuary's flagship species is the Indian sloth bear (Melursus ursinus). It has a very stable population of sloth bears and they reside in the numerous caves found in the hillocks within the sanctuary. leopards, monitor lizards, mongoose, pangolins, star tortoises etc. are some of the other animals that abound in the sanctuary. Threats The bears are threatened due to illegal mining in fragmented areas of the adjoining forests. The forest department and NGOs have also rescued many domestic bears from Daroji and surrounding areas. The age old practice of capturing a bear cub (claws are pulled out and male cubs are castrated) and domestication by Kalandars has reduced to a great extent, due to laws declaring them illegal. The domesticated bears were taken from home to home across villages and made to dance according to the direction of the Kalandars.

The design guidelines do not separate the genders in the district. The KAFD master plan was designed and overseen by Danish architectural firm Henning Larsen Architects. International architecture firms such as HOK, Omrania, SOM, CallisonRTKL, Gensler, and Foster + Partners were commissioned to design individual buildings in the district, such as the 380-meter PIF Tower (HOK and Omrania). Additional design work was provided by W Architecture and Landscape Architecture. The CEO of the development is Waleed Aleisa. The project was at one point estimated to cost 29 billion Saudi riyals ($7.8 billion). Upon completion, KAFD is expected to host round 50,000 residents. As Riyadh is characterized by its high temperature, a solar system will be installed to cool the passenger bridges that are going to act as a network that connects 30 building together. KAFD Grand Mosque designed by Omrania The project is considered to be long over due and needed for a city of the size and position of Riyadh. The key issue with the project was timing as it was announced and incepted during the 2008 financial crisis. A number of local and international commentators highlighted the potential oversupply issue with the project. However, others, such as Hans Mueller in Saudi Real Estate Companion, believe that the market will be able to absorb the supply in the medium term. The first phase was expected to open by July 2017.

The house was restored in 1929. The \\"Woodstock\\" house stands at the highest point of the park. From this height can be seen the Delaware and Christina Rivers and their surrounding marshes. The house is of brick, with a two-story east wing said to have been built in 1743, and a two-and-one half story west wing built-in 1833. The addition of porches (front, side, and rear) and a kitchen shed during the 1930s are the only modern changes. On the roof of the newer and taller wing is a \\"widow's walk\\" surrounded by a balustrade. Two sheds attached to the eastern wing are old but cannot be dated. Granite hitching posts and a mounting block stand near the entrance. The inside of the building presents contrast between its 18th and 19th century sections. The older section has rough-finished walls and low ceiling. The newer section is more refined, indicating not only the passage of one hundred years, but also the increased fortunes of the owners. On the lower floor of the 1743 wing is located the kitchen/parlor of the original building. A winding staircase leads to the floor above, and there is a root cellar underneath. A Dutch oven with original hardware and wrought iron door can be found in the fireplace of this room. The hardware in both sections is original. On the westerly side of the main floor in the newer section can be found large nine-over-nine windows. These rooms are distinctive for their imported marble fireplaces and original wood trim and hardware. The larger section features a side-hall, double-pile plan. The classic stairwell and broad passageways add to the spacious feeling of the interior. The second floor also contains handsome fireplaces, but made with wooden mantels. The one-half story above the newer section also contains two rooms which are notable for their inside shutters. Behind a doorway in the hall is a stairway leading to the second attic and the \\"widow's walk.\\" Tradition states that one of Delaware's most famous ghosts still lives in \\"Woodstock,\\" haunting on the full moon and leaving signs of his tragic death at the foot of the stairs. 156 acres of parkland comprise the present-day Banning Park. This is the last remaining intact plantation^ property along the Christina River. The land title can be traced back through records to approximately l659, when the Swede Andries Andriessen settled on the north bank of the Christina. The property changed hands several times until 1687 when John Richardson, a Quaker merchant from New Castle, purchased the property. Richardson planned to develop a milling community under the name of Middleburg, or Middleboro. It is believed that his son, John Richardson, II, lived on or near the property from about 1704. Richardson II, built a new and larger house further up on the hill at the present site of \\"Woodstock.\\" The exact date of this new house is not known; however, we do know he built an addition in 1743, as he referred to it in his will of 1752. This addition is thought to be the smaller east wing of the present building. The older section, built between 1704 and 1743 was torn down in 1833 when the present main house was built. John Richardson II, and his several brothers developed on the northern bank of the Christina a series of mills, farming properties, and warehouses and docks. John Richardson II, passed on the property to John Richardson IV, his grandson. Since John Richardson, IV, left no will, the property went to Ann, daughter of John II. She married Dr Henry Latimer in 1779. Dr. Latimer was an active participant in the Revolution and a central figure in early Delaware politics. The Latimers were often guests of Presidents Adams and Jefferson, and \\"Woodstock\\" was the center of society and influence along the Christina. The home and farm were passed on intact through the Latimer family to James Latimer Banning. Previous to his acquiring the property, \\"Woodstock\\" had remained vacant for some time. In 1929 Mr. Banning and his wife, Jane E. Gray Banning, set about restoring it. and It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The Woodstock house is currently occupied as part of a resident curator ship program run by New Castle County.

It is located in Taepyeongno, Jung-gu, the heart of Seoul. It's located in front of Seoul City Hall and next to the City Hall Station on Seoul Subway Line 1. In front of the Metropolitan Library is Seoul Plaza. History The building was first built by the Governor-General of Korea in 1926 during the Japanese occupation. Registered as Cultural Heritage No. 52, initially was used as the headquarters of the governor-general of Korea. At the end of the Third Battle of Seoul in 1951 during the Korean War, communist Chinese and North Korean troops fought successfully in chasing out US and UN forces out of the city before marching through ruined Seoul to the building and then planting a North Korean flag on its roof, carried out by a Chinese PVA platoon. The city hall was expanded 6 times. The main building is a designated registered cultural property of the Republic of Korea. The North building was built in 1962 and the new building in 1986. Both were demolished in 2006 to make way for a new city hall construction. Original plans called for the historic building to be razed and replaced with a new design, but support for preservation put a halt to demolition. The Cultural Properties Committee, under the Cultural Heritage Administration, registered the building as a historic relic. Eventually, a compromise was reached, preserving the front building facing Seoul Plaza, and allowing construction of a modern building behind the old one. A large digital clock for the building was installed in 1975, and replaced with an analogue counterpart when Lee Myung-bak was mayor of Seoul. Following the competition for a new city hall, the building was reconstructed and reopened as library.

Such memories require each object instance to be uniquely identified and this ID to be attached to the physical object. The underlying techniques to create identification codes and to attach them to objects are manifold but machine-readable techniques are mandatory. Commonly used are barcodes with one or two dimensions (e.g. QRcode or DataMatrix) and radio based tags like RFID or NFC. Such codes or tags are a low cost solution but demand an underlying server infrastructure to host the memory data. A taxonomy of Digital Object Memories (DOMe)  Active digital object memories  In contrast to the mentioned memories providing only a passive storage space, the more sophisticated active digital object memories (ADOMe) are based on embedded systems in terms of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and provide on the hardware side * a microprocessor, * memory, * microsensor systems, * positioning chips, * radio modules for web connectivity, * possibly actuators, * its own energy supply or energy-harvesting unit and on the software side there are * memory management functions, * sensor interpretation components, * and possibly sensor fusion software modules, * state transformation and processing logic components, * communication interfaces, * user interfaces, * and security modules. Such active memories allow for \\"on-object\\" processing of object-related tasks, such as condition monitoring, compilation of associated data, and memory clean-up. In addition to strictly passive memories (storage space is located in the web as mentioned above) and active memories (with \\"on- object\\" storage) hybrid forms are also available, that perform simple tasks \\"on-product\\", outsource more complex tasks to server-based infrastructures, and keep both representations in sync.  Digital product memory  Digital product memories (DPM) are a subclass of digital object memories, which include memories for all artifacts that were intentionally created such as containers and pieces of art or valuable and rare natural objects such as a marble plate or a lump of gold. Such objects don't have all the attributes of industrial products, but nevertheless a digital black box attached to them for lifelogging can make sense for specific applications.  Semantic product memory  Semantic product memories (SemProM) go beyond that, since they provide a machine-understandable meaning description of their contents based on semantic web technologies. If a product memory has no explicit semantic markup, only propriety software can exploit the information stored in the memory. In contrast, semantic product memories can be interpreted by any software that has access to the semantic description of the epistemological primitives and the ontologies used for capturing memory contents.  Object memory model  In the context of the Object Memory Modeling Incubator Group,OMM XG part of the W3C Incubator Activity, an object memory format, which allows for modeling of events or other information about individual physical artifacts (ideally over their lifetime) and thus implements an object memory model (OMM), was created. The model consists of a block-based approach to partition the entire memory to groups each with associated object-related information. Each block consists of the data itself (the so-called payload) and a set of metadata attributes to describe the block content.  Related research projects   SemProM  Funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research, the project SemProM (Semantic Product Memoryhttp://www.semprom.org/) employs smart labels in order to give products a digital memory and thus support intelligent applications along the product's lifecycle. By the use of integrated sensors, relations in the production process become transparent and supply chains as well as environmental influences retraceable. The producer gets supported and the consumer better informed about the product.  RES-COM  Funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research, the project RES-COM (Resource Conservation by Context- Activated Machine-to-Machine Communicationhttp://www.res-com-project.org/) focuses on the development of technologies (containing interfaces, protocols and data models) for proactive resource conservation based on M2M-communication. With a defined interaction with active digital object memories the project tries to leverage the integration of distributed and active components to existing centralized structures in the field of industry and manufacturing.  Aletheia  The Aletheia projecthttp://www.aletheia- projekt.de/ is a leading innovation project, sponsored by the German Ministry of Education and Research that aims at obtaining comprehensive access to product information through the use of semantic technologies. The project follows an approach which does not only consult structured data from company- owned information sources, such as product databases, to respond to inquiries, it also looks at unstructured data from office documents and web 2.0 sources, such as wikis, blogs, and internet forums, as well as sensor and RFID data.  ADiWa  The ADiWa project (Alliance Digital Product Flowhttp://www.adiwa.net/), funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research, makes the huge potential of information from the Internet of Things accessible for business-relevant workflows that can be strategically planned and manipulated. For the data-level connection of objects from the real world, results from available solutions and from the SemProM project shall be used. ADiWa focuses on business processes, which can be controlled and manipulated based on evaluated information from the real world.  SmartProducts  The SmartProducts project, funded by the European Union in the 7th Research Framework Programme (FP7), develops the scientific and technological basis for building \\"smart products\\" with embedded proactive knowledge. Smart products help customers, designers and workers to deal with the ever-increasing complexity and variety of modern products. Such smart products leverage proactive knowledge to communicate and co-operate with humans, other products and the environment. The project thereby also focuses on small devices with limited storage capabilities and thus also requires efficient storage mechanisms. Moreover, the project aims to apply the results achieved by the incubator group for optimizing the data exchange between different smart products.  ToTEM  Tales of Things and electronic Memory (TOTeM) is a three-year collaborative project between five universities in the United Kingdom. A project aim is to explore the implications of Internet of Things technologies for the design of novel forms of augmented memory systems. While the potential implications of the Internet of Things for supply chain management and energy consumption have been acknowledged and discussed, its application for the engagement with personal and social memories has been rarely mentioned. More and more newly manufactured objects are often tagged at production and made traceable. Tales of Things provides a design space for exploring the value of a user-generated Internet of Old Things in which people's memories are linked to objects.  SmaProN  The project Smart Product Networks (SmaProNhttp://iss.uni-saarland.de/de/projects/smapron), funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research, explores the dynamic linking of smart products to product bundles and product hierarchies, based on the developed Tip'n'Tell architecture (to integrate distributed product information) and the product description model SPDO (using semantic web-based representation languages).  RAN  The project RFID-Based Automotive Network (RANhttp://www.autoran.de/), founded by the German Ministry of Education and Research, focuses on the development of a RFID-based hybrid control architecture and valuation methods for value added chains. Using the example of automobile industry they develop a combined data management that exchanges product-related information in a decentralized way using RFID-tags. In addition order-related information are stored in centralized manufacturer databases. Such an architecture allows for transport of product-related data at the location of the physical object and process related data in real-time via backend systems.

A relictual population is a population that currently occurs in a restricted area, but whose original range was far wider during a previous geologic epoch. Similarly, a relictual taxon is a taxon (e.g. species or other lineage) that is the sole surviving representative of a formerly diverse group. Definition A relict (or relic) plant or animal is a taxon that persists as a remnant of what was once a diverse and widespread population. Relictualism occurs when a widespread habitat or range changes and a small area becomes cut off from the whole. A subset of the population is then confined to the available hospitable area, and survives there while the broader population either shrinks or evolves divergently. This phenomenon differs from endemism in that the range of the population was not always restricted to the local region. In other words, the species or group did not necessarily arise in that small area, but rather was stranded, or insularized, by changes over time. The agent of change could be anything from competition from other organisms, continental drift, or climate change such as an ice age. Examples A notable example is the thylacine of Tasmania, a relict marsupial carnivore that survived into modern times on an island whereas the rest of its species on mainland Australia had gone extinct between 3000 and 2000 years ago. When a relict is representative of taxa found in the fossil record, and yet is still living, such an organism is sometimes referred to as a living fossil. However, a relict need not be currently living. An evolutionary relict is any organism that was characteristic of the flora or fauna of one age and that persisted into a later age, with the later age being characterized by newly evolved flora or fauna significantly different from those that came before. Another example is Omma, a genus of beetle with a fossil record extending back over 200 million years to the Late Triassic and found worldwide during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, now confined to a single living species in Australia. An example from the fossil record would be a specimen of Nimravidae, an extinct branch of carnivores in the mammalian evolutionary tree, if said specimen came from Europe in the Miocene epoch. If that was the case, the specimen would represent, not the main population, but a last surviving remnant of the nimravid lineage. These carnivores were common and widespread in the previous epoch, the Oligocene, and disappeared when the climate changed and woodlands were replaced by savanna. They persisted in Europe in the last remaining forests as a relict of the Oligocene: a relict species in a relict habitat. An example of divergent evolution creating relicts is found in the shrews of the islands off the coast of Alaska, namely the Pribilof Island shrew and the St. Lawrence Island shrew. These species are apparently relicts of a time when the islands were connected to the mainland, and these species were once conspecific with a more widespread species, now the cinereus shrew, the three populations having diverged through speciation. In botany, an example of an ice age relict plant population is the Snowdon lily, notable as being precariously rare in Wales. The Welsh population is confined to the north- facing slopes of Snowdonia, where climatic conditions are apparently similar to ice age Europe. Some have expressed concern that the warming climate will cause the lily to die out in Great Britain. Other populations of the same plant can be found in the Arctic and in the mountains of Europe and North America, where it is known as the common alplily. A well-studied botanical example of a relictual taxon is Ginkgo biloba, the last living representative of Ginkgoales that is restricted to China in the wild. Ginkgo trees had a diverse and widespread northern distribution during the Mesozoic, but are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene other than G. biloba. The Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis) is an endemic subspecies, a relict of last ice age that lives only in Finland in the landlocked and fragmented Saimaa freshwater lake complex. Nowadays the population has less than 400 individuals, which poses a threat to its survival. Another example is the relict leopard frog once found throughout Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Colorado but now only found at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada and Arizona Relevance The concept of relictualism is useful in understanding the ecology and conservation status of populations that have become insularized, meaning confined to one small area or multiple small areas with no chance of movement between populations. Insularization makes a population vulnerable to forces that can lead to extinction, such as disease, inbreeding, habitat destruction, competition from introduced species, and global warming. Consider the case of the white-eyed river martin, a very localized species of bird found only in Southeast Asia, and extremely rare, if not already extinct. Its closest and only surviving living relative is the African river martin, also very localized in central Africa. These two species are the only known members of the subfamily Pseudochelidoninae, and their widely disjunct populations suggest they are relict populations of a more common and widespread ancestor. Known to science only since 1968, it seems to have disappeared. Studies have been done on relict populations in isolated mountain and valley habitats in western North America, where the basin and range topography creates areas that are insular in nature, such as forested mountains surrounded by inhospitable desert, called sky islands. Such situations can serve as refuges for certain Pleistocene relicts, such as Townsend's pocket gopher, while at the same time creating barriers for biological dispersal. Studies have shown that such insular habitats have a tendency toward decreasing species richness. This observation has significant implications for conservation biology, because habitat fragmentation can also lead to the insularization of stranded populations.

It is located in Mansehra District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, about 45 kilometers east of the Indus River and 156 kilometers from Islamabad, in the lower Pakhal Valley. It is the de facto headquarters of the Swati tribe and the second most populous village in the Pakhal Valley. Khawajgan is bordered on the east by the village of Sherpur; on the west by Janglat, the Meadows of Ajmer, and Chorgali; on the north by Muradpur (Najjha), the Jageer area, Tatar, and Gidarpur; and on the south by the city of Mansehra. The main language is Pashto, with pockets of Hindko. Small minorities speak Urdu and English. History Khawajgan was built as a small Pashtun village approximately 500 years ago. The area may once have been inhabited by Hindus and Turks, before the Swati tribe invaded. The date of the invasion is not known. The people of Khawajgan are members of the Swati tribe, from the Sarkhailee, Mamyati, and Matrawi clans. The tribe first settled in Tajikistan. From there, they migrated to Afghanistan, then to the Swat Valley, and then to the Pakhal Valley. The Swatis who invaded were descendants of Batu Khail Balghandar Khan, a descendant of Ali Sher Khan, son of Sultan Mitra Khan-Matrawi. Later, Inayat Ullah Khan rebuilt Khawajgan at its current location, at a high altitude with an abundance of water from a nearby stream for drinking and farming. Khawajgan is a federation of a number of small taluqas, or villages, including Landai, Bhatain, Shanai, Skandara, Dagai, Golroo Maira, Baila, and Bandi Sheikhan. Education Since independence, Khawajgan has seen a significant improvement in education and educational facilities, although the standards are fairly low in government-funded schools compared with those in the rest of the country. The literacy rate among residents 10 or older is just under 50 percent; it has increased by 34 percent since 1981. The male literacy rate is higher, at 60.5 percent. There are separate educational institutes for girls and boys, as well as co-educational institutes. However, most families with children move to Mansehra or Abbottabad for schooling. Some of the educational institutes in Khawajgan are: *Government Primary School for Boys *Government Middle School for Girls *Muslim Public High School *National Model Public School Economy Khawajgan is largely an agricultural area. The major crops are wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, maize, rice, rapeseed, mustard, and various vegetables, including both kharif and rabi crops. Important fruits are oranges, plums, peaches, apricots, pears, and apples. The past 10 years have seen major improvements in education, health, and infrastructure. Large-scale poultry farming and manufacturing based on agricultural material have grown, as has the financial sector. National banks have opened branches in the village center, and the population is growing rapidly. Climate The summer season in Khawajgan is hot: Temperatures rise steeply from May to June, reaching a peak of 41.5 °C on average, and remain high through July, August, and September. During May and June, dust storms are frequent. Starting in October, temperatures fall rapidly. The coldest months are December and January, with a mean minimum temperature of 2.1 °C in January. Most rainfall occurs in July, August, December and January. The maximum rainfall is 125.85 mm in August. Toward the end of the cold-weather season, there are occasional thunderstorms and hail storms. The relative humidity is high throughout the year, reaching a maximum of 73.33% in December. Flora and fauna Common trees in Khawajgan are mesquite, ber, acacia, eucalyptus, safeda, pine, and cedar. The village has a variety of fauna, including the jackal, goat, and pheasant. Russian doves migrate through the area and are a target of hunters, as locals like their meat. Food Popular foods in the village include rice, beef cooked as chapli kebab, seekh kebab, tikka, and kahwa (green tea). Tandoor ovens for baking bread are present in many homes. Dwellings The village is divided into kandis based on the pattern of agricultural lands. The houses generally consist of two or three rooms, a courtyard, and outdoor accommodations for cattle and poultry. Each kandi has its own mosque and a meeting place called a hujra, commonly used for business and to settle public disputes. In most cases, hujras are the property of the kandi's elders, who are expected to feed and give shelter to visitors. The best-known hujra in Khawajgan, open to travelers 365 days a year, is Naberdar saib Hujra. Many houses in Khawajgan lack compound walls because they are immediately adjacent to one another, separated by gates.

The Mahango Game Park (also known as the Mahango Game Reserve) is a protected area in Namibia within Bwabwata National Park. It is situated at the country's eastern border with Botswana in the flood plains of the Okavango River basin, close to the Popa Falls on the river. The Caprivi Strip encloses the western part of the park. It was established in 1986 and covers an area of . With over 300 species of birds, it has been designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. About two thirds of the bird species found in Namibia are located here as it includes both wetland and tropical terrestrial species of birds. Geography Okavango River through the park The park is located in the western end of the Caprivi Strip and forms part of the large flood plains of the Okavango River basin in north-eastern Namibia between Andara Mission bordering Botswana. Topography of the park is in the elevation range of 500 - 1,000m. The Okavango Swamps starts from this park area and is known as the panhandle region. The Okavango River flows into Botswana forming the Okavango Delta in that country. The park is subject to a dry season lasting from April to November and the rainy season from mid- November to April. The annual rainfall incidence varies between 550 and 600 mm and 80% of it occurs during the rainy season. The monthly average maximum temperature is reported as 30 °C. Flora Vegetation consists of 38% shrubland and 62% grass land. Riparian forests are an important form of dense vegetation against the dry woodlands in the higher reaches of the river valley and reed beds, swamps, and open flooded grasslands of the flood plains. In view of this varying vegetational pattern, the park is rich in flora; with a reported 869 species from 88 families. The important riparian woodland species are Garcinia, Sclerocarya, Diospyros, Acacia and Grewia. The species reported from the desert areas are Pterocarpus, Ricinodendron, Ziziphus, Baikiaea and shrubs of Baphia. The flood plains have Phoenix and baobab (Adansonia); the baobab trees in the park are very large. One of the more commonly found trees in the park is the baobab. Fauna It has very rich diversity of mammal species; 99 species are reported, including elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs, and hippopotami. Some of the key species which are under the threatened list are Lycaon pictus pictus (EN), Loxodonta africana (VU), Kobus leche, and Lutra maculicollis (VU) found mostly in aquatic environment; Loxodonta africana and Kobus leche also migrate to neighboring countries. There are 71 aqua faunal species and five species of amphibians such as Phrynomantis affinis. Avifauna The avifaunal species consists of wetland birds such as Egretta vinaceigula, Bugeranus carunculatus, Ardeola rufiventris, Pelecanus rufescens, Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis, Microparra capensis, Vanellus albiceps, Vanellus crassirostris, Glareola pratincola, Macronyx ameliae and Circus pygargus. In the riverine habitat, the bird species of importance are Glareola nuchalis and Rynchops flavirostris, and in the fringing riparian vegetation Scotopelia peli and Gorsachius leuconotus species have been recorded.

It published numerous daily newspapers and weekly journals. Taken over by the Germans during World War II, the company's assets became the cornerstone of the Nowy Kurier Warszawski propaganda newspaper. After the war the Dom Prasy's assets became the foundation of several modern newspapers, including Życie Warszawy.  Company  The company was founded in 1922 as a private venture. The titles and mastheads of most titles were printed in red, which gained the company a popular nickname of Czerwona prasa or Koncern Czerwonej Prasy – the Red Press Concern. In the 1930s the company published and printed numerous daily newspapers: Kurier Czerwony, Expres Poranny, Dobry Wieczór - Kurier Czerwony and Dzień Dobry. In addition, the company also published numerous weeklies, including Panorama 7 dni, Cyrulik Warszawski, Kino and Przegląd Sportowy. In 1934 the company was taken over by the government of Poland and since then most of its titles became supportive of the ruling Sanacja regime. In 1939, following the Nazi and Soviet Invasion of Poland, all Polish newspapers were disbanded by the German authorities and the company ceased to exist. Its assets were taken over by the German propaganda Nowy Kurier Warszawski, the largest newspaper in German-occupied Poland. In 1945 the assets of the former Dom Prasy were not returned to the owners. Instead, they were nationalised by the Ministry of Information and Propaganda and donated to the Czytelnik printing house. The new owners rebuilt the building in 1951 and started publishing new newspapers there: Życie Warszawy, Rzeczpospolita and Wieczór. Later that year all titles were taken over by the RSW Prasa cooperative, who continued to use the venue of the former Dom Prasy until 1992.  Building  Marszałkowska Street in Warsaw The building commonly referred to as \\"Dom Prasy\\" was originally built between 1890 and 1892 on a triangular plot of land between Marszałkowska and Polna Str., at the southern outskirts of Warsaw, close to the Pole Mokotowskie. The main building, designed for the Bender carpet factory (in 1908 renamed to Warszawska Akcyjna Fabryka Dywanów – Warsaw Carpet Factory Stock Company), occupied the entire length of the Polna street side, with a smaller reception building constructed along Marszałkowska. Because of that it received a dual address: Marszałkowska 3/5 and Polna 4/6. Nearby, at Marszałkowska 8 (Polna 8) a three-story administrative building was constructed. The carpet factory went bankrupt in 1915, after Warsaw had been cut off from its main markets in Imperial Russia by the frontlines of World War I. In 1927 both buildings were acquired by the Dom Prasy media corporation. Refurbished and rebuilt as a modernist office and printing press building by Maksymilian Goldberg and Hipolit Rutkowski, it became the largest printing press in Warsaw. The main building was extended by one level. The cellars were converted into a boiler station and depots. The ground floor was occupied by the printing press, while upper floors by headquarters of various journals and magazines owned by the Dom Prasy Co. Dom Prasy Co. owned the building until its dissolution by the German authorities in 1939. The building survived World War II and the Warsaw uprising, although it was completely burned-out. Modernised in 1951, its reception building along Marszałkowska Street was extended to span the entire length of the plot. At the same time the administrative building was demolished around 1951. The main building continued to serve as the printing press of numerous press titles (notably the Kurier Warszawski and Życie Warszawy – until 1992), with the lower reception building leased to various businesses. In 2011 the building was put on the Registry of Historical Landmarks.

It was built for Nathaniel Rawlins, a London haberdasher merchant, who lived there until his death in 1718. The Duke of Clarence, later to become King William IV, lived in Richmond in the late 1780s and gave his name to the property. From 1792 to 1799, Clarence House was a Catholic school run by Timothy Eeles. Among the students was Bernardo O’Higgins. O'Higgins is commemorated on the wall of the property with a blue plaque installed by English Heritage, for his role in the Chilean War of Independence.The plaque, installed in July 1994, reads: \\"Bernardo O'Higgins, 1778–1842, General, Statesman and Liberator of Chile, lived and studied here\\". The building was used as a warehouse by Fortnum & Mason from 1941 to 1947. They had planned in 1943 to tear the building down and replace it with a commercial development. A private dwelling since 1947, it was owned by the actor Brian Blessed from 1967 to 1976. In 2012 the house was offered for sale, with an asking price of £22.5m.

Russian chronicles record that King Mengu-Timur and Metropolitan Kirill sent Sarai Bishop Theognostus to the Emperor Michael VIII and the Patriarch of Constantinople as their joint envoy with letters and gifts from each of them. This embassy was probably held around 1278, as Theognostus returned to Sarai in 1279. It appears that relations with Egypt were also discussed by Theognostus with the emperor and the patriarch. Anyway, at about the same time, Meng-Timur tried to establish direct diplomatic ties with Egypt through Constantinople. Prior to 1251 was close to Prince Daniel of Galicia (Danylo Halytskyi). In 1246 on the road to Nicaea he was negotiating with the Hungarian King Bela IV, which resulted in the marriage of a Hungarian princess to Daniel Galitsky. Around 1251 Kirill left Daniel Galitsky, who in 1254 received the royal crown from the Pope. In 1251, he went to Novgorod, where he first met with Alexander Nevsky. Since 1251 Kirill almost continuously resided in the north-east of Russia, working closely with Prince Alexander Nevsky, constantly traveling around the country. In 1252, Alexander Nevsky became a ruler of Vladimir instead of his brother Andrew Yaroslavich, and the Metropolitan solemnly met Alexander Nevsky, who returned from the Horde, and supported his reign. Prince Alexander Nevsky and Kirill chose to recognise Mongol domination, and opposed Western Catholic expansion. Church Around 1252 Cyril received a charter from Batu Khan, which guaranteed the inviolability of the Orthodox Church. A charter of 1267, issued by Berke Khan, has been authentically preserved. In 1258 he founded the bishopric in Tver. In 1261, with the assistance of Alexander Nevsky, an Orthodox diocese was founded in Sarai. In 1274 a council of bishops of the Russian Church was held in Vladimir, with the aim to order and restore the ecclesiastical legislation. In 1279, Khan Meng-Timur issued a charter that defended the faith and the sanctity of the rights of clergy from abuse by Mongol officials. Kirill appointed bishops to Vladimir, Rostov and Sarai. Kirill died in Pereslavl-Zalessky, Grand Duchy of Vladimir and Suzdal. At first his body was moved to Vladimir, but later to Kiev where he was buried on a territory of the Sophia Cathedral compound.

Early life, study and work Hermann Jansen was born in 1869 was the son of the pastry chef Francis Xavier Jansen and his wife Maria Anna Catharina Arnoldi. After visiting the humanistic Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium in Aachen, Jansen studied architecture at the RWTH Aachen University in Karl Henrici (de). After graduation in 1893, Jansen worked in an architectural office in Aachen. 1897 drew Jansen to Berlin, and in 1899 created his own business with the architect William Mueller (de). In the same year he made the designs for the later-named Pelzer tower (de) in his home town of Aachen. In 1903 he took over the publication of the architecture magazine \\"The Builder\\" (1903–1916), which was first published in 1902 in Munich. \\"Greater Berlin\\" and the General Town Planning Exhibition In the years prior to 1908, the District of Berlin and its surrounding towns and cities had witnessed immense growth due to private investment. Due to the unplanned nature of growth in the city, several key urban challenges surfaced. These included the provision of housing, capacity for efficient transport, and the demand for public open spaces. With pressures mounting, the city saw planning a means of directing growth, and in 1908 put forth the ‘Groẞ-Berlin' (Greater Berlin) competition. The competition required planners and architects to put forth design that would link central Berlin with surrounding towns in the regions to form a metropolis, spanning from the historic center to outer suburbs. Jansen was among the planners who submitted a comprehensive plan for a Greater Berlin, and when the competition closed in 1910 his was awarded equal first place. Jansen's proposal, later dubbed \\"The Jansen-plan\\" stood as the first comprehensive plan ever to be commissioned for Greater Berlin. Under the Jansen plan, development of Berlin would be arranged around a small inner ring and a larger outer ring of green space comprising parks, gardens, forests and meadows, which would then be connected via green-corridors radiating outward from the compact inner-city. The central focus of green space in Jansen's design was well received and laid the foundation for the creation and safeguarding of open spaces across Berlin. In addition to his focus on public space, Jansen's plan received accolades for the attention drawn to overcrowding in central Berlin, with a proposed fast transport system aimed at integrating the center of the city with peripheral areas. What made this aspect of Jansen's plan for Berlin so popular was the creation of socially positive dwellings in areas of urban expansion. These dwellings came in the form of single houses within small settlements with the intention of creating new opportunities for Berlin's less-privileged social classes to live outside the city center. Unfortunately due to the onset of World War I, Jansens's plan was only partially implemented, however evidence of his work can still be found to some extent in the cityscape. Jansen's competition winning work was showcased at the General Town Planning Exhibition (Allgemeine Stadtebay- Ausstellung) held on 1 May 1910 at the Royal Arts Academy, known today as Berlin University of the Arts. The exhibition was among the first to ever give comprehensive account of planning and the built environment. Following its unexpectedly popular reception in Berlin many sections, including Jansen's plan, were featured at the Town Planning Conference in London later that year. Academic life and later work In 1918, Jansen was in the Royal Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin and recorded in their Senate and received the title of professor. On the occasion of his 50th Birthday, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Technical University in Stuttgart as the founder and leader of the modern urban art. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the Prussian cities Ministry of Public Works. He was a member of Architects of Berlin and the Association of German Architects (BDA). In 1920, Hermann Jansen was appointed as associate professor of urban art at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg, later resigning in 1923. Jansen in 1930 became professor of urban planning at the University of Arts Berlin. He worked on and contributed to plans across Germany including; Emden, Minden, Goslar, Hameln, Osnabrück, Brandenburg, Bissingheim, Prenzlau, Neisse, Schwerin, Wałbrzych, Schweidnitz and many other small towns. Jansen also planned for foreign cities such as Riga, Łódź, Bratislava and Madrid. In the 1930s he prepared a city plan for Mersin, Turkey, and in 1938 the Mersin Interfaith Cemetery was established in one of the locations that he proposed. Ankara Following the failure of existing urban planning measures to address the uncontrolled growth experienced in Turkey's newly established capital Ankara, 1927 saw the Turkish Government put forth an international competition to create a comprehensive development plan for the new city. The government invited three prominent European planners to the competition, Frenchman Léon Jaussely and Germans Joseph Brix and Hermann Jansen. In 1929 the competition concluded with the jury declaring Jansen's proposal to be the winner, following which he was commissioned with preparing detailed development plans for the capital city. Jansen's master plan for Ankara placed particular emphasis on the historical context of the region, stressing the importance of the new settlement sitting adjacent to the existing old city rather than enveloping it within the new design. Jansen also called for the compulsory integration of green belts and areas within the city to promote a healthy urban environment, even extending this vision to the housing stock, which were designed to incorporate both front and rear gardens. A defining feature of Jansen's master plan for Ankara was his division of the city into functionally specialized zones, which was an unfamiliar concept when compared to traditional Turkish urban form. This included 18 residential sections, each developed under different patterns; and industrial zones, of which the location was determined according to the provision of transport in the area. Jansen's master plan did not include a new commercial area; rather he acknowledged the significance of the old city center as a traditional place for commercial activity, choosing to reinforce its place as the center of life in Ankara. Unfortunately due to criticism and political intervention, the master plan of Ankara was never fully completed and Jansen requested that his signature be removed from the plan in 1938.

The vehicle was developed after Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono made a visit to Pindad's main office and asked them to create an indigenous tactical vehicle in order to serve the needs of the Indonesian police and military as an alternative to other 4x4 tactical vehicles such as the Humvee as a personal challenge to the company. The vehicle was given its present name by President Yudhoyono after it was unveiled to the public at the 2012 Indo Defence Expo and Forum in Jakarta, Indonesia so that the Komodo can have a strong impression \\"at any combat field and could bring the glory for Indonesia.\\", especially since the Komodo dragon is an endemic animal native to Indonesia. Its design features are made similar to the Renault Sherpa Light Scout family, which is also used by Indonesia. The Komodo's external designs also resembles the Humvee. The Komodo tactical vehicles are slowly being adopted into Indonesian police and military service, which started after the vehicles made its public debut at Indodefence 2012. Production of these vehicles are seen to be a major shift by Pindad to move into the protected mobility domain in a cost-effective manner by the government by producing the Komodo on Indonesian soil. History The creation of the Komodo first started on October 26, 2011 when President Yudhoyono personally visited a PT Indonesian Aerospace weapon system exhibition. During his visit, he gave a challenge to Pindad's Product Development Team to make an indigenous 4×4 tactical vehicle. Pindad's Special Vehicle Division technicians bore the responsibility to make the said vehicle. In the course of developing the vehicle, Pindad looked at other armored tactical vehicles that were being produced and sold such as the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, the Nexter Aravis and the Sherpa Light family. During the visit, PT Pindad president Adik Aviantono Sudarsono was told to prepare on the production process of the vehicle when President Yudhoyono requested Pindad to have a working prototype ready in two months after his visit. Production of the Komodo was based at Pindad's factory in Bandung, West Java. The creation of a working Komodo prototype was completed in March 2012. The Komodo made its first appearance when Pindad demonstrated the tactical vehicle to several visitors at the RITech Expo in September 2012, showing the Komodo alongside the Anoa and other Pindad-made small arms to the public. Production on a working Komodo by Pindad started on October 5, 2012. On November 10, 2012, President Yudhoyono gave the name Komodo to Pindad's new tactical vehicle at the Indo Defence 2012 Expo & Forum, Jakarta International Expo, Kemayoran, Jakarta. He was asked to give the tactical vehicle a name as a formality when he was a guest in Indodefence 2012. The naming of the vehicle was because the Komodo dragon symbolizes Indonesia as a whole. President Yudhoyono was accompanied during the naming ceremony by various officials including Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro, Deputy Defense Minister Sjafrie, Police Chief General Timur Pradopo, Armed Forces Commander Admiral Agus Suhartono, Vice Governor of Jakarta Tjahaja Basuki Purnama and other high-ranking officials. A production plan of at least 240 Komodo tactical vehicles was planned after it was unveiled in Indodefence 2012. The Komodo was also unveiled to visitors who were from the Royal College of Defence Studies when they visited Pindad manufacturing facilities during official visits. The vehicle was presented to Indonesian and Singaporean military personnel at the Weaponry System Display and Practice Assistance Latma Safkar Indopura 24/2012 from November 21 to 28, 2012. The Komodo was shown to the public at the 2013 Indonesian National Armed Force Leadership Meeting exhibition at Cilangkap. Pindad has been awarded at the BUMN Award 2013 by the Indonesian government for their contribution in making the Komodo, since 80% of its components are being made locally. Pindad has reported confirmation that there are unnamed countries that are very interested to purchase Komodo tactical vehicles. Pindad has said that possible exports can be done for ASEAN member nations who wish to buy the Komodos. Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro, from Merdeka Palace, said that the production of the Komodo is a stepping stone that would eventually lead to the development of a tactical vehicle industry in Indonesia. Pindad obtained a loan of Rupiah 300-700 million from the State Capital Participation or Penyertaan Modal Negara to assist in covering the costs of producing the Komodos. The company has been given a deadline of 10 years by the government to repay the loan made from PMN funds. Pindad said that they would be able to repay the loan as soon as possible. On February 29, 2020, it was announced that the Philippines in interested in potentially purchasing Komodos.https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/29/philippines-eyes- indonesia-made-combat- vehicles.html?fbclid=IwAR31qcmIuL0yXXcAARH_7tl33sR4V5xSpuhbCu9HlF2O_6lZ1eLMDRzd5uA/ Design The establishment of Law Number 16/2012 allowed Pindad to create the Komodo to their advantage, in which the law stipulates Indonesia to have local content used in the manufacturing of its defense products with international cooperation. The Komodo was designed in Pindad's Bandung, West Java manufacturing facility with a price tag of about USD$300,000. According to Pindad, the Komodo's monocoque armored body is bulletproof and it can withstand 7.62 mm or lower caliber rifle and handgun bullets. The Komodo's glass is also made bulletproof. The Komodo's turbo intercooler diesel engine has a total horsepower of 215 PS at 2500 rpm, allowing the vehicle to achieve the weight ratio of around 30 hp/ton. The Komodo can carry up to 200 liters of diesel fuel. The vehicle only has a manual transmission system, which consists of 6 forward and 1 reverse gear, allowing the Komodo to have off-road capabilities. President Avianto said that the normal cruising range of the Komodo is at 450 kilometers, with an average speed of 70 km/h. The Komodo's off-road capabilities have been tested in various conditions ranging from mountainous terrain to mud and sand. While most parts of the Komodo are made locally in Indonesia such as the frame, body and design, Pindad has publicly stated that they used imported components such as Hino for machinery parts and Michelin for the tires. Its diesel engines were imported directly from Renault. The Komodo's monocoque steel body was made locally by Krakatau Steel. The Indonesian Army's Research and Development Department or Dislitbang TNI AD has officially certified the Komodo as a road worthy vehicle after Pindad conducted static and dynamic tests. Pindad collaborated with MBDA to create the mobile anti-aircraft SAM variant, which are armed with Mistral SAM missiles. According to the Indonesian military, a total of 56 mobile SAM units are to be made and purchased. Pindad also collaborated with Nexter to create Komodos that would serves as mobile command and communications vehicles with a total of 8 units being ordered.

Exceptions may occur if the Jordanian Sovereign wants to honour more one prince or princess, or due to some reciprocity to the partner state's honorific system.

The series is broadcast on the internet and premiered on Blip on March 28, 2012. So far, one season has been created, with season two in production. Up the creek is a comedy web series created by Joe Taylor who in real life owns the Sleepy Creek Vineyards, which is a small winery and vineyard located in Fairmount, Illinois, the Midwest region of the US. Up The Creek is about a small, financially struggling winery that has a dysfunctional staff. It reflects on the idea that with wine businesses, perceptions are usually very different from reality.  History  Up the Creek was written by Joe Taylor, and the idea emerged when Joe Taylor and Bill Kephart (Rusty) were in the vineyard crushing and pressing grapes. Joe and Bill picked the winery setting because it served as a ready made set as they had no budget. Joe, Bill and Mike Trippiedi (Major Tom) are the main writers of the show, but all of the cast contribute. Joe Taylor calls Up the Creek a \\"Sipcom”, a shorter version of a traditional sitcom that is made funnier while watched drinking a glass of wine or beer. Joe’s goal was to create a show that had a feel of classic sitcoms from the 1970s and 1980s.  Season 1  Episode 1: Wiener Fire - Grant is given control of the winery. He soon learns that the winery is in serious financial trouble. Episode 2: What Goes Up -Wine critic Park Roberts is coming to visit the winery. Episode 3: Operation Sanitation - Antonio gets an unwanted visit from a winery consultant that sticks his nose where it doesn't belong. Episode 4: Corked - Branson has to deal with a \\"challenging\\" customer. Episode 5: Jingle, Jangle, Jingles - Famous Canadian Country Western singer, Peeve Stoltz, is going to put on a concert at Sleepy Creek Episode 6: Shotgun Wedding - An episode about love, tolerance, acceptance and beer. Episode 7: The Drinking Dead - Major Tom and Rusty are seeing signs that the end is near.

It comprises material drawn from improvisations by Frith and Glennie recorded during the making of the 2004 documentary film Touch the Sound about Glennie, who is profoundly deaf. The album was released in 2007 in the United States by Tzadik Records as part of their \\"Key Series\\". A soundtrack of the film was released in 2004, which contains some of Frith and Glennie's improvisations, plus additional music and sounds from the film. Background Touch the Sound is a documentary film by German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer about profoundly deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie and how she hears with her body. In 2003 Riedelsheimer asked English experimental musician Fred Frith to perform with Glennie in the film; Frith had previously worked with Riedelsheimer on the soundtrack for his 2001 documentary, Rivers and Tides. Frith and Glennie performed in an abandoned sugar factory in Dormagen, Germany in July 2003, and were filmed under the pretext of \\"making a record\\". This was the first time that Frith and Glennie had worked together, and their entire performance was improvised. For the purpose of the documentary the musicians performed apart in the huge empty factory, which Frith said \\"was great visually, but limited in other ways\\". In addition to being filmed, their performance was also recorded on a 48-track digital recorder. Frith later worked on the recordings over the next few years in Oakland, California, extracting and reorganising the material and sending the results to Glennie for approval. Frith and Glennie also each made additional recordings which were added to the mix. Of the album, Frith said, \\"Part of the challenge lay in the fact that since we had performed in a vast empty building there was a cathedral of reverb on everything we did, reverb that could not be removed. [...] So the Sugar Factory imposed its will on us, and we learned to accept and enjoy the music for what it was.\\" Since The Sugar Factory sessions, Frith and Glennie have performed live together on several occasions. Frith said that \\"A language is developing between us, and every concert brings new discoveries.\\" Reception Martin Longley writing at All About Jazz called the album \\"a sonic pleasure\\" and said that Frith and Glennie are \\"beautifully recorded in the cathedral space of [the] disused sugar factory\\". In a review in The Squid's Ear, Kurt Gottschalk called the album \\"a beautiful session, full of the sense of the room they recorded it in, abstract and lush\\". He said that Frith's \\"tasteful looping, [...] building of soundscapes and his searing solos sound great in the big space\\", and that Glennie \\"walks a fine balance between challenge and response\\". Gottschalk said that \\"the mix is totally satisfying\\". Thom Jurek at AllMusic described the album as \\"a listening experience unlike anything else\\". He said that listeners familiar with Frith's improvising will find it fascinating, but Glennie fans may be in for a surprise. She is \\"noisier\\" here than usual, but Jurek added that the \\"cacophony\\" the pair create is \\"compelling\\", at times \\"blisslike\\", and that \\"every sound that emerges becomes a part of the bigger body of the work\\".

Bjelice are marked with number 4. Bjelice () is a historical region and tribe of the Katunska nahija region of Old Montenegro. The tribe was one of the largest traditional tribes of Old Montenegro and one of nine tribes of the Katunska nahija, along with Cetinje, Njeguši, Ćeklići, Cuce, Ozrinići (Čevo), Pješivci, Zagarač and Komani. Geography The Bjelice region is located 20–50 km northwest of Cetinje. It is of a relatively high altitude (800–900 meters above sea level) and is surrounded by high mountains – Čelinac, Štavor and Čevski lisac. Today, Bjelice is considered a geographic region corresponding to the territory of the traditional tribe. History Czech historian Konstantin Jireček noted that Bjelice was first mentioned as a territory around 1430 (\\"de zente Bielice\\"). They are also mentioned in a 1431 document found in the Kotor Archives, and in the Ottoman defter (tax registry) from 1521. Bjelice are described as a village comprising 80 houses and four hamlets: Lješev Stup (Lješev Stub), Prediš, Rešna (Resna) and Staković. It is believed that Bjelice, along with the clans (brotherhoods) of Cuce and Bajice, are the descendants of the Orlović clan. Pavle Orlović is a Serb legendary hero who fell at the Battle of Kosovo (1389), which legend holds that these clans are his descendants, it is likely it was from his brothers (as there are no written records of him having any descendants). The Orlović flight from Kosovo before the advancing Ottomans had them settle in around Gacko and neighboring villages (Čarađe, Bjeletaci). They later moved to Banjani and finally to the territory of Old Montenegro. In 17th century Ceklin tribe expelled Bjelice from the territory they inhabit today (around Skadar Lake and Rijeka Crnojevića). In 1829 Bjelice struggled against Ozrinići and Cuce, two neighboring tribes, and Petar I Petrović-Njegoš sent Sima Milutinović Sarajlija and Mojsije to negotiate peace among them. Anthropology Brotherhoods The Bjelice tribe was divided into Upper (Gornje) Bjelice and Lower (Donje) Bjelice. Like most tribes, it also consisted of numerous brotherhoods and families. The largest brotherhood was Milići whose branch are Lončarevići. Older brotherhoods are also Abramović, Andrić, Pejović, Kuzman, Popivoda, Tomić and Mikulić while there is also a number of younger brotherhoods. Many emigrants from the tribe took Bjelica for their surname.

It is a portfolio company of Pamoja Capital Group, a private investment firm. History eTeacher Group was co-founded in the year 2000 by brothers, Boaz and Yariv Binnun. In 2002, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs granted the company the challenge of founding the world's first online Hebrew school. Children of employees in the Israeli diplomatic service could use such a service to learn to read, write and speak Hebrew correctly, despite growing up abroad and moving from country to country. A few months later the online platform created by the company started serving Israeli children and families abroad, and then in 2005, an online Hebrew School for the Jewish communities round the world was launched. In 2008 eTeacher launched Highway to English, an online ESL school, which connects teachers and education professionals from the USA with students from all over the world. The English language program includes 5 different levels, each with its own curriculum and set of courses. In 2008 eTeacher launched the Israel Institute of Biblical Studies , providing online courses for Biblical languages and Bible study Since January 2010, the company has been collaborating with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in providing courses related to Biblical Studies. These courses are accredited for students of the university, as well as providing language students with academic based courses, supervised by university staff members. In 2017 the company launched Tekkie Uni, an online school where children learn to program and build games, apps and more. Tekkie Uni offers both synchronous online courses for children to learn coding from home, and a programming curriculum for schools. The company has since utilized a wide variety of online technology to build and manage large-scale online virtual schools. Teaching methods The company provides an online platform for teaching synchronous, live, teacher-led classes, while utilizing a range of tools alongside a team of teachers and scholars. The teaching process is based on a system which incorporates different teaching tools, the backbone of which is a weekly live lesson with a language teacher (usually native to the language he or she teaches in). The company employs some 300 teachers from around the world. Alongside the weekly \\"real-time\\" lessons the courses include a weekly practice lesson. In order to supplement these online weekly meetings, the courses also provide recorded dialogues and recorded lessons. Also, supplementing the electronic and online aspects of the programs, the student my also make use of provided teaching textbooks and workbooks in the language and level the course is focused on. Between lessons the student is expected to complete assignments and homework, which are in turn graded by the staff. Virtual schools The different courses are divided into five schools, each with a staff of teachers, learning platforms and a website. Each of these schools offers courses at different levels and localization. TekkieUni - Coding for Kids  The program is designed for children in elementary school, junior high, and high school who want to learn how to create and develop software and games for iOS, Android, and computers.  Highway To English  Live online English courses and tutoring with teachers from the USA The Israel Institute of Biblical Studies Launched in 2007, the Biblical languages school teaches courses in Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic and Biblical Greek. Since 2010, the Biblical school also offers academically credited courses for Hebrew University of Jerusalem students. The courses in this school are supervised by academic staff from the university. Chinese Voice The Chinese School offers courses in Chinese, in up to five levels of difficulty. The Rosen School of Hebrew The Hebrew school was the first to be launched, and is probably the most wide spread. It offers courses in Hebrew for adults and for children, alongside seminars for Hebrew language students.

She wrote short stories and other works and served on the editing staff for a variety of college publications such as the Monthly Board, the Weekly Board, and the Class Book Board. During her junior year Brush was the class historian. She wrote the \\"History of Junior Year\\" for her class in the 1917 yearbook, as well as the words for the Ivy Song and for \\"Alma Mater.\\" She graduated from Smith College in 1917.  Career  While Brush's first husband, Charles, was serving in the Ordinance Officers' Reserve Corp of the Army as a first lieutenant from 1917 to 1919, Dorothy worked for various charities in Washington, D.C., and then in Sheffield, Alabama. In 1919 Charles and Dorothy embarked on a round-the-world trip that included a stop in Honolulu, Hawaii, and then returned to the United States to settle in the Cleveland, Ohio area where Charles established the Brush Research Laboratory. Beginning in 1922 Brush volunteered for the Junior League in the Cleveland area. Her work in a prenatal clinic led to her increased awareness, and advocacy, of women's health issues and birth control. Along with several friends and supporters, Brush played a large part in the establishment of the Maternal Health Association in 1928, the precursor to Planned Parenthood of Cleveland, established in 1966. After the death of her first husband, Dorothy donated funds and opened the Maternal Health Association (MHA) in 1928, a project which she and others had been planning since 1921. MHA later became the Planned Parenthood of Greater Cleveland. In 1929 her father-in-law, inventor Charles F. Brush, Sr., appointed Dorothy to the Board of Managers of his newly created Brush Foundation. Dorothy Brush continued her work with the Maternal Health Association but also became increasingly involved with the Foundation, serving as an administrator and later as Chairman from 1957 to 1963. The Brush Foundation still exists and has broadened its mission to include research and education on a wide variety of birth control issues.  Work with Margaret Sanger  Brush volunteered in Sanger's clinic and later in the 1930s traveled with her throughout Asia and Europe as a missionary for birth control and family planning. Brush placed great value on Sanger's work and, as a Smith College alumna, knew about the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC) and its collecting efforts in women's history. She wrote to Margaret Storrs Grierson, director of the SSC, in 1946 and together they convinced Sanger to donate her papers to Smith (portions of her professional papers were already given to the Library of Congress). Brush was also instrumental in Sanger's receiving an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Smith College in 1949 and led the effort to nominate her for a Nobel Prize. Even as her work with Margaret Sanger and the birth control movement became a central focus, Brush continued her writing. She co-wrote (using her maiden name Dorothy Adams Hamilton) with Walter S. Hayward the books, The American People: A Popular History of the United States, 1865-1941 (1943) and Your Land and My Land: The American People from Lincoln to Roosevelt (1943). Brush also wrote travel articles for the magazine World Traveller and a few children's plays for the Samuel French Company that were published in the late 1920s. In addition to these published materials, Brush also authored a number of manuscripts on women in Japan, Margaret Sanger, birth control, and on menopause that were never published. In 1952 Sanger and Brush saw the fruit of their work in the international birth control movement with the establishment of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Also in 1952 Brush started the IPPF newsletter, Around the World News of Population and Birth Control, which received funding from the Brush Foundation, and she served as its editor until 1956. Although she had intended to retire at this point in part due to health problems, in 1957 Brush agreed to serve as Honorary Advisor for Field Work Services. Many field offices faced political and legal obstacles in continuing their work with family planning and birth control, and Brush and the rest of the field officers helped to support their efforts by locating funding, recruiting volunteers, and generally providing solid, reliable information. Brush continued this work for 4 years, finally retiring in 1961. In the early 1960s Brush spent an increasing amount of time at Sanger's home in Arizona due to Sanger's failing health, assisting her until Sanger died in 1966. Brush suffered herself during these years and many years before from emphysema and other maladies, and her travel and activities were often restricted.  Personal life  In 1917 Brush married her first husband, Charles Francis Brush, Jr., son of Charles Brush, the creator of a new arc lamp and lighting system and founder of Brush Electric, which later merged with two other companies to become General Electric. Their first child, Jane, was born in 1920 and their second child, Charles III, was born in 1923. In May 1927 Brush's six-year-old daughter Jane became ill with pneumonia and needed a blood transfusion, for which her father Charles had volunteered to donate his blood. Jane did not recover and died, and Charles suffered complications from the transfusion, dying a week later. In 1929, Brush married Alexander Colclough Dick and they moved to New York City. In 1930 their daughter Sylvia was born. In 1947, the pair divorced. In 1962, Brush married Dr. Lewis C. Walmsley, an educational missionary and Professor at the University of Toronto whom she had first met in 1937 through Margaret Sanger.  Death  Dorothy Brush died on June 4, 1968.  Honors  Because of her continued work with and dedication to Smith College, Brush was awarded a Smith College Medal in October 1967. The medal noted her tireless work with family planning and women's health, her unfailing support of Margaret Sanger, and her numerous contributions to the Sophia Smith Collection and Smith College.

Topology and rainfall The land in the south and west of South Sudan slopes down to the northeast from the Nile-Congo Divide towards the Bahr el Ghazal swamps. The divide is formed by a plateau rising above sea level, with some peaks that rise to . Rainfall is higher on the plateau than in the lower clay floodplains. The rainy season lasts from May until November. Annual rainfall is . The plateau drains into the floodplain through rivers that cross an ironstone peneplain and then spread out into deltas and swamps. The soils of the plateau have little capacity to hold water, so most of the run-off drains into the floodlands. The many streams draining the plateau have formed steep and narrow valleys. Soil and vegetation The Ironstone Plateau takes its name from the hard red lateritic soil called ironstone that covers almost the entire area. These soils are often thin and may be unsuitable for agriculture, except in the Green Belt in the extreme southwest of Western Equatoria and in a region around the Acholi Mountains in the Torit County of Eastern Equatoria. The country north and east of the ironstone plateau is covered in clayish black cotton soil, mostly grasslands that are prone to flooding. The black cotton soil cracks when it is dry, but expands and becomes sticky in the rain, making travel difficult. The ironstone plateau has more trees and travel is easier. The plateau and peneplain are mostly wooded. People and economy The people of the plateau generally speak Bantu languages while the people of the floodplains are Nilotic. The plateau population includes Zande in Western Equatoria and Bari speakers in Central Equatoria on either side of the Nile. They raise some livestock and engage in rain-fed agriculture, growing cereals such as Sorghum and pearl millet, vegetables and cassava in mixed croppings. Other crops are oil seeds, groundnuts, sesame, cowpeas and okra, and mangoes, citrus and melons. The best soil for agriculture is beside the streams that drain the plateau. The forests yield mahogany from the Raga region and plantation teak.

Services on the line are operated as timetable line 662. Between Worms and Gensingen-Horrweiler it has the line number of 3560, between Gensingen-Horrweiler and Büdesheim-Dromersheim junction it has the line number of 3512 (used for the Gau Algesheim–Bad Kreuznach railway), and between Büdesheim-Dromersheim and Bingen it has the line number of 3569. The line has both single and double-track sections. History The line was opened in three different sections successively between 1864 and 1871 by the private Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn, HLB). Along with the HLB, the line was nationalised on 1 April 1897 and became part of the Prussian-Hessian Railway Operation and Financial Association (). This organisation later shared the fate of the Prussian state railways and was absorbed into the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Operation The line is operated by Deutsche Bahn. It is served by class 628/629 diesel multiple units, and occasionally by trains hauled by class 218 locomotives. Between Monsheim and Worms there is a service about every half-hour. Hourly services run from Bingen Stadt to Worms. The additional trains to Monsheim are hauled by class 218 locomotives and continue from Alzey to Mainz. On Saturdays and Sundays the trains of Worms continue to Mannheim to combine with the RB44 between Worms and Mannheim to produce a 30-minute interval service.

He arrived in Sebastian, Florida in 1881 and homesteaded with his father on a shell midden on the west bank of the Indian River Lagoon overlooking Pelican Island. The island consisted of a five-acres of mangrove where thousands of brown pelicans and other water birds would roost and nest. Kroegel protected the island's avian inhabitants with his shotgun and would stand guard at a time when neither state nor federal laws protected the animals. Influential naturalists visited and stayed at the nearby Oak Lodge from the 1880s to the early 1900s, including ornithologist Frank Chapman (ornithologist) (curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1901, the American Ornithologists' Union and the Florida Audubon Society led efforts to pass legislation in Florida calling for the protection of non-game birds. Kroegel was one of four wardens hired by the Florida Audubon Society to protect water birds from market hunters. Two of the wardens were murdered doing this work. Additional protections were granted by president Theodore Roosevelt who signed an executive order establishing Pelican Island as the first federal bird reservation, part of a network of 55 bird reservation and national game preserved for wildlife that were forerunners to the national wildlife refuge system.

Three unsuccessful wells preceded the strike, which initially produced 400 barrels of high-grade oil a day from a depth of between and . Because no mechanism existed to control the flow, the oil was diverted into pits for collection and storage. The source of the oil was a sand zone in the Drumright Dome, a syncline. Slick attempted to keep the strike secret, hiring armed guards, but eventually revealed the well's success in April 1912. A dugout built for the guards remains on the site, together with a commemorative plaque. In time, the well's pressure subsided, requiring that the oil be pumped out of the well. The first pump was a two-cylinder gasoline-powered pump, later replaced by an electric drive. With the reduction in pressure the well was modified for secondary recovery, using an early form of hydraulic fracturing called \\"sand fracturing.\\" As of 1980 it produced about a barrel a day, pumping four hours a day. Oil came from three layers: the Layton layer at , the Wheeler layer at , and the Bartlesville layer at .

It was created for Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet in 1624. The Crooke family came originally from Cransley in Northamptonshire; Thomas Crooke, the father of the first baronet, was a well-known preacher of strongly Calvinist views. Sir Thomas Crooke was granted substantial lands in County Cork in 1607. He founded the town of Baltimore, which was largely destroyed in the Sack of Baltimore in 1631, and he also gave his name to the village of Crookhaven. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Baltimore in the Irish Parliament of 1613-15. Although he claimed to have been moved principally by religious fervour in founding Baltimore, he was often accused of having founded the town to profit by piracy. Baltimore was described as a nest of pirates, which drew most of its wealth from the pirate trade. A Privy Council investigation in 1608 cleared him of any wrongdoing, but his innocence or guilt is still a matter of debate. The title became dormant in 1666, when the son of the 2nd Baronet, Thomas, obtained a patent 12 July 1666 for certain lands, and on marrying the sister of the forfeiting proprietor of these lands (Ellen MacDermot MacCarthy, the daughter of Tiege MacDermot MacCarthy), he dropped the title.

Second World War Heglund had tried to enlist with the Norwegian army flight school in the autumn of 1939 but the admission deadline had already expired. When he completed his period of national service conscription he travelled to Zurich to study engineering. He was in Switzerland when Norway was invaded by Germany in April 1940. Heglund managed to reach the United States via Bordeaux and Portsmouth. In New York he joined fellow Norwegians (Bernt Balchen, Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and some other Norwegian officers) in the Army Air Force. In July 1940 he went to Little Norway near Toronto, Canada.

The squadron's duties were to fly cover over the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow and escort convoys. In November 1941 the squadron received Spitfire Mk. IIAs, which in March 1942 was replaced with Spitfire Mk. Vb. A few weeks later the squadron moved south to an RAF North Weald in Essex. The squadron was now involved in escorting bombers to targets on the continent and defending London from air attack. After completing over 200 hours of operational flying Heglund was sent to a Spitfire Operational Training Unit in February 1943. After three months, he returned to 331 Squadron as a newly appointed captain and commander of the squadron's A-flight. Whilst with 331 Squadron Heglund shot down 12 fighters confirmed with 5 probables. In November 1943 Heglund transferred to RAF Ferry Command, transporting aircraft from manufacturer to airfields. No. 85 Squadron RAF In 1944 contacted John Cunningham, former commander of No. 85 Squadron RAF. With this squadron he trained on the Mosquito and became a night fighter. Post war In 1945 Heglund returned to Zurich to complete his studies. Back in Norway he held several positions in connection with the Air Force Material Command (LFK). In 1970 he became Chief of Air Defence of the Armed Forces High Command, and in 1974 Head of LFK (a position he held until he retired in 1982, with the rank of major general. Awards The first Norwegian decoration Heglund received was War Cross (Norway) which was awarded \\"for having rendered the Norwegian Defence major services through active participation in air operations against the enemy through a long time.\\" During the war he shot down 16 German planes; 7 Focke-Wulf Fw 190, 6 Messerschmitt Bf 109 and as a night fighter he shot down 3 Messerschmitt Bf 110.

Best known as a sculptor, he also made important reliefs and drawings as well as sculptural constructions in wood and metal. Having studied at the Liverpool College of Art and Slade School of Fine Art, Kenny taught at Goldsmiths College 1966–68 and the Slade 1981–82 and was awarded RA in 1986. Kenny completed many public commissions and exhibitions including retrospectives at Wilhelm-Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg (1984), Hansard Gallery in Southampton (1990), and Dulwich Picture Gallery (1994) following a residency there from 1992 to 1993. He died on 28 December 1999. He is buried in Highgate cemetery in London.  Early life  Born in 1941, Kenny had a Jesuit education, going on to study at the Liverpool College of Art (1959-61). He continued his studies at the Slade School of Fine Art (1961–64) under the supervision of sculptor Reginald Butler, who referred to young Kenny as \\"the Liverpool Italian\\" due to his fascination for the works of Giacometti and the vast plaster structures he was creating at the time. During the 1970s he lectured at Slade; and he headed the department of Fine Arts at Goldsmiths College from 1983 to 1988. In 1995 he took the position of Principal of the London City and Guilds Art School. He was a widely recognised British sculptors during the 1980s and 1990s, and his robust geometric stonework won special attention. He became a Royal Academy of Arts Associate in 1976 and joined the list of Royal Academicians in 1986. In 1993, Kenny became artist-in-residence at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London.  Exhibitions of his work  Kenny's first one-man show was in 1964 at Oxford's Bear Lane Gallery, and in 1978 he exhibited at Annely Juda. In 1964, he won an award Littlewoods Sculptural Design Competition and he received major awards from the Arts Council in 1975, 1977 and 1980. His work is widely. Collections are held at the British Museum, the RA, The Tate Gallery, the V&A;, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the British Council, Leeds City Art Gallery, Bath's Quest Gallery and the Walker Art Gallery Liverpool. Michael Kenny has been exhibited across Europe, US, Middle East and Asia; and his work is increasingly sought after by collectors. Indeed, his work is particularly recognised in Japan following various exhibitions and installations. He completed a collection of eight paintings inspired by the Ryōan-ji Zen Garden in Kyoto, illustrating Kenny's use of charcoal, right- leaning symmetry and a bleed of pink cherry blossom. One of his sculptures remains on public display in Yokohama, Japan.  Motifs and meaning  Throughout his life, Kenny's work addressed the isolation of the human condition, expressed often through the seated or reclining female figure, abstracted and depersonalised, touching landscape and geometry; often incorporating devices such as plumb-lines evoking a science and accuracy within the emotive shapes. Due to its location, probably Kenny's widest viewed work is his 1992 sculpture – On Strange And Distant Islands – a 25 ft high lateral relief spanning 150 ft of wall above London's busy Limehouse Link tunnel entrance, carved from 70 tons of Kilkenny limestone. His last great series of drawings – The Stations of The Cross – encapsulate the full range of his imagery and references and, according to Professor Brian Falconbridge at a major exhibition of Kenny's work at the Quest Gallery in Bath, rank as one of the finest examples of genuinely religious art within the Christian tradition made since the Reformation. Acquired by the Royal Academy in 1998, the 14 powerful mixed-media drawings represent a modern interpretation of a pilgrimage of the mind, in which the 14 moments of Christ's Passion are captured in time.

It was proclaimed a museum on 23 March 1962, and is a province-aided museum which receives support from the Government of the Western Cape. The museum includes four period houses which depict the way people lived and the difference in architectural styles over the periods illustrated (the Village Museum). It also includes a historical powder magazine and a toy museum. Schreuder House Schreuder House interior The Schreuder House is the first period house in the museum complex and is furnished according to the period c. 1709. The house was built in August 1707 by Sebastian Schreuder, who was a German messenger of the court of the Dutch East India Company. It is a pioneer cottage with a thatched roof and clay floor. Because window glass had to be imported from Holland, the windows are made of linen or gauze stretched over a frame with beeswax to seal the cloth against the elements. During a hard downpour, the housewife simply closed the outside shutters; in fine weather the catches were released, the whole frame was lifted out, and fresh air was let in. The house was declared a monument in 1974, and is currently listed as a Grade II Western Cape provincial heritage site. Bletterman House Bletterman House The Bleterman House in the museum complex depicts the period of c. 1789. The house was built by Hendrik Lodewyk Bletterman, Landdrost (Magistrate) of Stellenbosch from 1785–1795. This dwelling is a Cape Dutch H-shaped house and an examples of a gabled house from the 18th century. The site on which Bletterman House is situated was purchased by Hendrik Lodewyk Bletterman in 1787. Since the Hertzog plan of 1817 shows a building on this site, it is assumed that Bletterman built the house sometime before that date. After his death in 1824, the house was sold to the Landdrost and Heemraden, and was converted into offices and a courtroom, becoming the \\"Stellenbosch Public Offices\\". The outbuilding was renovated and equipped with 50 school benches and served as a school for slaves. The school was officially opened in September 1825,with Erasmus Smit as teacher. There is no record that the main house was ever used as a residence after Bletterman's death. The Stellenbosch Police used the buildings as their headquarters from about 1879–1969 when it was acquired by the Stellenbosch Museum.Fransen H, Stellenbosch Drie Eeue The house is listed as a provincial heritage site. Grosvenor House Grosvenor House The Grosvenor House is a mansion that depicts the period c. 1803, and is the ancestral home of the Neethling family. The site on which it stands was granted to Christiaan Ludolph Neethling in 1781, and a year later he had built a double-storey house on the property. Successive owners kept the house virtually unaltered. In 1872, Sir Christoffel J. Brand, first speaker of the Cape House of Assembly, became the new owner. After his death in 1876, William Collins of Bath, England, bought the property and it remained in the possession of his wife until 1941. The Collins family named the building Grosvenor House and converted it into a guest house. Grosvenor House was the building in which the Stellenbosch Museum was located at the time of its proclamation. The building has been restored to illustrate the period c. 1800–c. 1830 when Willem Herold and his family. The house has been declared a provincial heritage site. Individual items of furniture reflect the increasing influence of English taste on local furniture design after the second British occupation of the Cape in 1806 when Neoclassicism was in fashion. The interior doors have stinkwood frames and yellowwood panels. There are unusual shutters of the same wood and a heavy front door of solid teak. The facade of the house was designed in the classical style with fluted pilasters running up to support a wide cornice. The classicism is repeated in the treatment of the pedimented front door, which surrounds a plasterwork palm tree, the symbol on the Stellenbosch Church seal. The plants in the garden of this house are those that would have been popular during the period. O.M. Bergh House Bergh House Bergh House interior This Victorian house (now a provincial heritage site) was first owned by Christiaan Krynauw who is presumed to have erected a new T-shaped dwelling on the site. Olof Marthinus Bergh bought the property in 1836. He was born in Cape Town in 1792, and was Deputy-Sheriff of Stellenbosch. An upper storey was added to the house during the second half of the 19th century. The house is furnished to reflect the interior of a typical middle-class Stellenbosch home during the period 1840 – 1880, more-or-less the time it was occupied by Bergh and his family. Heavy mahogany furniture in the prevailing English taste was very fashionable at the time and the Victorian penchant for clutter often made it difficult to move about in the drawing room. Wallpaper and family portraits are further indications of how sombre interior decoration was at the time – particularly after the Great Exhibition in 1851. The garden is laid out in the style of the period with roses and other shrubs that were popular during the mid-19th century. V.O.C. Kruithuis (powder magazine) Powder Magazine In the turbulent last quarter of the eighteenth century, the Governor and the Political Council at Cape Town came to the conclusion that it was desirable to store ammunition at Stellenbosch. Stellenbosch was also allowed cannon and guns, and the gunpowder and ammunition necessary to ward off an enemy attack, and a suitable building for storing this material had to be constructed. The consent of the governing council of the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C.) in the Netherlands was duly applied for and received, and authority was given to build the arsenal or magazine. On 7 October 1776, the Landdrost called for tenders for erection of the building. That of Philip Hartog and Lambert Fick for 9000 guilders was accepted and on 5 May 1777, the building was completed. Stellenbosch has always been a peaceful town and not once during its 300 years of existence have guns been fired as an act of war. The V.O.C. Kruithuis therefore soon lost its strategic military value and in less than seventy years became the site of the local Friday market. After serving as a market house for almost a century, it was restored by the Stellenbosch Municipality in 1936. The building was proclaimed a National Monument (now a provincial heritage site) on 10 May 1940, and in 1943, was opened to the public as a small Africana Museum.The museum did not exist for very long, and there were many years during which the building remained locked and inaccessible to the public. In 1971, the municipality agreed to allow the Stellenbosch Museum to take over the building for display of its collection of fire-arms, cannon, military uniforms, and other objects. The V.O.C. Kruithuis is unique in South Africa as it is the only remaining powder magazine in the country dating from the days of the Dutch East India Company, and it is a symbol of the town's rich and varied architectural heritage.Stellenbosch Museum Publications The Stellenbosch Museum has published the following books:   See also  *List of heritage sites in Stellenbosch  References   Literature  * *  External links  * Stellenbosch Heritage Trust Category:History museums in South Africa Category:Museums established in 1962 Category:Stellenbosch Category:South African heritage sites Category:Museums in the Western Cape Category:Museums in South Africa Category:Local museums in South Africa ","title":"Stellenbosch Museum"},{"id":"39325580","text":"German Lottery is a novel by Miha Mazzini.

Biography Dorothy was the daughter of Ambrose Smith of Withcote, Leicestershire, and of Cheapside (silkman to Queen Elizabeth), by his wife Jane Cooe. She married Benedict Barnham at St Clement Eastcheap on 28 April 1583. They had eight children. Three girls and a boy died in infancy. The remaining four girls lived to marry. Elizabeth, the eldest married Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, Alice married Sir Francis Bacon in 1606, Dorothy married Sir John Constable of Gray's Inn and of Dromby, Yorkshire, and Bridget married Sir William Soame of Thurlow, Suffolk. When Barnham died in 1598 he left an estate of £20,000 of whom the chief beneficiaries were Dorothy and her daughters. Within two years Dorothy had remarried. Her second husband was Sir John Pakington (a favourite of Queen Elizabeth) whom she married in November 1598. They had two daughters and a son. Anne, Dorothy's elder daughter by her second husband, married at Kensington, on 9 February 1619, Sir Humphrey Ferrers, son of Sir John Ferrers of Tamworth Castle, Warwickshire; and, after his decease, Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield. Her second daughter by her second marriage, Mary, married Sir Richard Brooke of Nacton in Suffolk. The only son of the second marriage, John (1600–1624), was created a baronet in June 1620, and sat in Parliament for Aylesburyin 1623–1624. He married Frances, daughter of Sir John Ferrers of Tamworth, with whom he had two children, including his heir Sir John Pakington, 2nd Baronet (1620–1680) The union between Dorothy and Sir John was not a happy one and early in 1607 Pakington \\"and his little violent lady … parted upon foul terms\\". In 1617 she appealed to the law, and Pakington was forced to appear before the court of high commission, and was committed to gaol. It was the unpleasant duty of the Attorney General, Francis Bacon (who had married Lady Pakington's daughter, Alice Barnham), to give an opinion against his mother-in-law. In 1628 Dorothy quarrelled with her sons-in-law respecting the administration of her husband's estate, which was transferred to the sons-in-law in February 1629. cites: Lords' Journals, iii. pp. 827, 862, 872, iv. pp. 23–4. In or about 1629 Dorothy took a third husband (Robert Needham, 1st Viscount Kilmorey), who had already married three times, and who died in November 1631. Subsequently she became the third wife of Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie He died on 12 June 1639, and she probably died about the same date.

Subash Prasad Khakurel became the fourth Nepalese cricketer to score an international century, when he slammed 115 off 142 balls against USA during the 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four in September 2012. He represents the APF Club of the National League, Kantipur Gurkhas of the Nepal Premier League and Sudur Pashchimanchal Academy, which plays in the SPA Cup.  Playing career  It was the practice match before 2010 Division Five matches; Subash Khakurel hammered 53 runs off just 34 balls against USA. Then USA coach Clayton Lambert was surprised to know he was not included in the Nepal squad. He later said \\"it won't take too long for him to earn National cap.\\" Indeed, it did not take too long for him. He is naturally attacking; right-hand opening batsman loves to create room and hit boundaries in offside. His quick learning capability helped him to cement his place in the team. Early from his career he was a batsman who looked relatively comfortable in facing sharp Pakistani & Sri Lankan bowling attacks in his debut series. He was selected in the squad to play 2011 ICC Under-19 World Cup Qualifier, where he scored well complied half-century in his first match against Afghanistan. With the entry of coach Pubudu Dassanayake, he brought few changes in selection policies which surprised many people. Coach’s policy to include new faces in the team added wings to Subash’s dream. Yes, the dream of wearing national jersey. His score of 115 runs against USA in the crucial match of 2012 Division Four, not out 40 runs against USA in the final of the same tournament, half-century against UAE in the final of 2012 ACC Trophy Elite, 78 against Pakistan U-23 in 2013 ACC Emerging Teams Cup and half century against Kenya in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, 71 against UAE in the 2014 ACC Premier League proved that he is a big match player and he can win the match on himself for Nepal. His half century against England in 2012 ICC Under-19 World Cup was well appreciated by like of legends like Wasim Akram. His absence was a huge loss for Nepal in 2014 World Cup Qualifier where did not play any match due to fever so Nepal had to change the opening pair time and again changing the course of the game. It was one of the major reasons behind failure of Nepalese team in the tournament. He was the highest scorer from Nepal during the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier with 234 runs with his best score being a significant 54 that helped Nepal chase a mammoth 183 runs against Kenya. He scored a half century against Afghanistan in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, the first Twenty20 International half century by a Nepalese batsman. Due to the innings like this, he is known for his ability to perform at the big stage. He also scored 39 runs in three innings he batted during the 2014 Asian Games at an average of 39. He scored 112 runs in the 2014 ICC World Cricket League Division Three held in Malaysia including man of the match performance of an unbeaten 49 against United States. In July 2018, he was named in Nepal's squad for their One Day International (ODI) series against the Netherlands.

The term is generally used in reference to missile guidance systems, and specifically to missiles that use more than one guidance system through the missile's flight. Common examples include long-range air- to-air missiles that use semi-active radar homing (SARH) during most of the missile's flight, and then use an infrared seeker or active radar homing once they approach their target. Similar examples include surface-to-air missiles, anti-ballistic missiles, and some anti-tank missiles. Concept Radar beams are cone-shaped, spreading out from the diameter of the antenna at a characteristic angle that is a function of the size of the antenna and its wavelength. This means that as one moves away from the radar, its accuracy continues to degrade while the signal grows weaker. This makes it difficult to use the radar signal itself as the guidance signal, a system known as beam riding, except for very short-range engagements. However, the signal being reflected off the target also forms a cone shape centred on the target, but with a much greater spread angle. This leads to one of the most common types of radar-based missile guidance, semi-active radar homing, or SARH. This places a small receiver in the nose of the missile that listens for the signals reflected off the target, and therefore grows more accurate and powerful as the missile approaches the target. However, after launch the target return is at a minimum. While the launch platform may have no trouble picking up the signal from a distant target, the much smaller antenna in the missile may not be receiving enough of a signal to properly track. In these cases, some other form of guidance is used to get the missile into the range where the signal is stronger. Examples would be radio control (command guidance) or inertial guidance systems, which fly the missile closer to the target. In this role, these are known as \\"midcourse guidance\\" systems. In practice, terminal guidance systems are often optical or active radar systems, in an effort to greatly increase accuracy. These systems often have many times the accuracy of solutions like SARH, but operate only at short ranges, on the order of a few kilometers. Missiles that are designed to operate entirely within the range of these sorts of systems, like heat seeking missiles, do not use the term \\"terminal guidance\\" because they use the same guidance system throughout their flight.

Connective tissue, muscular components, and peritoneal components originate in the mesoderm. Different regions of the gut tube such as the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, etc. are specified by a retinoic acid gradient that causes transcription factors unique to each region to be expressed. Differentiation of the gut and its derivatives depends upon reciprocal interactions between the gut endoderm and its surrounding mesoderm. Hox genes in the mesoderm are induced by a Hedgehog signaling pathway secreted by gut endoderm and regulate the craniocaudal organization of the gut and its derivatives. The gut system extends from the oropharyngeal membrane to the cloacal membrane and is divided into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Body cavities At the end of the third week, the neural tube, which is a fold of one of the layers of the trilaminar germ disc, called the ectoderm, appears. This layer elevates and closes dorsally, while the gut tube rolls up and closes ventrally to create a “tube on top of a tube.” The mesoderm, which is another layer of the trilaminar germ disc, holds the tubes together and the lateral plate mesoderm, the middle layer of the germ disc, splits to form a visceral layer associated with the gut and a parietal layer, which along with the overlying ectoderm, forms the lateral body wall. The space between the visceral and parietal layers of lateral plate mesoderm is the primitive body cavity. When the lateral body wall folds, it moves ventrally and fuses at the midline. The body cavity closes, except in the region of the connecting stalk. Here, the gut tube maintains an attachment to the yolk sac. The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to the embryo, which provides nutrients and functions as the circulatory system of the very early embryo. The lateral body wall folds, pulling the amnion in with it so that the amnion surrounds the embryo and extends over the connecting stalk, which becomes the umbilical cord, which connects the fetus with the placenta. If the ventral body wall fails to close, ventral body wall defects can result, such as ectopia cordis, a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located outside the thorax. Another defect is gastroschisis, a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude. Another possibility is bladder exstrophy, in which part of the urinary bladder is present outside the body. In normal circumstances, the parietal mesoderm will form the parietal layer of serous membranes lining the outside (walls) of the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The visceral layer will form the visceral layer of the serous membranes covering the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs. These layers are continuous at the root of each organ as the organs lie in their respective cavities. The peritoneum, a serum membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity, forms in the gut layers and in places mesenteries extend from the gut as double layers of peritoneum. Mesenteries provide a pathway for vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to the organs. Initially, the gut tube from the caudal end of the foregut to the end of the hindgut is suspended from the dorsal body wall by dorsal mesentery. Ventral mesentery, derived from the septum transversum, exists only in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper portion of the duodenum. Diaphragm and thoracic cavity The diaphragm divides the body cavity into the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity. It develops from four components: the septum transversum (central tendon), the pleuroperitoneal membranes, the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus, and muscular components from somites at cervical levels three to five (C3–5) of the body wall. Since the septum transversum is located initially opposite cervical segments of three to five, and since muscle cells for the diaphragm originate from somites at these segments, the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, also arises from these segments of the spinal cord (C3, 4, and 5). The thoracic cavity is divided into the pericardial cavity and two pleural cavities for the lungs by the pleuropericardial membranes. Divisions of the gut tube Diagram showing the process by which the intestine rotates and herniates during normal development. From panel A to B (left-sided views), the midgut loop rotates 90° in a counterclockwise direction, so that its position changes from midsagittal (A) to transverse (B1). The small intestine forms loops (B2) and slides back into the abdomen (B3) during resolution of the hernia. Meanwhile, the cecum moves from the left to the right side, which represents the additional 180° counterclockwise rotation of the intestine (C, central view). As a result of the cephalocaudal and lateral folding of the embryo, a portion of the endoderm-lined yolk sac cavity is incorporated into the embryo to form the primitive gut. In the cephalic and caudal parts of the embryo, the primitive gut forms a tube, the foregut and hindgut, respectively. The middle part, the midgut, remains temporally connected to the yolk sac by means of the vitelline duct. Foregut The foregut gives rise to the esophagus, the trachea, lung buds, the stomach, and the duodenum proximal to the entrance of the bile duct. In addition, the liver, pancreas, and biliary apparatus develop as outgrowths of the endodermal epithelium of the upper part of the duodenum. Since the upper part of the foregut is divided by the tracheoesophageal septum into the esophagus posteriorly and the trachea and lung buds anteriorly, deviation of the septum may result in abnormal openings between the trachea and esophagus. The epithelial liver cords and biliary system growing out into the septum transversum differentiate into parenchyma. Hematopoietic cells (present in the liver in greater numbers before birth than afterward), Kupffer cells, and connective tissue cells originate in the mesoderm. The pancreas develops from a ventral bud and a dorsal bud that later fuse to form the definitive pancreas. Sometimes, the two parts surround the duodenum (annular pancreas), causing constriction of the gut. Midgut The midgut forms the primary intestinal loop, from which originates the distal duodenum to the entrance of the bile duct. The loop continues to the junction of the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon with the distal third. At its apex, the primary loop remains temporarily in open connection with the yolk sac through the vitelline duct. During the sixth week, the loop grows so rapidly that it protrudes into the umbilical cord (physiological herniation). In the 10th week, it returns into the abdominal cavity. While these processes are occurring, the midgut loop rotates 270° counterclockwise. Common abnormalities at this stage of development include remnants of the vitelline duct, failure of the midgut to return to the abdominal cavity, malrotation, stenosis, and duplication of parts. Hindgut The hindgut gives rise to the region from the distal third of the transverse colon to the upper part of the anal canal. The distal part of the anal canal originates from the ectoderm. The hindgut enters the posterior region of the cloaca (future anorectal canal), and the allantois enters the anterior region (future urogenital sinus). The urorectal septum divides the two regions and breakdown of the cloacal membrane covering this area provides communication to the exterior for the anus and urogenital sinus. The upper part of the anal canal is derived from endoderm of the hindgut. The lower part (one-third) is derived from ectoderm around the proctodeum. Ectoderm, in the region of the proctodeum on the surface of part of the cloaca, proliferates and invaginates to create the anal pit. Subsequently, degeneration of the cloacal membrane establishes continuity between the upper and lower parts of the anal canal. Abnormalities in the size of the posterior region of the cloaca shift the entrance of the anus anteriorly, causing rectovaginal and rectourethral fistulas and atresias. Molecular regulation Regional specification of the gut tube into different components occurs during the time that the lateral body folds are bringing the two sides of the tube together. Different regions of the gut tube are initiated by retinoic acid (RA) from the pharynx to the colon. This RA causes transcription factors to be expressed in different regions of the gut tube. Thus, SOX2 specifies the esophagus and stomach; PDX1 specifies the duodenum; CDXC specifies the small intestine; CDXA specifies the large intestine and rectum. The differentiation of the gut and its derivatives depends upon reciprocal interactions between the gut endoderm (epithelium) and its surrounding mesoderm (an epithelial-mesenchymal interaction). Hox genes in the mesoderm are induced by SHH secreted by gut endoderm and regulate the craniocaudal organization of the gut and its derivatives. Once the mesoderm is specified by this code, it instructs the endoderm to form components of the mid- and hindgut regions, such as the small intestine, caecum, colon, and cloaca. Mesentery Portions of the gut tube and its derives are suspended from the dorsal and ventral body wall by mesenteries, double layers of peritoneum that enclose an organ and connect it to the body wall. Such organs are called intraperitoneal, whereas organs that lie against the posterior body wall and are covered by peritoneum on their anterior surface only are considered retroperitoneal. So, mesenteries are double layers of peritoneum that pass from one organ to another or from an organ to the body wall as a peritoneal ligament. Mesenteries provide pathways for vessels, nerves, and lymphatic structures to and from abdominal viscera. Initially the foregut, midgut, and hindgut are in extensive contact with the mesenchyme of the posterior abdominal wall. By the fifth week, the connecting tissue bridge has narrowed, and the caudal part of the foregut, the midgut, and a major part of the hindgut are suspended from the abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery, which extends from the lower end of the esophagus to the cloacal region of the hindgut. In the region of the stomach, it forms the dorsal mesogastrium or greater omentum. In the region of the duodenum, it forms the dorsal mesoduodenum; and in the region of the colon, it forms the dorsal mesocolon. Dorsal mesentery, of the jejunal and ileal loops, forms the mesentery proper. The ventral mesentery, located in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach and the upper part of the duodenum, is derived from the septum transversum. Growth of the liver into the mesenchyme of the septum transversum divides the ventral mesentery into the lesser omentum, extending from the lower portion of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper portion of the duodenum to the liver and the falciform ligament, extending from the liver to the ventral body wall.

Trelawny was the eldest son of Lt-Gen. Harry Trelawny and his wife, Mary Dormer. He was educated at Westminster School from 1768 to 1773 and then obtained an ensign's commission in the Coldstream Guards, in which his father was captain. He became lieutenant and captain in 1777 and captain and lieutenant-colonel in 1785. On 3 July 1786, he married Mary (d. 1852), the daughter of Thomas Hawkins. According to his younger son, the match was made for her fortune, but this was smaller than he supposed and he did not get along well with her. Becoming financially straitened, he sold his commission in the Guards in 1790 and retired to the country. He took the additional name of Brereton in 1800, having inherited Shotwick Park in Saughall from his first cousin Owen Salusbury Brereton. Although this bequest made him a rich man, his miserly behavior only worsened (perhaps stimulated by the example of his brother-in-law, Sir Christopher Hawkins), and there was considerable friction in his family life. He had six children with Mary: *Catherine Sophia Trelawny (1791–1882), married Charles Frederic Louis Dupleix, Comte de Cadignan in 1822 *Capt. Harry Brereton Trelawny (1792–1869), Grenadier Guards *Edward John Trelawny (1792–1881), adventurer *Mira Hawkins Trelawny (1796–1883), married Louis Berthold Edgard, Vicomte d'Estampes in 1825 *Charlotte Trelawny (b. 1797), married John Charles Trevanion *Caroline Trelawny (d. 1814/5) On 1 February 1808, his election to the Cornish borough of Mitchell was arranged by his brother-in-law, Hawkins, to replace the vacancy left by George Galway Mills (to whom Hawkins had given the seat to escape debtors' prison). This was merely a temporary appointment while Hawkins negotiated terms with John Bruce to take the seat, and Trelawny- Brereton took the Chiltern Hundreds in February 1809 to make way for Bruce. The election did result in the cancellation of Trelawny-Brereton's appointment as High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1808. In October 1812, Hawkins set him to contest Grampound, but he stood third at the poll, behind a coalition of Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone and John Teed. His petitions against the result failed in 1813. John Bruce retired in 1814 to head the Stationery Office in Edinburgh, and Trelawny-Brereton was again put in temporarily at Mitchell on 2 August. He took the Manor of East Hendred on 5 December 1814 to make way for Lord Binning, a government candidate. Hawkins put him up as one of two candidates at Helston at the 1818 election, but they were defeated by the interest of the Duke of Leeds. A similar result occurred in the March 1820 election. Trelawny-Brereton died suddenly that September.

The resulting fires damaged 45 homes and 16 vehicles. Background Prior to 2012, Mexican transport trucks were allowed to carry up to 80 metric tons of cargo, roughly double the limit in the United States or Europe. A series of deadly accidents, including one in April 2012 that killed 43 people, led to protests and calls for reform. In response, the federal government lowered the maximum amount of weight allowed to be carried on freight vehicles by about 4.5 tons. However, such accidents remain common. Compounding the danger, homes are often built on cheap land within a few feet of major highways. Accident Gas tanker owned by Mexican company Sonigas. The explosion was caused by a similar gas tanker On 7 May 2013, at about 05:15 local time (12:15 GMT), a gas tanker exploded on Federal Highway 85 \\"México–Pachuca\\" in Ecatepec de Morelos, a municipality in the State of Mexico about north-east of Mexico City. As a result of the accident, 27 people were killed, including 10 children, and another 31 people were injured. Among the dead was a family of four, including two children aged 11 and 6. Twenty-three people were hospitalized, eight of them in serious condition. Many of the casualties were asleep in their homes along the edge of the road at the time of the accident. The blast led to extensive fires which damaged 45 homes and 16 vehicles. Local media reports described the area as resembling a \\"war zone\\". \\"It was a ball of fire which exploded as though they'd put a spotlight in the whole window,\\" said an eyewitness. \\"We opened the door and it was like fire had blown through the whole of the garden.\\" Roughly 100 people were left homeless by the accident. Several animals were killed by the explosion, but some others were rescued. Although Pemex was not involved in the crash, the company said it would help with rescue efforts. According to early reports, the driver of the tanker, Omar Díaz Olivares, allegedly was speeding and lost control of his vehicle. He then crashed into several cars and homes before the tanker exploded. Díaz was taken to the local hospital, where he was arrested. The highway remained closed for five hours, but later a few highway lanes were opened. According to Díaz' declaration, he lost control of the tanker after he tried to evade a minivan. Aftermath President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto requested the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation, as well as Mexico Civil Protection System, to investigate the causes of the accident. Eruviel Ávila, governor of the State of Mexico, returned to Mexico. Ávila was on an official visit to Vatican City, but after the explosions he decided to cancel his trip. He announced state government-paid funeral expenses of the families of the victims, and affected people will receive MXN$50,000 (about US$5,000) to \\"rebuild their homes\\", and MXN$25,000 (about US$2,000) to buy home appliances. The company Termogas, owner of the truck, announced they will be responsible for damages, if their truck was the cause of the accident. Alfredo Martínez Torres, Secretariat of Urban Development of the State of Mexico, announced at least 110 families that live near the highway will be relocated.

He researched the history of early Spanish exploration and settlement in North America. Smith translated and published several important Spanish documents relating to this history. Thomas Buckingham Smith Waymarking.com Biography Smith was born October 31, 1810 on Cumberland Island, Georgia, the son of Josiah and Hannah Smith. When Smith's father was appointed U.S. Consul to Mexico, the rest of the family settled in St. Augustine, Florida in 1820. Smith received his early education in Florida and visited his father in Mexico when he was about fourteen. The elder Smith died in 1825 and Buckingham became the ward of his uncle, Robert Smith. Smith attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and later earned a degree from Harvard Law School in 1836. After graduation, Smith worked in the law offices of Samuel Fessenden, a politician and abolitionist. When he returned to St. Augustine in 1839 he practiced law and became involved in politics. He was a secretary to Robert R. Reid, governor of the Territory of Florida, and served one term on the Florida Territorial Legislative Council in 1841. In 1843 he married Julia Gardner of Concord, New Hampshire. In 1845 Florida was admitted as a state and the federal government was anxious to explore its economic potential. In 1847, the U.S. Senate appointed Smith to conduct a survey of the Florida Everglades. He spent five weeks performing a careful analysis of the terrain and its wildlife and submitted a report in 1848. His report is considered the first official publication on the area. In his report Smith advocated draining the swamp with a series of canals and using the reclaimed land to grow citrus crops.Raising Cane in the Glades At some point Smith became interested in the history of early Spanish exploration and settlement in America. With a desire to review the Spanish archives in Mexico, he sought and was granted an appointment to the US diplomatic delegation in Mexico in 1850. After serving there for two years, he returned home and then received an appointment as the US secretary of legation to Spain in 1855. In Spain he became friends with noted historian, Pascual de Gayangos, and continued his archival research with an emphasis on the early history of Florida. He also assisted other American historians including Francis Parkman and Hubert Howe Bancroft. He was recalled from Spain in 1858 and again returned to St. Augustine. Although Smith was a slave owner, he sided with the Union during the Civil War. In 1864 he served as a delegate at the Democratic convention in Baltimore. Shortly afterwards he returned to Spain to continue his archival studies. In 1868 Smith was back in Florida where he was appointed tax commissioner. In 1870 he moved to New York City and died there on January 5, 1871. In his will, Smith bequeathed lands to one of his former slaves and cash to others. He set aside the rest of his estate to establish the Buckingham Smith Benevolent Association with a mission to benefit current and future generations of blacks in St. Augustine. His manuscripts and library were donated to the New York Historical Society. He is listed as a Great Floridian. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1862.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Works Smith wrote on a variety of topics including Spanish exploration and colonization, Native American history, linguistics, and geography.

Kissin has been instrumental in opening a dozen restaurants in London and New York.  Restaurants Kissin met Sir Terence Conran in 1986 whist running the restaurant Hilaire. In 1987 Conran asked Kissin to join Simon Hopkinson, Hilaire's chef, to help launch Bibendum in The Michelin Building. As well as managing the ground-breaking restaurant and oyster bar, Kissin created an award-winning wine list for the restaurant.Quaglino's: The Cookbook After Bibendum, Kissin joined Conran at his new development in Butler's Wharf. Kissin and Conran first created Le Pont de la Tour at Butler's Wharf comprising a restaurant, bar & grill, food shop, wine merchant, oil and spice shop and bakery. Kissin and Conran then purchased the Quaglino's site and, with Conran, also opened Le Pont de la Tour (which in 1997 hosted a dinner for the Blairs and the Clintons) and Cantina del Ponte next door, before Quaglino's opened on Valentine's Day 1993. The restaurant \\"broke the mould\\" in that it was the largest restaurant London had ever known. It seated 350 people, was fully booked months before opening and remained so for many years. The restaurant was much emulated in London and around the world. The turnover and profitability was also record breaking for the time. The restaurant became part of the vernacular attracting much press comment. In particular it was mentioned in the TV comedy Absolutely Fabulous, as was Le Pont de la Tour. With the opening of the Butler's Wharf Chop-House in 1994, Kissin and Conran had opened three restaurants in a period of 10 months, with a combined turnover of nearly £16 million. In 1994, Kissin and Conran were jointly awarded a \\"Catey\\" as Best Independent Restaurateurs by The Caterer and Hotelkeeper Magazine. The two men continued to open restaurants in London, including Mezzo, The Orrery (with chef Chris Galvin) and the Bluebird complex, until Kissin left London in late 1997 to open Guastavino's in New York. The Kissin and Conran partnership ended in 2002.  Property development From 2002 to 2010 Kissin developed residential property in New York City and East Hampton, NY, including a 6,000 square foot brownstone on the Upper West side; a 2,600 square foot penthouse on Fifth Avenue complete with 2,500 square feet of terraces; and an 11,500 square foot mansion, on two landscaped acres, in East Hampton.  Latest project Noted as 'one of the most influential restaurateurs in Britain' Kissin returned to London to launch Boulestin, inspired by French restaurateur, author and pioneering TV presenter, Xavier Marcel Boulestin, whose eponymous Covent Garden restaurant opened in 1927 and who was the world's first TV chef on the BBC from 1937 to 1939. The new Boulestin opened on St James's Street on 2 September 2013. It comprises a 90-seat (plus outside seating) restaurant and a private dining room. Boulestin specialises in serving mostly classic French cuisine, with dishes including Soupe de Poissons, Jambon Persillé and Oeuf en Gelée plus less classic dishes such as Scallops with Grilled Octopus and Baby Fennel and Venison Loin with Crab Apples and Smoked Chestnuts. Within weeks of opening the restaurant received high praise from food critics. Describing it as \\"bang on trend\\", The Guardian's Jay Rayner asserted that \\"Marcel Boulestin would have loved his namesake restaurant.... the new Boulestin hits the mark,\\" before going on to laud the tête de veau – \\"done brilliantly\\" – and \\"a brace of perfectly cooked quail.\\" Writing in the Evening Standard, Fay Maschler singled out the \\"Oeuf en gelée rendered spectacular by the sunset yolk of a Cotswold Legbar egg,\\" whilst Time Out's Guy Dimond was delighted that \\"rather than trying to impersonate an old master, this Boulestin is a sensitively updated reproduction,\\" before commenting that \\"classic French cooking at its best shines in dishes such as daube of beef, which was slow-cooked and wonderfully tender.\\" Stephen Bayley, the esteemed author, critic, columnist, consultant, broadcaster, debater and curator concludes his experience with \\"there's nowhere in the area I would rather eat.” Zoe Williams, restaurant critic from the Telegraph, describes the restaurant as, \\"the kind of place that makes you feel like a success; like a person who has gone back to the 1930s, when ceilings were high, fittings were brass and rooms were gorgeous.\\", whilst AA Gill from the Times stated \\"The Daube de Boeuf was the best I have had in a long time\\" and \\"The food was pretty damn formidable!\\" Boulestin was sold in February 2018. Kissin was a board member of the Restaurant Association of Great Britain (RAGB) in the 1990s and was also a board member of the New York Chapter of the National Restaurant Association (NRA).

Early life Fulton was born in Warsaw, Illinois to Perry A Fulton and Luella ‘Lulu’ Chandler, but attended Keokuk High School in Iowa. After graduation, he was accepted at the University of Illinois, where he studied architecture. He graduated in 1916 with a Bachelor of Science in Architecture, then served in the U.S. Army in World War I from 1917 to 1919. After the war, Fulton gained experience working for various firms in the midwest. Fulton married the former Shirley Holmes about 1922, but the couple had no children. He read about the Florida land boom of the 1920s and recognized an opportunity. The couple moved to Florida and he secured a job in the Florida State Architect's office as a draftsman in 1926. Around that time, he was commissioned to design the springhouse and spring-fed pool at Glen Springs in Gainesville. While he was proving himself at his state job, he also took numerous freelance jobs, primarily designing private residences. He was eventually named Assistant to the Architect, and received his architect's license in 1932. Fulton became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1940. That same year, he redesigned the facility at Glen Springs, resulting in three pools with a \\"brilliant drainage system\\". Success After World War II, college enrollment increased, resulting in a building boom on the Florida campus. Beginning in 1945, Fulton served as Architect to the Florida Board of Control, designing and supervising construction of University of Florida buildings, as well as those at Florida State University and Florida A&M; University. His design theme at UF was that of a unified body of work, and his buildings used many of the same elements as his predecessors, Rudolph Weaver and William Augustus Edwards. He also established guidelines for materials and building construction for visual campus unity. He retired from the position in 1956 to work for his own firm, Guy C. Fulton & Associates. Following her death on November 29, 1990, funds from Shirley Fulton's estate were used to endow both the Guy C. Fulton Scholarship in Architecture and the Guy C. Fulton Scholarship in Engineering.

His work engages with contemporary social issues of global concern. His intimate style of committed image making, and long-term commitment to projects has earned him acclaim. Mendel has a career spanning over years. Originally from South Africa, he is currently based in London. It was his work as a ‘struggle photographer’ during the final years of apartheid that first brought attention to his work. Life and work Born in Johannesburg in 1959, Mendel studied psychology and African history at the University of Cape Town. He began photographing in the 1980s during the final years of apartheid and produced a number of bodies of work documenting the resultant societal conditions and political climate in South Africa. In the early 1990s he moved to London, from where he has continued to respond to social issues experienced globally. He travels extensively in order to do so, which is reflected by his images focusing on people and societies from countries all over the world. Most of his projects are developed over long periods of time. Video has increasingly become a part if his practice, and he also employs collaborative photography as a means of interacting with his subjects. Mendel has worked for National Geographic, Fortune, Geo, The Independent magazine, The Guardian Weekend magazine, The Sunday Times magazine, Condé Nast Traveler, L'Express, Stern and Rolling Stone. His first book, A Broken Landscape: HIV & AIDS in Africa was published in 2001. Since then he has produced a number of photographic advocacy projects, working with charities and campaigning organizations including The Global Fund, Médecins Sans Frontières, Treatment Action Campaign, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, ActionAid, the Terrence Higgins Trust, Shelter, Leonard Cheshire Disability, UNICEF and Concern Worldwide. Drowning World Since 2007, Mendel has been working on Drowning World, an art and advocacy project about flooding. Currently shortlisted for the Prix Pictet prize, it is his personal response to climate change. Mendel started the project after travelling to the UK, and then India to document the damage caused by floods a few weeks apart from each other. He was struck by the \\"contrasting effects of the flooding, and the shared vulnerability of their victims\\". He describes the project as \\"my attempt to explore the effects of climate change in an intimate way, taking us beyond faceless statistics and into the individual experiences of its victims.\\" Since beginning the project, he has documented flood damage and the impact of people living in areas affected by floods in countries including Haiti, Pakistan, Australia, Thailand, Nigeria, Germany and the Philippines. Central to the narrative of the work are the submerged portraits. The subjects' flooded homes are often used as locations, creating a disconcertingly altered environment. The full body of work consists of these portraits, as well as two further series. Flood Lines documents the impact of floodwaters of interior spaces, and Water Marks records the changes left by flood waters left on personal photographs of the victims, which Mendel photographs and collects. This work has been noted for its unusual use of portraiture, as well as its combination of photography with video pieces. Using footage from his trips, Mendel has collaborated with video makers in order to compose a series of short films. The videos accompany the photographs in the series. HIV One of the major focuses of his work is the issue of HIV/AIDS. Mendel first began documenting HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in the early 1990s. While awareness about the disease was growing rapidly at the time, antiretroviral treatment (ART) was still very difficult to access for many of the continent's poorest. As a result, the disease was having a very destructive impact on communities across the sub-continent. After covering AIDS in these areas, Mendel started to develop what has been a lifelong focus in his work. The ongoing chapter of his work on AIDS, Through Positive Eyes, is a collaborative project with the UCLA Art and Global Health Center. The project works with subjects located in seven cities around the globe, all of whom are HIV positive. The organisation describes the project as telling the \\"story of HIV/AIDS in the fourth decade of the epidemic\\" when access to treatment is \\"far from universal\\" Developed by Davide Gere at the UCLA, the workshops which form part of the project are led by fellow photographer Crispin Hughes. In this body of work, Mendel’s role has shifted from photographer to enabler, handing the camera over to HIV positive people, who he works with in order to document their stories. Apartheid Mendel belonged to part of a generation of 'struggle photographers', committed to documenting the conflict and political upheavals of the 1980s in South Africa. Employed as a news photographer, it was through covering these circumstances that he began his career. He states that in retrospect, he was 'trying to make sense of this turbulent period with no idea that change was so imminent’… and that the ‘experience has strongly influenced my approach to photography ever since'. Mendel has produced a number of bodies of work, through which he attempts to make sense of apartheid, and its continuous effect on South Africa and its people, most notably Living in Yeoville, a film which was commissioned by Okwui Enwezor for the Rise and Fall of Apartheid Exhibition.

He was known for his work on sleeping sickness, and for the Christy Report on practices very similar to slavery in Liberia in the 1920s. Early years Cuthbert Christy was born in 1863, son of Robert Christy of Chelmsford. He was educated at Olivers Mount School, in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, then won a Mackenzie bursary to the University of Edinburgh. He graduated in 1892. He travelled widely in South America and the West Indies between 1892 and 1895. He was senior medical officer to the second battalion, West African Field Force in Northern Nigeria from 1898 to 1900. He was then appointed special medical officer for plague duty in Bombay, working in the Plague Laboratory in that city. African travels Cuthbert Christy and others on a Sleeping Sickness Commission field study. Christy became a highly skilled naturalist. In 1902 he was chosen as a member of a three-man British government commission to investigate trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in Uganda. The other two were George Carmichael Low and Aldo Castellani. An epidemic of the disease was raging in Uganda, and almost 14,000 people had died by the spring of 1902. The three-man reached Kisumu in July 1902. Christie undertook a survey to create a map showing where the disease was found, travelling from place to place, taking blood samples, recording symptoms and trapping mosquitoes. Christy was a member of a team sponsored by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine that arrived in the Congo Free State on 23 September 1903 to assess public health, and sleeping sickness in particular. His companions were Joseph Everett Dutton and John Lancelot Todd, and they were joined in the Congo by Inge-Valdemar Heiberg. The team spent nine months in the Lower Congo, then on 30 June 1904 began investigating upstream as far as Kasongo. They returned to Boma on 27 February 1905. The emphasis was on the health of Europeans. Despite covering a large area, the expedition did not investigate the huge tracts where few or no Europeans were present. Christy worked in Ceylon in 1906, in Uganda and East Africa from 1906 to 1909, and then in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and the Cameroons from 1909 to 1910. In 1911 he published The African rubber industry and Funtumia elastica (\\"kickxia\\"). Between 1911 and 1914 Christy worked for the Belgian government in the Belgian Congo, mostly studying sleeping sickness. For more than a year he explored the forests to the west of Mbeni and the Rwenzori Mountains. During World War I (1914–1918), between 1915 and 1916 he worked for the Sudan government in mapping the Congo-Nile Divide, which divided the Congo from the Sudan. In part to reduce the spread of disease, the colonial authorities had imposed increasing travel restrictions on the local people. Christy observed that far more passports for cross-border travel were being issued by the Congolese authorities than by the Sudanese. He said that the main pretext was to hunt for a runaway woman, but the main reason was to trade in rubber. In 1916 Christy was appointed Advisor for Malaria to the East African Expeditionary Force. He was in charge of the military hospital in Dar es Salaam, and then in Mesopotamia. Between 1920 and 1923 Christy explored the Bahr el Ghazal in what is now South Sudan. From 1925 to 1928 he was leader of an expedition arranged by the Natural History Museum to explore the Tanganyika lakes. Christy was employed in French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa from 1928 to 1929. Christy commission In 1929 an American missionary in Liberia reported that Liberian officials were using soldiers to gather tribal people who were shipped to the island of Fernando Po as forced labourers. The Liberian government denied the charges and invited a League of Nations commission of inquiry. Cuthbert Christy headed the commission. Charles S. Johnson, a black American, was the United States representative. The former President Arthur Barclay represented Liberia. The commission began work on 8 April 1930. While Arthur Barclay remained in Monrovia for reasons of health, after six weeks Christy and Johnston left the capital and travelled first together, then separately, into the interior where they took testimony. They returned in July and conducted further interviews. Altogether the commission members heard 264 people including politicians, officials, chiefs and ordinary people. The result of the inquiries was an outspoken report submitted in September 1930. It found that the labourers had been recruited \\"under condition of criminal compulsion scarcely distinguishable from slave raiding and slave trading.\\" \\"Forced or compulsory labour\\" had been used by the government of Liberia for purposes such as road and public utility construction, and \\"...in certain cases, labour recruited...for public purposes has been diverted to private use on the farms and plantations of high Government officials and private citizens.\\" The commission also found that as recently as 1928, Liberian Government officials and Frontier Force soldiers had been \\"...raiding and forcibly recruiting native boys for shipment to the island of Fernando Po (Bioko)\\". Landowners from the island had needed manual laborers and arranged to pay Liberian \\"recruiting agents\\", including the President's brother, for the shipment of 3000 boys.\\" As a result of the Christy report, President Charles D. B. King and Vice-president Allen N. Yancy both resigned. Some authors feel that Christy was generally negative towards the role of the United States in Liberia, and interested in showing that the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company was complicit in slaving. Christie and Johnson disagreed in their interpretation of the findings, with Johnson saying that \\"His [Christy's] ... hysterical, extreme statements in summary fashion [condemned] the whole government and [called] everything slavery, slave dealing, slave traffic, etc.\\" At root was a disagreement over whether the abuses could be remedied under black self-rule, with Christy eventually coming round to Johnson's view that the country should remain independent. Although much of the work was done by the other team members, some felt that it was important to Christy to take most of the credit. Death and legacy Charles S. Johnson said soon after meeting him in 1930 that although he was 66 he \\"looks and has the heartiness of a man of 45.\\" Christy was also extremely vain. He has been called \\"a most difficult and irascible man.\\" In 1932 Christy was in the Aka River region of the Belgian Congo. He was conducting zoological investigation for the Belgian government, and was in search of elephants. He fired at a male buffalo. The wounded animal charged and gored him, and he later died of his wounds on 29 May 1932. Naja christyi, commonly known as the Congo water cobra or Christy's water cobra, is named after him, as are Chamaelycus christyi (Christy's banded snake) and Polemon christyi (Christy's snake-eater).

Born into slavery, Whitman created a successful career for himself as a writer, and during his lifetime was acclaimed as the \\"Poet Laureate of the Negro Race\\". Throughout his lifetime he worked as a manual laborer, school teacher, financial agent, fundraiser and pastor. He died in Atlanta in 1901 of pneumonia.Giemza, Bryan, Lisa Abney, Gail Galloway Adams, Gilbert Allen, Timothy D. Adams, Regina Ammon, Daniel Anderson et al. Southern Writers: A new biographical dictionary. LSU Press, 2006, p. 435. Early life and education Whitman was born into slavery at a farm near Munfordville, Kentucky. After years as a manual laborer, working at a plowshop, on railroad construction and as a teacher, Whitman attended Wilberforce University in 1870. There he studied with Bishop Daniel Payne. Whitman stated that he wrote his 1877 poem \\"Not a Man and Yet a Man\\" so that \\"he might speak more effectively for Wilberforce.\\"Benjamin Griffith Brawley, The Negro Genius: A New Appraisal of the Achievement of the American Negro, Biblo & Tannen Publishers, 1966, p. 112 Later life and family After six months at Wilberforce, Whitman left to become the financial agent for the university and an African Methodist Episcopal Church pastor in Springfield, Ohio. He later took other pastoral positions between 1879 and 1883, leading and establishing churches in Ohio, Georgia, Kansas, and Texas. He died in 1901 of pneumonia. Whitman had a wife, named Caddie, and four daughters. The daughters formed the vaudeville troupe The Whitman Sisters, who performed together from 1900 to the 1940s.Erwin Bosman, \\"The Whitman Sisters: Why We May Never Silence Them\\", NoDepression.com, September 3, 2012. Retrieved March 8, 2018. Style and influence Joan Sherman's entry in African-American Poetry of the Nineteenth Century refers to Whitman's poetry as \\"attempts at full-blown Romantic poetry\\", emulating the American and British authors from that tradition. Yet Dickson Bruce argues that \\"Whitman went beyond sentimental ideals in his understanding of literature, and even beyond the ideological directions outlined by Douglass and his colleagues.\\"Bruce, Dickson D., Black American Writing from the Nadir: The Evolution of a Literary Tradition, 1877–1915, LSU Press, 1992, p. 34. Albery Whitman's poems are not regularly reprinted in modern anthologies of Black poetry. Benjamin Brawley referred to Whitman as \\"probably the ablest of the race before Dunbar,\\"Benjamin Griffith Brawley, The Negro Genius: A New Appraisal, Biblo & Tannen Publishers, 1966, p. 110. and a recent scholar echoes this view, asserting that Whitman was \\"one of the most important African American poets between Phillis Wheatley and Paul Laurence Dunbar and probably the most prolific.\\"Whitman, Albery Allson. At the Dusk of Dawn: Selected Poetry and Prose of Albery Allson Whitman, UPNE, 2009, p. 4. In 1901, shortly before his death, Whitman published \\"An Idyl of the South: An Epic Poem in Two Parts.\\" The opening four lines suggest high romantic poetry through a sentimental reflection on the South: \\"Hail land of the palmetto and the pine,/From Blue Ridge Mountain down to Mexic's sea/Sweet with magnolia and cape jassamine,/And thrilled with song, — thou art the land for me!\\"\\"Albery Allson Whitman Poems\\", My poetic Side.

The Polyptych describes the possessions of the monastery, located primarily in the Paris region, between the rivers Seine and Eure. It lists the names of thousands of tenants and their children.  History of the text  The Polyptych text is preserved in a ninth-century manuscript, containing 20 quires that describe 25 villages or settlements, and that name more than 10,000 individuals living on these lands.Hans-Werner Goetz, 'Palaiseau.

(German) At least four other quires have been lost, together with almost all of a sister volume listing lands given in benefice. The repetition of a chapter shows that the Polyptych , in its current form, was produced from a number of working copies, and was written by about a dozen scribes. The Polyptych seems to have been based on two tours of local enquiry undertaken by monks, each one asking inhabitants a different set of questions in the estates they visited.

The liver is a vital organ, in charge of almost all the body’s metabolism. Main liver cells are hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells; each one with a specific function.  Definitions  Cytology is the name given to the branch of biology that deals with the formation, structure and functionality of the cells. Liver cytology specializes in the study of liver cells. The main liver cells are called hepatocytes; however, there are other cells that can be observed in a liver sample such as Kupffer cells (macrophages). The liver is the biggest gland of the body. It has a wide variety of functions that range from the destruction of old blood cells to the control of the whole metabolism of macromolecules. In the fetus, the liver works as a principal center for hematopoiesis, function that is later replaced by the bone marrow. This hematopoietic function is not normally seen after birth; however, in certain pathological conditions this function may still be seen. It is important to note that the liver is an essential organ and it is the only one in the body that has the ability to regenerate itself after surgery or damage.  Obtaining samples  Since cytology deals with tissues, which are composed of cells, samples of tissues must be obtained in order to analyze the cells. There are several ways of obtaining a sample, the first is through dissecting a corpse, with a sample of tissue taken during an autopsy. The second is performing an aspirate (bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). To perform an aspirate in liquid tissues, a needle is inserted inside the body and a sample is extracted. Another common method is surgery, with a piece being removed during the procedure for later analysis. Finally, another common method is biopsy. In a biopsy, a needle is inserted into the skin and a solid sample of tissue is obtained. After the sample is obtained, it has to be processed by different methods depending on the nature of the sample. Liquid samples, such as blood, are extracted and dried out, while solid samples must be dehydrated using a different combination of alcoholic compounds. The tissue must also be stained, usually with haematoxylin and eosin, a pair of colorants that identify the acidic-basic nature of the cells. After this treatment the samples are analyzed under a microscope, which can be optical or electronic, to determine if the sample is normal or pathological.  Hepatocytes  The hepatocytes are the parenchymal cells of the liver, which form the lobules. They are intimately associated with the sinusoids, which are a network of capillaries. Since they are metabolically active cells, their cytoplasm has many organelles. Hepatocytes are the main cells of the liver. They are large polyhedral cells, with six surfaces, three of which have a relevant function. The three relevant type of surfaces are sinusoidal, canalicular and intercellular. These surfaces are involved in the exchange of substances between the hepatocyte, the vessels and the biliar canaliculi. The sinusoidal surfaces are separated from the sinusoids because of the perisinusoidal space. They represent 70% of the total hepatocyte surface. They are coated by microvilli which emerge to the perisinusoidal space. These surfaces are the place where the exchange of substances between the hepatocytes and the sinusoids occurs. The canalicular surfaces are the ones through which bile drains from the hepatocytes to the canaliculi. They represent 15% of the surface of the cell. The cytoplasm of the hepatocyte near canaliculi is rich in actin filaments, and they are probably capable of modifying the canaliculi’s diameter, thus influencing the flow; however this is not yet proven. The intercellular surfaces are the ones that are between two adjacent hepatocytes and they are not in contact with sinusoids or canaliculi. These are simple surfaces specialized in the cellular adherence and in the communication between hepatocytes through gap junctions. Hepatocytes measure between 20 and 30 µm in each dimension. They are in charge of developing all the functions of the liver such as the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, as well as the processing of hormones and drugs. Hepatocytes constitute about 80% of the cell population of the liver, with the other 20% being occupied by Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesothelial cells, which are not exactly characteristic of the liver, but are present in the liver samples. Histologically speaking, hepatocytes have specific characteristics. Their nuclei are large and spheroidal, occupying the center of the cell. There is at least one nucleolus in each nucleus. In the adult liver, most of the cells are binucleated, and most of the hepatocytes are tetraploid, which means that they have four times the amount of normal DNA. Their average lifespan is from approximately five months, and hepatocytes have a significant regeneration capacity after parenchymal loss by toxic processes, diseases or surgeries. Their cytoplasm is mostly acidophilic. Basophilic regions correspond to the RER and free ribosomes. Mitochondria are abundant in hepatocytes, from 800 to 1000 per cell. They can be detected using Janus green B or enzimo-histochemistry. Hepatocytes possess multiple Golgi complexes, and have large numbers of peroxisomes, which can be detected with immunohistochemistry. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum can be extensive and may contain enzymes involved in degradation and conjugation of toxins and drugs, and other enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and lipoproteins.  Kupffer cells  Liver sinusoids are different from the rest of the body’s sinusoids since they have macrophage cells intercalated in between their endothelial cells. Kupffer cells have a different embryological origin, coming from the myeloid line in the reticuloendohelial system (also called mononuclear phagocyte system) and are related to the immune system. They first develop in the bone marrow and then migrate to the liver where they differentiate into Kupffer cells. In fact, they are the macrophages of the liver and are located in the sinusoids. Sinusoids are vascular channels that receive blood from terminal branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein and make it flow to the central veins. The space located between the endothelium is known as the Disse Space. Histologically speaking, Kupffer cells are difficult to identify; however, they are easily seen if there are stained particles that were phagocytosed. The main function of the Kupffer cells is the destruction of old blood cells that go through the liver. Hepatic stellate cells In the perisinusoidal space, a different type of cells can be found. These cells are characteristic of the liver, since they are not found in any other tissue. These hepatic stellate cells, also named lipocytes, have lipid drops in their cytosol. It is thought that these drops store a fraction of the body’s vitamin A supply. Hepatic stellate cells rest over the Remak trabecules, and they emit extensions to the sinusoids.

Packaged as a box set, it includes a booklet with a historical essay and photos from the concerts, along with individual liner notes for each show.

This is a Grateful Dead that is less about sonic exploration than it is about grooving, letting slow, easy rhythms ride out for as long as they can. At times, this does mean that \\"Fire on the Mountain\\" goes on for a very long time, taking detours into drum solos, but the comfort and ease here are appealing, along with a precision in the rhythms and solos. What impresses most is the consistency: perhaps there are slight lags in momentum along the way, but each of the five concerts is wonderfully entertaining, the sound of the Dead at something of a laid-back peak.\\" In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes said, \\"The Grateful Dead's May 8th, 1977 gig at Cornell University is widely considered the ne plus ultra of Dead bootlegs. This 14-disc set, packed in a psychedelic sarcophagus, documents five gigs from later that month. It puts the consensus-maker in perspective, occasionally rivals it and, flaws notwithstanding, shows a band on a hell of a hot streak. Compared to the hard- tripping Sixties edition, this is comfort-food Dead, long on unhurried jams and raggedy country harmonies sweetened by their only-ever female band member, Donna Jean Godchaux.\\" Track listing May 11, 1977 – St. Paul Civic Center, Saint Paul, Minnesota Disc one :First set: #\\"Promised Land\\" (Chuck Berry) – 4:54 #\\"They Love Each Other\\" (Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter) – 7:38 #\\"Big River\\" (Johnny Cash) – 6:25 #\\"Loser\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 7:39 #\\"Looks Like Rain\\" (Bob Weir, John Perry Barlow) – 9:18 #\\"Ramble On Rose\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 7:48 #\\"Jack Straw\\" (Weir, Hunter) – 5:54 #\\"Peggy-O\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) – 8:43 #\\"El Paso\\" (Marty Robbins) – 4:44 #\\"Deal\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 5:49 Disc two #\\"Lazy Lightning\\" > (Weir, Barlow) – 3:32 #\\"Supplication\\" (Weir, Barlow) –5:20 #\\"Sugaree\\" (Garcia, Hunter) –13:49 :Second set: # * \\"Samson and Delilah\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) – 7:08 #\\"Brown-Eyed Women\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 5:28 #\\"Estimated Prophet\\" (Weir, Barlow) – 8:38 Disc three #\\"Scarlet Begonias\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) – 9:47 #\\"Fire on the Mountain\\" > (Mickey Hart, Hunter) – 11:02 #\\"Good Lovin'\\" (Rudy Clark, Arthur Resnick) – 6:29 #\\"Uncle John's Band\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) – 9:11 #\\"Space\\" > (Garcia, Keith Godchaux, Phil Lesh, Weir) – 5:48 #\\"Wharf Rat\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) – 9:51 #\\"Around and Around\\" (Berry) – 8:48 :Encore: # * \\"Brokedown Palace\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 5:34 May 12, 1977 – Auditorium Theatre, Chicago, Illinois Disc one :First set: #\\"Bertha\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 7:16 #\\"Me and My Uncle\\" (John Phillips) – 3:04 #\\"Tennessee Jed\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 9:32 #\\"Cassidy\\" (Weir, Barlow) – 5:05 #\\"Peggy-O\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) – 7:52 #\\"Jack Straw\\" (Weir, Hunter) – 5:45 #\\"They Love Each Other\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 7:47 #\\"New Minglewood Blues\\" (Noah Lewis) – 5:20 Disc two #\\"Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) – 9:54 #\\"Dancing in the Street\\" (Marvin Gaye, Ivy Jo Hunter, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson) – 14:19 :Second set: # * \\"Samson and Delilah\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) – 7:07 #\\"Brown-Eyed Women\\" (Garcia, Hunter) – 5:28 #\\"Estimated Prophet\\" (Weir, Barlow) – 9:25 #\\"Sunrise\\" (Donna Jean Godchaux) – 3:46 Disc three #\\"Terrapin Station\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) – 10:13 #\\"Playing in the Band\\" > (Weir, Hart, Hunter) – 8:36 #\\"Drums\\" > (Hart, Bill Kreutzmann) – 4:06 #\\"Not Fade Away\\" > (Charles Hardin, Norman Petty) – 14:15 #\\"Comes a Time\\" > (Garcia, Hunter) – 10:20 #\\"Playing in the Band\\" (Weir, Hart, Hunter) – 7:00 :Encore: # * \\"Johnny B.

The purpose of the act was to authorize the United States Department of the Interior to facilitate the development of hydroelectric power on the Diamond Fork System of the Central Utah Project. The Central Utah Project is a United States federal water project responsible for power generation, water for irrigation and community use, flood control, and recreation. The bill would alter some of the financial requirements of building a plant in order to facilitate private development. The bill was signed into law on July 22, 2013, becoming Public Law 113-20. Background According to information provided by House Republicans, this bill was necessary to remove financial barriers that were preventing the development of hydropower in this geographic region. Additional background information can be found in House Committee Report 113-25. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act states that its goal is to facilitate hydropower development on the Diamond Fork System in Utah. In order to do this, the act would change some laws regarding the budget of the program. More specifically, one of the changes the bill makes is to say that a certain amount of reimbursable costs allocated to project power in the Power Appendix of the October 2004 Supplement to the 1988 Bonneville Unit Definite Plan Report shall be considered final costs, as well as specified costs in excess of the total maximum repayment obligation, subject to the same terms and conditions. There are several additional provisions in the bill. In section 4, it states two things. First, that the Act does not obligate the Western Area Power Administration to purchase or market any of the power produced by the Diamond Fork power plant. Secondly, the act states that none of the costs associated with development of transmission facilities to transmit power from the Diamond Fork power plant shall be assigned to power for the purpose of the Colorado River Storage Project and its ratemaking. In section 5 of the bill, it prohibits any hydroelectric power generation or transmission facility on the Diamond Fork System from being financed or refinanced with any obligation whose interest enjoys federal tax-exempt status or which enjoys certain federal tax credits. Section 6 orders the Department of the Interior to report to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources if hydropower production on the Diamond Fork System has not commenced 24 months after enactment of this Act, stating the reasons such production has not commenced, and presenting a detailed timeline for future hydropower production. Section 8 of the act restricts where the funding of these activities can come from. It prohibits the use of Western Area Power Administration borrowing authority under the Hoover Power Plant Act of 1984 to fund any study or construction of transmission facilities developed as a result of the Act. Congressional Budget Office report The Congressional Budget Office reported that it expected that enacting H.R. 254 would lead to the development of hydropower facilities at the Diamond Fork Project in Utah by a nonfederal entity within a few years, sooner than was expected under current law. Based on information CBO received from the United States Bureau of Reclamation, the CBO estimated that the federal government would receive payments from the hydropower developer of about $4 million over the 2014-2023 period. Enacting the bill would decrease direct spending (by increasing offsetting receipts); therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. Procedural history House The Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act was introduced into the House on January 15, 2013 by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT). It was referred to two House committees and one subcommittee - the United States House Committee on the Budget, the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power. The bill was passed by the House on April 9, 2013 with a vote of 400-4 in Roll Call Vote 90. One Republican and three Democrats voted against it. Senate The Bonneville Unit Clean Hydropower Facilitation Act was received in the Senate on April 10, 2013. Debate The House Republicans, on their official website, made a statement of support for the passage of H.R. 254. They argued that the bill would remove financial hurdles that are currently preventing developers from starting hydropower projects in the area due to their high costs.

Tahitoe and other leading chiefs and governors of Raiatea and Tahaa refused to accept the rule of Tamatoa V in 1858. Tamarii, the chief of the council, and others attempted to petition the United States to put the islands under an American protectorate. Letters were sent by the United States Consul to Raiatea Henry Owner to Secretary of State Lewis Cass. The diplomatic ploy was discovered by the French colonial officials in Tahiti and the Raiatean nobles scapegoated two Americans residents Joseph Jordan and Thomas Croft and a native named Poare. Tahitoe, who had not signed the request for a protectorate, opposed the secret plan and wrote to President James Buchanan saying the proposal was not approved by the people. Consul Owner was recalled by the United States for fear of French reprisal for his involvement in the affair. Tamatoa was reinstated on 4 December 1859 after he agreed to cooperate with the governors.  Biography  Tahitoe was born in 1808. He was son of prince Hihipa of Raiatea and his wife, Te-opua.

The character is depicted as a sinister businessman, primarily a foe of Iron Fist. In his original appearances in comics, he is depicted as the father of Joy Meachum and the brother of Ward Meachum. In the first season of the Iron Fist, Harold was the father of both Joy and Ward and was portrayed by David Wenham set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history Harold Meachum first appeared in Marvel Premiere #15 and was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. Fictional character biography Harold Meachum was the business partner of Wendell Rand, father of Daniel (who would later become Iron Fist). When traveling with his business partner and his young family to uncover what would be a major discovery in business, they came across K'un-L'un, a stronghold of a colony of humanoid aliens whose spaceship crashed in a pocket dimension that intersects with Earth.Marvel Premiere #15 After having left Wendell Rand, Harold began to trek back to civilization and got lost in the Himalayas. Due to the dangerous weather even upon being found by a woman and some sherpas, Harold had to have his legs amputated. Upon being told about what happened to his legs, Harold had to remain at the hut until a cart can be afforded to carry him to the airport. During this time, Harold had heard a monk talking about the K'un-L'un and about a boy who was taken in by its inhabitants upon his parents ending up dead. Knowing that the boy is Danny, Harold knew that his training would excel and that he would come to take revenge on him when the portal to K'un-L'un opens in the next 10 years. Paranoid at this, he spent the next ten years setting up death traps and hiring assassins to stop Danny Rand. He also hired Triple-Iron to be his chief assassin who kept Harold in a chamber that he will emerge from when Danny Rand is killed. On the tenth year, Harold instated a $10,000 contract to whoever can bring the wearer of the Iron Fist dragon band to him dead or alive. In other media David Wenham portrays Harold Meachum in season 1 of Iron Fist. This version is depicted as a business partner of Wendell Rand, and while Joy is still his daughter, Ward is now depicted as his son. Harold helped Danny's parents to run Rand Enterprises, but orchestrated their deaths when Wendell discovered Harold was doing shady business with The Hand. In 2004, he died of cancer, but was revived to serve the Hand while they use Rand Enterprises for their own goals. Harold is under strict control of the Hand, and Joy does not know that he is alive. He subsequently dies again at the hands of Ward, and undergoes another resurrection. Joy learns he is alive, but the repeated resurrections makes him emotionally unstable and dangerous. After Danny drives the Hand out of Rand Enterprises, he learns that Harold was behind the death of his parents, which during a showdown leads Harold to be impaled on a piece of rebar and shot twice, before falling from the roof of the company's corporate tower to his death. Danny and Ward have his body cremated.

The 3 May attack was on targets at Damascus International Airport. The 5 May attacks were on targets at Jamraya, and the Al-Dimas and Maysalun areas in Rif Dimashq (Damascus Countryside). Although officially Israel neither confirmed nor denied its involvement, former Mossad director Danny Yatom and former government member Tzachi Hanegbi inferred Israel's involvement in the attack. Official Syrian sources denied any attack on its soil on 3 May, but did accuse Israel for the attacks on 5 May. Timeline Early on 3 May 2013, several unidentified warplanes attacked a warehouse in Damascus International Airport that contained advanced surface- to-surface missiles that allegedly had been transported from Iran and were possibly bound for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. The warehouse was believed to be controlled by Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force. An unidentified American official said the missiles were Fateh-110s and two Israeli defense analysts said they included Scud Ds. Satellite images showed that two facilities on opposite sides of the airport were destroyed. In the early hours of 5 May there were further air strikes on Syria. SANA, the Syrian state news agency, said there were strikes in three places: northeast of Jamraya; the Al-Dimas air base; and at Maysalun on the border with Lebanon. Syria suggested it had been attacked with rockets. Targets of the attack Photographs handed out by SANA and video shown on Al-Manar, a Lebanese television station affiliated with Hezbollah, showed buildings destroyed by the attack on the western side of Mount Qasioun at Al-Hamah, near Jamraya, in what appeared to be a chicken farm. Analysis by Storyful identified the location, which was a mile from the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) facility at Jamraya where a 31 January 2013 airstrike destroyed a convoy in the parking lot. The same location was identified by Giuliano Ranieri. The location is at . Storyful identified this location as the site of the largest explosion in the Jamraya and Qasioun area that night. Al-Manar said the SSRC facility was not hit on this occasion and Storyful also said there was no evidence of a strike at the SSRC facility. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the air raids had killed at least 42 soldiers and another 100 were missing. Other opposition sources put the death toll at 300. A doctor at Tishreen military hospital in north Damascus said that 100 soldiers were killed in the attack.

Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Lima Group, Organization of Ibero- American States, Organization of American States, Pacific Alliance and the United Nations.  History  Historically, both nations were host to great indigenous cultures; the Aztecs and Mayas in Mexico and the Incas in Peru. During colonization, both nations were part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century. Mexico was part of Viceroyalty of New Spain while Peru was part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Diplomatic relations between Mexico and Peru were established in 1883, two years after Peru gained its independence from Spain.History of diplomatic relations between Mexico and Peru (in Spanish) In October 1892, Mexico opened its first consulate in Lima followed by the opening of an embassy on 14 June 1937.Bilateral relations between Mexico and Peru (in Spanish) In 1932, a Peruvian newspaper published a letter by Peruvian politician Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre where he talks about wanting to establish different styles of governing in Latin-America. The letter was addressed to a colleague and states the plan in detail to another friend who he sent a letter (but never arrived) via a Mexican diplomatic pouch to Lima.ASPIRACIONES ANTIIMPERIALISTAS E INTERESES NACIONALES: LAS RELACIONES EXTERIORES ENTRE MÉXICO Y PERÚ (1930-1945) (in Spanish) This letter caused such an outrage in Peru that the government accused the Mexican government of 'meddling' in its internal affairs and severed diplomatic relations with Mexico. Diplomatic relations were once again restored in 1933 with the incoming of a new president in Peru. In 1960, President Adolfo López Mateos was the first highest ranking Mexican official to visit Peru, followed by President Luis Echeverría in 1974. It wasn't until the 1990s that Peruvian Presidents Alan Garcia and Alberto Fujimori paid official visits to Mexico.

This procedure permits the holder of the intellectual property right, upon receiving the authorisation of a judge, to call upon a bailiff (in certain cases, a police commissioner or a judge) to record an infringement. In France, the saisie-contrefaçon is one of the most widely used means of obtaining evidence of the existence and extent of an infringement of intellectual property rights.See P. Véron et alii, Saisie-contrefaçon, Dalloz Référence 3rd ed. 2012; Y. Marcellin, La saisie-contrefaçon, 3rd ed., Cedat, 2001; P. Stenger, J.-CI. Commercial, Brevets, fasc. 4631, Saisie-contrefaçon.

Commercial, Dessins et Modèles, fasc. 3470, Saisie- contrefaçon.  One of the means of proof of the infringement  The infringement of intellectual property rights is a legal fact and, as such, any means may be used to provide evidence thereof. Therefore, evidence may be provided using all the means of proof permitted by civil law (or by criminal law if the proceedings are initiated before a criminal court), such as witness statements, presumptions, bailiff reports and expert investigations, but also by using the saisie-contrefaçon, a procedure specifically intended to obtain evidence of the infringement of intellectual property rights. Upon authorisation of a judge, this procedure enables the holder of an intellectual property right claiming to be the victim of a violation of this right to have the violation recorded by a bailiff authorised both to enter any place where the infringement might be observed and to seize the items of evidence of the infringement.  One of the most widely used means of proof  The saisie- contrefaçon is very efficient and often decisive in the success or failure of the infringement action;See for example, prior to the reform of 2007, P. Véron, “La saisie-contrefaçon – L'efficacité des mesures de lutte contre la contrefaçon : Étude comparée”, S.L.C / I.D.E.F., Maison du Barreau, Paris, 9 December 2005 P. Véron, “The French ‘saisie-contrefaçon’ in European litigation issues” Cross-border Litigation, Forum Institut für Management, Arabella Sheraton Grand Hotel, Frankfurt, 8 February 2002 it is therefore the most widely used means of proof in infringement cases. The remarkable effectiveness of this procedure mainly resides in that it is ex parte and restrictive. The authorisation to perform a saisie-contrefaçon is requested of the President of the tribunal de grande instance with jurisdiction over the territory in question, in ex parte proceedings. Yet Article R. 211-7 of the French Judicial Organisation CodeFrench Judicial Organisation Code, Legifrance provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for actions in the fields of Community designs and trademarks. The proceedings are ex parte, i.e. without hearing the other party: the requesting party, represented by its attorney-at-law, presents its request to the judge; the person targeted by the saisie-contrefaçon measure is not informed and does not take part in the proceedings. Therefore, the saisie- contrefaçon ordered by the judge will benefit from the element of surprise; until the very last moment, the targeted person is not informed of what is going on and therefore cannot move or dispose of the evidence of its infringing activity (the result is the same when, in matters of copyright and related rights, a police commissioner, or even a judge, is requested to carry out a saisie-contrefaçon, see French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1 and L. 332-4French Intellectual Property Code, Legifrance). The great practical effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon also lies in its restrictive nature, since the judge, by granting an order to perform a saisie-contrefaçon, authorises the requesting party to call upon a bailiff to enter the premises of the targeted person or even of third parties (if evidence is likely to be found there) to perform the saisie-contrefaçon investigations, regardless of whether or not the premises are normally open to the public. The saisie- contrefaçon is generally decisive in the success or failure of the action for infringement. If it is correctly performed and cannot be challenged or remains unchallenged, it will provide evidence of an infringement for which the judge ruling on the merits in the infringement proceedings cannot but pronounce civil or criminal sanctions, thereby ensuring the success of the holder of the intellectual property right over the infringer. If it is incorrectly performed, challenged and declared void, it generally leads to the failure of the infringement action on the merits as it fails to produce evidence of the infringement. All other means of proof certainly remain effective in theory, but in practice, they are far from being as efficient as the saisie- contrefaçon, to the extent that the failure of the saisie-contrefaçon often means that the infringement action will fail. Considering the decisive nature of the saisie-contrefaçon, the dispute with relation to its being valid or void is very significant. The alleged infringer, in addition to arguing that the intellectual property right at issue is invalid, will naturally tend to put forward any and all arguments supporting the nullity of the saisie- contrefaçon, in order to destroy such a decisive item of evidence against it. The ex parte and restrictive nature of the saisie-contrefaçon, which makes it so efficient, can also be perceived as a possible source of abuse. It is possible that an economic operator might be tempted, under the pretext of the alleged infringement of its intellectual property right, to misuse the saisie- contrefaçon procedure in order to enter the premises of a competitor and try to obtain some of its industrial and trade secrets. However, first of all, in order to avoid such a risk, the judge has the option of preserving the confidentiality of the information gathered during the saisie-contrefaçon.P. Véron, “Documents confidentiels appréhendés lors d'une saisie-contrefaçon”, note under TGI Paris, 6 December 1996, order of the Judge in charge of the case preparation dated 2 October 1997, order in preliminary proceedings dated 24 November 1997, RDPI No. 83, January 1998 Moreover, it is an established principle that the saisie-contrefaçon investigations are the responsibility of the requesting party and that the judge, when rendering the order for a saisie-contrefaçon, can order the requesting party to furnish security to compensate the seized party for any loss it may suffer, in case it later appears that the saisie-contrefaçon was abusive. Practitioners are aware of these rules which the courts apply with great care, and abuses are the exception.  By anyone having standing to sue for infringement  Since French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007,French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007 ; cf. P. Véron, “La nouvelle saisie-contrefaçon – Transposition de la directive sur le respect des droits de la propriété intellectuelle”, AAPI/CCI, International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, 21 November 2007 this expression is used in almost all the articles of the French Intellectual Property Code relating to the saisie-contrefaçon to refer to the person entitled to request it. Simply put, the persons having standing to request a saisie-contrefaçon are generally the holders of the allegedly infringed intellectual property right and the exclusive licensees – after the right holder has been notified and yet taken no action. The person having standing to request the saisie-contrefaçon does not have to provide evidence of the alleged infringement as the saisie-contrefaçon precise goal is to gather evidence. However, the requesting party must duly justify both the existence of an intellectual property right in force and its standing to request the saisie-contrefaçon.  In order to obtain evidence of the infringement  The saisie-contrefaçon order handed down by the judge authorises the requesting party to dispatch the bailiff of its choice, possibly accompanied by an expert,P. Véron, “Indépendance de l’expert assistant l’huissier instrumentaire lors d’une saisie-contrefaçon”, note under Com., 18 April 2000 and Civ. 1st 6 July 2000, Recueil Dalloz, 2001, jur. p. 370 of its choice or by a member of the police force, to any place where proof of the infringement might be found, to make either a “detailed description” of the elements found in his report – a description that can be accompanied by the taking of samples – or a “physical seizure”, i.e. the confiscation of the elements found and attached to the report, again drafted by the bailiff to record the operations performed. The saisie-contrefaçon may relate to infringing products, documents relating to the infringement but also materials and implements used in the production or diffusion of the infringing goods. In the particular field of copyright and related rights, illustrating the sometimes more protective than probative nature of the saisie-contrefaçon (see below France – Background), the President of the competent tribunal de grande instance may also order the following: the suspension of any manufacturing in progress involved in the unlawful reproduction of a work (or of the object of a related right) or in the violation of the protection or information technical measures; the seizure of monetary proceeds from any reproduction, performance or diffusion, by whatever means, of an intellectual work (or of the object of a related right) carried out in violation of the author’s rights or deriving from a violation of the protection or information technical measures; the handing over to a third party of the unlawful works or the products suspected of being unlawful in order to prevent that they be introduced or circulated in commercial channels (French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1French Intellectual Property Code, Legifrance).  Evidence of the existence and extent of the infringement  The elements that can be gathered from the saisie-contrefaçon can be useful for proving both the existence of the alleged infringement (for example by taking samples of the infringing products) and the extent thereof (in particular by making copies of accounting documents of the person accused of infringement, which make it possible to assess the infringing sales and the economic damage suffered by the holder of the infringed intellectual property right).  Evidence of the infringement of intellectual property rights  Since French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007, a saisie-contrefaçon may be performed for all intellectual property rights (see French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1 - copyright and related rights, Art. L. 332-4 – software and databases, Art. L.°343-1 –sui generis right of the producer of databases, Art. L. 615-5 – patents, Art. L. 521-4 – designs, Art. L. 622-7 – topographies of semiconductor products, Art. L. 623-27-1 – plant variety rights, Art. L. 716-7 – trademarks, Art. L. 722-4 – geographical designationsFrench Intellectual Property Code, Legifrance). Yet the saisie- contrefaçon is not subject to a single unified legal regime. The French Intellectual Property Code contains, for every intellectual property right, an article that specifically applies to the saisie-contrefaçon. While the saisie- contrefaçon regime, thus spread between so many different articles and different rights, is very homogeneous in the field of industrial property, it is quite different and much less homogeneous in the field of literary and artistic property.See prior to the reform instituted by Act French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007,.I. Romet, « La saisie-contrefaçon, unité et diversité. Neuf propositions pour harmoniser la saisie-contrefaçon », JCP – Cahiers de droit de l’entreprise, n° 4/2004, p. 29 et s. , supplément à La Semaine Juridique - JCP n° 42 du 14 octobre 2004.  France – Background  The saisie-contrefaçon was introduced into French law by the Decree of 19–24 July 1793, which is the first general text concerning the rights of authors of intellectual works, for the protection of the right of reproduction (it was not applicable in the case of a violation of a performance right). At that time, only police commissioners and Justices of the Peace (the predecessors of instance court judges) were entitled to carry out a saisie-contrefaçon. The saisie-contrefaçon was conceived more as a type of protective measure (and was characterised as such by previous laws) than as a probative measure. The saisie-contrefaçon therefore had a monitoring and even criminal and protective nature, certain traits of which have remained in practice (for example, deposit of the seized objects at the court clerk’s office). The remarkable effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon led to its progressive extension – recently through French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007 – to all intellectual property rights, its criminal and protective nature correspondingly tending to diminish in favour of a probative nature. Today, the saisie-contrefaçon has an exclusively probative nature, except in the field of copyright and related rights where, for the historical reasons set out above, it has also retained its protective nature.  Europe  Prior to Directive No. 2004/48/EC,Directive (2004/48/EC of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, OJEU No. L. 157 of 30 April 2004 (html) (pdf) the saisie-contrefaçon was only known as such in France and in Belgium (where it was rather referred to a “saisie-description”.Cf. See F. de Visscher, P. Bruwier, La saisie-description et sa réforme – Chronique de jurisprudence 1997-2009, Larcier, coll. Les dossiers du Journal des tribunaux, 2010; , est notamment disponible un extrait faisant une présentation générale de la réforme de la saisie description belge en 2007) (descriptive seizure)). Certain countries employed measures that could have a relatively similar practical effect (Italy,Article 161 of Italian Act of 22 April 1941 relating to copyright and related rights (Legge 22 aprile 1941, n. 633 ) Articles 128 to 130 of the Italian Industrial Property Code ((Codice della proprieta industriale, Decreto Legislativo 10 febbraio 2005, n. 30) Spain,Article 297 du Article 297 of the Spanish Intellectual Property Code or even the United Kingdom with the Anton Piller orders). However, other countries had no specific probative measure in the field of infringement, which was a serious obstacle to the enforcement of intellectual property rights. The saisie- contrefaçon is a probative measure now intended to exist in all the member states of the European Union as a result of Directive No. 2004/48/EC. The Community legislator took as a basis the French saisie-contrefaçon as well as the Anton Piller ordersSee. Th. Bouvet, M.

Sanayev, a Moscow Art Theatre (and later Mossovet Theatre) actor, was honored in 1969 with the People's Artist of the USSR title; among his other accolades are the Order of Lenin (1971) and the Order of the October Revolution (1981). Biography Vsevolod Sanayev was born on 25 February 1912 in Tula. In 1926 — 1930 he worked as a bayan technician at the Tula factory of musical instruments. After a short stint at a local theatre, in 1931 he was invited to join the Tula- based Gorky Theatre of Drama and Comedy and soon enrolled in the Russian Institute of Theatre Arts. After the graduation in 1937 he joined the Moscow Art Theatre troupe. In 1938, he debuted on screen in the film Volga-Volga (where he had two minor roles), and in 1940 enjoyed his first success as Dobryakov in the film The Girl I Love. In 1943, Sanayev joined the Mossovet Theatre and in 1952 moved to the Moscow Art Theatre. The mass popularity came to Sanayev in the 1950s and 1960s; among his best known roles were Kantaurov in The Return of Vasily Bortnikov (1952), Dontsov in The First Echelon (1955), Kozlov in Five Days, Five Nights (1960), Siply (Husky) in An Optimistic Tragedy (1962); later Colonel Lukin in the war epic Liberation (1968), Professor Stepanov in Pechki-lavochki (1972), and Colonel Zorin (The Return of St. Luca, 1970; The Black Prince, 1973, and The Version of Colonel Zorin, 1978).

Location Ibitipoca State Park has area of and is situated from the district of Conceição do Ibitipoca (which is sustained by tourism attracted by the park). It was created on 4 July 1973 and is administered by the Instituto Estadual de Florestas of Minas Gerais. It is in the municipality of Lima Duarte. Entry to the park is charged and is limited to 300 visitors per day during the week and 800 at weekends and on holidays. Camping is permitted in the park but this is also limited to a certain number of visitors and only in the designated site. The camp site has a restaurant, café and lavatories.  Toponym  \\"Ibitipoca\\" derives from the Tupi and signifies \\"burst mountain, from the terms ybytyra (\\"mountain\\") e pok (\\"burst\\").  Climate and vegetation  The climate is humid subtropical, with mild rainy summers and dry winters. The park is on an outcrop of quartzite with a shallow soil (Cambisol) layer made up principally of organic material and sand formed by the erosion of the rock. Because of this a large part of the vegetation is Xerophyte, comprising true grasses and low growing herbaceous plants. In the regions where the soil is shallow are bushes, cactuses and bromeliads characteristic of rocky places. The rivers of the park are caramel coloured because of high levels of organic material.  Attractions  The main attractions are the caves, mountains and waterfalls. The highest point in the park is known as Pico da Lombada and is a little more than above sea level. Some tourist spots are the Janela do Céu, Cachoeirinha, Pico do Pião, Cruzeiro, Lago dos Espelhos, Cachoeira dos Macacos and Cachoeira da Pedra Quadrada. A trip to the park is characterized by long walks—the return walk to the Janela do Céu, for example, is about and The Cachoeirinha is from the camp site. Pico da Lombada has an interesting characteristic: The view from there to the horizon is 360°—one can see to the horizon in whichever direction as no mountain stands in the way.  Access  Access is by a road of about off of the main BR-267 road in Lima Duarte to the village of Conceição de Ibitipoca. Part of the track is by dirt road but its steepest stretch between the Fazenda do Engenho and the village is paved as it is in other places. from the village to the park is a further on paved road. In the rainy season this access can be difficult due to poor maintenance of the road.

Early life Alfred Pichler was born in Oštrelj near Drvar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Anton and Matilda (née Helk) Pichler. He had finished elementary school in Šipovo and Prijedor where he also attended six years of gymnasium, then he went to the minor seminary in Travnik. He continued studying at the University of Catholic Theology in Sarajevo where he was ordained deacon by Ivan Šarić on 20 February 1937. Priesthood Pichler was ordained to the priesthood on 13 March 1937 in the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Sarajevo. He first served as a chaplain in Banja Luka, and then as a parish priest in Novi Martinac. During the Second World War, he had to escape from Chetniks to Bosanski Aleksandrovac. After the war ended, from May 1945 to March in 1946, he was situated with other Germans in a camp in Bosanski Aleksandrovac. He was administrator of parishes in Nova Topola, Bosanski Aleksandrovac and Mahovljani from the autumn 1946 until spring 1952. Communist authorities accused Pichler of \\"enemy propaganda\\" and imprisoned him until April 1954. After his release until the appointment of the bishop, he served as parish priest of Prnjavor. Episcopal ministry On 22 July 1959, Pichler was appointed Bishop of Banja Luka by Pope John XXIII. He received his episcopal consecration from Franjo Šeper, with Smiljan Franjo Čekada and Matija Zvekanović serving as co-consecrators on 18 October 1959. During his episcopal service, Bishop Pichler left a deep mark and he specially devoted himself up to the upbringing and education of priests. Thus, during his ministry, 34 priests were ordained and three priests from his diocese became bishops (Franjo Komarica, Vinko Puljić and Severin Pernek). He established 9 new parishes: Ravska (1967), Dragalovci (1970), Mariastern (1973), Odžak-Čaić (1975), Raljaš (1977), Trn (1980), Budžak (1983) and Motike (1983). He participated in the Second Vatican Council as a member of the Commission for the liturgy. Being the president of the Liturgical board of Yugoslavia he has greatly contributed the restoration of the Roman liturgy after the Council. Because he had cordial relationships with local Orthodox Christians, pope John Paul II appointed him member of the International Catholic-Orthodox episcopal commission. On 15 May 1989, he retired from the ministry and until his death remained bishop emeritus of Banja Luka. He died on 17 May 1992, and was buried two days later at the cathedral.

The goal of the HNRCA, which is managed by Tufts University, is to explore the relationship between nutrition, physical activity, and healthy and active aging.http://www.ars.usda.gov/Business/Business.htm?modecode=19-50-00-00  History  In the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, Congress directed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a comprehensive human nutrition research program and to study the potential cost and value of regional research centers for nutrition. The Agriculture Appropriations Bill, passed later in 1977, instructed the USDA to establish an “adult” human nutrition research facility at Tufts University in Massachusetts. On August 1, 1979, the Cooperative Agreement between Tufts University and the USDA was signed, and on October 23 of the same year, the National Institute on Aging and the USDA signed a Memorandum of Understanding detailing their mutual interest in the HNRCA at Tufts University. Tufts University donated land from its Boston campus for the HNRCA. It is run by cooperative agreement between the ARS and Tufts University.  Contributions to society  The HNRCA is one of the largest research centers in the world studying nutrition and physical activity in healthy and active aging and the prevention of age-related disease. It has made significant contributions to U.S. and international nutritional and physical activity recommendations, public policy, and clinical healthcare.http://www.larrl.ars.usda.gov/recovery/boston.htm?pf=1 These contributions include advancements in the knowledge of the role of dietary calciumhttp://www.larrl.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?seq_no_115=161786 and vitamin D in promoting nutrition and bone health, the role of nutrients in maintaining the optimal immune responsehttp://www.larrl.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?seq_no_115=234162 and prevention of infectious diseases, role of diet in prevention of cancer, obesity research,http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar06/research0306.pdf modifications to the Food Guide Pyramid,http://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/ollibesmart/tufts-myplate-for-older- adults/ contribution to USDA nutrient data bank, advancements in the study of sarcopenia, heart disease,http://www.fshn.hs.iastate.edu/nutritionclinic/handouts/newsletters/BerrySeason.pdf vision, brain and cognitive function, front of packaging food labeling initiatives,http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=8710 and research of how genetic factors impact predisposition to weight gain and various health indicators.

He was the Mayor of Vitoria-Gasteiz, from 2011 to 2015, the capital city of the Basque Country and of the province of Álava. At the same time, he served as member of the Basque Parliament and in 2016 he was elected Member of the Congress of Deputies until 2019. Biography Maroto was born in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country, on 6 January 1972.

The Act repealed the previous pilotage legislation in its entirety, the Pilotage Act 1983, which itself had repealed the Pilotage Act 1913. Content of the act The act requires competent harbour authorities (CHA) to keep under consideration what pilotage services are needed to secure the safety of ships and gives them powers to: * make pilotage compulsory within their pilotage district and levy charges for the use of a pilot; * grant pilotage exemption certificates (PEC) to any bona fide master or first mate who has the skill, experience or local knowledge to pilot their own ship in a compulsory pilotage area; and, * authorise pilots within their district. The act requires the Secretary of State to maintain a list of CHAs, and also allows the Secretary of State to authorise other bodies to grant deep sea pilotage certificates in respect of such part of the sea falling outside the harbour of any CHA. Competent harbour authority The act established the definition of a CHA as any harbour authority that has statutory powers relating to the regulation of shipping movements and the safety of navigation. Initially, a CHA also had to be one whose harbour was wholly or partly within a pilotage district where at least one act of pilotage had been performed, or where a PEC had been in force, between 1984 and 1987. However, the act provided a procedure by which other harbour authorities could be assigned CHA status. Impact of the act Prior to this act, Trinity House was responsible for the provision of local pilots for entering ports. Today, the Corporation of Trinity House is one three authorised bodies responsible for deep sea pilotage, working closely with Trinity House Newcastle upon Tyne and Trinity House Hull to examine and license deep sea pilots. Following the Sea Empress disaster in 1996, the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions undertook a review of the Act which concluded that \\"Pilotage should rightly remain the responsibility of the CHAs and become integrated with other port marine activity under the management and responsibility of one Statutory Authority\\". The principal recommendation of the Review was for the establishment of the Port Marine Safety Code, which was first published in 2000. The act has been amended by the Marine Navigation Act 2013 to: * provide a mechanism for a CHA to relinquish its duties and powers in respect of pilotage; * permit pilotage exemption certificates to be awarded to a bona fide deck officer (qualified as before by reference to skill, experience and local knowledge); and, * tighten powers on the use, suspension and revocation of pilotage exemption certificates.

Publisher and editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung, Sonnemann also served as a deputy to the Reichstag and was a founding member of the German People's Party. Sonnemann was \\"a large, portly man, with whiskers like Lord Dundreary,\\" wrote an English contemporary, but \\"he dresses with a neatness and elegance quite un-Teutonic.\\" Career Leopold Sonnemann was born to Jewish parents in Höchberg, Bavaria, in 1831.Tuttle, p. 194. Well-educated in his youth, he became an astute businessman and organizer. He built upon his family business and amassed enough wealth by 1856 to purchase a Bavarian market publication, the Neue Frankfurter Zeitung. Rechristening it to simply Frankfurter Zeitung, Sonnemann devoted himself wholeheartedly to the paper as owner, editor, and contributing writer. The paper developed an influential position in the business community of southern Germany. Sonnemann was an active organizer and an effective orator. Though he could be clinically described as a social democrat, Sonnemann projected a highly individualized political presence which was regarded by contemporaries as somewhat esoteric.Tuttle, pp. 195–198.

It was developed by Roderick and Joyce Cameron in the 1950s, and features an Italian garden. It opened to the public in 1968, and now holds regular garden festivals and outdoor theatre productions. History The Lion Summerhouse within the garden Great Comp Garden is the creation of the late Roderick and Joyce Cameron (formerly Joyce Trafford Riggall), after they moved to the 17th Century Manor in 1957 (which has been Grade II* listed since 1952), with the idea of developing the garden into a plantsman’s delight. The house was once a farmhouse, the stables has been converted into the Old Dairy Tearooms. They originally started with 4.5 acres, and in 1962 and 1975 added more land to the garden. They created an Italian Garden, explorable 'ruins' and 'temple' (all hand built by Roderick), using sand and stone from the garden. The ruins and statuary (including Pope's Urn and Longleat Urn), add interesting focal points to the densely planted garden. The garden has very good displays of magnolias (they have over 30 varieties of this shrub),Azaleas, salvias, crocosmias, dahlias and other exotic plants in the region. They have planted up to 380 shrubs and trees in the garden. The garden first opened up to the public in 1968. It had an entrance fee of 10p and had around 200 visitors on the opening days. The garden then opened for the National Garden Scheme, which it still opens on certain days for. In 1980, Roderick was elected to the RHS Council. Which he greatly enjoyed, despite the numerous disagreements with various RHS members. The storms of 1987 and 1990 caused major damage to the garden. But Roderick and Joyce turned this tragedy into a positive by planting more plants. When his wife died in 1992, Roderick set up the Great Comp Charitable Trust to keep the garden open and running. He stayed in the house until he was 90 and then moved to a local residential home but died after a short illness. 286118 After Roderick died, the trust sold several items from inside the house including a George III sycamore tea caddy and ivory and horn-veneered miniature chess table. William Dyson then took over management of the gardens in 2000, as a curator. He previously had managed a Salvia Nursery within the garden, for twenty years. As well as exhibiting at the Chelsea Flower Show. Great Comp has four annual special events including a Spring Plant Fair, Summer outdoor theatre and an Autumn Plant Fair\\\\garden festival. The Coull Quartet have regularly played in the garden during summer classical music festivals. They played on September 5, 12 and 18 in 2010 (after the death of Roderick Cameron). The gardens regular hold garden festivals. In 2013, they had the 11th Garden Festival. The garden also is a venue for outdoor theatre productions, such as William Shakespear's The Comedy of Errors, starring Jake Hendriks in 2011. Then in 2012, As You Like It.

History The Grade II listed Victorian mansion was built in 1870 for Sir John Croft (son of Sir John Croft, 1st Baronet ) by the architect Charles Brown Trollope. In 1873, Markham Nesfield (1842-74),(son of the better known garden designer William Andrews Nesfield) designed the formal terrace next to the house for Sir John Croft. Unfortunately nothing remains now of his detailed planting plans. In 1906, the Crofts sold Doddington Place and the estate to General and Mrs. Douglas Jeffreys. Who added the rock garden and she was also responsible for planting about a mile of box hedging. Then their nephew inherited the estate, John Richard Anthony Oldfield (MP) and his wife Jonnet Elizabeth Richards added to the garden. He died aged 100 at Doddington. The current owner is Richard Oldfield, cousin of John Oldfield, Richard Oldfield is the Executive Chairman of the asset management company Oldfield Partners and is the Vice Lord Lieutenant of Kent, as well as being the President of the Faversham Society. The estate suffered extensive damage in the Great Storm of 1987. Around 60 trees were damaged in the garden alone. The gardens have been open in aid of the National Gardens Scheme for more than fifty years. Description The gardens consist of a large woodland garden, with a collection of rhododendrons and azaleas. Other features include an Edwardian rock garden with pools (currently undergoing extensive renovation), a formal sunken garden with herbaceous borders, and a flint and brick folly at the end of a long grass walk. It was described by Sir Roy Strong as a 'piece of Hampton Court'. The garden also has extensive lawns and avenues are bordered by large clipped yew hedges and many old trees. The garden has featured in numerous magazine and newspaper articles and twice on TV on ITV Meridians 'Country Ways' programme. It has also been the scene of episodes in the television series Perfect Scoundrels (with Peter Bowles) and featured in 'Great Houses Cookery' (by Michael Barry). Part of the film Waterland, starring Jeremy Irons and Natasha Richardson, was also filmed within the gardens. The Victorian mansion was used as the ancestral home to Tom Crick (played by Irons). The garden has been used several times to host operas. In 2009, 'The Marriage of Figaro' was performed by The Opera Project (including Nick Garrett in aid of the Kent Association for the Blind.

Alt URL Its main purpose is to significantly reduce hunger and poverty in Mexico through social intervention, increasing the general socio economic status of the communities by the development of infrastructure. It was announced on December 1, 2012 by Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto during his inauguration. The program started on January 21, 2013 with an event in Las Margaritas, Chiapas. Objectives CruzadaNacionalContraElHambre The program is based on five principal objectives, centered on hunger, food production and community participation. The two hunger objectives are to eliminate hunger in extremely impoverished communities, and eradicate acute malnutrition in children. The two food production objectives are to cut down losses of after harvesting, and of food in storage, transportation, distribution, and commercialization; as well as to increase both food production, and the profit of farmers. Finally, the last objective is to promote community participation to achieve the other four objectives. The Secretariat of Social Development (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social or SEDESOL) is responsible for the program to help 7.4 million Mexicans with hunger in 400 municipalities. This will be done with the cooperation of federal, state and municipal programs, such as the PROCAMPO campaign sponsored by SAGARPA, the online organization sinhambre.org, various local communities. The crusade will also include the production of photography, short films, mural paintings, and music contests, with April named as the Month of the Crusade. Intersectoral Commission  According to the Article Six of the Decreto por el que se establece el Sistema Nacional para la Cruzada contra el Hambre, the Intersectoral Commission coordinates programs and actions to accomplish the five main objectives of the Crusade. The commission is formed by the secretaries of 16 state secretariats and three national social institutions. It is presided by Rosario Robles Berlanga, minister of SEDESOL. Associated companies and institutions Different institutions, companies and associations have affiliated to work with the program. These include universities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and multinational food companies. Four of the most important universities in Mexico have agreed to work with the program: the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM) (Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey or ITESM) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). Students in these universities will be able to complete their social service in the communities being served by the program. UAM is in charge of the pilot program in the state of Guerrero, while UNAM's participation focuses on social research. Participating NGO's include \\"A Kilo of Help\\" (Un kilo de Ayuda or UKA) which will help by focusing attention on the children's program. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross will help through eight defined actions: an educative program for preventative health, and life of children; nutrition education; the creation of the basic workshop on collection centers; urban garden and house technology and a children's workshop on alimentary habits. Mexican Red Cross will also help with logistics and distribution of basic needs, census-taking, and evaluation of damages in case of disasters, health caravans, food delivery and the Ruta contra el hambre (Route against hunger) in 120 municipalities. The multinational companies are Nestlé and PepsiCo. Nestlé will donate 200 thousand hours in formative nutrition courses in the communities, help 15 thousand homeowners to become micro-enterprises, as well as help in the agricultural development of their milk and coffee providers. Similarly, PepsiCo will help in the development of scientific advances in food products, the creation of sustainable productive projects in poor communities, with product donation, as well as aiding in case of disaster in any of the communities in the program. Accomplishments In April 2013, a series of agreements were signed including those with the universities, NGO's, multinational corporations. Additionally, the Integral Agreement for the Inclusive Social Development- National Crusade Against Hunger was signed with the governor of the Mexican state of Hidalgo. This was done to further align the already existing programs with the Crusade. Moreover, the official “starting signal” was given on April 19 by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Zinacantán, Chiapas, which will deploy the first groups of the crusade to gather information of the needs in the communities. Finally, the programs for the following months of the Crusade were established. Some of these include the “Observer Children” program, which donates cameras to children to document the changes in their communities. Another program is the Nutritional Orientation Networks “The Crusades” to educate 500 thousand women on the importance of nutrition, growth and development on children. The Crusade began work on January 21, 2013 in two communities in the Mexican state of Guerrero: the municipality of Mártir de Cuilapán, and the neighborhood of Simón Bolivar, Acapulco. In Mártir de Culiapán, campaigns for water accessibility, reforestation, and temporary employment were implemented with involvement of the community. Meanwhile, in the neighborhood of Simón Bolivar, an oral health day was organized with the help of odontology residents from the Autonomous University of Guerrero along with a temporary employment program, which created 150 jobs for the people of the community, working with the Mexican Army to clean a river that flows through the neighborhood. Criticism Because of the size and ambition of the program, it has received some criticism by politicians of the opposition and academics alike. For example, Gonzalo Hernández Licona, president of National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social or CONEVAL) has stated that the reduction of poverty is impossible if only social programs are implemented. He adds that economic growth is also required. Additionally he mentioned the difficulty of coordinating various independent social programs towards the same end. He fears the program has political-electoral interests, as many of the communities are governed by the opposition parties. José Luis de la Cruz Gallegos, director of the Research Center for Economy and Business at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico wrote an article pointing out many of the challenges the Crusade must overcome. Firstly, he points out that while food will be provided, nutrition is not properly accounted for. Especially, since food consumption in the rural and urban communities is very different. He adds that there is a problem not only with unemployment, but also the lack of education. He says that it will be impossible to maintain a stable economy in the communities if there is no improvement in education. Finally, he mentions that the crusade must maintain long term social development, promoting the growth of communication, transport, security, public education, public health, water disponibility, the agricultural sector, economy, and job security. However, the program has received mixed reviews from international organizations as FAO. According to FAO's general director, Jose Graziano da Silva, the Crusade has all the ingredients for success, and it has been criticized for its apparent political use, as “Hambre Cero”, a similar social program from Brazil proposed Da Silva. According to him, Mexico has a lot of potential, but is lacking emphasis on food production, even though Mexico is one of the greatest agricultural producers in the world.

Nike Ajax was designed to attack conventional bomber aircraft flying at high subsonic speeds and altitudes above . Nike was initially deployed in the US to provide defense against Soviet bomber attacks, and was later deployed overseas to protect US bases, as well as being sold to various allied forces. Some examples remained in use until the 1970s. Technological development during the 1950s quickly rendered the MIM-3 obsolete. It was unable to defend against more capable bombers or multiple targets in formation, and had relatively short range. Even while Nike was being deployed, these concerns led to the contracts for the greatly improved MIM-14 Nike Hercules, which began deployment in 1959. As Hercules developed, the threat moved from bombers to ICBMs, and the LIM-49 Nike Zeus anti-ballistic missile project started to address these. All of the Nike projects were led by Bell Labs, due to their early work in radar guidance systems during World War II. Originally known simply as Nike, it gained the Ajax as part of a 1956 renaming effort that resulted from the introduction of Hercules. It was initially given the identifier SAM-A-7 (Surface-to-air, Army, design 7) as part of an early tri-service identification system, but later changed to MIM-3 (Mobile Interceptor Missile, design 3) in 1962.Western Electric SAM-A-7/M1/MIM-3 Nike AjaxNike was initially designated SAM-G-7, and later changed to SAM-A-7. Originally the Air Force used A while the Army used G, but the Air Force abandoned the 1947 tri-service designation system in 1951 and the Army took over the A designation. Part of the Nike Ajax development program designed a new solid fuel rocket motor used for the missile's booster. This had originally been designed for the US Navy's missiles, and was enlarged for the Nike efforts. The rocket was so useful that it found numerous applications outside the military world as the Ajax missiles were decommissioned in the 1960s. Many sounding rockets used the booster as their first or second stage, and many of those used \\"Nike\\" in their name. History Background The inherent inaccuracy of anti-aircraft artillery means that when shells reach their targets they are randomly distributed in space. This distribution is much larger than the lethal radius of the shells, so the chance that any one shell will successfully hit the target is very small. Successful anti-aircraft gunnery therefore requires as many rounds to be fired as possible, increasing the chances that one of the rounds will get a \\"hit\\". During The Blitz, UK gunners fired 49,044 shells in January 1941 for 12 kills, almost 4,100 shells per success.Ian White, \\"The History of Air Intercept Radar & the British Nightfighter\\", Pen & Sword, 2007, p. 75. German gunners against daylight raids did better, estimating that an average of 2,800 shells was required to down a single Boeing B-17. Flying faster means that the aircraft passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, reducing the number of rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes often has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines roughly double the speed and altitude over piston-powered designs, limiting the number of shells so greatly that the chance of hitting the bomber dropped almost to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were keenly aware of the problem, and expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns. The western allies maintained air superiority for much of the war and their anti-aircraft systems did not see as much pressure to improve. Nevertheless, by the mid-war period, the US Army had reached the same conclusion as their German counterparts; flak was simply no longer useful. Accordingly, in February 1944 the Army Ground Forces sent the Army Service Forces (ASF) a request for information on the possibility of building a \\"major caliber anti-aircraft rocket torpedo\\". The ASF concluded that it was simply too early to tell if this was possible, and suggested concentrating on a program of general rocket development instead. The introduction of German jet-powered bombers late in 1944 led to a re-evaluation of this policy, and on 26 January 1945 the Army Chief of Ordnance issued a requirement for a new guided missile weapon system. The request was passed to Bell Labs, then a world leader in radar, radio control and automated aiming systems (see Hendrik Wade Bode). Project Nike Bell accepted the challenge, and Project Nike was officially formed on 8 February 1945. The Bell team was given the task of attacking bombers flying at or more,Cagle says 600 mph, but many other sources put it at 500 or more. at altitudes between , and performing a 3G turn at . Bell reported back on 14 May 1945 (and a formal report the next day) that such a development was indeed possible. They concluded that: > A supersonic rocket missile should be vertically launched under the thrust > of a solid-fuel booster which was then to be dropped; thence, self-propelled > by a liquid-fuel motor, the missile should be guided to a predicted > intercept point in space and detonated by remote control commands; these > commands should be transmitted by radio signals determined by a ground-based > computer associated with radar which would track both the target and the > missile in flight. This was not the only Army missile project at the time; the US Army Air Force was involved in studies of the Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft (GAPA), a slightly longer-range system based on what was essentially a drone aircraft. Bell had been invited to take part in GAPA as well, but declined as they wanted to concentrate on Nike. GAPA was opened to tender, and was picked up by other companies, notably Boeing. This led to a semi-formalized agreement that the Army Air Force and the Ordnance Corps would split development based on whether or not the design \\"depend[ed] for sustenance primarily on the lift of aerodynamic forces\\" like GAPA, or \\"primary on the momentum of the missile\\" like Nike. As part of the Key West Agreement, GAPA was handed to the newly formed US Air Force in 1948, when that force evolved out of the Army Air Force.\\"GAPA (Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft)\\", Boeing Building the team Nike Ajax test firing against a B-17 Flying Fortress. At the ranges and speeds being considered, even a supersonic rocket will take enough time to reach the target that the missile needs to lead the bomber in order to properly intercept it. Bell proposed a system using two radars, one tracking the target, and another tracking the missile. An analog computer would calculate the impact point and send guidance signals to the missile encoded in the second radar's signals, and detonate the warhead on command (as opposed to a proximity fuse). The Ballistics Research Laboratory was asked to calculate the proper warhead shaping to maximize the chance of a hit. Once determined, Picatinny Arsenal would produce the warhead, and Frankford Arsenal would provide a fuse. Douglas Aircraft would provide the missile airframe and carry out aerodynamic studies, while Aerojet would supply a solid fuel rocket booster for initial launch, and Bell Aircraft would provide a liquid fuel rocket for the upper stage sustainer. The initial design used a thin upper stage with eight JATO-derived boosters that were wrapped around its tail. The resulting cluster looked quite boxy at launch time. It was expected that the 93,000 lbf (≈414 kN) of booster power would accelerate the missile to supersonic speeds of 1,750 fps (feet per second, ≈1200 mph, 533 m/s) at the end of a booster phase of 1.8 seconds, increasing almost continually to about 2,500 fps (≈1700 mph, 762 m/s) at the end of the liquid engine's firing, then decreasing to 1,150 fps (≈780 mph, 350 m/s) at 96,000 feet (≈29000 m) during the zooming period. Early in the program, it was realized that existing radar systems based on the conical scanning method did not supply the performance needed for a high-speed missile. In particular, conical scanning radars required some time to settle on an accurate track. The decision was made to use a monopulse radar system for Nike. Two systems were considered, one using phased signals, and another using signal timing known as the \\"amplitude null system\\", with the latter being selected. This study resulted in the development of tunable magnetrons for the 250 kilowatt X-band radars for tracking, and 1000 kilowatt S-band radar for target detection. Experiments demonstrated that the radar return from the missile at high altitudes was limited, and when calls for an extended altitude of 150,000 feet (≈46000 m) were added to the requirements, a transponder was added to the missile to boost the return. These changes, and many more, were summarized in a 28 January 1946 report. The project called for four rounds of test launches starting in 1946, with the aim of having a production design by 1949. Testing The early model Nike had eight JATO bottles in a cluster, demanding large fins for stability. The first test firing of a static round was carried out at the White Sands Proving Ground on 17 September 1946 and then returned to Douglas in California for study. The next week an unguided example was launched, and similar tests followed until 28 January 1947, ending the first test series. During one test a missile reached an altitude of 140,000 feet. A second test series followed in September and October 1947, including several improvements in the design in order to address problems with the booster. A further series in 1948, originally planned for 1946, continued to demonstrate problems. Eventually, the team was forced to give up on the clustered booster concept. Invariably small differences in thrust between the different JATO bottles would lead to significant thrust asymmetries, ones that overwhelmed the stabilizing effect of the fins in spite of them being very large. Instead, the project selected a larger booster being developed by the US Navy's Operation Bumblebee, creating a new version known as the Allegheny JATO T39 2.6DS-51,000. The Navy's similar booster can be seen on the RIM-2 Terrier. A new series of test firings started in September 1948 but were stopped until May 1949 after a number of modifications were carried out. Funding problems then delayed the program until January 1950. From late January through April another 16 missiles were fired, with much better results. Accelerating development Test launch of the production model Nike Ajax missile with the new booster. Through early development, the Nike project had not been considered very important. A series of events in the late 1940s led to a re-appraisal of the situation, including the Soviet atomic test in 1949, the communist victory in China, and the Berlin Blockade. The June 1950 opening of the Korea War brought all of this to a head and new urgency was given to US defense. In October 1950, US Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson appointed Kaufman Keller to the newly created position of Director of Guided Weapons to speed their development. Keller examined the various ongoing projects and decided that Nike was the best developed. He recommended that development of Nike be accelerated and that an initial production run of 60 launch stations and 1,000 missiles should be completed by 31 December 1952, with continued production of 1,000 a month after that date. In January 1951, Wilson approved the plan, in spite of additional testing being required. A new test series of the proposed production model was carried out starting in October, and on 27 November 1951, Nike successfully intercepted a QB-17 target drone. Twenty-two further tests followed that year. In the new year a new test series started, including a live-fire attack on a QB-17 in April 1952 that was viewed by visiting brass. Production The Nike Ajax assembly line. Production was launched in August 1952. By the end of the year, three complete ground systems and 1,000 missiles had been delivered to White Sands. The complete system was set up by January 1953, and an underground launch site first fired on 5 June 1953. Crew training was carried out at Fort Bliss with the missiles fired toward White Sands. Service deliveries began that year, and eventually, a total of 350 launch systems and 13,714 missiles were produced over the production run. In 1957, the National Guard started taking over the anti-aircraft role, replacing regular army units at Bliss. Deployment This Nike Ajax site is on full alert, with missiles ready for launch on all sixteen launch sites. This image appears to be taken from the control area (IFC) which was separated from the launch area to allow its radars to see the missiles as they launched. Nike bases were arranged around major cities and military sites. Deployment of the Nike I was under the direction of the Army Anti-Aircraft Command (ARAACOM). ARAACOM initially proposed a series of widespread bases surrounding cities and major military sites. However, while planning the deployment around Chicago, it became clear that Lake Michigan would force sites protecting approach from the east to be located in the city itself. Moreover, various scenarios demonstrated that having a staggered two- layer layout of the sites would offer much greater protection, which argued for some bases to be located closer to the urban centers. For range safety reasons, launch sites had to have considerable empty land around them in the event of an accidental warhead or fuel explosion. Originally this would require about 119 acres of land per site. This presented a serious problem for the planners, and especially the Corps of Engineers Real Estate Offices. As early as 1952 they had asked for a solution, which led to design architect Leon Chatelain, Jr. developing an underground configuration. As the missile batteries were now protected and accidental explosions would be contained, the safe area was dramatically reduced, and that cut the land requirement down to 40 acres. This was the system tested at White Sands in 1953 and with its success, on 28 October 1953 ARAACOM directed that most deployments would use this option. The system used a basic building block with four above-ground launching stations over an underground battery with additional missiles. Missiles were raised to the surface on an elevator and then pushed, by hand, along rails to their launchers. Stations normally consisted of four to six of these basic building blocks. The first site to build their Nike I system was Fort Meade, who started receiving their missiles in December 1953, replacing their 120 mm M1 guns.Merle Cole, \\"Nike Missiles: Army Air Defense Installations In Anne Arundel County: 1950–1973\\" , Fort George G. Meade Museum This site reached initial operational status in March 1954, and went on full round-the-clock combat status on 30 May. The Army considers 30 May to be the \\"birth date\\" of the Nike system. On 15 November 1956 the missile was officially renamed as the Nike Ajax, as part of DA Circular 700-22. Over the next four years, 265 batteries were constructed around the majority of major northern and coastal cities. They replaced 896 radar-guided anti-aircraft guns, leaving only a handful of 75 mm Skysweeper emplacements as the only anti-aircraft artillery remaining in use by the US. All of the Skysweepers were removed from service by 1960.Stephen Moeller, \\"Vigilant and Invincible\\", ADA Magazine, May/June 1995, Chapter 3, Modernization A Nike Ajax missile exploded accidentally at a battery in Leonardo, New Jersey on 22 May 1958, killing 6 soldiers and 4 civilians. A memorial can be found at Fort Hancock in the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area.\\"Nike Ajax Explosion – Sandy Hook, NJ\\" After Ajax The Nike missile family, with the Zeus B in front of the Hercules and Ajax. Nike site D-57/58 was used for both Ajax and Hercules until 1974, and is now in an advanced state of decay. As early as April 1952, planners expressed concerns over the Ajax's ability to pick out targets in a packed formation. The Nike radar would see several nearby targets as a single larger one, unable to resolve the individual aircraft. The warhead's lethal range was smaller than the resolution, so it might not approach any one of the aircraft close enough to damage it. This led to suggestions about equipping the Nike with a nuclear warhead, which would be able to attack the entire formation with a single round. Bell was asked to study this in May, and they considered two options; one using the WX-9 warhead on the existing missile, which they called \\"Nike Ajax\\", while a slightly enlarged missile with the XW-7 warhead was known as \\"Nike Hercules\\". The Army selected the Hercules option, ordering it into development in December 1952. At the time, the missiles were officially known as Nike I and Nike B. As part of DA Circular 700-22, Nike I officially became Nike Ajax and Nike B became Nike Hercules. The nuclear-armed Nike B was originally going to be a slightly larger Nike I, just wide enough to carry the new warhead. But during early development, the decision was made to move to a solid fuel upper stage. This required a larger fuselage and was heavier as well. In order to get the new missile into the air, the booster engine was replaced with a new design using four of the original boosters strapped together. The new missile offered interception altitudes well above and ranges on the order of . A new long- range search radar was introduced, the HIPAR, but the original AQU radar was retained as well, now known as LOPAR.Although none of the references state the reason for keeping the AQU radar, it appears this was in order to avoid having to upgrade certain displays in the control centers. The tracking radars were also upgraded to higher power. But with those exceptions, Hercules was operationally similar to Ajax, and designed to operate at existing Ajax sites, using their launchers and underground facilities. Conversion from Ajax to Hercules began in June 1958. Initially, the Hercules was deployed at new bases, providing coverage over existing Ajax areas. But plans had been made to convert existing Ajax sites to Hercules where possible, or close the Ajax base where it was not. As the Hercules had over double the range of the Ajax, fewer sites were needed to provide the same coverage. A total of 134 Hercules bases were commissioned, down from Ajax's 240. The last US Ajax site, outside Norfolk, Virginia, closed in November 1963. Ajax remained in active service in overseas locations for some time. The Japan Self-Defense Forces operated theirs until they were replaced by the Hercules-based Nike J in the 1970s. As the original Bell Nike team worked on Hercules, the nature of the strategic threat was changing. By the late 1950s the concern was the ICBM and little interest in the threat of bombers remained. Even before Hercules deployed, Bell was once again asked to consider the new threat. They concluded that the Nike B (Hercules) could be adapted into an anti-ballistic missile with relatively few changes to the missile. The role would require considerably greater upgrades to the radars and computers instead. These efforts gave rise to the Nike II project in 1958, soon known as LIM-49 Nike Zeus. Unlike the earlier Nike efforts, the Zeus would never reach operational status. Like the Ajax and Hercules, Zeus could only attack a single target at a time, although by deploying multiple radars it was expected that up to six missiles could be guided at once. This was fine when the threat was a few dozen enemy ICBMs, but as it became clear that the Soviets were placing almost all of their effort into ICBMs, Zeus looked increasingly unable to deal with the hundreds of targets that would result. Serious technical problems also arose, including electromagnetic pulse and similar effects that blocked radar, questions about the missile's ability to damage enemy warheads, and above all, rapidly rising costs. Development was canceled in January 1963.Donald Baucom, \\"The Origins of SDI, 1944–1983\\", University Press of Kansas, 1992, p. 19. Nike boosters A Nike Ajax missile at the Belgian Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels. As Ajax missiles were removed from service, thousands of unused booster rockets were left over from the program, and more when the Hercules was removed from service years later. These proved perfect for all sorts of roles, notably as the boosters for various sounding rockets. These designs often, but not always, included \\"Nike\\" in their name. Examples include the Nike-Cajun, Nike-Apache, Nike-Smoke and many others. Description The TTR and MTR radars used a fresnel lens made of thin metal plates arranged in a frame. The feed horn is at the bottom of the A-shaped supports. The ACQ radar was the primary search radar for the Ajax, and was also used for short-range duties with the Hercules as LOPAR. This Nike Ajax site has only two launch areas, the oval-shaped areas in the middle of the image. The rectangular openings are elevators that raise the missiles from their underground storage areas, and the four launchers are the small squares on either side. To the left of the launchers is the refueling area, surrounded by a high berm in case one of the missiles exploded. A complete Nike Ajax system consisted of several radars, computers, missiles, and their launchers. Sites were generally arranged in three major sections, the administration area, area A, the magazine and launcher area with the missiles, L, and the Integrated Fire Control area with the radar and operations center, or IFC. Most sites placed the A and IFC on one parcel of land with the L on another, but some sites used three entirely separate areas. The IFC was located between 1,000 yards and a mile from the launchers, but had to be within the line-of- site so the radars could see the missiles as they launched. The launch area normally consisted of two or three underground facilities and their aboveground launchers. Sites with four to six launchers were not unknown. A single launcher site normally held twelve missiles, eight in the service area and four in the underground ready area or on their launchers. When an alert was received, the missiles were transferred to the surface one at a time using an elevator, then pushed along rails on the surface leading to the launchers. The launchers bisected the rails, so the missiles were simply pushed over the launchers, connected to the electrical hookups, and then raised to about 85 degrees by the launchers. The missile launch area also contained a separate fueling area surrounded by a large berm, a required safety precaution given the hypergolic fuels, and a variety of service areas. Long distance surveillance was handled by the ACQ or LOPAR radar, short for \\"Low-Power Acquisition Radar.\\" LOPAR included an IFF system and a system for handing off targets to the tracking radars. Two monopulse tracking radars were used, the Target Tracking Radar (TTR) to track the target handed off by the LOPAR, and the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) to track the missile as it flew toward the target. Launch of the missile was accomplished by lighting the solid fuel booster, which provided 59,000 lbf of thrust for three seconds. The booster pushed the missile through the sound barrier, and it remained supersonic for the rest of its flight. The MTR picked up the missile as the booster fell away, and then tracked it continually after that point. Data from the TTR and MTR were sent to the analog tracking computer, which continually calculated the impact point and sent radio commands to the missile to guide it. In order to maximize range, the missile was normally flown almost vertically to a higher altitude than the target, where the thinner air lowered drag and allowed the missile to descend on its target. At the correct time, the missile's three warheads were triggered by a signal from the computer. The warheads were surrounded by metal cubes providing a blast-fragmentation effect. The Nike Ajax system could attack only one target at a time, a problem it shared with its descendants. As the various Ajax missile sites were overlapped, this led to the possibility that two sites might attack one target while another flew past both. ARADCOM initially set up a coordination system not unlike the Royal Air Force's plotting room from the Battle of Britain, with commands from a central manual plotting room being sent to batteries over telephone lines. This was clearly inadequate, and in the late 1950s the Interim Battery Data Link was introduced to share data between batteries. This allowed command to be devolved to the battery commanders, who could see which targets other batteries were attacking. This system was further improved with the introduction of the Missile Master system, which replaced manual plotting with a computer-run system, and then the simpler and smaller Missile Mentor and BIRDIE systems.Considerable detail on the battlefield control systems are available in \\"Air Defense Artillery Control Systems\\", US Army Air Defense Digest, 1966, pp. 34–41. The Nike batteries were organized in Defense Areas and placed around population centers and strategic locations such as long- range bomber and important military/naval bases, nuclear production facilities and (later) ICBM sites. The Nike sites in a Defense Area formed a circle around these cities and bases. There was no fixed number of Nike batteries in a Defense Area and the actual number of batteries varied from a low of 2 in the Barksdale AFB Defense Area to a high of 22 in the Chicago Defense Area. In the US the sites were numbered from 01 to 99 starting at the north and increasing clockwise. The numbers had no relation to actual compass headings, but generally Nike sites numbered 01 to 25 were to the northeast and east, those numbered 26 to 50 were to the southeast and south, those numbered 51 to 75 were to the southwest and west, and those numbered 76 to 99 were to the northwest and north. The Defense Areas were identified by a one- or two-letter code which were related to the city name. Thus those Nike sites starting with C were in the Chicago Defense Area, those starting with HM were in the Homestead AFB/Miami Defense Area, those starting with NY were in the New York Defense Area, and so forth. As an example Nike Site SF-88L refers to the launcher area (L) of the battery located in the northwestern part (88) of the San Francisco Defense Area (SF). Studies throughout the Nike project considered mobile launchers, but none were developed for the Ajax system. Missile sites were \\"relocatable\\" or \\"transportable\\", and all of the support equipment was built into trailers or otherwise provided road wheels.Ed Thelen, \\"Nike was 'mobile'?\\", Ed Thelen's Nike Missile Web Site.

History The gardens are laid out around a large house and estate. It was originally built in 1695, then rebuilt in 1878 and then extended 1913 all for the Dawes family. The house is listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England, and its gardens are also Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The gardens were laid out in the early 1900s, but after wartime neglect (when most adult men were enlisted in wartime services) were substantially restored by Mary and Bill Dawes from the early 1950s. Mary Dawes was involved in the day-to-day running of the gardens until her death in 2009, at the age of 93. Mount Ephraim has never been a 'professionally' maintained garden, but Mary had always lovingly tended it. Description Mount Ephraim Gardens have a large collection of spring bulbs, trees and shrubs including Rhododendrons, many types of Camellias and Magnolias. It has various areas, including the Millennium Rose Garden. It also has a large Sweet Chestnut, planted to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo. The 'Miz-maze' was planted in 2004 on the slopes of a former vineyard. Based on an ancient labyrinth called a Mizmaze (Mary Dawes, who lived at Mount Ephraim for sixty years, was always known to family and friends as 'Miz'). It was created by garden designer Sarah Morgan. Although based on a traditional labyrinth design, the layout incorporates some dead-ends, making it a hybrid between a maze and a labyrinth. The pattern of the grass paths is marked out with combinations of tall-growing ornamental grasses and colourful herbaceous perennial plants. The rock garden together with the water garden, is based on a series of pools ornamented with a Japanese stone bridge and stone lanterns. The topiary of the garden has been cut into a various birds and animals, and also First World War memorabilia in clipped yew. The long herbaceous border, has a brick wall giving wind shelter and it provides colour throughout the flowering season. The arboretum was planted to commemorate the late Mary Dawes' 80th birthday and also the 300 years of the family's ownership of Mount Ephraim. Sited on an artificially raised mound, the area gives far views of Blean woods, Hernhill church and the Miz Maze. The gardens also include a Ha-ha, which was built in the 18th Century of red brick.

Before the dance begins, the male Cherokee performers, known as \\"Boogers\\", discreetly leave the party. Booger masks, are colorful masks that represented evil spirits. Booger masks were made from wood or hornets nests and were originally made as part of the Booger Dance, a winter celebration that ensured evil spirits could not disrupt the coming growing season. The Boogers also represent the malevolent spirits of those who oppose the Cherokee. They act in a stereotypically lewd manner by chasing the females around, grabbing them if possible, to satirize and ridicule what is seen as the non-Cherokee's predatory lust for the Cherokee. The dance and accompanying music are traditionally believed to drive away or offer protection against the inimical spirits, and those in whom they dwell, striking fear into their hearts, while providing comedic relief for the tribal members. Eventually, these masks came to resemble the faces of the White trespassers. The masks could be fashioned from gourds, animal skins, or buckeye wood.

Then these cells are transplanted to a patient with the disease. There are different kinds of treatments that focus on reducing the symptoms of the disease but currently there is no cure. Current treatments Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition that is the result of the death of the cell that contains and produces dopamine in substantia nigra. People with PD may develop disturbance in their motor activities. Some activities can be tremor or shaking, rigidity and slow movements (bradykinesia). Patients may eventually present certain psychiatric problems like depression and dementia. Current pharmacological intervention consist on the administration of L-dopa, a dopamine precursor. The L-dopa therapy increases dopamine production of the remaining nigral neurons. Other therapy is the deep brain electrical stimulation to modulate the overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus to the loss of dopamine signaling in the stratum. However, with this treatment, the number of substantia nigra neurons decrease so it becomes less efficient. These treatments try to reduce the symptoms of the patient focusing on increasing the production of dopamine but they do not cure the disease. The new treatments for PD are in clinical trials and most of them are centered on gene therapy. With this, researchers expect to compensate the loss of dopamine or to protect the dopamine neurons from degeneration. The pharmacological and surgical therapies for PD focus on compensating the ganglia dysfunction caused by the degeneration of the dopaminergic neuron from substantia nigra. Gene therapy background There are many new PD treatments in clinical trials and several of those are focusing on gene therapeutic approaches that compensate the loss of dopamine or protect the nervous system dopamine neurons from degeneration. There are some important reasons for focusing on gene therapy as a treatment for PD. First of all, currently there is no cure for this disease. Secondly, some genes have been identified which can modulate the neuron phenotype or act as neuroprotective agents. Also, the environment of the brain cannot afford repeated injections into the region where the substantia nigra meets the striatum, the nigrostriatum. Therefore, gene therapy could be a single treatment appealing, viral vectors used in the therapy are diffusible and capable to do transduction of the striatum. Gene therapy bases  The main idea of the gene therapy is to create new generations of cells that produce particular neurotransmitter (dopamine) and then transplant these cells to the patients with PD. This is because the neurons cannot proliferate nor be renewed; and replacing lost neurons it is a process that is currently going under investigation. Also, the use of embryonic dopaminergic cells cannot be used because these cells are difficult to obtain and modifications of cell can only be made on somatic cells, not germline. With the modifications of the transplanted cell, there can be a change in the expression of the genes or normalize them. Types of gene therapy There are several types of gene therapy. There are therapies for symptomatic approaches like the production of ectopic L-dopa, the full ectopic dopamine synthesis, the ectopic L-dopa conversion or the use of glutamic acid descarboxylase (GAD). Also there are disease modifying therapies like NTN or GNDF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), the regulation of the α-synuclein and Parkin gene expression. Currently the main studies are using AAV2 as a vector platform, making it the standard vector for this disease although a lentevirus has also been used. In the different types of the gene therapy, the investigations are encoding enzymes that are necessary for dopamine synthesis, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, GTP cyclohydrolase 1 and AADC. Symptomatic approaches A symptomatic approach is a treatment focused on the symptoms of the patients. The first one, consists in the ectopic dopamine synthesis. Here, the production of ectopic L-dopa in the striatum is another alternative gene therapy. This therapy consists on transferring the TH and GTP cyclohydrolase 1 genes into the MSNs because the endogenous AADC activity is able to convert the L-dopa into dopamine. In an experiment in 2005, using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and GCH1 altogether with vectors, they could provide normal levels of L-dopa to rats. The results of this experiment showed reduced dyskinesias by 85% as well as, the reversion view of abnormal projections in the striatum using the TH-GCH1 gene transfer. Dopamine synthesis can be fully ectopic. In this case, the enzyme AADC it is in charge of converting the levodopa to dopamine. In Parkinson disease, the loss of neurons from the nigrostriatum leads to the inability to convert levodopa to dopamine. The goal of AAV2-hAADC is to restore normal levels of AADC in the striatum so there could be more conversion of levodopa, and therefore reducing levodopa- induced dyskinesia. Using the gene therapy, in 2012, an experiment was accomplish with primates testing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) transgene in primate astrocytes. Gene therapy was made with the transfer of a TH full-length cDNA using rat TH. The results showed behavioural improvement in the monkeys that received the plasmid, unlike the control monkey. Another type is the ectopic L-dopa conversion in which they use a gene enzyme replacement therapy that can be used to increase the efficacy of the pharmacological L-dopa therapy by using AAV vectors. This AAV vectors have been designed to send the AADC coding sequence to the MSN (medium spiny neurons) in the striatum to be able to convert administered L-dopa into dopamine. Other kind of gene therapy as a symptomatic approach is the use of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression in the subthalamic nucleus. This is a gene enzyme replacement therapy that can be used to increase the efficacy of the pharmacological L-dopa therapy by using AAV vectors. This AAV vectors have been designed to send the AADC coding sequence to the MSN in the striatum to be able to convert administered L-dopa into dopamine. A phase 2 study, published in the journal Lancet Neurology Parkinson, says that a gene therapy called NLX-P101 dramatically reduces movement damage. In this study, they used glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). They introduced genetic material in the brain related to motor functions. The symptoms included tremor, stiffness and difficulty in movements; and were improved in half of the group in gene therapy, while in the control group, 14% improved them. Disease modifying There are therapies in development based in the modification of the disease. The first one is the neurotrophic factors gene delivery. In this therapy, GNDF or NTN are used to protect the system. GNDF is a factor of the TGFß superfamily, is secreted by astrocytes (glia cells that are in charge of the survival of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons) and is homologous to NTN, persephin and artemin. Preclinical studies of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic in relation to Parkinson disease system have shown that GNDF and NTN are very potential neuroprotective agents. Another type in the disease’s modification technique is the synuclein silencing. Some cases of PD were related to polymorphisms in the α-synuclein promoter and also in the multiplication of the locus that carries the α-synuclein gene. Therefore, trying to down-regulate the α-synuclein expression could impact the development of the disease. There have been explored several viral vector-based gene delivery system that interfere with α- synuclein expression, and they depend on the interference of the RNA (destabilizing the α-synuclein RNAm) and/or the block the protein translation (using short hairpin RNA or micro RNA directed against the α-synuclein RNAm sequence). The discovery of the Parkin gene is another type of modification of PD. The Parkin gene is linked with mutations associated with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (previous state of Parkinson with the typical symptoms and pathology but with a slow progression). The mutations in the Parkin gene are responsible for the development of the autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. New projects and investigations  More gene therapy trials have been conducted for PD (with the adeno-associated virus 2 gene), the objectives and strategies used on the actual researches are clear, the research tries to translate the experience obtained during the trials and try to improve the development of new technology for the gene therapy of PD.

In 1969, he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan, where he has remained ever since.  Change to Astrophysics  Akerlof initially studied the strong and electromagnetic interactions of elementary particles in a number of experiments at the Cornell electron synchrotron, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab and the Stanford Linear Accelerator. His interests began to shift to astrophysics in 1980 with the exploration of how high energy particle physics techniques could be applied to astrophysics. The first effort along these lines showed that despite the wishful thinking of a number of physicists, magnetic monopoles could not be detected by the acoustic waves that would be generated in electrical conductors.Akerlof, C.W. (1982). \\"Limits on the Thermoacoustic Detectability of Electric and Magnetic Charges\\", Phys. Rev. D26, 1116-1127. http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v26/i5/p1116_1 In 1986, he started to look for TeV gamma-ray radiation of cosmic origin using a pair of solar concentrators at Sandia National Laboratory as light collectors.Punch, M. and Akerlof, C.W. et al. (1992). \\"Detection of TeV photons from the active galaxy Markarian 421\\", Nature Vol. 358, 477-478 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6386/abs/358477a0.html This work morphed into collaboration with a group at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona directed by Trevor Weekes that led to the unexpected discovery of such radiation from Active Galactic Nuclei at cosmological distances. A few years later, fascinated by the mystery of bright cosmic explosions called gamma-ray bursts, he began a series of experiments in 1992 to find prompt optical traces of these violent events, culminating in a successful optical observation on January 23, 1999.Steeh, J.

The trip produced little science but provided significant insights regarding the organizational difficulties faced by Russian physicists in the waning decade of the Soviet system.Akerlof, C.W.

His most significant contribution in this area is the ROTSE Collaboration which has built and operated four robotic optical telescopes on four continents in Australia, the United States, Namibia and Turkey. This project has been running for about a decade and has successfully observed and detected gamma- ray bursts and supernovae. A former University of Michigan student, Wiphu Rujopakorn, has taken advantage of the ROTSE imaging data for instructing school children in Thailand about the mysteries of astronomy.  Significant Discoveries  Akerlof is best known for his work in establish the feasibility of real time searches for optical transients and the subsequent observations of a large number of gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. He was also a participant in the discovery of TeV gamma-rays from the type of Active Galactic Nuclei known as “blazars”. NASA considered his discovery of optical radiation from GRB990123 one of the top ten discoveries of that year.Keegan, S.

More recent archaeological work and research by Alissa Slade casts doubt on Jones's theory and indicates the site was not San Miguel de Asile, a Timucuan mission, but rather an Apalachee mission, possibly San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco.Slade, Alissa Marie (2006).

Anhaica was rediscovered in 1988 by Jones on the grounds of the Gov. John W. Martin House in Tallahassee. Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park was rediscovered in 1987 by B. Calvin Jones. It is located within DeSoto Site Historic State Park). After the abandonment of the Lake Jackson site, the chiefdom seat was moved to Anhaica, where in 1539 it was visited by the Hernando de Soto entrada, who knew the residents as the historic Muskogean-speaking Apalachee people. The mounds location on private property outside the state owned park meant it was not protected as the mounds inside the park are and it was leveled for use as fill dirt in the winter of 1975–1976. Before it was dug away by Jones, an archaeologist with the State of Florida Bureau of Historic Sites and Properties, conducted a salvage operation. He recovered 24 burials from Mound 3, with others known to have been lost in the destruction of the mound. Seven of the twelve levels that had been the top of the mound had graves dug into them. Graves dug into the other levels may have been lost as the mound was destroyed. The burials were in deep pits, some lined with split logs, but each grave was kept track of as none were dug down into previous graves. Before burial the bodies were wrapped in cloth and an embossed copper plate placed on their chest. They were then wrapped in leather and cane matting and placed into the prepared pit graves and split logs placed over them. This entire procedure of wrapping the body is reminiscent of \\"bundling\\", a practice used for sacred objects which has a long history among Native North Americans. A selection of other grave goods have been found wrapped in the bundles. In the sequence from lower to higher levels (oldest to more recent), the grave goods became more elaborate. In the upper levels, the grave goods included many objects made of copper, beads made of shell and pearl, and pipes associated with ritual use of tobacco. Although most of the burials were of elite men, the graves included one woman (buried with the most elaborate falcon dancer copper plate) and a child of about eleven years of age, probably of the elite class. One of the bodies had been cremated. The bones of a dog were found on top of one of the clay levels that was an earlier top surface of the mound.

The exam includes a breast examination, a pelvic examination and a pap smear but may also include other procedures. Hospitals employ strict policies relating to the provision of consent by the patient, the availability of chaperones at the examination, and the absence of other parties. Importance Although women often undergo well-woman examinations on an annual basis, the interval for this visit and exam will vary depending on the needs of the patient. The purpose of this exam in asymptomatic women is to screen for potential abnormalities, such as sexually transmitted diseases, and malignancy. Breast examination Visual inspection The breast examination begins with a visual inspection. With the patient in a supine or seated position, the medical professional will look at both breasts to check the color, symmetry, dimensions according to age, lean body mass, the physiological (pregnancy and lactation) and race, looking for abnormalities, such as bulges and shrinkage. One of these abnormalities is changed in the areola or nipple. If it is flattened or retracted (umbilicated), it is necessary to consider the possibility of a cancerous lesion which has caused the malformation. Palpation Next, the breasts are palpated, again with the patient lying or sitting. The patient has to lift the arm and put one hand behind her head. With this position, the entire gland is palpated. It is also important to examine the armpits, because of masses that may be found there. The test is executed pressing the gland with two or three fingers against the chest wall, making a radial route or by quadrants. The nipples are also squeezed to check for secretions, such as secretion of milk (galactorrhea), serous, blood or purulent secretions. If a node is detected, it is necessary to determine its place, size, shape, edges, consistency and sensitivity. Self-examination Breast self-examination is not recommended as this practice is associated with increased false positive findings and no evidence of benefit. Instead breast self-awareness is encouraged. Breast self-awareness includes being familiar with the normal contour of one's breast but does not involve monthly self-examinations. Further examination of the breasts A mammogram or mammography is a special x-ray of the breasts. They are the procedure most likely to detect early breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Mammograms can show tumors long before they are large enough to palpate. They are recommended for women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who are at increased risk of developing the disease. They are performed with the patient standing, the breast pressed between two plastic plates, as the image is taken. The interpretation has to be performed by a specialist. Breast ultrasound is a complementary study of mammography. In many women the tissue that makes up the breast is very dense, representing fibrous tissue and glandular tissue, which produces milk during lactation. This limits the radiologist interpreting the study, so, in these cases, the ultrasound is helpful, since this is capable of distinguishing tumors in women with dense breast tissue, where identification is otherwise difficult. Additionally, it is advisable to follow up a mammogram that shows indications of tumors with an ultrasound, to confirm, before more invasive procedures are undertaken. Pelvic exam The pelvic exam is part of the physical examination of the internal pelvic organs (uterus, cervix, ovaries), vagina, and external genitalia. This exam often includes three parts: # Inspection of the external genitalia # Bimanual examination # Inspection of the cervix and vagina using a speculum. Inspection of external female genitalia  The patient is placed in a supine position on a special examination table, which has two protrusions called \\"stirrups.\\" With the feet in these stirrups, the legs are placed in a position such that the medical professional can access the pelvic area. The external genitalia is examined first, looking for abnormalities like lesions, ulcers, warts and color changes. The elements of this exam include the vulva, which contains the mons pubis, of which there are two longitudinal folds of skin forming the labia majora; then the labia minora and hair follicles. The clitoral hood is also checked. Bimanual exam The purpose of this exam is to palpate or feel the pelvic organs. The index and middle finger are inserted into the vagina. This maneuver allows the doctor to palpate the vagina for any deep lacerations, masses, or nodularity. Next, the cervix is palpated to check position, size, consistency, and mobility. The other hand is placed on the abdomen, compressing the uterus between both hands. This maneuver allows the clinician to assess the size, shape, consistency, tilt, and mobility of the uterus. With this technique, the ovaries may also be palpable. This examination is useful for identifying clinical signs of medical conditions, such as infection, presence of a mass, or structural abnormality. Speculum examination The speculum is an instrument made of metal or plastic and is constructed with two flaps. Its purpose is to separate and widen the vaginal opening and keep it open. This allows direct observation by the physician into the vaginal canal with the help of a lamp or a mirror. There are different types of speculums used within the different characteristics of each patient such as age, sex life, and other factors. The first step is to open the vaginal opening with two fingers at the vulvo-perineal angle, then separate the fingers slightly and press down, then insert the speculum arranging the width of the tip of the flaps in anteroposterior. Then the speculum is moved into the vagina at an angle of 45°, following the natural contour of the posterior vaginal wall. When the speculum is in place, the fingers are removed and the device is rotated so that the flaps are horizontal. The flaps are then separated and locked into place when the cervical neck is completely visible. The speculum examination is not necessary for adolescents who are asymptomatic. Screening tests  Samples for screening tests may be collected during the pelvic exam. These screening tests include: # Cervical Cancer Screening - A pap smear and/or HPV testing may be performed as a screening test for cervical cancer. The procedure begins by gently scraping or sampling the cells of the cervix using a special spatula, brush or swab. Some women experience temporary bleeding from this procedure. The scrapings are placed on a slide, covered with a fixative for later examination under a microscope to determine if they are normal or abnormal. Depending on patient's age or pap smear result, HPV testing may also be performed. # Sexually Transmitted Infection Screening - Depending on age and risk factors, clinicans may recommend gonorrhea or chlamydia testing at the time of the well woman exam. This sample can be collected via a swab of the cervix or vagina. This swab can be collected by the clinician or the patient. Urine samples can also be used for this test. Additional screening tests include blood tests for hepatitis C, HIV, and syphilis.

For Boston Air Defense Sector operations (e.g., for radar tracks supporting the 26th ADMS BOMARC surface-to-air missile site at ), the USAF also used an Air Defense Command operations shelter () for controlling the FPS-6Bs to process height requests from the sector's \\"Air Defense Control and Coordination System\\" (DC-02). Activated at the fort in 1959 was the headquarters for the 820th Radar Squadron which, instead of being designated a \\"SAGE\\" radar squadron as with other units, was renamed an AC&W; Sq in 1961. The 820th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron inactivated in 1962 after the operation—instead of using a \\"P\\" (Permanent) or \\"Z\\" (SAGE) designation as with other NORAD/ADC sites—had used the \\"MM-1\\" designation for the ADDC planned for collocation with the Army's 3rd operational Missile Master. Planned Air Defense Direction Center The Ft Heath \\"Joint Manual Direction Center\\" was planned by January 24, 1957, and the site plan was approved on October 31, 1957. NORAD/CONAD used the \\"MM-1\\" designation for the JMDC in the June 1958 historical summary. The summary estimated the AADCP and USAF ADDC would be operational in August 1960 with \\"Air Force operating consoles\\" in the Army bunker after the estimated March 1960 installation of the ARSR-1. An AN/GPA-37 Course Directing Group installation was to be completed by April 1960 to allow manual USAF ADDC ground-controlled intercept operations until SAGE DC-02 was operational for the Boston Air Defense Sector (forecast August 1960). The modification to the ARSR-1A configuration (Amplitron, \\"antenna gear box modification\\", etc.) was to be complete by November 1960. Radar station construction had begun by September 22, 1959, and by the end of 1959, Ft Heath was designated to be a Category 1a NORAD Control Center with the AN/GPA-37 to have the data processing computer for the SAGE TDDL to/from equipped interceptors. However, since Ft Heath ADDC operation would have only been used for a few months until SAGE DC-02 had ground-controlled interception capability, the AN/GPA-37 installation was never completed. For the SAGE/Missile Master test program, NORAD requested an abbreviated AN/FSG-1 \\"be made available…in the Boston area by 1 Ju.l.y 1959\\" and during Ft Heath bunker construction, 5 of 7 Glenn L. Martin pallets of FSG-1 equipment were assembled at the nearby Fort Banks for testing with the Experimental SAGE Subsector (XD-1 prototype AN/FSQ-7 at Lexington, Massachusetts) for the Second Phase NORAD SAGE/Missile Master test (September 1959) to assess the Automatic Targeting and Battery Evaluation algorithm. Missile Master nuclear bunker The Fort Heath Direction Center (B-21DC) was the Army Air Defense Command Post for the Boston Defense Area housed in the partially underground nuclear bunker and manned by the Air Defense Brigade headquartered at Fort Banks. To network the local \\"Missile Master organic radars\\" and several remote Nike batteries' radars, the Direction Center (DC) became operational 1960 at the site formerly used by the MIT research building. The DC included a Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense System with consoles and overhead displays of the tactical display and tracking subsystems within an Antiaircraft Operations Center (\\"Blue Room\\") recessed in a pit with a stage. Instead of an underground decontamination water supply beneath the AAOC as with the nominal bunker plan, the Army Corps of Engineers (New England District) had exterior emergency water tanks built in addition to a 210,000 gallon freshwater tank. The typical FSG-1 crew was 22 soldiers and 5 company grade officers, and the bunker had an office (page 55) for the Army Air Defense Commander. In 1962 the Boston Defense Area merged with the Hartford and Providence areas to become the New England Defense Area, and in early 1965 the vacuum tube AN/FSG-1 was replaced with a solid-state Martin AN/GSG-5 BIRDIE (than a Hughes AN/TSQ-51 by July 1968). The \\"control site\\" was demolished in 1969 (the bunker remained in 1971),Image and after a Rhode Island AN/TSQ-51 had opened by July 1, 1970, Project Concise closed the remaining Nike batteries in 1974. The site of the former radar station now includes a small park and a complex of large apartment buildings.

The well was on the land of Jackson Barnett, a Creek landowner who subsequently became known as the \\"world's richest Indian\\". Anna and Jackson Barnett in 1923 Barnett owned in trust Creek County, which began producing oil in 1912. Jackson's 12.5 percent royalty on the oil from his land earned him between $3 million and $4 million during his lifetime, but he only received a few hundred dollars per year at first. Until 1920, his fortune was managed as a trust by Creek County courts and the Department of the Interior, on the pretext that Jackson was illiterate and legally incompetent due to a head injury. Barnett's money became the subject of extensive litigation and eventual Congressional hearings. In 1920, he was pursued by Anna Laura Lowe, whom he married after one meeting.

It follows the story of Hilly Kristal's New York club from its concept as a venue for Country, Bluegrass and Blues (CBGB) to what it ultimately became: the birthplace of underground rock 'n' roll and punk.Internet Movie Database The film uses devices such as a comic book-style panels, as well as onscreen text to identify important figures in the punk movement. Plot In 1970s New York City, Hilly Kristal is divorced and has filed bankruptcy for the second time. Despite setbacks, he is determined to own and manage a bar. With his business partner Merv Ferguson, Kristal convinces his mother to lend them the money needed to establish the dive bar CBGB, which Kristal intends to make into a country music venue. The business gets off to a rocky start as there are few customers and Kristal has difficulty finding country acts. However, a rock band called Television arrives at the bar and auditions. Seeing potential, Kristal books them. CBGB soon becomes a rock venue that caters to the burgeoning punk movement. New acts such as Blondie, Patti Smith, Talking Heads, and The Ramones begin to get noticed by playing at the club. The fledgling fanzine Punk also gets its start by reporting on the bands and debating the movement's ideology (or lack thereof). Despite CBGB's newfound success, Kristal poorly manages the club's funds (he keeps the money in his apartment freezer) and fails to regularly pay bills or rent. Kristal's daughter Lisa tries to take over the chaotic finances in an attempt to save the business. After The Ramones are signed to Sire Records, Kristal decides to manage CBGB regulars The Dead Boys. Lisa warns Kristal that he can't financially afford to take on a band. Kristal ignores her, as well as others who caution him about The Dead Boys' destructive and anti-social behavior. While on tour, the band crashes and totals their truck and equipment, leaving Kristal and CBGB broke. This leads to Ferguson threatening to leave the business for good, which Kristal doesn't believe. Soon afterwards, The Dead Boys gets into a fight with a group of thugs and their drummer, Johnny Blitz, is stabbed seventeen times and barely survives. Despondent and penniless, Kristal announces to his employees that CBGB will be closing. Ferguson and Lisa reveal that they have made many calls to grateful friends whom Kristal helped in the past. They've scraped together enough money to stay open long enough to stabilize the situation. The film ends with The Police auditioning for Kristal. The epilogue reveals that CBGB remained open until 2006. Kristal remains an important figure in the history of punk and rock and roll. Lisa went on to become a lawyer. Ferguson always wore a yellow construction helmet and no one ever knew why. Kristal continued to manage The Dead Boys until they broke up in 1979. The epilogue closes by stating Kristal's dog, Jonathan, had legendary bowels since he was known for defecating wherever he pleased inside the club. Over the final credits, the real-life Talking Heads' acceptance speech during the 2002 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony is played, during which they invite Kristal to the stage and thank him for his support.

Ho! No no!\\". At Metacritic, the film has received an average score of 30 out of 100, based on 17 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"merely a mess of caricatures\\".Los Angeles Times Likewise, Brian McManus of The Village Voice writes: \\"CBGB's biggest problem is that it's taken such electrifying source material and done absolutely zilch with it.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack was released on October 8, 2013. It is available on CD, Vinyl and as a digital download. The first pressing Omnivore released of the soundtrack is a double album on translucent pink vinyl. Rhino released a deluxe digital version with additional tracks on the same day.

Alice Barnham (née Bradbridge) (1523–1604) is chiefly remembered for commissioning a family portrait in 1557 which is one of the earliest family portraits of English origins. Biography Alice, born in Chichester, Sussex on 7 September 1523. She was one of the youngest of the fourteen children of William Bradbridge (d. 1546), a successful and prosperous mercer, and his wife, Alice. Alice married Francis Barnham (1515/16–1576), a draper and a London alderman most likely in the years 1546 or 1547. Francis Barnham owned a house on St Clement's Lane, Eastcheap that been the London residence of the Abbot of Stratford Langthorne. Under the rules of the time Francis as a draper merchant was prohibited from keeping a shop. To circumvent this rule Alice ran the retail branch of the family business and was considered to be a professional silkwoman. The couple were successful financially (by 1576 the year that Francis died their income was around £1000 per annum) and rose in society. Francis was granted a coat of arms in 1561 and the two oldest Barnham sons became country gentlemen. Francis Barnham died in 1576 aged sixty and was buried on 23 May at the parish church of St Clement Eastcheap. His tomb was destroyed in the Great Fire of London. Alice Barnham died in 1604 and was buried on 14 May. Portrait The family portrait is now exhibited at the Denver Art Museum in Colorado. Prior to its purchase in 1998 it hung in Boughton Monchelsea Place, a Kent country house inherited by Sir Francis Barnham in 1613. The subjects of the painting had been mislabelled as Lady Ingram and her Two Boys Martin and Steven for many years due to a paper tag placed on the back of the painting in 1660. This attribution probably occurred because of the close family ties between the Ingram and Barnham families. It has now been relabelled Alice Barnham and her Sons Martin and Steven (1557), because of information contained within trompe l'oeil inscriptions on the painting. Family Of their four sons the third Anthony, probably died soon after his baptism on 18 March 1558, the youngest of the four Benedict (baptised 1559), was a very successful London merchant who amassed one of the great city fortunes of the period, his eldest daughter Elizabeth married Lord Audley the future 2nd Earl of Castlehaven. Martin (died 1610) — a note on the painting says \\"Martin was born the 26 of March at 9 of the clock before noon in Anno Domini 1548\\") — became sheriff of Kent in 1598, was knighted in 1603. Steven (died 1608) — a note on the painting says \\"Steven was born the 21 of July on a Sunday at night and 10 of the clock Anno Domini 1549\\" — became MP for Chichester.

This begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development. The tubular heart quickly differentiates into the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. The truncus arteriosus splits into the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The bulbus cordis forms part of the ventricles. The sinus venosus connects to the fetal circulation. The heart tube elongates on the right side, looping and becoming the first visual sign of left-right asymmetry of the body. Septa form within the atria and ventricles to separate the left and right sides of the heart. Early development The heart derives from embryonic mesodermal germ layer cells that differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium, endothelium, and myocardium. Mesothelial pericardium forms the outer lining of the heart. The inner lining of the heart – the endocardium, lymphatic and blood vessels, develop from endothelium. Endocardial tubes In the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme on either side of the neural plate, a horseshoe-shaped area develops as the cardiogenic region. This has formed from cardiac myoblasts and blood islands as forerunners of blood cells and vessels. By day 19, an endocardial tube begins to develop in each side of this region. These two tubes grow and by the third week have converged towards each other to merge, using programmed cell death to form a single tube, the tubular heart. From splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, the cardiogenic region develops cranially and laterally to the neural plate. In this area, two separate angiogenic cell clusters form on either side and coalesce to form the endocardial tubes. As embryonic folding continues, the two endocardial tubes are pushed into the thoracic cavity, where they begin to fuse together, and this is completed at about 22 days. At around 18 to 19 days after fertilisation, the heart begins to form. This early development is critical for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development. The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 22. The heart begins to develop near the head of the embryo in the cardiogenic area. Following cell signalling, two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic region As these form, a lumen develops within them, at which point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes. At the same time that the tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed. The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. The truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus. Heart tube position The central part of cardiogenic area is in front of the oropharyngeal membrane and the neural plate. The growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the oropharyngeal membrane forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. The curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular infundibulum and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. The tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. Initially the tube remains attached to the dorsal part of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal mesoderm. This mesoderm disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity. The myocardium thickens and secretes a thick layer of rich extracellular matrix containing hyaluronic acid which separates the endothelium. Then mesothelial cells form the pericardium and migrate to form most of the epicardium. Then the heart tube is formed by the endocardium, which is the inner endothelial lining of the heart, and the myocardial muscle wall which is the epicardium that covers the outside of the tube. Heart folding The heart tube continues stretching and by day 23, in a process called morphogenesis, cardiac looping begins. The cephalic portion curves in a frontal clockwise direction. The atrial portion starts moving in a cephalically and then moves to the left from its original position. This curved shape approaches the heart and finishes its growth on day 28. The conduit forms the atrial and ventricular junctions which connect the common atrium and the common ventricle in the early embryo. The arterial bulb forms the trabecular portion of the right ventricle. A cone will form the infundibula blood of both ventricles. The arterial trunk and the roots will form the proximal portion of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The junction between the ventricle and the arterial bulb will be called the primary intra- ventricular hole. The tube is divided into cardiac regions along its craniocaudal axis: the primitive ventricle, called primitive left ventricle, and the trabecular proximal arterial bulb, called the primitive right ventricle. This time no septum is present in heart. Heart chambers Sinus venosus In the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives venous blood from the poles of right and left sinus. Each pole receives blood from three major veins: the vitelline vein, the umbilical vein and the common cardinal vein. The sinus opening moves clockwise. This movement is caused mainly by the left to right shunt of blood, which occurs in the venous system during the fourth and fifth week of development. When the left common cardinal vein disappears in the tenth week only the oblique vein of the left atrium and the coronary sinus remain. The right pole joins the right atrium to form the wall portion of the right atrium. The right and left venous valves fuse and form a peak known as the septum spurium. At the beginning, these valves are large, but over time the left venous valve and the septum spurium fuse with the developing atrial septum. The upper right venous valve disappears, while the bottom venous valve evolves into the inferior valve of the vena cava and the coronary sinus valve. Heart wall The main walls of the heart are formed between day 27 and 37 of the development of the early embryo. The growth consists of two tissue masses actively growing that approach one another until they merge and split light into two separate conduits. Tissue masses called endocardial cushions develop into atrioventricular and conotroncal regions. In these places, the cushions will help in the formation of auricular septum, ventricular conduits, atrio- ventricular valves and aortic and pulmonary channels. Atria The developing heart at day 30. The septum primum (top, middle) develops downwards to separate the initially joined primitive atrium into left and right atria. At the end of the fourth week, a crest grows that leaves the cephalic part. This crest is the first part of the septum primum. The two ends of the septum extend into the interior of the endocardial cushions in the atrioventricular canal. The opening between the bottom edge of the septum primum and endocardial cushions is the ostium primum (first opening). The extensions of the upper and lower endocardial pads grow along the margin of the septum primum and close the ostium primum. Coalescence of these perforations will form the ostium secundum (second opening), which allows blood to flow freely from the right atrium to the left. When the right of the atrium expands due to the incorporation of the pole of the sinus, a new fold appears, called the septum secundum. At its right side it is fused with the left venous valve and the septum spurium. A free opening will then appear, called the foramen ovale. The remains of the upper septum primum, will become the valves of the foramen ovale. The passage between the two atrial chambers consists of a long oblique slit through which blood flows from the right atrium to the left. Ventricles Initially, a single pulmonary vein develops in the form of a bulge in the back wall of the left atrium. This vein will connect with the veins of the developing lung buds. As development proceeds the pulmonary vein and its branches are incorporated into the left atrium and they both form the smooth wall of the atrium. The embryonic left atrium remains as the trabecular left atrial appendage, and the embryonic right atrium remains as the right atrial appendage. Septum formation of the atrioventricular canal At the end of the fourth week, two atrioventricular endocardial cushions appear. Initially the atrioventricular canal gives access to the primitive left ventricle, and is separated from arterial bulb by the edge of the ventricular bulb. In the fifth week, the posterior end terminates in the center part of the upper endocardial cushion. Because of this, blood can access both the left primitive ventricle and the right primitive ventricle. As the anterior and posterior pads project inwardly, they merge to form a right and left atrioventricular orifice. Atrioventricular valves When forming intra- atrial septa, atrio-ventricular valves will begin to grow. A muscular interventricular septum begins to grow from the common ventricle to the atrio- ventricular endocardial cushions. The division begins in the common ventricle where a furrow in the outer surface of the heart will appear the interventricular foramen eventually disappears. This closure is achieved by further growth of the muscular interventricular septum, a contribution of trunk crest-conal tissue and a membranous component. Valves and outflow tracts Truncus septum formation and arterial cone The arterial cone is closed by the infundibular cushions. The trunk cones are closed by the forming of an infundibulotroncal septum, which is made from a straight proximal portion and distal spiral portion. Then, the narrowest portion of the aorta is in the left and dorsal portion. The distal portion of the aorta is pushed forward to the right. The proximal pulmonary artery is right and ventral, and the distal portion of the pulmonary artery is in the left dorsal portion. Pacemaker and conduction system The rhythmic electrical depolarization waves that trigger myocardial contraction is myogenic, which means that they begin in the heart muscle spontaneously and are then responsible for transmitting signals from cell to cell. Myocytes that were obtained in the primitive heart tube, start beating as they connect together by their walls in a syncytium. Myocytes initiate rhythmic electrical activity, before the fusion of the endocardial tubes. The heartbeat begins in the region of the pacemaker which has a spontaneous depolarization time faster than the rest of myocardium. The primitive ventricle acts as initial pacemaker. But this pacemaker activity is actually made by a group of cells that derive from the sinoatrial right venous sinus. These cells form an ovoid sinoatrial node (SAN), on the left venous valve. After the development of the SAN, the superior endocardial cushions begin to form a pacemaker as known as the atrioventricular node. With the development of the SAN, a band of specialized conducting cells start to form creating the bundle of His that sends a branch to the right ventricle and one to the left ventricle. Most conduction pathways originate from the cardiogenic mesoderm but the sinus node may be derived from the neural crest. The human embryonic heart begins beating approximately 21 days after fertilization, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community. The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself. The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads to the rest of the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively. Conductive cells develop the bundle of His and carry the depolarization into the lower heart. Cardiac activity is visible beginning at approximately 5 weeks of pregnancy. The human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother’s, about 75-80 beats per minute (BPM). The embryonic heart rate (EHR) then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165-185 BPM during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 BPM per day, or about 10 BPM every three days, an increase of 100 BPM in the first month.OBGYN.net \\"Embryonic Heart Rates Compared in Assisted and Non-Assisted Pregnancies\\" After peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 150 BPM (+/-25 BPM) during the 15th week after the LMP. After the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 BPM) BPM at term. Imaging Device for obstetric ultrasonography including usage in 1st trimester. Transvaginal ultrasonography of an embryo at 5 weeks and 5 days of gestational age, with discernible cardiac activity (arrow). In the first trimester, the heartbeat can be visualized, and the heart rate quantified by obstetric ultrasonography. A study of 32 normal pregnancies showed that a fetal heartbeat was visible at a mean human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level of 10,000 UI/l (range 8650-12,200). Obstetric ultrasonography can also use Doppler technique on key vessels such as the umbilical artery to detect abnormal flow. Doppler fetal monitor In later stages of pregnancy, a simple Doppler fetal monitor can be used to quantify the fetal heart rate. During childbirth, the parameter is part of cardiotocography, which is where the fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions are continuously recorded. Heart rates Starting at week 5 the embryonic heart rate accelerates by 3.3 bpm per day for the next month. Before this, the embryo possesses a tubular heart. The embryonic heart begins to beat at approximately the same rate as the mother's, which is typically 80 to 85 bpm. The approximate fetal heart rate for weeks 5 to 9 (assuming a starting rate of 80): *Week 5 starts at 80 and ends at 103 bpm *Week 6 starts at 103 and ends at 126 bpm *Week 7 starts at 126 and ends at 149 bpm *Week 8 starts at 149 and ends at 172 bpm *At week 9 the embryonic heart tends to beat within a range of 155 to 195 bpm. By the end of week 9, the embryonic heart has developed septa and valves, and has all four chambers. At this point, the fetal heart rate begins to decrease, and generally falls within the range of 120 to 160 bpm by week 12.FetalSure. Fetal Heart and Heartbeat Facts.

Designed for mobility, it is light and short and intended for home defense and law enforcement. Design details The most unusual feature of the M1216 is the detachable magazine. The magazine which runs parallel to the barrel is made of four tubes, each with its own spring and follower. Each tube can hold four 2 3/4\\" or 3\\" shells for a total of sixteen. When inserted into the gun, the operator can flip a switch and manually rotate the entire magazine, either clockwise or counter clockwise, to choose which tube feeds into the receiver. In a tactical application, by loading different shells in different tubes, this would allow the operator to switch between different types of shells to adapt to a changing scenario, or it could allow rapid fire of all 16 rounds. Once the magazine is empty, pressing the release switch to drop the magazine allows it to be replaced with a full one. The M1216 has a polymer stock to reduce weight and a steel upper receiver. The manual safety, charging handle and ejection port can all be removed and relocated to either the left or right side of the receiver to accommodate the operator's preferences. Picatinny Rails line the top and sides of the shotgun allowing a wide variety of attachments such as sights, lasers, and flashlights to be used. Variants All variants of the Model 1216.

It contains a single species, Albertadromeus syntarsus. Etymology The composite term Albertadromeus is derived from the name of the Canadian province \\"Alberta\\", and the Greek word dromeus (δρομεύς) meaning \\"runner\\", a reference to its inferred cursorial nature; thus \\"runner from Alberta\\". The specific name, syntarsus is derived from Greek words \\"syn\\" (συν) meaning \\"together\\" and \\"tarsus\\" (ταρσός) meaning \\"ankle\\", hence \\"together-ankle\\" a reference to the condition where its distal fibula is fused to its distal tibia. This dinosaur was described and named by Caleb Marshall Brown, David C. Evans, Michael J. Ryan & Anthony P. Russell in 2013 and the type species is Albertadromeus syntarsus. Description The holotype specimen of Albertadromeus TMP 2009.037.0044 consists of two dorsal vertebrae, a caudal vertebra, cervical ribs, ossified tendons, the left tibia and fibula, an incomplete right fibula, and a fragmentary metatarsal and ungual. The skull is unknown in this genus. The authors note that despite the few bones recovered, their moderate quality of preservation nonetheless provides enough morphological detail to allow for diagnosis on the species level. Its elongate tibia has been strongly correlated with cursorial habits.Coombs, W. P., Jr. 1978. Theoretical aspects of cursorial adaptations in dinosaurs. The Quarterly Review of Biology 53:393–418. The tibia of Albertadromeus is slightly more elongate than that of Orodromeus, and significantly more elongate than that of Parksosaurus (ROM 804), Thescelosaurus (USNM 7757 and RSM P 1225.1), Hypsilophodon (NMHUK R5830), Dryosaurus (YPM 1876), and Stegoceras (UALVP 002). Albertadromeus was a small-bodied, bipedal, cursorially adapted (built to run) neornithischian. Diagnosis According to Brown et al. (2013) Albertadromeus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: * The distal fibula is reduced to a thin sheet of bone that is fused to the anterior surface of tibia for the distal one-third of its length (shared with heterodontosaurids) * The lateral condyle of proximal tibia is strongly bilobed (shared with Changchunsaurus, Eocursor, Hypsilophodon, Jeholosaurus, Lesothosaurus, Orodromeus, Oryctodromeus, Stormbergia) * A prominent cnemial crest that projects dorsally (and anterolaterally), resulting in a posterior sloped dorsal extremity of the tibia (also present in Gasparinisaura and Micropachycephalosaurus). Classification Brown et al. (2013) erected a new taxon Orodrominae to differentiate those species that are more closely related to Orodromeus from those more closely related to Thescelosaurus. The validity of this new taxon is supported by the following: (a) the foramen magnum is between 20% and 30% of the width of the occipital condyle; (b) the pubis is articulated with a sacral rib; (c) there is a sharp and pronounced scapular spine; and (d) the fibular shaft is 'D'-shaped in cross-section. The new taxon Orodrominae includes the newly discovered dinosaur Albertadromeus, Zephyrosaurus, Orodromeus and Oryctodromeus. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that Albertadromeus forms a clade with Zephyrosaurus and Orodromeus, with Oryctodromeus being less closely related. The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Brown et al. in 2013, showing the relationships of Albertadromeus: Paleoecology The remains of the type specimen of Albertadromeus was recovered in the Canal Creek locality in the Upper Oldman Formation, which is part of the Belly River Group in Alberta, Canada. The specimen was collected in a two-meter-thick fine to very fine sandstone unit that was deposited during the Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period, approximately 77 to 76 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta. Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Oldman Formation was an ancient coastal plain.Eberth, D.A., and Hamblin, A.P., 1993 , Tectonic, stratigraphic, and sedimentologic significance of a regional discontinuity in the upper Judith River Group (Belly River wedge) of southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and northern Montana: Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 30, 174‒200. This formation has produced the remains of the theropods Saurornitholestes, Daspletosaurus, Troodon, and Dromaeosaurus, the ceratopsids Albertaceratops, Chasmosaurus, Anchiceratops, and Coronosaurus, the hadrosaurids Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Corythosaurus, as well as other dinosaurs that shared that their paleoenvironment with Albertadromeus.

The National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN for its name in Spanish, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica) is one of Mexico's twelve national institutes under the Secretariat of Health. The institute was founded in 2004, with its official headquarters built eight years later. INMEGEN is dedicated to the development of genomic medicine for the Mexican population. The institute carried out research projects aim to improve healthcare through prevention and medical care related to oncogenomics, nutrigenomics and pharmacogenomics. INMEGEN also studies metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune and infectious diseases. INMEGEN collaborates with other Mexican and international institutions for the development of different projects. The current director of the institution is Francisco Xavier Soberón. History The National Institute of Genomic Medicine (Spanish Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica (INMEGEN)) is the eleventh National Institute of Health founded in Mexico. It was founded in 2004 by a consortium made up the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the National Council of Science and Technology of the Ministry of Health and the Mexican Foundation for Health. INMEGEN was the first National Institute of Health created with the support of all political parties in the Congress. The founding ceremony was led by then president Vicente Fox Quesada. The initial investment in the project was 500 million pesos (about 50 million USD), with construction beginning in 2005. In 2008 construction projected was suspended due to an audit by the federal government, but construction continued in 2009. with the main headquarters completed in 2012, eight years after its official founding. The inauguration of this building was carried out by President Felipe Calderón. While construction was taking place, researchers of the institution worked in other locations, on projects such as the Mexican Genome Project. The current director is Francisco Xavier Soberón, who replaced the founder of the INMEGEN Gerardo Jiménez Sánchez in 2009. The National Institute of Genomic Medicine's logo represents the sequence of nucleotides of the FOXP2 gene, essential in the development of language. It has the shape of a semicircle surrounding a double stranded DNA molecule with the shape of a human. Facilities The National Institute of Genomic Medicine is located in Mexico City, on Anillo Periferico in the south of the city, next to the Instituto Federal Electoral. The building has classrooms, two auditoriums and a 500-person auditorium. The Institute also has 18 research laboratories, 6 units of high technology, and 4 peripheral units. Mission According to its mission statement, the National Institute of Genomic Medicine contributes to the health care of Mexican society through research projects. Its objective is not only to improve preventive medical care in the country, but also to expand knowledge of genomic medicine through research in oncogenomics, nutrigenomics, and autoimmune disease genomics, and more. The Institute aims to follow combination of cultural, technological and universal ethics and is concerned in upholding human rights. It has regulations related to administer biological samples and genome of the Mexican population. With this regulation the INMEGEN prevents discrimination against individuals or cultures because of genetics. Lines of investigation The National Institute of Genomic Medicine centers its attention on two main objectives, development of preventive medicine and the design of medical treatments tailored to a person's genetic makeup. INMEGEN employs approximately sixty scientists dedicated to the genome research. Currently the Institution is carrying out several different projects. INMEGEN studies several types of cancer. These investigations involve functional cancer genomics and oncogenomics, including breast, pancreatic, prostate and liver cancer. INMEGEN studies the molecular biomarkers of early liver cancer. It is developing keys for the identification of genes which show a significant increase or decrease in their expression level of fibrosis in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the liver. Other research focuses on biomarkers that help identify liver cancer in a differential diagnosis. Additional cancer studies include creating 3D models of diverse tumor cultures. INMEGEN also investigates the participation of progesterone in brain tumors and the identification of proteins that participate in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. INMEGEN is developing the cancer genome of the Mexican population. Researchers at INMEGEN also study Werner syndrome and the pulmonary adenocarcinoma. INMEGEN has many investigations related to proteins. One example is the development of fluorescent biosensors to help detect diabetes mellitus type II as well as other metabolic diseases. Other project is the decodification of the AH1N1 flu virus, with research into the genetic susceptibility of the Mexican population to acquire this illness. In order to do this the AH1N1flu biomarkers based on protein structure need to be identified. This is useful for diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up. The Institute is also working on determining the mutations that make mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to medication. Proteomics studies involve the analysis of protein additions of lipid peroxidation at liver carcinogenesis. INMEGEN studies how proteins are affected by the immune system in papillomavirus infection. The institution develops projects related to pharmacogenomics, which includes personalized medicine. One of the Institutions pharmacogenomics investigations is working with the doses guided by genotype-phenotype and in their standard management in patients who initiate anticoagulation with acenocoumarol. INMEGEN studies metabolic diseases and nutrigenomics-related topics. These include obesity, especially its effects on children. INMEGEN has worked with the mutation of a gene associated with Pompe disease. This study is carried out in individuals genetically isolated of the La Huasteca area of San Luis Potosí. Another study is on the effect of Omega 3 on metabolic syndrome in the Mexican population, specifically on early biomarkers presented in the diabetic nephropathy and the risk factors for developing obesity. The Institution has a line of research focused on cardiovascular diseases genomics. For example, INMEGEN works on gene identification in individuals with premature coronary and arterial diseases and atherosclerosis. INMEGEN studies the susceptibility of the Mexican population to acquire coronary and artery diseases. Another project is related to family cardiomyopathy in Mexican patients. Investigations into population genomics studies the genomic diversity of the native populations in Mexico. The purpose of this is for evolution studies that may have applications in health care. It also includes the ethnic variability in multiple sclerosis patients. The Institution works on other several lines of investigation. INMEGEN uses computational genomics for data mapping a genome for a specific purpose. In autoinmune genomics, INMEGEN investigates the risk factors for juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the Mexican population. In the case of bone metabolism genomics, the institution focuses on studying mineral density and osteoporosis in Mexican women. For the same population INMEGEN uses microRNA as biomarkers for osteoarthritis. Finally, INMEGEN investigates about asthma in children and amebiasis in the general Mexican population. INMEGEN also works on identifying the biomarkers for hypercholesterolemia. Collaborations INMEGEN has established collaborations with both Mexican and international institutions, such as those in other Latin American countries. With the National Autonomous University of Mexico, it created a population genomics unit, which sponsors various investigations about diabetes and obesity in the Mexican population. In 2008 INMEGEN and the Mexico City government signed an agreement for the elaboration of the complete genome map of the mestizo population of the country’s capital. This project was developed to determine the predisposition of this population to diabetes mellitus and obesity. For this task, ten thousand individuals donated blood samples. INMEGEN, like other research institutions, experiences “brain drain”, which is Mexican talented scientists leaving the country because of the lack of opportunities. In collaboration with CONACYT, they hope to repatriate Mexican scientists so they can work at INMEGEN. Nestlé and INMEGEN developed an association to work on nutrigenomics, also concerned with bringing back Mexican scientists to work at this field. Nestlé offers them a salary and paying moving expenses to make them come back.

Early life  Lassiter was born in 1928 in North Carolina. His parents were cotton sharecroppers, and Lassiter began singing after joining his uncles' gospel group. At the age of 14, he moved to Newark, New Jersey to live with his mother, who had moved there for work. While in Newark, Lassiter performed with the Jubilaires. Lassiter married his first wife, Neaty Ann (née Butler), with whom he had two children Etta D. and Arthur F. Art Lassiter later joined the United States Army and served during the Korean War. While stationed in the Far East, he performed in officers' clubs and took up boxing, competing under the name Artie Wilkins (taking his step-father's surname).  Career  After leaving active service, Lassiter returned to the United States. During a cross-country drive, he broke down in St. Louis. While there he sang at an amateur club night, and was given a permanent booking. He often sang covers of Ray Charles songs, and formed The Bel-Airs with brothers George and Murrey Green and Douglas Martin. By late 1955, the band renamed themselves The Trojans and recorded with RPM Records, backing Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm. The group backed Turner again the following February, this time on Federal Records under the name of The Rockers. Turner offered Lassiter a place in his Rhythm Revue, where he subsequently met and worked with Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, and Albert Cook. In March 1960, Turner chose Lassiter to front the Kings of Rhythm. Lassiter's trio of backup singers — Robbie Montgomery, Frances Hodges, and Sandra Harding – were called The Artettes, and eventually formed the foundation of The Ikettes. Ike Turner wrote \\"A Fool in Love\\" specifically for Lassiter, but Lassiter failed to turn up to the song's recording session at the expensive Technosonic Studios in St Louis. Tina Turner—then going by the stage name Little Ann—knew the song from rehearsal sessions, and recorded a guide track to act as a demo. Lassiter's failure to appear for the session was around the time he had disagreements with Ike Turner over financial matters which ended his partnership with Turner.  Later life and death  In 1977 Lassiter settled in Washington with then wife Thelma Lassiter and three children Christine, Arthur Jr., and Lydia. During this time Art performed at many local blues festivals and local venues acquiring a substantial local following. Lassiter spent his final years with his third wife, Ruth Lindgren and two children Miriam and Linnea. He died on August 4, 1994 from throat cancer. Lassiter had a son, Andre Montgomery (1961–1995) with his former background vocalist Robbie Montgomery.

The term refers to certain self-serving tendencies of the human intellect, often involving professional producers and disseminators of ideas, who work with idea-formation all the time. Intellectual opportunism sometimes also refers to a specific school or trend of thought, or to a characteristic of a particular intellectual development. Thus, a certain set of people who share ideas are then said to display a tendency for \\"intellectual opportunism\\", often with the connotation that they deliberately act intellectually in a certain way, to gain special favor with an authority, group or organization; to justify a state of affairs that benefits themselves; or because they have the motive of financial or personal gain. Background At issue is the motive and intention involved in pursuing, creating, or expressing particular ideas (why certain ideas are being taken up), and the relevant contrast is between: * the intellectual's stated principles, versus ideas he publicly or outwardly supports, endorses or concerns himself with. * the original intention of ideas such as it is normally understood, versus the uses they are put to. \\"Theoretical opportunism\\" in science refers to the attempt to save a theory from refutation, or protect it from criticism, with the use of ad hoc methods that in some way lack deeper scientific consistency or credibility. Theorists may believe so strongly in the value of their own theory, that they try to explain away inconsistencies or contrary evidence – borrowing any idea that plausibly fits with the theory, rather than developing the theory in such a way, that it can truly account for the relevant evidence. The phenomenon of intellectual opportunism is frequently associated by its critics with careerism and dubious, unprincipled self-promotion, where ideas become \\"just another commodity\\" or a \\"bargaining tool\\". When human knowledge becomes a tradeable good in a market of ideas, all sorts of opportunities arise for huckstering, swindling, haggling and hustling with information in ways which are regarded as unprincipled, dubious or involve deceit of some sort. Morality The intellectual opportunist adapts his intellectual concerns, pursuits and utterances to \\"fit with the trend/fashion\\" or \\"fit the situation\\" or \\"with what sells\\" – with the (ulterior) motive of gaining personal popularity/support, protecting intellectual coherence, obtaining personal credit, acquiring privilege or status, persuading others, ingratiating himself, taking advantage or making money. Normally this assumes some degree of intellectual flexibility, agility or persuasiveness. The intellectual opportunist: * \\"Holds his mouth where the money or the support is\\" or where the opportunities for self-advancement or self-promotion are. * \\"Hires out\\" his own ideas for purposes that conflict with his real nature or the organization he works for, only for the purpose of gaining personal advantage. * Latches onto any readily available ideas or \\"picks the brains of others\\" to advance or defend his own position. * Compromises what he really believes in, for the sake of some ulterior motive or purpose.Jim Quilty, \\"Political realities and intellectual opportunism.\\" The Daily Star (Beirut), 19 May 2006. Often intellectual opportunism is therefore understood as a sign of lack of integrity or intellectual shallowness, to the extent that the opportunist is not concerned with the worth of the ideas in themselves, but only with how he can benefit from them himself by pursuing them. As a corollary, the intellectual opportunist is often apt to change his opinions, and \\"change his line\\" rapidly or arbitrarily, according to where he can gain personal advantage, in a manner not consistent or principled. The implication is usually that ideas are no longer being pursued because of their intrinsic merit or worth, or out of a genuine concern with what is at stake in an argument or idea, but only because of the instrumental value of ideas, i.e., the selfish advantage that can be gained from pursuing some ideas in preference to other ones. Observably ventilating or \\"advertising\\" suitably formulated ideas is then merely a means or a \\"tool\\" for self-advancement or the promotion of a group or organization, giving rise to accusations that the real intention of particular ideas is being twisted around to serve an alien or improper purpose. The general outcome may be that the ideas involved, though plausible at a superficial level, lack any deeper coherence, the coherence being ruled out by lack of regard for relevant principles. Intellectual \\"dilettantes\\" (people who do not truly know what they are talking about, i.e. dabblers) are often regarded as opportunists, insofar as they like to side with whatever viewpoint seems to be popular or credible at the time. Perception Intellectual opportunism may appear obvious or crass, if the selfish motives for engaging in it are clear. It may also be very difficult to detect if: *the intellectual opportunist is clever and intelligent, while his audience is not, or his audience lacks sufficient relevant information to \\"judge the intellectual act\\". A clever intellectual opportunist may be able to reconcile his changing stories and his ulterior selfish motives in such a way, that his intellectual concerns seem perfectly principled and consistent. *it is very difficult to distinguish between legitimately seizing an intellectual opportunity with sincere motives, and using an intellectual opportunity for some selfish, ulterior motive. *the intellectual opportunist is himself not aware of his own opportunism, i.e. what it means, or what its broader significance is, regarding his own pursuit of intellectual opportunities as perfectly legitimate. In this case, the true motives or the effects of a course of action may be unclear or in dispute.\\"...opportunists almost never believe that is what they are. They believe they are making reasonable adjustments to circumstances, and when they do acknowledge that they are doing wrong, we generally note the absence of real guilt in their voices and the worldly smile that tells us they think themselves wrong only by conventional standards, not by the standards of real life.\\" Neal O. Weiner, The harmony of the soul: mental health and moral virtue reconsidered. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993, p.85. *the relevant and appropriate moral norms are themselves in dispute, so that the validity of the assessment of \\"opportunism\\" in intellectual behaviour depends on \\"point of view\\". To prove intellectual opportunism by an individual or a group may therefore require very comprehensive knowledge pertaining to the case. An additional complicating factor is the influence of cultural differences on human intentions. Behavior regarded as opportunist in one culture may not be so regarded in another because of differences in norms of moral propriety. For example, in American culture there is a much greater preoccupation with self- marketing, advertising and self-promotion, which in European countries might be regarded as crass opportunism, because the culturally appropriate ways to assert self-interest or self-concern are different. There may however be just as much opportunism in Europe as anywhere else, but with a different cultural style. People may say, \\"all's fair in love and war\\", but that also means that if one can represent something as a war or a matter of love, one can justify any action, since love and war permit actions that would ordinarily be regarded as unprincipled or illegitimate.

It contains a single species, Proxilodon bonneri, (formerly \\"Euryodus\\" bonneri).  History of study  There is only one known specimen of Proxilodon bonneri, the former holotype of Euryodus bonneri, named by Schultze & Foreman (1981). It was collected in 1976 by Brian Foreman from a roadcut site in Kansas in the lower Speiser Formation (often called the Speiser Shale) that preserves primarily aquatic vertebrates, such as the lungfish Gnathorhiza, the dvinosaur temnospondyl Acroplous vorax, the nectridean lepospondyl Diplocaulus, and the lysorophian Lysorophus tricarinatus. The species was named after Orville Bonner, who prepared the specimen, a complete skull with the left lower jaw in articulation and associated vertebrae and a fragmentary humerus. Huttenlocker et al. (2013) identified numerous differences from other species of Euryodus and erected the new genus Proxilodon, derived from a Latinized version of the Greek 'Euryodus,' which means 'broad-tooth' and which was the original taxonomic identification; 'proxilus' in Latin for broad/wide, and '-odon' refers to 'tooth.'  Anatomy  As with gymnarthrids like Euryodus, Proxilodon possesses a long postorbital region and a slightly convex occiput, but it also has a much narrower skull than is typical of Euryodus and a higher premaxillary tooth count, among other features, that differentiate it from gymnarthrids at large. Other features listed in the diagnosis include a small notch in the premaxilla that articulates with the nasal, a nasal longer than it is broad (in line with the generally narrow skull), and the absence of a pineal foramen, instead being replaced by a shallow fossa. The holotype skull is typically sized for 'microsaurs,' measuring slightly less than 19 mm in length. Most of the internal anatomy is obscured by the articulation with the skull.  Relationships  A phylogenetic analysis of the position of Proxilodon, and another novel taxon, Huskerpeton, by Huttenlocker et al. (2013) recovered Proxilodon as a recumbirostran microsaur within a clade formed by gymnarthrids, ostodolepids, and their relatives.

Sexual opportunism is sometimes also defined as the use of sexual favours for selfish purposes quite unrelated to the sexual activity, in which case taking a sexual opportunity is merely the means to achieve a quite different purpose, for example to advance one's career or obtain status or money.Graham Scambler, \\"Sex Work Stigma: Opportunist Migrants in London\\". Sociology, vol. 41, no. 6, December 2007, pp. 1079-1096. This may be accepted or tolerated, or it may be criticized because the concerns of others are not adequately taken into consideration (or because it is contrary to authentic sexual love). To the extent that the feelings, wishes, intentions, purposes, interests or norms of others are not adequately considered in the pursuit of sexual gratification, it then conflicts with some or other principle for appropriate behaviour, and it may involve deceit or dishonesty (for example, the deliberate exploitation of sexual innocence). In that case, the sexual opportunist is considered to lack sexual and/or personal integrity. In a clinical or scientific sense, sexual opportunism is often straightforwardly described as observable sexual promiscuity or the observable propensity to engage in casual sex, whatever the motive. Sexual opportunism can sometimes be defined as the use of sexual favours for selfish purposes quite unrelated to the sexual activity, in which case taking a sexual opportunity is merely the means to achieve a quite different purpose. In example, to advance one's career or obtain status or money. This may be accepted or tolerated, or it may be criticized because the concerns of others are not adequately taken into consideration (or because it is contrary to authentic sexual love). To the extent that the feelings, wishes, intentions, purposes, interests or norms of others are not adequately considered in the pursuit of sexual gratification, it then conflicts with some or other principle for appropriate behaviour, and it may involve deceit or dishonesty (for example, the deliberate exploitation of sexual innocence). In that case, the sexual opportunist is considered to lack sexual and/or personal integrity. Sexual opportunism has always been a much disputed concept, because: *moral norms for the legitimate pursuit of sexual desire are often not agreed upon, or influenced by different religious, cultural or spiritual beliefs. The range of sexual behaviours tolerated or not tolerated can vary greatly across time and place. In some cultures, for example, there are very strong social sanctions against \\"sex purely for the sake of sex\\", in other cultures this is regarded more as a private or personal matter, unless it involves unlawful activity. Inversely, the use of sex for a purpose or function unrelated to the sexual activity itself may be tolerated in one context or place, and proscribed in another (see also prostitution and sex tourism). *because a discrepancy between motives considered appropriate, and purely selfish or self-serving motives, may be very difficult to establish, even for the people involved, particularly if an allegedly \\"opportunist\\" sexual advance is validated by its acceptance by a potential sexual partner, who responds positively to the opportunity out of personal free will. Thus the exact boundary between \\"seizing a sexual opportunity\\" and \\"sexual opportunism\\" may in practice be difficult to distinguish. Often sexual seduction involves precisely the \\"disguise\\" of sexual motive, and an attempt to persuade a potential sexual partner that more, or other (honourable) motives are involved than just sex, which may or may not be true—without this being easily verifiable—even for the persons involved themselves. The complicating factor is that the motivations or intentions involved in a sexual attraction may not be clear even to those who are party to it. In a clinical or scientific sense, sexual opportunism is often straightforwardly described as observable sexual promiscuity or the observable propensity to engage in casual sex, whatever the motive. Such an \\"objective\\" description is used, because: * it may not clear or provable that such behaviour conflicts with relevant principles (unless it demonstrably involves unlawful behaviour). *what matters for medical, juridical or scientific purposes is primarily that it occurs, irrespective of what the motives are, or how those motives are morally judged by the people involved or by others. *because the judgment that the motives involved are \\"selfish\\" or signify \\"irresponsibility\\" depends on one's point of view and cannot, or not easily, be objectively or scientifically established. Promiscuous behaviour or the pursuit of casual sex can occur in varying degrees, or be circumstantial, but can also be motivated by some kind of sexual addiction or hypersexuality in which the opportunist actively \\"preys\\" on people who are most likely to satisfy his sexual desires, or are easily available for sexual activity (\\"an easy lay\\"). The practice is normally considered pathological only if it significantly harms the sexual opportunist himself, and/or significantly harms his (potential) sexual partners – in a physical or psychological sense – or if it involves unlawful activity (see also Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations). The definition of \\"harm\\" involved may however be contested, insofar as it is not obvious and open to interpretation.

Background Appam On January 15, 1916, the British steamship was captured off the Canary Islands by the German auxiliary cruiser . A 22-man prize crew, and 138 passengers taken from other captured ships, were put aboard and she was taken to Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving on February 1. Appams British owner, the British and African Steam Navigation Co, filed suit to recover possession of her from her captors. Federal Judge Edmund Waddill of Virginia, in a 15,000-word opinion, directed, July 29, 1916, that the vessel, with the cargo remaining aboard her and the proceeds of the perishable cargo already sold, should be restored at once to her British owners.  Supreme Court  The German government appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which on March 6, 1917 handed down a decision that a belligerent nation may not bring prizes of war into a neutral port. The Supreme Court held that it would be unneutral for the United States to permit either belligerent to bring prizes into American ports, and that Germany could not claim such right under any of the existing treaties between that country and the United States. In bringing Appam into an American port, it was held, the German officials were committing a clear breach of American neutrality. Ship and cargo, valued at between three and four million dollars, were delivered to the British owners March 28, 1917. The decision, written by Justice William R. Day, affirmed decrees by Federal Judge Waddill, and upheld the original ruling by Secretary of State Robert Lansing that prizes coming into American ports unaccompanied by captor warships have the right to remain only long enough to make themselves seaworthy. The court stated that neither the Treaty of 1799 with Prussia, the Hague conventions nor the Declaration of London, entitled any belligerents to make American ports a place of deposit of prizes as spoils of war under such circumstances. The opinion adds: > The principles of international law, leaving the treaty aside, will not > permit the ports of the United States to be thus used by the belligerents. > If such use were permitted, it would constitute the ports of a neutral > nation harbors of safety into which prizes might be safely brought and > indefinitely kept. From the beginning of its history this country has been > careful to maintain a neutral position between warring governments, and not > to allow use of its ports in violation of the obligations of neutrality, nor > to permit such use beyond the necessities arising from perils of the seas or > the necessities of such vessels as to seaworthiness, provisions and > supplies. Aftermath After return to its initial owners, the ship was renamed for the rest of the war before reverting to her original name in 1919. Thereafter she traded for many years on routes to West Africa and was scrapped in 1936.

It is named after its large head, which is the largest of any plesiosaur in the continent and measures up to in length. Megacephalosaurus was one of the largest marine reptiles of its time with an estimated length of . Its long snout and consistently sized teeth suggest that it preferred a diet on smaller-sized prey. Remains representing the pliosaur include two fossil skulls, three ribs, and a neural arch. The fossils have been found in deposits of the Carlile Shale and Greenhorn Limestone in Kansas and elsewhere in the midwestern United States. First discovered in 1950, they were originally thought to have been giant fossils of a closely related pliosaur known as Brachauchenius lucasi. But by 2013, paleontologists understood that such fossils belonged to a distinct animal. Megacephalosaurus was among the last known pliosaurs. Description Two specimens pertaining to Megacephalosaurus are known. Both represent fossil skulls. The holotype is FHSM VP-321, which consists of a nearly complete skull, three cervical ribs, and a cervical neural arch. The second specimen, USNM 50136, is designated as the paratype specimen. It consists of a partial skull containing parts of the upper jaw and some cranial bones. The skull of Megacephalosaurus is the largest known for any plesiosaur from North America to date. FHSM VP-321 measures in length when measuring along the midline of the cranium and the length of the lower jaw measures . UNSM 50136, although incomplete, is much larger than FHSM VP-321 and is estimated to have measured when it was complete. Based on understandings from fossils of other pliosaurs the skull likely equated to about one-fifth to one- fourth of total body length. This would yield a range of in total body length for Megacephalosaurus. The snout is very elongate, making up around two-thirds of the total skull length. It tapers to a point with a small rostrum before the first teeth. The dentary, which houses the lower teeth, also takes up around two-thirds of the total length of the lower jaw. The upper jaws possess twenty-two functional teeth on the right side and twenty-three teeth on the left; four of the frontmost pairs are located on the premaxilla while the rest are located on the maxilla. Unlike in pliosaurs such as Liopleurodon or Pliosaurus, the maxillary teeth in Megacephalosaurus do not reduce in size towards the base of the skull and are all consistently large. A pair of small pits measuring less than long is present just before the frontmost pair of functional teeth. It is believed that pits represent vestigial dental alveoli that once held an additional pair of teeth in ancestral species but devolved in Megacephalosaurus. Almost all pliosaurs normally have five pairs of premaxillary teeth and this feature of reduction to four pairs is fairly unique among pliosaurs; it has only been documented elsewhere in Kronosaurus, Brachauchenius and Acostasaurus, indicating that the reduction to four pairs of premaxillary teeth may have been a novel adaptation introduced by Cretaceous pliosaurs. The lower jaws bear twenty-three pairs of functional teeth. Only the five frontmost pairs are relatively large, all teeth subsequent of them get progressively smaller as they progress towards the base of the dentary in a smooth transition. The sixth to fifteenth lower jaw teeth are considered to be intermediate-sized, and all teeth posterior to such are considered small. The teeth are conical, ending at a pointed tip, and are slightly curved towards the tongue and away from the midline of the jaw. The teeth are fairly large and the largest teeth known in Megacephalosaurus measure up to approximately in crown height. The enamel features patterns of long, thin, and convex ridges known as apicobasal ridges that run in the direction from the crown base to tip. Approximately half of these ridges, spaced 13–16 per centimeter of crown circumference, reach the full length of the crown. The function of apicobasal ridges in the teeth has been proposed to be to improve gripping and puncturing prey. The ribs are similar in general shape with those in typical Jurassic pliosaurs. However, ribs of Megacephalosaurus are double-headed, meaning that the head of the rib is structured for attachment at two points of a vertebra. This is a completely unique feature among Cretaceous pliosaurs, of which all but Megacephalosaurus lack. Double-headed ribs have been present in some Jurassic pliosaurs and it was previously thought that this feature disappeared with their extinction. Discovery and history Initial identification as Brachauchenius lucasi Brachauchenius lucasi. The first specimen of Megacephalosaurus was discovered by two teenage brothers named Frank and Robert Jennrich while collecting fossil shark teeth near Fairport, Kansas. The skull was found bottom-side up and completely crushed into a thin layer. Recognizing the significance of their discovery, the brothers corresponded with paleontologist George F. Sternberg and led him to the fossil during the fall of 1950. Sternberg identified the locality to likely be either the Greenhorn Limestone or Graneros Shale with a nearby fossil including that of a Xiphactinus. The three men, with the help of a local cow-herder named Jim Rouse, excavated the skull by late October of the same year. The land on which the fossil was found was owned by Otto C. Eulert (making the fossil his property), who subsequently donated the specimen to the Sternberg Museum of Natural History. This specimen was cataloged as FHSM VP-321. Sternberg wrote to Eulert on November 2, 1950, that he initially thought the fossil belonged to a large mosasaur. However, he quickly changed his identification to that of a plesiosaur. After conferring with Samuel Paul Welles of UC Berkeley and other paleontologists during the 1950 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Sternberg identified FHSM VP-321 as the Late Cretaceous pliosaur Brachauchenius lucasi. Although additional associated fossils of the specimen were recovered during its excavation, Sternberg had the skull and left lower jaw embedded on a mount of plaster and displayed it in the museum's public exhibits by 1951. Reexamination and redescription The identification of the supposed Brachauchenuis lucasi skull that is FHSM VP-321 was unquestioned for decades. Even a study done in 1996 on the mounted skull identified it as such as the diagnostic features of the dorsal sides of the skull, which was the only parts of the skull visible, were still characteristic of B. lucasi. In November 2003, Robert Jennrich led staff members of the Sternberg Museum to the original locality where he and his brother discovered the specimen. Scientists found that this locality was not of the Greenhorn Limestone or Ganeros Shale as Sternberg initially presumed, but instead of the Fairport Chalk Member of the Carlile Shale, dated approximately 92.9 . Paleontologists began to doubt the identification of FHSM VP-321 when in 2007 the Sternberg Museum curator Mike Everhart discovered photos of the skull's underside taken prior to its mounting, which revealed underside features that were different from those found in other B. lucasi skulls. To confirm the perceived differences, FHSM VP-321 was arranged to be removed from its mount and Everhart collaborated with paleontologists Bruce A. Schumacher of the USDA Forest Service and Kenneth Carpenter of the USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum in a study to examine the underside of the skull. The study, which was published in 2013, found the skull bore several unique features that made it distinct from B. lucasi and concluded that FHSM VP-321 was a distinct genus of pliosaur. It was named Megacephalosaurus eulerti, with the generic name being a portmanteau of the Ancient Greek μέγας (mégas, \\"great\\") and κεφαλή (kephalḗ, \\"head\\") prefixed onto σαῦρος (saûros, \\"lizard\\") in reference to the size of the skull, and the specific epithet being an honor of Eulert for his donation of the fossil. The history of the paratype skull UNSM 50136 was unclear when it was first examined by Schumacher in a 2008 study. When it was recovered from the collections of the University of Nebraska State Museum for study, there was strangely no contextual information or records pertaining to the large fossil. The few reputed information on the skull included one that simply stated it originated from Kansas, leading Schumacher to speculate that it may have originally been within the collections of the Sternberg Museum and was obtained by the University of Nebraska during a fossil exchange. No stratigraphic data was recorded for USNM 50136, but tests on a piece of matrix extracted from the fossil identified nannofossil assemblages that are most associated with deposits of the Greenhorn Limestone likely dated around 93.9 mya at earliest. Schumacher concluded that USNM 50136 was a species with affinities to B. lucasi and that it could either expand the definition of the taxon or be of an entirely new species, assigning the open nomenclature aff. Brachauchenius lucasi. When FHSM VP-321 was found to be a distinct genus, USNM 50136 was identified to be conspecific with it and was assigned to be its paratype. Additional fossils currently identified as B. lucasi may actually belong of Megacephalosaurus. For example, Everhart expressed possibility that UNSM 112437, a partial skull recovered from the Graneros Shale and labeled as B. lucasi, is actually another possible representative of Megacephalosaurus. Classification Megacephalosaurus is a member of the subfamily Brachaucheninae, which consists of pliosaurs that are currently only known during the Cretaceous period. Phylogenetic analyses of all known Cretaceous pliosaurs have consistently recovered them within the subfamily, which led to a hypothesis that it was the only lineage of pliosaurs that crossed the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous. However, these patterns may have been due to large gaps in the fossil record, particularly an absence of pliosaur fossils during many stages of the Early Cretaceous. Recent discoveries of Early Cretaceous pliosaur teeth exhibiting distinct teeth characteristics now challenge the hypothesis and alternatively suggests that at least one more lineage crossed the Jurassic-Cretaceous divide. Members of the Brachaucheninae are variable and only one uniting characteristic between all is known; the possession of somewhat circularly-shaped teeth rather than full or somewhat trihedral-shaped teeth seen in some Jurassic pliosaurs. Some characteristics that are shared by most brachauchenines like Megacephalosaurus includes skull features (such as an elongated snout, gracile rostrum, and consistently sized teeth) that are better adapted for a general evolutionary shift towards smaller prey. However, there are notable exceptions such as Kronosaurus, which has teeth that are each shaped differently. A 2018 study by Daniel Madzia of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Sven Sachs of the Natural History Museum, Bielefeld, and Johan Lindgren of Lund University hypothesized that the presence of these inconsistencies indicates that the trait for consistently-sized teeth evolved independently within the Brachaucheninae three times; these occurrences being independently in Luskhan, Stenorhynchosaurus, and in a clade that includes Megacephalosaurus and Brachauchenius. An early phylogenetic attempt including a Megacephalosaurus specimen was performed in a 2012 study led by Roger Benson of the University of Oxford. It recovered FHSM VP-321 in a clade in which it is basal to another clade that includes Brachauchenius and Kronosaurus. In 2013, Benson led another study that attempted another phylogenetic analysis using a better description of FHSM VP-321 made by Schumacher et al. (2013). This time, the study recovered FHSM VP-321 from a polytomy clade shared by Brachauchenius and a pliosaur specimen cataloged as DORK/G/1-2 but doubtfully labeled as 'Polyptychodon interruptus', with one outgroup consisting of Kronosaurus, under a strict reduced consensus. In an alternate strict consensus analysis, the study recovered the FHSM VP-321 from a polytomy clade that includes Pliosaurus and Gallardosaurus. Another study published in 2015 by Andrea Caua and Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna yielded similar phylogenetic results in a strict consensus method. Madzia et al. (2018) attempted multiple phylogenetic analyses with different methods of consensus. All strict consensus methods recovered Megacephalosaurus from a polytomy clade only shared by Brachauchenius, Kronosaurus, and DORK/G/1-2, while some majority rule consensus methods saw Megacephalosaurus fall in a clade that had a polytomy with DORK/G/1-2 but derived from a clade shared with Kronosaurus and basal to a clade that includes Brachauchenius. The cladogram below is modified from Madzia et al. (2018). Paleoecology The Western Interior Seaway during the time of Megacephalosaurus Megacephalosaurus was among the very last of the pliosaurs. It inhabited the Western Interior Seaway that spanned the middle of North America and cut it in two during the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The pliosaur was present during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, a period marked with significant worldwide faunal turnovers and extinctions caused by an abnormally intense increase in underwater volcanism, which ushered a global anoxic event that acidified the oceans, increased global temperatures, and caused a mass extinction that led to the disappearance of 26% of all marine fauna. Despite this, the vertebrate assemblages in the Western Interior Seaway remained stable throughout the ordeal as many of the taxa are also known from deposits before and after the boundary. The fossil assemblages of the Turonian-aged portions of the Fairport Chalk and Greenhorn Shale are considered small in terms of the number of present species but nevertheless encompassed a wide ecological diversity. Sharks constituted the majority of vertebrate diversity, of which Cretoxyrhina and Squalicorax were the most common. Other types of sharks that were present included the mackerel sharks Cretalamna, Cardabiodon, Cretodus, Archaeolamna and Dallasiella, the durophagous Ptychodus, and the sand shark Johnlongia. Several bony fish are also known. Many of their fossils are too fragmentary to be properly identified, but known Turonian taxa include but not limited to Enchodus, Pachyrhizodus, and the ichthyodectids Ichthyodectes and Xiphactinus. While consistent in fauna, the abundance of fish fossils from the Turonian- aged Fairport Chalk and Greenhorn Shale are significantly lower than such from older deposits such as an earlier deposit of the Greenhorn Shale below the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary that has yielded hundreds to thousands of fish fossils. However, this may simply be a case of collecting bias. Of the marine reptiles, plesiosaurs – including the polycotylid Trinacromerum, pliosaurs such as Brachauchenius and Megacephalosaurus itself, and indeterminate elasmosaurs – sea turtles, the crocodylomorph Terminonaris, the marine squamate Coniasaurus, and plioplatecarpine mosasaurs have been found within the Turonian Fairport Chalk and/or Greenhorn Shale. The Turonian also marked the beginning of the radiation of mosasaurs, coinciding with the temporal range of Megacephalosaurus, which would have encountered such marine reptiles. The temporal range of Megacephalosaurus extends past the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary and after the anoxic event. By this point, only three known pliosaur taxa remained: itself, Brachauchenius, and Polyptychodon. All three pliosaurs disappeared during the progression of the Turonian stage, marking the extinction of the pliosaurs. It has been hypothesized that this final demise may have been linked with the rise of polycotylids, which have been rapidly diversifying around the same time.

Compare for example: History The political philosophy of Niccolò Machiavelli as described in The Prince is often regarded as a classic manual of opportunist scheming, and indeed a Machiavellian is nowadays defined as \\"a cunning, amoral, and opportunist person, especially a politician\\". Definition Political opportunism is interpreted in different ways, but usually refers to one or more of the following: *a political style of aiming to increase one's political influence at any price, or a political style that involves seizing every and any opportunity to extend political influence, whenever such opportunities arise. *the practice of abandoning or compromising in reality some important political principles that were previously held, in the process of trying to increase one's political power and influence. *a trend of thought, or a political tendency, seeking to make political capital out of situations with the main aim being that of gaining more influence, prestige or support, instead of truly winning people over to a principled position or improving their political understanding. *believing that there is much more at work behind the scenes for the combining of alliances, making of pacts and signing of agreements for a cause. *having experiencing suffering for a political cause, without real political positions and/or beliefs being revealed in the process, though with or without critique. Typically, opportunist political behavior is criticized for being short-sighted or narrow-minded.See e.g. Caroline B. Glick, \\"Column one: Israel's premier opportunist\\". In: Jerusalem Post, 22 July 2011. That is, in the urge to make short-term political gains or preserve them, the appropriate relationship between the means being used and the overall goals being aimed for is overlooked. The result might well be, that \\"short term gain\\" leads to \\"long term pain\\". Thus, after opportunist mistakes have been made and recognized, a lot of soul searching may occur, or \\"a return to principles\\" may be advocated, so that the proper relationship between people's principles and their actions is restored.For example: \\"Pragmatists say, \\"I would rather be an opportunist and float than go to the bottom with my principles around my neck.\\" The message of the European elections for the left says exactly the opposite: It's your broken principles that sink you.\\" - Daniel Singer, \\"As Europe Turns\\". The Nation, 4 May 1992. Most politicians are \\"opportunists\\" to some extent at least (they aim to utilize political opportunities creatively to their advantage, and have to try new initiatives), but the controversies surrounding the concept concern the exact relationship between \\"seizing a political opportunity\\" and the political principles being espoused. In other words, the question is \\"how far you can go\\" without compromising principles or abandoning an agreed-on code of ethics. There may be no quick and easy answer to that, because whether a transgression has occurred cannot be verified, is known only later, or is in dispute. This happens particularly in a new situation where it is uncertain how principles should be applied, or how people should respond to it. *Accusations of \\"opportunism\\" may be made without proof being available, and they may be open to debate. In this sense, Milton Friedman remarked that \\"One man's opportunism is another man's statesmanship\\".Playboy magazine, February 1973 issue. Quoted in The cynic's lexicon: a dictionary of amoral advice by Jonathon Green (Routledge 1984), p. 77. The interviewer, Michael Laurence, asked \\"Aren’t you saying that there’s been a large element of political opportunism in Nixon’s reversals?\\" and Friedman replied: \\"One man’s opportunism is another’s statesmanship. There is a very delicate balance between the two in our society. Good politics is what we should demand from our politicians—to a degree. We don’t want our leaders to charge off in every direction trying to satisfy the latest public whim, but neither do we want them to completely ignore the will of the people. I think Nixon acted properly. The real problem is educating the public, and there he was unsuccessful.\\" The interview is reprinted in Milton Friedman, There’s No Such Thing as a Free Lunch. La Salle, IL: Open Court, 1975 and in: Milton Friedman, Bright Promises, Dismal Performance: An Economist’s Protest. (ed. William R. Allen). New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1983. A politician might for instance argue that, although his action seems unprincipled at first sight, when placed in a broader perspective it conforms exactly to what his constituency believes in. In an act of persuasion, he aims to convince people that his action is principled. Whether he is correct or not, may however be knowable only with the benefit of hindsight, long after the action occurred; the total effect of a strategic political decision may not be known until years or even decades after it was taken. When the outcome of an action is uncertain, a politician might argue, \\"History will prove me right.\\"A famous text by Fidel Castro is titled \\"History will absolve me\\". More recently, Tony Blair and George W. Bush defended the invasion of Iraq to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein stating that history would prove that this was the right thing to do. See: Roland Watson, \\"Bush echoes Blair with 'history will prove me right'\\", The Times (London), 31 July 2003. *Often the opportunist operates in a situation where there exist many unknowns, and where there is no broad agreement on how one should respond to the situation in a principled way.Jürgen Habermas accused Angela Merkel of opportunism in the following terms: \\"Since the Greek crisis erupted in May 2010 and Merkel's Christian Democrats lost the state election in North Rhine-Westphalia, she has subordinated each of her considered steps to the opportunism of staying in power.\\" Der Spiegel English edition, 9 August 2013. Far-sighted leadership is required, but in the absence of authoritative knowledge. In that case, whether behaviour is opportunist or not, may simply be very difficult to judge. A true opportunist is likely to utilize precisely this ambiguity to serve his purpose, capitalizing on human gullibility or ignorance. *Opportunistic behavior may occur in strategic alliances, in which one party uses the relationship to better its position, often at the expense of the other. In this case, one party puts its own interests ahead of the agreed goals of the alliance. *A political tendency that has been outmaneuvered or side-lined may latch on to any kind of opportunity to claw its way back to a position of power and influence. Conversely, a very powerful political group may use its power for opportunistic purposes because it knows that criticism of such action has no real effect (it is possible to \\"get away with it\\", i.e. the permissible). The role of principles The term \\"political opportunism\\" is often used in a pejorative sense, mainly because it connotes the abandonment of principles or compromising political goals.E.g. As'ad AbuKhalil, \\"Yusuf Al-Qaradawi and Political Opportunism\\". Al Alakhbar English, 28 March 2012. In that case, the original relationship between means and ends is lost. It may indeed be the case that means become ends in themselves, or that the ends become the means to achieve goals quite different from what was originally intended.E.g. Chris Arsenault, \\"Nicaragua's Ortega: Socialism to opportunism?\\". Al Jazeera English, 8 November 2011. Political principles can also be \\"diluted\\", reinterpreted or ignored, purely for the sake of promoting a contrived political unity. In consequence, a coherent rationale for being in the same organization is gradually lost; members may then drift away or the organization may decline, split or disintegrate. In politics, it is sometimes necessary to insist on political principles, while at other times it is necessary to insist on political unity among people who differ in their beliefs or principles. Some compromises usually have to be made. If political principles were typically defined or imposed in a completely inflexible, non- negotiable way, a likely result would be sectarianism or factionalism, since few people beyond \\"true believers\\" could support a political practice based on such rigid positions. *Normally, there must be at least some freedom in how political principles are formulated, interpreted, and actually applied; if there are too many rules and principles that people have to adhere to, the result would very likely be, that they simply cannot conform to those principles in practice, or that the bewildering complexity of rules can no longer guide behaviour. In that case, all kinds of errors are likely to occur. *Normally principles are therefore understood as a guide to behaviour that assumes both some freedom for individual judgment about how they are to be applied, as well as the responsibility to apply them. If one acts \\"in good faith\\", one assumes that relevant principles will be honored in practice, and if that faith is disappointed, that is because in practice the principles were not applied consistently or appropriately. How political principles are to be implemented is therefore usually open to some interpretation, and in part a personal responsibility. This creates the possibility that the same action is justifiable with reference to different principles, or that how a principle should be put into practice is interpreted in different ways. Just how \\"principled\\" an action is may therefore be open to dispute.Marc Tracy, \\"Congress cuts P.A. aid; 'political opportunism'\\". Tablet, 4 October 2011. Hence there is potential for deception in the way that principled behaviour, and deviation from it, is understood and justified. This becomes critically important in understanding opportunism insofar as it is a departure from principled behaviour. Assessment Labour Party for how they changed once they began getting some power in the British Government… Miss LIBERAL PARTY: \\"That rough person seems to think he knows you.\\" LABOUR STATESMAN \\"Oh, no doubt, m'lady, before one was a member of the governing classes one could know all sorts of queer people, but now, as you know, one has to be careful.\\" Political integrity typically demands an appropriate combination of principled positions and political flexibility that produces a morally consistent behavior in specific circumstances. Thus, whereas it may be necessary to seize a political opportunity when it presents itself, it should ideally be seized also with an appropriate motivation, and on a principled basis—which is basically what a leader of an increasingly large group aims to accomplish: to ensure that the right things are done for the right reasons. This ideal may be difficult to honor in practice, with the result that opportunistic mistakes are made. In his famous book Rules for Radicals,Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals. New York: Random House, 1971, p. 76. community organizer Saul Alinsky for instance comments that in political organizations, quite often the right things are done for the wrong reasons, and conversely that the wrong things are done for perfectly \\"correct\\" reasons – presumably because of differentials in the existing understandings about why something is actually being done, and what the real effect of it will be. If power is wielded by means of special knowledge others don't have access to, such differentials are obviously likely to persist. This is likely to be the case, insofar as confidentiality and secrecy are necessary in politics – if the wrong people get hold of vital information, this could have unfavourable political effects. Thus, people may know \\"part of the story\\" but not the \\"full story\\" because, for political reasons, it cannot be told. The corollary is that people imagine reasons for political action that differ from the real reasons. This can get in the way of a truly principled approach to politics. In fact, Alinsky claimed that: If \\"there is no such thing as an honest politician\\", this need not mean that all politicians are liars, but just that they are often not in a position to know or reveal the \\"complete picture\\" and thus express selected truths relevant to their actions, rather than all possible truths that could be told. In that sense, it is quite possible to be a \\"principled\\" politician – if that was not so, then (arguably) all politicians are opportunists. Yet if all politicians are opportunists—as many cynics believe—it becomes difficult to explain a politician's professional motivations . Namely, if their purpose is based only or primarily on self- interest—disregarding higher principles, which is the hallmark of opportunism—then politics is the least likely vocation, since it requires that politicians serve a collective interest or cause bigger than themselves. They would then be better off in a line of business where they can just pursue their own interest to the full. If they are able to be politicians, they could easily do so. The question is then why they don't, if indeed only out to serve themselves. The counter-argument to this interpretation is that politicians may start out in their career as hopeful idealists aiming to serve the community, but as soon as they become deeply entangled in political processes, they abandon their high ideals because they must reconcile many contradictory situations, and in the process begin to compromise themselves. Their political position, originally a means to a higher end, becomes an end in itself: a lifestyle. This counter-argument may have some validity, but has not proved that the suggested political evolution is inevitable in all cases. Namely, the politician owes power only to an ability to serve a greater cause, and the ability to represent people based on popular perceptions and trust. Therefore, the ability to serve exclusively according to self-interest is limited. At best, the counter-argument indicates that only the strongest characters can withstand the temptations of opportunist behaviour in politics, and maintain personal and political integrity. It may be not so much the politicians themselves who are opportunist, but rather their entourage: those who \\"climb on the political bandwagon\\" to profit from it for themselves. In this sense, John Keegan writes: Few actions are intrinsically opportunist; they are opportunist in a specific context, or from a specific point of view about means-ends relationships involved. This may make an objective approach to assessing the presence of opportunism quite difficult, because it may require a lot of \\"inside knowledge\\" about the relevant circumstances and about the motives involved. An objective, rational evaluation of whether a course of action is opportunist or not can only be stated in terms of whether the action and its motivation really did, or did not represent relevant principles (a consistency of means and ends); or whether it was motivated by self-interest or sectional interests rather than the common interest of the party (or parties) represented. Yet insofar as allegations of opportunism reflect a moral judgment, they may also contain a subjective interpretation, emotional preference or partisan viewpoint.David Brooks, \\"The upside of opportunism\\". New York Times, 29 October 2012, p. A27. Sources There are four main sources of political opportunism: *Suivisme: Some political analysts find the source of opportunism in a specific political methodology that is applied to maintain or increase political influence. An example might be so-called suivisme (a French word for political \\"tail-ending\\" or \\"tailism\\") where people try to follow and infiltrate any movement that shows signs of being popular or capturing significant support, for the purpose of gaining influence. Another version of this is sampling public opinions with surveys and focus groups to discover what they think, to contrive policies that are popular. This is usually not regarded as genuine leadership by politicians who know what they are doing, and who know what their constituency wants from personal experience. The opportunist tail-enders don't have any ideas themselves that lead to success, so they parasitize or plagiarize what others are doing in a bid to get a success. An extreme version of this is astroturfing. *Populism: this is often regarded as an intrinsically opportunist and unprincipled form of politics, catering to the \\"lowest common denominator\\". In that case, politicians advocate policies primarily on the basis that they think a lot of people will support them (and therefore useful to maintain or increase support), or that if a particular leader endorses policies, people will follow because they believe in the leader, even regardless of whether the policies are consistent with principles. *Risk management: some analysts see opportunism as originating in perceptions of the relative magnitudes of risk associated with different policy alternatives. Here, it is argued that the larger a political organization grows, and the more influence it has, the less likely it is, that it will pursue policies that could potentially result in the loss of the gains it has previously made. The bigger the political movement gets, the more is at stake. It would be more likely that an organization will compromise its principles to maintain its position than to continue pursuing its principles regardless of the consequences. Or, at the very least, the greater the political influence obtained, the more pressure exists to compromise one's political principlesSee Robert Michels, Political Parties. New York: Dover, 1959, chapter 3, and Ernest Mandel, \\"What is the bureaucracy?\\", in: Tariq Ali (ed.), The Stalinist Legacy. Harmondsworth: Pelican Books, 1984, p. 61-62). *Means become ends: a more general source of political opportunism is simply the great urge to achieve political success, to be successful, where success is defined as attaining a position of power, authority and influence (which in turn makes it possible to enact one's own policy). A politics is in truth successful only if the principles it advocates are really put into practice by a large number of people, or a majority of the people, in other words if people are really persuaded by an argument and act accordingly. In a principled politics, wielding power is only a means to this end: to restrain or change the behavioural patterns of citizens in ways thought to be beneficial to society. In opportunist politics, however, wielding power has become an end in itself, and the opportunist is the one who gains from it. Dilemmas To some extent, politics unavoidably involves dilemmas about whether to insist on one's own principles (and risk being isolated) or to adapt to a more widely held opinion for the sake of working together. People may be very unwilling to take risks and respond to opportunities, or they may take risks and opportunities without much regard for their overall significance. Accordingly, most political situations involve at least some potential for opportunism. Thus, there may not be any generally applicable rule or technique (a \\"philosopher's stone\\") that could be invoked in advance to prevent opportunism. At best, one could be aware of the possibility that opportunism could become a real problem, and take steps to minimize the risk. Generally, that risk is minimized if people ensure that they can always explain clearly the relationship between chosen means and ends vis-a-vis the basic principles that guide them, i.e. to understand exactly why they are doing things and what motivates them. Sometimes it is argued that opportunist errors are preferable to sectarian or factional errors. Whatever his \\"sins\\" may be interpreted to be, it is argued, the political opportunist prioritizes gaining or maintaining influence among people, and therefore at least remains among majority opinion or \\"among the masses\\". In contrast, the sectarian or factionalist is likely to uphold his principles or beliefs regardless of any experience that might contradict them, and regardless of how many people support them; he attaches supreme importance to espousing his principles with an exaggerated belief in the power of ideas, no matter what others believe. This leads to political isolation and permits little experiential verification of the validity of political ideas. Sectarianism and opportunism might however also combine, to the extent that a sect believes that almost any trick is permissible to attract more members to the sect. Since the majority could be quite wrong in regard to particular issues, however, adapting to that majority opinion on those issues might, in a specific context, be an even bigger error than \\"keeping one's principles pure\\". This is acknowledged in democratic theory to the extent that democracy is normally thought to involve the civil right of dissent from majority opinion, and consequently also the civil right of a minority viewpoint to exist. It implies that the majority could be wrong, and that the minority could be right, something that could never be corrected efficiently, if minority viewpoints were simply silenced. Because in that case, the minority might not be able to become a majority, even if experience proved the minority correct. That is why it is especially important to evaluate criticisms of \\"opportunism\\" in context. Drawbacks The tragedy of opportunist politics is often that, by forsaking principles to make political gains, it becomes difficult or impossible to distinguish and evaluate political success and failure appropriately, and draw appropriate conclusions. Because for such an evaluation, it must be possible to specify clearly to what extent it has been possible to realize the agreed principles being advocated (how far a political movement has progressed toward realizing its aims). If it is not even clear anymore what those principles are, a failure may be hailed as a success, or a success decried as a failure, giving rise to intense disputes about their real significance. It may create disorientation and confusion that, in turn, opportunists use to further their aims. If opportunist politics, in its urge for success, confuses what a political movement really stands for, or continually changes its story to suit the moment, any profound evaluation of its experiential record becomes impossible, and the past can be re-interpreted in any number of ways to suit the political purposes of the present or those of the future. In turn, that undermines the possibility of cumulative and collective learning from political experience in a truthful way. In that case, the errors and problems of the past are more likely to be repeated. Normally one would say that \\"if a course of action doesn't work, try something else\\", but if it is no longer even clear what worked and what didn't in the past, or they are mixed up with each other, current political activity may keep reproducing the problematic patterns and traditions, the essence of which the political actors are only dimly aware of. It becomes difficult or impossible to explain why a political policy was really opted for and followed, or what can justify it, or why what was done, was done. Political appraisals begin to look arbitrary, relativistic and subjective. And that promotes a growing discrepancy between the motives political actors said they had, and their real motives—which breeds cynicism, loss of purpose, lack of accountability, and the loss of the aspiration to work for political ideals. According to a popular saying, \\"there is no such thing as an honest politician\\" (politicians will accentuate certain truths at the expense of other truths), but there is such a thing as a \\"principled\\" politician working within clearly defined moral boundaries, which rule out doing \\"just anything\\". A politician may be a \\"clever talker\\" who can justify anything, but if there is a big discrepancy between the talk and what is actually being done, people are usually unlikely to believe it for very long. They know that things \\"do not match up\\", even if they do not know exactly why, and may become indifferent to whatever is being said. Continual political opportunism ultimately reduces the scope of politics to a visionless realpolitik or a barren pragmatism that may only function to maintain the status quo, and in which people deceive themselves about their own motivations and those of others. This makes life even more difficult for politicians, in their attempt to persuade people to work together for common goals. According to journalist Adam Nagourney, \\"Many Americans are more likely to assume that anyone they read or see on television has a political bias.\\"New York Times, 18 June 2010. Yet what that bias is, might not be obvious anymore. In 2009, a Pew Research Center survey found that only 29% of Americans believe that the media \\"gets the facts straight\\" and only 18% thought that media stories \\"deal fairly with all sides\\".\\"Press Accuracy Rating Hits Two Decade Low; Public Evaluations of the News Media: 1985-2009\\".

The practice of assembling coursepacks for students developed as a systematization of the practice of disseminating \\"handouts\\" for readings in class. This practice operated in parallel to the practice of libraries providing \\"reserves\\"—material pulled off shelves and \\"reserved\\" for use at the library, to ensure access for students in a class. Some teachers used coursepacks to supplement textbooks; others used them basically to create their own ad hoc textbooks. Over time, teachers began assembling their handouts at the beginning of the course, or having school administrators assemble them and charge students enough fees to recoup costs. As copy shops such as Kinko's became a thriving business in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they developed a market for making these coursepacks, offering different sorts of bindings, and so forth. Once the market became commercialized, licensing entities such as CCC (the \\"Copyright Clearance Center\\") in the United States became involved, negotiating licensing and \\"clearance\\" fees for use of materials in coursepacks. Materials that could not be licensed could not be included in coursepacks. Primarily as a result of escalating license fees, coursepacks have become a significant expense for students, along with textbooks.See generally, Zick Rubin, \\"Let's Spread the Word About Fair Use\\", Chronicle of Higher Education, Sept. 23, 2012. Coursepacks themselves operated primarily as an efficient service for providing print copies of material. As information has become increasingly available electronically, academic libraries have begun a transition to electronic reserves, making materials they have already acquired available for students registered in particular classes. Publishers, once critics of coursepack providers, have been critical of ereserves, arguing that libraries' provision of ereserves will supplant the commercial coursepack services.See Cambridge University Press v. Becker (S.D. Georgia 2012). Legal status  In the United States, the question of classroom handouts received significant attention in the lobbying and negotiation leading up to the 1976 Copyright Act. The statute as passed included a legislative codification of fair use at 17 U.S.C. 107 which specifically described handouts (\\"multiple copies for classroom use\\") as a fair use. > [T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in > copies ... for purposes such as ... teaching (including multiple copies for > classroom use) ... is not an infringement of copyright.\\"17 U.S.C. 107. However, the transition from classroom handouts to coursepacks led to a shift in how these materials were treated under US copyright law. In a series of \\"coursepack cases\\", US courts found that commercial services that profited from developing coursepacks were not protected by fair use. See Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services (1996), Basic Books v. Kinko's Graphics (1991); 1982 litigation against New York University.\\"Copyright scenarios: Coursepacks\\" , TheCopyrightSite.org (last visited May 7, 2013).

Instead of, or in addition to, Matador Automatic Radar Control, the last Matador variant (TM-61C) added SHANICLE passive radio guidance. Mid-course guidance MARC guided the Matador to the dive point (or to the \\"SHANICLE hyperbolic zone\\") by a directional control signal to the Matador \\"spoilers\\" for momentarily deflecting wing airflow to slightly redirect the course of the missile. The OA-626 computed both the missile's course and the direction of the desired destination from the missile position, and the MARC repeated spoiler signals to reduce the difference. For MARC-commanded dives, an initial point was used as a preliminary destination to ensure the Matador subsequently had the necessary general direction of flight for the dive toward the target. During the final cruise prior to the dive, MARC continually predicted the dive point based on any variations of missile velocity measured by the MPS-19—as well as the corresponding nominal time and displacement expected during the upcoming dive When the Matador was acceptably near the \\"point predicted by the MARC\\", the dump command was initiated and the missile was self-controlled during the \\"semi-ballistic transonic dive\\" with zero lift to the detonation point near the target.

It contains two species, B. parvidens and B. pigotti. Brochuchus belongs to the subfamily Crocodylinae, which includes all living crocodiles. The closest living relative of Brochuchus is Osteolaemus, the dwarf crocodile. Compared to Osteolaemus, which has a small body and blunt snout, Brochuchus has a more generalized crocodylid anatomy. Brochuchus is characterized by a flat and relatively narrow skull, and although it is larger than Osteolaemus it is smaller than most other crocodylids. It has two prominent bumps on the surface of its snout. The genus was named in honor of Christopher A. Brochu, for his scientific work on Crocodylia and its relatives. The unusual combination and spelling are intended as an auditory and visual pun such that the ‘ch’ sound in Brochu takes the place of the ‘s’ sound in ‘suchus.’ combined with ‘souchus’ (Greek for crocodile), which is a common suffix for crocodylomorph genera. Phylogeny A phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 found that Brochuchus was a close relative of Osteolaemus. Brochuchus and Osteolaemus are part of a clade within Crocodylidae informally called \\"osteolaemins\\". They are closely related to the genus Crocodylus, which includes most living crocodiles. Osteolaemins are among the most diverse groups within Crocodylidae, including the small-bodied and short-snouted Osteolaemus, the generalized and longer-snouted Brochuchus, the moderate-sized and horned Voay, and the very large-bodied Rimasuchus. Within osteolaemins, Brochuchus is most closely related to KNM-LT 24081, an unnamed species from Lothagam in Tanzania, and to Rimasuchus. Until recently another crocodylid from the Miocene and Pliocene of Africa called Euthecodon was thought to be closely related to Osteolaemus, Voay, and Rimasuchus, and together they were grouped in a clade called Osteolaeminae. Recent phylogenetic analyses, including the 2013 analysis with Brochuchus, place Euthecodon as a closer relative of the living Mecistops or slender-snouted crocodile. Together these two genera belong to a clade informally called \\"mecistopins\\" and are more closely related to the Crocodylus clade than are osteolaemins. Paleobiology Brochuchus has a generalized crocodylid body form with a long, narrow snout and a robust skeleton. Like most other species within Crocodylidae, Brochuchus was probably predatory and likely spent much of its time in water. As shown by the many mammal fossils that have been found on Rusinga Island, Brochuchus lived alongside several species of proboscideans (elephant relatives) and primates, the most famous of which is the early ape Proconsul. Although there is no direct evidence for what Brochuchus ate, it may have preyed on Proconsul. If this is the case, Brochuchus may have been one of the earliest anthropoidophagous (\\"ape-eating\\") crocodilians.

León received a graduate degree in visual arts from the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) in Havana, while also graduating from the Academy of Media Arts Cologne in Cologne, Germany in 2007. She is noted for her body of work spanning drawing to video art, including installation, objects, and photography. León is \\"interested in interstices between visible and invisible, between sound and silence, between ephemeral and eternal.\\"http://www.glendaleon.com/ She is currently based in Havana and Madrid. Her internationally acclaimed work has received prizes such as The Pollock-Krasner Foundation Award and residencies like Couvent des Recollets, in Paris and Fonderie Darling, in Montreal. Her works belong to the permanent collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana, and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, USA.  History  León began her Visual Art studies at 12 years old and started showing at a professional level in the year 1999. She also studied Classical Ballet and Philology at the University of Havana, where she got a BA in Art History. From the very beginning her work appeared new for the Cuban art context because of her peculiar approach to conceptualism. The use of natural and artificial flowers, texts, sound and materials like hair and chewing gum were part of her first works. For example, her work titled \\"Chewed Line from Chewed Ideas series\\" is a photograph of a piece of gum stretched over a wide distance, creating the effect of abstracting the object. León has exhibited in the Havana and Venice biennials since 2012. Some of her best known installations are Interpreted World, Lost Time and the videos Inversion, Every Breath and Destiny. Her work has been published and reviewed by different art magazines and newspapers such as Bomb Magazine, ArtNexus, ArtForum, ArteCubano among others. A recurring theme in Léon's work is the juxtaposition of the natural and the artificial. In 2004, Léon conducted a large-scale outdoor installation in Montréal, entitled \\"Esperanza (Out of Season)\\", in which she adhered fake branches and leaves to the trees in a public park - a work that only became visible with the passing of the season, as the trees' leaves slowly and naturally dropped away, revealing the imitation branches in stark contrast. Léon reprised this project for Site Santa Fe's 2014 Biennial of the Americas, \\"Unsettled Landscapes.\\" Many of Léon's works concern the aesthetics of sound, working with \\"the space where sound and the visual merge,\\" as she describes it. Her 2012 solo exhibition at Magnan Metz in New York, Listening to Silence, focused on the relationship between the visual world and musical compositions, in a series of works made by superimposing empty musical scores over photographs of nature, suggesting that the visual patterns found in the world - the arrangement of birds in the sky, drops of rain on a sheet of glass, the result of a game of dice - could be \\"played\\" like music. In 2013, she produced a major solo exhibition at the Château des Adhémar, in Montélimar, France, where she exhibited various works on paper, sculptures, and installations, including \\"Wasted Time,\\" a large pile of sand with an hourglass at the top, representing lost time. In 2013 she took part in the Cuban Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennial, where she showed a project entitled Music of the Spheres, a spherical glass music box suspended from the ceiling that played a 30-second, looped composition whose musical notes relate to the position of the planets in the solar system on a given day.

He changed the way leprosy was perceived, classified different types of leprosy patients, and made important contributions to both syphilis and a disease called pinta. Life Latapí was born to Fernando Latapí Rangel and Pilar Contreras Scheleski, baptized on November 4, 1902. His father was the owner of two toy shops “El Coliseo” and “El Globo” in Mexico City. His grandfather was born in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques in the south of France, and his mother’s family came from Tlacotalpan, Veracruz. Latapí look after his mother in appearance. He had two brothers, Victor and Alberto and a sister, Pilar. His first house was in Colonia Santa María la Ribera, Mexico City, a residential neighborhood. He was religious and attended church every Sunday. As a child he was polite and kind-hearted. He loved flowers and always took special care for his dog, named “Tu Tu”. He attended elementary school at Instituto Franco Inglés, and then went to the Nacional Preparatoria de la Universidad Nacional, where he studied medicine. After graduating from medical school in August 11, 1928, he was not originally interested in pursuing a career in dermatology. However, as it was the only vacant position at a local clinic, he started working in the field. In 1934, he married his first wife, Esperanza Nieto, mentioned in his thesis as “the one who came to light up my life”. Esperanza died in 1937 giving birth to a baby, which also died during childbirth. This event was caused by the use of forceps, which caused excessive bleeding. Four years later, Latapi married Clemencia Espinoza, which he met at a leprosy campaign. Clemencia remained Latapi’s partner and collaborator throughout the years until Fernando’s death in 1989. Although his wife and he loved children, they never had one on their own. Apart from his native language Spanish, he spoke French and English, and understood both Italian and Portuguese. The latter was especially useful when he worked in leprosy studies with physicians João Ramos e Silva from Brazil and Augusto Salazar Leite from Portugal. He enjoyed reading plays and listening to opera and classical music. He was also fond of theatre, but most of all, he liked going to the cinema, and during a long period of time he annually attended a film festival called “Muestra Internacional de Cine”. Career Latapí was one of the main founders and remained director of the Mexican Society of Dermatology for 45 years, until his death in 1982. When the Mexican Association of Action Against Leprosy (AMAL abbr. in Spanish) was founded in 1948, Fernando Latapí donated a few books and promoted the establishment of a library. Other books were added slowly and then Dr. Maximiliamo Obermayer, a Californian professor in dermatology donated his library. Today, with the contribution of important figures in dermatology as well as with books from the Mexican government, AMAL has one of the largest libraries in dermatology and leprology in Mexico. On January 8, 1937, Fernando Latapí founded the Mexican School of Leprology that has as main goals the abolishment of drastic laws against people with leprosy, as well as the integral and respectful treatment towards them. Dr. Latapí contributed to the eradication of the traditional concept of leprosy, in which people that suffered from this condition were social misfits since people considered them impure and they thought leprosy was highly contagious. To change this misconception, he and his team crusaded for the training of medical personal in the disease. Later on, he and his team created brigades which diagnosed more than seven thousand patients in three years which was more people than what had been diagnosed in thirty years prior. At AMAL, he always promoted equal treatment for all patients, and he successfully treated most of them, giving a revolutionary twist to the history of this disease that had no cure before. He also demonstrated that chaulmoogra oil, which at the time was thought to be an efficient treatment, was actually not beneficial, but harmful to the treatment of the disease. Instead, in 1944 he was the first one to use promin, as a treatment for leprosy in Mexico. He also made significant contributions for a disease called pinta, specifically about its diagnosis with early buds. The AMAL Center of Leprosy served as a hospital for all cases of leprosy and some years later became a dermatological center, which is now Ladislao De La Pascua Dermatological Center. The Center was founded by Dr. Latapí and strongly contributes to the role of teaching and qualification of personal in the Mexican dermatological area since successful specialists have studied there and have developed futures institutions based on the teachings of their alma mater. Due to his contributions during his career, he received national and international recognition. In 1956 he organized the 3rd Ibero Latin-American Congress of dermatology as well as the 11th edition of the same one In 1960, he received the Gaspar Viana of CILAD, the highest award in the Mexican medicine. In 1978 he organized the XI International Congress of Leprosy. He also received the Damián Dutton award for his contributions in the field of leprology in 1978. He served as the president of the XI International Congress of Leprosy celebrated in Mexico in 1978 as well. Fernando Latapí was the author of over three hundred papers along his career. Leprosy became his passion for 45 years, and the source behind his major medical contributions. He published a great deal of writings in medical magazines and journals. One of Latapí’s passions was teaching, something he did for many years. He taught his students about health service, interaction with patients, kindness as well as academic content. He stated that someone giving a class or talking to a patient should guarantee that the listener laughed, or cried because it indicated trust in the doctor. He made contributions to medicine such as being the first one to employ successfully sulphones for treatment of mycetomas and the proposal of the term “pintides” for the secondary lesions of pinta. He also discovered a previously unknown disease in 1956, calling it “dyschromia en confetti” which is caused by hydroquinones. Dr. Latapí also established terms such as “early” and “late” syphilis and corticoderma. He modified the Morgan scheme in syphilis and rediscovered necrotizing erythema that is also known as Lucio phenomenon. There is even a “Latapi Lepromatosis” which is a form of diffuse nonnodular lepromatous leprosy.

She was completed in 1930 and provided a trans-Pacific service between the US and the Far East. In 1937 she ran aground on an island off Formosa (now known as Taiwan) during a typhoon and was declared a total loss. She had a sister ship, , that was completed in 1931, was made a troopship in 1941 and was lost after striking a mine while attempting to enter the harbor at Espiritu Santo in 1942. Building Dollar Lines ordered both the President Hoover and President Coolidge on 26 October 1929. The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia, USA built the two ships, completing the Hoover in 1930 and Coolidge in 1931. They were the largest merchant ships built in the USA up to that time. First Lady Lou Henry Hoover launched and christened President Hoover on December 9, 1930. Each ship had turbo-electric transmission, with a pair of steam turbo generators generating current that powered propulsion motors on the twin propeller shafts. Westinghouse built the turbo generators and propulsion motors for President Coolidge but General Electric built the turbo generators and propulsion motors for President Hoover. 12 oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox high- pressure boilers supplied the steam for President Hoovers turbo-generators. The electric propulsion motors produced 26,500 shp at 133 RPM. President Hoovers accommodation was air conditioned and there was a 'phone in every cabin. There were swimming pools on deck, gymnasiums, a dance floor and Otis elevators. Décor was in contemporary Art Deco style and the First Class lounge was decorated with murals by the artist Frank Bergman of New York. Robert Dollar had bought his first ship in 1895, founded Dollar Lines in 1903 and was now 87 years old. On August 6, 1931, three days before President Hoover was launched, he toured her and declared \\"This ship is a wonder\\". Dollar lived until May 1932, just a few months after President Hoover and President Coolidge made their maiden voyages. Trans-Pacific service President Hoover and President Coolidge ran between San Francisco and Manila via Japan and China. The United States Postal Service subsidised them to carry mail, which helped Dollar to run the two ships at a profit. However, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931–32, the Japanese attack on the Great Wall in 1933 and the Japanese invasion of China starting in July 1937 all deterred US travel to the Far East, and Dollar Lines became increasingly unprofitable. Bombed in the Yangtze River After the Battle of Shanghai had broken out in August 1937, President Hoover was diverted from Hong Kong to evacuate US nationals from Shanghai. On 30 August the liner was moored in the Yangtze River, awaiting clearance to enter the Wusong River to reach the Port of Shanghai when, despite a -long US flag draped on her top deck abaft the bridge to identify her to aircraft as a neutral US ship, the Republic of China Air Force mistook her for the Japanese troopship Asama Maru and bombed her. One bomb hit President Hoovers top deck, killing a crewman from the mess hall. Fragments from another bomb penetrated the main saloon, wounding six crew and two passengers. One of President Hoovers radio officers transmitted a distress call stating that Chinese aircraft were attacking her. Both an IJN destroyer and a Royal Navy cruiser came in response, but in the event only medical help was needed. Despite her casualties President Hoover sustained only minor damage, but she aborted the rescue mission to Shanghai and returned to San Francisco for repairs. Chiang Kai-shek, leader of China's National Military Commission, had known Robert Dollar and was reportedly furious that his aircraft had attacked his late friend's ship. He threatened to have the officer responsible executed until he found that it was his chief air force advisor Claire Lee Chennault. Chiang's wife Soong Mei-ling had hired Chennault only two months previously, and the Generalissimo relented and instead paid the Texan a $10,000 bonus soon afterwards. Aground on Kasho-to After repairs President Hoover returned to service, departing from San Francisco on 22 November 1937 for Kobe and Manila. She was barely more than half-full, with only 503 passengers. During the voyage the Dollar Lines management signaled President Hoovers Master, George W Yardley, \\"You must be in Manila, absolutely urgent that you arrive not later than 6 a.m. 12th December, make all possible speed\\". President Hoovers course from Kobe to Manila avoided Hong Kong, Shanghai and the Taiwan Strait in order to keep clear of the Sino-Japanese War zone. Instead President Hoover took an unfamiliar course down the east coast of Taiwan, which since 1895 had been under Japanese rule. The Japanese colonial authorities had turned off the lighthouses in Taiwan so Hoover navigated by dead reckoning. A strong monsoon blowing from the northeast made it difficult to calculate her course accurately, and a heavy mist made visibility extremely poor. At about 0100 hrs on 11 December (local date) President Hoover struck a reef about from the shore of Zhongliao Bay on the north coast of Kasho-to (綠島), a volcanic island about off Taitung City in south-eastern Taiwan. Her bottom was torn open as far aft as her engine room and she came to rest with a slight list to port. At about 0200 hrs President Hoover fired distress flares and her radio officer sent an SOS signal. The Hamburg America Line cargo ship D/S Preußen received the SOS and arrived around dawn, but the heavy sea and shallow water prevented her from approaching close enough to help. Captain Yardley tried at first to refloat the ship by having the crew jettison cargo and bunker oil overboard. Thick black fuel oil spread over the sea and onto the beach, either deliberately discharged or through the reef damaging the ship's bunkers. But as the monsoon continued to blow from the northeast, and lightening President Hoover only helped the wind and strong waves to drive her further onto the reef until she was only from shore. A junior member of the Purser's department, Eugene Lukes, recalled: > ... the general alarms went off, and we were getting all the passengers out, > getting everybody up on deck. It was blowing, the seas were starting to > smack against the side of the ship, it was pitch black. And pretty soon we > could see little bobbing lights along the shoreline, little oil lanterns so > we obviously stirred up the natives. As it got lighter we could see that we > had ripped out the bottom almost clear back to the engine room. There was a > lot of oil, and it oiled the sea and the beach. There was no backing off, so > we had to get the passengers ashore. We lowered the lifeboats with people in > them. Some of the villagers of Zhongliao fled to the mountains because at the sight of President Hoover close to shore, and the sound and sight of her distress flares, they feared that the Sino-Japanese fighting had reached their island. With the dawn, villagers realised what had really happened, and put to sea in motor fishing boats to help. Abandoning the ship President Hoovers crew prepared to evacuate passengers. In order to keep boats on course between the ship and the shore in the monsoon wind, they put a wire cable ashore and tautened it with a winch aboard ship. In each boat two crewmen wearing strong gloves, one each in the bow and the stern, would slide their hands along the cable to guide boats from ship to shore. Some passengers alleged that President Hoovers crew were inexperienced, and that when trying to get the wire cable ashore to prepare for the evacuation they capsized two of the lifeboats in shallow water. The helped to transfer survivors from Kasho-to to President McKinley and President Pierce At low tide around 1300 hrs Yardley ordered the evacuation of the passengers. President Hoovers crew lowered her lifeboats, villagers approached with their boats and both ferried passengers ashore. It took about 15 minutes for a boat to make each trip along the cable from ship to shore. Because of the black oil on the water, some of the women passengers were reluctant to step from the lifeboats to wade ashore, so crewmen carried them. At about 1500 hrs the flagship of the Japanese 4th Fleet, the arrived with an unidentified to observe and protect President Hoover. It took 36 hours from the line being secured to the last passenger being brought ashore. No lives were lost, but some passengers suffered hypothermia in the December wind and cold and were treated by the ship's doctor. From where they landed the survivors had to walk about to Zhongliao village. There as many as possible were accommodated in the village school, with the remainder being distributed to villagers' houses. According to Time, while the passengers were being taken ashore a small number of the crewmen aboard President Hoover plundered the ship's liquor supply. > According to Dr. Claude Conrad, a missionary official of Washington, D. C.: > \\"A majority of the ship's crew came into camp more or less incapacitated and > abusive from the effects of free indulgence in the ship's liquor stores. Out > of control of officers partially in the same condition, many of the crew men > continued most of the night terrorizing passengers and natives.\\" However, > when the liquored seamen began hunting for women passengers sleeping in > scattered houses ashore, some officers and other passengers formed a > vigilante group to protect them. There was no actual molestation. There > would have been no disturbance at all ashore, said some of the passengers, > if the Hoover's officers had been permitted by Japanese police to land with > their guns. Other witnesses reported that some of the passengers also got drunk. Repatriation from Kasho-to Dollar Lines' President Pierce repatriated President Hoovers officers, steerage passengers and 100 of her crew. The US Navy had sent two s to help: from Manila and from Olongapo Naval Station. However, in the heavy sea they made only and did not arrive until 1245 hrs the next day, 12 December. A Japanese officer from Ashigara boarded Alden and cleared the two US warships to enter Japanese territorial waters. Alden sent a party of two officers and 15 enlisted men aboard President Hoover to secure her specie vault, whose contents included registered mail and other valuables, and both destroyers sent landing parties ashore to restore order among the survivors. On 12 December at about 1500 hrs a Japanese cargo ship, Toriyama Maru, arrived to deliver food and other necessities to the survivors. On 13 December American Mail Line's President McKinley arrived offshore. On the morning of 14 December news reached Alden and Barker that two days earlier Japanese aircraft had sunk the US gunboat USS Panay in the Yangtze River near Nanjing. Alden and Barker discreetly prepared racks of ammunition for their 4\\"/50 caliber guns, but the IJN ships continued to stand by and assist. President McKinley moved closer inshore and embarked about 400 of President Hoovers passengers and about 230 of her crew. Japanese Navy flat-bottomed boats brought them from the shore out to meet President McKinleys boats and a motor launch, which then ferried them out to the liner. President McKinley then left for Manila, leaving behind President Hoovers officers, steerage passengers and the last 100 of her crew on Kasho-to. On 15 December Dollar Lines' President Pierce arrived and rescued President Hoovers steerage passengers, officers and remainder of her crew. USS Alden remained guarding the wreck until 23 December, when the Japanese authorities took over. Aftermath Lyudao Lighthouse on Green Island Many failed attempts were made to rescue the ship. In February 1938 President McKinley returned, bringing Chinese laborers and Dollar Lines personnel who carried out some salvage and recovery work. Dollar Lines surveyed the ship and concluded that she would be a constructive total loss. Dollar Lines stripped what it could from the wreck and then sold her for $500,000 to the Kitagawa Ship Salvage Company, It took the Japanese salvagers the next three years to break up the wreck. By then Dollar Steamship Lines as a company had ceased to exist. In June 1938 President Hoovers sister ship President Coolidge was arrested for an unpaid debt of $35,000, and in August 1938 the United States Maritime Commission intervened by reorganising the company as American President Lines. Members of the US public gave money to the American Red Cross for a lighthouse to be built near Zhongliao village on Kasho-to (now called Green Island). Lyudao Lighthouse was designed by Japanese engineers, built by local islanders in 1938 and is high.

In its beginning, it has setup an unauthorized transient camp on private property in October, 2011 in Old Town Chinatown at Northwest 4th Avenue and West Burnside Street near downtown, Portland. It had permission from the property owner, but it was not authorized by the city. The encampment operates under its parent company Right 2 Survive. Its operation erected tents and built a fence without necessary permits and it was assessed fines for doing so. In April 2017, the city agreed to allow its organized transient camp to move to a land owned by the Portland Bureau of Transportation and stay for up to two years. Its camp remained at the original location for over five years before moving to a temporary site in North Portland on N Thunderbird Way in July 2017. It was reported in August 2020 that the lease at this site has been extended until April 2021. Operations  alt= Right 2 Dream Too's former location at NW 4th and Burnside Street entrance to Old Town Chinatown where they remained until July 2017 Code of conduct reads drug and weapon free zone as cited by Oregon Public Broadcasting in February 2016. There is a general area and a member area. Full time lodging and tiny homes are for member benefit only. Membership is restricted and it is subject to several rounds of approval process by existing members. Non-members sleep on the floor and are restricted to 12 hours per 24 hour period, as of June 2017. The camp is self managed and has a 24-hour security desk staffed by camp residents at its entrance. While monetary contribution is not required of occupants, contribution towards the operation of the encampment is expected. Portland Tribune reported in August 2020 that about 100 people utilize the encampment every 24 hours, but R2D2 does not collect or maintain any information on the overnight guests. Location  The encampment began at the original location in 2011. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association objected to its presence next to the Chinatown Gate. In addition, the Portland Business Alliance sent a letter to city officials asking for removal or relocation of Right 2 Dream Too around December 2012. In 2013, the encampment and Portland city officials developed tentative plans to move the homeless camp to a city-owned parking lot under the Broadway Bridge in Portland's Pearl District. Additional locations for the camp's relocation have also been considered by the organization and city officials. Business and neighborhood leaders in the Pearl District have fought in opposition against the proposed Pearl District move. Complaints about its transient campsite to the city's Bureau of Development Services dried up and dropped to just one in a 12 months period by February 2015. Commissioner Dan Saltzman gave his opinion that \\"People that are concerned about their presence have given up,\\" \\"They've given up on us [city leaders]. I think that has a lot to do with it.\\" In 2015, the city considered moving the encampment to a lot next to a metal finishing business that has been in business at the same location for 72 years and has been using the lot in question with permission for a long period. The proposal was blocked by a state land use board and the move did not materialize. The long standing metal finishing business sued the city for $9.9 million in 2018 alleging breach of agreement over the ordeal. This dispute was unresolved as of August 2020. A warehouse in Northwest Portland and a location in the industrial area of the central east side were considered as well, but did not materialize due to cost and neighborhood oppositions. In the site selection process, a developer pledged $800,000 to keep the campsite out of the Pearl District.

There exists no agreed general, scientific definition or theory of economic opportunism; the literature usually considers only specific cases and contexts. Description There is no agreement about why this is so. Oliver E. Williamson comments: Market trade supplies no universal morality of its own, except the law of contract and basic practical requirements to settle transactions, while at the same time legal rules, however precise in their formulation, cannot control every last detail of transactions and the interpretation (or implications) thereof. Since economic opportunism must be assessed against some relevant norm or principle, controversy about what that norm or principle should be, makes a general definition difficult.Chao C. Chen, Mike W. Peng, Patrick A. Saparito, \\"Individualism, Collectivism, and Opportunism: A Cultural Perspective on Transaction Cost Economics\\". In: Journal of Management, Vol. 28 No. 4, 2002, pp. 567–583. *Economists frequently cannot even agree on the basic principles of the functioning of economic life, and consequently what constitutes a deviation from those principles is in dispute.Lex Donaldson, American anti-management theories of organization: a critique of paradigm proliferation. Cambridge University Press, 1995. *Market trade is compatible with a great variety of moral norms, religions and political systems, and indeed supporters of the free market claim that this is exactly its advantage: people can choose their own values, buying and selling as they wish within a basic legal framework accepted by all.Thomas C. Leonard, \\"The price is wrong: causes and consequences of ethical restraint in trade.\\" Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines, Volume 14, numéro 4, Décembre 2004, pp 1–17. *Economic action therefore involves a great variety of motives, some more honorable than others. *It is not feasible to outlaw many forms of economic opportunism, because any such law could not be effectively enforced, or, such laws would conflict with the civil rights or trading rights of citizens. People often complain about \\"over-regulation\\" or \\"too many rules\\" – too much \\"policing\\" may mean that they no longer take economic initiatives (or become confused about what rule to follow).\\"...mainstream economics has become obsessed with the ‘irresponsibility’ of opportunistic politicians who cater to an economically uneducated electorate by interfering with otherwise efficient markets, in pursuit of objectives — such as full employment and social justice — that truly free markets would in the long run deliver anyway, but must fail to deliver when distorted by politics\\". – Wolfgang Streeck, \\"The crises of democratic capitalism\\". New Left Review 71, September–October 2011. *It is often disputed in economics whether the opportunist, as a type of \\"entrepreneur\\", creates more opportunities for everybody by what he does, or whether the opportunist is a \\"pest\\" with a harmful effect on economic life. Evaluating this objectively can be extraordinarily difficult, because people may not even agree about what the true costs and benefits are. Adam Smith famously wrote in The Wealth of Nations that: If that Smithian view is accepted, then it is difficult to establish that \\"taking selfish advantage of an economic situation\\" can in any way be considered \\"opportunist\\", because it does not transgress any moral principle or principle of trade. Indeed, the pursuit of self-interest is in this view beneficial for all, it is exactly what makes the market tick. Furthermore, it is in the interest of market actors to conduct their affairs properly, because if their trading reputation is destroyed, they will be out of business. If it is believed that markets gravitate spontaneously to an equilibrium state, so that price-levels ensure that everybody gets what they want, how can there be any \\"opportunism\\"?See: Charles W. L. Hill, \\"Cooperation, Opportunism and the Invisible Hand: Implications for transaction cost theory\\", in: Academy of Management Review, Vol. 15 No. 3, 1990, p. 500-513). At best one could draw a subtle distinction between \\"selfishness\\" and \\"self-interest\\". For example, \\"self-interest\\" could be defined as a healthy concern with one's own wellbeing, necessary to survive and prosper, while \\"selfishness\\" could be defined as an exclusive or excessive concern with one's own advantage while disregarding the interests of others. Any trading relationship usually involves both cooperation between the trading partners, so that each gets what they want from others, and competition by each party to get the best deal for themselves. So the trading relationship is normally both self-directed and other-directed at the same time. The issue then is, just how far the concerns of other party or parties to the trade are really taken into account, or to what extent the expectations of others are fully met or honoured. \\"Selfishness\\" would then denote a specific type of self-interest which violates a shared principle of trade (or some other principle) in a way that is illegitimate, unfair, unjust in some sense (such as unfair trade, negligence or unfair competition). Adam Smith does not rule out that possibility, acknowledging implicitly that the self-interest and the interest of society may not always be compatible, only \\"frequently\\". Opportunism could then be thought of as an aberration, a \\"market imperfection\\" or a \\"grey area\\" that sometimes occurs in normal trading activity. People would not normally trade, if they did not expect to gain something by it; the fact that they do trade, rather than simply rob each other, normally presupposes at least a respect for the basic rights of the party being traded with. Nevertheless, the gains or benefits of trading activity (and indeed the losses), although entirely legal, might be distributed very unequally or in ways not anticipated by previous understandings, and thus accusations of \\"economic opportunism\\" can arise nevertheless in many different settings.Kurt Eggert, \\"Limiting abuse and opportunism by mortgage servicers\\". In: Housing Policy Debate (Fannie Mae Foundation), Vol. 15, Issue 3, 2004. The entitlement to make some economic gains is then considered to be illegitimate, in some way. If this is the case, relevant trading obligations (or civil obligations) are usually considered as not being (fully) met or honored, in the pursuit of economic self-interest. Greed is frequently mentioned as a primary motive for economic opportunism.Damian Saunders, \\"Mark Hurd and HP, economic opportunism and greed, one year on.\\" Opinion, 30 January 2010. Dan Ackman, \\"Kozlowski Speaks!\\". Forbes Magazine, 28 April 2005. Ken Frost, \\"The Ongoing Trials of The Late Michael Jackson: Greed and Opportunism.\\" 2 February 2005. Even so, people might just try to get the most out of a situation for themselves with the least effort they can get away with, disregarding the interests of others who also have a stake in the situation (see stakeholder). An editor of the Financial Times, Martin Wolf, remarked famously about the financial sector that \\"No [other] industry has a comparable talent for privatising gains and socialising losses.\\"Martin Wolf, \\"Regulators should intervene in bankers’ pay\\". In: Financial Times (London), 16 January 2008. Some years later, he explained that \\"Today’s banks represent the incarnation of profit-seeking behaviour taken to its logical limits, in which the only question asked by senior staff is not what is their duty or their responsibility, but what can they get away with.\\"Martin Wolf, \\"Banking reforms after the Libor scandal.\\" Financial Times, 2 July 2012. What exactly the rightful or correct obligations of trading parties are to each other, can be open to interpretation \\"in good faith\\" (bona fide) by those trading parties or other parties. It may depend on the \\"understanding\\" that exists in a business situation.Mitchel Abolafia, Making markets: opportunism and restraint on Wall Street. Harvard University Press, 2001. This creates the possibility that, even although – strictly speaking, or formally – everything is done \\"within the law\\", economic actors nevertheless do not (or not fully) honour their trading obligations in some way, for selfish motives, and therefore commit what amounts to deceit, trickery or cheating, by utilizing a somewhat different \\"interpretation\\", \\"intention\\", \\"expectation\\" or \\"understanding\\". Therefore, there is always much controversy about what these obligations really are, in the fine detail – it may be that \\"one man's opportunism is another man's opportunity\\". At issue here is, what one might legitimately expect a trading party to understand or comply with in a business deal, i.e. how the meaning of it is construed, which can differ between trading parties with a different stake or interest in the deal, and might itself change in the course of negotiations.See e.g. Ravi S. Achrol and Gregory T. Gundlach, \\"Legal and social safeguards against opportunism in exchange.\\" Journal of Retailing, Volume 75, Issue 1, Spring 1999, Pages 107–124. Whether a trading activity is viewed as \\"opportunist\\" might just depend on one's moral viewpoint or informal expectation, because \\"there is no law against it\\". For this reason, institutional economics often evaluates economic opportunism in relation to those norms of acceptable human conduct that, though not necessarily stated in laws, are nevertheless implied by legislation or by jurisprudence. Glenn R. ParkerIn his book Self-policing in politics: the political economy of reputational controls on politicians (Princeton University Press, 2004, p.21). claims that the five most discussed examples of economic opportunism are: *adverse selection *moral hazard *last-period exploitation, when it is known that competitors or stakeholders are not able to respond to a suitably timed selfish action. *reneging (in contracts), where a contractual agreement, promise, intention or understanding of a deal is not fully honoured by a party to the contract, for selfish motives, because it is possible \\"to get away with it\\" and/or because there is an incentive to do so.See e.g. G. Richard Shell, \\"Opportunism and trust in the Negotiation of Commercial Contracts: Toward a New Cause of Action.\\" Vanderbilt Law Review, Vol. 44, March 1991, pp. 221–282. *shirking, involving some kind of negligence, or failure to acquit oneself of a duty (or a responsibility) previous agreed or implied (see also efficiency wages). In transaction cost economics, opportunism means self-interest seeking with guile, involving some kind of deliberate deceit and the absence of moral restraint. It could involve deliberately withholding or distorting important business information, shirking (doing less work than agreed), or failing to fulfill formal or informal promises and obligations. It occurs in trading activities especially where rules and sanctions are lacking, and where the opportunist actor has great power to influence an outcome by the attitude he assumes in practice. However, othersNicolai J. Foss and Peter G. Klein, \\"Critiques of transaction cost economics: An overview\\". Organizations and markets, September 2009 argue that this reflects a narrow view of economic opportunism, because there are many more ways that economic actors can take selfish advantage of other economic actors, even if they do not violate the law.See further Kuntara Pukthuanthong and Harry J. Turtle, \\"Legal Opportunism, Litigation Risk, and IPO Underpricing\\", January 2009 ; Paul J. Zak (ed.), Moral markets: the critical role of values in the economy. Princeton University Press, 2008). For example, managers can tilt the details of financial reporting in such a way that it favours their own position.Lan Sun and Subhrendu Rath, \\"Fundamental Determinants, Opportunistic Behavior and Signaling Mechanism: An Integration of Earnings Management Perspectives.\\" International Review of Business Research Papers Vol. 4, No. 4, Aug–Sept. 2008, Pp. 406–420.

It was contracted by the US Army Air Force in March 1946 with the University of Michigan's Aeronautical Research Center (MARC). A similar effort, Project Thumper, started at General Electric. Early results demonstrated that the task of shooting down missiles appeared to be beyond the state of the art, and both projects were downgraded to long-term technology studies in the summer of 1947. They moved to the US Air Force with that force's creation in fall 1947. Due to budget constraints, Thumper was cancelled in 1949 and its funds re-directed to the GAPA project. Partially due to the perceived threat of Soviet long-range bombers being more serious, and that the systems still appeared to be beyond the state of the art, the Air Force later cancelled Wizard as well. Funds from the Wizard, Thumper and GAPA concepts were all channeled into MX-606, a long-range surface-to-air missile project that eventually emerged in the late 1950s as the CIM-10 Bomarc. In 1955 the Army announced its intention to develop a new anti-ICBM system based on its Nike systems. The Air Force immediately re-activated Wizard as an entirely new project with Convair and RCA, and later added Lockheed-Raytheon and the Bell Labs-Douglas Aircraft team developing Nike. The Air Force called Wizard the \\"Top Defense Missile\\" in 1957. In 1958, with the Army's Nike Zeus system planning to enter testing and Wizard still a paper project, The Pentagon told the Air Force to limit their work to long-range radars. In 1959 the Air Force cancelled Wizard, stating that any ABM system was less cost effective than building more ICBMs. These arguments would also be directed against Zeus, which was cancelled in 1963. Background Between 1944 and 1945, about 3,600 German V-2 rockets were fired at allied targets in Europe. Armed with conventional high-explosive warheads, the V-2 had little serious strategic value, but if armed with nuclear weapons they could be significant weapons used against field targets in Europe. On 20 June 1945, the Army Ground Forces Equipment Review Board, or Cook Board, listed the requirement for \\"High velocity guided missiles...capable of...destroying missiles of the V-2 type, should be developed at the earliest practicable date.\\" In July 1945 the Signal Corps started basic research into two radar systems for ABM use. By 1 April 1946 Robert P. Patterson, the Secretary of War, had signed off on an ABM. In February 1946 the War Department's Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment led by General Joseph Stilwell and generally known as the Stilwell Board was formed to consider the Army's post-war development priorities. On 29 May 1946 they published their report on a \\"Proposed National Program for Guided Missiles\\", noting that missiles with \\"intercontinental ranges of over 3,000 miles and payload sufficient to carry atomic explosive are to be expected.\\" They suggested that defensive measures including anti-missiles should be \\"accorded priority over all other National Defense projects\\" and that the system be capable of supersonic speeds and range. Projects start By this time the US Army Air Force (USAAF) had already started work on anti-V-2 weapons. On 4 March 1946 they sent out a contracts to University of Michigan and General Electric for \\"interceptor weapons for ballistic missile defense\\". The contracts called for missiles capable of dealing with targets between altitude at speeds up to and maximum range of . The contracts were called Project Wizard and Project Thumper, respectively, and in keeping with USAAF project naming policy, given the codes MX-794 and MX-795.Max Rosenberg, \\"The Air Force and the National Guided Missile Program\\", Lulu.com, 2012, p. 43. The planned missiles were long and in diameter, with a range of . with speeds of 4,000 to 5,000 mph with a 50 percent kill probability against a V-2. Early results from Thumper and Wizard suggested that the problem was well beyond the state of the art. V-2's had flight times on the order of 5 minutes, and an attack could be carried out from any point within its approximate range. Early detection would require large radar systems (Chain Home was used for this purpose during World War II) which would have to calculate the approximate impact point and forward targeting information to an anti-missile battery in time for them to locate the target on their own radars and launch their missiles. Air Material Command estimated it would be five to ten years before the long-range radars, highly accurate guidance systems and long-range radar seekers could be developed. However, they also suggested that these tasks would not be impossible given emerging technologies, especially against long-ranged missiles with longer flight times and higher apogee, which would give the early warning radar more time to track the targets. Accordingly, both projects were downgraded to long-term technology studies in the summer of 1947, allocated $1 million each. Thumper, Wizard and GAPA merge With the creation of a separate United States Air Force (USAF) on 18 September 1947, the War Department divided up roles between the Army and the Air Force. There was no concern over the transfer of air-to-surface or air-to-air weapons, which went to the Air Force, but there was considerable debate over surface- to-surface and surface-to-air (SAM) weapons. The Air Force argued that it should be placed in command of all anti-air forces, including anti-aircraft artillery, as they would be operating in concert with the AF's fighters in the defense role. Ultimately the Army retained only one of the SAM projects, Nike, as this had originally been part of the Army Ordnance Department, not the Army Air Force. By 1949 increasing budget pressures along with the success of the Army's Nike led to the Air Force's MX-606 Boeing Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft (GAPA) anti-aircraft project being slated for cancellation. GAPA offered range and performance similar to Nike, but was nowhere near ready for deployment, while early Nike systems were already being test flown. At the same time the Soviet testing of a nuclear weapon and display of the Tu-4 Bull bomber placed the continental United States under the threat of attack, and attention quickly shifted away from the V-2 problem. To save what was their only SAM project in what was rapidly becoming an area of serious concern, the Air Force cancelled Thumper and its remaining funds were re-directed to GAPA. Wizard carried on as before, subsuming the Thumper work as well. In January 1950 the USAF asked Boeing and MARC to consider merging the GAPA and Wizard projects. Wizard's long-range radars and communications systems, combined with a greatly enlarged GAPA powered by ramjets, would offer a clear alternative to the ranged GAPA or Nike. By June the teams' design was for a Mach 3 winged missile to intercept aircraft at up to away, eventually emerging as the CIM-10 Bomarc. Wizard ABM efforts ended. Through the early 1950s, the entire ABM concept was largely ignored in favour of work on anti-aircraft systems. By 1954, Nike was beginning deployment and the Army was already beginning to explore advanced versions of the Nike concept that would emerge as the Hercules. Bomarc, meanwhile, was having considerable trouble at all levels. The 1959 \\"Missile Master Plan\\" later included both the Hercules and Bomarc for SAM air defense. (Windsor Daily Star article: Peek Slated At Missile Master Plan Retrieved 2011-09-28) Ultimately, only a small Bomarc force would enter service as the Air Force moved their priorities elsewhere. New Wizard Meanwhile, the nature of the strategic threat was changing once again. The Air Force had begun early studies of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) under MX-1593 in 1951, but this called for a warhead weight of and would require an enormous missile to deliver it. A test series in 1954 demonstrated highly favourable results from much lighter hydrogen bomb designs, and suddenly the ICBM appeared to be a very practical possibility. A contract was awarded to Convair for what would become the SM-65 Atlas on 14 January 1955.Dennis R. Jenkins, \\"Stage-and-a-Half, The Atlas Launch Vehicle\\", To Reach the High Frontier (University Press of Kentucky, 2002) pp. 74-85 With this change in strategic threat from aircraft to missiles, in 1954 the Army contracted Johns Hopkins University's operational research office (ORO) to prepare a detailed report on an ABM capable of countering ICBMs. In 1955 they followed this with a contract with Bell Labs, who developed Nike and Hercules, to determine whether an ABM system was now within the state of the art. Bell took 18 months to deliver their response, stating that recent developments in radars, and especially transistorized computers, offered the range and performance needed for the mission. Bell was given the go-ahead to start development in 1957, under the name Nike Zeus. Almost immediately after the announcement of the new Army ABM program, in 1955 the Air Force started their own anti-ICBM development under the Wizard name. Convair won the prime contractor contest, partnering with RCA for the radar and computer systems. The Air Force soon followed this with similar contracts for a Lockheed- Raytheon group, and also invited Bell Labs-Douglas Aircraft to join. Both forces were now in a direct fight to deliver an ABM system, even competing for the teams who would handle development. Wilson reforms While all of this was going on, inter-service fighting between the Army and Air Force was reaching a crescendo. This was due largely to the Army's intermediate-range Jupiter missile, which let the Air Force to hurriedly introduce their own IRBM, Thor. The Army argued that the medium-range role was basically an extension of their artillery service; they had used a similar argument to retain control of Nike, which had finally been conclusively handed to the Army after a long fight, by stating they were an extension of the mission previously held by anti-aircraft guns. The Air Force maintained that they were in control of the strategic force and should be in control of all long-range weapons. The fighting soon encompassed practically every area where the Army and Air Force had competing interests, including Jupiter and Thor, Nike and Bomarc, and Zeus and Wizard. Trying to solve this problem, US Secretary of Defense, Charles Erwin Wilson considered a wide variety of problems between the forces. On 26 November 1956 he ordered that the Army would be in control of \\"point defense\\" systems and that the Air Force would be responsible for \\"area defense\\" systems. This had always unofficially been the case; the Army's weapons had generally been placed close to their targets due to performance limits, but now Wilson specified these to mean range in the surface-to-surface role, while surface-to-air systems would be limited to only . This forced the Army to turn over its Jupiter systems to the Air Force, and to limit the range of their ABM and advanced anti-aircraft developments. Wizard cancelled In August 1957 the Soviets successfully launched their R-7 Semyorka (SS-6) ICBM, and followed this up with the successful launch of Sputnik 1 in October. The threat of ICBM attack was now very real. Forming a panel to investigate the issue in August 1957, the new Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy published a lengthy report on the concept on 16 January 1958. Having considered the stages of development of the various systems, McElroy essentially overturned the Wilson memo. In a \\"directive halting the WIZARD program\\", the Air Force was ordered to cease development of Wizard as a missile system, and use the project solely to develop long-range early-warning radars systems. The Air Force was already working on this as BMEWS, which they initially intended to work with a Wizard ABM. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop the Zeus system as they saw fit. Two months later the Air Force appealed the decision, stating that \\"the Army's ZEUS did not have the growth potential to handle possible enemy evasion decoy and countermeasure tactics.\\" This did not result in Wizard being re-funded, and ultimately the Assistant Secretary to the Air Force, Richard Horner, would state in 1959 that the cost of Wizard would outweigh any possible benefits, and that money would be better spent on more the offence. The arguments they outlined were so persuasive they led, ultimately, to the cancellation of the Zeus program, and continued controversy over all the ABM projects that followed it.

Members of the subfamily are informally and collectively known as \\"yaguarasaurines\\" and have been recovered from North and South America and Europe. Three genera, Yaguarasaurus, Russellosaurus and Romeosaurus are known.Yaguarasaurus and Russellosaurus were previously considered part of the Tethysaurinae until they were grouped with Romeosaurus as yaguarasaurines. Like the closely related tethysaurines, all yaguarasaurines were plesiopedal (meaning primitive and not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs). They generally retained relatively small sizes compared to later giant mosasaurs, though Yaguarasaurus itself might have grown rather large. The yaguarasaurines appeared during the Turonian and might have survived into the Santonian, though they were extinct by the Campanian when more derived and hydropedal mosasaurs had appeared. The etymology of this group derives from the genus Yaguarasaurus (after the town Yaguará and sauros, Greek for \\"lizard\\").  Description  Skeleton of Romeosaurus. Yaguarasaurines were primitive and comparatively small to medium- sized mosasaurs that lived during the earlier stages of mosasaur evolutionary history. Yaguarasaurus columbianus itself is the largest species of the subfamily, with the largest known skeleton at a length of 5 metres and a massive isolated skull indicating larger sizes. This proves that primitive mosasaurs were not necessarily all small. They had a plesiopedal limb condition, meaning that they were not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs and probably kept to shallow bodies of water. Palci et al. (2013) diagnosed the Yaguarasaurinae as the most recent common ancestor of Russellosaurus, Romeosaurus, and Yaguarasaurus, and all of its descendants. Unambiguous character states were listed as follows: \\"frontals not invaded by posterior end of nares (i.e., lack of distinct narial emargination on frontals); jugal rami form a 90◦ angle and produce a distinct posteroventral process at their junction; quadrate ala forms a shallow concavity; medial parapet of dentary (dentary medial shelf) low, tooth roots largely exposed in medial view; dentary has a projection anterior to the first tooth (reversed in Russellosaurus)\\".  Phylogeny  Yaguarasaurinae was created with the description of Romeosaurus, prior to its description the other genera in the subfamily were considered members of the Tethysaurinae.

Around this time, perhaps as compensation for the lost bishopric, William became the abbot of the monastery of Santa Maria della Matina in Calabria. There is some confusion over the name of this abbey, but in letters from his brother Peter, William is referred to as abbas Matinensis or Mathinensis, a name which became emended to Maniacensis (Maniaci) in the Histoire Littéraire de France, which nonetheless correctly identifies the abbey. Although the abbey was Benedictine at the time, as was William,Cotts The Clerical Dilemma p. 248 it became Cistercian in 1179/80. While he was still abbot, William received letters from his brother saying that William had not acquired his position in the best mannerCotts The Clerical Dilemma p. 28 and urging him to leave Italy and return to France. William agreed to do so, but it is not known if he actually left. William has been confused in the past with William de Blois, who was Bishop of Lincoln in England and died in 1206.

In addition to the \\"Target Control System AN/SRW-4D\\" with radios and \\"Antenna Assemblies for Target Control and Communications (7 Units)\\", the ATCC included acquisition/surveillance and tracking radars, a Mark X IFF/SIF, and an analog computer. The ATCC's automatic tracking radar was derived from the Western Electric M-33 gun laying radar and could process double-pulse 9340-9370 MHz beacon returns from transponders up to away from the AN/MSQ-51 transmitting 9215-9285 MHz radar pulses. If an ATCC was equipped with a \\"Telemetry Receiving Station\\", IRIG channels 5-14 could also be received from QF-9G and Q-2C unmanned aerial vehicles. Other ATCC-controlled drones included the QF-9F, KDA-1, KDA-4, KDB-1 and KD2R-5. For \\"RF communications (2 to 25 mc.)\\" to command the drone was a \\"Collins Radio Co.

More specifically, it refers to deliberately manipulating legal arrangements for purposes they were not meant for, guided by self-interested motives. Usually, legal opportunism is understood to occur legally: it is itself not necessarily a \\"crime\\" (a violation of the law or an unlawful act), but it could be considered \\"immoral\\" (\\"there ought to be a law against it\\"). The general effect of legal opportunism, if it really occurs, is that it discredits the rule of law or destroys the legitimacy of particular legal rules in the eyes of the people affected by them. Inversely, if people perceive a legal framework as arbitrary, obstructive or irrelevant, they are tempted to search for opportunities to find ways \\"around the law\\", without formally breaking the law. Typical of legal opportunists is that they accept or approve of the application of legal rules when it suits their own interest but reject or disapprove of the application when the rules are against their interest (or if taking self-interested action would mean breaking the law).Joanna Brylak, \\"Legal awareness and access to law\\". University of Warsaw, c. 2007, p. 5. The law should serve them, and not the other way around; or, there is \\"one rule for them, and another rule for other people.\\" Often, legal opportunism is enabled because a rule must be interpreted in order to apply it (i.e., how exactly it applies in the given situation is not self-evident or obvious), where the chosen interpretation is precisely the one that favours one's self- interest. If a situation is governed by many different and possibly conflicting rules, some choices may be possible in deciding exactly which rule applies. The opportunist then picks the option that suits himself. It may be that the original circumstances a rule was intended for have changed, so that the rule in reality gains a different significance from what it originally had—creating an ambiguity that some could exploit opportunistically. Since there are many dubious ways to manipulate the applicability of legal rules and procedures for selfish purposes, a general definition of legal opportunism (one which covers all cases) is exceptionally difficult. All the types of opportunism mentioned in this article may appear in a specifically legal form. Legal opportunism can involve practices such as the following: *Making or changing laws not for the good of the country as a whole, but to benefit a particular interest group in the country. *Making or changing laws, primarily to benefit the position of the lawmakers themselves.\\"It should be no surprise that when rich men take control of the government, they pass laws that are favorable to themselves. The surprise is that those who are not rich vote for such people, even though they should know from bitter experience that the rich will continue to rip off the rest of us. Perhaps the reason is that rich men are very clever at covering up what they do.\\" - Andrew Greeley, \\"U.S. should try to reduce income disparity\\". Chicago Sun-Times, 18 February 2001. *Applying or referring to legal procedures not for the sake of obtaining justice (or so that justice is served), but mainly with the aim of making money out of it, or promote one’s own position, or to place competitors at a disadvantage. *Exploiting legal loopholes or ambiguities for personal gain or to the advantage of a particular organization. *In some cases, \\"tinkering with\\" bad legislation, formalities or rulings \\"after the fact\\": after it is proved that a legal rule previously established is definitely unjust, wrong, inapplicable, mistaken etc. or incriminating someone using a new rule adopted only after the alleged crime was committed. *Deliberately \\"embellishing\\" selective evidence relevant to a legal situation, to benefit one's own position, in ways that are not strictly illegal. *Trying to sway legal opinion about a case by using arguments or utterances that appeal to the audience, but have substantively nothing to do with the case at hand. *\\"Cherry-picking\\" pieces of evidence, rules or precedents to construct a justification for the policy option that favour's one's own interest. In an adversarial system all kinds of tactics can be legitimately used by lawyers in a self-interested way to help them win their case, without being illegal. Therefore, to prove \\"legal opportunism\\" as a specific form of abuse of the legal process, for some selfish purpose, can be quite a challenge. Normally, a modern system of law assumes, that citizens as legal subjects all have the same legal status before the law, and that the law is applied uniformly to all citizens in the same way, under the same circumstances. However, *There can always be differences about the interpretation of the exact meaning, purpose, intent and application of laws in particular situations. *Rules can be constructed in ways that are formally the same for everyone but really advantage some and disadvantage others. *There may be new and novel situations where the law's applicability is unclear. *The combination of different systems of rules can create unforeseen consequences or uncertainty about how to apply the rules, or about which rule applies in a given case. *A legal rule, although enacted in a statute, may state or imply a principle that is impossible to enforce systematically for some reason, with the effect that people follow their own interpretation in a self-interested way without penalty. All of these make possible an opportunist exploitation of legal frameworks by legal subjects, for self-interested motives without necessarily violating any legal principle, though the intention of the law (the real purpose or aim that inspired it) is negated.

It was published as a hardcover by W. W. Norton & Company in 2012 and as a paperback in 2013. It is actually the prequel to his 2010 book How it Ends, which talks about how everything, from individual humans, to the human species, to the Earth, and finally, the universe, might one day end in the future. Summary How It Began: A Time Traveler’s Guide to the Universe is a non-fiction book by astronomy professor Chris Impey on the origins of everything from the Moon to the universe itself. The finite speed of light and the vastness of space turn modern large telescopes into time machines and astronomers into armchair time travelers. Looking out in space is looking back in time. Each chapter has vignettes that place the reader in increasingly unfamiliar physical situations that are increasingly unfamiliar. How It Began has an associated web site containing source material on each major topic. The first third of the book deals with the proximate universe. The journey starts with the Moon and its formation from an impact with the infant Earth. Next stop is the outer Solar System and the amazing process by particles of dust grew into planets. The nearest star is the place where star formation is considered, followed by the Orion Nebula, where young stars are forming at a furious rate. The last stop in the nearby universe is the center of our galaxy, site of a black hole four million times the mass of the Sun. The second third of the book examines the remote universe. Andromeda is seen as it was before humans evolved on the plains of Africa, and galaxies are all seen over time spans that dwarf our existence. The next stop is the massive Coma cluster of galaxies, a swarm of thousands of galaxies bound by invisible dark matter. This section continues with a visit to galaxies that created their stars long before the Earth formed and it finished with the time when stars first congealed out of gas in the expanding universe, 200 million years after the Big Bang. The last third of the book ventures into the alien universe. The microwave background radiation is a relic of time when stable atoms first formed and the “fog lifted” in the infant universe. Reaching back to the time when the universe was as hot as the core of a star, the Big Bang is manifested in the creation of helium. The last chapters of the book cross into the realm of speculation, with descriptions the tiny asymmetry in the forces of nature that led to a tiny excess of matter over antimatter, the early exponential expansion that flattened space-time, and the idea of the universe as one quantum event among many. Reception How It Began received strong reviews. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Manjit Kumar wrote “In clear, enthusiastic and occasionally lyrical prose, Mr. Impey takes the reader on a mind-blowing tour back through eons, stopping along the way to explain the formation of the solar system, the birth and death of stars, white dwarfs, supernovas, spiral galaxies, cosmic inflation, string theory, black holes and M-theory”. Maclean's magazine notes “With Impey flexing his creative writing muscles, How It Began could almost be a science fiction novel. But when he describes what we really do know about the universe—and questions we’re grappling with—it’s even more incredible than anything a science fiction writer could dream up”. Science fiction author Ben Bova said “Chris Impey has achieved the near- impossible: an accurate, up-to-date account of ‘the state of the universe’ that is told in gripping human terms. A great achievement and a ‘must-read’ book.” Kirkus Reviews concluded its review with “An astute tour of the cosmos by a skillful teacher.” Notes External links * * W. W.

Usually the implication is that doing so is unprincipled in some way, although it may cause no harm and involve no abuse. In other words, religion becomes a means to achieve something that is alien to it, or things are projected into religion that do not belong there. Any human being has at least some kind of spiritual sense, developed through personal reflection or undeveloped but evident from lifestyle and communications, which defines the meta-meanings of human existence, the purpose of life, the meaning of the universe and one's own place in it, and so on. This belief system may, or may not be expressed through the categories and concepts of a religion; it could be only assumed, rather than explicit. Whatever the case, such beliefs can be used in a way that they become a source of profit. If a religious authority acquires influence over the \\"hearts and minds\\" of people who are believers in a religion, and therefore can \\"tap into\\" the most intimate and deepest-felt concerns of believers, it can also gain immense power from that. This power can be used in a self-interested manner, exploiting opportunities to benefit the position of the religious authority or its supporters in society. This could be considered as inconsistent with the real intentions of the religious belief, or it might show lack of respect for the spiritual autonomy of others. The \\"good faith\\" of people is then taken advantage of, in ways that involve some kind of deceit, or some dubious, selfish motive. Even although, in his Treatise on Toleration (1763), the famous French liberal philosopher Voltaire expressed a distaste for religious fanaticism, he was at the same time convinced that religion could be a useful tool to keep the masses under control. He said famously, \\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.\\" In his Épître à l'Auteur du Livre des Trois Imposteurs, a criticism of atheism in which he makes this remark, Voltaire opined that faith in God is a \\"sublime system\\" that is \\"necessary to man\\": it is, \\"...the sacred tie that binds society.\\" Similar ideas have been expressed by numerous political leaders, business leaders, and intellectuals for centuries, both right-wing and left-wing. In their utopias of social engineering, early socialistic thinkers such as Auguste Comte (Treatise on Sociology Instituting the Religion of Humanity 1851-54) and Henri de Saint- Simon (New Christianity 1825) envisaged a new secular (or \\"scientific\\") belief-system, analogous to a religion, which would unite the people humanely, and ensure social cohesion.Frank Furedi, \\"Glaube: Wie aus dem Atheismus eine Pseudo-Religion wurde\\". NovoArgumente, 18 April 2012. This idea is not as unrealistic as it sounds,Yasmin Anwar, \\"Highly religious people are less motivated by compassion than are non-believers\\". UC Berkeley News Center, April 30, 2012. but it could be interpreted as an opportunist use of people's faith for political purposes. Politicians around the world recognize the power of religion, and therefore they usually try to keep on the good side of religious authorities and believers.For example, see: Subir Bhaumik, \\"China and India use Buddha for regional karma\\". Al Jazeera English (online), 11 January 2012. They are very aware, that religion can be not just a force for social stability, but can also be the cause of enormous animosity among the peoples, if spiritual sensitivities are offended. For example, when in February 2012 protests broke out in various parts of Afghanistan over the improper disposal of Korans at the US military Bagram Air Base, the US government apologized officially (see 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests). Some religious wars and crusades have lasted a very long time, being pursued quite relentlessly - regardless of the number of casualties, and regardless of who happened to be winning. It creates plenty potential to exploit religious likes and dislikes opportunistically, to advance political, social or business interests. The term spiritual opportunism is also used in the sense of casting around for suitable spiritual beliefs borrowed and cobbled together in some way to justify, condemn or \\"make sense of\\" particular ways of behaving, usually with some partisan or ulterior motive. This may not be abusive, but it often gives rise to criticisms or accusationsAn example is Robert M. Price, Top Secret: The Truth Behind Today’s Pop Mysticisms. Prometheus Books, 2008 that the given spiritual beliefs: *are not an organic, sincere or authentic expression of the real nature of the people who contrived them. *do not really express what people's lives are about, but are in some way an \\"artificial add-on\\". *lack any deeper principled foundation, and are more an \\"eclectic, self-serving concoction\\" *are made to serve partisan interests, contrary to the real intention of the beliefs. Supporters of traditional religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism or Buddhism sometimes complain that people (such as New Age enthusiasts) seek out spiritual beliefs that serve only themselves, as a form of \\"spiritual opportunism\\". Such complaints are often highly controversial, because people are considered to have the right to their own spiritual beliefs (they may not have that right, to the extent that they are socially excluded unless they profess certain spiritual beliefs, but they may only subscribe \\"formally\\" or \\"outwardly\\" to them). Because spiritual beliefs are a highly personal matter in the first instance and concern personal meanings, they are often difficult to criticize because \\"they just are what they are\\". As they concern highly abstract, metaphysical principles, it is difficult to prove their inconsistency, even using the criterion of whether people \\"act according to their beliefs\\". People can always argue that the personal meaning they attach to something or the personal associations they make, cannot be adequately expressed in the language of others. If accusations of spiritual opportunism are made, therefore, evidential proof depends greatly on what people are willing to reveal (or \\"confess\\") about themselves in what they say and do. Spiritual opportunism sometimes refers also to the practice of proselytizing one's spiritual beliefs when any opportunity to do so arises, for the purpose of winning over, or persuading others, about the superiority of these beliefs. In this context, the spiritual opportunist may engage in various actions, themselves not directly related to the spiritual beliefs, with the specific aim of convincing others of the superiority of his own belief system – it may effectively amount to \\"buying their support\\".

It was taped in 10 episodes at Woodhouse's home in Hertfordshire, England. The show was also internationally syndicated. In the show she often used two commands: \\"walkies\\" and \\"sit\\"; the latter of which was parodied in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy where James Bond does a Woodhouse impersonation, puts his hand up in a command posture, repeats Woodhouse's catch-phrase to a tiger and the animal responds to it by obeying. Her ten-part series had been shown at over one hundred stations in the United States and in Britain it proved so popular it was run twice. In 1982, singer-songwriter Randy Edelman wrote a song about her and her show, \\"Barbara (The Woodhouse Way)\\", which he released in a single 45 rpm record. Summary The series was produced by Peter Riding and first shown on BBC2 between 7 January and 10 March 1980. It made Woodhouse famous and enabled her to popularise her dog-training ideas widely among pet owners in Britain and abroad. She believed that there is no such thing as a bad dog but simply inadequate owners who did not assert their position in the pecking order of dog society. Her approach influenced other dog trainers such as Victoria Stilwell, who advocated similar ideas on her show It's Me or the Dog. Although her show was very popular, her advocacy for better-designed and more humane cages for dog transportation was slow in gaining widespread acceptance. In her show she was known for issuing abrupt commands to the owners, and for her on-air criticism of their behaviour. More often than not, the owners looked terrified rather than the dogs. Reception The show achieved cult status in the United States and millions of people accommodated their schedule around the showtimes of its broadcast in a similar manner to the successful Upstairs Downstairs. At the same time they widely and cheerfully adopted her vocabulary using her commands \\"walkies\\" and \\"sit\\". The show was broadcast in the United States by PBS in 1983.

For installation in nuclear bunkers, the command posts were to replace the last of the planned Air Defense Command Combat Centers to be built for vacuum tube AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Centrals. The survivable SCCs were to use solid- state (transistorized) AN/FSQ-32 equipment which was to provide the Semi- Automatic Ground Environment for operators at 10 Air Divisions — 5 of the centers were to also serve as Air Defense Direction Centers (\\"SCC/DCs\\") for commanding ground-controlled interception in sectors of the 27th, 30th, 32nd, 33rd, and 35th Air Divisions. ADC's November 1958 plan to complete the hardened SCCs by April 1964 included fielding 3 additional AN/FSQ-32 systems above-ground for the Albuquerque, Miami, and Shreveport sectors. (Plans for vacuum tube AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Centrals to be installed in hardened \\"cube\\" buildings were continued for 21 SAGE Air Defense Direction Centers for most of the 27 NORAD Sectors.) Description SCCs were to be able to withstand overpressure as from a nuclear explosion. Some caverns were to be excavated in mountains: Kennesaw Mountain GA and Whitehorse Mountain NY for the Raleigh and Syracuse sectors, respectively. In 1956, ARDC had sponsored \\"development of a transistorized…computer\\" by IBM and in June 1958, the \\"SAGE Solid State Computer…was estimated to have a computing capability of seven times\\" the AN/FSQ-7. ADC's November 1958 plan to field—by April 1964—the 13 solid state AN/FSQ-7A (designated AN/FSQ-32 after December 1958) was for divisions at Ottawa, St Louis, San Antonio, Raleigh, Syracuse, Chicago, Spokane, Minot, Portland, Phoenix, and 3 above-ground sites for Miami, Albuquerque, and Shreveport divisions. By December 1959 an SCC was also planned for the 26th Air Division (Denver Air Defense Sector). Cancellation DoD's June 19, 1959, Continental Air Defense Program reduced the number of SCCs to 7 and on December 9, 1959, the USAF eliminated both the SCC for the Denver sector and the Albuquerque sector's above-ground AN/FSQ-32. On December 21, 1959, the Office of Defense Research and Engineering informed NORAD a stop order had been placed on AN/FSQ-32 production and in January 1960, the Office of the Secretary of Defense recommended the SCC program be canceled (cancellation was March 18, 1960.) The canceled SAGE SCC/DC planned for the 35th NORAD Region/Ottawa Air Defense Sector was replaced with the only vacuum tube AN/FSQ-7 deployed underground. Construction of CFB North Bay for the Ottawa sector had started in 1959 for a bunker ~ underground, and the facility was used for DC-31 )operational October 1, 1963) (3 AN/FSQ-8 Combat Centers were operational in 1963.) To replace the GCI contingency capability that SCCs would have provided when an AN/FSQ-7 Direction Center and its neighboring DCs had been incapacitated, Air Defense Command deployed pre-SAGE General Electric AN/GPA-37 Course Directing Groups at NORAD Control Centers and other dispersed sites for Back-Up Interceptor Control.

It is a mild reagent, suitable for both acid and base sensitive compounds. Its great reactivity with lactols makes the Fétizon oxidation a useful method to obtain lactones from a diol. The reaction is inhibited significantly by polar groups within the reaction system as well as steric hindrance of the α-hydrogen of the alcohol. Preparation Fétizon's reagent is typically prepared by adding silver nitrate to an aqueous solution of a carbonate, such as sodium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate, while being vigorously stirred in the presence of purified celite. Mechanism A proposed mechanism for the oxidation of an alcohol by Fétizon's reagent involves single electron oxidation of both the alcoholic oxygen and the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol by two atoms of silver(I) within the celite surface. The carbonate ion then proceeds to deprotonate the resulting carbonyl generating bicarbonate which is further protonated by the additionally generated hydrogen cation to cause elimination of water and generation of carbon dioxide.Tojo, Gabriel (2006) \\"Fétizon's reagent: Silver Carbonate on Celite.\\" Oxidation of Alcohols to Aldehydes and Ketones. US: Springer. pp. 281–288. Silver carbonate on celite oxidizes alcohols through single electron oxidation by the silver cations Even weakly associating functionalities such as olefins can interfere with the association of the reactant alcohol with Fetizon's reagent The rate limiting step of this reaction is proposed to be the initial association of the alcohol to the silver ions. As a result, the presence of even weakly associating ligands to the silver can inhibit the reaction greatly. As a result, even slightly polar solvents of any variety, such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone, are avoided when using this reagent as they competitively associate with the reagent. Additional polar functionalities of the reactant should also be avoided whenever possible as even the presence of an alkene can sometimes reduce the reactivity of a substrate 50 fold. Commonly employed solvents such as benzene and xylene are extremely non-polar and further acceleration of the reaction can be achieved through the use of the more non-polar heptane. The solvent is also typically refluxed to drive the reaction with heat and remove the water generated by the reaction through azeotropic distillation. Steric hindrance of the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol is a major determination of the rate of oxidation as it effects the rate of association. Tertiary alcohols lacking an alpha hydrogen are selected against and generally do not oxidize in the presence of Fétizon's reagent. The oxidation of an alcohol with an alpha hydrogen sterically hindered by axial hydrogens proceeds slower with Fetizon's reagent Increasing the amount of celite used in the reagent accelerates the rate of the reaction by increasing the surface area available to react. However, increasing the amount of celite past 900 grams per mole of silver(I) carbonate begins to slow the reaction due to dilution effects. Reactivity Fétizon's reagent is used primarily in the oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones with a slight selectivity toward secondary alcohols and unsaturated alcohols. The reaction is typically done in a refluxing dry non-polar organic solvent with copious stirring. The reaction time varies with the structure of the alcohol and is typically completed within three hours. A very attractive property of Fétizon's reagent is its ability to be separated from the reaction product by physically filtering it out and washing with benzene. The inability of Fétizon's reagent to oxidize tertiary alcohols makes it extremely useful in the monooxidation of a [1,2] diol in which one of the alcohols is tertiary while avoiding cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond. Fetizon's reagent oxidizes secondary alcohols selectively in the presence of tertiary alcohols The mildness and structural sensitivity of the reagent also makes this reagent ideal for the monooxidation of a symmetric diol. Fetizon's reagent is capable of monooxidizing a symmetric diol Lactols are extremely sensitive to Fétizon's reagent, being oxidized very quickly to a lactone functionality. This allows for the selective oxidation of lactols in the presence of other alcohols. This also allows for a classic use of Fétizon's reagent to form lactones from a primary diol. By oxidizing one of the alcohols to an aldehyde, the second alcohol equilibrates with the aldehyde to form a lactol which is reacted quickly with more Fétizon's reagent to trap the cyclic intermediate as a lactone. This method allows for the synthesis of seven-member lactones which are traditionally more challenging to synthesize. Fetizon's reagent oxidize lactols into lactones Treatment of a terminal diol with Fetizon's reagent can result in lactone formation Phenol functional groups can be oxidized to their respective quinone forms. These quinones can further couple within solution producing numerous dimerizations depending upon their substituents. Fetizon's reagent oxidizes phenols to quinones which can oxidatively couple to one another Amines have been shown to oxidize in the presence of Fétizon's reagent to enamines and iminium cations that have been trapped, but can also be selected against in a compound with more easily oxidized alcohol functionalities. Fétizon's reagent can also being used to facilitate cycloaddition of a 4-hydroxy-2-furoquinilone and an olefin to form dihydrofuroquinolinones. Protecting groups Para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) is a commonly used protecting group for alcohols against Fétizon's reagent. As Fétizon's oxidation is a neutral reaction, acid and base sensitive protecting groups are also compatible with the reagent and by products generated. Sensitive groups While tertiary alcohols are typically not affected by Fétizon's reagent, tertiary propargylic alcohols have been shown to oxidize under these conditions and results in the fragmentation of the alcohol with an alkyne leaving group. A tertiary propargylic alcohol is fragmented upon treatment with Fetizon's reagent Halohydrins that possess a trans stereochemistry have been demonstrated to form epoxides and transposed products in the presence of Fétizon's reagent. Halohydrins possessing a cis- stereochemistry seem to perform a typical Fétizon's oxidation to a ketone. Trans-halohydrins can transpose or form epoxides upon treatment with Fetizon's reagent [1,3] diols have a tendency to eliminate water following the monooxidation by Fétizon's reagent to form an enone. Upon oxidation with Fetizon's reagent, a 1,3 diol may eliminate water to produce an enone Under differing structural conditions, [1,2] diols can form diketones in the presence of Fétizon's reagent. However, oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage may also occur. Applications Since its discovery as a useful method of oxidation, Fétizon's reagent has been used in the total synthesis of numerous molecules such as (±)-bukittinggine. Fétizon's reagent has also been employed extensively in the study of various sugar chemistry, to achieve selective oxidation of tri and tetra methylated aldoses to aldolactones, oxidation of D-xylose and L-arabinose to D-threose and L-erythrose respectively, and oxidation of L-sorbose to afford L-threose among many others.

Jones is the first openly gay black person and first openly LGBT black person elected to the Florida Legislature. Term-limited from his position, he ran for the Florida Senate in a crowded primary for District 35 facing no Republican opposition in the general election. History Jones was born in Hollywood to Eric Jones, the current Mayor of West Park. He attended Florida A&M; University, where he graduated with a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology in 2006. After graduation, he returned to South Florida, where he taught Advanced Placement Chemistry in Broward County Public Schools, and then worked as an AP Biology instructor at Florida Atlantic University High School. In 2010, he ran for a seat on the Broward County Commission in District 8, running against Barbara Sharief and Angelo Castillo. Jones attacked Sharief and Castillo in a mailer over the fact that they would have to resign their positions in local government if they were elected, declaring, \\"Both of my opponents are incumbent politicians who have abandoned their oath to serve us for the full term for which they campaigned. Now the taxpayers of Pembroke Pines and Miramar will have to pay thousand[s] more for [s]pecial Election[s] needed to replace them.

Florida House of Representatives In 2012, after the Florida House of Representatives districts were redrawn, Jones opted to run in the newly created 101st District. He initially was set to face Pembroke Park Mayor Ashira Mohammed and Hollywood City Commissioner Beam Furr in the Democratic primary, but both Mohammed and Furr dropped out, and Jones won election to the House unopposed in both the primary and general elections.

Based on Ikke gjør dette hjemme, the show features hosts Teddy Wilson and Norm Sousa, who ignore the warning labels on a variety of household items, with varying results. The show made its debut on May 6, 2013 with two back-to-back episodes. The show has been bought by Spike TV to air in the United States. Reruns also air on MTV in Canada.  The hosts   Teddy Wilson  Teddy Wilson is best known as the host of InnerSPACE, a science- fiction news show airing on Space. He began his career in the entertainment industry as a child actor in You Can't Do That on Television. He went on to earn an Honours B.A. in political science and worked as a political advisor in the Ontario legislature. He left politics to work at MTV in 2005, and in 2008 was recruited by Space to host InnerSPACE. His first assignment was interviewing George Lucas.  Norm Sousa  Norm Sousa is a comedian and actor from Toronto currently living in New York City. He started his entertainment career at Humber College Comedy: Writing and Performance where, after graduation, he founded a comedy troupe called punchDRYSDALE which performed multiple times at the Toronto Sketch Comedy Festival. He later joined the comedy ensemble The Sketchersons, where he became the head writer and producer of Sunday Night Live.  Production  On September 12, 2012, following the success of Ikke gjør dette hjemme in Norway, Discovery Channel Canada secured the rights to produce the first English-language version of the show from Norwegian broadcaster NRK through independent distributor DRG. Insight TV was commissioned to produce 13 30-minute episodes for the first season. Similar shows are planned for the Danish, German, and Swedish TV markets. Filming began on an old farm house in southwestern Ontario where the hosts set up shop along with a crew of safety professionals, including firefighters. 20 cameras were installed in the farmhouse to capture every angle, including Phantom high-speed cameras that can capture 2,650 frames per second. The show focuses on the physics and chemistry behind the disasters caused by the hosts' experiments. Season 2 was filmed in the Bradford, Ontario area.  Critical response  Before the show's first episode aired, Bill Harris, of Canoe.ca, said the show appeals to \\"the defiant [...] kid [...] within all of us\\" and said the show works best when it focuses on potential disasters viewers might have wondered about, and said he didn't relate to experiments such as the walk-in microwave oven, since that's not what a normal person might think of.  Episodes  Season 1 (2013) 14 episodes aired in the first season, including a retrospective and behind-the-scenes special at the end of the season.

Catalytic trigger and catalytic oscillator  A simple scheme of the nonlinear kinetic oscillations in heterogeneous catalytic reactions has been proposed by Bykov, Yablonskii, and Kim in 1978.V.I. Bykov, G.S. Yablonskii, V.F. Kim, \\"On the simple model of kinetic self-oscillations in catalytic reaction of CO oxidation\\", Doklady AN USSR (Chemistry) 242 (3) (1978), 637–639. Authors have started from the catalytic trigger (1976M.G. Slin'ko, V.I. Bykov, G.S. Yablonskii, T.A. Akramov, \\"Multiplicity of the Steady State in Heterogeneous Catalytic Reactions\\", Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 226 (4) (1976), 876.), a simplest catalytic reaction without autocatalysis that allows multiplicity of steady states. Then they have supplemented this classical adsorption mechanism of catalytic oxidation by a \\"buffer\\" step Here, A2, B and AB are gases (for example, O2, CO and CO2), iz the \\"adsorption place\\" on the surface of the solid catalyst (for example, Pt), and are the intermediates on the surface (adatoms, adsorbed molecules or radicals) and (BZ) is an intermediate that does not participate in the main reaction Let the concentration of the gaseous components be constant. Then the law of mass action gives for this reaction mechanism a system of three ordinary differential equations that describes kinetics on the surface where is the concentration of the free places of adsorption on the surface (\\"per one adsorption centre\\"), x and y are the concentrations of AZ and BZ, correspondingly (also normalized \\"per one adsorption centre\\") and s is the concentration of the buffer component (BZ). This three-dimensional system includes seven parameters. The detailed analysis shows that there are 23 different phase portraits for this system, including oscillations, multiplicity of steady states and various types of bifurcations.A.I. Khibnik, V.I. Bykov, and G.S. Yablonski, \\"23 phase portraits of the simplest catalytic oscillator\\", J. Fiz. Khim. 61 (1987), 1388–1390 [in Russian]. English translation in Russian Journal of Physical Chemistry, Volume 61 (1987), 722–723.  Reactions without interaction of different components  Let the reaction mechanism consist of reactions :\\\\alpha_r A_{i_r} \\\\to \\\\sum_j \\\\beta_{rj}A_j \\\\, , where A_i are symbols of components, r is the number of the elementary reaction and \\\\alpha_r, \\\\beta_{rj} \\\\geq 0 are the stoichiometric coefficients (usually they are integer numbers). (We do not include the components that are present in excess and the components with almost constant concentrations) The Eley–Rideal mechanism of CO oxidation on Pt provides a simple example of such a reaction mechanism without interaction of different components on the surface: :2Pt(+O2) <=> 2Pt; \\\\;\\\\; {PtO} + CO <=> {Pt} + CO2\\\\\\\\!\\\\uparrow. Let the reaction mechanism have the conservation law :\\\\alpha_r m_{i_r}= \\\\sum_j \\\\beta_{rj} m_j \\\\text{ for some } m_j>0 \\\\text{ and all } r , and let the reaction rate satisfy the mass action law: :W_r= k_r c_{i_r}^{\\\\alpha_r}, where c_i is the concentration of A_i. Then the dynamic of the kinetic system is very simple: the steady states are stableV.I. Bykov, T.A. Akramov, and G.S. Yablonskii, \\"Studies of the dynamic properties of catalytic systems\\", In Mathematicheskie problemy khimii [Mathematical Problems of Chemistry], Part 1, 1975, Computing Center USSR Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk (in Russian), pp. 199–206. and all solutions \\\\mathbf{c}(t)=(c_i(t)) with the same value of the conservation law m(\\\\mathbf{c})= \\\\sum m_i c_i monotonically converge in the weighted l_1 norm: the distance between such solutions \\\\mathbf{c}^{(1)}(t),\\\\mathbf{c}^{(2)}(t), :\\\\\\\\mathbf{c}^{(1)}-\\\\mathbf{c}^{(2)}\\\\=\\\\sum_i m_i c^{(1)}_i-{c}^{(2)}_i , monotonically decreases in time.A.N. Gorban, V.I. Bykov, G.S. Yablonskii, \\"Thermodynamic function analogue for reactions proceeding without interaction of various substances\\", Chemical Engineering Science 41 (11) (1986), 2739–2745. This quasithermodynamic property of the systems without interaction of different components is important for the analysis of dynamics of catalytic reactions: nonlinear steps with two (or more) different intermediate reagents are responsible for nontrivial dynamical effects like multiplicity of steady states, oscillations or bifurcations. Without interaction of different components the kinetic curves converge in a simple norm even for open systems.  The extended principle of detailed balance  Detailed mechanism of many real physico-chemical complex systems includes both reversible and irreversible reactions. Such mechanisms are typical in homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic oxidation and complex enzyme reactions. The classical thermodynamics of perfect systems is defined for reversible kinetics and has no limit for irreversible reactions. In contrary, the mass action law gives the possibility to write the chemical kinetic equations for any combination of reversible and irreversible reactions. Without additional restrictions this class of equations is extremely wide and can approximate any dynamical system with preservation of positivity of concentrations and the linear conservation laws. (This general approximation theorem has been proved in 1986.A.N. Gorban, V.I. Bykov, G.S. Yablonskii, Essays on Chemical Relaxation, Nauka, Novosibirsk, 1986.) The model of real systems should satisfy some restrictions. Under the standard microscopic reversibility requirement, these restrictions should be formulated as follows: A system with some irreversible reactions should be a limit of the systems with all reversible reactions and the detailed balance conditions. Such systems have been completely described in 2011. The extended principle of detailed balance is the characteristic property of all systems which obey the generalized mass action law and are the limits of the systems with detailed balance when some of the reaction rate constants tend to zero (the Gorban-Yablonsky theorem). The extended principle of detailed balance consists of two parts: * The algebraic condition: The principle of detailed balance is valid for the reversible part. (This means that for the set of all reversible reactions there exists a positive equilibrium where all the elementary reactions are equilibrated by their reverse reactions.) * The structural condition: The convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions. (Physically, this means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented cyclic pathways.) The stoichiometric vector of the reaction \\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_{i} A_i \\\\to \\\\sum_j \\\\beta_{j} A_j is the gain minus loss vector with coordinates \\\\gamma_{i}=\\\\beta_i-\\\\alpha_i. (It may be useful to recall the formal convention: the linear span of empty set is {0}, the convex hull of empty set is empty.) The extended principle of detailed balance gives an ultimate and complete answer to the following problem: How to throw away some reverse reactions without violation of thermodynamics and microscopic reversibility? The answer is: the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions should not intersect with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions and the reaction rate constants of the remained reversible reactions should satisfy the Wegscheider identities.

He attended Sprayberry High School in Marietta and was a three-year starter and two-time All-League and All-County selection. As a senior in 2007, recorded 69 tackles, an interception, two fumble recoveries and two blocked extra points. He totaled more than 600 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns, caught 15 passes for 195 yards, and rushed 17 times for 156 yards during his final high school season. College career After originally committing to play at Michigan State, Trawick saw limited playing time in his first two years with the Spartans. He redshirted in 2008 and recorded just two tackles in 2009. He then transferred to Northeast Mississippi Community College in December 2009 after he was suspended from Michigan State for being present at a residence hall during an incident in which several of his teammates were charged with assault. “My heart just wasn’t in it,” Trawick said of his time as a Spartan. “I got focused on what wasn’t important, and I needed to switch it up and get refocused again.” While at Troy, Trawick had 206 tackles, one sack, three interceptions, nine pass deflections, and one forced fumble.

In the 2018 season, he made eight combined tackles. Baltimore Ravens (second stint) On August 1, 2019, Trawick signed with the Baltimore Ravens. He was placed on injured reserve on October 3, 2019, with an elbow injury. He was designated for return from injured reserve on November 14, 2019, and began practicing with the team again. On December 3, 2019, Trawick was activated from injured reserve. Personal life Trawick’s father, George, was the head basketball coach at DeVry University in the early 1990s. He coached in the highest-scoring men’s basketball game in NCAA history, regardless of division classification. On January 12, 1992, Troy State University defeated DeVry 253–141 in a game that is considered to have established several unbreakable records.

At the time the two fighters were the top two ranked contenders for the WBC, WBA, and IBF world heavyweight championships that were at the time held by Evander Holyfield. The bout was a twelve-round championship eliminator fight, with the winner becoming the mandatory challenger to Holyfield's crown. Tyson, the former champion, defeated Ruddock by technical knockout in the seventh round but the circumstances surrounding the stoppage nearly caused a riot and a rematch was signed to settle the dispute. Background Tyson and Ruddock had originally been set to face each other on November 18, 1989 in Edmonton, Alberta, in Ruddock's adopted home country of Canada for Tyson's undisputed world championship. However, the fight was postponed and ultimately cancelled because Tyson was suffering from costochondritis.Tyson-Ruddock Fight Postponed Until Next Year, L.A. Times article, 1989-10-26, Retrieved on 2013-05-07. Tyson instead would fight James \\"Buster\\" Douglas on February 11, 1990 in Tokyo, where he would be knocked out in a massive upset and lose his belts. Tyson would fight twice more in 1990 and won both bouts by first round knockout. He defeated 1984 Olympic gold medalist Henry Tillman on June 16 and then beat undefeated up-and-coming prospect Alex Stewart on December 8. Ruddock, meanwhile, had won twenty-five of his first twenty-seven fights, with his only defeat coming at the hands of journeyman David Jaco early in his career. He had also defeated former world champions Mike Weaver, James \\"Bonecrusher\\" Smith, and Michael Dokes along the way. On December 9, 1990, the day after Tyson defeated Stewart, Tyson promoter Don King announced Ruddock would indeed be Tyson's next opponent while also announcing that Tyson and Showtime had agreed to a blockbuster long term pay- per-view deal that would pay Tyson $120 million.Tyson Will Fight Ruddock Next, Former heavyweight champion also will sign $120-million deal with Showtime, L.A. Times article, 1990-12-10, Retrieved on 2013-05-07. The fight The fight was a hard fought one, with both men hitting each other with power punches throughout the fight. Early in the second round, Tyson scored a controversial knockdown. After being hit with a left hook to the shoulder, Ruddock tripped over Tyson's right leg and fell to the canvas. Referee Richard Steele awarded Tyson with the knockdown. Shortly after, Tyson would illegally hit Ruddock with a right hand as the two men were being separated by Steele, though Steele did not deduct a point from Tyson. Ruddock would suffer another knockdown late in round 3. After hitting Tyson with a straight left hand with less than 10 seconds to go in the round, Tyson countered with a powerful left hook to the side of Ruddock's head that again sent Ruddock to the canvas. Ruddock was able to get up at the count of 8 as the round ended. The fight would come to an end with less than a minute remaining in round 7. Tyson was able to hit Ruddock with a six-punch combination. Though Ruddock remained on his feet and was seemingly healthy enough to continue the fight, Steele stepped between the two fighters and stopped the fight, awarding Tyson the victory by technical knockout. The decision enraged Ruddock's corner with Ruddock's brother and manager, Delroy storming the ring to confront Steele. Tyson's trainer Richie Giachetti attempted to restrain Delroy but a melee ensued that also involved Ruddock's promoter Murad Muhammad.

It was designed for a single-seat fighter competition but did not reach production. Design and development The Letov Š-7 was designed for a 1923 government competition for a single-engine fighter, to be powered by a Škoda licence-built Hispano-Suiza 8Fb, a water-cooled V-8 engine. It was a single-bay biplane, the bays defined by parallel pairs of interplane struts. The wings, mounted with modest stagger, were straight edged and had the same constant chord and blunt wingtips. The upper wing was braced to the fuselage with a cabane formed, on each side, by a forward parallel pair of struts from the mid-fuselage and a rear inverted-V pair from the upper fuselage. Only the lower planes carried ailerons. Letov experienced some cooling problems with the Š-7's water-cooled engine. The aircraft as first flown had a ring-shaped radiator, but this was replaced with a transversely mounted, circular cross-section ventral radiator and the engine cowling revised. The modification resulted in a change of designation to Letov Š-7a. The Hispano engine drove a two-blade propeller with a domed spinner. Behind the engine, the fuselage had an oval cross-section, with the single open cockpit partially under the wing trailing edge, which had a shallow cutout to enhance his view. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a point behind the tail control surfaces. The straight edged, cropped lozenge- shaped horizontal tail was mounted on the fuselage centreline; the fin and rudder were also straight edged. The Š-7 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on cross-braced V-struts. It was armed with a pair of 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine guns, mounted in a dip in the engine cowling between the two cylinder banks, firing through the propeller arc. The Letov Š-7 first flew in 1923 but failed to gain orders and its development was discontinued.

The CFI headquarters is located in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada. The organization was founded in 2007 by Jeff Schnurr. After traveling to over 35 countries and working as a Canadian tree-planter, Jeff landed in Pemba, Tanzania. While living there, he was approached by a group of local fishermen who were interested in tree planting as a means for stabilizing the local environment. CFI's operating model is communities need to make their own change. In April 2009, CFI helped Tanzanians in Pemba incorporate their own organization, Community Forests Pemba (CFP). In 2010, Jeff was named one of Canada's Top 10 volunteers by the CBC Canada's Champions of Change a program run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with the goal of recognizing some of Canada's most active volunteers.  Community Forests Pemba (CFP)  Traditional agriculture, charcoal production and population expansion have left natural forest systems largely depleted across the island of Pemba, Tanzania. For this reason Pembans have needed to import wood and charcoal while soil systems have been depleted. While living in Pemba, Jeff worked in partnership with Mbarouk Mussa Omar, a local activist to organize gardeners, tree growers and foresters in order to fight land degradation and to empower communities to sustainably manage their own resources in an economically viable way. Since 2007, CFI in partnership with CFP has launched 14 community-owned projects in Tanzania, operated by 1,800 locals, 70 percent of them women. As of May 22, 2013, over 1,000,000 trees have been planted in collaboration between farmers, local foresters, government and communities in Pemba. They have provided this community with countless help, providing access to clean water, as well as giving hope to their community.  Whaelghinbran Farm  In 2012, CFI raised over $100,000 to purchase Whaelghinbran Farm, a 580-acre farm and forest property near Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada. The land belonged to Clark Phillips and Susan Tyler, a couple who had been farming organically and restoring the forest since the early 70s. The property boasts more than 70 acres of certified organic farmland; in its early years Phillips and Tyler hosted Green Party MP Elizabeth May.https://twitter.com/ElizabethMay/statuses/209038725215289346 Through CFI, the farm is currently being used as an incubator space for the next generation of Canadian land stewards.

Cryptic female choice involves the expelling of a males sperm during or after copulations.Peretti, a V & Eberhard, W. G. Cryptic female choice via sperm dumping favours male copulatory courtship in a spider. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 23, 271–81 (2010). Male to male competition Thomisidae Misumena vatia Nephila clavipes Size is a factor in the reproductive success of males with species such as Stegodyphus lineatus, Argiope aurantia and Argyroneta aquatica showing sexual dimorphism, beneficial for larger males, stronger and more aggressive, who fight off the smaller ones using their large chelicerae and forelegs.Tedore, C. & Johnsen, S. Weaponry, color, and contest success in the jumping spider Lyssomanes viridis. Behavioural processes 89, 203–11 (2012). This leads to a decrease in the paternal success for smaller males since they are unable to gain access to females.Maklakov, A. a. & Lubin, Y. Indirect genetic benefits of polyandry in a spider with direct costs of mating. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 61, 31–38 (2006). In Argiope aurantia males can lose legs in combat, with the loss more prevalent in smaller males, evidence that larger males are favored in male-to-male competition. In the water spider Argyroneta aquatica, where males and females permanently live in the waterSchutz, D. & Taborsky, M. Sexual Selection in the Water Spider: Female Choice and Male-Male Competition. Ethology 117, 1101–1110 (2011). the males are larger, indicating sexual selective pressures for large body size. The large male water spiders are more mobile, helping them obtain more females. Sexual selection provides benefits to smaller male spiders under certain conditions, such as Misumena vatia and Nephila clavipes, whose smaller males climb faster to reach their mates:Moya- Laraño, J., Vinković, D., Allard, C. M. & Foellmer, M. W. Optimal climbing speed explains the evolution of extreme sexual size dimorphism in spiders. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 22, 954–63 (2009).Moya-laraño, A. J., Halaj, J. & Wise, D. H. Climbing to Reach Females : Romeo Should be Small. 56, 420–425 (2001). Explained by the gravity hypothesis, outcompeting larger males thus having more reproductive success, especially when females live in high patches of flowers, whereas females live in low lying areas, larger males are favored. In spiders like Tetragnathidae, Araneidae, Thomisidae and Pholicidae there is an optimal body size that favors climbing speed. Smaller males will have an advantage over the largest males of the species, however the smallest male will not be the fastest climber. This optimal body size for climbing is observed in different males from the same species express phenotypes, weapons such as chelicerae, teeth or even legs to fight off competition are used to fight off oncoming rivals, with larger bodied spiders contained larger chelicerae. In most cases body size correlated with mating success. This is observed in Lysommanes viridis, whose males display weapons that are very pronounced in comparison with females and selected to help males fight off competition. The time it takes to develop is crucial to the overall fitness of a spider. This idea is true, however does not mean that larger males will always have better fitness. In Latrodectus hasselti, larger males outcompete smaller males by getting to the females web first. However, these large male spiders have long development times, meaning that the larger male will need more time before being able to copulate. Smaller males tend to have a quick development time which gives them an advantage in mating with a female. This advantage correlates with high paternal success in the species Latrodectus hasselti. Larger males are able to outcompete smaller males, but not able to mate. Smaller males risk getting outcompeted, but are more likely to have paternal success.Kasumovic, M. M. & Andrade, M.C.B.

Evolutionary Ecology Research 10, 449–462 (2008). with males acting to limit it by guarding the female or inserting parts of the male genitalia into the females reproductive organs, or using mating plugsKuntner, M., Gregorič, M., Zhang, S., Kralj-Fišer, S. & Li, D. Mating plugs in polyandrous giants: which sex produces them, when, how and why? PLoS ONE 7, e40939 (2012). which come from the males seminal fluid.Aisenberg, A. & Barrantes, G. Sexual behavior, cannibalism, and mating plugs as sticky traps in the orb weaver spider Leucauge argyra (Tetragnathidae). Die Naturwissenschaften 98, 605–13 (2011). This process is observed in the species Unicorn catleyi, for example. In this species, males plug a females insemination duct with a portion of their palp that contains the ejaculatory duct called the embolus. The embolus that is found in the female's posterior receptaculum suggests that males are trying to limit sperm competition. In some spider species, such as the Nephila pilipes, multiple males try to mate with only one female. This can be harmful to the female, because it forces her to participate in energy costly matings. In response to this polyandry, the female produces mating plugs of her own to prevent too many males from copulating with her. The mating plugs transferred to females by the males are believed to be a possible cause of monogyny. For example, in the spider species Argiope aurantia, males will sometimes plug a female with both pedipalps to prevent sperm competition. When this occurs, the male loses his ability to mate with more than one female. Mate choice Phidippus putnami male Mate choice is typically displayed by females, but males can be choosy as well. Traits associated with winning competitive bouts are more likely to be chosen by females. As body size effects male-to-male competition, females will choose the male with the more efficient body size. A Wolf spider, Schizocosa floridana, females assess males based on their ability to cope with a changing environment, observing the way males adapt to differences in food availabilities at different times. Males who are able to adapt to the changes in food availability are well conditioned and usually show courtship displays such as tapping on their forelegs and waving. females choose the males who express these courtship displays and are larger in size based on predictions of the males foraging past. Courtship displays are commonly expressed in individuals of a species to display are signals used to attract the opposite sex, such as degrees of ornamentations, colors and movements. The male Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata spider displays certain signals, known as drumming, where a male taps his legs on a rough surface such as a leaf to signal he is ready to mate,Kotiaho, J., Alatalo, R. V, Mappes, J. & Parri, S. SEXUAL SELECTION IN A WOLF SPIDER : MALE DRUMMING ACTIVITY, BODY SIZE, AND VIABILITY. 50, 1977–1981 (1996). with its speed influencing female choice towards faster drummers. Once the females chooses the male, her body starts to shake, a signal that she is ready to mate too. Males who exhibit better drumming behavior typically are more viable. Schizocosa stridulan males have ornamentation traits in their forelegsHebets, E. A., Stafstrom, J. A., Rodriguez, R. L. & Wilgers, D. J. Enigmatic ornamentation eases male reliance on courtship performance for mating success. Animal Behaviour 81, 963–972 (2011). which affect their mating success. When courtship rates are high, ornamentation does not increase the reproductive rates of males because of the correlation between the aggressiveness of a spider and the degrees of ornamentation. Due to this correlation it is hypothesized that females choose males without ornamentation to avoid aggression from the males. Females are able to be choosy when courtship rates are high because they do not have to worry about missing out on copulations if there are plenty of male spiders to mate with. When courtship rates are low, males with high degrees of ornamentation are able to get to the female more quickly, thus giving them an advantage over non ornamented males. Sometimes facial color or leg brightness can play a role in mate choice. In several species of jumping spiders, including Habronattus pyrrithrix, and Cosmophasis umbratica, males show different brightness and color of body parts prior to copulation.Taylor, L. a., Clark, D. L. & McGraw, K. J. Condition dependence of male display coloration in a jumping spider (Habronattus pyrrithrix). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 65, 1133–1146 (2010). These colors can be used to the males advantage in attracting a mate. In the species Habronattus pyrrithrix, the males who have faces that are red and non bright green legs are more likely to attract a mate than males who do not, indicating that females prefer males with those particular traits. Although females from the species, Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata, Schizocosa floridana and Schizocosa stridulans tend to be the choosier sex, it is not uncommon to observe males from different spider species such as the Zygiella x-notata and Latrodectus hesperus, to be choosy as well.Bel-Venner, M. C., Dray, S., Allainé, D., Menu, F. & Venner, S. Unexpected male choosiness for mates in a spider. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 275, 77–82 (2008).Johnson, J. C., Trubl, P., Blackmore, V. & Miles, L. Male black widows court well-fed females more than starved females: silken cues indicate sexual cannibalism risk. Animal Behaviour 82, 383–390 (2011). In the orb weaving spider Zygiella x-notata, reproduction rates are affected by male choice under different conditions. These external conditions depend on the amount of competition between males of the species. When competition rates are low, males mate opportunistically with as many females as possible. When competition between males is high, larger males choose to mate with a large female as opposed to the smaller males who choose to mate with any female. The belief is that the advantages of larger size in competition, will give the larger males an opportunity to increase their paternal success by allowing them to be more selective of females. Sometimes males choose females who are large and better conditioned to avoid being eaten. Choosing a mal-nourished female can result in a male being cannibalized before copulation. Cannibalism by females is often expressed as a way for females to get nutrition from their mates after copulation.Wu, L., Zhang, H., He, T., Liu, Z. & Peng, Y. Factors influencing sexual cannibalism and its benefit to fecundity and offspring survival in the wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata (Araneae: Lycosidae). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 67, 205–212 (2012). This cannibalistic behavior by females makes males more selective with whom to mate with. The males from the species Latrodectus hesperus show high mate preference for better conditioned females. By choosing well nourished females, males are able to increase their mating success while limiting their chance of being consumed. This is because well nourished females are less likely to eat their mates than mal-nourished females. Cryptic female choice Cryptic female choice is a post-copulatory process of mate choice. This process is observed in numerous spider species such as, Physocyclus globosus and Argiope bruennichi.Schneider, J. M. & Lesmono, K. Courtship raises male fertilization success through post-mating sexual selection in a spider. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 276, 3105–11 (2009). For example in the Argiope bruennichi species, males produce energetic courtship displays prior to copulation. Regardless of the displays, females are observed to mate with multiple males. Once copulation is over the offspring of the female is more likely to have the courtship display phenotype than not. The females of this species must be cryptically discarding sperm from the non courtship males while keeping the other males sperm for copulation. This allows females to mate with as many males as she wants prior to copulation, while being more choosy of males after copulation. Discarding the sperm of a male who does not perform courtship displays indicates that females feel that males who perform courtship displays have the greatest fitness.

He won the first runnings of both the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas and was the first jockey to win all five of the British Classics. Early life Clift was born at Wentworth Park, Yorkshire, on the estate of the Marquess of Rockingham. As a young boy, he worked as a shepherd on the estate. His start in racing came during one of the Marquess's house parties, when the host decided to organise a pony race. As the race was short of riders, Clift was conscripted to ride for a Mr Fowlston. Clift won the race convincingly and Rockingham invited him to join his private stable, under the guidance of trainer Christopher Scaife. When Scaife moved the stable to Newmarket, Clift moved too. Career Clift rode for many wealthy patrons, including the Duke of Dorset, Duke of Grafton and Duke of Portland. His first Classic win came for Sir Ferdinand Poole on Waxy in the 1793 Derby. Seven years later, he got a second Derby win on Champion, although he missed the St. Leger win on the same horse. In 1803, he won a third Derby on Ditto. He won the first of two Oaks for the Duke of Grafton on Pelisse in 1804 and the second on Morel in 1808. Clift notably won the inaugural runnings of both the Newmarket Classics – the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas. On both occasions he was riding for Christopher Wilson. He returned to his roots for his 1807 St. Leger victory, riding for the Earl Fitzwilliam, who had inherited the Wentworth estate from his uncle. It was also the only Classic he won for his old trainer, Christopher Scaife. He continued to ride on a retainer from the Earl, before later becoming trainer to him, with his son Thomas as assistant. His last classic came on Tiresias in 1819. On retirement, he had three pensions – £30 a year from the Earl Fitzwilliam, £50 a year from the Duke of Portland and £50 from Christopher Wilson. Aged 80, he would walk from Newmarket to Bury St. Edmunds and back, \\"just to give my legs a stretch\\". Riding style Clift has been described as \\"a rider of singularly little polish...

History Stafford was born in Miami, and attended St. Thomas University, where she graduated with a degree in communication arts in 1993. She later graduated from the St. Thomas University School of Law in 1999, and later worked as an attorney. Stafford also worked for Congresswoman Carrie P. Meek as a legislative aide.

In a crowded, nine candidate field, she narrowly lost to former State Representative James Bush by 132 votes, receiving 27% of the vote to Bush's 28%. Two years later, Bush declined to run again, so that he could instead run for Congress, and Stafford ran to succeed him.

His grandfather, also a brewer, was one of the first Calvinists in the city and involved in the Siege of Haarlem. Biography Michiel was the son of the wealthy Haarlem brewer and burgomaster Jan Michielsz de Wael (1557–1618) and Cornelia Anthonisdr Juyst.

He was painted yet again by Pieter Claesz Soutman in the same role in 1644. For a long time this painting was dated 1640, but the striking similarity of his face with the version from 1627 and especially his dress has recently led art historians to conclude that this painting was probably a wedding pendant. He married Cunera van Baersdorp (Leiden 1600-Haarlem 1640), who was the daughter of a mayor of Leiden, on 22 April 1625 and this portrait probably dates from that time, as does his wife's pendant.Marieke de Winkel,\\"Frans Hals’s Portraits of Michiel de Wael and Cunera van Baersdorp and of Jan de Wael and Aeltje Dircksdr Pater identified\\" in: Face Book: studies on Dutch and Flemish Portraiture of the 16th–18th Centuries, The Hague 2012, pp. 141–149 They were married exactly a half year after Cunera's mother died. That explains the bride's wedding dress in half mourning (a black skirt, white gloves and black and white bracelets but with lace). In 1656 their 18-year-old, youngest daughter Josina married the 32-year-old Alkmaar writer Sierik Siersma in Haarlem.

As it crumbles, or gets patched up, much of what was built in Central Asia is the backbone of the existing infrastructure for transportation, goods delivery and energy distribution. Much of the industrial infrastructure underwent precipitous decline in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, especially in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The roads, railroads and energy lines are thus oriented towards the Russian Federation and away from other regional neighbors, such as China, Afghanistan or Iran. Soviet steam locomotive Tashkent  Railroad Transportation  The Central Asian railroad network was designed primarily with the needs of former Soviet Union planners in mind. The entire Soviet railways system was built with Moscow at its core. Consequently, Central Asian railroads are mainly oriented north-south and (now-existing) borders were disregarded in planning. As a result, virtually all freight cargo from Central Asia to Russia crosses Kazakhstan, including trade with Europe. Uzbekistan also has significant transit traffic.Central Asia: Decay and Decline. p. 34 Major Soviet Railroads, 1986 The total length of the rail network in the four CARs is about 19,600 kilometers (km) but size varies by country. * Kazakhstan has about 14,600 km of main line of which 37% are double-track and 28% are electrified. * Uzbekistan has about 4,000 km including the 400 km of new line constructed in the last 2–3 years. About 150 km are double track and about 10% are electrified. * The other Central Asian countries are mostly single track and not electrified. In 2004, main lines consisted of 426 km in the Kyrgyz Republic mostly in the north, and 533 km in Tajikistan including 106 km in the north.  Soviet Rail Management  During the Soviet era, railways of the Central Asian countries were under the auspices of the Ministry of Railways, separated regionally into: Diesel- locomotive shunter TEM-7 # Alma-Ata Railway Bureau (southern Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan) # Tselinnaya Railway Bureau (northern Kazakhstan) # West- Kazakhstan Railway Bureau # Central Asian Railway Bureau (entire Central Asian region excluding Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan) The Kazakh Railroad is one of the 7 divisions of the Southern Urals Railroad. It was formed in 1958 out of the Turkestan-Siberian and Karaganda railroads and sections of the former Tashkent, Orenburg, and Southern Urals railroads.Prohorov (1976). 11: 501 The principal trunk line connected Kazakhstan to the Urals and the Volga region. The Kinel'-Orenburg-Iletsk trunk line connected the European regions of the USSR with Kazakhstan and the rest of Central Asia. The principal commodities transported were coal (22%), ferrous metals (12%), oil (10%), and building materials (9%). The Southern Urals Railroad was awarded the Order of the October Revolution in 1971.Prokhorov (1978). 30: 658 In 1971, this railroad had 13,250 km of track, representing 9% of the total rail network of the USSR. While some of the lines were built in 1915-17, 80% of the lines were built in the Soviet period. In 1971, the Kazakh Railroad was awarded the Order of Lenin. After independence, each country nationalized and progressively took control of their own railways. Kazakhstan's three companies were merged into a single one in 1997.Prakash. p. 21 Due to the specialization in the railway manufacturing sector under the COMECON regime (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance – the Soviet international assistance framework), most passenger cars were made in East Germany, locomotives were made in Russia and Czechoslovakia. As there are no railroad locomotive or car manufacturers in Central Asia, there is a constant shortage of spare parts and an inability to properly maintain railroad vehicles.RIDA. p. 113 In the USSR, the power supply system of an electric railroad is closely tied to the overall power system. Electricity arrives from substations in high-voltage power transmission lines, is converted, and then transmitted over feed and negative booster lines to the contact system and then to the rolling stock. Depending on the equipment in the rolling stock, the power may be supplied over DC systems using single- phase systems at the commercial frequency (50 hertz) or lower (16 2/3 or 25 Hz). The DC systems in the USSR had a nominal voltage of 3 kilovolts.Prohorov (1978). 30: 613 In 1956, the Central Committee of the Soviet Union adopted the General Plan for the Electrification of Railroads - after which major rail routes were upgraded.  Rail gauge  Bishkek rail overpass Rail gauge in former Soviet territory differs from the gauge in the rest of the world. Rail tracks in the former Soviet territories are on a broad-gauge track of 1,524 millimeters (60 inches) versus the global standard gauge of 1,435 millimeters used in China, most of Europe, North America, most of Australia, Iran and Turkey. The Russian Empire and the Soviet Union intentionally used a different gauge (ostensibly to block invaders from entering Russia by rail). Consequently, trains on the current rail line from China to Kazakhstan must stop at the border, where cargo is unloaded and then reloaded onto trains on the broad-gauge rail line in Kazakhstan for transit through Central Asia. During Soviet times, locomotives and wagons were regularly supplied on the basis of estimated needs. When the Soviet Union broke up, shares of the Soviet wagon fleet were allocated to the various republics; the smaller ones did not get the better deals. As a feature of the Soviet system, state-owned rail companies provide provided social welfare services such as free education and housing to their workers. After independence, each country had to figure out how to address these obligations (without Soviet funding). In Soviet times, marketing was not a concern for railways since their clients were for the most part assigned to them by a central planning agency. To increase revenues after independence, railways had either to find more clients or to increase tariffs.  Rail prominence and decline  The new railways faced difficulties adopting monolithic organizations with large social welfare burdens and aging equipment. # The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan started national railways from scratch as they were left with only branches of Soviet companies. # The railways changed from a command economy in which the only client was the state to a market economy with many clients, each with its own requirements and free to choose another, more suitable transport mode. # Networks were not designed with a national economy in mind and were poorly connected often necessitating crossing borders to travel between regions of a country. # There was a sharp fall in traffic volume, which has started picking up since 1999. In the CIS, an inter-governmental agreement was signed as early as 14 February 1992. This organization coordinates the operations and development of the railways and has facilitated several important agreements on tariffs.Prakash. p. 18 Regional traffic in Central Asia is overwhelmingly carried by rail, estimated at 90%.Otsuka. p. 48 For trade within Central Asia, roadways carry only 22% of all goods.Prakash. p. 8 The Kazak railway, via Kzyl-Orda and Aralsk, has traditionally provided the main connection between Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic and between European Russia and Northern Europe and now provides a route to the Caspian Sea port of Aktau. The railway in Uzbekistan via Navoi and Nukus and then through Makat in Kazakhstan provides a link between southern Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan to western Siberia. It also provides an alternative east-west link to the Kzyl-Orda-Aralsk route via Aktau.Prakash. p. 10 In the 1990s a sharp decrease in traffic led to a period of large surpluses when only the best wagons were used. Many of the worst were either scrapped or cannibalized to maintain the others. At the time of independence, the number of freight wagons in Kazakhstan was estimated to be 128,000. In 2001, the number was down to 78,000. Of those, at least 30% and probably more were out of service. About 43% of the remaining wagons were over 20 years old.Prakash. p. 24  Rail Border Concerns  The Soviet Union built rail lines that stop at the former Soviet boundary. Thus, out of five Central Asian countries, only Kazakhstan (with China at Dostyk/Druzhba- Alashankou) and Turkmenistan (with Iran at Serakhs) have rail connections beyond the CIS. The railways connect northern Kazakhstan with Russia along the northern Trans-Asian Railway (TAR). Initially planned in 1954, construction began in the 1950s but was not completed until 1990. Freight trains began running in July 1991, followed by passenger trains linking Almaty and Ürümqi (in Xinjiang) in June 1992.Otsuka. p. 43 The Serakhs station that links the Russian gauge Turkmen network to the standard gauge Iranian network opened in 1996 for transit - to Iran and Turkey.RIDA. p. 12 This line connects to the Iranian railway system but it does not carry freight to the Persian Gulf, thus preventing a direct link between Central Asia and seafaring routes.Otsuka. p. 49 Thus, numerous underlying cross-border problems are at the root of the difficulties of regional rail transport. A lack of track-sharing agreements means that a single operator moving goods through two or more countries is not feasible. This causes time-consuming and costly border operations - trains have to change locomotives and crews at each border crossing. There is no system of sealing wagons (like under the TIR Convention) to avoid the need for customs inspections at borders or within transit countries.Prakash. p. 23 There is also a lack of regional uniform customs and other border controls that comply with international best practices, which makes documentation delays much more likely. Cargo documentation is often complicated with separate weigh bills for each country traversed; any documentation problem can result in the wagon being detained for several days. \\"The aging of the locomotive fleet does not imply a shortage in the short-term; the problem is rather obsolescence.\\"  Road Transportation  Taldyk pass (3600 m) The relatively small populations, large land areas (particularly in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) and difficult mountainous terrain (especially in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) increase infrastructure costs and pose challenges to maintenance of road infrastructure in Central Asia. The total road length under central government management (roads considered national highway) in Central Asia is 59,430 km, almost all of which is paved.Prakash. p. 12 There are significant seasonal variations in road use due to the transportation of fresh agricultural products. Almost all food products are carried by road transport from south to north, particularly during the warmer months.  Soviet Road Building  see also Transport in the Soviet Union In the USSR, five technical categories of highways existed, depending on the relation of the highway to the country's total transportation system and on the estimated traffic. The higher the estimated traffic, the higher the category of road (150 km/hr for Category 1 down to 60 km/hr for Category 5).Prokhorov (1973). 1: 623 The Soviet highways were differentiated into: * All-Union highways: provided interrepublic transportation and connected capitals of the republics with each other and major economic centers. They also serve international transportation lines, airports, and health resorts of all-Union significance.Prokhorov (1973). 1: 625 * Republic highways: provided transportation between oblasts and connected railroad stations and harbors as well as providing access to all-Union highways. * Oblast highways: connected oblast centers with cities and important industrial and agricultural centers. * Local highways: provided transportation between raion centers and connected to outlying settlements, sovkhozes and kolhozes. * Department highways: highways under the jurisdiction of individual ministries (such as forestry, metallurgy, etc.). In Central Asia, the major highways which were built include: * Alma-Ata - Frunze - Tashkent (812 km): This highway was built from 1957 to 1965. It was the chief highway of southern Kazakhstan, passing through Dzhambul and Shimkent.Prokhorov (1973). 1: 626 * Tashkent - Termez (708 km): Built in 1940 with substantial reconstruction in the 1960s. This highway was called the Lenin Road. It passed through Guliston and Samarkand. Together with the aforementioned highway, it formed USSR Route 36. * Frunze - Osh (605 km): Built from 1956 to 1965 this was the main highway of the Kyrgyz Republic connecting the northern and southern oblasts of the republic. : On this highway, the largest highway tunnel in the USSR was built at an altitude of 3,200 meters stretching 2.5 km long. * Osh - Khorog (701 km): Called the Pamir Road, this highway was built from 1931 to 1934. This route allowed transport to the Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast. Together with the aforementioned highway this route formed USSR Route 37. Some stretches of the route are at elevations above 4,000 meters, including the Taldy Pass (see photo).  Soviet road publications  Automotive Roads (Avtomobil'nye Dorogi) was a monthly industrial and technical magazine published by the Ministry of Transport Construction. It was published in Moscow beginning in 1954, dealing with questions of planning, building, repairing and maintaining highways.Prokhorov (1973). 1: 535 Automotive Transport (Avotmobil'nyi Transport) was a monthly manufacturing and technical publication published by the Ministry of Motor Vehicle Transportation and Highways and the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Employees of Motor Vehicle Transportation and Highways. Published in Moscow starting in 1923, it highlighted problems in organization shipments and vehicular transportation, design and repair of vehicles, training of employees and traffic safety, along with transportation abroad.  Modern Road Infrastructure  In particular, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are landlocked and heavily dependent on roads for trade and commerce. Their mountainous terrain makes transportation challenging and expensive.\\"When it comes to the main road corridors, both governments plan to continue relying on big international and bilateral partners for aid in transportation construction. In Kyrgyzstan international organisations have invested over $400 million to rehabilitate 1,600km of roads between 1995 and 2008. China's Export Import Bank is the largest investor in the transportation infrastructure of Tajikistan…\\" Central Asia: Decay and Decline. p. 17 In Tajikistan, Japan's development agency is building a road south from the capital. Typically, these investments are scattershot and targeted towards road infrastructure that can potentially carry international cargo. Following the Soviet legacy, they are also typically oriented along the north-south axis. The north-south road through eastern Kazakhstan (via Almaty and Aktogay) provides an important link between the Kyrgyz Republic (and Uzbekistan to a lesser extent) and eastern Siberia. The north-south road through Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, links Kazakhstan and Xinjiang to Afghanistan and ports in Iran and Pakistan. Pamir highway near Karakul In Turkmenistan, which does not receive as much foreign aid but has substantial natural gas reserves, the Soviet system of management has largely remained in place. Five separate ministries are in charge of specific segments of the transportation sector. The government has not developed any master plan on road improvements, so upgrades do not take into account traffic volume, future building or maintenance costs.Central Asia: Decay and Decline. p. 27 Poor road conditions are caused by overloading vehicles and a lack of preventive maintenance, due to funding constraints.Prakash. p. 13 Much maintenance and repair is dependent on bilateral aid or is done piecemeal.  International Road Linkages  All Central Asian Republics are members of the International Road Union, which assists with implementation of international road transport agreements. In general, China does not participate in these broad multilateral agreements; however, it has made smaller-scale agreements. Most notable among those are the Transit Transport Agreement (PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Pakistan on March 9, 1995) and the Agreement on International Road Transport (PRC, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan on 19 February 1998).  Energy Infrastructure  Kurpsai Hydroelectric Station, Kyrgyzstan In the Soviet era, the United Energy System of Central Asia (UESCA) provided for the exchange of water and energy between the five Central Asian states. When the Soviet Union collapsed, these countries quickly discovered that their new, disconnected grids had significant gaps.Central Asia: Decay and Decline. p. 10 Under the arrangement prevalent during the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan would supply water for irrigation purposes to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in summer. In winter Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan would supply gas to Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to cover their heating needs. UESCA began falling apart in 2003 when Turkmenistan declared its exit from the system. With the disintegration of Soviet-era sharing agreements, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are facing drastic shortages in power supply. The winter shortage in Tajikistan is 500 MW.  Hydroelectric Power  Until the 1950s, the USSR focused its hydroelectric construction in the European part of the Union, which was responsible for 65% of the hydroelectrical output of the USSR.Prokhorov (1975). 6: 663 In subsequent decades, significant construction was taken up in the Volga, Far East and Central Asian rivers. The Toktogul Hydroelectric Power Plant is located on the Naryn River in Osh oblast. The plant began operating in 1975 with 1,200 Megawatts capacity. It has a dam that is 215 meters high. The dam forms the Toktogul Reservoir which began filling in 1974. The reservoir covers 284 square km. The reservoir regulates the flow of the Naryn River, allowing for the irrigation of 0.5 million hectares of land.Prokhorov (1977). 26: 204 Construction of the Nurek Hydroelectric Power Plant began on the Vahsh River near Nurek, Tadzhik SSR in 1961. The dam is 300m high, with a volume of 56 million cubic meters. Electric power from the dam supplied the unified power grid of Central Asia through transmission lines operating at 500 and 220 kilovolts. The planned capacity was 2,700 Megawatts. The reservoir formed by the dam began filling in 1972, with an area of 98 square kilometers. It provided seasonal regulation of water flow and made possible the irrigation of 1 million hectares of land in the Karshi and Kzyl-Kum steppes and the Dangara Plateau.Prokhorov (1974). 18: 337 The Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Plant is located on the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan. It had an established capacity of 675 megawatts, with construction beginning in 1953, operating at full capacity in 1966. The dam height is 80 meters, forming the Bukhtarma Reservoir and providing electricity to east Kazakhstan. The reservoir began filling in 1960 with an area of 5,500 square km. It allows for irrigation of hundreds of thousands of acres of floodplains in several oblasts.Prokhorov (1970). 4: 167 The USSR built some of the highest dams in the world, with Nurek as the highest.

The Tajik Aluminium Company consumes between 40 and 50 per cent of all electricity and pays the lowest tariff in the country. The government argues that both sectors are crucial sources of revenue. After gaining independence in 1991 Kazakhstan moved to address strategic vulnerabilities of the energy system. At the time the northern part of the country was linked with the Russian grid, while southern regions draw their supply from the unified regional system. By building two north-south transmission lines (one in 1997 and the other in 2009) the country connected its southern territories to major sources of energy in the north and decreased dependence on its neighbours.Central Asia: Decay and Decline. p. 33 In the Kyrgyz Republic, the gate price of heating oil is $50 per ton at the refinery in the south of the country.

The type species, audeti, was named after Roy Audet allowing access to his ranch leading to the discovery of the species. The discovery of this specimen lead to several new revelations in the fossil records questioning the preservation of small-bodied organisms along with the evolution of early pachycephalosaurs. The iconic cranial dome found on Acrotholus makes it the earliest indisputable known member of the pachycephalosaur family. Like others of its clade, Acrotholus was a bipedal herbivore characterized by a dome-shaped head. The dome had often been associated with intra-species combat though exact method of contact have been debated.  History of discovery  The holotype was found in the Deadhorse Coulee Member of the Milk River Formation in Southern Alberta, Canada. This formation has been known to expose organisms from the Late Santonian. The fossil consists of a nearly complete frontoparietal dome along with the anterior half of the frontoparietal dome. Pachycephalosaurs in general are unique in dinosaur fossil records due to their relatively small size in relation to most dinosaurs in their time period, 40 kg or less. It has been suggested due to smaller bone being susceptible to destruction by carnivores and weathering, preservation bias exist for smaller species. Pachycephalosaurs are unique in this regard due to their recognizable head dome which is resistant towards pre-depositional destruction. Among known fossil specimens, approximately 66% are known from only cranial remains. Acrotholus' discovery further implicates the diversity of small bodied dinosaurs which may not have survived the fossil record, suggesting a much more complex ecology in the late Mesozoic era. A similar conclusion have been made with Asian species of pachycephalosaurs, with their ontogeny under debate due to their flat domed shapes.  Description   Skull  Unlike most known pachycephalosaurs, A. audeti's dome on the skull is oval in shape having a maximum thickness of above the cerebral fossa. The lack of tesserae or tubercles indicate the specimen was past the juvenile stage of its development. Computed tomography (CT) scans reveal a low vascularity, high density, and fully fused internally fused frontal-frontal and frontoparietal sutures. Peripheral bones are high and well developed on the dome indicating the peripherals were incorporated within the dome. The incorporation of supraorbitals in the dome are similar if not greater than more derived pachycephalosaur. Compared to Stegoceras validum and later Campanian pachycephlosaurids, the dorsally convex frontonasal boss is short and not separated with grooves from the anterior supraorbital lobe. This region is approximately 50% of the thickness to the cerebral fossa (55 mm). Orbital fosse are only slightly concave and pierced by small foramina. Three depression can be seen on the ventral surface of the frontoparietal dome, the orbital cavity, endocranial fossa, and temporal fossa. Comparisons of the skull finds A. audeti to be distinctly different from other pachycephalosaurs in relation to dome. Most notably, the supraorbital region and incorporation of the supraorbital into the dome identify the specimen from other pachycephalosaurs. Very little soft tissue covering have been suggested over the dome due to the structural anatomy and hypothesized use.  Phylogeny  A. audeti is a sister taxon to Prenocephale prenes and Wanannosaurus. Acrotholus is the earliest known specimen of pachycephalosaur with derived traits from the fossil records, predating later known species of flat headed species in Asia. The discovery of this species further suggests pachycephalosaur head features were well established by the Santonian predating later species thought to have primitive traits such as Homalocephale and Stegoceras validum. Below is a cladogram modified from Evans et al., 2013.  Paleobiology   Growth  The relatively dome shape of the holotype indicates the specimen was an adult or nearing its completion of its adult transition. Consolidation between flat headed and domed pachycephalosaurs have been greatly debated. Fossils records from more numerous North American specimen suggest a flat domed juvenile stages. Juvenile Pachycephalosaurs wyomingensis have characteristics of nodes on the squamosal nearly identical to holotype fossils of Dracorex hogwartsia and Stygimoloch spinifer. A spike like node on the posteroventral region of the jugal match with that of D. hogwartsia. Such similarities with confirmed juvenile P. wyonmingensis and flat headed species from North America support their recognition as P. wyonmingensis and the ontogenic relationship in growth stages. Comparison of bone development in flat domed taxa from Asia have found patterns indicating active growth at the time of death. Closer analysis of related taxa, Stegoceras novomexicanium found holotype specimen to be juvenile in characteristics, with visible frontal-parietal sutures, small rounded tubercles on the dome, and vascularized internal skull bones. Another Asian taxa, Homalocephale calathocercos was also found exhibit juvenile characteristics in the fossil holotype though it has been proposed some species of pachycephalosaur exhibit pedomorphism.  Behavior  The most notable physiology of A. audeti is the fused frontal and parietal skull forming a thickened dome structure. The lack of comparative living comparative morphology have led to various theories on the function of the structure. Two accepted hypotheses have been proposed to explain the appearance of the cranial dome. One of the hypotheses suggest the dome plays a visual roles, either for sexual display or species recognition. However, such theories have been countered due to the relatively large energy investment required and the morphological changes that occur in the species life span. The more widely accepted and popular hypothesis explains the dome being used as a weapon. In modern species with analogous structures, such head ornaments have been use between intra-species combat. Analysis on dome of the more widely known specimen Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis have some pathologies in the dome mirroring those of modern-day mammals exhibiting intra-species contact. In P. wyomingensis and other examined pachycephalosaur skulls, chronic osteomyelitis was observed, a pathology often associated with combat. Several skull specimens show various lesions with healing suggesting survival after contact. Flat headed individuals saw little cranial damage supporting their juvenile stage ontogeny. Comparison with extinct and extent species that were known to engage in infra-specific combat have found the formation of lesions to be consistent with their use. Morphological comparisons with modern ungulates practicing head butting have found similar dome shaped structures used in combat. The cancellous region found in head striking artiodactyls have been considered to be covering the domes of pachycephalosaur to aid in protection against head impacts. In addition, tubular struts in the dome of the related taxa, Stegoceras, were comparable to pneumatized frontal sinuses found in some head-stricking mammals. Modern archosaurs such as Ostriches and crocodiles exhibit similar ranges of pathologies due to intra-species combat.  Paleoecology  Analysis of pachycephalosaurid skull by Mallon and Evans, suggest many species frequently inhibited coastal area contrary to their terrestrial life style. In the same study, it was concluded that North American pachycephalosaurids lived in habitats near flood plains and coastal plains. Hindlimb proportions have been found to be similar to other modern animals such as moose and various wading birds that inhibit wetland areas. The Milk River Formation, where A. audeti is found, is home to many other extinct species in the late Cretaceous including other dinosaurs like Saurornitholestes and mammals like Alphadon.

History Raschein was born in Anchorage, Alaska, and moved to the state of Florida in 1999 when she started at Florida State University, where she graduated with a degree in political science in 2003. During her time as an undergraduate, she began working as at Robert M. Levy & Associates, a state government relations firm in Tallahassee. After her graduation, Raschein began working as a legislative aide for Republican State Representative Ken Sorensen. When Representative Sorensen was unable to seek another term in the Legislature in 2006 and Democratic Judge Ron Saunders was elected to replace him, Raschein continued working in the office, despite the fact that Representative Saunders was a Democrat. Florida House of Representatives In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the State's Legislative Districts and following Representative Saunders's decision to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, an open seat occurred in the reformatted 120th District. Raschein opted to run for the seat, and faced Former Key West Mayor Morgan McPherson, the 2010 Nominee, in the Republican Primary. She was able to defeat Mayor McPherson comfortably, winning 66% of the vote to his 34%, and advanced to the General Election, where she faced Ian Whitney, the Democratic Nominee. Over the course of the campaign, the two candidates staked out positions in opposition to each other. Raschein supported private school vouchers while Whitney did not; Whitney supported the expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while Raschein opposed it, noting, \\"I am all for health care. But I don't know how the states are going to be able to pay for the expansion of Medicaid. The devil is in the details. How are we going to pay for that? We don't want to cut education anymore, social services can't be cut anymore. I am concerned about how we are going to fund it.\\" Despite the competitive nature of the election, Raschein and Whitney maintained mutual respect and kindness for each other, with Whitney noting that the two of them got along \\"very well\\" and Raschein calling her opponent \\"a very nice guy.\\" Ultimately, Raschein narrowly defeated Whitney, winning her first term with 52% of the vote to his 48%. In doing so Raschein followed in the footsteps of her great-grandfather Representative Hartley Hendrick Hethcox, who served in the Florida House of Representatives in the 1940s and was a County Commissioner in Lake County. During the 2013 legislative session, Representative Raschein sponsored legislation that aimed to protect stray cats, creating \\"protected cat colonies where the glut of strays scavenging for food and shelter could be trapped, neutered or spayed, then released to fend for themselves,\\" and worked with Democratic State Representative Joe Saunders to author legislation that \\"adds sexual orientation and 'gender identity' to the list of characteristics against which private businesses cannot discriminate in the provision of employment or services.\\" In the 2014 legislative session, Representative Raschein worked to renew funding for a \\"state tax incentive program that entices film and television productions,\\" which benefitted several television series filming in the Florida Keys, but the legislative session ran out before the bill could be considered. She noted, \\"There were a lot of differing opinions [in the legislature] on how we as a state should support the film and television industry. It kind of got held up in the process. It wasn't a priority and that's unfortunate.\\" She also worked with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and State Senator Greg Evers to author legislation that banned the importation of lionfish into the state, as the fish is an invasive species that has a detrimental effect on local ecosystems. In 2014, Representative Raschein was re-elected to her second term in the legislature without opposition, and in 2016, she won again with 57.3% of the vote.

The Rio Grande Rise, also called the Rio Grande Elevation, is an aseismic ocean ridge in the southern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brazil. Together with the Walvis Ridge off Africa, the Rio Grande Rise forms a V-shaped structure of mirrored hotspot tracks or seamount chains across the northern South Atlantic. In 2013, Brazilian scientists announced that they found granite boulders on the Rio Grande Rise and speculated that it could be the remains of a submerged continent, which they called the \\"Brazilian Atlantis\\". Other researchers, however, noted that such boulders can end-up on the ocean floor by less speculative means. Geology The Rio Grande Rise separates the Santos and Pelotas Basins and is composed of western and eastern areas, which have different geological backgrounds. The western area has numerous guyots and seamounts and a basement dated to . The eastern area is covered by fracture zones and may represent an abandoned spreading centre. In the western area, volcanic breccia and layers of ash indicate widespread volcanism during the Eocene, which coincides with the formation of volcanic rocks onshore. During this period, parts of the western plateau were uplifted over sea level and short-lived volcanic islands formed. When West Gondwana (i.e. South America) broke away from Africa during the Early Cretaceous (), the South Atlantic opened up from its southern to its northern end. In this process, the voluminous Paraná and Etendeka continental flood basalts formed in what is now Brazil and Namibia. This event is linked to the Tristan-Gough hotspot, now located near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, close to Tristan da Cunha and the Gough Islands. During the Maastrichtian (), the orientation of spreading changed, which is still visible on the African side, and volcanism ended on the American side. This process resulted in the Tristan-Gough seamount chains on either side of the Tristan-Gough hotspot. Palaeoclimatic role A Brazilian-Japanese expedition in 2013 recovered in situ granitic and metamorphic rocks on the Rio Grande Rise. This can possibly indicate that the plateau includes fragments of continental crust -- possible remains of micro- continents similar to those found on and around Kerguelen in the Indian Ocean and Jan Mayen in the Arctic Ocean. The existence of such microcontinents is speculative, however, since their remains tend to be covered by younger layers of lava and sediments. Nevertheless, transoceanic dispersals are hinted at by the fossil record of, for example, flightless birds such as Lavocatavis, indicating that several islands between Africa and South America made island hopping possible across the Atlantic during the Tertiary (). At the beginning of the Maastrichtian, the characteristics of water masses differed north and south of the Rio Grande Rice-Walvis Ridge complex. The disappearance of these differences during the Maastritchtian indicates a reorganisation of oceanic circulation patterns that lead to a global homogenisation of intermediate and deep waters. This process seems to have been triggered by the breaching of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge complex and the disappearance of epicontinental seaways such as the Tethys Ocean. The process resulted in the deterioration of rudist-dominated tropical habitats and consequently the extinction of benthic inoceramid bivalves. The origin of modern circulation of cold, deep water -- known as the \\"Big Flush\\" -- is associated with Early Eocene () geological events; tectonism that resulted in the opening of the north-east Atlantic and fracture zones that developed in the subsiding Rio Grande Rise, which allowed cold water from the Antarctic Weddell Sea to flow northward into the North Atlantic. , the generation of cold bottom water in the Antarctic resulted in the formation of psychrospheric fauna, which today live in temperatures below , in the Atlantic and Tethys. This global distribution suggests that the Rio Grande Rise had been breached by this time, allowing cold, dense water to move north-south through a corridor enhancing the transition from a latitudinal thermospheric circulation to a meridional thermohaline circulation.

It contains a single species, Wulatelong gobiensis. History The fossils of Wulatelong, representing a single nearly-complete skeleton, now cataloged IVPP V 18409, were discovered in 2009 in the Bayan Mandahu area of Wulatehouqi, Inner Mongolia, a fossil- rich area which has yielded many recent dinosaur discoveries. The authors of the paper describing Wulatelong had previously described the dromaeosaurid Linheraptor (2010), the maniraptorid Linhenykus (2011), and the troodontid Linhevenator (2011). Wulatelong was described by Xu et al. in 2013. The generic name derives from Wulate, where the fossils were discovered, and long, the Chinese word for \\"dragon\\". The specific name, gobiensis, refers to the Gobi Desert. Classification Wulatelong is an oviraptorid dinosaur, the sister taxon of Banji. The oviraptors were bird-like, herbivorous and omnivorous theropods characterized by toothless, parrot-like beaks, and often elaborate crests. They are known only from the Late Cretaceous of Asia. Restored skull Paleoecology Wulatelong shared their habitat in the Bayan Mandahu with a number of other dinosaurian fauna. These included the ceratopsians Protoceratops and Magnirostris, the ankylosaurian Pinacosaurus, and a number of other theropods: the dromaeosaurids Velociraptor and Linheraptor, the oviraptorosaurian Machairasaurus, the alvarezsauroid Linhenykus, and the troodontid Linhevenator. The authors of the paper describing Wulatelong concluded that the Bayan Mandahu fauna \\"differs fundamentally in composition from the classical Djadokhta fauna, perhaps because of a difference in age\\" or due to environmental factors.

Bernard and his girlfriend Lenina Disney (Marcia Strassman) go to a primitive reservation which holds to 20th century values, and while there meet a native named John (also called the Savage) (Kristoffer Tabori). They return with him to civilization, and his presence further upends conventional thinking. John is seen as a freak and this grants him some degree of celebrity. John develops romantic feelings for Lenina, which are considered highly inappropriate, bordering on the obscene. John's parents are from the more technologically advanced part of the world, and he has educated himself using often banned works such as Shakespeare. John realizes that his sexual mores, based on the works he studied, are antiquated in this advanced society. He therefore asks to be assigned a solitary posting, but even as he mans the lighthouse alone, he cannot escape his memories of Lenina.

It was built in the early 19th century to help guide shipping into the newly constructed harbour, now known as the Port of Holyhead, which acted as the terminus for the packet service between England and Ireland. It is probably the second oldest lighthouse in Wales, after Point of Ayr Lighthouse and is the last of a series of three lighthouses located on Salt Island. History The lighthouse was built as part of extensive improvements to Holyhead Harbour authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1810. The harbour was the mail packet station for packet boats crossing to Ireland, providing a postal service between Dublin and London, via Telford’s new turnpike road which was completed in 1826. Howth Harbour Lighthouse is a matching tower in Howth, Ireland, also designed by Rennie, for the other terminal of the Irish packet steamer. The lighthouse is of national significance as one of John Rennie's surviving works. He was one of the most eminent engineers of the world's first Industrial Revolution. Of particular importance, in a Welsh context, is the early date of the lighthouse lantern, which was originally lit by gas. Before the conversion to electricity a gas works was located on the island to power the lighthouse, the piers and even part of Holyhead itself. The tower survives intact and has elegantly curved gallery railings, similar to those at Bardsey Lighthouse. It is no longer in use, although it is used as a navigation reference for sailors.Holyhead Mail Pier Light Lighthouse Explorer.

M. Davidson was a Mechanical Engineering professor at Stevens Institute of Technology who helped create the Davidson Towing Tank at the institution. In 1918 he served as a pilot in the Army Air Service. Davidson was a sailor. He raced in many boat races, one in 1935 to Norway, and the America’s Cup defender, the Ranger, in 1937. Time at the Institute 1929-1935 Kenneth Seymour Moorhead Davidson joined Stevens Institute of Technology in 1929 as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering. In the fall of 1932 asked Olin J. Stephens II for help in locating a high quality model yacht for experiments. Olin gave him a model of the yacht Natka, which measured six meters long. Davidson wanted to run small scale tests, but knew that they were unreliable. Many small scale test were run, but the full scale yacht did not have the same performance. Another problem with the large scale models was they were expensive for small yacht designers to afford. Davidson believed that experiments could help break down complex problems in smaller problems that were more manageable to solve. Davidson also held the belief that only small model could provide cost effectiveness to study all boats. To prove that small crafts could be made in a way that provided good information on craft dynamics he started testing in the swimming pool at Stevens in May 1931. He created a small, portable testing device that he could use after the pool closed at night. The summer of 1931 gave Davidson results that made him take his studies to the next level. Davidson and two assistants constructed a dynamometer and a towing apparatus for more detailed and quantitative work. Since the pool was so short in length and the model they were testing so small, the slow towing speeds. The slow speeds meant that the resistances that the model experienced were also small. This led to many problems. If they were going to use these tests, they had to make sure the speed was very controlled. To meet this requirement, Davidson designed a gear box that would do just this. Early in 1932 Davidson and two students performed tests to see if scaling would be a problem. Since the tests did not produce turbulent flow it was hard to determine anything. He decided to add strips to make up the resistance. Tests with in 1932 with their small scale models and test results from large scale models proved their testing methods. In 1933 Davidson had the opportunity to test his testing methods. The tests turned out to be successful that Davidson began designing a full sized tank for testing. Davidson received the funding necessary to build his full size test pool. The pool opened on June 4, 1935. The tank measured 101 feet in length and 9 feet across and 4.5 feet deep. The tank was fitted with state of the art sensors and measuring equipment. 1935-1940 The early tests in this tank, Tank 1, were focused on how to properly model windward performance of yachts. There were two main goals from these test: to determine the relationship between the wind speed and the force on the sails, and determine the lift/drag ratio of the rig. Davidson released his results from these test in his 1936 paper \\"Some Experimental Studies of the Sailing Yacht\\". Not all of the work in Tank 1 was done on yachts. They did some tests on a steamship, which showed they had confidence in their methods. In April 1936, Davidson began testing the Ranger for the America's Cup. The yacht was designed and tested in the tank and Davidson navigated the Ranger to victory in the America's Cup. The success of this and other tests brought recognition to Davidson and his team. By 1939 they started to test many different types of boats. Davidson was then approached in 1939 to run tests on the turning of boats. Since his tank was not able to deal with turns he went back to the Stevens pool after hours. Since the pool was not suitable enough, Davidson contacted Columbia where they let him use their pool on the weekends. 1942-1945 During World War II, the entirety of the work going on in the tanks was for the war effort. The size of his team grew to 63, and Davidson hired women to help build the models. The tank was being used for almost 16 hours a day, everyday. Since Davidson wanted his own tank instead of having to go to Columbia on the weekends to run tests, he submitted a proposal for another tank. In 1942 the plan was approved and construction began on Tank 2. Tank 2 was a 75-foot square with a depth of 4.5 feet. Once the tank opened it was the world's first indoor maneuvering basin. This meant that Davidson did not have to go to Columbia to run tests on the turning abilities of boats. Like Tank 1, Tank 2 had state of the art sensors and measuring equipment. In November 1942, Davidson started to run test on seaplane hulls for the Bureau of Aeronautics. The problem was that neither of the two existing tanks were suitable for the tests needed, so a proposal for another tank was submitted. Tank 3 opened in November 1944. This tank was designed for high speed towing. Tank 3 had a length of 313 feet, was 12 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. This tank was able to tow models at speeds of up to 60 ft/sec. A wave maker was also installed to make waves of up to 8 inches tall. Once the tank opened it was flooded with tests on seaplane hulls. By 1944 45% of all the work being done in the lab was on seaplane hulls.http://archive.stevens.edu/ses/cms/fileadmin/cms/pdf/Davidson_Laboratory_and_the_Experimental_Towing_Tank_The_Hist.pdfHistory of Stevens Institute of Technology: A Record of Broad Bases Curricula and Technogenesis 1870-2000 by Geoffrey W.

The app allowed only female users to access the evaluation system, and evaluations made through the app are attached publicly and anonymously. The New York Times described the service as a \\"'Take Back the Internet' moment for young women who have come of age in an era of revenge porn and anonymous, possibly ominous suitors\\". In 2015 the app moved away from Facebook, and currently only allows registration via mobile phone numbers, for both male and female users. Lulu describes itself as \\"a private network for girls to express and share their opinions openly and honestly\\" about the weaknesses and strengths of the manners, appearances, spending habits, and career ambitions of their male acquaintances. The company's expansion of its user base focuses heavily on recruiting undergraduate members of American all-female sororities, which commentators describe as reflected in the \\"app's linguistic and visual design [which] is visibly influenced by US sorority culture.\\" The app has been highly controversial, and the functionalities offered by the app are frequently described negatively in the popular press as \\"sexist and objectifying\\", \\"nonconsensual\\", and \\"shallow and mean\\". Although female users cannot write their own comments to avoid bullying, the company's harshest critics hold that the pre-selected terms used within the app for evaluations in the form of hashtags are instrumental in \\"reinforcing completely horrible stereotypes\\", accuse the site of tolerating a sexist double standard, and liken the \\"candor\\" for which the app aims to a form of public harassment. The company's founder, Alexandra Chong, refers to the app's functionalities as \\"provocative\\" and \\"ground-breaking\\" and the website holds that the multiple-choice nature of evaluations creates \\"a safe and positive place for girls and guys\\". The company has also been accused of inappropriate use of Facebook accounts' user data. Lulu does not query male Facebook users for their consent in integrating their profiles in the app, and at the time of its release the product caused notable social \\"recoil\\" and received significant negative coverage in the press for its violation of Facebook's policies on the use of user data. The company notes that its data collection policies are now in compliance with Facebook's Platform Policies. Also, it points out how users who have unwittingly been incorporated into Lulu's databases may contact their support center for the removal of their personal data. Lulu was sold to Badoo in 2016.  History  Lulu was created by Alexandra Chong, a Chinese-Jamaican/Canadian from Ocho Rios and former Jamaican tennis Olympian who studied at Appalachian State University and received her LLB from the London School of Economics. She has stated as her inspiration a \\"really funny\\" Valentine's Day date she went on in 2009, after which she wanted to be able to discuss details with her female friends without sharing information on Facebook. In December 2011, after stints at Upstream and The Corporate Executive Board Company, she launched Luluvise.com, which was succeeded in January 2013 by Lulu, then as a private, invitation-only app for female users at Florida State University and the University of Florida. In February 2013 the app was released nationally in the US. By April 2013 the app had 200,000 men listed and rated.After Rebooting, Lulu Sees Its Database Of Guys App Hit 200K Users In 8 Weeks Across U.S. Campuses. TechCrunch (2013-04-09). Retrieved on 2013-07-30. In November 2013, the app was covered by The New York Times, at which point the company claimed more than a million users. New York magazine reported in November 2013 that the average rating for male users on the app's 10-point numerical scale was 7.5 points.  Current features  Female users answer multiple-choice questions about a man’s sense of humor, manners, ambition, commitment level, and look and style. Results are converted to a 0-to-10 rating, which constitutes a guy’s “score”. Unlike other review-based systems, they cannot add their own comments. Male users on Lulu can add photos and hashtags to influence female users' opinion. They can edit any detail on their profiles, see their average score, how they perform across 7 categories, and which hashtags girls they know use to describe them. They can also acquire a subscription to see a more detailed breakdown of their scores. Lulu has an online automatic self-removal tool that allows both male and female users to delete their account at their request and \\"blacklist\\" their mobile phone numbers. Their Support Center also mentions the inclusion of agree and disagree buttons let girls weigh in on the accuracy of each review. In 2014 Truth Bombs was launched: an anonymous forum where users can anonymously share their doubts and opinions about relationships and sex. In 2015 the Private Chat feature was added to the app as a main feature, allowing women “to make the first move”: female users can invite men they are interested in to a one- on-one conversation via their profiles or Truth Bombs.  Acquisition by Badoo  In February 2016, Badoo acquired Lulu and removed the app's ability to rate men.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infamous-dating-app-lulu-for-rating-men- sells-to-badoo-201528005.html  Controversy  The stock phrases and \\"coy euphemisms\\" used within the app in the form of hashtags to evaluate users' male acquaintances have been noted by The Independent to evoke \\"stupid cookie- cutter men who can't feel or think and can be summarised in a few sassy phrases of cute girl-talk\\", highlighting concerns that the app violates the bounds of social propriety and could be used to debase the social standing of users of whom it contains evaluations. Lulu states that it aims to \\"unleash the value of girl talk\\" to empower its female reviewers. Columnists dispute the app's stated aim to help \\"girls to make smarter decisions on topics [such as] relationships\\", arguing that the \\"Lisa Frank girly fun\\" of the app and its pre-selected review terms prevent the service from meaningfully addressing a substantive topic such as dating abuse or sexual assault. The Telegraph praised the app for “...making dating safer for women”. Critical reactions such as in Forbes note the a sexist double standard regarding the app: \\"If Lulu existed for men to rate women,\\" columnist Kelly Clay notes, \\"it's likely that Apple would probably reject it from the app store.\\" The Daily Barometer likewise suggested that the app is degrading to both men and women, concurring that: \\"If there was a man’s version of Lulu, women would absolutely not stand for it.\\" Slate described the app as \\"creepy\\" and noted that \\"[u]nwelcomed sexual commentary isn't a compliment, it's harassment.\\" Forbes notes that Lulu \\"has enabled female millennials to think that digital revenge is acceptable ... and provided them a sleek platform to slander men.\\" In May 2013, a \\"Shut Down Lulu\\" petition was created on Change.org by a man named George Orlin. This petition gained over 700 supporters. Lulu attracted attention after its release for how its initial collection of male Facebook users' data was at the time in violation of Facebook's Platform Policies. The public nature of the app's negative evaluations has also sparked concerns that the evaluations could potentially be libelous in nature. According to the libel laws of the United Kingdom, observers note that it \\"could well be construed by a judge in a court of law that [an evaluation on the app] has 'lowered [the male Facebook user] in the minds of right thinking members of society'\\". In response to such allegations, a Lulu representative responded at the time that they \\"have good legal counsel and guidelines in place\\" and \\"also have a takedown policy\\", and the site notes that its present data collection does not violate Facebook's Platform Policies. Lulu's terms and conditions likewise have referenced how \\"uploading or posting information about other individuals might encroach on the data protection rights of those individuals\\".

Perrigo was a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and in his works presented himself as an \\"Expert in machine Shop and Factory Organization, Modern Shop Methods, Time and Cost Systems, etc.\\"Perrigo (1906, title page) Perigo wrote the successful Modern machine shop: construction, equipment and management in 1906 and Modern American Lathe Practice in 1907.

Allen (2010). A Guide to the Study of Occupations. p. 179. This work was divided into three parts, as Perrigo explained: :The plan of the work is to divide its subject-matter into three parts or sections : :* Part First being devoted to the Construction of the Modern Machine Shop or Manufacturing Plant, describing and illustrating buildings of approved form and arrangement: :* Part Second to its Equipment with modem Tools, Machines, and Appliances, and the division of the plant into the proper departments for administrative and mechanical purposes; and ;* Part Third discussing the all- important question of Management^ showing the fallacy of some of the so-called systems of Management, Time and Cost Systems, and minutely describing and illustrating a plain, concise, accurate, and common-sense System of Management, and of Time and Cost Keeping, that may be easily and economically administered and yet give all the important information necessary for operating the business to financial success. :The work is fully illustrated by over two hundred engravings made from designs and drawings prepared by the author especially for this purpose...\\"' One of those engravings was one of the first modern organizational charts (see image below), in which Perrigo pictured the new \\"System of Organization and Management of the Modern American Shop or Manufacturing Plant.\\"Perrigo (1906, p. 237) In his days this image was as \\"the shop tree.\\"  Machine shop construction  The first part of Modern machine shop, Perrigo (1906) focussed on the physical construction of the building, and presented a model machine shop. Of this idealized situation Perrigo gave descriptions on the front elevation of the factory building model (A), a plan of the works in the machine shop (B), the construction of the factory building (C), and the arrangement of tools and departments (D). With this model machine shop Perrigo explored the way the space in factories could be organized.Anna Vemer Andrzejewski (2008). Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America. p. 77 This was not uncommon in his days. Many industrial engineers, like Alexander Hamilton Church, J. Slater Lewis, Hugo Diemer, F.A. Scheffer etc., published plans for some new industrial complex. Details could be quite specific, such as for example the location of the foreman's office. In this matter Perrigo in his 1905 article \\"Economical Arrangement of Machinery,\\" only stipulated, that it should be prominently located. In line with this work, in 1911 Charles Day presented new method, in which the routing diagram was proposed as basis for designing the laying out of industrial plants. This took machine shop construction to another level.Charles Day, \\"The Routing Diagram as a Basis for laying Out Industrial Plants.\\" Engineering Magazine, September, 1910. p. 809-821; Republished in: Industrial Plants, 1911. Chapter VII.  Machine shop management  In the third part of Modern machine shop, Perrigo (1906) noted, that early 20th century the days of the \\"one-man management\\" had died, and instead had come the management by \\"a system of divided and property distributed responsibility.\\" In this system \\"the real head of the establishment takes up only the consideration of the larger, broader, and more comprehensive questions of importance in management, leaving to his able assistants the questions of the next grade of importance, and in their special spheres, while they, in turn, divide the next grade of lesser responsibilities with their assistants, the foremen, and so on down through the several grades of less importance to the operatives or workmen.\\"Perrigo (1906, p. 235) And he continued: :Thus we have what has come to be known as \\"the shop tree,\\" representing graphically this plan for the division of responsibility in the management of the entire plant. There are three grand factors that go to make up the sum of this problem of manufacturing which should not be lost sight of at the outset. Graphic Chart, showing the System of Organization and Management of the Modern American Shop or Manufacturing Plant, 1906 :# Capitalization of the scheme : The factor comprises the stockholders, represented by the Board of Directors, whose head is the president of the company, and whose executive officer is the general manager. This group includes the administrative and financial departments of the entire establishment. :# Manufacture of the product : The factor comprises the manufacturing plant, whose head is the works manager or superintendent, and includes the purchase of stock and supplies, the care of the grounds and buildings, and the entire process of manufacturing and shipping the product. :# Marketing or selling of the product : The factor includes the advertising or publicity department, and the sales department, each with its own manager, and frequently presided over by the vice-president. :While each of these departments are of prime importance in all respects, it is the second that particularly concerns us in this work. Nevertheless it may be interesting and instructive to present, see figure, a graphic diagram representing the division of duties and responsibilities as generally arranged for establishments such as we are considering, and as representing the management of our model manufacturing plant. Perrigo concludes that \\"this will show the regular channel for all official orders and communications, as well as, inversely, the channel through which all reports go through intermediate officers to their proper and ultimate destination. It also shows the proper relation of one department with another, of certain groups of departments with other groups, and in a general way the entire plan of organization and management. A careful study of these important relations is recommended to the earnest student of machine shop and factory organization, management, and economics.\\"  Modern American Lathe Practice, 1907  In the Modern American Lathe Practice, 1907 Perrigo aimed to present:Perrigo (1907, p. 3) * a history and development of the lathe from early times to the present day; * a briefly discussion of its effects upon manufacturing interests and its practical use on various classes of work; and * a comparison (representative, theoretical, and practical) of the American lathes as built in the US in his days. Perrigo explained about the earliest form of a lathe proper, that it was, \\"a machine for shaping wood into forms having a curved, and generally a circular transverse section, by the action of a chisel or other cutting tool upon the piece, which is rotated for the purpose,\\" as shown in the figure (A). Before the Industrial Revolution the foot lathe has been use for many years for turning both wood and metals (see image B). Perrigo mentioned he built such a lathe himself, when he was between fifteen and sixteen years of age.Perrigo (1907, p. 28) An 18th century new development for lathes was the idea of screw-cutting. On 18th century innovation in lathe was the use of a \\"master screw\\" in the thread-cutting machine, which seems to have been of French origin. Perrigo explained that \\"in this lathe there was an arbor upon which threads of different pitches had been cut. These threads were on short sections of the arbor and by its use the different pitches required could be cut. While the exact manner of using this arbor was not described, its probable method of use will readily suggest itself to the mechanic, and was, no doubt, used at an earlier period, and in fact was what led up to the use of a lead screw or arbor with a multiplicity of different pitches. The principle is analogous to that used in the \\"Fox\\" brass finishing lathe so well known and extensively used, not only in finishing plain surfaces but in \\" chasing threads. This machine is shown\\" in the third image. Perrigo (1907, p. 39) Later in the book Perrigo focussed on contemporary problems of for example the introduction of high-speed steel. One of the many anecdotes mentioned, was about the problem of the fast-moving ribbon of metal, that with high-speed steel got thrown of the lathe. Perrigo recalled: \\"At a speed of, say, two hundred feet per minute, the chip comes writhing and twisting, almost red hot, in a continuous length, shooting here and there, everywhere but the chip box; and quick must be the workman that manages to keep well out of the way of it, for it 'sticketh like a brother' when once he gets tangled in it...\\"Perrigo (1907, p. 231); Partly cited in: Thomas J.

History The structure, which was completed in 1873, was most likely designed by Victorian civil engineer John Hawkshaw after he took control of Holyhead harbour works in 1857. The lighthouse was the last major building completed on the breakwater. The three- storey black and white tower, unlike many contemporary lighthouses, is square. It measures on each side, is high and rests above the high-water mark. It has chamfered angles and a stepped plinth set on an oval platform on the breakwater. A square design was chosen because it made the living quarters more comfortable. Much of the original living accommodation inside remains intact. The tower's external features include a roll-moulded string-course projecting above the first floor level. There is also a moulded cornice which supports a walkway around a circular glass-housed light. The tower is surmounted by a weathervane and finial. The enclosed fresnel lens creates a light with a range of . This lighthouse is considered architecturally important because it forms part of the ambitious Victorian engineering works to create \\"harbours of refuge\\" throughout Great Britain. In the 19th century, packet ships approaching Holyhead in the fog would be warned by a bell operated from the lighthouse. In the late 1870s, this was supplemented with rockets which would complement the gun fired from the fog warning station on North Stack, Anglesey. The lighthouse was manned until November 1961, when it was automated. Among the last keepers in the 1950s were Arthur Burgess and David John Williams. The latter later became a speaker for Trinity House giving talks on the service. Like most other lights in Gwynedd, it is now operated from Trinity House's Holyhead Control Centre. Today the upkeep of the lighthouse is the responsibility of Holyhead port authority, which is operated by Stena Line.

Even with appropriate treatment, it may pose risks not only to the mother, but also to the fetus. Thyroid hormones, T4 and TSH, diffuse across the placenta traveling from the mother to fetus for 10–12 weeks before the fetus’s own thyroid gland can begin synthesizing its own thyroid hormones. The mother continues to supply some T4 to the fetus even after he/she is able to synthesize his/her own. Infants with sporadic congenital hypothyroidism show T4 concentrations in the umbilical cord suggesting the mother is still providing 25-50 percent of T4. If these infants are not screened soon after birth for their hypothyroidism and treated, the infants can become permanently intellectually disabled, since they can’t meet their bodies demand for T4. One study showed infants born to treated hypothyroid mothers had abnormal thyroid function compared to matched controls. Therefore, it is advised to monitor T4 levels throughout the pregnancy in case treatment dosages should be increased to accommodate both the mother’s and fetus’s thyroid hormone requirements. If the supply of T4 is insufficient the mother may be at risk for preeclampsia and preterm delivery. The infants may also be at risk for suppressed psychomotor development and slightly lower IQ. In a study of induced hypothyroidism in pregnant rats they were able to find lower levels of growth hormone in both the blood and pituitary gland of the offspring. This study also looked at neural development in rats and found that maternal hypothyroidism in rat mothers is related to deterioration, damage, disorganization and malformation of neurons and dendrites in the pups, which may result from an impaired antioxidant defense system and high levels of oxidative stress.

The site dates back to the 6th century, although the building that stands today dates largely from the late 13th and 14th centuries. The palace is under the management of Cadw, the historic environment service of the Welsh Government. It is open as a visitor attraction and an open-air theatre, and being part of the city's cathedral precinct, there are more than 300,000 visitors a year. It is a Grade I listed site.  Early history  St Davids became home of the Marcher Lords, responsible for guarding the border between England and Wales, so would have been a site of great strategic importance. It was also considered a hugely important religious site, housing relics of the St David, patron saint of Wales. William the Conqueror is said to have visited as a pilgrim in 1081.: The original monastery that stood on the site was established in the 6th century and, over the succeeding four centuries, was ransacked at least 10 times by Norse raiders. The arrival of the Normans in the 11th century brought some stability. They appointed a Norman bishop and attempted to protect the site by building a motte and bailey fort and, later, a stone defensive wall.  Establishment of the palace  The Bishops Palace has been described as the work of a series of 'builder bishops', with work carried out in the late 13th and 14th centuries. In 1284, King Edward I visited St Davids on a pilgrimage and this visit may have inspired some earlier work because Bishop Thomas Bek, who served from 1280–93, was among his former statesmen. Bishop Bek was responsible for construction of the chapel in the south-west corner, the hall, the private apartments and the gate. The man responsible for much of the site that can be seen today was Bishop Henry de Gower (1328–47). He carried out major works in the cathedral itself, built the Great Hall with wheel window in the east gable, the distinctive arcaded parapet and the porch. Gower's main legacy is the two great ranges. The east range – the simpler of the two – was the first to be built. The much grander south range was built for entertaining. The beginning of the Reformation also heralded the decline of the Bishops Palace. In 1536 Bishop William Barlow stripped the lead from the roof. Legend has it that he used the money to pay for the dowries of his five daughters. However, as he had no daughters at that time, and the first marriage of a daughter did not occur until about 25 years later, the story was probably fabricated by his many enemies. He made so much money from this that a sixteenth-century account said that more than twelve years revenue of the bishopric would have been needed to cover the cost of replacing it, and the building fell into disrepair. Bishops stayed less at St Davids and, by the middle of the 16th century, the chief episcopal residence had been relocated to Abergwili, Carmarthenshire. In 1616, Bishop Richard Milbourne applied for a licence to demolish some of the buildings. By 1678, when another licence for demolition was sought, the palace was considered beyond repair.  Site significance  Professor Emeritus of history at Swansea University Ralph A. Griffiths OBE has described St David's Cathedral and Bishops Palace as: \\"one of the most significant sites in the history of Christianity in the British Isles, and one of the earliest\\", and \\"where Welsh Christianity and nationalism are entwined\\". Much of the town wall remains, particularly on the south side. The main gate into the cathedral compound, Porth-y-Tŵr, dates from about 1300 and remains intact. Inside the palace, most of the structure remains in spite of being open to the elements.  Conservation work  The condition of Bishops Palace began causing serious concern from the 1990s. Construction materials had included a mixture of local stone and Precambrian volcanic rock. Exposure to the elements was affecting key features of the highly decorated stonework, windows and sculptures, causing erosion. In some places, walls were becoming so thin there was a danger of structural collapse. Under the guidance of CADW, a restoration programme began in 2003 and was completed in October 2009. The work involved the rebuilding of some walls and repair of damaged carvings. Conservation also provided an opportunity to improve accessibility, with floors replaced to make it possible to circuit the building's ground floor. The project was subsequently shortlisted for a Grand Prix Europa Nostra, an award from the Pan-European Federation of Cultural Heritage.  Bishops Palace in art  The Bishops Palace captured the imagination of the British painter Turner, and features in his South Wales Sketchbook of 1795, now part of the Turner Bequest at the Tate. There are two images, one of which was drawn inside the ruins. The second, in graphite and watercolour, shows the entrance to the Great Hall.
