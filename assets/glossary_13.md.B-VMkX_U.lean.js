Some of the original Zuruahã traded with the rubber tappers but the tribe contracted influenza, resulting in a high death rate, from 1922 to 1924. The survivors withdrew away from non- native settlements. They enjoyed relative isolation from non-natives until the 1970s when missionaries and latex extractors entered their traditional territory.

Pressures on their territories results in increased suicide by the Zuruahã. Sustained contact began in 1980. They are hunter-gatherers. In 1984, the Zuruahã Project was created to mitigate the adverse effects of outside contact on the Zuruahã people.

His untimely death in London at the age of 49, from influenza, ended an outstanding career. At a time when surgery was limited by the twin fears of shock and infection, Maunsell was among the first to use the antiseptic technique newly introduced by Joseph Lister, and to operate for internal disorders of the pelvis, abdomen, skull and brain. Among his original contributions was a technique for excising bowel tumours and joining the cut ends to restore continuity. He also originated a flap method of amputating the tongue and a new technique for cleft palate operation in which he used woodcarver’s tools when reconstructing the bony defect in the hard palate. He also undertook a world-first operation on the hind brain (cerebellum) to relieve pressure from a life-threatening expanding cyst. Background and early career Henry Maunsell and his future wife Mary Fosbery were from long-established Anglo-Irish Protestant families originally based near Limerick. Maunsell was born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College Dublin. In 1867 he was second in his graduating class, and then passed the surgical MRCS in London. With his parents and 2 sisters he emigrated to Melbourne, Australia and was appointed Resident Surgeon at the then-named Melbourne Hospital. Senior Surgeon William Gilbee gave the first report in Australia or NZ on Lister’s new method of antiseptic surgery, writing “...I am indebted to Dr Maunsell, my Resident Surgeon, who carefully carried out all the instructions laid down by Mr Lister” The move to New Zealand The discovery of gold near the New Zealand town of Hokitika in 1865 resulted in major growth of the town and port. Maunsell was appointed Surgeon Superintendent of the Spit Hospital at £500 pa., and in October 1869 replaced Dr J. Rutherford Ryley, who coincidentally had reported the first use of carbolic antiseptic in New Zealand. He married Mary Augusta Fosbery on April 27, 1871 and the Maunsells' first child, Ada Mary, was born in 1872, followed by Alice Mary Fosbery (1874), Francis, Miriel Clarence, Kathleen Fosbery (1878) and Lylie Widenham (1880). Maunsell entered private practice but still had access to the hospital. Surgery was limited, often for injured limbs (lacerations, fractures, dislocations) or excision of diseased joints (e.g., from tuberculosis). The pelvis, abdomen and chest were never opened. In October 1873 Maunsell sustained serious chest injuries when his horse fell. He struck his chest against a tree stump driving two ribs into his lung. He survived but was off work for 10 weeks and was described as being ‘left with a weakness of the lung’. In May 1876 Maunsell sold his practice and took his family to Dublin so he could undertake an MD degree. Queen Bee In 1877, Maunsell (now an MD) and family sailed from London to Nelson on the Queen Bee (a 3 masted barque-726 tons). The 30 passengers included 2 sisters of Mary Maunsell & widow Mrs Gibbs and her 8 children. After 108 days the ship struck Farewell Spit. Three open boats were launched (with no provisions), the first landing to seek help. Boats 2 and 3 drifted for 2 days, landing on D’Urville Island (during which a crew member drowned). Boat 3 (containing the Maunsell/Fosbery group) was later found by Maoris who helped by the Naval Brigade, returned to a jubilant Nelson. Alice Maunsell (3yrs) died 3 months later from the effects of exposure. On reaching Dunedin, Maunsell purchased a house and gained a coveted position on the Hospital Staff, later also becoming City Health Officer (Dec. 1881). He was soon recognised as a bold and innovative surgeon. In 1887 The NZ Medical Association & NZ Medical Journal started & Maunsell could now publish. In response to complaints from Maunsell & Dr Ferdinand Batchelor, a purpose - built operating theatre was built in which both could safely open the pelvis and abdomen (and in the case of Maunsell, a world first operation, opening the back of the brain). Maunsell represented the New Zealand Medical Association at the first Congress (Adelaide 1887) & presented 7 papers. An important paper at the 2nd Congress (1889) was “A New Method of Intestinal Resection”. Two months later he was appointed “Lecturer on Surgery”. Return to London Early in 1891 the University granted Maunsell leave partly on health grounds but also to study schools of surgery in Europe and America. They settled in South Kensington. The Maunsells joined the Royal Colonial Institute (RCI) and, it was reported they “…gave hospitality to all comers from NZ”. At the British Medical Association Meeting in 1891, the combative, anti-Listerism surgeon, Lawson Tait, gave a paper. Maunsell was unfazed when discussing Tait’s paper and then presented his own. In 1892 Maunsell resigned from the University and began a promising career in London. Two papers (Lancet Feb. & August 1892), described his unique method of bowel anastomosis by invagination, an idea said to have originated by watching his wife’s (or his tailor’s) method of attaching a sleeve, turning it inside out. The second paper described resection of tumour in the lower colon/upper rectum, retaining the sphincters & continence. Maunsell did not forget the University, donating anatomical models and welcoming students in London. In 1893 Queen Victoria opened the Imperial Institute and the Maunsells attended the Royal Gala. A world pandemic of influenza reached London in early 1895. Maunsell, with previous lung problems, died after a week’s illness aged 49. The funeral was on Feb. 25 and his remains cremated (an uncommon practice at the time), at Woking on Feb. 26. Tributes in his obituaries included those in the British Medical Journal from the eminent Sir Frederick Treves, later surgeon to King Edward VII.

She was loved for her selfless work for the poor, walking many miles each day in every kind of weather to treat those who could afford no medical help.  Early life  Maude was born in Christchurch New Zealand, on 11 August 1862. She was the eldest of eight children born to Thomas Maude and Emily Brown. At the time of her birth, Thomas was a member of the provincial government, the Canterbury Provincial Council. In 1876, the family went to England and Maude attended Linden School in Blackheath, London for three years until their return to Christchurch in 1879. As a child, she visited the poor and sick, and decided then that becoming a nurse would be the best way to help others.  Career  In 1889 Maude went to England to train as a nurse. She became a fee-paying \\"lady probationer\\" at Middlesex Hospital, England, where she spent four years. She returned to Christchurch in 1893 and took up the position of matron of Christchurch Hospital. During her time she oversaw the opening of a new nurses' home and the introduction of nursing training programmes. However Maude was frequently involved in debates with the hospital board and in 1895 a commission of inquiry was set up into her management of the hospital. She was cleared of all charges, but the experience left Maude convinced that she was not suited to institutional management. In November 1896 Maude began her district nursing work. She based her work on the English model of providing nursing services to the sick poor in their own homes, but was also inspired by the sisters of the recently established Deaconess Institution, who combined nursing services with in-home parish visits. She worked from premises in Durham Street, dispensing medicines and treating those who were able to travel to see her. In her first year, she also made over 1,100 home visits, all on foot, often carrying pans for her patients to use for cooking or washing. Funding was provided by local philanthropist Lady Heaton Rhodes. In March 1901, the Nurse Maude District Nursing Association was formed, and a committee of volunteers took over the task of organising financial support. Some local parishes contributed funds, and street appeals were held to raise money for substantial projects such as a new building. As funding allowed, more nurses were employed, and services were extended. Local business people provided the service with horses and buggies and bicycles for the nurses' rounds, and Nurse Maude was given a car. Nurse Maude's services went beyond physical nursing. Nurses provided clothing and food as needed, and visits began with prayers. She also believed in the importance of education, and in 1917 began a series of lectures on home nursing and childcare in collaboration with the local branch of the Mothers' Union. In addition, she responded to epidemics as needed – with two camps for tuberculosis patients in 1904 and 1905, and by organising services for influenza victims in the 1918 flu pandemic. In 1908, she extended her services to the recently deceased, agreeing to prepare bodies at the public morgue for burial. In 1919, a two-storey building was built on Madras Street for the association by Sir Heaton and Lady Rhodes. Nurse Maude moved into the upstairs flat and lived there til her death, and the association used the building until 1973. Shortly before she died Maude accepted a small recognition of her life's work and was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1934 New Year Honours \\"for services in connection with district nursing\\". At her request, the award was presented in a private ceremony.  Death  On her death, Maude's body lay in state at ChristChurch Cathedral, where her memorial service was held. City streets were lined with hundreds of mourners as her funeral procession passed by on its way to St. Peter's Church in Upper Riccarton. She was buried in the churchyard there, in her nurse's uniform.  Legacy  The nursing organisation she established is still in operation. It is staffed by 1,500 people, paid and unpaid, and provides district nursing, in-home care and palliative hospice care in the Canterbury, Kaikoura and West Coast regions of New Zealand's South Island. There are two stained glass windows which commemorate Maude's life and work – one in the former chapel of Christchurch Hospital (now the Christchurch Nurses' Memorial Chapel), and one in the chapel of the Community of the Sacred Name (formerly the Deaconess Institution). A marble bust of Maude stands in the foyer of the Nurse Maude Hospital.

Rapp were architects who made their name by designing movie houses across the United States. The first film to show there was Excess Baggage, starring William Haines. Over 14,000 people jammed the building during its opening; they did not come to watch the film, but to see the theatre's opulent chandeliers, marble columns, and detailed moldings on the walls. It was the site of a number of notable movie premieres, including the first 3-D feature film, Bwana Devil. Between 1950 and 1972 the theatre operated under the name Loew's Theatre and showed live concerts, rather than movies. Between 1972 and 1975 the building was known as the Palace Concert Theater, and was used primarily for rock concerts. In 1973-1974 alone, the Palace Concert Theatre hosted Bee Gees, The Kinks, The Doors, Lou Reed, Jackson Browne, Van Morrison, Fleetwood Mac, and Aerosmith. The band King Crimson recorded the song \\"Providence\\" during a 1974 concert at the venue, and the recording was featured on their seventh album Red, released later that year. The theater was almost torn down in the late 1970s. According to mayor Buddy Cianci's account, the theatre's owner asked for a permit to demolish the building. Cianci pledged over $1 million of city funds to keep the theatre open. The theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as Loew's State Theatre. From 1978 to 1982, the theatre operated under the name Ocean State Theatre. Beginning in 1999, the theater was extensively remodeled and largely restored to its original 1928 opulence. It was also expanded to be able to accommodate traveling Broadway productions and orchestra performances. In 1996, PPAC became the anchor of Cianci's Arts and Entertainment District, which offered tax breaks to attract artists to downtown.

It originally aired on April 29, 2010. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and directed by Liz Friedlander. Plot Stefan (Paul Wesley) is still locked up in the basement and he is hallucinating because of the lack of blood. He flashes back to 1864, the night Katherine (Nina Dobrev) was taken. He and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) try to save her, Stefan distracting the guards of the prison truck and Damon getting her out. The moment they try to untie her, Damon is shot from afar and dies. Stefan is also shot and dies a moment later. He wakes up in a quarry and Emily (Bianca Lawson) is there who explains to him what happened. He and Damon are both in transition and she made them the rings to protect them from the sunlight at Katherine's request. Stefan says he never drank Katherine's blood but Emily tells him she was compelling him to do it, while Damon was doing it willingly. In the present day, Damon brings Stefan some animal blood to drink but Stefan denies it saying he is not hungry. Damon throws the bottle in the cell and leaves when Alaric (Matt Davis) calls him to inform him what he has found about John (David Anders). He tracked some calls to Grove Hill and the two of them plan to go and check it out. John tries to talk with Elena and tells her that he knows she knows. When he asks her what her mother would think of all these, Elena makes him understand that she knows her birth mother is Isobel who is a vampire herself and she leaves. Anna (Malese Jow) is now a student at Mystic Falls High and she is happy to see Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) while Pearl (Kelly Hu) meets John at the Grill. She tells him that she will not give him the Gilbert gadget he wants and John tries to use her \\"weakness\\" for Gilbert men due to her past with Jonathan Gilbert to get it. He makes fun of her by telling her that Jonathan felt so guilty for betraying her because he loved her and then laughing he tells her that Jonathan hated her. Pearl is upset and before she leaves, she tells him that she gave the device to Damon. In 1864, Damon and Stefan discuss about their new state with Damon saying that he doesn't want to complete the transition and prefers to starve to death since Katherine is gone and there is no purpose to continue living. Stefan decides not to turn as well and heads to his home because he wants to say goodbye to his father Giuseppe (James Remar) before he dies. Giuseppe freaks out when he sees Stefan and tells him that he was the one who shot and killed his sons. Believing that Stefan is now a vampire, he attacks him and Stefan - not knowing his own strength - hurtles his father away in defense. Giuseppe gets hurt and starts bleeding and Stefan does not have the strength to resist to his need for blood and he feeds on his father completing his transformation. Back in the present day, Elena visits Stefan in his cell ignoring Damon's warnings not to go down there alone. She tries to make him drink the blood but Stefan still refuses it. She opens the cell door and goes in. Stefan tries to scare her away but Elena does not go anywhere. He finally takes the blood and drinks while he is telling Elena the whole story of how he completed his transformation. Elena is shocked at the story but not turned off and she wants him to keep talking to her. She leaves to give him some space but puts his ring next to him telling him she will be upstairs to wait for him to continue their conversation. In the meantime, Alaric and Damon arrive at the house John's phone calls were tracked to and they run into a vampire named Henry (Evan Gamble). Henry attacks Alaric but Damon throws him off recognizing him from the tomb. Henry tells them that John helped him get used to the modern world and in return, Henry keeps tabs on the other vampires from the tomb. Henry's phone rings and Damon offers to answer it since it is John but when he does not, Henry suspects that something is not right and he tries to attack Alaric again who stakes him in the heart and kills him. Alaric and Damon talk about not finding anything about Isobel and Alaric decides that he should stop looking for answers and let it go. Anna comes back home and finds Pearl packing and telling her they are leaving town because too many people in Mystic Falls know the truth and they are not safe. Anna does not want to leave and Pearl lets her make her own decision for once and if she wants to stay she is free to do it. Anna leaves to pay Jeremy a last visit before they go. Damon comes back home to find Elena waiting for Stefan come upstairs. She tells Damon that Stefan is depressed and it might have helped if he had not spent all those years making Stefan feel guilty over Katherine. Damon gets mad with that and he fills her in on the rest of the story, after Stefan fed on their father and came back to where Damon was. In 1864, Damon still tries to resist human blood when Stefan arrives with a young girl as a gift for him to feed on. Stefan admits that he fed on their father and he keeps telling Damon how better he feels now and insists that Damon needs to complete the transformation. Damon does not want to do it but Stefan bites the girl's neck making it bleed. He pushes Damon closer to her blood and Damon cannot resist so he finally drinks from her. Elena, after hearing the whole story, realizes the reason Stefan wants to die and runs downstairs to find him but he is gone and he left his ring behind. Stefan goes to the place where the quarry was once, where he brought Damon that girl to feed on. He remembers newly turned Damon promises him that he would make his eternity an eternity of misery. Then Emily appears to tell him that she only helped him because she owed Katherine and that his heart is pure and that will be his curse because that will make him feel guilty for every person he hurts. Stefan's memories bring him back to present where Elena finds him. She knew where he would be after Damon told her the whole story. Elena tries to talk to him and make him see that he is not responsible of everything that happened since they cannot control everything. She tries to tell him that he is a good person and Stefan tells her that it hurts to try be good because every time he fights his need for human blood it hurts. He is afraid that if he continues living he doesn't know if he'll be able to fight this forever. Elena gives him his ring and tells him he has a choice; throw it away and die or put it on and keep fighting. She turns to leave when Stefan calls her out, he puts his ring on and they kiss. Pearl and Harper (Sterling Sulieman) finished packing and they are ready to leave town. Pearl opens the door but she drops dead after someone stakes her in the heart. Anna, returns home after to find both, Pearl and Harper, dead. Outside, John throws his stake gun into his car and calls Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) to update her about the vampires. Elena and Stefan return to the Salvatore house. Elena goes upstairs leaving the two brothers alone. Stefan thanks Damon for helping him through his withdrawal and Damon tells him that there is no need for him to carry his own guilt as well. Before Damon leaves, he admits that the reason he was always being mad at Stefan was not because he betrayed Katherine and the others took her to kill her or because he made him complete his transformation, but because Katherine was supposed to turn only him but she turned both of them. The episode ends with Alaric having a drink at the bar when a familiar voice greets him. Alaric does not look surprised to hear it, turns around and sees Isobel (Mia Kirshner) standing in front of him.

It is an evolution of the Cyrano IV installed on the Mirage F-1 and in turn was developed into the RDI (Radar Doppler à Impulsions), a specialist air-to-air radar for French Mirage 2000 interceptors, and the multimode RDY (Radar Doppler Multitarget), which could track more targets at a time and added further air-to-ground modes. History The first prototype of the RDM flew in January 1980 and production deliveries began in early 1983. Thomson funded development of the RDM from the Cyrano IV at a cost of FFr350m (~US$50m); the RDI air intercept derivative was funded by the French government. The RDM was intended for export Mirage 2000's and the first 50 for the French Air Force; the remaining 150 French Mirage 2000C's would have the RDI. In the end only 37 aircraft were fitted with the RDM, the first production RDI was delivered in December 1986. The two radars are interchangeable in the aircraft but have little in common electronically; the biggest difference is that the RDI increases the look-down/shoot-down range in pulse doppler mode from to , and supports the improved Super 530D missile. Allegedly the French Air Force would have preferred to wait until the RDI was ready and have an all-RDI fleet, but the government insisted that they take aircraft with RDM so that it could be marketed abroad as the front-line radar of France. Design RDM operates in the X-band with a coherent travelling-wave-tube transmitter and an inverted- Cassegrain antenna in diameter. The RDM operates in air defence/air superiority, strike and air-to-sea modes. In the air-to-air role, the system can look up or down, range while searching, track-while-scan, provide continuous tracking, generate aiming signals for air combat and compute attack and firing envelopes. For the strike role it provides real-beam ground- mapping, navigation updating, contour-mapping, terrain-avoidance, blind let- down, air-to-ground ranging and Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI). In the maritime role it provides long-range search, track-while-scan and continuous tracking and can designate targets for active missiles. For air-to-air combat, the RDM provides a 120° cone of coverage, the antenna scanning at either 50 or 100°/s, with ±60, ±30 or ±15° scan. For air-to-air gun attacks, the 3.5° beam can be locked to the target at up to range, with automatic tracking within the head-up display field of view, or in a 'super-search' area, or in a vertical search mode. Options include a Continuous Wave Illuminator (CWI) and Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS). Comprehensive Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM) are incorporated. The manufacturers claim that RDM will detect 90% of 5m² RCS fighter-sized targets out to in clear air using a four-bar search pattern over 120° in azimuth, and with a single-bar pattern over 30° in azimuth, dropping to in pulse-Doppler look-down mode. RDI uses a higher pulse-repetition frequency for its dedicated interception role, increasing clear-air range to around and is possible in look-down mode.

Most SBHCs provide a combination of primary care, mental health care, substance abuse counseling, case management, dental health, nutrition education, health education and health promotion. An emphasis is placed on prevention and early intervention. School-based health centers generally operate as a partnership between the school district and a community health organization, such as a community health center, hospital, or the local health department. Most SBHCs report that the majority of their student population is eligible for the National School Lunch program, a common indicator of low socioeconomic status. History In 1894, New York City officials initiated the first school health program in the U.S. Its purpose was to assess and, if needed, exclude children with contagious diseases from the classroom. In 1902, the program expanded and employed the nation’s first school nurse. As school health programs spread across the country, health screening and communicable disease control were their principal focus. President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty in the mid-1960s is credited with bringing into focus the significance of health issues among impoverished school-age children. The enactment of Medicaid in 1965 was indicative of a perception in the public policy community that there was a need to develop programs in service of better health care for low-income individuals, including children. In 1967, Philip J. Porter, head of pediatrics at Cambridge City Hospital in Massachusetts and director of Maternal and Child Health for the city's health department, began to address this issue. He assigned a nurse practitioner to work on site in an elementary school to deliver primary medical care to enrollees. Four additional health clinics were opened in Cambridge schools in the years that followed. The first school-based health centers opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1967), Dallas, Texas (1970), and St. Paul, Minnesota (1973). The first two were launched because their founders believed that school-based health care could provide accessible, affordable health care to poor children. In 1970, the West Dallas Youth Center at Pinkston High School was opened as an outreach center for a federally funded Children and Youth Program based in the University of Texas Health Sciences Center Pediatrics Department. Pinkston High School was the nation’s first high school to offer comprehensive care provided by nurse practitioners, physicians, social workers, nutritionists, and health educators. School-Based Health Center Growth in the U.S. from 1984 to 2008 In 1978, funding through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation spurred an increase in the number of centers throughout the United States. These early centers demonstrated they were effective in increasing young people’s access to care. The role of the pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) as an advanced practice nurse with skills to provide primary health care to children began to emerge. With a seed grant of $7,000, the first school nurse practitioner certification program was established at the University of Colorado in the late 1960s in response to public dissatisfaction with the limited role of the school nurse and the recognized need for on-site school health. School Nurses in SBHC’s School nurses are an essential part of SBHC’s because they help prevent and reduce student absences in the educational institutions they are attending. The primary purpose of a school nurse is to ensure that students are healthy while maintaining good attendance. School nurses in SBHC’s display seven different characteristics that allow them to help students excel academically. A school nurse provides direct care to students, leadership for the facility of health services, screening and referral for health conditions, promotes health, and serves as a connection between parents, students, health care professionals and the larger community. The health services offered by the schools is determined by the different school districts. School nurses should provide certain services that meet the minimum requirement according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The minimum requirements include # care for students with special health care needs # plan for managing emergencies # health screening programs # verification of immunizations # infectious disease reports # a system to identify students chronic health care needs that can impact their educational achievement Current Status In the past 40 years, school-based health centers have grown from a handful to 1,909 in 45 states.U. S. Government Accountability Office. (2010). School-based health centers: Available information on federal funding. (Publication No. GAO-11-18R). The initial survey in 1985, conducted by the Center for Population Options (now known as Advocates for Youth), reported 35 centers nationwide. Follow-up surveys by The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools (previously known as the Making the Grade National Program Office ) continued to document SBHC growth through the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the late 1990s, the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care (NASBHC) has conducted a nationwide census of individual centers tri-annually, every 3 years. Demographics and Characteristics SBHCs serve all school-levels: in elementary schools (20%), middle/junior high schools (15%), high schools (30%) and a mix of elementary, middle, and high schools (21%). They are located in urban (59%), rural (27%), and suburban (14%) communities in all regions of the country. The centers often tailor their services and outreach specifically to the school's student population. Seventy percent of the student body in schools with SBHCs are minorities. They include Hispanic/Latino (36.8%), Black (non-Hispanic/Latino) (26.2%), Asian/Pacific Islander (4.4%), Native American/Alaskan Native (1.7%) and “other” (1.4%) youth. Facilities are staffed by one or more different types of health care providers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, substance abuse counselors, and mental health professionals. Controversy Despite the growing number of school-based health care during the past three decades, the issue of providing reproductive health care at school-based health centers continues to spark controversy. Data has demonstrated how these controversies about reproductive health may frame more general concerns about school-based care. In response to these issues, in recent years SBHCs have begun requiring parents to sign written consents for their children to receive the full array of services the centers provide. Most facilities have an advisory board consisting of community representatives, parents, youth, and family organizations to provide planning and oversight. Funding Historically, federal funding for school-based health centers came primarily from the maternal and child health block grant and the Healthy Schools/Healthy Communities program. However, as SBHCs have begun to focus on third-party reimbursement, Medicaid has also become an important source of support. The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, a grant program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, assisted states over the past two decades in developing the long-term financing policies required to sustain school-based health centers. About 20 percent of SBHCs receive funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Health Center Program, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Other funding is derived from various sources such as community- based health centers, healthcare systems, foundation grants, and state and local funds. In July 2011, $95 million was awarded to 278 school-based health center programs nationwide, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act(PPACA). This was the first award in a series of allocations to the School-Based Health Center Capital Program. PPACA's allocations for this program will ultimately total $200 million in funding for SBHCs over four years. The awards will enable recipients to expand their offerings and to increase their collective capacity by over 50 percent. Outcomes Researchers have examined the impact of SBHCs across a number of health and education domains. Access to care: Children with the greatest unmet need, including uninsured students, benefit most from SBHC services. SBHCs appear to have a significant ability to reduce health care access disparities among African Americans and disabled students. The Bienestar Health Program has strong evidence that supports its ability to increase positive health behaviors and reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes among Mexican-American and other at-risk youth. In Chicago, the Rush University College of Nursing operates health centers inside three public schools, providing convenient, comprehensive reproductive and sexual health services to students who are primarily African-American. Though recent research findings indicate that students with health and behavioral health needs are utilizing services, racial disparities exist; Asian students have been found to be less likely to access services than their Black and Latino peers. Clinical services: School- based health centers facilitate immunization services for adolescents with greater efficiency than community health centers. Children living with asthma benefit greatly from school-based health center services, as evidenced by fewer emergency room visits and reduced activity restriction. Children with asthma served also have improved attendance in school. Research has also shown SBHCs to be effective in working with adolescents who demonstrate depressive symptoms, use substances, and engage in sexual activity. Educational Impact: SBHCs aid in reducing school absences and promoting healthy behaviors. In Connecticut, 96.7 percent of students using school-based centers return to class the same day. In a study of youth in the San Francisco Unified School District, results suggest students' use of SBHCs is associated with positive academic outcomes, particularly through the students’ self-reported perceptions of school assets and having a caring relationship with an adult SBHC employee. Cost-savings: SBHCs result in cost-savings for Medicaid due to reduced emergency room use and hospitalizations.

The majority of cocoa farms are now located in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Background Cocoa beans are a high demand consumer item all over the world. They are used in products such as chocolate, candy bars, drinks and cocoa powder. However, cocoa farming and the production of cocoa beans are extremely fragile and labour-intensive processes. The cocoa trees are also called Cacao trees. The process begins with a Cacao plant, or Theobroma cacao, in which the beans are extracted from pods that grow directly on the cocoa trees branches. Each pod contains roughly 30 to 50 beans.The European Chocolate and Cocoa Industry. (n.d.). Cocoa Farming: an Overview. http://www.cocoafarming.org.uk/Cocoa_farming_bw_v8_uk.pdf After the beans are extracted they must go through a time-consuming process of natural fermenting and drying. The farming process of cocoa can damage the environment depending on the practices of the farmer, as well as be limited by the environment itself. Global Climate Change, for example, causes longer drought seasons making it more difficult for farmers to plant and sustain new Cacao trees.Anim-Kwapong, G. J., Frimpong, E. B. (2004) Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment Under the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme Phase 2 (NCCSAP2): Vulnerability of agriculture to climate change- impact of climate change on cocoa production. Ghana, Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana. Most of the environmental impact comes from .  Process of farming  Cacao beans drying in Cunday, Colombia Cocoa farming can only occur 15 degrees north or south of the Equator. It can take approximately three years after planting for the trees to be fruitful enough to harvest the pods. Cocoa pods are pollinated by tiny flies called midges. Ripe cocoa pods, which are yellow in colour, are then cut down from the trees using a machete. Use of a machete in this fashion, termed machete technology, prevents disease from spreading among cocoa pods, and thereby decreases the need for pesticides. The pods can be very low on branches and easily accessible or higher up on thick branches. Once they are gathered, they are sliced open and the cocoa beans are extracted from the pods. The beans are then spread out, usually between banana leaves, for a number of days to ferment. Next, the seeds are placed in the sun to dry for several more days. After drying, they are gathered, placed into bags and taken to collection offices. From there, they are shipped around the world to be processed into end products.Padwick, N. (2010). Fair Farming. Farmers Weekly, 152(9), 88-89.  Environmental impacts  = Full sun cocoa = In Ghana, Cocoa contributes 64% of all exports.Gyimah-Brempong, K., Konadu Apraku, K. (1987). Structural Change in Supply Response of Ghanaian Cocoa Production: 1933-1983. The Journal of Developing Areas, 22(1), 59-70. Traditional cocoa farms are planted in the shade among other crops and trees. They are especially found in the tropical rainforest areas.Bisseleua, D.H.B., Missoup, A.D., Vidal, S. (2009). Biodiversity Conservation, Ecosystem Functioning, and Economic Incentives under Cocoa Agroforestry Intensification. Conservation Biology, 23(5), 1176-1184. Farming cocoa beans is a long process and many factors can affect the farm's yield. Farms' cocoa crop outputs struggle to match the increasing demand for chocolate. It is estimated that the demand for chocolate will increase twofold by the year 2050. Farmers have shifted towards unsustainable, less environmentally conscious practices to meet these demands.Slomkowski, K. (2005). Chocolate’s Dark Side. E: The Environmental Magazine, 16(6), 33-342. Some farmers have shifted their crops out of the shade and into direct sunlight.Piasentin, F., Klare-Repnik, L. (2004). Gro-Cocoa: Global Research on Cocoa. http://www.cabi.org/Uploads/File/Gro%20Cocoa%20pdfs/gro-cocoa5.pdf This practice yields a greater quantity in a short period and at lower quality. Cacao trees with no shade tend to accumulate more weedsBentley, J.W., Boa, E., Stonehouse, J. (2004). Neighbor Trees: Shade, Intercropping and Cacao in Ecuador. Human Ecology, 32(2), 241-270. as well as be more susceptible to diseases such as Witches Broom and Frosty Pod Rot. If the crops begin to accumulate pests, farmers use large amounts of herbicides to rid the crops of these pests. The herbicides used damage the land and the health of the sprayers applying the herbicide. Excessive spraying of pesticides can also cause the weeds and insects to build up a resistance which will eventually create more harm to the crops.Rice, R.A., Greenburg, R. (2000). Cacao Cultivation and the Conservation of Biological Diversity. Ambio, 29(3), 167-173. = Deforestation = Cocoa farming also contributes to rainforest and old growth forest deforestation.England, P. (1993). Forest Protection and the Rights of Cocoa Farmers in Western Ghana. Journal of African Law, 37(2), 164-176. By clearing land in these forests, farmers decrease the biodiversity and interactions between the many different organisms that naturally live in the area. Many wildlife habitats are destroyed and the plant species diversity is drastically reduced. Nutrients begin to leach out of the soil due to poor irrigation and inadequate soil protection, which can increase the erosion of the soil. The more intense the farming practices are, the more damaging they are to the ecosystem.Asase, A., Ofori-Frimpong, K., Ekpe, P.K. (2009). Impact of Cocoa Farming on Vegetation in an Agricultural Landscape in Ghana. African Journal of Ecology, 48(2), 338-346. Cocoa farming becomes a destructive circle as farmers wear out the soils and cut further into the forest to obtain fresh land. All of these processes stress the Cacao trees and result in lower yields, giving the opposite effect to what the farmers expect from these practices. Some of the forests in Ghana and other Cocoa producing countries have been declared protected by the government after observing the Tropical Rainforest destruction. However, with a shortage of fresh land to plant Cacao trees, some farmers are beginning to illegally cut down parts of these protected forests. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of these protected forests have been cut down. On September 13, 2017 NGO Mighty Earth released a report\\"Chocolate's Dark Secret\\".

Cargill, Olam International and Barry Callebaut were notified of the findings of Mighty Earth’s investigation and did not deny that the company sourced its cocoa from protected areas in the Ivory Coast.  Proposed solutions  Through groups and programs such mee the World Cocoa Foundation, Rainforest Alliance, Roundtable for a Sustainable Cocoa Economy, and activities of regional NGOs like Conservation Alliance, IITA and Solidaridad cocoa farming can return to its sustainable roots through education programs and help in finding ecologically and economically sound resources to further their farming. As a last resort, some programs will help farmers to access pest control products such as biocides as an alternative to the harmful pesticides being used. Other programs promote proper irrigation, composting, suitable soil management, and intercropping, meaning planting other trees and fruit crops in the surrounding land of the Cacao trees.World Cocoa Foundation. (n.d.) Sustainability Principles and Goals. http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/sustainability-principles-and-goals/ Some farmers will burn old, fermented pods and place them back on the soil as a form of composting and fertilizer.Styles, R. (21 January 2011). Green Business: Divine. http://www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/green_business/736265/green_business_divine.html To stop the process of deforestation, it is suggested that farmers replant on their current land while using the practices previously mentioned. = Shade- grown Cacao = Cacao pods evolved to grow in the shade of a highly biodiverse rainforest canopy. It has been suggested that Cocoa farmers go back to the original and natural ways of farming, by planting within the natural tree- cover and without cutting down existing trees. When an area has already been clearcut another possibility exists. Planting trees, especially fruit filled trees around and within the plantation, helps with growth of Cacao plants. These trees can provide shade to the Cacao plants and be a source of oxygen replenishment to the environment. Additionally, planting cacao under taller trees protects the more fragile cacao from direct sunlight, which greatly increases the length of its productivity and makes the cacao tree less vulnerable to disease. Another benefit of such companion planting is the increase in potential habitats for birds and insects. If the shade trees are fruit-bearing, this can also provide additional income to the farmer. However, simplifying such shade-cover may threaten biodiversity. Therefore, maintaining the complexity of shade structures is paramount in combatting losses of biodiversity. Shade trees return organic matter to the soil through falling leaf litter and decaying branches. The shade provided by these trees also helps to keep soil moist in dry seasons which results in less damaging irrigation practices. Shade trees will raise the amount of infiltration and slow erosion of the soil. Since shade inhibits the growth of weeds, farmers are able to use less or perhaps no pesticides which can decrease the occurrences of Witches Broom in these crops. Cacao plants that grow in the shade provide the environment with more biodiversity, allowing natural populations and habitats to flourish. Finally, shade can be extremely helpful in keeping and lengthening the productivity of old growth Cacao plants.

It is native to the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains of the United States, from Virginia around Florida to Texas and inland to Oklahoma and Arkansas. Quercus incana is a tree growing to about 10 meters (33 feet) in height, with a maximum height around 15 meters. The \\"national champion bluejack\\" was a specimen from Texas that was 15.5 meters (51 feet) tall and 2.1 meters (7 feet) in circumference, and had a crown spread of 17 meters (56 feet). The trunk is short and the crooked branches form an open, irregular crown. The platy bark is dark brown or black. The leaves are generally oval and up to 10 centimeters long by 3.5 wide. They are glossy green on top and woolly-haired underneath. The acorn is up to 1.7 centimeters long by 1.6 wide, not counting the cap. The oak reproduces by seed and by resprouting from the rootcrown when the upper parts are removed. It can form thickets by spreading underground runners. Quercus incana often grows in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems, where it shares the understory with turkey oak (Quercus laevis) and wiregrass (Aristida stricta). In the Big Thicket of Texas it codominates with post oak (Quercus stellata) and a number of pines. The oak can be found on sandy soils. It grows downslope from ridgetops, where the soils are finer and less dry than the tops of the ridges. It is well adapted to wildfire and grows in habitat where fire is common and often required, such as longleaf pine ecosystems. The oak does not tolerate dense shade and requires fire to remove taller, more robust oaks that would otherwise outcompete it. The wood of Quercus incana is hard and strong, but the trees are usually too small to be good for any uses except fuel or posts. The acorns provide food for many animal species including the Sherman's fox squirrel, which lives in longleaf pine communities.

Event At approximately 3:30 AM on December 6, 1970, 25 cars from an eastbound 114 car freight train operated by the Lehigh Valley Railroad derailed in the town, rupturing and spilling approximately 2,000 pounds of cyanide crystals, and 30,000 to 35,000 gallons of the solvent trichloroethylene. Cleanup attempts The cyanide crystals were removed, but the trichloroethylene had soaked into the ground and contaminated at least two nearby wells, producing a noticeable smell and solvent properties. The Lehigh Valley Railroad attempted to eliminate the smell in the spill area by pumping approximately 1 million gallons of water from a nearby flooded quarry and saturating the cleanup zone with it, then allowing the water to seep into the ground. This resulted in the trichloroethylene further saturating groundwater in the area, with many more wells becoming contaminated, with approximately 50 wells testing positive for TCE by 1990 to 1994. The Lehigh Valley Railroad began supplying affected homes with drinking water beginning in 1971, and later provided filter systems for contaminated wells. Today The site of the Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment is currently considered an EPA Superfund site, and is monitored by both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The former Lehigh Valley Railroad line where the derailment took place was abandoned. 2011 LeRoy school investigation Beginning in August 2011, 14 students (13 girls and 1 boy) from the LeRoy Junior-Senior High School began reporting myriad perplexing medical symptoms including verbal outbursts, tics, seizure activity, and speech difficulty. In mid-January, 5 days after a community meeting in which the New York State Department of Health stated that their diagnosis could not be revealed publicly due to privacy concerns, two of the girls appeared on NBC's Today Show to discuss their frustration with not getting adequate answers. The next day, Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, a neurologist treating most of the girls, was given permission to share the diagnosis of conversion disorder and mass psychogenic illness. Unsatisfied with the results of the investigation, the girls and their parents spoke out publicly against their diagnosis, stating that they believed the situation warranted further scrutiny from outside sources. Alternative medical theories for condition were suggested, including Tourette syndrome and PANDAS, which Dr. Mechtler and his team ruled out as possibilities. Erin Brockovich, noted environmental activist, was called to town to investigate environmental pollution from the 1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment as a possible cause. During this time, many of the girls appeared in the local and national media, as well as posting on social media. As this happened, many of these girls started reporting worse symptoms to their doctors and the illness spread to 20 individuals in total. Eventually, as doctors encouraged their patients to stay away from the media and the media attention died down, many of the girls' symptoms improved. By the end of the school year in June, one girl was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome, likely the source of the mass psychogenic illness, and most of the girls who received treatment for conversion disorder were back to normal in time for graduation. No environmental causes were found after repeat testing around the school and surrounding areas of town.Le Roy, New York#2011 illness outbreak References * Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment Category:Le Roy, New York Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment Category:Railway accidents and incidents in New York (state) Category:Derailments in the United States Category:Superfund sites in New York (state) Derailment 1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment ","title":"1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment"},{"id":"34575733","text":"Isidore Mankofsky (born September 22, 1931, in New York City, New York) is an American cinematographer.

The image on the left uses regular white light endoscopy. The image on the right stains with Lugol's iodine, and identifies a squamous cell carcinoma, which does not pick up the stain. Chromoendoscopy is a medical procedure wherein dyes (often the same stains used in histology) are instilled into the gastrointestinal tract at the time of visualization with fibre-optic endoscopy. The purposes of chromoendoscopy is chiefly enhance the characterization of tissues, although dyes may be used for other functional purposes. The detail achieved with chromoendoscopy can often allow for identification of the tissue type or pathology based upon the pattern uncovered. Varieties of stains Stains used in chromoendoscopy have three major mechanisms. Absorptive stains have an affinity for particular mucosal elements, and include Lugol's iodine, methylene blue, toluidine blue and crystal violet (gentian violet) . Lugol's iodine specifically stains non-keratinized squamous epithelium, and consequently is useful for identifying squamous tissue, squamous dysplasia and squamous cell carcinomas. Methylene blue stains absorptive epithelium and is useful for identifying abnormality in the small intestine and colon. Barrett's esophagus involves change in the mucosa of the esophagus into a tissue that includes glands (intestinal metaplasia), and as a result, can be identified with methylene blue staining. Also, methylene blue has been used to identify dysplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis. Toluidine blue stains nuclei of malignant cells blue, and is used in oral and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Crystal violet is absorbed into intestinal and neoplastic cells and is used to identify Barrett's esophagus and colonic neoplasms. Contrast stains are not absorbed but rather provide contrast by permeating between irregularities in the mucosa to highlight irregularities. The primary contrast stain is indigo carmine, administered at varying concentrations between 0.1% and 0.8%. The chief utility of indigo carmine is in the identification of dysplastic cells in individuals with chronic ulcerative colitis. Reactive stains undergo an observable change due to a chemical process related to the function of the gastrointestinal tract. Congo red is used as a test for achlorhydria in the stomach, to test adequacy of vagotomy ( post adequate vagotomy, gastric acid secretion is abolished) and to detect presence of ectopic gastric tissue, as it changes colour from red to black at a pH less than 3. Should acid not be present in the stomach, it would remain red. Typical uses and safety The most common applications for chromoendoscopy are the following: identification of squamous cell carcinomas or dysplasia of the esophagus, identification of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia, identification of early gastric cancer, characterization of colonic polyps and colorectal cancer, and in screening for dysplasia in individuals with ulcerative colitis. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum when compared to plain colonoscopy. The dyes used for chromoendoscopy are typically considered to be safe. Some dyes such as indigo carmine may discolour the feces temporarily. Lugol's iodine when applied to the esophagus can lead to discomfort, inflammation (of the esophagus or stomach) or rarely allergy. Sodium thiosulfate has been used to avert this. Techniques for application and visualization The stains are typically applied to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract using a device known as a spray catheter that is inserted into the endoscope. Before staining, the mucosa may need to be treated with an agent to remove excess mucus to enhance staining. N-acetylcysteine and acetic acid are typically used for this purpose. One or two minutes after staining with the dye, the mucosa typically is washed with water to remove excess amounts of the dye, which can obscure visualization. Depending on the reason for which chromoendoscopy is being performed, the dye can be sprayed directly on a suspected abnormality (such as for identification of squamous cell carcinoma) or diffusely to the mucosa (such as for screening for dysplasia in ulcerative colitis When the stain is applied diffusely in the colon, a complete colonoscopy is performed with the instrument lying in the cecum. The mucosa is washed and the dye is applied to tissue while the endoscope is retracted by 20 to 30 centimetres. That area of mucosa is characterized, and then the procedure is repeated in the next area of the colon that is more distal, until the procedure is completed. Stains can be used in conjunction with other techniques that allow for better identification of mucosa, such as magnification endoscopy. Various classification of \\"pit patterns\\" in the mucosa have been used to attempt to correlate to tissue type. The most commonly used rubric is the Kudo classification. Alternatives Various other techniques have been used to delineate the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract without the use of dyes. Narrow-band imaging is a technique where ambient light of a blue and green wavelengths are used to highlight detail, particularly of vascular structures. It has the advantage requiring only a change in light source, and is less cumbersome than instillation of dye. A similar technique to narrow-band imaging using blue and green filters has been used in endoscopes manufactured by Fujinon, termed Fuji Intelligent Chromoendoscopy (FICE), and has been referred to as virtual chromoendoscopy. Other techniques that can enhance detail of mucosa include confocal microscopy, magnification endoscopy and optical coherence tomography.

He led the party through the 1962 provincial election in which the party increased its seat total in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 3 to 7, more than doubling them, and its share of the popular vote from 25% to 36%. The result was not enough to prevent the Liberal government of Joey Smallwood from returning to power with a substantial majority government. The son of Joseph Michael Greene and Marie Eugenie Williams, he was born in St. John's and was educated at Saint Bonaventure's College, at the University of Notre Dame and at Merton College, Oxford. Greene was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1953 and practised law in London for several months, returning to Newfoundland in September of that year. He was called to the Newfoundland bar in October 1953. He was a 31-year-old lawyer when he was first elected to the legislature in the riding of what was then called St. John's East during the 1959 provincial election by defeating incumbent James D. Higgins, leader of the United Newfoundland Party which had broken away from the Tories prior to the election. Prior to being elected, Greene was counsel to the International Woodworkers of America's Newfoundland local. The election also saw the defeat of Conservative leader Malcolm Mercer Hollett after Smallwood personally unseated him run in his St. John's West riding. Subsequent to the election, Greene replaced Hollett as party leader and leader of the opposition. In the 1962 provincial election, Greene succeeded in being personally re-elected and in increasing his party's number of seats to 7 based and increasing his party's share of the vote from 25% to 36% and in wiping out the breakaway United Newfoundland Party whose sole remaining MHA was defeated by a Tory candidate. However, the Tory gains were not enough to stop the Liberals from being re-elected with a commanding majority. Greene stepped down as party leader on January 14, 1966 and Noel Murphy was chosen acting leader.St. John's Evening Telegram, January 15, 1966 Greene did not run for the legislature in the 1966 provincial election and returned to his law practice. In 1967, during the federal Progressive Conservative leadership election, he supported the candidacy of E. Davie Fulton. He served as chair of the board of regents for Memorial University, as a director for Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation and as president of the Kiwanis Club of St. John's. On November 4, 2014, he died in St. John's at the age of 86. Greene's father Joseph served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1928 to 1932. His great uncle, Daniel Joseph Greene, was Premier of Newfoundland from 1894 to 1895.

After some health concerns, Martin turned his attentions to photography. In 1879, he traveled to London and was introduced to rapid 'instantaneous' photography at the Royal College of Chemistry. Once he returned to New Zealand, he opened a studio in Auckland. Martin became well known for his topographical and ethnological photographs. He often presented these at the Auckland Photographic Club. In 1886, Martin was able to capture the eruption of Mt Tarawera on camera. These photographs were published in the Auckland Evening Star. Martin has also been published in the Auckland Weekly News, New Zealand Illustrated and exhibited photographs at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford.

For example, if paint is applied in a wet film at a 100 μm thickness, and the volume solid of paint is 50%, then the dry film thickness will be 50 μm as 50% of the wet paint has evaporated. Suppose the volume solid is 100%, and the wet film thickness is also 100 μm. Then after complete drying of the paint, the DFT will be 100 μm because no solvent will be evaporated. This is an important concept when using paint industrially to calculate the cost of painting. It can be said that it is the real volume of paint. Here is the formula by which one can calculate the volume solid of paint, :(Total sum by volume of each solid ingredient in paint x 100%)/ Total sum by volume of each ingredient in paint. A simple method that anyone can do to determine volume solids empirically is to apply paint to a steel surface with an application knife and measure the wet film thickness. Then cure the paint and measure the dry film thickness. The percentage of dry to wet is representative of the percentage of volume solids. In earlier days, the volume solid was measured by a disc method but now a sophisticated instrument is also available which takes only a drop of paint to check the volume solid. Understanding 'volume solids' allows you to know the true cost of different coatings and to know how much paint is being used to perform its function. Generally, more expensive paints have a higher volume of solids and therefore provide better coverage.

He was born in London, England, and arrived in New Zealand three years after the Wellington area was first settled. In Wellington he was involved with theatrical production at the Ship Hotel, Olympic Theatre, Britannia Saloon and Royal Lyceum. He made himself useful in the early days of the settlement by engraving tombstones, engraving illustrations for newspapers, and grinding lenses for telescopes. He ran a bookshop and sold sheet music, and contributed to the organised social and civic life of Wellington. In New Zealand he was the first regular producer of plays, a playwright (his play Marcilina premiered in 1848), and the first optics professional in that country to make a telescope. He was the father of Alice Marriott and the great-grandfather of Marriott Edgar and Edgar Wallace. Background Marriott's parents were Leeds optician William Marriott and Alice McGuinness. His wife was Sarah Bateman (died Wellington, 1885), whom he married on 19 May 1822 in Hackney, London. The second of their three daughters was actress Alice Marriott, born on 17 December 1824 in London, and they had two sons also. He was the great-grandfather of Marriott Edgar and Edgar Wallace. In July 1842, Marriott left his family and sailed through gales and wrecks with a drunken captain on the 497-ton barque Thomas Sparks. He disembarked at Port Nicholson, New Zealand, nearly seven months later on 31 January 1843, when Wellington was still a new town of three years. Ten years after that, his wife and two of their children joined him. On 25 August 1886, he died in Wellington after a few days' illness. Career in London In London, Marriott had \\"learned from his father the skills of optician and mathematical instrument maker\\", and possibly also his engraving skills, but initially became a reporter for The Times newspaper. At the same time he was producing Shakespeare plays, and was involved in acting, painting and music. Career in New Zealand =Theatrical production= 1845 playbill for Britannia Saloon Having arrived in New Zealand in January 1843, it took him only four months to organise his first series of theatrical productions which opened at the Ship Hotel, Wellington, on 11 May 1843. There had been no previous attempt at regular performances of plays in New Zealand. Encouraged and assisted by Marriott, the publican erected the temporary Royal Victoria Theatre behind the Ship, and it opened on 12 September 1843. Marriott managed that theatre, which was closed after two months. He was co-designer of the Olympic Theatre in Wellington. He decorated it, and was responsible for the scenery and the whale oil gas for lighting purposes. With his associate Rowland Davis he opened the Britannia Saloon theatre in Willis Street, Wellington, in September 1845, as well as the Aurora Tavern which later became the Royal Lyceum Theatre. Rather than management, Marriott's involvement was mainly concerned with directing, producing, scene-painting, and general performance, i.e. music, dancing, singing and acting. =Writing= On 11 July 1848 at the Britannia Saloon, Marriott's company premiered his play, Marcilina. According to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, this is believed to have been the first performance of a play written by a New Zealander. During the prelude to the re-election of Isaac Featherston as Wellington Superintendent, Marriott wrote in Featherston's support The Constitutional Budget of 1858, made up of poems and political songs. =Optical instruments and engraving= At Bolton Street Cemetery there are examples of his engraved tombstones. He also engraved illustrations of events in the town, because engravings could at that time be reproduced in newspapers and magazines. For example, he engraved illustrations of public dinners and of the laying of the cornerstone of Wellington's Provincial Hall. It was his brother William Marriott II who inherited their father's business, but James had nevertheless learned the skills. Working as an optician would have provided him with regular income, but he was also an instrument maker. He was the first person to make telescopes in New Zealand, having made at least one marine telescope by 1844, possibly in response to the Great Comet C/1844 Y1 of December 1844 and January 1845. He did not make many of them. He did, however, give a lecture on the subject at the Wellington Athenaeum and Mechanics' Institute in August 1852. Between 1849 and 1875 he advertised his spectacles, telescopes, sextants, compasses and engraving in The Wellington Independent. file:Reform Banquet Wellington 1849.JPGMarriott's engraving of the Royal Lyceum Theatre, 1849 File:Oddfellows Hall Lambton Quay (2).pngMarriott, fifth from left in stove pipe hat, holding his lapels, stands before the neo- classical (but wooden) Oddfellows Hall, 1860s =Business, civic and social contribution= Marriott reckoned that he \\"did a bit of everything, from chiselling tombstones to putting in ladies' teeth.\\" On Lambton Quay, Marriott had a bookshop and stationery business, which also sold music, between around 1853 and 1885. He worked for the Tradesmen's Club and the Mechanics' Institute. In 1843, along with his associate Rowland Davis, he was one of the founders of Wellington's Oddfellows Order.

He was born in Rangiaowhia, Waikato, New Zealand, on 3 October 1888. He is credited with nine hydroelectric installations and numerous inventions. He served on electric power boards, regional councils and as a deputy mayor. Mandeno was born at Rangiaowhia, near Te Awamutu in the Waikato region to a farming family. He studied at St John's Collegiate School in Auckland and started at Auckland University College in 1905. The following year he transferred to Canterbury College from where he graduated in 1912 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. He married Constance Mary Woodward at Mangere in 1913. Mandeno invented, developed and successfully promoted widespread use of \\"single wire earth-return\\" (SWER) grids for rural electrification in New Zealand.Mandeno, L. (1947), \\"Rural Power Supply Especially in Back Country Areas\\" . Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute of Engineers, Vol. 33, p. 234. This form of grid uses only a single wire, and made rural electrification dramatically more affordable and commonplace. It improves the standard of living of rural families. SWER is now used in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Brazil and some parts of the United States. In New Zealand, SWER is sometimes called \\"Mandeno's clothesline.\\" Mandeno was Chief Electrical Engineer at Frankton Power Station from 1913 to 1916. He promoted all-electric buildings, and invented, then improved an early electric storage water heater. He was a very early user of prefabricated steel poles. He invented molds to cast concrete poles on site. At Kaikohe he used New Zealand's first pole-erecting machine. On Urupukapuka Island in the Bay of Islands, he installed a submarine cable to Zane Grey’s fishing camp. He arranged the North Island's first electric milking shed and sawmill. Chateau Tongariro and its ski-lifts were powered by his systems. He developed high- pressure hot-water systems for Auckland and Tauranga hospitals. Mandeno served on the Tauranga Electric Power Board. In 1926, Mandeno was accused of a conflict of interest by Tauranga's Mayor, Bradshaw Dive. Mandeno entered private practice at this time. Near this time, his health also declined from a digestive complaint, and he lost about 20 kg on a liquid diet which he maintained for several years. From 1931 to 1956, Mandeno was on the One Tree Hill Borough Council. He was deputy mayor from 1944 to 1956. His can-do attitude was cited. At Lake Taupo in 1962, he installed the Kuratau hydro station. The rocky gorge was discovered to be unstable after the lake had already begun to fill. On a very tight schedule, he designed a new rock-filled dam. When contractors refused to tender, he raced the waters, supervising construction himself. By the end of his career he had designed and constructed nine hydroelectric power stations. A history of WEL Networks describes his distinguished career designing and building hydro power stations.Wiring up the Waikato published by WEL Networks research by Chris Gilson In the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours, Mandeno was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to engineering.

The ship, built in Japan in 1983, operated on short runs in that country, before being brought to Papua New Guinea in 1998 and plying a regular weekly route between Kimbe, the capital of West New Britain, and Lae, the capital of the mainland province of Morobe. In the early hours of 2 February 2012, the ferry capsized and later sank in rough conditions. The final death toll is unknown because the exact number of passengers is unknown; estimates range from 88 to 223, with the official Commission of Inquiry estimating the dead at 146 to 165. Capsize and sinking =Incident= Early in the morning of 2 February 2012, the ship capsized due to rough conditions in the Solomon Sea. The ship was hit by three large waves. About four hours later, at approximately 6:00 am local time (8:00 pm on 1 February UTC), she sank 9 nautical miles (16 km) from Finschhafen. She was near the end of her 20-hour journey from Kimbe to Lae. 12 crew and an estimated 350 passengers were aboard at the time, though it is possible there may have been more than 500 passengers on the ferry. =Rescue and recovery= A joint rescue effort by Papua New Guinea and Australia was formed shortly after the sinking. Many survivors were rescued by six merchant vessels alerted by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which was alerted by Rabaul Shipping that the ferry had disappeared from a satellite tracking system. Seven fixed wing aircraft, including a P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force, three helicopters and seven boats were involved in locating survivors. Heavy seas and high winds complicated the search and rescue operations. 246 survivors were rescued by nightfall on 2 February. As of 5 February 2012, the bodies of six victims had been recovered, and no further survivors were rescued. Over 100 remained missing. It was reported that 27 survivors were on an uninhabited island; one survivor contacted a family member with a cell phone, although Papua New Guinea's Maritime Safety Authority claimed on 5 February that any survivors would already have been located. On 10 February 2012, Radio New Zealand reported that the number of people rescued had been re-calculated as 237, and that the number of people missing (based on new information from relatives of those onboard) was 321. This would indicate that some 558 people were aboard the vessel, although it was only permitted to carry 310. Seven of the survivors, three of whom had serious injuries, were admitted to Angau Memorial Hospital in Lae. Some of the survivors experienced stomach pains because they swallowed seawater containing oil leaking from the boat. Attempts were made to determine the names of all victims, including \\"a public appeal for family and friends to come forward.\\" However, an exact list was deemed impossible because of incomplete manifests, poor record-keeping, lack of identification upon boarding, and the local tradition of using multiple names. Investigation A Commission of Inquiry was set up on 10 February 2012. Under the leadership of Judge Warwick Andrew, the Commission was charged with determining the cause of the disaster, reasons for the high loss of life, any crimes or civil wrongs, and recommendations for preventing another occurrence. The Commission spent several months hearing evidence from survivors, rescuers, weather experts, and other witnesses. The Commission submitted its final report to caretaker Prime Minister Peter O'Neill on 28 June 2012. O'Neill said that the 200-page report would first need to be tabled in parliament before its release and would thus have to wait for the new parliament to sit following the 2012 general election. =Final report= Rabaul Queen had passed her annual survey and \\"been deemed to be seaworthy for normal operations\\". However, the crew were found to be uncertified and unqualified, including the ship's navigational and engineering officers, and inadequate background checks had been performed before hiring. The captain's understanding of ship stability was \\"incorrect\\" and not sufficient for command of a ship. In addition, the crew did not wear uniforms, which impeded the passengers' ability to appeal for help in an emergency. Rabaul Queen was also found to be overloaded. According to its certification, the ship was fit to carry 310 persons with a maximum of 295 passengers. However, the managing director of Rabaul Shipping, Peter Sharp, had directed his captains to carry 350 passengers and the ship \\"routinely\\" took aboard passengers in excess of 295. The Commission set the number of people on board at the time of the accident at between 392 and 411, of whom 369 to 384 were ticketed passengers, about 11 were unticketed infants, and 16 were crew. With 246 people surviving, the Commission determined that 4 dead were recovered plus between 142 and 161 people were \\"considered to be missing and presumed dead\\", for a total death of 146 to 165. The actual number is unknown, because a shipping manifest was not completed. The Report criticized Rabaul Shipping's policies and Papua New Guinea's oversight of maritime operation. Despite recommendations from the International Maritime Organization regarding safety of life at sea, PNG regulations did not require a safety management plan. Rabaul Shipping had no emergency response plan, and their thin Floating Staff Handbook contained \\"nothing that provides guidance to the crews of Rabaul Shipping ships in relation to passenger welfare on board the ships\\" and was \\"deficient in almost every aspect\\". Information that was in the Handbook, such as life jacket drills demonstrations after leaving every port, were ignored by crew according to testifying survivors. Survivors also testified that \\"life jackets were padlocked in a wire cage\\" or were stored in locked cabinets. The \\"appalling and inhumane conditions\\" of the passengers aboard was blamed on Captain Sharp. The Papua New Guinea National Maritime Safety Authority showed \\"very poor corporate governance\\", \\"a high level of incompetence\\", and a history of \\"ineffectiveness\\". In all, the Commission's report provided 34 proposals that would \\"promote maritime safety\\", including new safety regulations, better staffing and equipment for a coordinated rescue center, and improved weather reliability and reporting for shipping. Legal action Four people were charged in connection with the sinking: the managing director of Rabaul Shipping, Peter Sharp; the captain of the vessel, Anthony Tsiau; chief mate Michael Zirau; and the former manager of the port, Grace Amen. They faced 172 counts of manslaughter and 1 criminal charge of \\"sending an unseaworthy vessel out to sea\\". Charges against a fifth person, National Maritime Safety Authority manager Joseph Titus Kabiu, were dropped because of insufficient evidence. The trial began in April 2016. The case against Zirau was dropped. Sharp's solicitors presented a manifest to show that only 88 people could have died, and the number of manslaughter charges were reduced to 88. Sharp and Tsiau were acquitted of the manslaughter charges, after the court ruled that the State had failed to prove there was any risk associated with the normal use of the ship. Amen will be tried separately for manslaughter. , the status of criminal charges for \\"sending an unseaworthy vessel out to sea\\" are unclear. The trial had been set for March 2018, but news outlets reported in October 2018 that the public prosecutor had dropped charges against the three (owner Sharp, captain Tsiau, and port manager Amen). Shortly thereafter, however, the country's Attorney General allegedly \\"promised to use his powers to re-open investigations\\" into the disaster, stating that \\"I assure you that the matter is under scrutiny.\\" References Category:1983 ships Category:Ferries Category:2012 in Papua New Guinea Category:Maritime incidents in Papua New Guinea Category:Maritime incidents in 2012 Category:West New Britain Province Category:Morobe Province Category:February 2012 events in Oceania ","title":"MV Rabaul Queen"},{"id":"34576238","text":"The Job Mills Block is located in Lodi, Wisconsin, United States.

He was the son of Captain Patrick Mowat of the post ship HMS Dolphin. He was born in Scotland and went to sea at the age of 18. Career After six years as an able seaman and midshipman Mowat was commissioned a Lieutenant aboard HMS Baltimore in 1758. In 1764, Lieutenant Mowat was given command of the recently purchased 16-gunGoold's gun count includes swivel guns, but not the mortars of the bomb sloop Spitfire. Half (or fewer) of this count were carriage-mounted cannon. Other references indicate Canceaux carried 8 cannon, and Halifax carried 6. sloop HMS Canceaux. Canceaux, with Mowat in command, conducted a hydrographic survey of the coast of North America from the estuary of the Saint Lawrence River to Boston. While so engaged, Mowat was ordered to Portsmouth, New Hampshire in December, 1774, to protect military supplies at Fort William and Mary. Paul Revere alerted the local militia of rumored British seizure of munitions there; gunpowder was removed from the fort by patriots before Mowat arrived, and a colonial maritime pilot ran Canceaux aground in the Piscataqua River estuary. It was several days before the tide refloated Canceaux. Mowat patrolled the New England coast for smugglers until ordered to Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) in March, 1775 to assist a loyalist shipbuilder who was attempting to defy the Continental Association boycott on goods manufactured in Great Britain. Mowat was temporarily taken prisoner by militia from Brunswick, Maine during Thompson's War a few weeks after the battles of Lexington and Concord.Goold, William The Burning of Portland 19 February 1873 Canceaux resumed coastal patrols after Falmouth loyalists negotiated Mowat's release. Mowat was ordered to undertake a punitive mission following the battle of Machias to \\"chastize\\" the seaports of Marblehead, Salem, Gloucester, Ipswich, Newburyport, Portsmouth, Saco, Falmouth, and Machias.Leamon, James S. Revolution Downeast: The War for American Independence in Maine (1995) University of Massachusetts Press pp.69-70 Mowat left Boston aboard Canceaux on 6 October 1775 in company with the 20-gun ship Cat, the 12-gun schooner HMS Halifax, the bomb sloop HMS Spitfire and the supply ship HMS Symmetry.Symmetry may have carried guns, because other references indicate she fired during the Battle of Bunker Hill; but Goold describes her as a magazine for the bomb sloop during this engagement. As a safety measure to prevent loss of a ship through accidental ignition of unfired incendiary carcasses, carcasses were transferred by lighter from a non-firing ship to the bomb sloop as needed. Mowat directed the flotilla's 9-hour bombardment in the Burning of Falmouth on 18 October 1775. Mowat was given command of the recently purchased 16-gun sloop HMS Albany in 1776. As captain of Albany, Mowat was the senior officer of a three-ship squadron formed with the 16-gun sloops HMS North and HMS Nautilus to defend Castine, Maine against the Penobscot Expedition. Mowat skillfully anchored the sloops so they blocked the harbor entrance while their broadsides could provide mutually supportive fire with British forces ashore. He moved 6-pounder cannon from the unengaged side of his squadron ashore for use by soldiers defending their incomplete fortifications. Mowat's squadron held the harbor against a flotilla of 15 ships mounting 290 guns; and his skillful deployment of naval artillery enabled the outnumbered British force to withstand a siege from 23 July 1779 until reinforcements arrived on 14 August 1779 to defeat the attacking colonial force. Mowat was promoted to Captain and given command of the 50-gun fourth rate ship of the line HMS Assistance in May 1795. Assistance sailed to Halifax Harbour in March, 1796 and captured the 40-gun French frigate Elizabeth on 28 August 1796. Captain Mowat died of apoplexy on 14 April 1798 while Assistance was cruising off Chesapeake Bay. He is buried in the Episcopal churchyard in Hampton, Virginia. Legacy A few years before his death, Mowat wrote A Relation of the Services in which I was Engaged in America, from 1759, to the close of the American War in 1783. It was never printed, but was described as a folio in an 1843 London book store advertisement. Late 19th century American historians of the Revolutionary War launched an exhaustive search for the manuscript, including substantial reward offers, in the hope it might provide missing information about the early battles in which Mowat had participated. A manuscript ultimately found in Edinburgh did not meet the mythical expectations evolved through the period of searching. There was no mention of the burning of Falmouth and little new information about the Penobscot expedition.

He attended school in Auckland and went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MB, CM in 1893 with first-class honours. His uncles were Lord Haldane and the Scottish physician and physiologist John Scott Haldane.  Career  He was resident surgeon at Auckland Hospital in New Zealand from 1894 to 1896. He went back to Edinburgh to gain his MD in 1899, and completed the diploma in public health from Cambridge University in 1901. From 1901 to 1904 he was the district officer of health in Auckland, followed by appointment as government bacteriologist from 1904 to 1908, government pathologist 1908 to 1914, and Auckland's district health officer from 1909. After an outbreak of bubonic plague in Auckland in 1902 he produced a detailed analysis of the pathology and public health problems in the city and surrounding districts. Similarly in a typhoid outbreak in Auckland in 1914 he undertook rigorous testing and quarantine and traced the outbreak to a temporary army camp on One Tree Hill. During World War 1 he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps and in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, returning in 1916 to a public health position reporting on outbreaks of pneumonia and meningitis in military camps in Trentham, Upper Hutt and Featherston. Makgill took charge of the public health management of the 1918 influenza epidemic. After the epidemic he appeared before the Epidemic Commission.

Maketū was also the first New Zealand Māori to be tried and punished based on British sovereignty over New Zealand. The murders on Motuarohia Island Maketū was the son of Ruhe of Waimate, a chief of the Ngāpuhi. Maketū was accused of the murder of 5 people on 20 November 1841 on Motuarohia Island in the Bay of Islands. He was accused of killing Thomas Bull (referred to in the later trial as Tamati Puru) with an adze. The explanation for this killing was that Thomas Bull had been mistreating Maketū. Maketū was accused of then killing his employer Elizabeth Roberton (a widow), her two children and Isabella Brind, who was the granddaughter of Rewa, a chief of the Ngai Tawake hapū of the Ngāpuhi iwi of Kerikeri. Isabella's parents were Moewaka (Rewa's daughter) and Captain William Darby Brind. He was also accused of setting Mrs Roberton's house on fire. The arguments among the Ngāpuhi as to the surrender of Maketū to the colonial authorities At first the Ngāpuhi refused to surrender Maketū to the colonial authorities for trial. Eventually Ruhe, the father, consented. It may be assumed that the death of Rewa's grandchild, for which utu\\"Traditional Maori Concepts, Utu\\" Ministry of Justice website [an act of reciprocation for the death] was due, had much to do with this decision. Hōne Heke had been absent from the Bay of Islands, and on his return he advocated among the Ngāpuhi for confrontation against the Government. A meeting of the Ngāpuhi was arranged by the Rev. Henry Williams at Paihia at the request of Tāmati Wāka Nene. The meeting took place on 16 December 1841 and including Ngāpuhi from Whangaroa and Hokianga, with upwards of a thousand being present. The meeting was turbulent with Heke expressing his opposition to the surrender of Maketū. When he rose to speak, he interrupted Paerau who was speaking and flourishing his hatchet at him. Upon this Whiria (Pōmare II) left the meeting as he did not want to be involved in fighting between the different hapū of the Ngāpuhi, which had occurred in 1830 in the so-called Girls' War. Heke did not persuade the Ngāpuhi to accept his position. The meeting ended with Heke and his supporters conducting a Haka on the beach at Paihia, firing their muskets, which were loaded with ball. Henry Williams prepared a statement of resolutions made by the Ngāpuhi who dissociated themselves from Maketū's action, which was signed by Tāmati Wāka Nene, Pomare II, Waikato, Rewa, and Ruhe (Maketū's father). This message was sent to George Clarke, who had been appointed by Lieutenant- Governor William Hobson as the 'Protector of Aborigines'. The message was published in The New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette. Ruhe seems to have been over-borne by the Ngāpuhi chiefs that supported the surrender of Maketū, as afterwards Ruhe appeared to regret his decision as he threatened to shoot George Clarke's cattle because he had taken his son prisoner to Auckland. The trial of Maketū for murder Beginning on 1 March 1842, Maketū was tried in the Supreme Court in Auckland with Chief Justice William Martin presiding. It was a first time that a Māori had been brought before the colonial courts. C.B. Brewer was only retained to appear as Maketū's legal counsel about an hour before the trial came on; he had no opportunity of communicating with Maketū, nor did he see the depositions before he came into court that morning. Brewer argued that the court did not have jurisdiction over Maketū, on the ground of the prisoner's ignorance of the crime of murder that was in the penal law of the colony, and of his having no possible means or opportunity of understanding the penal law of the colony. William Swainson, the prosecuting counsel, argued that there should be one rule for all people, whether Māori or Pākehā. Martin CJ ruled that Maketū could be tried and punished by the court. Maketū pleaded not guilty. The jury heard evidence of Maketū's confessions to the killings and he was convicted of murder by a jury and was sentenced to death. He was hanged at the corner of Queen and Victoria Streets in Auckland. On the morning of his execution, he requested to be baptised in the Anglican rite and took the Christian names \\"Wiremu Kīngi\\". Just prior to his execution, Maketū dictated a statement whereby he said it his execution was just because \\"it is my own doing\\" and that he had prayed to God to \\"wash my sins away\\". Maketū was approximately 16 when the crimes were committed. He was executed in Auckland on 7 March 1842. The aftermath of the trial Later in 1842, Swainson, who was the attorney general, wrote to the Colonial Office, giving his legal opinion that the proceedings was usurpation of Māori sovereignty and went beyond the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi. The response by James Stephen of the Colonial Office concluded \\"Mr Swainson may think this is unjust or impolitic or inconsistent with former Acts, but still it is done\\". Moon (2013) comments that \\"what made this extension of British law into Maori communities possible in the manner in which it happened was the 16 December 1841 resolution which the twenty chiefs signed.\\" These events were considered a turning point in the history of the Colony, as Hōne Heke became an antagonist to the colonial administration and began gathering support among the Ngāpuhi for a rebellion against the colonial administration, which occurred in 1845 with the Flagstaff War.

The organisation supports work on a broad range of health problems, but specialises in mental health. It is supported by Australian Rotary Clubs. History ARH was founded by Ian Scott, a member of the Rotary Club of Mornington, Victoria.Henningham, P. (2011). With Health in Mind: The Story of Australian Rotary Health. Parramatta: Australian Rotary Health. In 1981, Scott was so moved by the impact of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) on families that he resolved to set up a fund to support research on this and other family health problems. This resulted in the establishment of the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund (later called ARH) with Royce Abbey as the inaugural chair of the board. The Fund offered its first research grants in 1985. The Fund initially supported research on sudden infant death syndrome, including a project which showed that prone sleeping position of the infant was a major risk factor. An information campaign following this research led to a rapid fall in the deaths from SIDS in Australia.Jorm, A.F., Sawyer, M.G. & Gillett, J. (2011). Celebrating 30 years of Australian Rotary Health. Medical Journal of Australia, 194, 279-280. Subsequently, the Fund supported a number of areas of research, including environmental health problems of the aged, adolescent health and family health. From 2000, it began to specialise in support for mental illness research in recognition of the adverse effects that mental illness had on the health and wellbeing of children, youth and adults in Australia.Jorm, A.F., Sawyer, M.G. & Gillett, J. (2012). Australian Rotary Health: a major contributor to mental illness research and mental health awareness in Australia. Australasian Psychiatry, in press. ARH is currently the largest non-government funder of research in this area in Australia. In 2009, the name was changed from the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund to Australian Rotary Health because the organisation had broadened its scope to include community mental health awareness and education activities, in addition to support for research. Support for research ARH currently provides a number of types of support for mental illness research, including project grants, PhD scholarships and Post-doctoral Fellowships. In addition, it supports research into a wide range of other health problems with Funding Partner Grants, which involve Rotary Clubs raising money for a specific project and ARH providing matching support. ARH also supports students training as health professionals with Indigenous Health Scholarships, Rural Medical Scholarships and Rural Nursing Scholarships. In addition to the important research on SIDS, ARH has provided funding for a number of projects that have had a practical impact on Australia or have received awards for their importance. These include projects on: nutrition and mental health, clonidine added to psychostimulant medication for hyperactive and aggressive children, e-therapy for anxiety disorders, media reporting of suicide and mental health first aid guidelines. Community awareness and education activities ARH has broadened its activities to include many community awareness and education activities, particularly in the mental health area. They have included Community Mental Health Forums, Mental Health First Aid Workshops and training of young researchers to better communicate with the public. ARH also offers an annual Knowledge Dissemination Award through the Australasian Society for Psychiatric Research, for excellence in knowledge dissemination and research translation. Fund raising Most of the funds provided by ARH have come from donations by Rotarians. In order to broaden the donor base, ARH launched Hat Day in 2011 as an annual fund-raising event aimed at the general public.

He was born in Whangarei, Northland, New Zealand on 10 January 1843, the son of an early trader, also named Gilbert Mair. His brother was Major William Gilbert Mair. Life Raised amongst Maori, he was a fluent Maori speaker. During the attack on Auckland by the Ngāti Maniapoto and the Ngāti Hauā in 1863, Gilbert joined the Forest Rangers under William Jackson, as an ensign or trainee officer. He took part in the Invasion of Waikato against the Kingitanga forces, and became famous in late 1863 for entering into discussions with the rebels during the Battle of Orakau under a flag of truce. The government forces were aware that a number of women and children were in the stronghold and Mair pleaded with the rebels to let them out but they refused and one shot Mair in the shoulder.\\"Forest Rangers\\", R.Stowers (1996) Mair later became an lieutenant and lead Maori troops during Te Kooti's War between 1868 and 1872 which led to the defeat of Te Kooti's guerillas. Mair was awarded the New Zealand Cross, and a promotion to captain, for his role in an action in February 1870 in which he led a small body of Te Arawa troops and inflicted a significant losses to Te Kooti's forces, killing 20 warriors including two of Te Kooti's two key fighters, Peka Makarini (Peka MacLean) and Timoti Hakopa. In July 1871 Ropata Wahawaha, Tom Porter and Ngati Porou warriors were joined by Mair and Captain George Preece leading a taua (war party) of Arawa. Together they ranged through the Urewera Mountains, subjugating the Tuhoe and forcing them to hand over any fugitives they were sheltering. On 22 September 1871, Captains Mair and Preece started from Fort Galatea on another Urewera expedition. The Arawa forces unexpectedly came upon Te Kooti's camp, which was taken after a brief skirmish. Wi Heretaunga was captured. He was believed to a participant in the murders of Captain James Wilson and his family at Matawhero in November 1868. He was also accused of being involved in the Mohaka massacre in April 1869. It was decided, that he should be shot, and this summary execution was carried out. When in camp Te Kooti usually slept some distance away from his followers. This habit had saved him at Maraetahi and it did so again. He was almost killed but another man intercepted the bullet. He fired one shot and fled, naked, into the bush, and the hunt continued. Early in February 1872, Preece received good information, from Ngāi Tūhoe Ringatū, who had been part of Te Kooti's forces, about the whereabouts of Te Kooti, at the junction of the Waiau and Mangaone Streams in the Ureweras. On 13 February they found a camp that had been occupied only a few days previously. The next day they found a camp with a fire still burning and then spotted a group of people climbing the cliff on the opposite side of the flooded stream. One of them was Te Kooti. Shots were exchanged and the chase was on. Later the same day Nikora te Tuhi spotted Te Kooti in the distance and fired two shots at him. They both missed but they were the last shots fired in the New Zealand Wars. In the 1880s Mair was the government officer trusted with establishing friendly relationships with Rewi Maniapoto in order to facilitate the main trunk railway to enter the King Country.\\"Stories Without End\\", J. Binney, Bridget Williams (2010) On 19 September 1888, Mair married the artist, Kate Sperrey, in Wellington. The couple would have two children, John Gilbert and Kathleen Irene, who would become a noted artist under her married name as Airini Vane. Gilbert had previously had three children with the Ngāti Tūwharetoa woman, Keita Kupa.

Smith Shipbuilding Company in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin; launched on 15 January 1944; and commissioned on 24 July 1944. PC-823 served in the western Atlantic Ocean during World War II, being assigned to air-sea rescue duties during at least some of that time. On 11 February 1946, PC-823 decommissioned and transferred to the United States Maritime Commission. She was transferred to the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York on 18 May 1948, and renamed Ensign Whitehead as a training ship. Her name was struck from the Navy List in June 1948. In September 1949, she was transferred to the Republic of Korea Navy and renamed ROKS Baekdusan, (PC-701), and played a major part in the Battle of Korea Strait, the small naval battle fought on the first day of the Korean War in June 1950. The remains of her mast are kept in the South Korean naval academy. South Korea Baekdusan (PC-701) with South Korean flag painted on the side of the ship's superstructure On 11 November 1945, when the South Korean navy (ROKN) was established, the ROKN had only LCVPs and light wooden patrol ships. The first Chief of Naval Operations of the ROKN, Admiral Son Won-il, emphasized the necessity to have a new naval ship replacing the deteriorated ships. However, South Korea was extremely poor immediately after independence from the Imperial Japan. Neither natural resources nor economic means were available to purchase new ships. Therefore, the ROKN decided to gather the cost of a new ship by themselves, organizing the ‘Vessel Construction Finance Committee’ in June 1949. From top officers down to cadets, they paid 5%~10% of their salary, and some of the midshipmen sold scrap metal to earn more money; their wives helped to earn money by taking in laundry and sewing. After four months, ROKN gathered $15,000. However this amount of money was not nearly enough to buy a naval vessel. After hearing of the efforts of ROKN, the South Korean government provided $45,000 more, for a total $60,000. On 17 October 1949, South Korea finally acquired the Ensign Whitehead (the former USS PC-823), at that stage a training ship of the United States Merchant Marine Academy. Fifteen naval officers spent two months in the U.S. to fix her. The ship was in such poor condition that the only thing working was the engine. At last, on 26 December 1949 at New York, ROKN’s first ocean-going naval vessel, Baek-du-san (PC-701) was born. Sailing from New York, a 3-inch main deck gun was attached at the Hawaii Naval Station, and 100 shells were purchased at Guam. PC-701 finally arrived at Jinhae Naval Base, South Korea, on 10 April 1950, barely two months before the June 1950 outbreak of the Korean War. With only 100 rounds ammunition, the sailors could only practice aiming the main gun, not firing it. On the night of 25/26 June 1950, on the South Korean eastern coast, she patrolled against infiltrators from the north. About twenty miles from the key port of Busan its crew sighted an unidentified ship. The PC-701 challenged the ship using signal lights, but receiving no response, turned its searchlight on the intruder. The light revealed a 1,000 ton freighter with an estimated six hundred to one thousand soldiers crowded on her decks. Heavy machine guns were mounted aft on the freighter with which the freighter crew opened fire on PC-701. The gunfire struck PC-701's bridge, killing the helmsman and seriously wounding the officer of the deck. She returned fire and engaged in a running duel with the freighter. According to veterans of PC-701, to increase the accuracy and penetration, PC-701 closed to within 400 meters of the freighter. The sailors had to use their M1 Garands to prevent North Korean soldiers from swimming to PC-701. The freighter was sunk between Busan and Tsushima Island. This was the modern ROKN’s first battle and is known as Battle of Korea Strait. Except for the fortuitous position of the PC-701 and the fighting qualities of the craft's crew, the North Korean soldiers might have successfully landed at the vital port of Busan. The poor state of combat readiness at the port could easily have led to its loss. In such an event, not even the small toehold of Busan would have remained to support the U.N. counteroffensive in Korea. This single naval action may well have prevented the fall of South Korea.

The game focuses on the creation of a trade empire against several computer controlled opponents. Victory is achieved through a combination of infrastructure investments, the stock market, piracy, sabotage, and of course trade goods. Plot In the year 2375, Humans share the galaxy with four other races, the Colikars, Tesarians, Secanii, and the Krec N'had. Your fledgling trading company, consisting of a single port and a single ship, must, by the year 2500, expand by any means necessary to become the dominant trade empire in the galaxy. Three computer opponents will be pursuing the same goal. Gameplay There are numerous mechanics for the player to utilize in order to achieve victory. =Ships= Ships do the heavy lifting in the game. Without ships, the goods produced at planets can't be transported and the highest level goods can't be manufactured due to a lack of the appropriate resources. At the start of the game only a few ship types are available. As the game progresses new, more advanced ship types become available. Ships have several stats which determine its suitability for use. Range, Speed, Capacity, Efficiency, Drive, and Maintenance cost. =Planets= Planets generate all of the trade goods in the galaxy. These goods range from food, to passengers, to luxury goods. The higher in development a planet is, the more and the greater the variety of goods that are produced. Once the highest levels of development can be reached the most expensive, and thus profitable, goods can be manufactured. To gain access to a planet, a bid must be made on a planet which does not already have a deal with another trade company. The player must open negotiations with such a planet and if their demands are agreed to, they will ally themselves with the players trade company. The demands include a monthly rent paid by the player, the delivery of a specified good at regular intervals, and an agreement to build a specified piece of infrastructure on the planet within a certain timeframe. The demand for monthly rent is made for every planet, with the other two demands being optional and dependent on the developmental level of the planet. Planets have morale which can be modified by in-game factors. Investing in planetary infrastructure can often help improve the morale of a planet and ensure docking rights are not lost. Should a planet be lost to an unhappy local populace, the player must begin negotiations for docking rights again. The higher the developmental level of the planet, the more infrastructure will be needed to keep the planet happy. =Trade Goods= Trade goods include fuel, food, passengers, and exotic goods such as wine and weapons. Each race produces different high-end goods than it consumes. =Stock Market= Each trading company has stock which can be sold on the market for an infusion of cash. Buying out the competition, by accumulating a majority of their stock, is possible. Stock can be bought and sold throughout the game, making it possible to sell lots of stock early for an early boost and then buy it back when the other companies sell off the shares they own. =Piracy= Pirates can be hired to harass the competition. They can be paid to harass the player as well. When a pirate attacks there are only a couple of options, pay them off, try to run, or fight back. The correct action to take will depend heavily on the specific ship being threatened and the upgrades that it has been outfitted with. =Sabotage= Sabotage missions can be undertaken to hurt the competitions bottom line. Of course the competition can do the same to the player. =News Events= A very basic mechanic, News Events inform the player of all the important events such as new ships, engines, or weapon systems which have become available. Sudden changes in the markets may also be announced throughout the game, giving the player the chance to make a quick profit. Critical reception A reviewer for Next Generation focused on the lack of anything to do in the game besides bid for landing rights and choose cargo: \\"No cut-throat strategy for undermining the competition's prices, no sabotage of trading routes, no space battles - not even the occasional price war.\\" He recommended that players get \\"much better\\" business sims such as Transport Tycoon or Capitalism instead, and gave it 1 out of 5 stars. World Village (Gamer's Zone) wrote \\"The plot was a little thin for my taste, but if reading the business section of the paper excites you, then this game would be a must for you. The main weakness that I see in this program is lack of originality. I see parts of Railroad Tycoon, Civilization, Sim City among others, as well as the obvious connection to Air bucks v1.2. Nothing wrong with recycling older programs, especially as hardware improvements allow the newer versions to make improvements on game performance. That is what happened with this game. Unfortunately, it has a rushed feeling and fails to capitalize on the improvements there were put in the game.\\"http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/spacebuk.htm Computer Gaming World said \\"If you love to create ornate moving sculptures that generate endless money but do very little else interesting, then SPACE BUCKS will have some appeal for you. Set at its hardest level, the game offers two or three hours of challenge before your empire grows to the point that nothing can really harm it and you simply sit around absorbing planets from your competitors and doing more and more unwieldy upgrades to your entire fleet. Other than that, it is pretty to look at, but definitely no AIR BUCKS in Space.\\" Computer Games Magazine wrote \\"Dealing with manufacturing, the bank and stock market, and random events do add a few things (bowling pins and knives?), but there still aren't a lot of different things to do (as in, say, Sim City or Capitalism). Despite this, you have to watch these things very closely, and it is easy for things to go critical very quickly. At the beginner level I played (and quickly lost) four games before I'd gotten a business that was even barely stable (and I was at the bottom of the pack). Maybe I just don't have a nose for business, but my attention wasn't strongly held. Beginning business sim fans might get more out of Space Bucks than I did, but I suspect advanced gamers will want to stick with a more detailed game like Capitalism.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20031103233809/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/005/087/space_bucks_review.html References External links * Category:1996 video games Category:Business simulation games Category:Simulation video games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Space Bucks"},{"id":"34576438","text":"Homoeographa lanceolella is a species of snout moth.

She served in World War I as the founding Matron-in-Chief of the New Zealand Army Nursing Service, and was one of the first nurses to receive the Florence Nightingale Medal.  Early life  Maclean was born in Sofala, New South Wales, Australia on 25 February 1859. Her parents were Emily (née Strong) and Harold Maclean. She was educated at private schools and was inspired by her father's nurse to become a nurse herself. Maclean trained at Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, completing her certificate in 1893.  Career  After completing her training, Maclean nursed in a number of hospitals in New South Wales and Victoria, including the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and Kogarah Hospital in Sydney. In 1905 she travelled to England and trained in midwifery. On her return to Sydney, she successfully applied for the position of Assistant Inspector of Hospitals in Wellington, and moved to New Zealand in 1906 to replace Grace Neill, who was retiring. She held the position for 17 years. During her tenure, Maclean was responsible for establishing schemes for rural district nursing, native health nurses and school nurses. She also oversaw the extension of the St. Helen's hospitals for midwifery training. As Assistant Inspector, with Jessie Bicknell and Amelia Bagley, she played a major role in the implementation of the Midwives Act 1904 and setting midwifery standards. She also established the New Zealand Army Nursing Service (NZANS) and led the first large contingent of New Zealand nurses overseas in World War I, embarking with 50 nurses on the Rotorua in April 1915. Among other tasks, Maclean designed the NZANS's uniform. In 1907, Maclean proposed the establishment of a journal for nurses to exchange ideas and keep up to date with the latest international developments in nursing. She produced and funded the magazine herself, with the first issue appearing in January 1908. Maclean continued to operate the journal until her retirement in 1923; she then sold it to the Registered Nurses Association, but retained the position of editor until her death. After some encouragement during her travels around the country on inspections, the four provincial nursing associations amalgamated in 1909 into the New Zealand Trained Nurses Association. Maclean was elected the first national president and remained active in the organisation for the remainder of her life. In 1923, Maclean retired from the Department of Health and wrote her autobiography, Nursing in New Zealand, which was published in 1932. Maclean died in Wellington on 2 September 1932 and is buried in Karori Cemetery.

Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Macky earned a law degree from Auckland University College and set himself up as a sole practitioner. He joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in 1915 and was commissioned as an officer in the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. He served during the Senussi Campaign in the Middle East and on the Western Front. His leadership during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette earned him the Military Cross. After the war he returned to his legal career. He was also a senior officer in the Territorial Force (TF) in which he commanded an infantry brigade. In 1937, Macky was one of four TF colonels that publicly protested reforms that reduced personnel and affected morale in the TF. He was punished by being placed on the retired list. Recalled to duty in the Second World War, he commanded the 21st Battalion during the Battle of Greece. Repatriated to New Zealand after the battle, he commanded the Bay of Islands Fortress Area until he was placed on the reserve of officers. After the war he returned to his law firm for which he was practice manager. He died in 1981 at the age of 90. Early life Macky, the son of a clerk, was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 February 1891. He was educated at Prince Albert College and then went onto Auckland University College to study law. He graduated with a law degree in 1912 and shortly afterwards was admitted as a solicitor. A year later he set up his own law practice as a barrister. First World War In 1915, Macky volunteered to join the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) which had been raised for service in the First World War. He was posted to the 1st Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade as a second lieutenant in October that year. He served in the Middle East during the brief Senussi Campaign before the brigade, as part of the newly formed New Zealand Division, embarked for the Western Front in April 1916. The first major engagement of the division's service in Europe was the Battle of Flers–Courcelette in September 1916. On 15 September, during the battle, Macky, newly promoted to a full lieutenant, won a Military Cross for his leadership of two platoons that dealt with a German counterattack. Promoted to temporary captain in October 1916, Macky was wounded two months later. He was evacuated to England to recuperate from his wounds before returning to France. His rank was made substantive in April 1918. Following the cessation of hostilities, he was sent into Germany with the New Zealand Division for occupation duties. On his return to New Zealand in May 1919, he was discharged from the NZEF. Interwar period On his return to civilian life, Macky resumed his legal career but maintained an interest in the military by joining the Territorial Force (TF). Previously a sole practitioner, he went into partnership with another solicitor in 1920. Much of the firm's work was in property conveyancing work and in 1928, Macky, having purchased his partner's share of the practice, merged his firm into what later became Russell McVeagh. Many of the partners of the firm, like Macky, were officers in the TF. Macky was promoted to major in the TF in 1926 and to colonel in 1931, at which time he was in command of the Auckland Regiment. Six years later, he was appointed commander of the 1st New Zealand Infantry Brigade. =Four Colonel's Revolt= In 1937, the TF was the subject of reforms carried out by Major General John Duigan, the Chief of General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces, to improve efficiencies in the organisation. Several regiments were disbanded and were reconstituted as battalions while a number of senior officers were placed in retirement. The morale of the TF declined as those senior officers who were left raised concerns, disregarded by Duigan, over the state of the army. Macky was one of four colonels in the TF who publicly protested the reforms in what became known as the Four Colonels' Revolt. This was a breach of military regulations, which prohibited military personnel from communicating with journalists unless they had permission to do so. Instead of a court-martial, which he feared would generate public sympathy for the colonels, Duigan placed all four officers on the retired list as punishment. The revolt did result in greater public awareness of the poor state of New Zealand's military, but little was done to rectify the situation. Second World War Despite his involvement in the revolt of 1937, following the outbreak of the Second World War Macky was appointed commander of the 21st Battalion which was being raised for service overseas as part of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). The battalion shipped out to England with the 2nd Echelon of the 2NZEF in May and served garrison duty in the south of England for several months. By early 1941, the British Government anticipated an invasion of Greece by the Germans and decided to send troops to support the Greeks. The 2nd New Zealand Division, which included 21st Battalion, was one of a number of Allied units dispatched to Greece in early March. When the expected invasion began, Macky's battalion was involved in a rearguard action at Platamón for two days from 14 April. Shortly afterwards, along with two Australian battalions, it carried out a delaying action at Piniós Gorge but was cut off and became fragmented. Macky had misjudged the placement of his forces and German tanks managed to get through the gorge and force the retreat of his battalion. He, along with 39 other personnel of the battalion, were able to evade capture and made his way to Crete to rejoin what was left of the battalion. However, he was suffering from dysentery and was hospitalised. Although he was later mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Greece, the divisional commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, dismissed him as battalion commander for his handling of the action at Piniós Gorge. Repatriated to New Zealand in September 1941, the following year Macky was appointed commander of the Bay of Islands Fortress Area. He served in this capacity until February 1944, at which stage he was placed on the officer's reserve. Later life After the war, Macky returned to his law firm where he acted as practice manager. In his retirement, he remained active as a legal consultant but also increased his involvement in charitable work. He died on 4 October 1981, survived by two children. His wife had predeceased him in 1978.

Born in 1861 in Ireland, Mackesy moved to New Zealand in the 1890s and took up farming in Whangarei. A soldier in the Volunteer Force, he volunteered for service with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) on the outbreak of the First World War. He was commander of Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment, serving briefly at Gallipoli, and more substantially during the campaign in the Sinai and Palestine. From April 1917 he carried out administrative roles for the remainder of the war, apart from periods of leave. Discharged from the NZEF in late 1919 he returned to his farm in New Zealand. He died of heart failure in 1925. Early life Charles Ernest Randolph Mackesy was born in Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland on 9 January 1861 to Ernest Randolph Mackesy and his wife. His father, a former officer in the 97th Regiment of Foot, had recently purchased a farm near Whangarei, in New Zealand, but died there a few months prior to the birth of his son. As a child, his family contributed to Mackesy's education which he received while living in several European countries. As a young man, he moved to the United States where he met Jessie Adam. The couple was married in the town of Dalis Peak, Kansas, in November 1880. New Zealand In the 1890s, Mackesy moved to Whangarei to take up farming on his father's land which had been close to being repossessed due to non-payment of rates. His wife, and their three children, followed shortly afterwards. He soon turned the farm into a profitable enterprise and later set up a land agency. He became active in politics, unsuccessfully contesting the in the electorate. Another interest of Mackesy's was the military and in 1900, he joined the Marsden Mounted Rifles, a unit of the Volunteer Force. A successful citizen soldier, by 1911 he had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of the 11th (North Auckland) Mounted Rifles. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, Mackesy volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) being raised for military service overseas in aid of the war effort. He was given command of the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment (AMR) and oversaw its training at Epson Camp. Sent to the Middle East with the main body of the NZEF, the AMR, sans their horses which were left back in Egypt, served at Gallipoli from May 1915. He was a well regarded officer, noted for his initiative but he also gained a reputation for being outspoken. The AMR, on arriving at Gallipoli, initially defended the lines at Walker's Ridge and here Mackesy fought in the Third attack on Anzac Cove, at one stage countermanding orders to attack when he spotted a build up of Turkish forces in the opposing trenches. Shortly afterwards he was sent to Egypt to take command of the base of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. While stationed in Egypt he was mentioned in despatches twice. After the end of the fighting in Gallipoli, Mackesy served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as commander of the AMR and at times was acting commander of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. An advocate for British-Israeli relations, he gained particular satisfaction when the AMR advanced into Palestine. He gave up command of the AMR in April 1917, to become Administrator of the Khan Yunus-Deir El Belah area. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1917, Mackesy was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year. He then briefly commanded a training regiment, having received the temporary rank of colonel, and went back to New Zealand on furlough in late 1917. He returned to the Middle East in early 1918 and took command of New Zealand training units in Egypt. He finished the war as Military Governor of Es Sal-Amman District in Jordan and supervised the transfer of power back to Arab administrators. He was mentioned in depatches for a third time early in 1919 and later that year was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for \\"valuable services rendered in connection with Military Operations in Egypt\\". Later life Discharged from the NZEF in November 1919, Mackesy returned to his farm. In 1921 he expanded his land agency business, opening an office in Auckland. In January 1925 he remarried, his first wife having died in August 1920. He died before the end of the year of heart failure, survived by his second wife and two sons, a third son having been killed at Gallipoli. Mackesy Park in Whangarei is named for him.

Early Life and Emigration to New Zealand James Mackay was born in London, the eldest son of a banker. He was one of eight children born to James Mackay senior and Ann (née Charles) between 1829 and 1848. Two cousins were also raised with the family, the oldest of which, Alexander Mackay, was two years younger than James Mackay junior and described by him as being like a brother. He also had two half sisters from James Mackay senior's second marriage after the death of Ann in 1860. In 1845 the family emigrated from London to Nelson Province in New Zealand on the Slains Castle. They established themselves just north of Nelson Town in an area called Wakapuaka on a farm they named Drumduan. Their land bordered on Maori reserve, and as James Mackay junior embraced colonial life, working twelve hour days on the farm as well as keeping up with his studies, he also became fluent in Maori. Run-holder and Assistant Native Secretary In 1852, when James Mackay turned 21, with the help of his father he established a cattle run below Farewell Spit in Golden Bay. At that time Golden Bay was completely isolated from the rest of province, with a population consisting almost entirely of Maori living in several villages along the coast. In 1855 the first three families of agricultural settlers arrived, and at about the same time a sawmill was established at Motupipi. There was soon conflict between the sawyers and local Maori, and concerned about the way it was dealt with, Mackay appealed to the Native Secretary Donald McLean to appoint him into a position to mediate between Maori and Pakeha (Europeans). The request was granted in 1857 after gold was discovered in the Aorere Valley and a large population of both Maori and Pakeha arrived at the diggings, which centred on the new town of Collingwood. Mackay was appointed Assistant Native Secretary on a salary of £100, but the salary for the amount of work involved was not enough, so he lobbied for a more substantial position. After the Goldfields Act came into force in 1859, which brought official law and order to the Collingwood Goldfield, Mackay was appointed Warden, Coroner and Resident Magistrate. Purchase of Kaikōura and the West Coast  The Okarito Memorial Obelisk commemorates three key events of significance to the West Coast: Abel Tasman's sighting of 1642, James Cook's voyage of 1770, and James Mackay's purchase of Westland in 1860 Prior to the discovery of gold, Mackay's want for more land for his cattle sparked a series of explorations. He followed rumours from local Maori of large tracts of land existing in the mountainous hinterland of Golden Bay. He also travelled south along the West Coast as far as the Grey River, where he discovered plenty of land ready for settlement. He did not take up the land himself, however, because when he returned north the gold rush had set in and he was suddenly kept very busy selling his stock and mediating disputes in an unofficial capacity until his role of Assistant Native Secretary was confirmed. While at the Grey River Mackay learnt from local Maori (Poutini Ngai Tahu) that they wanted settlers to come, but first the land needed to be purchased from them. He forwarded a letter addressed to the Native Secretary Donald McLean voicing their concerns about a previous deal whereby their land had been wrongfully sold to the Government by the Ngati Toa tribe. His report of the value of the land, and the need to extinguish the Poutini Ngai Tahu title before settlement could begin, brought that and a similar issue at Kaikōura to the attention of McLean. McLean appointed Mackay Acting Land Purchase Commissioner with instructions to purchase both the Kaikōura block and the entire West Coast. Mackay set out for Kaikōura in February 1859 with his cousin Alexander to keep him company. He expected to conclude the purchase quickly but found the local Maori (Ngāi Tahu) much more numerous and aware of the value of the land than expected. They demanded £5000 and 200,000 acres of reserves, but Mackay was instructed to pay only £150 and allocate 10-100 acres per person. In the end he leaned on the fact that the Government had already purchased the land from Ngati Toa, and feigned packing up and leaving them with nothing, which compelled them to come back to the table and accept £300 and 5556 acres of reserves. He justified the over allocation of reserves by reporting that the greater portion of the land was \\"of the most useless and worthless description\\". In April James and Alexander Mackay set out for the West Coast. They joined up with the Nelson surveyor John Rochfort and his chainmen before reaching the Alps, and caught out in snow, spent three weeks making the crossing. James and Alexander then waited on the West Coast for all the Maori of importance to assemble at Arahura, the centre of their greenstone (pounamu) industry. When negotiations at last began towards the end of July, Mackay again found the Maori demanding more money and reserves than he was permitted to allocate. They wanted £2,500 and an estimated area of 200,000 acres, and this time they were unmoved by his threats of dealing with Ngati Toa instead. When negotiations broke down, he was forced to go to Auckland to receive new instructions. Mackay returned to the West Coast the following year, exploring an overland route from Nelson to the Grey Valley on the way. Negotiations resumed at Poherua, just north of the Okarito Lagoon, on 21 April 1860. Previously Mackay had offered £200 and 800 acres of reserves, now he offered £300 and 6000 acres of reserves, which the Poutini Ngai Tahu accepted, stressing that their greenstone should be protected with a large reserve at the Arahura. While allocating their various reserves, he reluctantly allowed them to keep the landing at the Grey River, even though it was an obvious place for a future town (Greymouth). The signing of the deed of purchase took place at the Grey River on 21 May 1860.  Hauraki District Commissioner and Compensation Court When Mackay resumed his duties at the Collingwood in June 1860, part of his role involved monitoring local Te Ati Awa, who were closely related to the Te Ati Awa fighting a war against the Government over a block of land in Taranaki. In 1863, just prior to the second war in Taranaki and the Government invasion of the Waikato, the Maori King sent emissaries to Collingwood to invite Maori to return to land they had been forced to leave during the Musket Wars of the 1820s. After consulting with Governor George Grey, Mackay arrested the emissaries and took them to Auckland to face sedition charges at the Supreme Court. The men were later found not guilty, but while waiting for the trial, Grey commissioned Mackay to go to the Hauraki District to mediate between local \\"friendly\\" Maori and soldiers garrisoned there. He went further to convince several \\"hostile\\" Maori chiefs to turn away from the Maori King Movement, give up their arms, and swear allegiance to the Queen. As a result of Mackay's success, Grey appointed him a Civil Commissioner of the Hauraki District, and so he moved permanently to the North Island. After moving north Mackay became involved with the Compensation Court, firstly as a judge and then as an advocate for the Crown. The purpose of the Compensation Court was to investigate claims of Maori who believed their lands had been wrongly confiscated during the Taranaki, Waikato and Tauranga wars. The confiscations enabled the Government to take control of Maori lands, firstly directly through confiscation, then indirectly through compensation, which converted tribally owned land into individual titles. Once Maori land was fragmented, it was much easier to negotiate with individuals for purchase of the land for Pakeha settlement, instead of having to gain consensus from the entire tribe. The Native Land Court then continued the work of establishing individual titles for Maori land. Cartoon of commissioner James Mackay addressing gold miners at Thames entitled, \\"The Thames Autocrat.\\"  Thames Goldfield Warden It had long been known that gold existed in the Thames or Waihou Valley at the base of the Coromandel Peninsula. The only problem was that many of the local Maori were what was termed Land Leaguers, with affiliations to the Maori King. They refused to allow Pakeha to have access to the land, which kept the entire area closed. In 1867 Mackay negotiated to allow a part of the land to be prospected. The success of the prospectors caused a gold rush, and so Mackay moved to the new township of Shortland to become warden of the Thames Goldfield. He spent the next several years negotiating with individual Maori land owners to open up more ground for gold mining. By the end of 1868 he had extended the Thames Goldfield to the Hikutaia River, but the prize of the Ohinemuri, which was thought to be rich with gold, remained elusive. In August 1868 Mackay resigned from all of his Government positions and began dealing privately in partnership with Wirope Hoterene (Willoughby Shortland) Taipari, who owned the land upon which the towns of Shortland and Graham's Town were built. The Government asked Mackay to reconsider his resignation because there was a lot of unfinished work which only he knew how to deal with. He agreed, but only if he could continue with private business at the same time. It was contentious among Thames business people that Mackay could set their rents in favour of his business partner Taipari. The situation continued for a year until a suitable person was found to replace him as Warden.  Public and professional life  In December 1869 Mackay became a member of the Auckland Provincial Council representing Thames. He resigned after filing for bankruptcy eight and a half months later. At the end of September 1870, he applied for and was granted a discharge from bankruptcy. He then regained a seat on the Provincial Council after a member from Thames retired. In 1872 the Minister of Public Works asked Mackay to return to purchasing land for the Government. At that time he was involved with private sales on the Coromandel Peninsula. He agreed to put aside his private dealings on the condition that he could finish negotiating the sale of kauri timber leases upon the same land which the government wanted to buy. Mackay therefore sold the timber on the land with 40-year leases, and then bought the land on behalf of the Crown, subject to the leases. In 1873 Mackay was sent to the Waikato to keep the peace. A man named Timothy Sullivan had been murdered for trespassing on land belonging to the Maori King in April of that year, and there was fear of renewed hostilities. Mackay took control of the Waikato, both civil and military, until the end of June 1874, and managed to prevent the incident from escalating into another war. When he returned from the Waikato he went back to negotiations with the Maori with great success. He gained a victory over the Land Leaguers by acquiring the first land sales in the Aroha Block on behalf of the Government. He followed this up by opening up the Ohinemuri for gold mining in 1875. In May 1875, there was an inquiry into mining licenses which had been in Mackay's possession and had been illegally issued for the Ohinemuri Goldfield. At the same time, George Grey, now a member of parliament for City West in Auckland, began to call Mackay to account for having conducted private business in the Coromandel while being in Government employment. It was an attempt to break Mackay's personal hold over the now very important Hauraki District. In July 1875 Mackay moved to Wellington to defend himself against the charges. He justified his land purchasing conduct with a report to Parliament in August, which was very scathing towards Grey, and his name was cleared of illegally issuing Ohinemuri mining rights in October. In December 1875, despite already being a member for City West, Grey put himself forward as a candidate for the Thames seat. On nomination day Mackay also put himself forward, using his nomination speech as a means of attacking Grey. Mackay won the show of hands, but he withdrew when a poll was called for. He then entered a formal protest against Grey being eligible to stand on grounds that he was already an elected Member of Parliament. Though technically correct according to Parliamentary Practice, Mackay's protest was dismissed by an inquiry in July 1876. In October 1877 Grey formed a Ministry to become Premier of New Zealand. When the Native Minister wanted Mackay to be his Under Secretary in early 1879, Grey wouldn't allow it. Also the Government refused to pay Mackay a large commission still owing for land which he had purchased on their behalf. In April 1879, without official title or position, the Native Minister deputed Mackay to enquire into an escalating situation in Taranaki. The Maori of Parihaka were attempting to block Pakeha occupation of their land by peacefully occupying it themselves. After investigating the situation, Mackay recommended that there should be a commission set up with both Pakeha and Maori on its panel. But instead the Maori were arrested and the situation deteriorated until November 1881, when Parihaka was raided by police and its people either jailed or expelled. After Grey's resignation in October 1879, Mackay was again able to gain Government appointments. He spent a year on the West Coast as Warden of the Goldfields at Greymouth. He was forced to resign after declaring bankruptcy in October 1880, very much out of pocket and still awaiting money owed to him for land sales in the north. When his discharge came two months later, he had returned to the North Island, where he took up jobs such as private land purchasing on commission, advocating for people at the Native Land Court and translating during Court sessions. Mackay attempted to enter the House of Representatives as a member for the Coromandel in 1881 and 1887, but lost at the polls to Alfred Cadman. In 1896 Cadman accused Mackay of having misled the Government in 1872 when purchasing on their behalf at the Coromandel. Mackay responded, \\"I have been before the public for years, my private conduct may have been not altogether right, as I am subject to the same weaknesses as other men. But I can defy the world to say where I did wrong or acted in any way for my private interest against that of the general public\\". Personal life and death In 1862 Mackay married Eliza Sophia Braithwaite in Nelson. She was six years his junior, the daughter of a prominent civil engineer. In 1864 they moved to Parnell in Auckland, where they had a son in July 1865 (who only lived for eight months) and a daughter in March 1867. During the second half of 1867 they moved to Shortland after Mackay became warden of the Thames Goldfield. In 1869 Mackay went to Auckland and sent Eliza a letter of separation. Mackay and his wife were separated for many years while she remained in Shortland and he was living in Auckland or dealing in the Coromandel. They also had several reconciliations, living together in Shortland, Wellington, Greymouth, Gisborne and Paeroa. During their time apart Mackay was in relationships with at least two other women: Ema Te Aouru, otherwise known as Puahaere; and Margaret Sullivan, who lived with him as his wife in Freeman's Bay, Auckland. Puahaere was a high ranking chief from the Coromandel. She was the daughter of Aotea Te Paratene and King Tūkāroto Matutaera Pōtatau Te Wherowhero Tāwhiao. Mackay and Puahaere had a daughter named Parearohi (also known as Arihia). They also possibly had a son. Mackay's relationship with Margaret Sullivan probably came to an end after he almost died in 1892 from self-harm. By 1895 he was living again with Eliza. They settled at Paeroa where he worked as a mining advocate and licensed interpreter. By 1897 they lived on the same or adjoining property as their daughter and her husband at a farm called Danesfort, just outside of Paeroa. In 1911, a year before his death, Mackay was visited by the historian James Cowan at his house in Paeroa. Cowan described him as lying paralysed, and subsisting on a tiny compassionate Government allowance of £1 per week. Mackay died in 1912 at the age of 80. Eliza died in 1915 at the age of 77, and was buried next to her husband at Paeroa.

Composed of battalions of volunteers raised in the city of Kingston upon Hull (the Hull Pals) for 'Kitchener's Army', it formed part of 31st Division, It first served in Egypt defending the Suez Canal between January and March 1916. It then left for the Western Front where it was at Serre on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916, though its battalions escaped the worst of the disaster. It continued to serve on the Western Front for the rest of the war, including hard fighting at Oppy Wood, against the German Spring Offensive and in the final Hundred Days Offensive. Origin Alfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army. On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular Army, and on 11 August the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. The Fourth New Army, 'K4', was authorised by Army Order 389 on 14 September, and by November it was arranged that this would consist of the 30th to 35th Divisions, comprising the 89th to 106th Brigades.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2, 8, 24, Appendix 1.Becke, Pt 3b, Appendices 1 & 2.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 11–19. The Fourth New Army consisted of new Service battalions raised by the existing Reserve and Extra Reserve battalions of the Regular Army (the Special Reserve), and the original 92nd Brigade consisted of the 14th and 15th Battalions of the Kings Royal Rifle Corps and the 14th and 15th Battalions of the Rifle Brigade. These were formed in October 1914 at Sheerness (KRRC) and Southend-on-Sea (RB). However, in April 1915 there was a change in policy: the K4 battalions became Reserve battalions with the role of training reinforcements for the K1–K3 Service battalions serving overseas. The six K4 divisions were broken up – 92nd Brigade became 4th Reserve Brigade – and their numbers re-assigned to the first six K5 divisions. Thus 113th Brigade of 38th Division was renumbered as 92nd Brigade of 31st Division.Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix 1b.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 40.KRRC at Long, Long Trail.RB at Long, Long Trail. The flood of volunteers responding to Kitchener's call to action had overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised on 10 December 1914, many of its constituent units were being organised as 'Pals battalions' under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, pp. 37–42.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 26–40.Jackson, pp. 14–7.Middlebrook, pp. 9–11. 92nd Brigade consisted of four battalions (the Hull Pals) that had been raised at Kingston upon Hull on the initiative of Charles Wilson, 2nd Baron Nunburnholme, as Lord-Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire and President of the East Riding Territorial Association. This was unusual because most of the county Territorial Associations were fully engaged with recruiting and equipping their existing Territorial Force (TF) units and had no time for the early New Army units. By contrast, Lord Nunburnholme and the East Riding TA were simultaneously raising the 1st Hull Heavy Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery for the 11th (Northern) Division of K1, and in 1915 also raised the 124th (2nd Hull) and 146th (3rd Hull) Heavy Batteries and the 31st (Hull) Divisional Ammunition Column.Becke, Pt 3a, p. 21.Drake, pp. 44–7. The four Hull Pals battalions were assigned to the East Yorkshire Regiment as the 10th–13th (Service) Battalions.War Office Instructions July 1915, Appendix VI.War Office Instruction No. 183, September 1915.Bilton, Hull Pals.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, pp. 38–9. Order of Battle The composition of the brigade was as follows:Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 11–19.31 Division at Long, Long Trail.East Riding Regiment at Long, Long Trail. * 10th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (1st Hull) – the 'Hull Commercials' * 11th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (2nd Hull) – the 'Hull Tradesmen' * 12th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (3rd Hull) – the 'Hull Sportsmen'; disbanded 8 February 1918 * 13th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (4th Hull) – the 'T'others'; disbanded 8 February 1918 * 92/1 and 92/2 Trench Mortar Batteries – formed on 11 April 1916; became a single battery by 12 June 1916 * 92nd Brigade Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps – joined on 20 May 1916; transferred to 31st Divisional Machine Gun Battalion 3 March 1918 * 11th (Accrington Pals) Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment – transferred from 94th Brigade 11 February 1918 Service Local training for the Hull Pals ended in late May and early June when the units of 31st Division began to assemble at South Camp, Ripon, where brigade training began in earnest. Musketry training was finally begun in August, and in September the division moved to Hurdcott Camp at Fovant where the brigade received SMLE service rifles and carried out final intensive battle training on Salisbury Plain.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 61–5. =Egypt= On 29 November 1915 the division received warning orders to join the British Expeditionary Force in France, and advance parties set out for the embarkation ports of Folkestone and Southampton. At the last minute, the destination was changed to Egypt, the advance parties were recalled, and on 7 December the troops embarked at Devonport.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 67–9. The division reached Port Said between 24 December and 23 January 1916 and went into the Suez Canal defences at Qantara. On 26 February orders arrived to reverse the process and on 1 March the division began re-embarking at Port Said. It unloaded at Marseille between 6 and 16 March and then concentrated in the Somme area as part of the BEF. It remained on the Western Front for the rest of the war.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 69–102. =Serre= The brigade was first introduced to trench warfare on 21 March by groups being attached to the 36th (Ulster) Division in the line. On 28 March the 10th and 11th Bns relieved Ulster battalions in front of Beaumont-Hamel and Y Ravine, with 12th and 13th Bns in support. Although this was a quiet sector of the line, the battalions suffered their first casualties during this short tour, mainly from German Minenwerfers (trench mortars). Shortly afterwards 31st Division formed its own light trench mortar batteries (TMBs), with the Hull Pals contributing men to 92/1 and 92/2 TMBs for 92 Bde. 10th Battalion also provided working parties to assist the 252nd Tunnelling Company, Royal Engineers, digging the Hawthorn Ridge mine that was to be exploded to launch the forthcoming Battle of the Somme. Over the next weeks the battalions took their turns in the routine of trench holding, working parties, patrolling and trench raiding, with a constant drain on manpower from shelling and snipers.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 102–29. 92 Brigade was to be in support of 31st Division's assault on the first day of the Battle (1 July). It held the front line trenches during the British bombardment in the days leading up to the battle, suffering significant casualties from the German counter-bombardment (about 100 killed and wounded for 10th Bn alone). The night before the battle, working parties of 10th Bn were out in No man's land cutting lanes through the British barbed wire for the assaulting troops to pass through. It then withdrew into the support trenches, leaving D Company to hold the front line while the assault went in. 93 and 94 Brigades went 'over the top' at 07.30 on 1 July, 10 minutes after the explosion of the nearby Hawthorn Ridge mine had alerted the enemy. Their objective was the village of Serre. The advancing lines were almost annihilated by German machine guns and shellfire, and only a few parties got into the enemy front line, where they remained pinned down all day.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 129–36.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 441–8.Horsfall & Cave, pp. 59–71.Jackson, pp. 99–114.Middlebrook, pp. 122–31, 150–1. 31st Division found it impossible to get any support across the fire-swept No man's land for the rest of the day. 92 Brigade was ordered to renew the attack with two battalions during the night. Luckily, this order was cancelled: even if the brigade could have been brought up through the shattered communication and jumping-off trenches, which were full of dead and wounded, there were no British troops left in the German positions. D Company of 10th Bn had held the British trenches all day and were exhausted, but continued to hold them overnight, stationed in the reserve trench with an outpost in the front line. The brigade had been lucky, and only suffered a handful of casualties during the day.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 137.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 448–9.Horsfall & Cave, p. 71.Middlebrook, pp. 195–7, 216–20, 236–41. On 2 July the shattered division was pulled out of the line and sent north to a quiet sector for rest and refit, though there was the usual trickle of casualties associated with trench holding and raiding.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 139–45. =Ancre= The Somme Offensive was still going on at the end of October when 31st Division returned to the sector for the Battle of the Ancre, which was to be the last big operation of the year. Serre had still not been taken, and 92 Bde was assigned to the attack alongside 3rd Division (the rest of 31st Division was still too shattered to take part). A 48-hour preliminary bombardment began on 11 November, and the brigade moved into the trenches on the night of 12/13, along communication trenches clogged with mud. Zero hour was 05.30 on 13 November, and 12th and 13th East Yorks led the way up the slope towards Serre, with 11th Bn in close support and 10th providing flank guards and carrying parties. Fog, light rain and a smokescreen reduced visibility to a few yards, and initially the two battalions had little difficulty, but 3rd Division on their right made no progress. Small-scale fighting went on all day, and Private John Cunningham of 12th Bn won a Victoria Cross (VC) for fighting on alone when all the rest of his team of bombers became casualties. A Lewis gun team from 10th Bn stopped an attack on the left flank of 12th Bn. By the end of the day both battalions had been driven back to their starting positions. The brigade suffered over 800 casualties, mostly in the two attacking battalions.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 146–66.Horsfall & Cave, pp. 77–88. The Hull Pals remained on the Ancre through the winter of 1916–17, following up the Germans when they retired to the Hindenburg Line in the Spring of 1917.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 166–78. John Nash =Oppy Wood= On 8 April 1917, 92 Bde left the Ancre and moved to the Arras sector where the Battle of Arras began the next day. After a period of training and trench-holding, the brigade moved into assembly trenches opposite Oppy during the night of 2/3 May, under shellfire. The British creeping barrage started at 03.45 and the brigade set off in four waves, in the dark and mist, into severe machine gun fire from Oppy Wood. All three attacking battalions, 10th, 11th and 12th, were held up. The officers, including 2nd Lieutenant Jack Harrison, reorganised their men for a second attempt. This too failed, but Harrison dashed on alone to try to silence the machine gun that was holding up his men. He was killed and later awarded a posthumous VC.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 178–91.Oppy Wood at Humber Museums WWI Timeline.Jackson, pp. 146–7. Oppy Wood from the air Oppy under shellfire, May 1917. Casualties in 12th Bn had been so severe that it was temporarily reduced to two composite companies attached to the 10th and 11th Bns respectively. A fresh attack on Oppy Wood was arranged for 28 June. This time the attack was to be made by 94 Bde with 92 Bde in support. 10th Battalion was the brigade reserve, two companies of 11th Bn were to hold the front line, and 13th Bn was to provide carrying parties. Before the attack, each battalion of 92 Bde supplied a detachment for a trench raid to reconnoitre the objectives (Cadorna Trench, Wood Trench and Windmill Trench). 94 Brigade made its attack in the evening of 28 June and successfully took the trenches, completing the Capture of Oppy Wood.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 191–8. 31st Division was not committed to the Third Ypres Offensive, which culminated in the dreadful Battle of Passchendaele, possibly because it was not considered to have recovered from its ordeal on the Somme a year before.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres', p. 226, in Liddle, Passchendaele in Perspective. When the BEF's brigades were reorganised on a three-battalion basis in February 1918, 12th Bn East Yorks was drafted to the 6th and 7th Bns (11th (Northern) Division and 17th (Northern) Division respectively), to 11th Bn in 92 Bde and the remainder to the 4th Entrenching Battalion. 13th Battalion was also drafted, the residue going to 4th Entrenching Bn.'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1. The two remaining Hull Pals battalions were joined in 92 Bde by the Accrington Pals (11th (Service) Bn East Lancashire Regiment) from the disbanded 94 Bde (which had absorbed the whole of 8th Bn East Lancs from 37th Division).Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 74–6.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 210–2.Jackson, pp. 169–70.East Lancashire Regiment at Long, Long Trail.37 Division at Long, Long Trail. =Ervillers and Ayette= When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 31st Division was in reserve until it was sent up on 23 March; even then 92 Bde remained in reserve at Ervillers, improving the defences. Ervillers was attacked on the evening of 24 March, the defence being confused by British troops retreating from the forward defences. There was fighting in the village streets, but the next day the combined fire of 11th East Yorks and 10th Bn Manchester Regiment of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division stopped the German advance. However, events elsewhere meant that the 31st and 42nd Divisions were ordered to retire on the morning of 27 March.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 214–23.Jackson, p. 171. The brigade defended Ayette aerodrome against repeated attacks from 11.20 to 16.30, when with both flanks 'in the air' it pulled back to the partly-dug 'Purple Line' in front of Ayette village. The last officer of 11th East Lancs to leave was 2nd Lt Basil Horsfall, who was killed during the retirement: he was awarded a posthumous VC. During the night, a composite battalion of troops from the quartermasters' details of all three battalions arrived to take over part of the Purple Line. Although fighting continued elsewhere along the line, 28 March was a quieter day for 92 Bde, which continued to dig. It was relieved on 31 March.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 223–5.Jackson, pp. 171–4. =Hazebrouck= While resting in the Monchy- Breton area the brigade received large numbers of reinforcements, mainly under the age of 19. The bombardment for the second phase of the German offensive (the Battles of the Lys) opened on 7 April, and by 11 April the brigade had been called forward in ex-London buses to form a defensive line near Estaires through which retreating British and Portuguese troops could withdraw. Next day the Germans threw in all their reserves to try to take Hazebrouck. After both flanks were again left in the air, 10th and 11th Bns were forced to retire across watercourses and hedges, pursued by the enemy, until they reached a railway embankment at Méteren and a line at Merris held by the 11th East Lancs and another composite battalion of details from five different divisions. The attack was renewed on the morning of 13 May, when the defenders caused heavy casualties among the attacking Germans. The brigade withdrew in early morning mist the following day through a new line held by fresh Australian and British troops, who defeated the attacks and ensured the safety of Hazebrouck. A temporary 92nd Composite Bn was formed from two companies from each of the battalions to assist the Australians. Before the end of the month the brigade was again taking turns in the line with the Australians, carrying out a number of raids.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 225–35.Jackson, pp. 179–86. =Le Becque= On 24 May the brigade came out of the line and began training for offensive operations. 31st Division was scheduled for Operation Borderland, a limited attack on La Becque and other fortified farms in front of the Forest of Nieppe to be carried out on 28 June, chosen because it was the anniversary of the capture of Oppy. The barrage began at 06.00 and the brigade followed it closely with all three battalions in line, in what was described as 'a model operation' for artillery cooperation. Some casualties were suffered from British shells falling short, but the German resistance was slight and the final objectives were taken by 07.25. Several hundred prisoners were captured, together with field guns and mortars. The positions were consolidated under long range machine gun fire. German troops massing for a counter-attack were dispersed by artillery fire. The brigade was relieved on 30 June.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 235–45.Blaxland, p. 149.Farndale, pp. 283–4.Jackson, pp. 188–94. Successes like La Becque showed that the tide of war was turning. After a relatively quiet period in July, during which 92 Bde achieved small advances through aggressive patrolling and seizing strongpoints (so-called 'peaceful penetration'), the Allies began a coordinated offensive in August. 92 Brigade captured Vieux-Berquin on 13 August 1918 and pushed forward until running into serious opposition at the Warnave river south of Ploegsteert on 21 August. Fighting here round Soyer Farm continued until the brigade was relieved on 12 September.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 245–56.Jackson, pp. 195–8. =Ploegsteert Wood= The brigade returned to the same trenches on 23 September, but the machine guns in Soyer Farm prevented any 'peaceful penetration'. A formal attack was arranged for the morning of 28 September (the opening day of the Fifth Battle of Ypres) but was postponed to 15.00 because of bad weather. The brigade advanced behind a creeping barrage and suffered heavy casualties, but the general retirement of the Germans along the whole line allowed it to push on through Ploegsteert Wood and advance up to the River Lys on 3 October.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 257–61.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 71–2, 82, 85.Jackson, pp. 200–2. =Pursuit= Returning to the line on 12 October, patrols from the brigade slipped across the Lys on a raft during the night of 14/15 October and established posts on the far bank. The following afternoon further parties crossed and advanced under a barrage to the Deûlémont–Warneton road. The brigade continued the advance on 16 and 17 October, liberating several villages. By 18 October the battalions were advancing in company columns screened by XV Corps cyclist battalion, leap- frogging forward to liberate Tourcoing. Pressure was kept up through 19 and 20 October, until the brigade was squeezed out of the advancing line and went into support.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 261–4.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 278, 284, 288–90.Jackson, pp. 203–4. Back in the line from 28 October, the brigade continued to advance slowly against machine gun and shell fire, from rearguards who 'did not appear disposed to give ground'. It served as divisional reserve for an attack at Tieghem on 31 October 1918 that was so successful the reserve was not required.Bilton, Hull Pals, p. 266.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 444–50. It returned to the line on the night of 6/7 November, crossing the Scheldt and sending forward 11th East Yorks as part of a pursuit force including a field artillery battery and companies from the divisional machine gun battalion, the Motor Machine Gun Corps and XIX Corps cyclists. When the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November, 11th East Lancs were leading the division, and scouts reported that there were no enemy in front.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 267–72.Jackson, pp. 205–6. Disbandment The division began to pull back on 13 November, and by the end of the month 92 Brigade was established in camp south of St-Omer and engaged in road repair. Demobilisation (chiefly of coal miners) began on 11 December and proceeded at a steadily increasing rate during January 1919. On 29 January the two East Yorks Battalions were sent by rail to Calais to deal with possible riots by men working in the Ordnance depot. Demobilisation accelerated in February and by April the battalions had been reduced to cadres, which left for England on 22 May.Bilton, Hull Pals, pp. 273–.Bilton, Hull in the Great War, p. 196. No 92nd Brigade was formed during World War II.Joslen, p. 305.

The village is located in the Central District of Botswana in Tonota subdistrict. It is approximately 8 km north west of Tonota and roughly 30 km south west of Francistown. History Mandunyane village dates back to 1973. According to the elders, the first inhabitants of Mandunyane settled at the west of the current Shashe Dam. In the early 1970s, residents were forced to relocate to make way for construction of the dam. In 1973 residents unanimously agreed to settle at the current Mandunyane. Upon their arrival there was no proper leadership. The first man to lead them was the late Kgosi Harry Mandunyane I. After his death, Kgosi Kaisara Sebopelo reigned and in 2003 Kgosi Joshua Joel inherited the throne after the untimely death of Sebopelo. There are several ethnic groups in Mandunyane: Bazezuru who reside in Maseka ward, Bakalaka, Bakhurutshe, Amandebele, Bangwato, Basarwa in Gabaratane ward and Basampesi. Bazeuru are the most populous group. Geography Mandunyane is surrounded by Tonota West to the south, Shashe Mooke to the west, Shashe Bridge to the north and Semotswane to the east. The village is divided into six wards: Moabi in the southwest, Kgari in the southeast, Gabaratane in the northwest, Maseka in the northeast, Makamane in the central north and Morokotso in the central south. The village is ideally sandwiched between Shashe Dam and the Tholodi River. Tribal administration The leadership of the village consists of the chief, headman of records, Village Development Committee, a member of parliament and a councillor. Kgosi Joshua Joel is the chief and tribal leader and is responsible for general administration of the village. He is the head of the customary court and ex- officio member of the VDC. Six headmen are the chief's principal advisors. As of 2012, they were Moabi, Mooketsi, Manake, Sehedi, Kgari and Makamane. The throne of chieftainship is inherited. The rightful heir to the throne is Joel's eldest son. The Village Development Committee, elected after every two years, is responsible for village infrastructure and social welfare. It consists of ten residents. Conah Fraiser is the chairperson of the committee as of 2012. Mandunyane falls under the Tonota South political constituency. Pono Moatlhodi is the area member of parliament. Retired Brigadier Bathoen Maseko is the village councillor. Climate Mandunyane has a semi-arid climate and most of the year offers hot days and cool nights. Average summer temperatures are 26 °C and the winters are very cold. A cool breeze flows from Shashe Dam. Rain falls from October to February. Demography In 2001 Mandunyane had a population of 3265 with 1544 males and 2121 females. In 2011, the population grew by 6% and stood at 3800. The majority of residents are the youth who make up 54% of the population. The age structure is: 54% 0–35, 30% 35–65, and 26% are 65+. Life expectancy is 54 years. The mortality rate has decreased drastically from 70% in 2000 to 20% in 2011. Religion 95% of the inhabitants of Mandunyane are Christian, 2% are Muslim and 3% follow traditional African practices. Christian denominations include Zion Christian Church, Gospel of God Church, RARA Apostolic Church In Zion, SDAC, and New Bethel. There is one mosque in Morokotso ward. Economy Mandunyane residents earn a living mostly through agriculture. Most of the residents have farms in the eastern part of the village. Output is mostly for family consumption, while the surplus is sold at Francistown. Residents also rear cattle, goats, sheep and poultry. Animals are also for family consumption and may be sold during tough times such as famine. Most youth are enrolled in government poverty eradication programmes such as Ipelegeng and backyard gardening. The poverty rate stands at 23.1%. Most of its residents, especially the youth, are employed at urban areas such as Francistown, Gaborone and Selibe Phikwe in manufacturing and industrial companies. Some are employed in government and parastatals. Education Mandunyane residents attend Mandunyane Primary School for seven years and obtain a Primary School Leaving Examinations PSLE and then graduate to Tonota Junior Secondary School for three years to acquire a JCE. Those who excel continue at Shashe River School where they obtain a BGCSE/ COSC. According to a research conducted by the ministry of education and skills development in 2010, 90% of the residents have a PSLE, 88% JCE, 45% BGCSE, and 20% have a certificate, diploma and degree while 1% have MBA, MSC and PhD. Some obtain their bachelor's degrees at the University of Botswana and other overseas universities in United Kingdom, Jamaica, United States and Canada. Entertainment Rhumba is the popular music genre in Mandunyane. Disco, traditional music and gospel are also popular. Pool and traditional chess are favourite games. Orlando, Free Corner, Step Inn and First Bar are some of the popular pubs for one to get rid of boredom at. Sojourners can also enjoy Shashe dam where there is swimming and fishing. Moagi Roca Mokgatle released a scintillating Rhumba album in 2006. Attitude is also an afro pop group from Mandunyane. Kgomotso CiCi Molalapata has also released some Motswako singles in 2013. Sports Soccer is the famous sport. An annual tournament takes place during festive season. Football clubs include Black Movers, FC Mokwakwa, Red Sparks and Zebras. Volleyball and tennis are also played. Cuisine The favourite meal is papa, morogo wa dinawa, chicken, rice, beef and chomolia. Traditional brews such as Morula, setopoti, khadi and Chibuku are also enjoyed.

His parents were Gertrude Gould and Ranald Macintosh Macdonald, and George Gould was his uncle. He attended school at French Farm on Banks Peninsula, and Christ's College in Christchurch. He was then sent to study history at Christ Church College at the University of Oxford in England, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1912, and a Master of Arts in 1919. He was a qualified lawyer but rarely practised in that profession. His education was interrupted by World War I, where he saw active service for the British Army after having been rejected by New Zealand forces due to his poor eyesight. After various assignments, he was with the Royal Tank Corps, was wounded on three occasions, and received the Military Cross in January 1919. His citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer, though wounded > shortly after zero hours, continued to supervise the carrying-up of supplies > to the battalion with which he was working, in one case reconnoitring a > village which was still occupied by the enemy. He refused to be medically > treated until his section was withdrawn.

They prefer water with ample plant cover, and occur naturally as far north as DR Congo and Tanzania. They have been introduced locally in the northern hemisphere. Younger banded tilapia feed on crustaceans and insect larvae, while the adults feed on terrestrial and aquatic plants and other debris. They undertake local migrations and may shoal before and during spawning time. They guard their own eggs, and although they may move eggs or fry in the mouth, they are not known to be actual mouthbrooders like several other tilapia species. This species can reach a length of TL and is an important foodfish. The identity of the person honoured in the specific name is uncertain but it is probably the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman (1748-1820) who was in the Cape in 1775.  Distribution  Africa: middle Congo River basin in the Kwilu, Kwango, Kasai drainage and Lomami, upper Congo River basin including the Lualaba, upper Lualaba, Lufira, Upemba region, Luvua, Lake Mweru, Luapula and Bangweulu, Cunene, Okavango, Lake Ngami, Zambezi, Limpopo, northern tributaries of the Orange River, upper Cuanza, Sabi, Lundi and Lake Malawi.  Description  Dorsal spines (total): 13 - 15. Diagnosis: A small, deep-bodied species with a narrow head and small strong jaws. Often appearing a rich deep yellow with wide dark brown bands, and red/orange fin margins; mature adults are very dark with prominent black stripes and a patch of scarlet scales behind the head. Fish can grow up to 235mm in length and the heaviest fish recorded was 445g.  Habitat  Found in widely diverse habitat, it favors areas where plant cover exists along the edges of rivers, lakes or swamps, but tends to be confined to shallow weedy areas, so it does not build up large populations in deep lakes. It is reported to be cold-confined.  Diet  Adults are omnivorous, feeding on animal and plant matter, preferentially on filamentous algae, aquatic macrophytes and vegetable matter of terrestrial origin like leaves, plants, etc.. Juveniles feed on small crustaceans and midge larvae.  Breeding  A substrate spawner. Male and female form pairs to rear the young. It undertakes seasonal upstream migration and breeds before and during these migrations  Uses  A relatively small species, so unlikely to play much of a role in capture fisheries, but cultured in ponds in Njombe, Tanzania, and apparently stocked into Lake Kiungululu, Tanzania, where it is not presently exploited. It is a forage fish for Bass. Popular angling species amongst young and inexperienced anglers, often regarded as 'gateway' species for people new to angling.

It opened in 1996 in anticipation of increased international railfreight due to the construction of the Channel Tunnel. As of 2012 the site employs over 3,000 persons, and has motorway, high capacity rail, and waterway (canal) transport access. Location and background Entrance to the facility The site is approximately northeast of Wakefield, and west of Castleford on the north side of the M62 directly west of its junction with the A655 road. It is mostly within the civil parish of Normanton, West Yorkshire, and surrounded by the townships of Altofts, Whitwood, and Normanton. Other industrial and commercial developments including the Diggerland theme park are located to the east and south. The River Calder and Aire and Calder Navigation canal form the northern boundary, the site is trisected by two parts of the Hallam Line which branches at Altofts Junction; the former North Midland Railway, and the former York and Normanton Line of the York & North Midland Railway from which the rail port branches. The site of the defunct Altofts and Whitwood railway station is within the estate.Ordnance Survey map, 2010, 1:25000 and 1:50000; also historical editions. The site in 2009 Historically the site was used for agricultural purposes until the late 19th century when coal mining began in the area (West Riding Colliery) - coal mines, and associated terraced housing (Providence Row, and Silkstone Row), a gas works, coke ovens and a dock (later staithes) on the Aire and Calder Canal were built. The site continued to be used for coal mining until closure in the 1960s, both the colliery and associated housing were cleared in the 1970s.Ordnance Survey map, 1852-4 1:10560, and 1892, 1908 1:2500 editions. In response to sanctioning of construction of the Channel Tunnel by the Channel Tunnel Act 1987, a number of schemes for rail- connected intermodal terminals and distribution centres were put forward in expectation of additional rail freight flow to be serviced; in 1989 terminals in Leeds and Doncaster were proposed. In 1990, Railfreight Distribution backed a plan to build a terminal at Wakefield instead of Leeds. Initially the terminal was planned to be south of the M62 at the former Normanton marshalling yards but was locally opposed. The alternative site included green belt land and required a public enquiry: in 1992 the development was officially sanctioned by the Secretary of State John Gummer due to its strategic importance. The development was backed by Wakefield Metropolitan District Council (underwriter), British Rail (Railfreight Distribution: operator) and AMEC subsidiary AMEC developments (developer).Sources: * * In 1996 the terminal opened, operated by Railfreight Distribution; Because of the international nature of the channel tunnel freight the terminal was operated at a higher security level than standard rail yards. The railfreight terminal occupied only of the site. By 1998 the terminal was handling 2,500 units per annum mostly swap bodies with one or less train per day operating, typically hauled in the UK by British Rail Class 47s, later replaced by newer Class 66 as introduced; the logistics park had been more successful creating 500 jobs. By 2000 over ten clients had occupied buildings including Asda and Royal Mail. In 2000 Wakefield council gave planning permission to Lafarge Redland Aggregates (part of Lafarge) for the construction of an aggregate handling wharf at the site on the Aire and Calder Canal, the wharf became operational in 2001. By 2009 the railport was working at approximately half capacity and handling one intermodal container train from Tilbury and Felixstowe per weekday and two per day from Southampton (600,000 t p.a.). The site has been identified by the Railfreight Investment Interest Group (RIIG) as one of three 'Strategic Railfreight Interchanges' (SRFI) in England (2009) together with Hams Hall and DIRFT. As of 2011 the railport is operated by EWS successor DB Schenker Rail (UK); the site as a whole employed 3,500 people., covering letter =Site description= Although the rail terminal is centrally located in the development, it lacks directly associated warehousing and is used only for intermodal transfers. As of 2009 its rail access was cleared to loading gauge W9, with an expectation of being upgraded to W10 by 2011. The rest of the development is divided into four industrial/commercial estates; Normandy Park and Rhine Park (total ) located on reclaimed colliery spoil heaps and rail yard, Valencia Park (), and Tuscany Park (). The Whitwood Industrial estate predates the Europort and is located close by.

XXX pag. 913 Origins An ancient tradition derives the lineage of Aliprandi from the great Lombard King Liutprand (712-744). Documentation of this link consists of ancient manuscripts and other sources. The derivation of the Lombard royal lineage is attested by an inscription dated 1131 in the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Monza, published by eminent historians such as Cantù and Giulini and admitted as proof of nobility for the reception in Order of Santo Stefano and Noble College of Giureconsulti in Milan. The family Aliprandi was feudal in the eponymous village, which was an independent municipality until the late 19th century, when it was annexed to the city of Lissone. In Milan, the family appears in the list of noble houses that draw from Ottone Visconti in 1277. Giovanni Aliprandi (1220) begat three sons, Arnolfo, Garibaldo and Bertarino, grandfather of Enrico, Lord of Monza. Giovannolo became the immediate vassal (with the rank of nobility, eminent) of Count Palatine and noble of the Holy Roman Empire with his brothers, his nephew and descendants of Emperor Charles IV of Holy Roman Empire on May 15, 1355.

At the time of Count Antonio Venturino the family name was changed to Fanzago. Other Branches In Verona, a branch appeared in the 15th century as heir to the name and substance of the canon and the Count Palatine Bartolomeo Cartolari. The surname of Cartolari was ascribed to the Noble Council in 1524 and still flourishes in the same city as the best-known survivors of the branches of the lineage of Aliprandi. The nobleman Giulio Cesare Aliprandi, son of Gaspare Aliprandi, brother of Luigi in 1587 received the Order of Santo Stefano', was admitted in 1584 with proof of nobility in the College of Nobles Giureconsulti of Milan. That branch of the family continues to live in Ferrara. The branch of Abruzzo became extinct in 1910. It had descended from Count Paolo di Bonifazio di Giovannolo, started in Penne by Giovanni Aliprandi. Giovanni was Treasurer of Margaret of Habsburg daughter of Emperor Charles V, had various fiefdoms including Nocciano. Giovanni Aliprandi married Valentina Visconti, the daughter of Barnabò Visconti, Lord of Milan.

Thousands flock to hear the special Holy Mass celebrated every Friday at the shrine. Apu, as the lying statue of Jesus is fondly called by devotees, has become a symbol of hope for people longing for a connection to the divine especially when all else failed. His image is supine, bruised, caught in the final act of love and sacrifice that has spelled salvation for those who believe in him. Every kiss that lands his badly bruised feet or a touch that grazes his battered hand comes with a deep conviction that through his death and resurrection, He made all things new. Apung Mamacalulu bestows mercy beyond the grave.  Origin  The tradition of venerating the image of the dead Christ traces its origin to the early Church. The earliest articles of veneration are the Sudarium of Oviedo and the Shroud of Turin, the very shroud believed to have been used in burying the body of the dead Christ. Several representations of the dead Christ became common in the fifteenth century. When Spain introduced Christianity to the Philippines, they brought several representative images of the dead Christ. Known by such names as Santo Sepulcro (Holy Sepulcher), Santo Cristo Yacente (Lying Holy Christ), Santo Retiro (Holy Retirement), Santo Entierro (Holy Burial), the most common portrayal is that of the dead Christ lying in state on a stately bier, a very popular icon in the Philippines. Fr. Bulatao, SJ, a noted author on Philippine religious psychology, writes that the Filipinos identify with the suffering of the dead Christ because of poverty and other socio-economic difficulties they experience. Angeles City has widely revered two images of Apung Mamacalulu – one at the Pisamban Maragul and the other at the shrine in Brgy. Lourdes Sur.  History  Around 1828 to 1838, Father Macario Paras, the parish priest of Angeles, ordered the image of Apung Mamacalulu to be sculpted by Buenaventura, a well-known sculptor of that day. It was first installed in a little sanctuary built by Padre Paras on his own premises, which may have also been located somewhere within Barrio Lourdes Sur (then known as Talimundoc, within the vast Paras and Dayrit estates) where it became an object of veneration among the pious inhabitants of the place. An entry in the book of records of the Roman Catholic Church of Angeles [marked as exhibit B in G.R. No. 30242] shows that the image, its carriage, and other appendages, appear to have been given as a gift to the church by Padre Paras. There is also a similar entry found in the church records under the date February 20, 1865, where it appears that the Apu image, with its adornments and carriage, was a gift from Padre Paras and was then in his care. Another document shows that the image, together with its carriage, was transferred to the church in 1872. About 1896 or 1897 during the Philippine Revolution, the image and the carriage were moved and transported to another municipality for safekeeping. Henson writes that during the tumultuous years of the revolution, the image was kept in barrio Sapangbato. It was brought back to the church sometime in 1904, where it remained to this day. The image is taken out on two occasions during procession on Good Friday and during the fiesta held in October. = The execution of Roman Payumu = Around the middle of October 1897, a band of Capampangan revolutionaries staged a raid on Bo. Talimunduc (now Brgy. Lourdes Sur). They were from the barrio of Tibo, Mabalacat, all on horseback and led by a captain. They entered the Angeles boundary through an area at the foothills of the Zambales Mountains known as Pati by the Aetas, in the Sitio of Mangga, Bo. Sapangbato. On their way to Angeles town proper, they passed the barrios of Amsic and Pampang and succeeded in recruiting young men. In the town itself, they crossed through Henson Street and fell upon Bo. Talimunduc where a group of young men voluntarily joined the Katipunero, firmly believing in the cause of Katipunan Revolution that was then converging into Pampanga from the provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. Upon learning of this Katipunan raid, the Spanish cazadores (\\"hunters\\", as the Spanish Army Infantrymen were known then) and local Macabebe guardia civil (civil guards) stationed at the casa tribunal (town hall) sprang into action and rushed to Bo. Talimunduc. There they found a number of young men dressed-up in travelling clothes, but the Spaniards were told that the Katipunan band had already fled towards Bo. Cayapa, about to the southeast. So, a platoon of cazadores and guardia civil rushed to Bo. Cayapa in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, the seven dressed-up young men were arrested and their arms tied with rope in Miquit-a-sicu fashion (tied elbows meeting at one's back), the Spanish military method of tying-up prisoners, that was guaranteed to produce intense and continuous pain at the shoulders, elbows and chest. They were then taken to the town of Baculud (now Bacolor), then the capital of Pampanga, where the provincial jail was located. They were never heard from again to this day, however, two were identified – Cornelio Manalang and Crispulo Punsalan. The platoon who rushed to Bo. Capaya in search of the rebel band found the barrio deserted, the inhabitants having fled for fear of Spanish reprisal. However, in an outlying field, they found a lone farmer tending his baritan, a small field of a special grass called barit that was sold and fed to calesa (carriage) horses. The farmer was Roman Payumu, a humble zacatero, a gatherer and provider of animal feed like grass for horses. Although illiterate and ignorant family man, he was very industrious and a good provider. He was a deeply religious man with an intense faith in God and a very devout Catholic. After selling all his barit grass to carriage drivers in the town marketplace every evening, he made it a point to pray fervently at the Holy Rosary Parish Church in Angeles town proper. When the Quinario devotion, prior to the fiesta of Apung Mamacalulu, was instituted on October 23, 1897, he quickly volunteered as a regular cargador (bearer) of the Apu during processions where he was popularly known by his nickname, Duman. Finding the barrio Capaya completely deserted, the platoon ganged-up on Duman who was brusquely interrogated regarding the Katupunero band that raided Bo. Capaya and the whereabouts of the entire barrio population. The poor Duman, knowing nothing of what transpired in his village as his field was quite far from the village, answered he knew nothing what the soldiers were talking about. Immediately, he was branded as a big liar and was quickly accused of being a Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force him to talk, but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but blood came out of his mouth, nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied his elbows in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him. At about noontime on October 25, 1897, the second day of the Quinario devotion, the Capampangan assistant priest, Fr. Vicente Lapus, was sent to Roman Payumu by the Spanish parish priest of Angeles, Most Rev. Rufino Santos, O.S.A., to hear his last confession for he was sentenced to death by firing squad that afternoon. Padre Lapus tried his best to console the condemned prisoner and succeeded in enabling him to make a last confession, and to accept his fate with complete resignation to the divine will of God. Roman was fetched by the soldiers at 2 p.m. with elbows tightly tied and was led outside. The small firing squad was composed of the Spanish cazadores lieutenant, a Spanish corporal named Cabo Moreno, and two civil guards. As a last request, Duman asked the lieutenant if he could pray to Apung Mamacalulu in the church for the last time. His request was granted and the death squad walked to the church, but all its doors were locked for the siesta (the Spanish tradition of nap time from 1 to 4 p.m.). The execution ground was behind the church, and beyond were vast sugarcane fields that stretched far up to the town of Porac. Desperate to be saved from execution, innocent as he was, ROMAN PAYUMU decided to pray near the reclining statue of Apung Mamacalulu and the closest he could get was at the last closed door of the church (facing the present Parish Hall). The Spanish lieutenant allowed Duman to kneel down outside this closed door where he tearfully implored the Apu to save him from the firing squad. In an intense and desperate outburst he cried out: The Spanish and local Macabebe soldiers broke into loud laughter seeing the kneeling Duman in a feverish frenzy of emotion. But unknown to them, Fr. Vicente Lapus was standing right behind the closed church door listening and watching everything through the small cracks. (This was how Payumu's prayer was recorded by Padre Lapus for posterity). The impatient Spanish lieutenant barked: “Puñeta! Todo esto lo que haces es ya de masiado! Levantate!” (Goddammit! This is all simply getting too much! Stand up!). Knowing no Spanish, Duman remained kneeling down and was weeping in utter hopelessness feeling abandoned to certain death by the Apu. Without warning, a local soldier grabbed his arm and forcefully pulled him up, yelling: “Puta naida mo! Ticdo na ca canu! Panaca ning alte! (Son of a bitch! Stand up now! You thunderstrucked!). Losing his balance, Duman fell to the ground. The guards pulled him up and brusquely pushed him forward to the execution spot, which was the corner church wall before reaching the present sacristy door. As the condemned man limped forward, he felt that the rope tying his elbows had become loose from the manhandling and had started to drop down! Realizing that his arms had suddenly become free, he quickly decided to run away and darted towards the sugarcane fields right behind the church (now the Holy Angel University campus). The startled executioners seemed paralyzed for a few seconds as Duman dashed away at full speed! The Spaniards were the first to react. They frantically loaded their rifles, aimed at their escaping prisoner who was just barely ten feet away and fired shot after shot! The bewildered Macabebe civil guards followed suit and started firing deadlier Caliber .43 bullets at their fellow Capampangan. Considering the tested accuracy of these then world-class rifles of hitting bulls-eye targets at a distance of 200 yards (roughly 600 feet!), it was incredible how these well- trained professional officers and soldiers could have missed their target, starting from a distance of only ten feet, and after initially firing a total of about twenty shots at their escaping prisoner! Some 100 feet inside the dense sugarcane field, Duman fell into a luctun trap, which was full of dried leaves and trash. (These were pits – 1 square meter wide and 2 meters deep where young locusts, still without wings called luctun were driven into by groups of peasants during locust infestations, and later cooked into sinigang (sour soup) or candied with muscovado sugar.) Duman hid himself at the bottom of the pit and covered his body with the trash. His right heel was bleeding from a minor bullet wound. A few minutes later, the Spaniards organized a large search party and minutely combed all the sugarcane fields behind the church and even thrust their long bayonets in all of the luctun traps they found. The searchers combed the fields up to the barrio of Siniura, Porac but failed to find ROMAN PAYUMU who, all the while, was hiding only about a hundred feet behind the church! By midnight that same evening, he secretly emerged from the pit, covered with red ants, and proceeded to hide in an outlying village where he remained up to June 1898 when the Spanish Army Forces in Pampanga were defeated by the Capampangan Revolutionary Armies of Gen. Maximino Hizon, thus liberating the entire province from Spanish rule since 1572. From all indications, the circumstances leading to the escape and salvation of Roman Payumu from certain death cannot be scientifically explained by human reason alone. Although the events were of this world and involved humans, certain inexplicable aspects appear to have mysteriously lingered within some of the events themselves that were undeniably out of this world, hence impossible to explain in physical terms. It was in these “out- worldly realms” of said events that those who knew of the mysterious salvation of Roman Payumu from certain death presented no alternative but to accept wholeheartedly Payumu's own personal but downright simple explanation to the said phenomenon: The Divine Intervention of Apung Mamacalulu! Duman returned to his old zacatero livelihood and remained an ever loyal bearer of Apung Mamacalulu till his old age and his natural death. The story of Roman Payumu's salvation from a firing squad and subsequent search became the basis of Angeles City's “Fiesta nang Apu” celebrations every last Friday of October, starting from the first Apu Fiesta on October 28, 1897. At the same time, his story spread not only in Pampanga but throughout Central Luzon and started the popular devotion to Apung Mamacalulu for millions of devotees up to the present time, many of whom truthfully attest to innumerable personal petitions and favors granted by the Apu. = The 1928 controversy = When the image was carried out in procession on Good Friday of 1928, its camarero (caretaker) Eriberto Navarro, acting for his aunt Alvara Fajardo [an heiress to the Paras estate], and with the assistance of numerous other persons [among them several policemen and then town Mayor Juan D. Nepomuceno], caused the image to be taken forcibly from the precincts of the church when the procession was over, and from there it was carried to a place that had been constructed for its deposit. Renato “Katoks” Tayag, author of The Sinners of Angeles, adds a colorful note to the 1928 incident, as recounted to him by a certain Atty. Ricardo Canlas of San Fernando: it is said that the snatching fiasco resulted not only from an ownership dispute but also from a long-standing political quarrel between the then Nacionalistas and Democratas. This incident gave rise to the 1929 replevin suit [a civil action to recover personality] G.R. No. 30242 filed on March 25, 1929, with the Supreme Court, entitled The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila vs. Alvara Fajardo and Eriberto Navarro.

It stars Sudeep, Rekha and Sudha Rani in lead roles. Naveen Mayur, Sihi Kahi Chandru, Kashi, Umashree and Vanishree feature in supporting roles. Upon theatrical release on 23 July 1999, the film opened to widespread positive response from critics and filmgoers. However, the screening had to be stopped after bandh was called for in most towns and cities and towns of Karnataka following the abduction of Rajkumar, the Kannada actor, in July 2000, thereby affecting the film's collections. After normality resumed, the film completed a 100-day run in theatres. Plot Sudeep (Sudeep) is a film actor and model. He falls in love with Suma (Rekha) during a film shoot in Ooty. They meet each other, share their views and Sudeep meets with Suma's family. Some incidents educate Sudeep that those who make mistakes they themselves correct and apologise next, when Sudeep rushing to see off his lover at the Ooty railway station, accidentally knocks an unknown young woman, Radha (Sudha Rani), into the path of a moving train. Radha does not see who knocked her over, but only catches a glimpse of the jacket he wears. The accident causes her to lose a leg, as well as the love of her fiancé. Sudeep rushes to the accident spot and takes her to the hospital. He takes care of her, but restrains from telling both Radha and Suma that he was responsible for the accident. To avoid the consequences, Sudeep offer to marry Radha. Suma is hurt by his sudden change of heart, but accepts his decision. Radha accepts his offer too, but continues to hunt for the man who knocked her over. But yet, how the truths unfold forms the rest of the story.

The director of the latter film, Sunil Kumar Desai, was roped to direct Sparsha by Sudeep's father Sarovar Sanjeev, who produced the film under the banner Sarovar Productions. Filming which began in early 2000 had to be stopped a few days into, after Sudeep fell ill from typhoid. He \\"lost weight\\" and \\"looked haggard\\" before the shooting resumed. Filming took place for a period of 99 days in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Ooty, Kushalnagar and Chikmagalur. Soundtrack Hamsalekha scored for the film and its soundtracks, also penning lyrics for the soundtrack with Shyamsundar Kulkarni, M N Vyasa Rao, Itagi Eeranna, Doddarange Gowda and R. N. Jayagopal. The album consists of eight tracks and was distributed in the market by Akash Audio. Release and response The film was released theatrically on 23 July 2000. After a run in Karnataka, it was 'specially' screened in parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Between 2001 and 2002, it was screened in various parts of the US including Cleveland, Detroit, Washington DC, Chicago, Fremont, California and Dallas. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release. M. D. Riti reviewed the film for Rediff.com and wrote, \\"Desai relies largely on music to carry this film through. But the music is, of course, of a very different genre: it is soft, melodious and full of Kannada shayari.\\" Despite rating the film well, she felt that it lacked the \\"special appeal that Desai's earlier films, Beladingala Baale and Nishkarsha had\\". She further wrote, \\"Where Sparsha seems to fall short is in the acting skills of its lead pair. Rekha comes across as rather wooden, while Sudeep certainly has the chocolate box good looks that his role calls for, but fails to deliver any powerful histrionics.\\" Adding to it, she rated the music highly before concluding writing, \\" If only the stars had had more charisma or talent, this film by Desai might have made him even better remembered than his past ventures.\\" The reviewer for Screen felt that it was a \\"touching, gripping, captivating and worth-watching film only for the last half an hour.\\" They added Desai's \\"touch of dexterity is ... missing in some places. His usual verve and agility is not found in this film.\\" They called the music \\"pleasant to the ears with three songs scored melodiously\\", editing \\"jerky\\" and that the \\"cinematography by Venu is the high point of the film\\". Performances of the leading pair, Sudeep and Rekha, were commended in that they \\"show promise\\".

In 1930, when he was only in his twenties, he began his first public works restoring historic buildings in Damascus, which was then under French colonial rule. He a member of the French reconstruction team that restored the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, the Mosque of Bosra, and the Azm Palace, the last having become a property of the French. = Eastern Mediterranean = Écochard's first solo project in the colonies was the Museum of Antioch, in which he combined ancient Syrian architectural elements with modernist design. Écochard was a firm believer in the value of historical monuments, an outlook that he maintained while working on the town plan for Damascus. His design for the town ensured protection of its many historical monuments.  Military service  He served in the Forces Françaises Libres.  Beirut  In 1943 he worked on the first master plan for Beirut. = Morocco = He served as the director of the French Protectorate in Morocco's Department of Urban Planning from 1946 to 1952. He changed Casablanca's urban plan from Henri Prost's radio-concentric system—like Paris—to a linear system, with expanded industrial zones stretching east through Aïn Sebaâ toward Fedala. There was a focus on managing the city's rapid, rural exodus-driven urbanization through the development of social housing projects.  1953 CIAM  At the 1953 Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), Michel Ecochard presented, along with Georges Candilis, the work of ATBAT-Afrique—the Africa branch of founded in 1947 by figures including Le Corbusier, Vladimir Bodiansky, and André Wogenscky. It was a study of Casablanca's bidonvilles entitled \\"Habitat for the Greatest Number.\\" It argued against doctrine, arguing that architects must consider local culture and climate in their designs. This generated great debate among modernist architects around the world and eventually provoked a schism.  GAMMA  Ecochard's collective of Modernist architects was called Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains (GAMMA), and initially included the architects George Candillis, Alexis Josic and Shadrach Woods. In the early 1950s, Écochard commissioned GAMMA to design housing that provided a \\"culturally specific living tissue\\" for laborers and migrants from the countryside. Sémiramis, (Honeycomb), and Carrières Centrales were some of the first examples of this Vernacular Modernism. This was the first time the French Protectorate built housing for the colonized rather than the colonizers, and it did so to suppress the Moroccan Nationalist Movement, particularly after the 1952 protests following the assassination of the labor unionist Farhat Hached, which were centered in the bidonville of Carrières Centrales (now Hay Mohammadi). The Moroccan GAMMA architect Elie Azagury, with whom he clashed on whether Moroccans could live in high-rises, was critical of Écochard as \\"an active instrument of the French colonial power.\\" Ecochard's 8x8 meter model, designed to address Casablanca's issues with overpopulation and rural exodus, was pioneering in the architecture of collective housing. = Lebanon = In the later 1950s, he returned to Lebanon and created urban plans for Saida (1956-1958) and Byblos (1959-1960). From 1960-1964, he conducted various studies of Lebanon. He produced a masterplan for Beirut and its suburbs in 1963/64, recognizing the need to integrate it into a regional and national strategy. = Other places = Throughout his career, Ecochard also made plans for Pakistan, Sabendé and Fria in Guinea, Martigues, Dakar, Martinique, Damascus, Tabriz, Corsica, Mashhad, Muscat, and Tehran.

The larvae live singly in tunnels in the segments beneath the cochineal cultures. If all mealy bugs have been eaten before the larva is full grown, it may extend the tunnel for some distance and complete its development as a plant feeder. The larvae are grey green or black green.

Bhaṅgṛā ( / , ) is a type of traditional dance of the Indian subcontinent, originating in Sialkot in the Majha area of Punjab. The dance was associated primarily with the spring harvest festival Baisakhi. In a typical performance, several dancers executed vigorous kicks, leaps, and bends of the body to the accompaniment of short songs called boliyan and, most significantly, to the beat of a dhol (double-headed drum). Struck with a heavy beater on one end and with a lighter stick on the other, the dhol imbued the music with a syncopated (accents on the weak beats), swinging rhythmic character that has generally remained the hallmark of any music that has come to bear the bhangra name. During harvest season Bhangra was mainly done by Punjabi farmers during the harvesting season. It was mainly performed while farmers did agricultural chores. As they did each farming activity they would perform bhangra moves on the spot. This allowed them to finish their job in a pleasurable way. After harvesting their wheat crops during the Vaisakhi season, people used to attend cultural festivals while dancing bhangra. For many years, farmers performed bhangra to showcase a sense of accomplishment and to welcome the new harvesting season.  Traditional Bhangra/folk dance of Majha  Punjabi Bhangra dancer The origins of traditional Bhangra are speculative. According to Dhillon (1998), Bhangra is related to the Punjabi dance 'bagaa', which is a martial dance of Punjab.Dhillon, Iqbal S. (1998). Folk Dances of Punjab. Delhi: National Book Shop. However, the folk dance of Majha originated in Sialkot and took root in Gujranwalla, Sheikhupur, Gujrat (districts in Pakistan) and Gurdaspur (district in Punjab, India).Ballantyne, Tony. Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World The traditional form of Bhangra danced in the villages of Sialkot district was regarded as the standard.Ballantyne, Tony (2007). Textures of the Sikh Past: New Historical Perspectives The community form of traditional Bhangra has been maintained in Gurdaspur district, India, and has been maintained by people who have settled in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India,after leaving the newly-created country of Pakistan post-partition of India.Traditional Bhangra is performed in a circle and is performed using traditional dance steps. Traditional Bhangra is now also performed on occasions other than during the harvest season. According to Ganhar (1975), Bhangra has been imported into Jammu which is danced on Baisakhi. Other Punjabi folk dances such as Giddha and Luddi have also been imported into Jammu.Harjap Singh Aujla Bhangra as an art is flourishing in India and appears to be on the verge of extinction in Pakistan Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Mohinder Singh Randhawa (1959) Farmers of India: Punjab Himachal Pradesh, Jammy & Kashmir, by M.

The first significant developers of this style were a dance troupe led by brothers from the Deepak family of Sunam (Manohar, Avtar and Gurbachan) and the dhol player Bhana Ram Sunami.Gregory D.

The singing of Punjabi folk songs, boliyan, are incorporated from Malwai Giddha. Bhangra competitions have been held in Punjab, India, for many decades, with Mohindra College in Patiala being involved in the 1950s. Bhangra today Bhangra originates from a very patriarchal society, it connects to a much more deeper set of masculine values. Most of these values are set through labour, industry and self-sufficiency in agriculture, loyalty, independence and bravery in personal, political and military endeavours; and the development and expression of virility, vigour, and honour are common themes. Bhangra referred both to formal male performances as well as to communal dancing among men and women. In the past 30 years, bhangra has been established all over the world. It has become integrated into popular Asian Culture after being mixed with hip hop, house and reggae styles of music. Certain bhangra moves have adapted and changed over time but at its core remains a sense of cultural identity and tradition.,. We see Bhangra take place mainly in the Punjabi culture, many people tend to showcase Bhangra as a source of joy and entertainment at weddings, parties, and all sorts of celebrations. Many people also do bhangra as a source of exercise, it is an excellent substitution to the gym. Traditionally, Bhangra is danced by men but now we see both men and women participating in this dance form. With Bhangra competitions all over the world, we see all sorts of people competing in these events.  Women in bhangra  Nowadays, we see many second - generation South Asian women who are connecting with their culture through bhangra.Dhurandhar, S. (2005). Return to Bhangra; From dance clubs to gym clubs, young South Asian women reclaim a dance never meant for them. Colorlines, 54. Many of these young girls tend to bring their bhangra moves into the club scene. D.J. Rekha was one of the first South Asian women to bring popularity to Bhangra in the U.S by introducing her Basement Bhangra Parties. Many university and community clubs have stated their own bhangra teams, most of these teams have a wide variety of men and women who come from different backgrounds. Many businesses have created bhangra clubs with the mindset to teach younger kids bhangra, these programs have helped young children stay healthy and connected to the culture of Bhangra. Sarina Jain, was the very first women who created the bhangra fitness workout, which is now known as the Masala Bhangra Workout. This workout has taught many people all over the world the basic steps associated with Bhangra, allowing them to learn Bhangra in the comfort of their own home. = Raaniyan Di Raunaq = Raaniyan Di Raunaq is India's first All-Women's Bhangra Competition. Even with the abundance of female Bhangra performers, many see this dance form as only masculine. Historically, women have fought for the right to perform bhangra. Many women that compete in Bhangra shows are judged according to a criterion that is made for male performers. Raaniyan Di Raunaq has customized a Bhangra competition just for women or for those who identify as transgender or non binary. This competition has coveted a safe space for women to have the ability to compete and be judged equally.

It was originally built for the Russian Navy and underwent sea trials. Subsequently, the contract was cancelled by France and agreement on compensation reached with the Russian government. Egypt and France concluded the deal to acquire the two former Russian Mistral for roughly 950 million euros. Egypt is the first and to date only country in Africa and the Middle East to possess a helicopter carrier. History The Russian government placed an order for the ship in 2011. The construction of the ship would be shared between the countries with France building about 60 percent and Russia 40. Work started in France, in Saint-Nazaire, on 1 February 2012 and in the Russian Baltiysky Zavod shipyard in St. Petersburg in October 2012. Russia would send its parts to France for final assembly. The ship was expected to join the Russian Navy in 2015. The ship was launched on 15 October 2013. The ship began its first sea trials on 5 March 2014. Savings in construction costs were anticipated, due to the use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts, rather than requiring every system to be designed to military standards. The Russian acquisition of French Mistral- class amphibious assault ships was considered to be the largest defense deal between Russia and the West since World War II. The 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine triggered rising international criticism. France was under political pressure from other nations to sanction Russia by cancelling or suspending delivery of the two Mistral-class vessels. On 3 September 2014, French President François Hollande released an announcement that France was suspending the delivery of Vladivostok to Russia due to the ongoing War in Donbass, Ukraine. By 13 September 2014, a partial ceasefire was in place in Ukraine. This improvement in conditions in Ukraine was sufficient for French authorities to allow Vladivostok to go to sea for her acceptance trials. French Defence Ministry sources said a decision on the delivery of Vladivostok would be taken by mid-November. On 25 November, it was announced that delivery of the two ships was to be postponed indefinitely. Russia threatened legal action over the postponement. In August 2015 the two governments reached agreement on terms for cancelling the contract; France would keep the ships and fully reimburse Russia. On 7 August 2015, a French diplomatic source confirmed that President Hollande discussed the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi during his visit to Egypt during the inauguration of the New Suez Canal in Ismailia. Subsequently, Egypt and France concluded the deal to acquire the two former Russian Mistral for roughly 950 million euros, including the costs of training Egyptian crews. Speaking on RMC Radio, Jean- Yves Le Drian, French Defence Minister, said that Egypt had already paid the whole price for the helicopter carriers. On 2 June 2016, DCNS delivered the first of two helicopter carriers acquired by the Arab Republic of Egypt in October 2015, the Landing Helicopter Dock Gamal Abdel Nasser. The flag transfer ceremony took place in the presence of Egyptian and French Navies’ Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Rabie and Admiral Rogel, Hervé Guillou, chairman and chief executive officer of DCNS, Laurent Castaing, chairman and chief executive officer of STX France, and senior Egyptian and French officials. Before sailing to Alexandria, the helicopter carrier Gamal Abdel Nasser participated in a joint exercise between the Egyptian and French Navies. On 16 September 2016, DCNS delivered the second of two helicopter carriers, the Landing Helicopter Dock Anwar El Sadat which also participated in a joint exercise with the French Navy before arriving at its home port of Alexandria. Aircraft Ka-52K Katran, the ship-based attack helicopter is likely to serve on Egypt's Mistral carriers. Since receiving its two Mistral-class carriers, Egypt had issued an international tender for the procurement of new maritime helicopters. The Egyptian Navy and Air Force studied several offers for helicopters to use on both carriers. European and Russian manufacturers entered the bidding procedure; NHIndustries and Airbus Helicopters were reported to have offered their NH90 and Tiger helicopters, while Russian Helicopters offered its Ka-52K helicopter. By May 2017, the tender had reached its final stage, Russian Helicopters stated that it would immediately enter into pricing negotiations if the company won the tender. In June 2017, Russia announced it had won the tender to provide Ka-52K helicopters for the Egyptian Mistral carriers. The head of the FSVTS, Dmitry Shugayev, said that pre- contract work was underway, including final agreement on the helicopter's technical concept and other financial conditions. Egypt is likely to buy the same package intended for the Russian Navy, which includes Ka-52K attack helicopters and Ka-29/31 utility helicopters, before the contract was cancelled by France.. Military exercises =Cleopatra 2016= In June 2016, Gamal Abdel Nasser took part in military exercises jointly conducted by the Egyptian and French navies in the Mediterranean Sea. The drills were held under the code name Cleopatra 2016 and lasted for several days, they were the first for the ship after being delivered to Egypt earlier that month. The exercises included a number of activities such as both forces planning and managing naval combat missions.

It is a linkage of prime importance for Northeastern India. Sections The 804 km (500 mi) long trunk line, been treated in more detail in smaller sections: # Barauni- Katihar, Saharsa and Purnia sections # Katihar-New Jalpaiguri, Thakurganj and Siliguri sections # New Jalpaiguri-New Bongaigaon section # New Bongaigaon- Guwahati section History =Pre-independence era= The earliest railway tracks in Assam were laid in the Dibrugarh area in 1882 for the transportation of tea and coal. The first passenger railway was also in that area. Linking Guwahati was the challenge. In response to the demands of tea planters in Assam for a rail link to Chittagong port, the Assam Bengal Railway started construction of a railway track on the eastern side of Bengal in 1891. A track between Chittagong and Comilla was opened to traffic in 1895. The Comilla–Akhaura–Kulaura–Badarpur section was opened in 1896–1898 and finally extended to Lumding in 1903. The Assam Bengal Railway constructed a branch line to Guwahati, connecting the city to the eastern line in 1900. During the period 1884–1889, Assam Behar State Railway linked Parbatipur, now in Bangladesh, with Katihar in Bihar. North Bengal State Railway had opened a metre gauge line from Parbatipur and the line subsequently got extended beyond the Teesta, and through Geetaldaha to Golokganj in Assam. During the 1900–1910 period, the Eastern Bengal Railway built the Golakganj–Amingaon branch line, thus connecting the western bank of the Brahmaputra to Bihar and the rest of India. Katihar got linked to Barauni around the turn of the century. =Assam Link project= With the partition of India railways in Assam got delinked from those in the rest of India. Indian Railway took up the Assam Link project in 1948 to build a rail link between Fakiragram and Kishanganj. Fakiragram was connected to the Indian railway system in 1950 through the Indian portion of North Bengal with a metre gauge track. The New Jalpaiguri–New Bongaigaon section was partly new construction, partly old line converted to broad gauge in 1966. Broad gauge reached Guwahati in 1984. Bridges The construction of the long Rajendra Setu in 1959 provided the first opportunity to link the railway tracks on the north and south banks of the Ganges. The long rail-cum- road bridge located at Munger 55 km downstream of the Rajendra Setu, links Jamalpur station on the Sahibganj Loop line of Eastern Railway to the Barauni–Katihar section of East Central Railway. The long Farakka Barrage carries a rail-cum-road bridge across the Ganges. The rail bridge was thrown open to the public in 1971, thereby linking Kolkata with North Bengal and Assam. The construction of the long Saraighat Bridge, the first rail-cum-road bridge across the Brahmaputra, was an event of great excitement. Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister formally laid the foundation stone on 10 January 1960 and it was completed in 1962, connecting the two parts of the metre gauge railways in Assam. Electrification Electrification of the long Barauni–Katihar–Guwahati section was sanctioned in 2008. As of January 2020 , Katihar New Jalpaiguri section has been electrified , and 4 pairs of electric passenger trains are going up to NJP .

He is chiefly remembered for founding the village of New Birmingham in County Tipperary, for his ill-advised purchase of the island of Lundy, and for his entertaining diary. He was a colourful character, noted for his heavy drinking and gambling, but also for his intellectual interests, and his stern criticism of his own class. Family He was the son of Vere Hunt of Curragh Chase, County Limerick and Glengoole, County Tipperary, by his second wife, Anne Browne, daughter of Edmund Browne of New Grove. His father was the eldest son of the Reverend Vere Hunt (died 1759), and his wife Constantia Piers, granddaughter of Sir Henry Piers, 1st Baronet. He was a descendant of the Earls of Oxford through Jane de Vere, a granddaughter of the 15th Earl, who married Henry Hunt in 1572.John Burke, A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire (Volume 1, H. Colburn, 1833), 351. His own son changed the family name to de Vere. Sir Vere's great-great grandfather, yet another Vere Hunt, was an army officer who served with Oliver Cromwell and who settled in Ireland in 1657.Limerick City Archives Reference IE LA P22 The Hunt/de Vere family estate, which they owned for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the de Vere Baronetcy of Curragh, is the present day Curraghchase Forest Park, in County Limerick. Hunt was created a baronet, in the Baronetage of Ireland, in 1784 and was appointed High Sheriff of County Limerick the same year.John Burke, A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire (Volume 1, H. Colburn, 1833), 351. Hunt raised and commanded three regiments of foot during the French Revolutionary Wars, including the 135th (Limerick) Regiment of Foot. He was a member of the Irish House of Commons for Askeaton from 1798 to 1800.leighrayment.com Irish House of Commons 1692–1800 He married Hon. Eleanor Pery, daughter of William Pery, 1st Baron Glentworth and his first wife Jane Walcott: they had one son, Sir Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Baronet. The marriage is said to have been unhappy, although he always referred to his wife with respect. They mostly lived apart.Lenox-Conyngham, Melosina Diaries of Ireland Lilliput Press Dublin 1998 p.128 She died in 1821. He was the grandfather of the poet and critic Aubrey Thomas de Vere and the politician and social commentator Sir Stephen de Vere, 4th Baronet. Career Against his political inclinations, he voted for the Act of Union 1800, apparently in the hope of recouping the enormous expenses (estimated at £5000) which he had incurred as an MP (the Crown was shameless about bribing politicians to vote in favour of the Union).Lenox-Conyngham p.128 He was never a good man of business, as shown by his unwise purchase in 1802 of the island of Lundy, which attracted him because the owner was not liable to pay taxes. Here he settled an Irish colony, with its own constitution, laws, and coinage. However the colonists were unable to make a profit, due to agricultural problems, and the venture cost him so much money that he spent years pleading with the British Crown to take it off his hands; it was only many years only after his death that his son was able to dispose of it.Lenox-Conyngham pp.128-9 Lundy Island, which Sir Vere purchased in 1802, an act he quickly regretted. He was also a very heavy gambler, and his debts became so large that he was forced to spend much of 1803 in the Fleet Prison, despite his claims that the Crown owed him large sums of money.Lenox-Conyngham pp.128-9 On the other hand he was a good landlord, who was always anxious to improve the condition of his tenants. He opened a coal mine at Glengoole, County Tipperary, and for the benefit of the miners he founded the village of New Birmingham, near Thurles, with the help of the local priest Fr. Meighan (who was a personal friend, despite Hunt's general suspicion of Catholic priests).Lenox-Conyngham p.128 He obtained a charter to hold regular markets and fairs in the village.Lewis, Samuel Topographical Dictionary of Ireland 1837 He evidently hoped to turn New Birmingham into a major manufacturing centre, but failed in this aim, as in many of his other business ventures, although the village itself survived.Lewis Topographical Dictionary Personality His entertaining diary, of which several extracts have been published, shows him as an eccentric character with a great ability to enjoy of life, especially the pleasures of good food and drink, music and theatre. The diary gives a valuable glimpse of social life in the Dublin of the early nineteenth century, with its fashionable taverns, eating houses and theatres. He managed a touring theatrical company, and founded at least one newspaper.Limerick City Archives He had some of the normal tastes and prejudices of his class- for example, he was addicted to duelling, fighting his first duel at the age of eighteen. He was in general hostile to Catholic priests, although he was a strong supporter of Catholic Emancipation, and numbered some priests among his friends, notably Fr Meighan of Glengoole. In other respects however he has been described as a \\"maverick\\", hostile to his own class, the Anglo-Irish elite, which was centered on Dublin Castle, \\"this fallen and degraded sham-court\\", as Hunt described it. On 4 June 1813 he was at an official reception at Dublin Castle which he described in scathing terms as being attended by \\"pimps, parasites, hangers-on....spies, informers...alas poor Ireland\\".Lenox-Conyngham p.133 References Category:1761 births Category:1818 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland Category:Irish MPs 1798–1800 Category:High Sheriffs of County Limerick Category:De Vere family Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Limerick constituencies ","title":"Vere Hunt"},{"id":"34577169","text":"Cactobrosis insignatella is a species of snout moth in the genus Cactobrosis.

The concept is commonly depicted as fan art of normally non-erotic subjects engaging in sexual behavior. Origin Rule 34 may have originated from a 2003 webcomic, captioned \\"Rule #34 There is porn of it. No exceptions.\\", which was drawn by Peter Morley-Souter to depict his shock at seeing Calvin and Hobbes parody porn.; Popularization Internet users have made Rule 34 into a prevalent meme, owing to the ubiquity of internet pornography, especially among genres such as fan fiction, slash fiction and hentai. In May 2007, a Rule 34 database was launched on Paheal.net with a searchable archive of Rule 34 images, and similar sites began appearing soon after.; On August 20 that year, the webcomic xkcd published a comic titled \\"Rule 34\\", which involved hypothetical sexual scenarios including homoerotic spelling bees. In 2008, users of the imageboard 4chan posted numerous sexually explicit parodies and cartoons illustrating Rule 34.

A 2013 CNN story said Rule 34 was \\"likely the most famous\\" internet rule that has become part of mainstream culture.Todd Leopold, Meet the Rules of the Internet, CNN, February 15, 2013. On November 14, 2018, a twitch streamer celebrated turning eighteen by posting a video to Twitter in which he looked up Rule 34 pictures. The popular video and its responses were covered by The Daily Dot. According to researchers Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam, \\"Today, Rule 34 thrives as sacred lore on blogs, YouTube videos, Twitter feeds and social networking sites. It's frequently used as a verb, as in 'I Rule 34'ed Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell on the judging table'.\\" They propose the reason why the maxim resonated with so many people is because it \\"certainly seems true\\" for \\"anybody who has spent time surfing the Web\\".Ogi and Gaddam, 2011. Cory Doctorow concludes, \\"Rule 34 can be thought of as a kind of indictment of the Web as a cesspit of freaks, geeks, and weirdos, but seen through the lens of cosmopolitanism, [which] bespeaks a certain sophistication—a gourmet approach to life.\\" Variations The original rule was rephrased and reiterated as it went viral on the Web.

The initiative was spearheaded by Prime Minister Peter O'Neill as part of his well-publicised anti-corruption drive. The mandate of Task Force Sweep was initially to investigate allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, but the scope was expanded to include investigating allegations of corruption in a number of other government departments and their officials. Task Force Sweep is currently chaired by Sam Koim, the Principal Legal Officer at the Department of Justice and Attorney-General. The investigations are led by the Police Department's Fraud and Anti-Corruption Unit and Finance Intelligence Unit (FIU). The team is composed of senior members of the Police Force, Public Prosecutor's Office, Internal Revenue Commission, the Ombudsman Commission, the Auditor General's Office, the Justice Department, Treasury and Provincial and Local Level Government. Due to its composition, Task Force Sweep has the power to investigate, prosecute and recover the proceeds of crime. Investigations The primary matter for investigation by Task Force Sweep was with respect to monies appropriated through the Development Budget from 2009 to 2011, and in particular the PGK125 million intended for the Kokopo Community Projects and a PGK10 million sum that was disbursed to Kokopo businessman Eremas Wartoto. In October 2012, Sam Koim concluded that almost half of PNG's PGK7.6 billion development budget for the period 2009 to 2011, had been lost through corruption, misappropriation and mismanagement. According to Koim, \\"We have uncovered a lot of instances where there was no recourse to budget and people were spending money left, right and centre, squandering funds and using them for private purposes\\". The Task Force created a watch list of 33 prominent individuals and has asked the national airline Air Niugini to monitor the movements of these individuals. Since the creation of this list in September 2011, a number of individuals named on it have been arrested, including the politician Paul Tiensten and former Acting Secretary of the Department of National Planning, Ruby Zarriga. According to a statement issued by Koim in November 2012, Task Force Sweep has registered 174 complaints about corruption, since its inception. Of these, 52 cases have been investigated. =Arrests= Task Force Sweep has made 40 arrests since it was established in 2011: * In August 2011, businessman Eremas Wartoto became the first person to be arrested by Task Force Sweep, in relation to the misappropriation of PGK7 million of public funds, designated for an education project. Jeffery Yakopyia, a former assistance secretary in the economic division of National Planning and Monitoring Department has also been arrested in connection with the investigation into Wartoto. * Ruby Zarriga was arrested in September 2011 on allegations of conspiracy to defraud the State and misappropriation of public funds, relating to a PGK10 million payment to businessman Eremas Wartoto. * Former MP Alois Kingsley was arrested in September 2011 for receiving PGK6.6 million from the Kokopo Infrastructure Fund. He is reportedly in Kokopo jail, where he has been denied bail. * In early November 2011, Francis Ank, treasurer for the Komo-Margarima district, was arrested by the task force and charged with the theft of PGK2 million. Subsequently, he was separately charged with 21 counts of misappropriating PGK300,000 from the district. * Paul Tiensten was arrested in November 2011 following allegations of misappropriation of funds, conspiracy to defraud the state and abuse of office. It was alleged that Tiensten authorised a PGK10 million payment of air subsidies to Travel Air, of which Tiensten holds a stake. * Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Francis Potape was arrested in November 2011 on allegations of misappropriating public funds amounting to PGK60,000; * In December 2011, businessman David Kumalau Pondros was arrested by Task Force Sweep for the misappropriation of PGK400,000 belonging to the Oro provincial government. Pondros was previously arrested in October 2011 for misappropriating over PGK6 million from the National Planning Department. The case is pending in court. * On 17 January 2012, Australian businessman and Sarakolok West Transport (SWT) General Manager, Timothy Rowland, was arrested by Task Force Sweep. SWT is alleged to have tried to extort US$4.5 million from the Manus provincial government through the sale of a boat that had already been paid for by the National Planning Department. * Zebedee Jabri Kalup, the head of Zenalis Waterfalls Ltd and the executive officer to the Madang MP, Buka Malai, was arrested by Task Force Sweep on 23 January 2012 for allegedly misappropriating PGK4.25 million from the Department of National Planning and Monitoring. The charges stemmed from Kalup's alleged misappropriation of PGK2.5 million, which had been granted by the Department of National Planning and Monitoring for the rehabilitation of Sitepra Cocoa Estate, but was paid into the private business account of Zenalis Waterfalls Ltd. Kalup has been charged by Task Force Sweep with six counts of misappropriation and false pretence, but has been released on a PGK600,000 bail. * In early September 2012, Sam Koim announced that Task Force Sweep had made four further arrests. This included the arrests of Tracey Tiran, a director of Sits-Up Services Ltd; Daniel Peter Yaro, the General Manager of Yurr Construction Limited; and Tumbi Yari, the Acting District Administrator of Komo-Magarima District. Each were arrested and charged with the misappropriation of public funds allocated by the Department of National Planning and Monitoring. * In late September 2012, Task Force Sweep issued a warrant for the arrest of Jeffrey Nape, the former Speaker of Parliament, for the alleged misuse of PGK5 million of funds intended for the rehabilitation education sector infrastructure program for schools in Sinasina-Yongumugl. Nape was arrested by police and taken to Port Moresby, where he was detained for questioning. * Anton Kulit, the former Secretary for the Department of Commerce and Industry was arrested by Task Force Sweep in September 2012 and charged with misappropriation and conspiracy to defraud the government of a grant worth PGK3 million intended for piggery and poultry projects in East New Britain Province. * Australian businessman, Leonard Patrick Capon was arrested by Task Force Sweep in November 2012 and charged with the misappropriation of public funds. The Department of National Planning and Monitoring had paid Capon's company, Rural Development Services Ltd, PGK1.5 million for the development of a new mini-hydroelectric power project in Hela Province in PNG's Southern Highlands. However, the project was never completed and the funds were allegedly diverted. * On 20 December 2012, Peter Tokunai, the owner of Islands Energy Limited was arrested by Task Force Sweep and charged with misappropriation. Tokunai is alleged to have received PGK1.5 million from the Department of National Planning and Monitoring in 2011 for the reconstruction of the St Joseph Catholic Church in Malaguna 2, Rabaul. However, the project was never completed and it is alleged that Tokunai diverted the funds for his own personal use. =Current Investigations= Task Force Sweep is currently investigating allegations against former Prime Minister Michael Somare and his wife, Lady Veronica Somare, of misappropriation of public funds. The allegations relate to payments of PGK3.7 million paid to public and non-public officials during the hospitalisation of Somare. Many arrests are expected in the course of this investigation, including Somare's daughter Bertha and his personal assistant Seke Ua Karingal. Somare's brother, Paul, is also believed to have been involved, along with Richard Gogo, Constable John Keai and Rodney Kamus, Somare's personal aide. In December 2011, Sam Koim announced that Task Force Sweep had uncovered a number of \\"syndicates\\" in PNG that had colluded to misappropriate large sums of public funds, which had been channelled out of the country. Sam Koim referred to Australia as \\"another Cayman Islands\\" for allowing perpetrators to launder their proceeds of crime. At the end of 2011, Task Force Sweep was given additional funds of US$1.4 million to expand the scope of their work. They are reportedly due to investigate the Taiwan diplomatic scandal, which saw a naturalised Singaporean citizen jailed in Taiwan for his part in a cash-for-diplomacy scandal in November 2011. Wu Shih- tsa reportedly embezzled US$30 million worth of diplomatic funds in an exchange with the PNG government who was hoping to forge diplomatic ties with the government of Taiwan. Criticisms of Task Force Sweep In January 2012, former Prime Minister Michael Somare criticised Task Force Sweep for being a tool for officials to exercise political vendettas. In October 2011, Paul Tiensten, the former National Planning Minister applied for a Judicial Review of the decision of the National Executive Council (NEC) to establish Task Force Sweep in order to investigate allegations of corruptions at the National Planning and Monitoring Department. Tiensten’s application was rejected, with costs by the NEC. Conclusion of Investigation Sam Koim submitted Task Force Sweep's final investigation report to Prime Minister Peter O'Neill in May 2012, on the completion of Task Force Sweep's investigation into corruption and mismanagement in the public sector. The report stated that the level of corruption in Papua New Guinea had \\"migrated from a sporadic to a systematic and now an institutionalised form of corruption\\", describing Papua New Guinea as a \\"mobtocracy\\". According to Task Force Sweep, PGK52 million has been recovered, and hopes to recover almost double that figure by the end of 2012. The report states that the balance will come from PNG Central Bank freezing PGK55 million in National Capital Ltd's bank accounts, (the issuing agent for PGK125 million of Treasury Bills for the development of projects in Kokopo which was never authorised) to be paid back to the state. Koim said 20 politicians will be referred to the ombudsman commission for further investigation, 24 public servants had been suspended for \\"facilitating or benefiting from corruption\\" and 10 lawyers will be referred to the PNG law society for investigation. In addition, a warrant has been prepared for Jeffery Nape, Speaker of the National Parliament, although has not been served.

The practice of conserving an unstable painting on panel by transferring it from its original decayed, worm-eaten, cracked, or distorted wood support to canvas or a new panel has been practised since the 18th century. It has now been largely superseded by improved methods of wood conservation.Dardes and Rothe p.189 The practice evolved in Naples and Cremona in 1711–25 and reached France by the middle of the 18th century.Dardes and Rothe pp. 268–269 It was especially widely practiced in the second half of the 19th century. Similar techniques are used to transfer frescos. Oil paintings on canvas often receive additional support or are transferred to a new backing. Methods The process is described by Henry Mogford in his Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures. Smooth sheets of paper were pasted over the painted surface of the panel, and a layer of muslin over that. The panel was then fixed, face down, to a table, and the wood planed away from the back until it was \\"as thin as a plane may safely go\\", and the remainder scraped off with a sharp instrument such as a razor. The ground of the painting was then removed by solvents or scraping, until nothing remained but a thin skin of colour, pasted over with paper and held together by the muslin. A prepared canvas was then attached to the back of the paint layer, using the same method as was used for lining pictures. When the glue had dried, the paper and muslin were removed by careful damping. The leading workshop carrying out the process in Paris in the eighteenth century was that of Jean-Louis Hacquin (d. 1783), who transferred many works in the French royal collection. Transfers from the workshop have sometimes been found to have a layer of pieces of silk, or of sheets of paper between the paint layer and the new canvas. The workshop was continued after Hacquin’s death by his son, François-Toussaint Hacquin (1756–1832), who transferred many paintings taken to France from Italy during the Napoleonic period. Another method, used by Hacquin's contemporary, Jean- Michel Picault, dissolved the ground layer chemically, apparently with fumes of nitrous oxide, allowing the panel to be removed intact from the paint. A later restorer, Marie-Jacob Godefroid is recorded as having achieved similar results by the use of steam. A less dramatic \\"partial transfer\\" tended to be used in Germany and Austria, in which a thin layer of the original wood was retained, and glued onto a new panel.Dardes and Rothe p.222  References  =Sources= * =Citations= Category:Conservation and restoration of paintings Category:Painting materials ","title":"Transfer of panel paintings"},{"id":"34577280","text":"The Ninth of November 1888 by William Logsdail, Guildhall Gallery, London William Logsdail (25 May 1859 – 3 September 1944) was a prolific English landscape, portrait, and genre painter. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists, the Grosvenor Gallery, the New Gallery (London), and others.Wood, Christopher. Dictionary of British Art, Volume IV: Victorian Painters: I. The Text, (Antique Collectors' Club, Woodbridge, 1995), p. 321 He is notable for his realistic London and Venice scenes and his plein air style. Early life He was born in the Close of Lincoln Cathedral, in Lincoln, England, May 1859. He was one of seven children, six boys and one girl. His father was a verger at the cathedral.Cooper, Francis J.. William Logsdail of Lincoln (1859-1944): Memorial Exhibition, 1952, (Usher Art Gallery, 1952), p. 5 As a boy, William attended Lincoln School (now Lincoln Christ's Hospital School), and also earned money by guiding visitors up the central tower of the cathedral. Training Logsdail attended the Lincoln School of Art, where he initially showed an aptitude for architecture, but with the encouragement of his art master, Edward R. Taylor, (who was also Head of the School) he took to painting. While there, he won the Gold Medal for his work in competition with students at other English art schools.Cooper, Francis J.. William Logsdail of Lincoln (1859-1944): Memorial Exhibition, 1952, (Usher Art Gallery, 1952), p. 6 He went on to study in Antwerp, at the École des Beaux-Arts, under Charles Verlat.'A Celebrated Lincoln Artist', Lincoln Gazette, June, 1883 While there, he became the first Englishman to win first prize at the School.'Art at Antwerp', The Times, 7 April 1879, p. 11Cooper, Francis J.. William Logsdail of Lincoln (1859-1944): Memorial Exhibition, 1952, (Usher Art Gallery, 1952), p. 7 One of his works from this period, The Fish Market (1880), was bought on behalf of Queen Victoria for Osborne House., When told of this, Logsdail supposedly commented, 'Shows her Majesty's good sense'. Career In the autumn of 1880, Logsdail visited Venice where he was to remain, with occasional visits to England, the Balkans, Egypt and the Middle East, until 1900. During this early period in his career, he gravitated towards architectural and subject paintings. His The Piazza of St. Mark's, Venice, painted in 1883, was judged by the Royal Academy to be the 'picture of the year' when it was exhibited in LondonGrieve, Alastair. Whistler's Venice, (Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2000), p. 173 although he appears to have been dissatisfied by it, and seriously considered cutting the painting up during its composition. He also painted some sixty-nine small paintings for the Fine Art Society on the subject of the French and Italian Riviera. Seven of these were sold to the Duke of Westminster. In 1893, Logsdail was awarded a medal for oil painting at the World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago World's Fair).'British Art Awards at Chicago', The Times, 19 August 1893, p. 5 After spending two years in Taormina and Sicily, he and his family returned to England, settling in West Kensington, London, where his The Early Victorian (1906) (a costume portrait of his daughter Mary) was well received. This marked the beginning of a period of portrait painting for Logsdail, who was offered so many commissions that he was able to pick and choose his sitter at will. In 1912, he was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. As his career progressed, he turned to flower studies. Personal life and death William Logsdail Oxfordshire Blue Plaque, Noke, Oxfordshire In 1892, Logsdail met May Ashman of Necton, near Swaffham in Norfolk, marrying her in the same year. He had three children with her In 1922, he and his family moved to the Manor House at Noke, near Islip, Oxfordshire, where Logsdail remained until his death at the age 85. A plaque on the house commemorates his time there. Relations with other painters Logsdail was a friend of Frank Bramley, who also attended Lincoln School of Art and went on to co-found the Newlyn School and be elected to the Royal Academy. While Logsdail was still studying, the art critic John Ruskin saw his painting of Lincoln Cathedral's south porch and expressed a favourable opinion of the work, later writing to him and suggesting that he go to Verona once his studies had reached a conclusion, advice the young artist ignored. While in Venice, Logsdail moved in a social circle that included Harper Pennington, Robert Frederick Blum, Martin Rico y Ortega, Frank Duveneck, James McNeill Whistler and John Singer Sargent,Pennell, E. R., & J.. The Life of James McNeill Whistler, (1911), p. 190 the latter of whom inscribed a picture to Logsdail.Ormond, Richard. John Singer Sargent: Paintings, drawings, watercolours, (Phaidon Press Ltd, London, 1970), page 29 While not inclined to openly criticise other artists, Logsdail did, in his memoirs, relate a story concerning Walter Sickert. As he worked on his Ponte della Paglia (1898), Sickert arrived and set up his easel nearby. He then 'began to caper like a master of fence, backing and lunging with sudden stabs at his canvas'. An American passing by noticed a button on the pavement, retrieved it and, offering it to Sickert, said, 'Excuse me, sir, but I think this has worked loose!'.Cooper, Francis J.. William Logsdail of Lincoln (1859-1944): Memorial Exhibition, 1952, (Usher Art Gallery, 1952), p. 9 Style St. Martin's-in- the-Fields Logsdail cultivated a tight objective and realistic style, although his later portraiture and the works painted while in Sicily demonstrate a relaxation of this style. His Venice-based works exhibit a high degree of draughtsmanship described as beautiful and nearly photographic.Sanders, John. 'Visualising Lincoln, The Work of Peter de Wint', pp. 58-71, in, Walker, Andrew, (ed.). Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History, (Wharncliffe Books, Barnsley, 2001, p. 58) There is a cool proficiency in his architectural work and street scenes that express what was actually there before him. For example, in the winter in which he came to paint his St. Martin's-in-the-Fields (1888), he hoped for a snow scene, but when faced with only rain and sleet, Logsdail, with his feet buried in straw to keep them warm, painted the scene without snow.Cooper, Francis J.. William Logsdail of Lincoln (1859-1944): Memorial Exhibition, 1952, (Usher Art Gallery, 1952), p. 8 Contemporary criticism The Times, in its review of the Royal Academy's 1881 exhibition, called Logsdail's work technically almost faultless, resembling a first-rate mosaic, rather than possessing those qualities understood by artists as painting and lacking 'delicacy of gradation'.'The Royal Academy', The Times, 24 May 1881, p. 5 The Standard, in their review of the Royal Academy's 1883 exhibition described his The Piazza of St. Mark's, Venice as possessing a 'vivacity of characterisation' and a 'brilliancy of painting'.'The Exhibition of the Royal Academy', The Standard, 7 May 1883, p. 3 In its review of London art exhibitions in 1887, The Times commented that his 'eastern' works, such as Arch of the Khalif - Cairo and Doorway of a Mosque, painted while in Egypt, were admirable and suited his talents as a colourist.'Art Exhibitions', The Times, 31 October 1887, p. 8 Commenting on his The Ninth of November (The Lord Mayor's Procession, London, 1888) (1890), the Birmingham Daily Post pointed out its success in its accurate portrayal of the 'vigour, variety, humour, and incident of a London crowd'.'Royal Society of Artists, Autumn Exhibition', Birmingham Daily Post, 30 August 1892 The Morning Post, in its review of the Royal Academy's 1897 exhibition, highlighted the 'sincerity' and 'judicious combination' of colour hues demonstrated in his Bronze Horses of St. Mark's, Venice (1897).'The Royal Academy, Concluding Notice', The Morning Post, 5 June 1897, p. 4 Posthumous sales The record auction price is for a picture of The Bank and the Royal Exchange which made £420,000 at Duke's auctions.

He lives and works in Estoril, Portugal, and teaches at the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Lisbon. Botelho was born in Lisbon, Portugal. He studied architecture at the Lisbon School of Fine Arts from 1968–76, and painting at the Byam Shaw School of Art (1983–85) and the Slade School of Fine Art (1985–87), London. In 2005 he held a retrospective exhibition at the Modern Art Centre, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon. Artistic practice Botelho's work has always been concerned with the socio-political realm, and his 1969 collages focused on the May 1968 Paris uprisings and the Vietnam War. From 1970 to 1983 he was mainly involved in architecture, with his art practice remaining marginal and intermittent. After moving to London in 1983 – where he kept a studio until 1996 – his work became more allegorical and more concerned with questions of personal and collective identity, and his interest in the unveiling of the unconscious was closely linked to his fascination for Goya: \\"His poetics and iconography spring from the adolescent revelation of Goya's Black Paintings [...] at the Prado Museum.\\"PINHARANDA, João – World Life and Self-Portraits [2005]. In: BOTELHO, Manuel – Manuel Botelho: Desenho e Pintura, 1984–2004. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2005, p. 9. His early 1980s works were often closely linked to his own life, speaking of loss or separation. Simultaneously, he searched for his roots in the past, and he found himself reflecting on how the present seemed haunted by the memories of 41 years of oppression (Salazar and Caetano's dictatorship – 1933–1974): \\"We sense it is not Botelho' personal nightmare, but a collective one; the subject he is taking on is the ruinous fabric of a whole society.\\"HYMAN, Timothy. In: BOTELHO, Manuel – Manuel Botelho: Pintura e Desenho 84/86. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1986, p. 5. At the Byam Shaw School of Art Botelho \\"created a new vision of oppression with a cast of archetypal characters, led by the figure of the Priest/Bishop/Dictator\\", and by the time he arrived at the Slade, he \\"was discovering a genuine iconography – a world of donkeys and hovels, of peasants working the fields with primitive tools, of crumbling stone – built walls – a pre-industrial past that stands as a metaphor for modern Portugal\\".HYMAN, Timothy. In: BOTELHO, Manuel – Manuel Botelho: Pintura e Desenho 84/86. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1986, p. 9. This dark vision slowly eased off, and the \\"themes of aggression and domination [gave] way to a more intimate and personal iconography\\"; the formal quest, the structuring of the picture plane and the push and pull of pictorial space became top priorities as he revisited Picasso's synthetic cubism in paintings where \\"eroticism, or the more generalized sensuality of the relationship between mother and child\\"ROSENGARTEN, Ruth. In: BOTELHO, Manuel – Manuel Botelho. London: Flowers East, 1992, p. 4. became main themes. As he distanced himself from cubism, his drawing became more subtle and sensitive, and a dynamic sense of movement liberated his figures from gravity and immobility. By the late 1990s his multi-layered representations alluded to a wide range of subject matter, from present-day life to traditional religious themes, \\"bridging the gap between sacred and profane, contemporary temporality and timelessness\\".PINHARANDA, João – Book of Errors (2000). In BOTELHO, Manuel – Manuel Botelho: Painting and Drawing. Lisbon: Estar Editora Lda., 2000, p. 116. In 2006 he \\"resorted to a new medium, photography, to build a body of work that nevertheless reflects the main characteristics of his practice: examination of historical issues, references to the Western pictorial tradition, and figuration as a stylistic signature\\".AMADO, Miguel – Manuel Botelho (2008), Artforum Online. For his long-term project Confidential/Declassified, on the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–74), he spent 15 months at the Lisbon Military Museum taking photographs that depict the weaponry of both the Portuguese and the African forces, from improvised single-shot firearms to the G3 and AK-47 rifles. And in subsequent series he reinstated a type of narrative that relates to his earlier painting, \\"using elements drawn from a concrete war [...] to deal with that particular war, as well as all other wars; and also [...] war as an abstract reality\\".PINHARANDA, João – Manuel Botelho's Secret Reports (2008). In: BOTELHO, Manuel – Confidential/Declassified II: Combat Rations. Lisbon: Fundação EDP, 2008.

His 2011–12 works include large-scale 3D pieces made with campaign tent cloths and the sound installation \\"Letters of Love and Longing\\", based on the letters exchanged between a soldier in Portuguese Guinea and his girlfriend in Lisbon: \\"sounding like a radio soap opera [...] the text locates us in time and in space, showing us the dimension of feelings: Portugal and Guinea, nineteen-sixties and Colonial War, love and death, jealousy and hope\\".PINHARANDA, João – Tell me what it was like… [2011].

The tramway was unusual for having a track gauge of only . Network and fleet The City of Oxford and District Tramway Company was incorporated under the Oxford Tramways Order (1879) in accordance with the Tramways Act 1870. Its initial capital was £42,000 raised by an issue of £10 shares. The first route linked Oxford railway station and Oxford Rewley Road railway station with Cowley Road via Queen Street, Carfax and High Street. Its eastern terminus was at the junction with Magdalen Street. Major General Charles Scrope Hutchinson from the Board of Trade inspected it on 28 November 1881. It opened to the public on 1 December 1881. On 28 January 1882 a second route was opened from Carfax to Rackham Lane via Cornmarket Street, Magdalen Street, St Giles Street and Banbury Road. On 15 July 1884 a third route was opened to Kingston Road via Beaumont Street and Walton Street. On 15 March 1887 a route was opened from Carfax to Lake Street, New Hinksey via St Aldate's and Abingdon Road. On 5 November 1898 the Banbury Road route was extended to Summertown, terminating at the junction with South Parade. By 1895 the company had a fleet of 16 single-deck trams. By 1910 its fleet was 19 double-deck trams and it had 150 horses. Its depot and stables were off Leopold Street at . Most of the network was single track with passing loops. The network had no fixed tram stops: drivers and conductors were ordered to look out for likely passengers. Trams were timetabled to run every 15 to 30 minutes. In its latter years the network carried some three million passengers a year, mostly for one penny fares. The network had a speed limit of . The branch to Kingston Road had tight curves at the road junctions at either end of Beaumont Street. Here there was occasionally a derailment, with a tram colliding with either the Taylor Institution building or railings outside Worcester College. A horse bus network developed to serve those parts of Oxford that lacked tramways. In the tramways' latter years, horse buses operated a route along Iffley Road from Iffley Turn to Broad Street and a route from Wolvercote along Woodstock Road to Carfax. On Saturdays only there was a horse bus service from Cowley village to connect with trams at their Magdalen Road terminus. Later there was a Saturday-only horse bus service from Headington to Carfax. Electrification proposal The Tramways Act 1870, Section 43, provided for private companies to build and operate tramways on a 21-year concession. As the Oxford company opened its first line in 1881 this concession ended in 1902. Oxford Corporation had the option to either buy out and take over the tramway or renew the concession. A meeting in Oxford in May 1902 considered proposals for the corporation both to take over the tramways and to electrify them via a conduit in the road surface. But political consensus was not achieved, and the corporation made a new agreement that the company would extend the network and continue operation until 1907. In 1905 the Corporation changed its mind and decided both to take over the tramway and have it electrified. In September 1905 it reached agreement with the company to take over its assets and operations from 31 December 1906. On 6 December 1906 a new City of Oxford Electric Traction Company was incorporated to this end. It was a subsidiary of the National Electric Construction Company. Parliament debated the Oxford Tramways Bill 1906 and then passed the Oxford and District Tramways Act 1907 granting powers to rebuild and electrify the network, double track much of its track, extend its existing routes and build five new routes. Proponents now favoured the electrification by the ground- level stud contact system instead of the conduit system. There was a strong recommendation that the rebuilding should include widening the track gauge from 4 feet to the standard gauge of . Electrification was opposed by Oxford academics and others. No overhead wires were proposed, but objectors said they objected to overhead electric wires in High Street. The commercial photographer Henry Taunt opposed the bill not only because he disliked overhead wires, but also because he alleged that the Corporation had recently overspent on other large projects, and hence that buying and electrifying the tramway would burden Oxford's ratepayers. The rebuilding, electrification and network expansion scheme was defeated. Proponents tried to revive it in 1909 and 1911, but without success. Statutory powers under the 1907 parliamentary act lapsed in 1912. Closure and legacy The company suffered a strike by its tram workers in 1913. William Morris and Frank Gray started a motor bus service in direct competition with the tram and without a licence. The tramway company responded by replacing its trams with motor buses. The last horse trams ran in 1914. In 1921 the company was renamed The City of Oxford Motor Services. No Oxford tram survives intact. Oxford Bus Museum at Long Hanborough preserves parts of three of the company's double-deck trams dating from 1882, 1887 and 1898, in unrestored condition. The poet John Betjeman (1906–84), who was a Magdalen College undergraduate 1925–28, refers to the tramway in his poem On an old-fashioned water-colour of Oxford, published in 1959: > But we will mount the horse-tram's upper deck... > Bound for the Banbury Road in time for tea. Oxford Bus Company bus in Butterwyke Place in 2008 in the livery of the former tramway In 2006 Oxford Bus Company commemorated the tramways' 125th anniversary by painting one of its single-deck buses in the tram company's maroon and cream livery.

It commanded four battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers in the Home Defence role. It was broken up in November 1916 as its battalions were posted away. History =Origin= In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line units. Similarly, by 1915 most 2nd Line infantry battalions were formed into 2nd Line brigades and divisions with the same title and composition as the pre-war 1st Line formations. 188th (2/1st Northumberland) Brigade was organised in January 1915 from 2nd Line Territorial Force (TF) units of the Northumberland Fusiliers, and formed part of 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division.

Christians began to see the secularization of the celebration day of the birth of Christ as the shift toward Santa Claus and gift exchanging replaced the celebration of the advent of Christ and giving to the poor and needy without expectation of receiving anything in return. The poem A Visit from St. Nicholas (1822) helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance. Harriet Beecher Stowe criticizes the commercialization in her story \\"Christmas; or, the Good Fairy\\".Stephen Nissenbaum, The battle for Christmas, Vintage Books, 1997, p. 134. An early expression of this sentiment using the phrase of \\"the true meaning\\" is found in The American magazine, vol. 28 (1889): :\\"to give up one's very self – to think only of others – how to bring the greatest happiness to others – that is the true meaning of Christmas.\\" The phrase is especially associated with Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843), in which an old miser named Ebeneezer Scrooge is taught the true meaning of Christmas by three ghostly visitors who review his past and foretell his future. The topic was taken up by satirists such as Stan Freberg and Tom Lehrer during the 1950s and eventually by the influential TV special A Charlie Brown Christmas, first aired in 1965 and repeated every year since. \\"That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown,\\" says Linus van Pelt, referring to the birth of Christ. Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957) also illustrates the topic, and was very influential in the form of an animated TV special produced in 1966. The phrase and the associated moral became used as a trope in numerous Christmas films since the 1960s. The phrase found its way into the 2003 Urbi et Orbi address of Pope John Paul II, \\"The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand down in time the true meaning of Christmas!\\"Urbi et Orbi message of His Holiness Pope John Paul II Christmas 2003U (vatican.va).

The goals of the event are to cherish the Latin language and cultural heritage as well as to inspire youth to continue working with Latin. \\"Athenis Finlandiae\\" translates to \\"in the Athens of Finland\\". The city of Jyväskylä received this epithet in the 1850s when the Finnish national poet, Elias Lönnrot, once wrote a letter to another Finland- minded writer, Wolmar Styrbjörn Schildt, saying: \\"You Schildt, over there in Jyväskylä, the Athens of Finland, the cradle of the arts and sciences...\\" Schildt, living in Jyväskylä at that time, had just developed the Finnish terms for the words \\"science\\" and \\"arts\\". Later, this humorous reference to Athens started to become reality, as the first schools and pedagogical institutions where Finnish was the language of teaching, were established in Jyväskylä. Today, Jyväskylä is particularly well known for its university and other educational institutions, as well as its lively and fresh cultural scene. Since 2008, the city has hosted the annual Athenis Finlandiae event, the concept of which lies in the classical culture and languages. The event is arranged by the MuKuTa association.

Overview The Green Light Trust has been working in environmental and social change for 20 years. They have a long-term relationship with remote rainforest dwellers in Papua New Guinea. The aim of their work both there and in the UK is to empower individuals, communities and businesses to make informed choices. Golden Wood, Lawshall - with The Foundry and its wind turbine in the background. The mission of the Trust is to bring communities and landscapes to life through 'hands-on' learning and the growing of woodlands. With independence and self-sufficiency as the goal, they work with both urban and rural communities to find land, design, plant, manage and own their woodland projects. The Trust also provide education for sustainable development through local action and global citizenship. Their work in schools involves pupils from early years to the sixth form; from gathering seeds to caring for woods in order to help them develop as wise caretakers of the earth’s resources. They are based in their headquarters in Lawshall at the Foundry, a carbon neutral building. The Trust have nearly 60 rural and urban community-owned woodland projects in 8 counties throughout the East of England Region with others in Yorkshire, Kent and London. Around 70 hectares of land are now under community management and they have over 1000 committed volunteers with over 3000 children engaged in continual school programmes. The organisation began in 1993. Their overall goal now is to build a unique patchwork of rejuvenated landscapes and communities, to initiate 200 projects and impact on 100,000 children. Main aims Green Light Trust Logo * Enhancing children's environmental education * Strengthening local communities * Helping achieve results in business through resource management * Conserving our natural heritage for the future. Activities * Training opportunities for children, businesses, and local communities. * Conserving the natural heritage for the future through innovative Community-owned WildSpace programmes. * Provision of an award- winning venue for hire. * Assisting companies develop corporate social responsibility initiatives. * Providing resource management training for business and helping them with sustainability. Community and cohesion A Hauswin (traditional rainforest Wind House) - built at Golden Wood, Lawshall, with the assistance of five Hunstein Rangers from Papua New Guinea The Trust believe that by building strong connections between local people, schools, businesses and nature, a lasting difference can be made to the environment and people's attitudes to nature. Planting and managing a community wild space brings local people together, and the recreational area they create generates a feeling of pride and ownership amongst the community. The planting of Wild spaces by the community can generate lasting benefits including: * a strong, close-knit community * unique educational opportunities for local children * an increase in wildlife and biodiversity in the area * global awareness and international friendships. =Forest for Our Children = Forest for Our Children was the Trust's first Community-owned WildSpace project. It has been the inspiration behind their many other WildSpace sites around the UK and their environmental education programmes for schools. Based near the Trust's headquarters in Lawshall, Forest for Our Children is 9 hectares of land made up of 2 woods in the parish. Crooked Wood was planted in 1993 and Golden Wood between 1994 and 2010. =Community-owned WildSpace Scheme= Green Light Trust's Community-owned WildSpace Scheme was started in 2001 with a unique funding partnership from B&Q;, Forestry Commission and Suffolk County Council. Over the last 10 years the Scheme has been a tremendous success. Working in partnership with local communities, Green Light has helped to establish nearly 60 rural and urban projects in 8 counties (including 2 business WildSpaces in Oxford and Cambridge. Through the Trust's environmentally led approach, the Community-owned WildSpace Scheme has directly empowered at least 30,000 individuals in 58 communities to enhance, enjoy and value their local environment; and encouraged social responsibility by enabling individuals and organisations to get involved in social action on their doorsteps. Many uncommon and endangered species now colonise the woodlands and wild spaces that have been created. Children and education Children are at the heart of our work at the Green Light Trust who believe educating children about the environment, and helping teachers inspire a love of nature within them, is an essential step in tackling environmental issues. The Trust run a number of school programmes for children and courses for adults working in education, with 3 clear aims: * Environmental education for all * Engaging and interactive learning experiences * Lifelong bonds between people and nature The Trust promote forest schools, a highly successful Scandinavian education programme promoting woodland-based classrooms which give children the opportunity to learn outdoors and explore the environment. The Foundry - venue for meetings. The Foundry The Foundry is the Green Light Trust's headquarters and training centre which is set in 2.5 acres of meadowland at Bury Road, Lawshall. In 2006, The Foundry was awarded a prestigious RIBA Sustainability Award. Built using \\"deep green\\" construction methods, it is a carbon neutral building that is as autonomous as possible. The Foundry was originally an 1840s threshing barn that was transformed into a traction engine maintenance shed in the 1880s. It later became a forge and foundry between 1920 and 1950. Abandoned for 50 years, Green Light Trust decided to breathe new life into it and to make The Foundry their headquarters as well as a shining example of sustainable building in East Anglia. The project started on 27 May 2005 and a year later the self-sufficient and carbon-neutral building was completed. The building is available for hire.

He was installed as the king in 1960, making him one of the longest reigning monarchs in Nigeria. His father was Prince Rufai Adeto and mother, Alhaja Ajibabi Adetona (née Onashile). As king, he represents the Anikilaya ruling family. Young Prince Adetona, variously attended Baptist School, Ereko, Ijeu Ode; Ogbere United Primary School, Oke Agbo, Ijebu Igbo; and Ansar-Ud-Deen School, Ijebu Ode between 1943 and 1950. For his secondary education, he attended Olu-Iwa (now Adeola Odutola) College, Ijebu Ode from 1951 to 1956. Between 1957 and 1958 he took up an appointment with the then Audit Department of the Western Region, Ibadan. The prince resigned his appointment in 1958 to pursue further studies in accountancy in the United Kingdom, which was the colonial ruler of Nigeria at the time. By a letter dated January 4, 1960, referenced CB. 4 1/333, the Permanent Secretary in the Western Region Ministry of Local Government conveyed to the Local Government Adviser in Ijebu Ode approval of the Western Region Governor in Council, the appointment of Prince Sikiru Kayode Adetona as king, and his confirmation as the new Awujale of Ijebuland with effect from that date (January 4, 1960). It became the lot of Ijebu notables like the late Ogbeni- Oja, Chief (Dr.) Timothy Adeola Odutola, Bobasuwa I, Chief Emmanuel Okusanya Okunowo (MBE, KFNM); and Asiwaju, Chief Samuel Olatubosun Shonibare to arrange for the home-coming of the King-elect. On January 18, 1960, the Head of the Ijebu Ode Regency Council, the Ogbeni-Oja, Chief Timothy Adeola Odutola formally presented the new traditional ruler to the whole world. This presentation, which was a novelty, signalled the commencement of the installation ceremonies of the king-elect. It was indeed, a new dawn in the annals of Ijebu people. The king-elect thereafter proceeded to undergo the traditional seclusion at the Odo for three months. Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, who had earlier been nominated along with five others by the ODIS was unanimously selected by the kingmakers in conformity with Section 11 of the Chiefs Law of 1957 applicable in Western Region. The then Governor signed the Instrument of Office approving Prince Sikiru Kayode Adetona as Awujale of Ijebuland. The formal coronation took place on Saturday, April 2, 1960. On Tuesday, April 5, 1960 newly crowned Oba Adetona, took his seat as a member of the Western Region House of Chiefs, after a formal introduction. Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona was a charismatic Prince, and some Obas and Chiefs nominated him for the presidency of the House of Chiefs. Albeit, an older and traditionally more senior Oba, late Sir Adesoji Aderemi, Ooni of Ife was subsequently elected the President. The thought here was that early as a monarch, the twenty-six-year-old Awujale was a fit and proper king for the exalted position. No doubt, this consideration was an admission of the uniqueness of the Awujale of Ijebuland.

Description In the chronological sequence of Bruegel's work, this painting of 1564 marks an important departure as the first to be composed almost exclusively of large figures. The group of people, taken from Italian mannerist painters like Parmigianino, permits Bruegel to concentrate on individual faces, giving each a quite distinct, and sometimes grotesque, expression.* Jean Gossart, The Adoration of the Kings, Lorne Campbell, from 'The Sixteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings with French Paintings before 1600', London 2011; published online 2011 This emphasis on the uniqueness of each figure, and Bruegel's lack of interest in depicting ideal beauty in the Italian manner, makes it clear that although borrowing an Italian compositional scheme, Bruegel is putting it to quite a different use. In this treatment, the painter's first purpose is to record the range and intensity of individual reactions to the sacred event.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, Skira, Milano 2003.

The cocoon is spun within the larval cavity and possesses a long neck extending to the trapdoor, which is pushed open by the emerging adult.

First World War The brigade, originally the 2/1st Lancashire Fusiliers Brigade, was created in late August 1914 during the early stages of the First World War as a duplicate formation of the Lancashire Fusiliers Brigade and was part of the 2nd East Lancashire Division, the division itself formed as a duplicate of East Lancashire Division. The brigade, composed of four 2nd Line battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers, was formed from those comparatively few men already serving in the Territorial Force before the war who originally had wished not to serve overseas as, according to the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, soldiers of the TF were not obliged to serve overseas without their consent. The brigade was intended to act as a reserve for the 1st Line units serving overseas, to send drafts of replacements for battle casualties. Poelcappelle in 1917. Throughout 1915 all divisions of the Territorial Force were given numbers and so, in August 1915, the 2nd East Lancashire Division was numbered as the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division and the brigades were also numbered, the 2/1st Lancashire Fusiliers Brigade being numbered as the 197th (2/1st Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade. In early 1916, conscription was introduced and the Military Service Act 1916, which swept aside the distinction between 'Home Service' men and those volunteering for foreign service and, as a result, the brigade and division began training for eventual service overseas. On 11 February 1917 the 197th Brigade, together with the rest of the 66th Division, received orders to prepare for a move overseas to France and left two weeks later, arriving by 16 March. They were destined to serve with the rest of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in the trenches of the Western Front and ended up seeing its first battle during Operation Hush and later the Battle of Poelcappelle, part of the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres). Due to a manpower shortage in the BEF serving on the Western Front in early 1918, all British divisions in France and Belgium were reduced from twelve to nine infantry battalions, and so, as a result, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers was disbanded and the men posted to other battalions of the regiment. In March 1918, together with the rest of 66th Division, the brigade suffered extremely high casualties during Operation Michael, the opening phase of the German Army's Spring Offensive. Such were the heavy casualties received by the brigade that it was reduced to a cadre and became a training brigade and saw no more active service for the rest of the war. The brigade was replaced in the 66th Division by the 1st South African Brigade. The war came to an end on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice and, in 1919, the brigade was disbanded. =Order of battle= The 197th Brigade was constituted as follows during the First World War: * 2/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (left 18 April 1915) * 2/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (became 6th Battalion 20 February 1918, left 22 July 1918) * 2/7th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (left 30 June 1918) * 2/8th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (disbanded 31 July 1918) * 3/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (from April 1915, disbanded 13 February 1918) * 202nd Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (moved to 66th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 11 March 1918) * 197th Trench Mortar Battery * 6th (Service) Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers (from 21 July 1918, left 19 August 1918) * 9th (Service) Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (from 21 July 1918, left to become Divisional pioneer battalion 22 September 1918) * 18th (Service) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (from 8 August until 19 September 1918) Second World War After the First World War, both the brigade and division were disbanded, along with the rest of the Territorial Force. However, in the 1920s, the Territorial Army was formed, on a similar basis to the Territorial Force. By March 1939 another war in Europe seemed inevitable and so the Territorial Army was ordered to be doubled in size. The brigade came into existence again, now designated as the 197th Infantry Brigade, and again became part of the 66th Infantry Division, which was also again reconstituted as a duplicate of 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, and the brigade was again formed as a duplicate of 125th Infantry Brigade. The brigade was not, however, formed as an exact duplicate of the 125th Brigade and consisted of only two battalions (whereas the 125th had three)Joslen, p. 310. of the Lancashire Fusiliers and one of the East Lancashire Regiment.Joslen, p. 361. The Second World War began on 3 September 1939, and the brigade and 66th Division were immediately mobilised. As it was in the Great War, the brigade was originally part of the 66th Division until it was broken up in June 1940, shortly after the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated at Dunkirk. With the disbandment of 66th Division, the 197th Brigade (with 257th Field Company, RE and 110th Field Regiment, RA under command) was transferred to the 59th (Staffordshire) Motorised Division, nicknamed \\"The Pithead Division\\", and reforming it as a standard infantry division, having previously been a motorised division of only two brigades.Joslen, p. 93.

In June 1942 the brigade, along with the rest of the 59th Division, was transferred to Northern Ireland, where they came under command of British Troops Northern Ireland and began training alongside the troops of the United States Army (who had entered the war in December 1941) stationed there in numerous large-scale military exercises. Later in the year the brigade was slightly reorganised with the addition of the 1/7th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment which arrived from 143rd Brigade to replace the 2/6th Lancashire Fusiliers, which transferred to the 211th Brigade. The battalion had already seen active service over two years before in France and Dunkirk, one of few units in the 59th Division to do so. In March 1943 the brigade returned to the mainland again, and soon found itself in Kent. After spending many years training in the United Kingdom the 197th Brigade, together with the rest of the 59th Division, landed in France on 29 June 1944, D-Day + 23. The division, under command of XII Corps, became part of the British Second Army, which was engaged in the Battle for Caen. With the arrival of the 59th Division General Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, decided to renew the offensive to capture the city of Caen, which was originally a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division which ultimately failed, due mainly to heavier resistance than expected. Operation Charnwood. The brigade's first action was Operation Charnwood with 2/6th South Staffords (of 177th Brigade), along with C Company of the 7th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (the divisional MG Battalion), together with numerous units of the Royal Artillery under command (and 510 Field Company, RE), and supported by the Churchill tanks of the 1st East Riding Yeomanry (of 27th Armoured Brigade). The brigade suffered comparatively light casualties in Charnwood. The 197th Brigade later fought in the Second Battle of the Odon, and the Battle of the Falaise Gap. In late August 1944, however, both the brigade and division were broken up. This was due to a combination of heavy casualties being suffered in all British divisions in Normandy and a severe shortage of infantrymen throughout the British Army and the men of the brigade were sent as replacements to other British divisions in the 21st Army Group, either individually or with their platoons or companies (for example, two whole companies of the 1/7th Royal Warwicks were sent to the 2nd Battalion of 185th Brigade, British 3rd Division). =Order of battle= 197th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the Second World War: * 2/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers * 2/6th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (left 4 October 1942) * 5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (from 3 September 1939) * 197th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 13 July, disbanded 31 December 1940) * 1/7th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment (from 4 October 1942) =Commanders= The following officers commanded 197th Brigade during the war: * Brigadier S.T.

It was established in 1944 and saw service as a medium bomber squadron in Italy during the Second World War. After the war, the squadron was disbanded and was resurrected in 1980 as a medium transport helicopter squadron - a role it retained until it was finally disbanded in 1991.  History  30 Squadron was originally constituted as No. 223 Squadron RAF and was established when 223 Squadron was re-designated as 30 Squadron SAAF at Pescara in Italy on 12 August 1944. While designated as No. 223 Squadron RAF, the unit had been based in Kenya from 1935 flying Gordons, Vincents and Wellesleys in a peacetime role. At the outbreak of war, it was deployed in support of the East African campaign until April 1941 when the squadron was transferred to Egypt as a training unit for converting crews to Blenheims, Marylands, Bostons and Baltimores. It resumed operations as a bomber unit in May and was then moved to Libya after the battle of El Alamein, then to Tunisia in April 1943, and to Malta in July 1943. By the end of September, 223 Squadron was operating as part of 3 Wing SAAF from southern Italy in an interdiction role until its transfer to the SAAF in July 1944, operating B26 Marauders. Once converted to 30 Squadron SAAF, the unit was placed under command of 3 Wing SAAF. The new SAAF squadron flew its Martin Marauders from the original RAF base at Pescara and moved to Jesi in October 1944, concentrating on raids against communications and railway links in Yugoslavia and Northern Italy. Operations continued until 15 October when the Squadron was withdrawn from action for one month, resuming operations on 22 November 1944. The last operational flight occurred during April 1945 and the squadron was withdrawn from operations on 3 May 1945. After the end of hostilities in Italy, the squadron was used in a transport role, being transferred to Biferno in June 1945 and was disbanded on 15 July 1945. The squadron was re-established on 8 December 1980 at AFB Ysterplaat when 'A' Flight of 15 Squadron, flying Super Frelon and Puma helicopters was re-designated as 30 Squadron. It was also assigned two civilian SA 330J Puma's owned by the Department of Environmental Affairs for Antarctic support missions. In January 1986 all Super Frelon helicopters were transferred to 15 Squadron and the Squadron continued flying Pumas until 31 December 1991 when these aircraft were transferred to 22 Squadron and 30 Squadron was disbanded for the last time.

In a career that lasted from April 1802 to April 1803 he ran four times and won two races. In the summer of 1802 he won the Derby on his second racecourse appearance, but the rest of his form was moderate and he was not considered the best of his generation. Background Tyrant was a bay horse bred by his owner Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton. Tyrant was the third of three Derby winners sired by the unusually named Potoooooooo, a highly successful racehorse who became an important and influential sire. Tyrant was the second of a record seven Derby winners trained by Robert Robson at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was the fifth of fifteen foals produced by Sea-Fowl, a mare also known as Miss Brighton. The best of Sea-Fowl's other offspring was probably Trafalgar, who was beaten by a head by Paris in the 1806 Derby. Racing career =1802: three-year-old season= Tyrant made his first racecourse appearance at Newmarket on 20 April 1802. He started at odds of 5/2 in a field of four runners over the Rowley Mile course and won from Sir Charles Bunbury's filly Julia, the odds-on favourite. At Epsom on 3 June Tyrant started at odds of 7/1 for the Derby in a field on nine runners. Ridden by Frank Buckle, he was restrained in the early stages as the lead was contested by Mr Wilson's unnamed Young Eclipse colt (the 11/8 favourite) and Sir Charles Bunbury's Orlando. As the two leaders weakened in the straight, Buckle produced Tyrant to take the lead and win the 1,500 guinea prize. Pierce Egan attributed the victory to Buckle's tactical skills and described Tyrant as \\"one of the worst horses that ever won a Derby.\\" After a break of four months, Tyrant reappeared at Newmarket in autumn. On 6 October he ran a subscription race over the two- mile \\"Ditch In\\" course. He started favourite at odds of 5/6 but finished fourth of the five runners behind Julia, Duxbury and Gulliver. =1803: four- year-old season= Tyrant began his four-year-old campaign at Newmarket on 12 April when he ran in a 200 guinea Sweepstakes. Running over the Ditch In course he finished third behind Orlando and Mr Wilson's still unnamed Young Eclipse colt in a race which reversed the Derby form. At the next Newmarket meeting the Duke of Grafton paid a forfeit when Tyrant failed to appear for a match against Mr Howard's colt Creeper over the Ditch In course. Stud career Tyrant does not appear to have had a career at stud. His name does not appear on any lists of stallions and he has no recorded progeny in the General Stud Book.

Chilean decree 1914 In order to avoid first world war battles in the Strait of Magellan, on 15 December 1914 Chile declared that the internal waters of the Strait of Magellan as well as the channels around should be considered as Territorial or Neutral Sea, even where they extend more than three miles from shore (the usual definition).Michel A. Morris, The Strait of Magellan, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers In 1914, a German merchant was inspected by a British warship and on 14 March a Norwegian ship was seized by a British warship. Argentina protested the Chilean decree on March 8, 1915 but didn't specify any reason to do so. The Snipe Incident In 1958, the Argentine navy shelled a Chilean lighthouse in the (at the time) uninhabited Snipe islet and occupied the island. A severing of ties took place between the nations took place as a result, with ambassadors being recalled from both nations. The Chilean Navy was sent to the zone and the Argentine Marines were pulled back from the island. It is considered the most serious incident to take place in the zone. Ballenita Incident In July 1967, the master of Panamanian ship Ballenita was fined in Chile after it took as passenger an Argentine pilot for the trip to Ushuaia. Because of this, Chilean pilots now have to board ships bound for the Beagle Channel in Montevideo instead of Buenos Aires. Cruz del Sur Incident The lucrative centolla fishery around Tierra del Fuego led to an incident in August 1967 when the Argentine schooner ' was found fishing from Gable Island and had to be ordered by a Chilean Patrol Boat ' to retrieve her nets and leave the zone escorted out of Chilean waters. Few days later the ship re-appeared in the company of an Argentine patrol craft. Protests from both sides were issued at the highest diplomatic level. Quidora Incident On 29 November 1967 the Chilean Patrol Boat Quidora (PTF-82) was shelled by the Argentine Navy from Ushuaia. The USCGC Southwind affair On 3 February 1968 the USCGC Southwind in emergency conditions headed to Ushuaia via the eastern entrance of the Beagle Channel without notification nor permission of the Chilean Government. The Chileans protested. The Barnevelt incident On 21 May 1977, after the arbitral award, the Argentine Navy installed a lighthouse in the (inhabited) Barnevelt Island. It was immediately dismantled by the Chilean Navy.Renato Valenzuela Ugarte and Fernando García Toso in A treinta años de la crisis del Beagle, Magazine Politica y Estrategia, nr 111, 2008, page 37 On the east mouth of the Magellan Strait On 8 June 1978 Chile sent a diplomatic objection to Argentine activities off the eastern mouth of the Magellan Strait and reserving rights there. In September 1980 an offshore oil rig authorized by Argentina was warned by a Chilean warship and then by military helicopter to abandon the area. Also an Argentine military aircraft threatened a Chilean warship proceeding toward the Strait of Magellan from the Falkland Islands. ARA Gurruchaga incident On February 19, 1982, six weeks before the beginning of the Falklands War, an incident occurred that could have sparked a full-fledged war between Chile and Argentina during the Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict. An Argentine patrol boat, the ARA Gurruchaga (Ex-USS Luiseno (ATF-156)) was anchored at Deceit Island inside the Beagle zone under mediation in Vatican, ostensibly providing support for sports boats participating in the Rio de Janeiro-Sydney boat race. The Quidora torpedo Boat approached and ordered the Argentine ship to leave the area. She fired several warning shots when the Argentine craft refused to move, as other Chilean ships converged to the scene. Although originally ordered not to leave the area and to wait for Argentine warships to arrive, the Argentine patrol boat received new orders to proceed to port as it became obvious that the Chilean navy had no intentions of backing down.

She ascribes her interest in union activity to her family’s history, saying “I will never forget what life was like as a working mother of four without the protection of a union.” In 1991 after organizing her fellow co-workers to join the union, she became an official member of SEIU District 1199. The following year, she started as a union organizer. In addition to being the first woman president of SEIU District 1199, she is also the only District 1199 president who has worked her way up from union member to president. In 2008, Williams was elected to serve as President of District 1199. In addition, ten newly elected officers were also sworn in at this time. As president, Williams used her political influence to encourage the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009. She was criticized for this by Rush Limbaugh, who called her a “union thug.” In 2010, Williams and the union promoted the \\"Skip A Space\\" campaign, opposing the re-election of Democratic congressman Zack Space, who had voted against the PPACA.

In 1993, he won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his magazine Tell coverage of Sani Abacha's military rule. Early career After graduating with distinction from the Ghana Institute of Journalism, Igiebor began his career at the Nigerian Television Authority in Edo State, where his last position was as senior news editor. His next employer was the National Concord Group, where he was news editor. He left there to become deputy editor-in-chief for the Nigerian news magazine Newswatch. In 1991, Igiebor co-founded the independent news magazine Tell and became its editor-in-chief. Like Igiebor, most of Tell's journalists came to the magazine from Newswatch, after its editor Dele Giwa was killed by a letter bomb and its editorial policies became consequently less daring. Tell published articles critical of the government and military, causing the magazine's relationship with military ruler Ibrahim Babangida to become increasingly strained. In April 1993, when the magazine featured an interview with retired General Olusegun Obasanjo as its cover story, the government confiscated 50,000 copies of Tell and the staff was forced to go into hiding. They continued to publish as a tabloid, however, becoming \\"the first of Nigeria’s Guerrilla tabloids of contemporary times\\". Tell in the Abacha era On 12 June 1993, Babangida annulled the results of the nation's presidential election after opposition candidate Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola was victorious. General Sani Abacha then seized power in a coup as Nigeria's new president. From the beginning of Abacha's rule, Tell took a critical tone in its reporting on his government. Igiebor set a policy that the magazine would never refer to Abacha as \\"head of state\\", preferring the terms \\"junta\\" or \\"dictator\\" to describe his rule. The government responded with a campaign of harassment and imprisonment of the magazine's staff, as well as journalists from other publications, leading the Committee to Protect Journalists to issue a report describing the Nigerian independent press as in \\"deep crisis\\". In March 1995, George Mbah, the magazine's assistant editor, was arrested and jailed on a charge of \\"attempting to stage a military coup\\", and was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment by a secret military tribunal. On 25 December of the same year, as Igiebor was leaving his home in Lagos to go to Tell office, he was arrested by six State Security Service agents and taken to State Security Service headquarters. Agents also seized 55,000 copies of the Christmas issue of Tell bearing a cover story critical of Abacha. Tell managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, went into hiding. The remaining staff released a statement after the arrests, saying that \\"State terrorism and acts of brutal intimidation will not force us to compromise our belief in freedom, justice and the rule of law.\\" Imprisonment Igiebor was put in solitary confinement and denied access to his family, lawyer, and medical care. On 8 January 1996, the Federal High Court in Lagos ordered that Igiebor's wife, Harit Igiebor, should be allowed to visit her husband to give him some needed medication, but when she visited the jail the following day, she was denied access. Later that month, the government announced that Igiebor would be charged under \\"Decree 2 of 1984 for acts prejudicial to state security\\". In February, state security agents confiscated 100,000 copies of Tell, and Igiebor's attorney filed a lawsuit against the federal government for US$1,400,000. The attorney was then himself imprisoned without charge. The Committee to Protect Journalists launched a letter-writing campaign demanding his release, as did Amnesty International. The latter organisation also designated him a prisoner of conscience. He continued to be held incommunicado for a total of more than six months, until 24 June 1996, when he was released along with six other political detainees. Awards and recognition In 1993, the Committee to Protect Journalists presented Igiebor their International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". Bill Orme, an editor of CPJ, commented: \\"What distinguished Nosa is that he is still producing and his organisation (Tell) is still reporting the news in a very lively and combative way\\". In 1998, Nosa Igiebor and the staff of Tell magazine as a whole were awarded the Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat at the Amnesty International UK Media Awards. The award's notice stated; \\"Tell has continued to publish throughout the period of Nigerian dictatorship despite intimidation, harassment and the detention without charge or trial of Mr Igiebor and other senior members of the Tell staff.\\" Present development Igiebor is now the president of TELL Communications alongside Dele Omotunde and Osifo Whiskey. After the era of the military rule in Nigeria, Igiebor and other journalists in Nigeria are reluctant in the practice of journalism.

Set in England immediately after the Second World War, the novel narrates the story of Edward Allison, an English soldier who had been badly wounded during the war. Back among his family, Edward must deal with his war trauma, long buried family conflicts, and his destabilized sense of self. The novel treats such themes as the search for the self, guilt and responsibility, the struggle between the sexes, war and violence, and religion, among others. Döblin wrote the novel between August 1945 and October 1946, although it was not published until a decade later. Upon its 1956 release by the East Berlin publishing house Rütten & Loening, the novel was well received. The reference to Hamlet in the German title was likely motivated by Döblin's reading of Sigmund Freud's interpretation of Shakespeare's Hamlet.

It is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Description In the past doubts have been raised about the attribution of this painting to Bruegel: the name of Joos de Momper, a landscape painter who became a master in the Antwerp guild in 1581, has been mentioned.Cf. Entry with video critique . See also, I. Haberland, \\"Momper, de\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press. However, not only is this painting superior to any by de Momper; its similarity to a drawing by Bruegel (in the Courtauld Institute of Art) and its originality of composition and delicacy of execution have made it generally accepted as a late work by Bruegel, possibly left unfinished at his death. The prominence of the barrel and the whale has led the painting to be associated with the contemporary saying: > If the whale plays with the barrel that has been thrown to him and gives the > ship time to escape, then he represents the man who misses the true good for > the sake of futile trifles.Cf.

He was Count Palatine and captain (immediate vassal) of the Holy Roman Empire and lived in Milan, in the parish of San Simpliciano. Biography He entered public life in 1386, when he was elected Council Settler for Sestiere Comacina in Milan. A few years later the Duke of Milan wanted him among his advisers. He had also political and military roles outside Milan. In 1403 the City of Piacenza asked him to support before the Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti the request to set up four teams for the defense of the city, in order to end the power of the Anguissola family. In 1412, he was appointed Mayor and Captain of the Army of Bologna. When, in the same year, Estorre Visconti was proclaimed Lord of Milan, Giovanni Aliprandi returned home. After Filippo Maria Visconti occupied with troops the city of Milan, Estorre Visconti, his sister Valentina and her husband Giovanni Aliprandi fled to Monza with their allies. Here the resistance was tenacious until Estorre Visconti died and, because of severe food shortage, Valentina Visconti agreed to surrender with honor in the hands of Captain who ran the siege, Francesco Bussone, called Count of Carmagnola. Nothing is known about Giovanni Aliprandi and his wife and children, for over ten years afterwards. In 1425 they were in Treviso. There lived also the Count of Carmagnola, who had stopped serving the Duke of Milan and was offering his services to the Venetian Republic. Documents that came to light in 1800, after the end of the Republic of Venice, and those of the Visconti Archive, show that Giovanni Aliprandi conspired to kill the Count of Carmagnola, in hope to convince the Duke of Milan (his cousin) to remove the ban which had affected his family.

He hold 2 outright Lap records at Mondello Park (National Reverse) and Bishopscourt Co Down. Career O'Connell started competing in motorsport in go-karts in 1994 with his friend Denis Hogan. After a few races in an old kart, he sold it and later purchased his own saloon car. He bought a scrapped 1990 Honda Civic 1.6 si and converted it into a hillclimb car in 1999 in order to compete on the Irish Hillclimb circuit. His first event was the Limerick Hillclimb in Newcastlewest, run by Limerick Motor Club, in which he drove an Historic Hillman Avenger Tiger with Denis Hogan Jnr. He won best Novice on his first day and 3rd in class on the next. He competed in the non-championship Lyre Hillclimb run by the Killarney and District Motor club at the end of the year and met Senan O'Connor and Simon McKinley whom he would go on to compete against during the next ten years. =2002= After selling his Honda Civic Hillclimb car he bought a Delta t79 single seater. This single seater had been competing in Ireland since 1980, on racing tracks and in hillclimbs, and had been lying idle for a number of years following the death of its owner. Powered by a 2.0 litre Ford SOHC engine, in it he learned how to drive single seaters at Irish Hillclimb venues. At his first outing in the car at the Carlow Car Club sprint in Tynagh, he won the event outright. Despite still being in college and working, he managed to compete in the national championship every year even though he had very limited funds. =2006= Having fitted a Connaught Competition Engines 2.3 litre Ford SOHC engine he won his first ever Championship round in Muine Bheag and again the following week in Clare at the Scalp Hillclimb. He finished 3rd overall in the National Championship. =2007= Paul O'Connell debuted a much changed Delta Single seater with a Connaught Competition Engines 2.3 litre Warrior engine fitted to the Delta. Sporting some ex-Williams F1 front and rear wings and using wider magnesium wheels this transformed the Delta into a competitive car to challenge for the National title against drivers such as Frank Burns, Simon McKinley and Sylvie Mullins. Following a good start to the year in which he won or was second in the first eight rounds, he suffered an engine failure in Carlow. He borrowed an older tired 2 litre engine from John Naylor and won the championship for the first time, ahead of Frank Burns and Simon McKinley, despite not winning any more rounds. =2008= Driving his \\"Delta Warrior\\", he won the Irish Championship again in 2008. He dominated events during the first half of the season but later, a series of electrical problems led to restricted running and he did not finish in Tipperary. His car suffered a rear suspension failure on the first day of the MEC but, following some hasty repair work, he won in Donegal on the Knockalla Hillclimb ahead of Simon McKinley and Seamus Morris. =2009= 2009 saw a tussle all year between Paul O'Connell and Simon McKinley. Still driving the old Delta, Paul O'Connell put up a stiff fight to McKinley who chose between the Lant Rt1, the Warrior Escort a Radical sr3 and even a Lola f3000 Judd during the year. Again a good start to the season put O'Connell in the lead winning in Wexford and scoring maximum points in Galway. A double win in Carlow meant he could sit out the MEC event and rely on Donegal to score well. 4th place up against the most powerful cars in the country on day 1 put pressure on for day 2 which was run in wet conditions and reduced the power advantage of the faster cars allowing O'Connell to win on day 2 ahead of Simon McKinley. =2010= In 2010, he disposed of his 31-year-old Delta and bought a 2.8 litre Pilbeam MP58 Hart. The first time he drove this car was up to the start line on the first weekend in Galway where he finished second on both days behind McKinley in the Lant. They both broke the record at Ballyalaban on Sunday bringing it down to 95.00 seconds for 2.2 miles. O'Connell finish a hundredth of a second behind on 95.01 in his new Pilbeam. The car but had to be adapted to Irish Hillclimb conditions during the year. Restricted running due to the Engine mileage put more pressure on but O'Connell finished second consistently pushing McKinley, and well ahead of the rest of the field. A solitary win in Wexford and the fact that McKinley did not finish put O'Connell ahead coming into the final round. A rear brake disc failure crossing the finish line in practice in Knockalla pitched the Pilbeam into a roll at 102 mph and took all four wheels off the car. O'Connell was uninjured except for a sore neck and bruised ribs. He continued in his Delta for the day but it was no longer competitive against the new generation of faster cars and McKinley won his first Championship title. =2011= With the Pilbeam still being repaired and faced with tough financial times O'Connell did not take part in the 2011 season. He brought out the Delta in Wexford to support the new reduced entry fees and put all efforts into rebuilding the Pilbeam for the 2012 season. The Pilbeam rebuild was completed immediately before the Irish Festival of Speed held in Adare Manor in Limerick. He had not driven the car since the Donegal crash a year previous but still managed to finish 3rd overall. He married his fiancée in November 2011. 2012-2017 He competed in selected Hillclimb events in Ireland and in Europe in a variety of cars from the Delta Ff2000, a BMW E30 with a V10 Engine to a Norma M20b sportscar. 2018 Having sold the other cars he bought a Dallara F302 Opel and decided to take on a new challenge of Circuit Racing in the Formulaboss Ireland Championship. He won this championship on his first attempt after a season long battle with ex Hillclimb driver Sylvie Mullins. He also competed in the FIA hillclimb masters in Gubbio Italy finishing 33rd overall driving the 2.0 litre F3 car and fastest Irish driver. 2019 having sold the F302, he bought a Dallara World Series V6 in which he won the Formulaboss Ireland Championship again winning 11 of the 13 races and setting two Irish lap records. He also made Irish history by becoming the first Irish Driver to compete and finish on the podium at FIA European Hillclimb championship level.

In the United States, the OPEN Government Data Act of 14 January 2019 defines machine-readable data as \\"data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.\\" The law directs U.S. federal agencies to publish public data in such manner, ensuring that \\"any public data asset of the agency is machine- readable\\". Machine-readable data may be classified in two groups: human- readable data that is marked up so that it can also be read by machines (e.g. microformats, RDFa, HTML), and data file formats intended principally for processing by machines (CSV, RDF, XML, JSON). These formats are only machine readable if the data contained within them is formally structured; exporting a CSV file from a badly structured spreadsheet does not meet the definition. Machine readable is not synonymous with digitally accessible. A digitally accessible document may be online, making it easier for humans to access via computers, but its content is much harder to extract, transform, and process via computer programming logic if it is not machine-readable. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is designed to be both human- and machine-readable, and Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) is used to improve presentation of the data for human readability. For example, XSLT can be used to automatically render XML in Portable Document Format (PDF). Machine- readable data can be automatically transformed for human-readability but, generally speaking, the reverse is not true. For purposes of implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines \\"machine readable format\\" as follows: \\"Format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a web browser or computer system.

He was the first person to portray the Jaguars mascot in the team's history and had the title, Vice President of Mascot Relations.Chapman, David: \\"One cool Cat\\" Jacksonville Daily Record, October 7, 2009 Curtis retired from serving as Jaxson de Ville on June 23, 2015.http://www.news4jax.com/sports/teal-shocker- jaxson-de-ville-retiring/33720660 Biography =College years= HokieBird on the field Dvorak attended Virginia Tech and was selected to be the college’s mascot in his Sophomore year.Marbut, Max: \\"The man inside Jaxson De Ville\\" Jacksonville Daily Record, July 2010 Their mascot, HokieBird, is very popular and plays an active role in all Virginia Tech sports. He competed in and won the National Cheerleaders Association championship in 1996,\\"Former Hokie Birds prowl as cats\\" Virginia Tech Alumni magazine, Spring 1999 then graduated with a major in Communications. =Career= While watching sports mascots on television, Dvorak considered his future. \\"I remember thinking I was funnier than those guys and it had to be a full-time gig.\\" He competed for a mascot job with the Charlotte Knights baseball team but finished second. The Jacksonville Jaguars were starting a mascot program and happened to contact the Knights. They mailed them his audition tape and resume and then the Jaguars invited him to the tryouts on June 1, 1996. Dvorak was judged better than the fifty other hopefuls and was hired to become Jaxson de Ville. Dvorak's first appearance as Jaxson was at the Jaguars' pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers on August 18, 1996.Wright, Teneshia L.: \\"Singer’s Streak Hits Seven\\" Jacksonville.com, August 24, 2001 Entertainment One of the mascot's jobs is to entertain the fans before the game and during breaks in the action.Smith, Michael David: \\"Jaguars Mascot Jaxson de Ville Draws Ire of Colts President Bill Polianz\\" AOL News, November 16, 2007 There is a fine line between entertainment and harassment, and Dvorak enjoys coming close to crossing the line. During a timeout during the 1998 home game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jaxson carried a full-sized figure resembling Kordell Stewart onto the field near the Steelers' huddle and proceeded to trample and punch the effigy. Another timeout saw Jaxson run in front of the Steelers' bench, where he used a Terrible Towel to wipe various parts of his anatomy.\\"Jaxson De Villain\\" Jacksonville.com, October 1, 1999 Disruptive Other visiting teams have taken exception to Jaxson's antics, too. There were so many complaints that \\"Mascot conduct\\" became an agenda item at the NFL Owners meeting in 2000. Dvorak explained, \\"Along with their discussions of revenue sharing and TV deals, one of the topics was how to stop the mascots (from being too disruptive). They showed a 10-minute video and nine and a half minutes were my highlights. It made my parents so proud.\\" As a result, the National Football League added a new rule: \\"Team mascots must stay behind the 6-foot white border at all times during the game. And they are prohibited from engaging in any acts of taunting opposing players, coaches or game officials.\\" Activities Jaxson de Ville with American Idol finalist Phil Stacey Entertaining at the stadium is Dvorak's favorite activity. He planned, practiced and performed daring stunts at Jaguar home games. His exploits included riding a zip-line from the top of the scoreboard to mid-field, parachuting into the stadium, rappelling down the scoreboard, and bungee jumping from a stadium light tower.James: \\"Jaguars Mascot Jaxson Deville Is Still Crazy ... Goes Bungee Jumping\\" Your Mascot Sucks, September 26, 2010 On the field, he was frequently seen on a small scooter, motorized skateboard or golf cart. Dvorak commented. \\"I want to make all the fans laugh, have a good time and be entertained. Everyone who paid a lot of money to go to the games, I want to add to that experience and help make them go home happy. I want them to say ‘I got my money’s worth’.\\" A notable shenanigan involved removing his costume (except the head and shoes) to reveal a yellow bodystocking with black spots and teal G-string, then streaking across the field at the 2010 Pro Bowl.James: \\"Jaxson De Ville Got Mad Props For His Stunt At The 2010 NFL Pro Bowl Game\\" Your Mascot Sucks, March 2009 Dvorak's other responsibility as mascot was to be a goodwill ambassador for the Jaguars. As such, he spent a lot of time visiting schools, charity events, businesses and grand openings to promote the team. He logged between 300 and 400 appearances each year, and was frequently accompanied by several cheerleaders and/or players. They all signed autographs and posed for pictures. Ebola Towel Controversy Dvorak was criticized for displaying a hand-made sign reading \\"Towels Carry Ebola\\" during the Jaguars' October 5, 2014 home game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The sign was in reference to the Steelers' Terrible Towel and the presence of Ebola virus disease in the United States. =Marriage= Dvorak became acquainted with Jacksonville Roar member Melanie McAlister during a 2001 NFL tour to entertain U.S. troops in the middle East.\\"Jaxson de Ville, the ROAR to Travel to Middle East to Visit U.S. Armed Forces\\" Jaguars Press Release, 2001 They began seeing each other, but team rules prohibit fraternization between cheerleaders and players, so Melanie left the squad and enrolled at St. Vincent's School of Medical Sciences in radiology.

They were divorced in May 2014. =Without the costume= He donated time without the costume to many charitable causes as an organizer, or a participant playing golf or tennis. Dvorak emceed the Jacksonville Dancing with the Stars competition in 2009, a benefit for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. He frequently moderates NFL 101, a 2½ hour workshop for women, designed to teach football basics.FitzRoy, Maggie: \\"Hundreds of women flock to the Ponte Vedra Inn & Club to learn Football 101\\" Florida Times-Union, July 23, 2010 In 2010, he was an emcee for Chalk talk, an event that allowed participants to experience how NFL football works behind the scenes.Morse, Allison: \\"Chalk Talk at EverBank Field\\" Florida Times-Union, November 10, 2010 During the 2011 Players Championship, Dvorak chaired the Plaid Party, a charity event which raises money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.Rooney, Jackie: \\"Rooney Bin\\" Florida Times-Union, May 20, 2011 Future As of January 2015, Dvorak had been the mascot for 19 years. He turned 40 in 2014, but had shown no sign of slowing down. During an interview in 2009, he was asked about retiring and responded, \\"I’ve always told myself (I’ll do it) until we win a Super Bowl.\\" Unfortunately, the Jaguars did not win a Super Bowl in 2014 and Curtis had a change of heart and decided to hang up the cat suit on June 23, 2015. After a month of retirement, Dvorak accepted a co-host position on the local television show, \\"First Coast Living\\" and contributing stories to \\"Good Morning Jacksonville\\", both shows on WJXX and WTLV.

He was a native of Detroit, Michigan. A member of the Motown quartet The Originals, Freddie Gorman was also a vital unsung component of the Motown label's formative development. He co-wrote the label's first #1 pop hit \\"Please Mr. Postman\\", by the Marvelettes. In 1964 the biggest selling group of all time, the Beatles released their version, and in 1975 the Carpenters took it back to #1 again. This was the second time in pop history (after \\"The Twist\\" by Chubby Checker) that a song reached #1 in the US twice. In 2006, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Biography =Before Motown= Born in Detroit on April 11, 1939, Gorman developed his bass harmonizing on local street corners, and was still in high school when he made his recorded debut on the Qualitones' 1955 Josie Records single \\"Tears of Love\\". Two years later Gorman and longtime best friends Brian Holland and Sonny Sanders formed the Fideletones. After issuing \\"Pretty Girl\\" on Aladdin Records in 1959, the group splintered and Gorman resumed his day job as a mail carrier. =Songwriter and artist for Motown= Gorman eventually met with fledgling record impresario Berry Gordy while on his route. In time Gordy hired Holland as a staff writer and producer, teaming him with fellow producer Robert Bateman to cut a single for the Motown girl group the Marvelettes. When Marvelette Georgia Dobbins suggested the title \\"Please Mr. Postman,\\" Holland conscripted Gorman for help with the lyrics, although his contributions to the song went unnoted for decades. \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" was nevertheless a hit, topping the Billboard pop chart in the fall of 1961, and Gordy returned the favor by releasing the Gorman solo single \\"The Day Will Come\\" on Motown's Miracle Records subsidiary. Holland and Gorman also continued their songwriting partnership, with collaboration with Berry Gordy for The Supremes' first single \\"I Want a Guy\\". Then, Holland and Gorman expanded to a triumvirate with the addition of Lamont Dozier to make it Holland–Dozier–Gorman. After a series of Motown productions including Mary Wells' \\"Old Love\\", Smokey Robinson & the Miracles \\"Mr. Misery (Let Me Be)\\", The Contours' \\"Pa, I Need a Car\\", the Marvelettes' \\"Forever\\", \\"Someday Someway\\", \\"Goddess of Love\\", \\"Strange I Know\\", and then Gorman was edged out in favor of Holland's brother Edward, and without any contractual leverage in his favor, he continued to his post office position, dropping from sight for a couple of years. Even though he was edged out by Edward Holland, Freddie and Edward wrote Martha Reeves & the Vandellas's \\"There He Is (At My Door)\\". =Songwriter and artist for Golden World= After leaving Motown, Gorman resurfaced that same year in 1964 writing another top 10 pop hit. But for Motown's rival Golden World Records, their blue-eyed soul/doo-wop group The Reflections song \\"(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet\\" was a hit. Then Gorman cut some solo singles, \\"In a Bad Way\\" \\"Take Me Back\\" \\"There Can be Too Much\\" and \\"Can't Get It Out of My Mind\\", for Golden World's sister label Ric-Tic. =Returns to Motown with The Originals= When Gordy acquired Golden World's holdings, Gorman was absorbed back into the Motown ranks and in 1966 was added to the lineup of The Originals, a new vocal group also comprising lead tenor C. P. Spencer, second tenor Hank Dixon, former Anna Records A&R; executive and founding member baritone Walter Gaines, and albeit briefly, Joe Stubbs, brother of the Four Tops' renowned lead Levi Stubbs, who exited to pursue a solo career in the wake of the Originals' debut release, a rendition of the Lead Belly perennial \\"Goodnight Irene\\". The remaining quartet spent the next two years singing backgrounds for recordings artists, such as Jimmy Ruffin (\\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\\"), Stevie Wonder (\\"For Once in My Life\\" and \\"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\\"), David Ruffin (\\"My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\\"), Marvin Gaye (\\"Chained\\" and \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\"), Edwin Starr (\\"War\\" and \\"Twenty-Five Miles\\"), and many more. Just before capturing the attention of Gorman's jogging partner Marvin Gaye, who teamed with wife Anna Gordy to write the soulful ballad \\"Baby I'm for Real\\". After topping the R&B; chart, the single crossed over to pop radio, ascending to the number 14 spot. Gaye also delivered the Originals' follow-up, \\"The Bells\\", which reached the R&B; Top Five and fell shy of the pop Top Ten in 1970. Because of some creative conflicts with Gaye and his brother-in-law Berry Gordy, the group's commercial fortunes nosedived in the years to follow. In the early 1970s, C.P Spencer left the group to pursue a solo career, therefore leaving former Glass House member Ty Hunter to step in. =Life after Motown= Although in 1976 The Originals topped the disco charts with the dance floor classic \\"Down to Love Town\\", the first-ever 12\\" single released via the Motown imprint, their 1978 through 1981 albums with other independent record labels, generated minimal interest, and the group's recording career essentially ground to a halt by the mid-1980s, although they continued touring and recording for small independent labels for years to follow. In 1988, People magazine wrote an illuminating spread about Freddie Gorman. In 1997, Gorman's son Dillon F. Gorman wrote and produced Freddie's independent solo album, It's All About Love. =Transition of The Originals and Gorman's death= Ty Hunter died on February 24, 1981, followed by Joe Stubbs on February 5, 1998. He was with the group for about six months in the 1966, as well as a member of The Falcons, The Contours and 100 Proof. C.P. Spencer died from a heart attack on October 20, 2004, and Freddie Gorman died, of lung cancer, on June 13, 2006 at the age of 67. Walter Gaines died January 17, 2012, after a long illness. Dixon is now the only surviving, and active, founding member of the original group. Reformation of The Originals Following the death of Freddie Gorman in 2006, longtime member Hank Dixon and Hank's daughter Terrie Dixon reformed the Originals as a live touring act with Freddie's son songwriter and producer Dillon F.

In 1931, the theater signed an \\"anti-Shabbat-violation\\" agreement together with the city's two other theaters. Violating the agreement would incur a fine of 300 Israeli liras. Later ticket sales commenced before the end of Shabbat, even though the screenings themselves were after Shabbat. The Haredi community, led by Amram Blau of Neturei Karta, tried to stop this practice, and the theater was severely damaged in two arson attacks (in 1965 and 1975).

Departments * Bengali * Education * English * History * Music * Physical Education * Political Science * Sanskrit * Anthropology * Electronics * Environmental Science * Geography * Mathematics * Nutrition * Physics  History  Maharaja Nandakumar, the political acumen and great martyr of 18th Century Bengal, was the Faujdar of Hooghly and Zamindar (Land-owner) of Basudevpur Mouza, now known as Nandakumar in the district of Purba Medinipur which he got as a gift for his help as a revenue officer to Maharani of Tamluk during her troubled times. Being born in a noble Brahmin family on 1705 at Bhadrapur, Birbhum he was educated in Sanskrit and Arabic, but soon joined as a revenue officer like his father Padnava Roy under East India Company. As a robust personality his firmness and resoluteness confirmed the evil eye of East India Company, particularly Lord Warren Hastings, the then Governor General of Bengal for not supporting misdeeds for his personal gain using the chief post of east India company, As a result , he was mooted as a victim of a forgery case of a deed of one Bulaki Das and ultimately he was accused by the law of the British in place of the Country law particularly when the East India Company was not the supreme ruler of the Country. As justice was denied without allowing a chance of self-defense, he was sentenced to death and was hanged by the British on 5th August, 1775, at Cooli Bazar, Kolkata. The tragedy of his death has remained still like a ballad in the mind of the people of Bengal. To commemorate his death and as a long historical legacy of region, the newly found college has been named after him as “MAHARAJA NANDAKUMAR MAHAVIDYALAYA”. It is situated at the centre of the police station of Nandakumar and surrounded by a high academic environmental zone initially with the support and auspices of ICARE, Haldia, to cater humanistic and scientific knowledge and to uphold the holistic approach to the people of local community in order to generate growth and prosperity of this region as a whole. The local representative of the Legislative Assembly also took initiative for the establishment of this degree college. Kalyan Sebashram Sangha, a pioneer and benevolent organization extended its support with a donation of 5.33 acre of valuable land. Finally, the approval from the Higher Education Department, Government of W.B. and the affiliation from Vidyasagar University, Medinipur, made the foundation of this Mahavidyalaya into reality on the auspicious day, the 6th August, 2007. Though the college in its infant stage was temporarily running in a building of District Child Welfare Department, it was shifted to its own Campus on the 2nd of January, 2015, at Bhabanipur, Kalyanchak. It is now situated by the side of Digha-Howrah High Road, only two kilometer away from NH-41 Crossing. Hon’ble M.P, Tamluk Parliamentary Constituency and Chairman of Haldia Development of Authority, Sri Suvendu Adhikary is gracious enough to allot grants into two phases of Rs. 2.20 Crore for the construction of the present building. At present it has become one of the leading burgeoning colleges under Vidyasagar University. Now the college has been included under Sections 2F and 12B of UGC Act. The college also has a unit of Netaji Subhas Open University which offers 7(Seven) PG course programmes. The process to get NAAC accreditation towards an all-round improvement of the college has been undertaken since then in collaboration with the IQAC, formed in 2016, and other stakeholders who have been working relentlessly to maintain the internal quality of teaching - learning and academic excellence.

The Istanbulkart is valid for boarding buses, funiculars, LRT, subway, commuter trains, ferryboats and trams operated by the Metropolitan Municipality and private companies. Cash payment on these transport systems is not possible. Reduced fees are applicable for up to five transfers within two hours to other vehicles on the transportation network. There are four different types of the Istanbulkart, one ordinary and three special. The special cards are issued upon the holder's legal eligibility, and are therefore personalized: # Ordinary card: for full fare payment, # Mavi Kart (Blue card) (season ticket): seasonal ticket discounted on monthly use basis, # Discounted card: for students, teachers, senior citizens (over 60 years of age) # Free card: for handicapped or disabled persons,senior citizens (over 65 years of age) and government employees underway on duty. The ordinary cards may be acquired from offices at major transport interchanges for a nonrefundable deposit of 10 TL.http://www.wittistanbul.com/magazine/how-to- get-an-istanbul-kart-and-is-it-worth-it/ It can be purchased for 6TL from vending machines located at metro entrances. The remaining sum will be deposited on the card. Afterwards, the cards can be loaded with credits up to 300 TL at these offices, special purpose machines, vending machines on the metro or at news-stands and small shops which offer this service. Cards for a limited number of passes (1, 2, 3, 5 or 10) are also available. Unlike the ordinary cards, the special cards are issued on a named basis, so they require an application to be made at one of the 13 application centers, or on the internet. To pay the fare, the smart card is brought into close proximity, up to , with a contactless reader during boarding of the transportation vehicle or at the toll gates of the station. It is not necessary for the card to touch the reader, cards inside a wallet or a handbag can be also read for rapid payment. The reader device signals confirmation of the fare payment with an audible sound, and the screen turns green showing the payment and the remaining deposit after a split second. In case of insufficient deposit on the smart card, the card reader shows the warning message \\"Yetersiz Bakiye\\" (Insufficient deposit) on its display along with an audible warning. Counterfeit cards will be confiscated by the bus driver or security personnel at the turnpikes. The Istanbulkart is compatible with international standards such as ISO/IEC 7816 and ISO/IEC 14443 and is built using NXP's DESFire technology. Its use is planned to be extended to payments at municipality operated parking lots and theatres, as well as for privately owned taxis, Dolmuş (share taxis) and movie theatres. The personalized type of the smart card can also be used in a more general form for admission to an event or establishment or for municipality provided social welfare purposes.

Singh wrote over 70 books on Sikhism, the most famous of which is Khalsa Akhbar. His Dayanand naal mera Samvaad and Durga Parbodh are considered major texts of Sikh philosophy.  Early life  There is little information regarding the early life of Singh, despite a resurgence of interest in him caused by the desire of some people to recast his life as that of a dalit hero. Anshu Malhotra has argued that such a recasting says more about the motives of the present-day researchers than it does about the effects of social status on Singh himself. While Singh's date of birth is generally recognised as being 21 April, the year is variously stated as 1850, 1852 and 1853. He father, Diwan Singh, was a weaver whose knowledge of the Nyaya and Vedanta religious philosophies was passed on to his son. The family origins lay in the Chamar caste of leatherworkers, from which they had moved to self-identify as members of the relatively ritually clean Ravidasi weaving community, described by Malhotra as an \\"upwardly mobile section of the Chamar community\\". After initial schooling given by his father, Singh was sent at the age of 8 or 9 to be taught by Gurbakhsh Singh and Lala Dayanand in the village of Tiur, Ambala district. There he studied Gurmukhi, Urdu and Persian, as well as prosody, Niti Shastra and Vedanta, until aged around 16. Gurbakhsh Singh was an adherent of the Gulabdasi sect and his pupil's next move was to the Gulabdasi centre at Chathian Wala, near Lahore. Formally initiated into the sect of Sant Desa Singh, he became a Gulabdasi preacher. Not long afterwards, he came under the influence of Bhai Jawahar Singh, formerly a follower of Gulabdasi sect, who had joined the Arya Samaj. Early reform activities Soon, Singh was drawn into the Sikh fold through Bhai Gurmukh Singh, then an active figure in the Singh Sabha movement. In 1886, he became a principal contributor to and subsequently the second editor of the weekly Khalsa Akhbar Lahore, a newspaper founded by Bhai Gurmukh Singh following the establishment of the Lahore Khalsa Diwan. Singh He had passed the Gyani examination the same year and was appointed a teacher at the Oriental College. He used the Khalsa Akhbar as a vehicle for the spread of Singh Sabha ideology. When the Amritsar Khalsa Diwan excommunicated Bhai Gurmukh Singh, Ditt Singh responded by publishing excerpts from his book Svapan Natak, a thinly veiled satire ridiculing the Amritsar leaders, in the Khalsa Akhbar. This resulted in a lawsuit filed by one of the targets of the satire, which, although eventually dismissed, cost the Khalsa Akhbar dearly in time and money to defend. The paper shut down in 1889. With support from the Maharaja of Nahba, the paper resumed publication in 1893, again under Ditt Singh as editor. This led to the eventual launch of an English-language weekly, titled simply Khalsa. Through all of his Sikh Sabha activities, Singh had maintained his ties to the Arya Samaj, but in 1888, the increasing discord between the Arya Samaj and Sikh leaders led to Singh's ultimate departure from the movement. After this, he threw himself entirely into the work of the Singh Sabha movement. As an educator, Singh helped in the setting up of Khalsa College, Amritsar, and wrote textbooks for the students of the college. Discussion with Swami Dayanand Swami Dayanand was the founder of the Arya Samaj movement, but Singh found Dayanand's belief in the supremacy of the Vedas and the role of Hinduism as the sole true religion at odds with the multi-cultural and multi- religious world of the time. Singh planned to set things right. During a religious gathering in 1877 at Lahore, Singh visited Dayanand \\"to know his mind and to know his ideals\\". Singh published these dialogues in his book Sadhu Daya Nand Naal Mera Sambad. During the course of the discussion, Singh takes issue with Dayanand's beliefs, and attempts to expose the fallacies therein. Malhotra describes the discussions with Dayanand as \\"putative\\" and the booklet as \\"controversial\\". Literary career Singh wrote prolifically, producing both prose and verse. He wrote books and pamphlets on Sikh theology and history and on current polemics. Well-known among his works are: * Guru Nanak Prabodh * Guru Arjan Chariltar * Dambh Bidaran * Durga Prabodh * Panth Prabodh * Raj Prabodh * Mera ate Sadhu Dayanand da Sambad * Naqh Siah Prabodh * Panth Sudhar Binai Pattar * Abla Naari He also published accounts of the martyrdoms of Tara Singh of Van, Subeg Singh, Matab Singh Mirankotia, Taru Singh and Bota Singh. Personal life Singh's married Bishan Kaur in a Sikh rite in Lahore in 1880. They had two children: a son, Baldev Singh, born in 1886, and a daughter, Vidyavant Kaur, born in 1890. Death The death of Singh's daughter on 17 June 1901 was a great blow to Singh, who was already suffering exhaustion from his workload as leader of the Singh Sabha movement. He continued to work, but his health deteriorated rapidly and he fell seriously ill. Singh died at Lahore on 6 September 1901. Memorials After Singh's death, Bhai Vir Singh wrote a poem in his honor that was published in the Khalsa Akhbar. In addition, the Giani Ditt Singh Memorial International Society regularly organizes functions to keep Singh's memory alive.

This plant is a rhizomatous vine with climbing, branching stems that grow up to 8 meters long. Many of the branches are covered in prickles up to 9 millimeters long. The evergreen leaves are pale green, sometimes with white blotches, and are variable in shape. The inflorescence is an umbel of up to 15 or more pale green flowers. The fruit is a black berry just under a centimeter in length. It contains one seed. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting from its rhizome. This plant grows in many types of habitat alongside plants such as muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), trumpetcreeper (Campsis radicans), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), and eastern poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). It easily grows in disturbed habitat, and can become weedy. The fruits of this plant provide food for many species of animals, including many birds. The dense, prickly thickets make good cover for small animals. Native Americans found several uses for the plant. The Muscogee people (also known as the Creek people) rubbed the moistened plant on their faces to enhance youthfulness, and the Comanche people used the leaves for cigarette wrappers. The Houma people of Louisiana used Smilax bona-nox roots to treat urinary tract infections and to make bread and cake.

It opened in 2008 on the site of the old Florin Mall, which closed and was demolished in 2006. The center is anchored by 24 Hour Fitness, AutoZone, PetSmart and Walmart Supercenter. History = Florin Mall = Florin Mall (originally named Florin Center) was built by the James J. Cordano Company and Blumenfield Enterprises. The single-level center was situated on , southeast of downtown Sacramento. It was the Sacramento area's first fully enclosed shopping mall built from the ground up. The site had previously been utilized as the Sky Ranch Airfield. The mall was opened in February 1968 and was anchored by a 3-level, , Sacramento-based Weinstock's, which held its grand opening October 9, 1967. The mall also included a 2-level, Sears and a 2-level, JCPenney. Surrounding the mall were Montgomery Ward (now Burlington), Zody's and a White Front discount store. On March 23, 1968 during the 1968 US presidential campaign, Senator Robert F Kennedy made a campaign stop at the recently opened Florin Mall. The only physical expansion of the shopping center was completed in 1978. A 1-level, addition was built at the main entrance at the front of the mall, increasing its gross leasable area to . As the second mall-type center on Sacramento's south side, it eclipsed its nearest commercial competitor, Southgate Plaza. The former White Front store became Price Club in 1982. By the 1980s, Florin Mall was becoming rather notorious as a haven for shootings, stabbings and car thefts. Local gangs had made the complex a regular hangout spot by the early 1990s. Customers began wafting to other frequent regional centers, such as Arden Fair Mall, Downtown Plaza and Sunrise Mall. A remodeling of Weinstock's in 1989 and a facelift renovation of the mall proper in the second half of 1990 did little to dispel the negative image that the center had taken on, especially in 1991 when four perpetrators took 41 people hostage at a Good Guys! electronics store that was adjacent to the mall. It resulted in the deaths of three hostages, injuring 14 others and remains, to this day, the largest hostage rescue operation in U.S. history. In 1994, Price Club relocated to South Sacramento (now Costco). With the acquisition of Weinstock's by Federated Department Stores in August 1995, it was decided that the Florin Mall location be shuttered rather than converting it to Macy's. The store closed in March 1996. This was seen as the first significant decline to Florin Mall. JCPenney was converted to an outlet store in November 1998. The store was shuttered in 2003, leaving Sears as the sole anchor of the mall. In a state of disrepair for some time, the bulk of Florin Mall was purchased by San Francisco's Jim Kessler and Prudential Insurance Company in October 2005. The mall closed on February 28, 2006. It was fully demolished in July 2006 (including the former JCPenney and Weinstock's anchors) leaving Sears, its Auto Center, and five outparcels standing. = Florin Towne Centre = Mervyn's opened on March 6, 2008 and was the first store to open at Florin Towne Centre. The store was shuttered in February 2009 when the entire chain went out of business. It sat vacant the majority of the time (aside from temporary usage for seasonal retailers such as Halloween City) until 2019 when AutoZone opened in a portion of the former Mervyn's. Walmart opened on June 17, 2009, replacing a former store to the west (the old store re-opened six years later as Walmart's Neighborhood Market format in 2015, occupying only half of the old store's original footprint, but later closed in 2019). PetSmart opened on November 12, 2011 in a building adjacent to the former Mervyn's that was originally intended for Old Navy, but never opened.

While most systems of the body show some degree of autoregulation,Autoregulation the brain is very sensitive to over- and underperfusion. Cerebral autoregulation plays an important role in maintaining an appropriate blood flow to that region. Brain perfusion is essential for life since the brain has a high metabolic demand. By means of cerebral autoregulation the body is able to deliver sufficient blood containing oxygen and nutrients to the brain tissue for this metabolic need, and remove CO2 and other waste products. Cerebral autoregulation Cerebral autoregulation refers to the physiological mechanisms that maintain blood flow at an appropriate level during changes in blood pressure. However, due to the important influences of arterial carbon dioxide levels, cerebral metabolic rate, neural activation, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, posture, as well as other physiological variables, cerebral autoregulation is often interpreted as encompassing the wider field of cerebral blood flow regulation. This field includes areas such as CO2 reactivity, neurovascular coupling and other aspects of cerebral haemodynamics. This regulation of cerebral blood flow is achieved primarily by small arteries, arterioles, which either dilate or contract under the influence of multiple complex physiological control systems. Impairment of these systems may occur e.g. following stroke, trauma or anaesthesia, in premature babies and has been implicated in the development of subsequent brain injury. The non-invasive measurement of relevant physiological signals like cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, blood pressure, CO2 levels, cerebral oxygen consumption, etc. is challenging. Even more so is the subsequent assessment of the control systems. Much remains unknown about the physiology of blood flow control and the best clinical interventions to optimize patient outcome. Physiological mechanisms Three different mechanisms are thought to contribute to the process of cerebral autoregulation. These are metabolic, myogenic and neurogenic. =Metabolic regulation= Metabolic regulation is driven by the difference between cerebral metabolism (demand) and oxygen delivery through cerebral blood flow (supply) and acts by means of a vasoactive substance. In principle, this is a negative feedback control system that seeks to balance cerebral blood flow to its demand. =Myogenic regulation= The effect of transmural blood pressure changes is directly detected by the vascular smooth muscle in arterioles, probably via a stress sensing mechanism. Then, the calibers are adjusted accordingly to keep blood flow constant. =Neurogenic regulation= The vascular smooth muscle actuators in the resistance arterioles are controlled via sympathetic innervation, receiving the input from the appropriate brainstem autonomous control center. Nitric oxide released by parasympathetic fibers may also play a role. Assessment of cerebral autoregulation In order to assess cerebral autoregulation one must at least continuously measure arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Because CO2 levels are of great influence to cerebral autoregulation it is recommended to also continuously measure CO2. =Measuring arterial blood pressure= Arterial blood pressure can be measured invasively using an arterial line. However, noninvasive finger arterial pressure can also be measured using a volume clamp technique. This technique uses a combination of an inflatable finger cuff and an infrared plethysmograph. =Measuring cerebral blood flow= Cerebral blood flow can be quantified in various ways of which three noninvasive means are currently much used. These are Transcranial Doppler sonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Near Infrared Spectroscopy. =Quantification of cerebral autoregulation= The quantification of cerebral autoregulation always involves variation seen in cerebral blood flow in relation to changes in blood pressure. This blood pressure variation can either be evoked or spontaneous. Evoked blood pressure changes can be the result of: * releasing leg cuffs that were inflated above systolic pressure * breathing at a fixed rate * performing a Valsalva maneuver * performing squat-stand or sit-stand maneuvers * lower body negative pressure * pharmaceutical methods to raise or lower blood pressure The quantification depends on the experimental setup and can involve methods such as regression, cross-correlation, transfer function analysis or fitting mathematical models. Measuring and understanding cerebral autoregulation remains a big challenge. Despite great clinical interest and much research effort, benefit to patients has so far been limited.

His work was characterized by a consistent commitment to the depiction of the landscape, not following ever-changing trends of contemporary art in the 20th century. In an October 2000 Baltimore Sun article Glenn McNatt wrote that, \\"For the past quarter century, Leake has been recording that landscape in all its moods and seasons, from riotous sun-drenched spring mornings to the magical glow of autumnal sunsets. His paintings are imbued with an unmistakable sense of place that only one who has lived in and loved the surrounding landscape can create.\\"McNatt, Glenn. \\"The Light Years of Landscapist Eugene Leake.\\" The Baltimore Sun 22 Oct. 2000, Arts sec. The Baltimore Sun. The Baltimore Sun. Web. 7 Feb. 2012 \\"Leake belongs to the long tradition of American artists who have had often-rapturous love affairs with nature. His work are heirs to the spirit of the oil sketches of English master John Constable (1776-1837) and the early works of French landscape artist Camille Corot (1796-1875), both of whom insisted that painting must be based on observable facts and reflect the truth of the moment.\\" In a 1993 ARTnews article Tom Weisser wrote: \\"Leake's great strength is his ability to capture the essence of things with economy and easy grace. Light, space, and climate materialize in his pictures from what seems to be an absolute minimum of brushwork. His paint has a soft, buttery quality. Yet the viewer can almost feel the flat, hard cold of Leake's gray winter mornings, the snap of his autumn afternoons, and the electricity in his gathering summer skies.\\"Weisser, Tom. \\"Eugene Leake.\\" Rev. of C. Grimaldis Gallery. ARTnews Feb. 1993: 120. Print. Early life Eugene Leake was born in Jersey City, New Jersey on August 31, 1911, one of two sons born to Eugene W. Leake and Marion (Paige) Leake. Growing up he was surrounding by paintings belonging to his grandfather. The collection included, American painters, Ralph Blakelock, J. Francis Murphy, and E. Irving Couse.Hankin, Craig. Maryland Landscapes of Eugene Leake. Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins UP, 1986. Print. As a teenage student at the Hill School in Pittston, Pennsylvania Leake requested an art class so frequently that the school hired an instructor from Philadelphia to teach him once a week. Leake explains, \\"'Here was an artist who rode the train up from Philadelphia every Saturday morning to teach me and one other boy - two students out of 450,' says Leake, his voice still tinged with disbelief.'\\" Early career In 1930 Leake briefly attended the Yale School of Fine Arts but soon dropped out having found \\"... its Beaux Arts orientation tedious and uninspiring.\\" Next, he left Connecticut and traveled south. At twenty-two, Leake traveled through the southwest and California before returning to Connecticut. Back in New England, Leake built a studio and made a living painting commissioned portraits and teaching art classes. In 1937 he joined the Art Students League in New York and began showing his paintings at galleries in the area. He had his first one-man show at the Walker Gallery in 1937 after which he was invited to participate in national group shows at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Brooklyn Museum. During World War II, Leake first took a job at a defense plant, then later joined the Navy, where he continued to paint watercolors during his off hours. After the war Leake became the director of The Art Center in Louisville, Kentucky and held the position for a decade. Then, at age 48, decided to finish his degree at Yale School of Art and Architecture. The artist subsequently earned his BFA in 1960 and his MFA in 1962. When Eugene Leake attended Yale University, Josef Albers had recently retired from the chair of the School of Art but continued to be a presence on campus. Leake described an experience with the Bauhaus master: \\"Albers came to my studio one day. I was painting semi-abstract landscapes, horizontal bands of color. He said to me, 'I've heard about you. You are de old Prix de Rome - type painter. Mit underpainting und all dot garbage?' I said, 'Yeah, I learned all that.' And Albers looked at my painting and said, 'Vot you doing here? Dis is about color! It's a metamorphosis!'\\" Maryland Institute College of Art In June 1961 Eugene Leake moved to Maryland after graduating from Yale to \\"take on the task of reviving the nearly moribund Maryland Institute,\\" as its new President. \\"He recruited the best artists he could find as teachers, among them the painters Grace Hartigan and Raoul Middleman, sculptors Norman Carlberg and Stephanie Scuris, and painter-printmaker Peter Milton.\\" \\"Leake has found success and recognition not only as an artist but as one of the finest teachers and arts administrators of the recent past. He was for 13 years president of the Maryland Institute College of Art, an institution he almost single-handedly remade from a cobwebbed, struggling vocational training academy into one of the most respected art schools in the nation.\\" Despite his demanding schedule at the Maryland Institute College of Art, the painter never stopped painting and developing. In 1974 Leake retired from his role as president of the Maryland Institute College of ArtGiuliano, Mike. \\"The View From Monkton: Eugene Leake's Dramatic Late Work.\\" City Paper [Baltimore] 26 Jan. 1994.

Mid to late career \\"When he retired from the Institute in 1974, he was 63 and [the school's] renaissance was assumed to be his life's magnum opus. But he retired to the rural Maryland countryside north of Baltimore, where he took up the solitary life of a creative artist and [continued as] a successful and respected landscape painter.\\"Dorsey, John. \\"Putting Truth to Canvas.\\" Rev. of C.

In the autumn of 1974 Eugene Leake became the first Johns Hopkins University artist-in-residence. He \\"founded the program as an informal opportunity for Hopkins students, regardless of experience, to learn the fundamentals of drawing and painting -- to learn to see.\\" In The Baltimore Sun art critic Glenn McNatt described Leake's work and legacy: \\"Leake's brushstroke was like the man himself: precise, energetic, joyous, and ever attuned to the mysterious universal vibration through which paint is transformed into a living thing. Though his art looked exceedingly simple, it was also miraculous, and for this he was, and will be forever, beloved by generations of Marylanders.\\"McNatt, Glenn. \\"A Painter of Simple, Honest Art.\\" The Sun [Baltimore] 23 Jan. 2005, Arts & Society sec.: 8E.

Description The panel, neither signed nor dated, was painted circa 1567, at about the same time as The Peasant Wedding. The paintings are the same size and may have been intended as a pair or as part of a series illustrating peasant life.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, Skira, Milano 2003. They are the two most outstanding examples of Bruegel's late style, which is characterized by his use of monumental Italianate figures.There is another version of this subject by Bruegel in a painting in the Detroit Institute of Arts, entitled The Wedding Dance (see image at Wikimedia: \\"Bruegel dance 1566 Detroit\\"). It is dated 1566 and although the surface is rather worn, it is today generally accepted as an authentic work from Bruegel's own hand. The composition is more crowded and in consequence more effective than the Vienna picture. =Details= Detail from leftmost composition Like The Peasant Wedding, it is likely that Bruegel intended this painting to have a moral sense rather than simply being an affectionate portrayal of peasant life. Gluttony, lust and anger can all be identified in the picture. The man seated next to the bagpipe player wears a peacock feather in his hat, a symbol of vanity and pride.See Grove Art Online The occasion for the peasants' revelry is a Saint's day, but dancers turn their backs on the church and pay no attention whatsoever to the image of the Virgin Mary which hangs on the tree.

The play is a story about a man named Sidney, his pitfalls within his personal life, and struggles in Bohemian culture. The play premiered October 15, 1964 and received mixed reviews. It encompasses themes of race, suicide, and homosexuality, and also focuses on individual characters learning to cope with life. History Lorraine Hansberry, the author of The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window, had several works produced prior to this piece. Hansberry used to write for a paper as an author before deciding to write her first play. Before becoming a playwright, she actively wrote for groups promoting African-American rights. She published a piece produced by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, advocating for the well being of African Americans. Hansberry's personal past, values, and involvement with ideological movements heavily influenced thematic elements in her plays. Her first piece as a playwright, A Raisin in the Sun, drew attention to her as not only an author but as playwright. This piece received several awards and was the first Broadway production written by an African-American woman. After this play, Lorraine continued to write, leading to the production of her next play, The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window. Production =Original Broadway production= The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on October 15, 1964, and was directed by Peter Kass. Jack Blackman designed scenery, Jules Fisher designed lighting, and Fred Voelpel designed costumes. The original Broadway cast featured Gabriel Dell as Sidney Brustein, Rita Moreno as Iris Parodus Brustein, Ben Aliza as Alton Scales, Frank Schofield as Wally O'Hara, Dolph Sweet as Max, Alice Ghostley as Mavis Parodus Bryson, John Alderman as David Ragin, Cynthia O'Neal as Gloria Parodus, and Joseph Elic as the policeman. Ten days after opening night, it was announced that the play was in jeopardy of closing. On November 30, 1964, actor and playwright Ossie Davis made an appeal for funds following a matinee performance, which raised only $5,000. =Chicago production= In 2016 the play was performed in the author's hometown at the Goodman Theatre to a positive critical response. Jones, Chris, \\"Lorraine Hansberry's overlooked 1964 drama a masterful rediscovery at Goodman,\\" Chicago Tribune A+E, pp. 1, 4; May 11, 2016 Synopsis The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window depicts Sidney, an intellectual writer and his wife, Iris, who are in a difficult marriage. Sidney struggles through life in New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood as an unsuccessful artist. His ideals cause him to avoid politics and its corruption while facing a painful home life. Iris is a struggling actress who, during the course of the play, leaves her antagonistic husband to enter the television scene. Both Sidney and Iris attack each other's self- confidence through extensive dialogue, despite their affection for each other. Alton Scales is an African-American activist and Sidney's friend who falls in love with Iris's beautiful sister Gloria, a supposed international model. He is able to persuade Sidney to support the candidacy of Wally O’Hara despite Sidney's initial refusal to incorporate politics into his newly established artistic newspaper. Wally is a local reform politician who is appalled by the extensive drug use in Greenwich Village and the surrounding area. Sidney agrees to support him but later learns of O’Hara’s corruption; afterwards Sidney harbors significant hatred for the reform politician. Gloria's idealistic image is shattered when Alton learns that she is a prostitute and not an international model as she and her sister Iris had insisted. Wrought with anguish at the idea of his beloved being used as a commodity, and tying it to the same ideology used to justify the African slave trade (to which he traces his roots), Alton leaves Gloria. In an act of desperation and shame, she commits suicide. Attributing Gloria's suicide to the campaigning slogans of Wally, Sidney develops a position in opposition to the politician. This creates problems that reconcile Sidney and Iris. The play ends with a scene of Sidney and Iris in a devastated embrace at the loss of Gloria. Iris indicates with her last lines of the play that she wants to come home. Sidney makes a silent agreement that they will figure everything out. Despite the constant dark bickering that the two had throughout the play, it closes while the two are interlocked as the sun rises. The play is presented in various ways through its acts: Act I consists of dialogue, Act II consists of multiple monologues tying together Acts I and Act II, while Act III ends tragically, concluding the play. Response =Critical reception= Howard Taubman wrote in The New York Times following the opening performance of The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window that the play \\"lacks concision and cohesion\\" and that \\"one remembers isolated passages rather than the work as a whole.\\" Dramatic analysis The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window was first on stage in the 1960s, a time of great social reform in America. Carl and Nanie Hansberry, Lorraine Hansberry's parents, were leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, and her parents' values affected her writing. =Social movements= One prominent social movement in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window is the non-conformist or bohemian movement. The play revolves around Sidney Brustein and his non- conformist lifestyle. The setting is Sidney's apartment in Greenwich Village. Hansberry describes this area as \\"bohemia\\" - a place where people relish living an unglamorous and nontraditional life. Sidney's apartment parallels the bohemian atmosphere in Greenwich Village. The apartment differs from contemporary homes because it has an endearing \\"carelessness.\\" Sidney's style even goes against social norms, rather than the \\"toggle-coated, woven, mustardy, corduroy appearance\\". Sidney dresses without concern for what others think. Iris's sister, Mavis Parodus, is a source of contempt for Sidney because she is \\"the Mother of MiddleClass itself\\" and her prejudices. The interaction between Mavis and Sidney in Act 1, Scene 2 show Sidney's contempt for Mavis, and her anti-African-American prejudice and anti-Semitism. When Mavis leaves Sidney's apartment, she makes comments on how the bohemian culture isn't as enlightened as they believe. It isn't until Sidney experiences a change in understanding that he sees Mavis's true colors and realize that she also has the qualities of \\"awareness, sensitivity, integrity, and, above all, the capacity for growth.\\" Sidney also develops a better understanding for Mavis in their last Aspects of The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window can be seen as Hansberry's reaction to a popular movement in theatre, Theater of the Absurd. Theatre of the Absurd was a form of drama which mixed clarity with absurdity, profundity with ridiculousness. It was understood to reflect the lack of coherence in most people's lives, and the endless search for meaning in a life with no purpose, no certainty, no god, and no absolute values. Hansberry's play juxtaposes an absurd character, David Ragin, and the socially concerned Sidney Brustein. The arguments of the two display Hansberry's critique of searching for meaning; instead, she argues through Sidney Brustein, one should search for how to live. The humanist in Sidney reflects Hansberry's commitment to social values and human rights. =Underground press= The underground press was a movement during the 1960s that gave rise to independent, bohemian newspapers. These papers were easily accessible to amateurs because newspaper production became cost-effective after photo-offset printing. In the play, Harvey Wyatt \\"unloads\\" a small, community paper on Sidney, which is representative of the underground press movement. Sidney cites that he wants the paper to be a part of the Greenwich Village culture. The amateur, counter-culture quality this paper is reflected in the \\"artistic\\" approach Max takes when designing the layout for the paper. In Act 1 scene 2, Alton and Max disagree about the nameplate, which Max puts in a small font at the bottom of the page. =Racial and cultural traditions= Margaret Wilkerson, an acclaimed African-American historian and playwright, criticized the play because it was not about the \\"black experience.\\" Sidney Brustein, a white, Jewish male, is the main character. Hansberry's only African-American character is Alton. Sidney has deep connection with his Judaism, and with that connection comes an understanding of oppression, which connects him with the oppressed African Americans of that time period. This connection is represented in Sidney's feelings for Alton. Hansberry also connects Sidney with the Gay rights movement in the 1960s through David, a gay playwright. Sidney has disputes with David, but he offers support and advice for David's troubles. Sidney's opinion on dealing with prejudices are \\"aggressive,\\" and they mimic Hansberry's opinions on dealing with prejudice. Themes and motifs The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window reflects many cultural disputes of the time one of which is women's struggle for equality.Snodgrass, Mary Ellen. \\"Hansberry, Lorraine\\". Encyclopedia of Feminist Literature. New York, New York: Facts on File, 2006. Print. The women in the play struggle to be recognized in a male-dominated world. Iris Brustein, the wife of the title character, is chastised by Sidney for her costly acting classes while he constantly makes equally flippant monetary decisions without consulting her. She finally takes her own stand by leaving him. Iris's sister Gloria commits suicide after her fiance rejects her when he finds out she is a prostitute, a label she cannot escape. Iris's other sister Mavis represents the theme of social stigmas. She chastises Gloria's prostitution and black fiance, and does not see how anyone has a different mindset than her own. Another theme in the play is the frailty of the human race.Anderson, Michael. “Education of Another Kind: Lorraine Hansberry in the Fifties.” Gender Nonconformity, Race, and Sexuality: Charting the Connections. Ed. Toni Lester. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2002, pp. 210–216. The characters all have personal flaws. Gloria cannot face the challenge of coming to terms with her life choices while Alton fails to look past her flaws. Iris and Sidney are unable to see what they have until tragedy strikes. Throughout the play these intrinsic flaws represent the imperfection of people.

It is known for its alternative staging and use of a solely female cast.  Synopsis =Plot= Fefu and her Friends is set in New England in the spring of 1935. The story takes the audience through an amazing entire day beginning in the noon and ending in the evening; it climaxes in a death scene. The play is split into three parts. It begins in the living room of Fefu's country house. Part 2 is set in four different areas of the house: the lawn, the study, the bedroom, and the kitchen. Fornés deconstructs the familiar stage, removing the fourth wall, and scenes are played in multiple locations simultaneously throughout the theater. The audience is divided into groups to watch each scene, then they rotate to the next set, as the scene is repeated until each group has seen all four scenes. Fefu and her seven female friends gather at Fefu's house to rehearse a presentation for their charity toward school education. Each character plays a role in this event. Before and after their rehearsal, the women interact with one another, and with male characters, and share their thoughts and feelings about life along with their personal struggles and societal concerns. Fornés portrays these characters as real women, in a shift in her playwriting style to realism and naturalism in settings, characters and situations.Diane, Moroff Lynn. Fornes Theater in the Present Tense, The University of Michigan Press, 1996.William, Gruber E. \\"The Characters of Maria Irene Fornes: Public and Private Identities\\", Missing Persons Character and Characterization in Modern Drama, The University of Georgia Press, 1994, pp. 155–81 = Action = The majority of the triggers begin with Fefu in her desire to express control over her friends. Her use of the gun and her overall organization of the rehearsal for the play places the other characters in positions of submission. Fefu has two sides according to Kelda Lynn Jordan- the controlling trait and the motherly trait. Fefu also criticizes herself and women in the play as being lesser than men, which also shows her preference for male traits. Jordan also comments on the meek stereotypical weakness of the other characters such as Paula, Sue, Christina, and Cindy. The only woman who stands against Fefu is Julia and this makes Fefu more aggressive toward her, leading her to kill the rabbit that symbolizes her loss of power and control. The actions of the play demonstrate the daily power struggles of women in a society that is dominated by men. According to Robert Wilson, Fefu and Her Friends “challenges our preconceptions of life” and that Julia’s final wound in the end is “our own.”  Characters  Fefu (originally played by Rebecca Schull) – the main character who has many male characteristics. She struggles against her femininity with her relationship with her off-stage husband, Phillip. Fornés depicts her as always seeking control. Fefu adds humor with her game where she shoots at her husband and toys around the danger of not knowing if the gun is loaded. Her biggest scene is during Part 3 in her confession with Julia. Fefu states, \\" I need him Julia. I need his touch. I need his kiss. I need the person he is...I am frightened and I am overbearing.\\" The weakness and truth of her character comes out to the audience. In the end, she shoots and kills a rabbit. At the same time, the shot affects her friend Julia, who mysteriously dies from a head wound. Cindy (originally played by Gwendolyn Brown) – one of the first characters introduced in the country house. She was present when Julia was paralyzed the day a hunter almost shot her a year prior. The majority of her actions are with her friend, Christina including their conversation together in the study of Part 2. In this act, Cindy describes a dream she had of taking control while a young doctor attempted to fondle her. Christina (originally played by Carolyn Hearn) – also one of the first characters introduced in Part 1. Her character appears disturbed and confused by the actions of Fefu and must suck on an ice cube with Bourbon to relax. She practices her French with Cindy in Part 2. Julia (originally played by Margaret Harrington) – her character is set in a wheelchair for the whole play. She became unconscious when a hunter shot a deer that was in the same area she was. She had convulsions and suffered a concussion with a bleeding wound on her forehead. Cindy believes there is no reason for Julia's paralysis since she was never hit by the bullet. Julia does have scar in her brain called petit mal that causes her to blank out. Julia has her own scene in Part 2 of the bedroom where she has mild hallucinations. Her actions display a submissiveness to men. Julia states, \\"If a man commits an evil act, he must be pitied. The evil comes from outside him, through him and into the act. Woman generates the evil herself.\\" Her head also moves as if she has been slapped, which shows Fornés' use of an invisible male character. Julia does not give in to Fefu's control during their confrontation in Part 3, but she dies in the end from an unknown wound. It is revealed that Julia can walk when she chooses to. Emma (originally played by Gordana Rashovich) – a lively character who plays a role in directing the charity skit. She adds humor to the play as well with her antics. In Part 2, she has a conversation with Fefu about genitals and why people act as if genitals are not there. Her character also recites poems in the play. Paula (originally played by Connie LoCurto Cicone) – is introduced in the play by Emma. She is another friend of Fefu's. Her main lines occur during part 2 in the kitchen. She has a conversation with Sue on love affairs and how long they last. Sue exits with a tray of Bourbon ice cubes and Cecilia Johnson enters. At first the conversation is awkward and then it is revealed that the two have an old romantic relationship together. The act ends as Cecilia reaches for Paula's hand. Sue (originally played by Janet Biehl) – another friend of Emma and the other women. She has minor conversations with Julia and Paula and appears as the helpful friend. She tries to give Julia her soup in Part 2 and gives Paula advice in Part 2. Cecilia (originally played by Joan Voukides) – appears at the end of Part 1 as Cecilia Johnson and asks Cindy if she is at the right place for the skit. She had a romantic relationship with Paula and has intimate moments with her throughout the play. She exits the play after the rehearsal is finished.  Analysis  Fefu and Her Friends is recognized as a feminist play for its all-female cast,Hart, Lynda. \\"Making a Spectacle.\\" The University of Michigan Press, 1989, p. 77. central ideas of gender roles, and its bold deviations from conventional stage presentation and audience involvement.Manzanas, Calvo Ana Ma., and Sánchez Jesús. Benito. Narratives of Resistance: Literature and Ethnicity in the United States and the Caribbean. Cuenca: Ediciones De La Universidad De Castilla-La Mancha, 1999, p. 190. Fornés divides the stage into a kitchen, bedroom, study, and lawn, and a short scene in each area is acted out with a fourth of the audience closely viewing each part. The groups of spectators rotate until they have seen all four scenes. These individual scenes highlight conflict in all of the women's lives and thus illustrate a more communal feminist struggle than \\"the typical feminist approach of the early days of the second wave of the movement which emphasized the existence and the rights of the individual woman.\\" Fornés uses the play as representation of the struggle of women against the female stereotype. Any interactions with male characters are done offstage and no established male characters are seen to portray how women behave when not in the presence of men. Jules Aaron wrote of the play, \\"Fefu and Her Friends challenges our preconceptions about life and the theatre through boldly drawn women, temporarily divorced from relationships, trying to sort out the ambiguities of their lives.\\" = Themes and motifs = Kelda Jordan states that Fefu and Her Friends illustrates how most women who struggle to escape the confine of a woman's stereotypical role in society tend to believe that the only way to do so is to control her surroundings and those close to her. Women who step too far outside of the boundaries that society has set for them are considered to be overly aggressive, and take on traits that are generally considered to be those of a man, and the women who possess these traits find that they are perceived as having these traits in excess, simply because the traits are exhibited at all.http://csus- dspace.calstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10211.9/466/FINAL%20THESIS.pdf?sequence=8 According to David Krasner, the themes of loneliness, isolation and entrapment are strongly present in the play. He says that all women have been constrained in life choices to some extent. Fefu is imprisoned in her unhappy marriage, and because she is a woman, she does not possess the power to escape it, and is beginning to slide deeper into depression. Paula was left some time ago by Cecilia, her lover, and Cindy broke up with a man. Julia received emotional trauma when a deer was shot, suffered convulsions, and is now paralyzed. Julia symbolizes how the other women are trapped in their own way.  Production history  The New York Times has described Fefu and Her Friends as a play \\"more often read and studied than seen\\".

Biography Born in Prussia, William Harris was brought to the United States at age six by his father, who opened a clothing store in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Harris attended school for just three months while his family lived in Cleveland; then he worked in cigar manufacturing when the family settled in St. Louis, Missouri. He began his theatre career as a minstrel and blackface comedian in vaudeville, with John Bowman (1866–1873),John Bowman (b. 1842). and with William Carroll (1873–1879).William J. Carroll (1853-1896). Rice, 1911 Around 1880, Harris leased the Howard Athenaeum in Boston, Massachusetts. His success in running the theatre led to a partnership two years later with one of its owners, Isaac B. Rich. Harris later produced plays with Klaw and Erlanger and Charles Frohman, often as a silent partner, and made stars of Andrew Mack, Elsie Ferguson, Rose Stahl, Louis Mann and Clara Lipman. Harris was called the Peter Pan of the theatre business, for his good humor and gift as a storyteller. In April 1913 it was reported that Harris had married young stage actress Florence Quayle. Harris contradicted rumors that they had wed a month before, stating that they had been married for three years. By this time, Harris was considered the dean of American theatrical managers, and one of the most popular people in the profession. Although he had been working toward retirement, he resumed the leadership of his business in 1912 after his elder son, Henry B. Harris, died in the sinking of the .

It was originally produced in Los Angeles in 1980 at the Victory Theater directed by Maria Gobetti. It got a production at the Manhattan Theatre Club off-Broadway in 1984 directed by Stephen Tobolowsky, who was Henley's romantic partner at the time. It moved to a larger off-Broadway house, the Westbank Theater, where it ran for a year. Although not as popular as Henley's Crimes of the Heart, The Miss Firecracker Contest has been generally well received among critics. Set in Brookhaven, Mississippi, the play explores the themes of femininity, beauty, and the need to be accepted.  Plot  = Background = The Miss Firecracker Contest is set in Brookhaven, Mississippi during the midst of Carnelle's attempt to salvage her tarnished reputation as \\"Miss Hot Tamale\\" through entering the Miss Firecracker Contest, the town's annual beauty pageant held on the Fourth of July. Carnelle, who is an orphan, was taken in by her Aunt Ronelle and raised with her two cousins, Elain and Delmount. Aunt Ronelle died of cancer after receiving a pituitary gland transplant from a monkey, causing her entire body to grow long black hairs. Elain won the Miss Firecracker pageant at the young age of 17, compared to Carnelle who pushes the pageant age limit of 24. Elain married well, using her beauty to win a husband after junior college. Delmount was admitted to a mental institution and has been involved in quite a few scandals with exotic beauties who catch his eye. Carnelle recently recovered from syphilis, though not before giving it to the sickly Mac Sam. Carnelle has been attempting to redefine herself by volunteering for the cancer society, attending church, and taking an orphan to dinner every week. She now plans to win the Miss Firecracker Contest to prove to everyone in Brookhaven that she is a valuable and beautiful young woman. =Act 1= The play opens with Carnelle practicing her skit in her living room for the talent section of the pageant. Carnelle is a 24-year-old self-conscious woman with a tarnished reputation. Growing up, Carnelle developed self-esteem issues which caused her to seek the company of many men and eventually contract syphilis. Her past promiscuity earned her the nickname \\"Miss Hot Tamale,\\" and in an effort to dissociate herself from her past Carnelle wants to be crowned Miss Firecracker at the upcoming pageant. Popeye, a 23-year-old quirky seamstress, arrives to take her measurements for the contest. Popeye earned her nickname by accidentally putting ear drops in her eyes as a child which caused them to swell. Popeye herself is quiet, shy, and impressionable, shown when she falls in love with Delmount after only seeing his picture. Carnelle and Elain then discuss the beauty pageant and Carnelle's chances of winning. Elain is Carnelle's beautiful first cousin who previously won the title of Miss Firecracker and has continued to be remembered for her beauty. Encouraged by her mother, Elain went to junior college and capitalized on her beauty to marry a wealthy man and while she appears to have the perfect life, Elain is unhappy and narcissistic. Elain confides in Carnelle that she has left her family. Delmount arrives to an empty living room, and Popeye meets Delmount. Delmount is Carnelle's 28-year-old cousin and Elain's brother. He has a history of violence, and pleaded insanity to avoid a jail sentence after hitting a man in the face with a glass bottle. Elain refused to take custody of him, so Delmount remained in the asylum longer than was originally intended. As a result, Delmount and Elain often butt heads. In addition, Delmount has strange recurring dreams about dismembered and deformed women's body parts, and has a strange obsession with beauty. Delmount explains to Carnelle that Aunt Ronelle's house was left to him and he intends to sell it and all of its contents. Elain and Delmount get into a heated debate about Delmount's criminal history and time in the asylum. Delmount tells Carnelle he intends to give half of the profits made from the house to her, and Carnelle eventually takes to the idea, inspired by the prospect of \\"leaving in a blaze of glory\\" after she wins the pageant. As Delmount sets prices for the items in the living room, he and Elain argue about the past. The two reveal that Carnelle has not received a telephone call yet saying she is a finalist for the pageant. Although Delmount thinks the pageant is ridiculous, he still feels sorry for Carnelle. Elain tells Delmount she is leaving her husband, and Delmount is very happy because he does not like Franklin, though he suspects that Elain is not completely sincere. They discuss their mother, Carnelle's Aunt Ronelle, and her shortcomings as their caregiver. Popeye enters and tells Elain that her \\"heart is hot\\" and that she believes she is in love with Delmount. Elain is surprised to hear this and tells Popeye that Delmount is not sane. The phone rings and Carnelle answers it, finally receiving news that she is a finalist for the pageant. =Act 2= The scene opens in a dressing room at the beauty pageant. Carnelle tells Tessy that she needs Popeye to fix her dress. Tessy is the 23-year-old coordinator of the Miss Firecracker Contest. Her twin sister is a contestant in the pageant, although neither of the women are attractive. Despite this fact, she has a history with Delmount, and flirts with him at the pageant. Mac Sam, Carnelle's 36-year-old ex-lover, is the balloon man at the pageant and visits her in her dressing room. They discuss the fact that Carnelle gave him syphilis and he has not been treated for the disease. In addition to syphilis, Mac Sam has a plethora of other diseases, all of which he refuses to treat medically simply because he has lived longer than he expected without treatment. After Mac Sam leaves, Delmount informs Carnelle that the house auction went well. Carnelle tells Delmount that Popeye has feelings for him, and Delmount becomes agitated. Elain enters with the news that Popeye is missing and thus cannot fix the dress, but she has brought a Mardi Gras mask that Carnelle can use to hide the poor alteration. Carnelle receives a frog suit from Mac Sam and realizes that Popeye is somewhere close by, so Carnelle and Elain leave to find her. Popeye tries to fix the dress in their absence. Mac Sam, Carnelle, and Elain all come back to the dressing room, and Carnelle panics because the dress cannot be fixed without scissors. The others calm her down and then she finishes getting dressed. Mac Sam and Delmount discuss the pageant and their views on beautiful women. Popeye and Elain reveal that Carnelle tripped while wearing the red dress, and consequently the audience began to laugh at her and call her names. Delmount is furious at one man in particular and exits with intent to fight him. Carnelle appears and feels humiliated. Carnelle does not feel confident in her chances of winning. After Carnelle leaves, Delmount and Elain explain that they are reluctant to watch Carnelle humiliate herself further. Elain receives flowers from Franklin and tells Delmount she is returning to her family, which makes Delmount very angry with her. Carnelle reappears, happy because the crowd loved her act. Carnelle then nervously departs for the crowning. Alone, Delmount further criticizes beauty pageants. Mac Sam, Elain, and Popeye come back to the dressing room after Carnelle loses the pageant. Carnelle follows after them and loses her temper with everyone. Tessy informs Carnelle she has to follow the parade carrying a flag, which Carnelle readily does. Elain arrives back in the dressing room slightly drunk. She and Delmount make amends. Elain leaves to have a fling with a man. Popeye and Delmount discuss the future, and Delmount invites Popeye to watch the fireworks with him. The two of them leave before Carnelle arrives once more. Carnelle is surprised when Mac Sam appears next, and explains that in her absence she was by the railroad tracks thinking about her life. Mac Sam says he does not regret the times he spent with her, then departs. Delmount and Popeye climb up a tent to watch the fireworks. Delmount and Popeye invite Carnelle to watch the show with them. While she is climbing up, Delmount kisses Popeye and tells her he loves her. Carnelle reaches the top and explains that she realized that the beauty pageant was not that important after all. The play ends with the three admiring the fireworks.  Relationship with tradition and movements  =Southern literature= This play exemplifies the qualities possessed by Southern literature. The setting, Brookhaven, is a small town in Mississippi. Even the author, Beth Henley, was raised in the South. The themes and focuses of the story incorporate Southern values, such as family and community. Carnelle respects her aunt and uncle, which is clear in the way she reveres the house and does not change the decorating style even after her aunt passes away. The interactions between Carnelle and her cousins further show the importance of family. The community plays a huge role in Southern society, an important fact which is presented in the play through this annual pageant and Carnelle's concern about her reputation. A good reputation, particularly in a small Southern town, is one of the most important possessions one can have. The Miss Firecracker Contest is a symbol for the deep-seated tradition that runs through the town of Brookhaven. This explains why it is so important to Carnelle to regain acceptance through this time-honored event. The dialect used throughout the play is strongly Southern, therefore thoroughly immersing the characters and story in Southern culture. Many critics have also labeled Henley's work as Southern Gothic. Southern Gothic literature includes events in the story that are macabre, grotesque, or fantastic. Carnelle's aunt becoming hairy after receiving an organ transplant, Delmount's dreams, and the way Popeye earned her nickname are just a few examples of events in The Miss Firecracker Contest that exemplify Southern Gothic characteristics. =Pageants= While they do take place all around the nation, pageants are a particularly important event in the South. Pageants truly exemplify all of the qualities one would expect to find in a Southern woman, as well as stress the importance of class and community. Often in Southern pageants, the winner is chosen not because of her own beauty or merit, but simply because of her family connections and social standing in the community. The winner also represents the values of her community. Carnelle does not lose the Miss Firecracker contest because of her looks, she loses because her family and her reputation cannot compete with the reputations of the other contestants.  Themes and motifs  =Identity and meeting cultural expectations= Carnelle struggles to obtain approval from the world and to shake her tarnished reputation as “Miss Hot Tamale,” or as the most promiscuous girl in town. Winning the Miss Firecracker Contest would redeem herself in the eyes of the town before she clears out of Brookhaven, Mississippi. The “ideal woman” she strives to become arrives in the form of her cousin Elain, and this allows for a character contrast to develop, emphasizing Carnelle's determination to “improve” her identity. Carnelle attempts to redefine her personal image by curing her syphilis, joining a church, volunteering for the cancer society, and inviting an orphan to dinner weekly. Trying to win the Miss Firecracker Contest is simply another way to show the town and herself that she amounts to someone special. Henley uses Carnelle to identify the typical struggle females go through to define themselves while maintaining cultural expectations of beauty, poise, and youth. =Beauty= Elain arrives on the scene to contrast Carnelle's floundering self-esteem and to emphasize what advantages beauty has in society. Elain complies with her late mother's wishes to attend junior college and to use her beauty to snag a wealthy husband, demonstrating the power of beauty and how Elain uses her beauty to please her mother. Elain is stuck in an unhappy marriage and is very narcissistic, and these two characteristics demonstrate Henley's point that beauty is not everything. Delmount also has an obsession with beauty, and gets himself into a lot of trouble when exotic beauties catch his eye. This obsession results in disturbingly gruesome dreams about deformed body parts, emphasizing Delmount's madness and excessively romantic mind. Henley demonstrates that while beauty is considered important in society, using it to gain an advantage or admiring it excessively does not ultimately lead to happiness. =The need to be loved= Carnelle never had a stable family life as a child. She was abandoned by her parents and, after her aunt and uncle died, left with no close family. As a result, Carnelle sought love in the form of men, which backfired and ruined her reputation. The Miss Firecracker Contest is Carnelle's last chance to gain acceptance and once again be loved by her community. Elain never had an issue getting love and attention, but she realizes her life is full of fine things yet nothing of any importance. She then tries to leave her husband and family, though in the end, Elain returns to her family because of her need to have a constant sense of security and love. Delmount also desires love, but in a different way than either Carnelle or Elain's desires. He has sexual dreams and fantasies which only serve to confuse him. When he finally falls for Popeye, his quest for love is finally complete.  Critical reception The Miss Firecracker Contest was originally produced in Los Angeles in 1980 and eventually produced on Broadway. Critics, eager to peg The Miss Firecracker Contest as a feminist play that satirizes beauty pageants, were sorely disappointed when Carnelle did not conform to the role of a strong female willing to discard the importance of the beauty pageant, but instead remains loyally intrigued by the concept of beauty and its power in her world. Others recognized this obsession with beauty and denounced the play as antifeminist, but the fact that Carnelle loses the contest and wins some self-confidence downplays the importance of the beauty contest and focuses on personal relationships as being Carnelle's redeeming quality. Beth Henley commented that she never meant to make a statement supporting feminism by including a beauty pageant in her play; instead, the central plot point revolves around wanting to belong to the world in general, a beauty pageant was simply an opportunity for Carnelle to show this world her self-worth. Beth Henley has been consistently praised for her insight into the female mind and for mixing tragedy and comedy so smoothly that her audiences leave feeling optimistic despite the depressing situations in which Henley's characters find themselves. Henley's trademark finale is a scene that offers hope to her central female character through her relationships with other characters, and the audience clearly sees this as Carnelle happily climbs up to the roof to watch the final fireworks. Beth Henley helped make a name for herself with this play by incorporating grotesque Southern humor with female struggles. The focus on the dysfunctional Southern family while producing a positive message about self-confidence, courage, perseverance, and compassion pleased critics, who praised Henley for her quirky characters and warm messages. The play's popularity allowed for the production of Miss Firecracker, the film version of this play, which was produced in 1989 directed by Thomas Schlamme and starring Holly Hunter. Hunter has been cast in many of Henley's plays in addition to The Miss Firecracker Contest.

The play premiered in Czechoslovakia on 27 October 1990, at the J. K. Tyl Theatre in Plzeň. It premiered in the United States on 9 April 1989, at The Public Theater in New York City. In 1989, Temptation was translated to English by the Czech author and journalist Marie Winn. Plot =Background= Temptation takes place at a science institute. The characters, having worked together at the Institute for an unspecified amount of time, are fairly familiar with one another. They have attended office parties together, and exist as a \\"community\\" of scholars tasked with the advancement of scientific (and strictly scientific) knowledge. =Synopsis= Scene 1: the play begins in a room in the Institute. Doctor Foustka, the main character and representation of the Faust character in the play, walks in on his associates, is welcomed and asked about his private studies. Foustka quickly rejects working on private studies, and the other characters smile at one another. The Deputy and Director (the primary antagonist and representation of Satan) walk in, and the Director explains to the group that the Institute, an institute of science, must prevail against the growing cult/fad of black magic. Scene 2: in his apartment, the Doctor uses black magic to call upon a wizard named Fistula, a cripple, and clear representation of Mephistopheles in the play. After a number of odd exchanges, Fistula agrees to help Foustka with his study of black magic in exchange for a testimony that Fistula helped him. Scene 3: at the office party later that night, the wizard demonstrates his powers by making Foustka's love interest, Marketa, fall in love with him and kiss him. Scene 4: Foustka's girlfriend, Vilma, sees this. In her bedroom later that night, Vilma confronts Foustka about his interactions with Marketa. Foustka counters by bringing up the dancer, but they make up. When the dancer drops off flowers for Vilma, Foustka loses it and slaps her to the ground. Scene 5: back in the original room, a replay of the opening scene occurs up until the Director's announcement. He accuses Foustka of betraying the Institute's noble cause of science by studying and even using black magic. Foustka is guaranteed an \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" trial. Scene 6: returning to his study, Foustka again meets Fistula and they argue about the \\"stunt\\" pulled at the party. Fistula diagnoses Foustka with CDS, a syndrome of looking over one's past mistakes. Fistula tells Foustka that Vilma exposed him, among other things, and Foustka seems doubtful. Scene 7: in the original room again, Doctor Foustka's \\"trial\\" begins. Foustka is able to convince everyone that his studies of dark magic were for scientific purposes, and is subsequently celebrated for his brilliance; the group's next party is revealed to be a costume party featuring witches, wizards, etc., planned in order to mock black magic and celebrate Dr. Foustka's research. Scene 8: back in Vilma's bedroom, Foustka accuses Vilma of revealing his activities to the Director, to which Vilma responds with a breakup. Distraught and upset, Foustka attempts to strangle Vilma, but the Dancer arrives and is allowed in. The Dancer comes in and dances with Vilma while Foustka sits helplessly and watches. Scene 9: back in Foustka's apartment, Houbova gives her concerns about Fistula to Foustka, all of which Foustka ignores. Fistula is let in and accuses Foustka of breaking their deal to keep their meetings secret. Foustka, resembling his earlier trial, convinces Fistula that he only revealed their meetings to gain the Director's trust and to further the interests of dark magic. Fistula, content, says that the devil himself wouldn't have tolerated a deal-breaking like that. Scene 10: at the costume party, Foustka repeatedly fails to gain the Director's attention. When he finally does, the Director reveals that he was on to Foustka from the start; he also reveals that Fistula was his accomplice in finding out the truth. He states that you cannot serve two masters for your own interests. As the Director makes his speech, everyone from the institute surrounds Foustka, he is set on fire, smoke covers everything and the play ends. Reviews and critiques Reviews of the play and its elements have been mixed among critics. The repetition seen throughout Temptation, which is meant to mesmerize the audience and heighten the suspense of the play, has been described as both \\"meaningful\\" and \\"deadening because no new insights are revealed.\\" Performances of Fistula have been praised, his character being described as \\"terrifyingly mysterious\\" and \\"quirky, outlandish and completely riveting.\\" Walter Brandes has been praised for his performance of Doctor Foustka, as he \\"navigates the character's precarious duplicity with expertise\\" and endures the character's long-winded presence on stage. Themes and motifs =Totalitarianism= Havel believed in the importance of allowing experience to dictate one’s approach to politics, society, and even morality. His approach to diplomacy inspired many schools of thought that are still prominent today. The programmatic style of government seen in Temptation discouraged the influence of personal experience leading to enslavement. Havel relied on \\"a ceaseless process of searching, demystification and penetration beneath the surface of phenomena.\\" Havel suggested that an open-ended, constant journey for enlightenment was a better philosophy than simply accepting a system that enforced a thought. =Power and politics= Havel also believed in the initial good intentions of all politicians. Havel saw the concepts of politics and morality as inseparable, and trying to handle each one individually as a travesty. Havel was very popular among ordinary Americans for his idea of an inherent connection between religion and politics. He believed that good men are often corrupted by the trappings of power and eventually stray from their original goals of pursuing the common good. Havel also believed that people entered politics for one of three reasons. The first reason was that one perceived a better way of doing things. The second reason is the natural search for self-affirmation in human beings. The third reason is the obvious benefits that come along with being a political figure. Foustka is a prime model of Havel’s principles in action. Throughout Temptation, Foustka is caught between self-preservation and personal benefit. Foustka is obviously interested in the benefits of the employment of ritual, but winds up getting caught trying to play both sides. =Faust legend= The Faust legend had a significant impact on Havel before he began writing Temptation. While in prison in May 1977, a copy of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust was delivered to his cell, followed by Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus, neither of which were requested. Of the time period, Vaclav himself said he \\"felt as though [he] were being, in a very physical way, tempted by the devil. Havel wrote Temptation over ten nights one autumn at his farmhouse, Hrádeček. When he finished the play he was \\"physically and psychically drained\\". He fell down the stairs, he developed a fever, and stayed in bed with chills in a situation without medicine or food because he was snowed in. Upon returning to Prague, Havel \\"said that he had slipped away from the devil by the skin of his teeth\\". The plot of Temptation is inspired heavily by the Faust legend—a man who sells his soul to the devil. Unlike the original Faust myths, Temptation's interpretation of the Mephistopheles (Devil) character, Fistula, is not a classically demonic figure; he is a small person who \\"gives off a distinctly unsavory impression.\\" Fistula compounds the ambiguity of his character by stating to Foustka that \\"[Foustka doesn't] know if I'm a devil or only pretending to be... I might be, and then again I might not be.\\" Fistula strays farther from the Mephistopheles archetype by downplaying his role as tempter, offering Foustka the psychological explanation that Foustka only demonizes Fistula \\"to rid [himself, Foustka] of responsibility—and to ease [his] conscience.\\" This modern approach to the character is also more personal and psychological than traditionally spiritual, as Faust expert Lorna Fitzsimmons even states that Havel uses Fistula to imply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle when he states that \\"the truth isn't merely what we believe, after all, but also why and to whom and under what circumstances we say it.\\" See also * Deal with the Devil * Faust * Works based on Faust References =Sources= * Category:1985 plays Category:Plays by Václav Havel Category:Works based on the Faust legend ","title":"Temptation (play)"},{"id":"34579497","text":"Willard's sooty boubou (Laniarius willardi) is a species of bird in the family Malaconotidae.

It is a volcanic field that takes the form of a large cinder cone field, with numerous shield volcanoes and maars. The volcanic field is best known for the 18th- century eruption of Jorullo volcano, and 20th-century eruption of Parícutin volcano. Morphology The Michoacán–Guanajuato volcanic field covers an area of x , in the states of Michoacán and Guanajuato. It contains 1400 vents, mostly cinder cones. The shield volcanoes are mostly Pleistocene in age. The cinder cones are randomly arranged and occur at low altitudes, usually, on alluvial plains or on the flanks of eroded shield volcanoes. There are an average of 2.5 cinder cones every 2. Eruptions =El Jorullo — 1759−1774= Drawing of El Jorullo El Jorullo volcano began on September 29, 1759. Earthquakes occurred prior to this first day of the eruption. Once the cinder cone started erupting, it continued for 15 years, eventually stopping in 1774. El Jorullo destroyed what had been a rich agricultural area. It grew approximately 820 feet (250 meters) from the ground in the first six weeks. The eruptions from El Jorullo were primarily phreatic and phreatomagmatic. They covered the area with sticky mudflows, water flows, and ash falls. All but the youngest lava flows were covered by this ashfall. Later eruptions from El Jorullo were magmatic with neither mud nor water flows. This 15-year eruption was the longest one El Jorullo has had and was the longest cinder cone eruption known. Lava flows can still be seen to the north and west of the cinder cone. The eruption had a VEI of 4. Its current elevation is 1,320 meters (4,331 ft), and its crater is about 1,300 by 1,640 feet (400 by 500 meters) wide and 490 feet (150 meters) deep. El Jorullo has four smaller cinder cones which have grown from its flanks. The vents of El Jorullo are aligned in a northeast to southwest direction. Lava from these vents cover nine km2 around the volcano. Later eruptions produced lavas that had higher silica contents making them more viscous than the earlier basalts and basaltic andesite lavas. =El Parícutin — 1943−1952= The Parícutin volcano began as a fissure in a cornfield owned by a Purépecha farmer, Dionisio Pulido, on February 20, 1943. Pulido, his wife, and their son all witnessed the initial eruption of ash and stones first-hand as they ploughed the field. El Parícutin grew quickly, reaching five stories tall in just a week, and it could be seen from afar in a month. Much of the volcano's growth occurred during its first year, while it was still in the explosive pyroclastic phase. The nearby villages of Paricutín (after which the volcano was named) and San Juan Parangaricutiro were both buried in lava and ash;. The residents relocated to nearby lands. At the end of the first phase, after roughly one year, the cinder cone had grown tall. For the next eight years El Parícutin would continue erupting, although this was dominated by relatively quiet eruptions of lava that would scorch the surrounding of land. The cinder cone's activity would slowly decline during this period until the last six months of the eruption, during which violent and explosive activity was frequent. In 1952 the eruption ended and Parícutin went quiet, attaining a final height of from the cornfield where it began. Like most cinder cones, Parícutin is believed to be a monogenetic volcano, which means that once it has finished erupting, it will never erupt again. Any new eruptions in the Michoacan-Guanajuato volcanic field will erupt in a new location. Three people died as a result of lightning strikes caused by the eruptions, but no deaths were attributed to the lava or asphyxiation.

During his career spanning from 1879 to 1909, he served as a police informer, agent provocateur, officer and the Head of Okhrana foreign service based in Paris. Born to a Jewish family, he was later baptised and at the end of his career was awarded the rank of Actual State Councilor, which gave him the rights of nobility.  Early life  Arкadiy Harting was born Aharon Hackelman () 29 October 1861 in Pinsk (now Belarus), to a Jewish family. In 1879 he became a student in Saint Petersburg.  Police Informer in Russia  In Saint Petersburg Hackelman joined the underground cell of a revolutionary terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya and befriended many revolutionaries, including Vladimir Burtsev, future counter-intelligence champion of the Russian revolutionaries. At about the same time, Hackelman was recruited by Okhrana to spy on activities of fellow revolutionaries. Information obtained from him led to a number of arrests, and some fellow revolutionaries became suspicious. According to the archive of the Paris Okhrana., he was defended by Burtsev, but Burtsev claims that he was prevented from raising his suspicions about Hackelman by other high-level revolutionaries. Hackelman then moved to Riga where he continued to spy on members of Narodnaya Volya, leading to further arrests. When suspicions about his involvement with Okhrana intensified, he fled abroad.  Agent of Paris Okhrana  Hackelman then settled in Switzerland and enrolled in ETH Zürich under an assumed name Landesen. Under this name he resumed his contacts with Russian revolutionaries who were preparing bombs to be sent to Russia. In 1885, he was recruited by Paris Okhrana, Okhrana's foregin service based in Paris under its first head Peter Rachkovsky. Landesen first spied on revolutionaries in Switzerland despite persistent suspicions of cooperation with the police. In 1890 he moved to Paris and continued to spy on Russian revolutionaries based in France. The most high profile operation of Landesen in Paris was an elaborate provocation to expose a number of revolutionary terrorists. He facilitated and financed a fake conspiracy of a number of revolutionaries to assassinate Russian Emperor Alexander III. To this end, a number of bombs were prepared and distributed among the conspirators. Rachkovsky then tipped off the Sûreté, the French secret police, and conspirators were arrested, but Landesen escaped. In a widely publicised trial of 1890, the conspirators were sentenced to prison terms or expelled from France. Landesen, considered the ring leader, was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison. This operation served not only the primary task of neutralising the radical revolutionaries, but also to show to the Russian government that France was no longer soft on subversives. This facilitated the Franco-Russian Alliance, which was Rachkovsky's major of diplomatic goal.  Belgium and Germany  Hackelman then fled to Belgium, where he assumed a new name, Arkadiy Harting. Rachkovsky assigned Harting to a number of missions concerned with security of visiting Russian dignitaries. For these assignments, he was decorated by Honours from Russia and a number of host countries. In 1892–1893 he was baptised and assumed the name Arkadiy Mikhailovich. In 1896 he officially changed his surname to Harding (Гартинг). He then married a Belgian Magdalena Pirlot. In 1900, he was appointed head of Okhrana Berlin station, which initially operated as a branch of the Paris Okhrana under Rachkovsky, but more independently after 1902, when Rachkovsky was replaced by a new chief, Leonid Rataev. In Berlin Harting organised a surveillance and penetration network similar to that operated by Rachkovsky in Paris. One of his agents was Jacob Zhitomirsky, who provided valuable information on the activities of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and its Bolshevik faction, including the inner circle of Russia's future communist leader, Vladimir Lenin. Zhitormirsky's information led to the arrest of Kamo by the German Police for his role in the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery. In 1904, during Russo-Japanese War, Harting was sent on an assignment not directly related to revolutionary activities. He was to organise a surveillance of possible Japanese spies in the Baltic, in order to prevent disruptions to the navigation of Russian fleet to the Pacific.  Chief of Paris Okhrana  After the assassination of Interior Minister Vyacheslav von Plehve and the escalation of revolutionary activity in 1905, Rachkovsky was brought back into Okhrana as a deputy head of the Police Department, and soon after arranged to have Rataev replaced with Harting as chief of Paris Okhrana. Under Harting, Paris Okhrana reached the peak of its activity. Harting's operations were particularly effective against arms smuggling into Russia by revolutionary groups. Harting coordinated surveillance and penetration of these groups throughout Europe, and introduced the filing system with information about all persons mentioned in intelligence and operational reports. He coordinated a network of about 40 penetration agents and about 20 external surveillance agents.  Exposure  In 1909 a former Okhrana officer Leonid Menshchikov, who defected to revolutionaries, identified Harting as a former Okrana agent Hackelman and as Landesen, the organiser of the provocation for which he had been sentenced to a prison term by a French court. When Burtsev published this information, Harting was dismissed from his Okrana post and fled to Belgium. The revelation caused a scandal in French Parliament, when Socialist deputy Jean Jaurès attacked the French government for hosting foreign police service on French soil. In response, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau promised that this would not be allowed to continue. Although in reality Paris Okhrana continued operate under a new chief, Alexandr Krasilnikov, it never reached the level of activity achieved under Harting. In 1913 Harting was awarded the rank of Actual State Councilor, which gave him the rights of hereditary nobility. During World War I Harting was involved in counter-intelligence work in France and Belgium. His further whereabouts are unknown.

It is published in print and online.  History  The White Review was founded by editors Benjamin Eastham and Jacques Testard, and released its first issue in print in February 2011. The quarterly print edition was originally designed Ray O'Meara, and carries poetry, short fiction, essays and interviews alongside photography and art. Since 2013 and 2017 The White Review has administered the influential The White Review Short Story and Poetry Prize respectively. The White Review website is frequently updated with new web-only content and excerpts from the print edition. The website, like the print edition, carries essays, interviews, poetry and fiction. In an interview with Creative Review, the founding editors stated that The White Review was intended as \\"a space for a new generation to express itself unconstrained by form, subject or genre\\". Talking to US-based magazine Bookforum, they explained that they were inspired to establish a British-based equivalent to publications including n+1, Guernica, Cabinet, the Paris Review and Bomb, while an early interview with It's Nice That quoted them as saying that the magazine would endeavour to \\"stay close to new writing and emerging art\\". After 20 print issues, The White Review's print iteration and website were redesigned, and a new editorial team, led by Francesca Wade and Željka Marošević, was introduced. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, and in response to the paucity of space for arts and literature criticism in U.K publications, The White Review began publishing book and art show reviews on its website in 2017.  Interviews  Each issue of the journal includes long- form interviews with writers and artists. Notable interview subjects have included Annie Ernaux, Margo Jefferson, Jenny Offill, Claudia Rankine, Elmgreen and Dragset, George Saunders, Michael Hardt, Tom McCarthy, Paula Rego, Hari Kunzru, André Schiffrin, Will Self, Marina Warner, Chris Kraus, Sophie Calle, Deborah Levy, Rachel Cusk, and Richard Wentworth. The website has also carried interviews with David Graeber, Jonathan Safran Foer, DBC Pierre, Cornelia Parker, Wayne Koestenbaum, and others.  Contributors  Notable contributors have included Ned Beauman, Joshua Cohen, John Ashbery, Chris Kraus, Lee Rourke, Anne Carson, Sally Rooney, Hatty Nestor, Leslie Jamison, China Miéville, Alice Oswald, Dorothea Lasky, Adam Thirlwell, and Laszlo Krasznahorkai.  The White Review Prizes  In 2013, The White Review Short Story Prize was launched to find and foster new British and Irish writing talent. It is an annual short story competition for emerging writers who \\"explore and expand the possibilities of the short story form ... the prize was founded to reward ambitious, imaginative and innovative approaches to creative writing.\\" The prize is supported by Jerwood Foundation and awards £2500 to the best piece of short fiction by a writer resident in the UK and Ireland who has yet to secure a publishing deal. The winner will also be published in a print issue of The White Review. Many winners and shortlisted writers have since published novels and become acclaimed. The White Review Poet's Prize was introduced in 2017, and was launched to recognise and celebrate English-language poets who are at the crucial stage of creating their debut pamphlet or collection, and to encourage poetry that explores and expands the possibilities of the page-poetry form. =2013= The 2013 inaugural prize was awarded April 25, 2013.

Background Kincaid's father was an early pioneer of railways, as a promoter of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, and the Midland Great Western Railway. On account of delicate health, Joseph’s early tuition was private, but he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1852, graduating in Arts in 1857, and subsequently obtaining a Master's degree. Career On leaving college he obtained practical experience as assistant engineer on the Kingstown harbour works ; in the construction of the harbour at Mullaghmore, County Sligo, as Engineer-in-charge. From 1860 to 1863, he served under Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet and Charles Blacker Vignoles, and was engaged at home and in Spain on the construction of the Tudela and Bilbao Railway and other undertakings. He also carried out the lighting of Bilbao and Logroño with oil-gas. His name is identified with the introduction and development of tramways in Great Britain and Ireland; his first was a horse- tramway from Dublin to Black Rock. These early tramways were constructed with a shallow rail spiked to longitudinal wood sleepers, but Kincaid recognized the defects of this and introduced a metallic system, which became known by his name, consisting of channel shaped rails fixed on cast-iron chairs embedded in concrete. This system was used for a number of years until displaced by the girder type of tramway rail. Kincaid was amongst the first to introduce mechanical propulsion on tramways ; steam-locomotives, cable- traction, and then electric traction. He was responsible for the first cable- tramway constructed in England, the Highgate Hill Cable Tramway. In 1892 he associated with himself as partners, Mr. J. E. Waller and Edward Manville, and subsequently Philip Dawson joined the firm, which practised as Kincaid, Waller, Manville and Dawson. He was elected an Associate of The Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 April 1870 and was transferred to the class of Members on 25 March 1879.Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers, Volume 171, Issue 1908 References Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:1834 births Category:1907 deaths ","title":"Joseph Kincaid"},{"id":"34579708","text":"Wissam Constantin, is the first deaf professional player in the Lebanese Basketball League 1.92 m tall (6 ft 4 in) and 85 kg weight (187 lbs).

It is operated by RSRTC. The system has been running from many years, but was heavily modified in 2007. RSRTC extended travelling facility to the colonies and sub-urban towns in and around Jaipur. Regardless of the heavy financial loss on the system, RSRTC has been operating about 300 city buses per day. For late night passengers, selected city night service buses connecting to the local railway station and the Bus Stand have also been operated by RSRTC. Recently it also inaugurated its HOP-ON HOP-OFF service for attracting foreign tourists.http://www.jaipurbus.com/TouristBus.pdf The process of development and expansion of the system to the commuters is a regular process in RSRTC and RSRTC is expediting its responsibility. For declaring its public responsibility, Jaipur City Transport Services has been published for better transparency and accountability. History City bus service was introduced in 2007. Initially, 100 buses were used. The new city bus was very well received by the local populace, and it became very popular. In 2009, a new fleet of low floor and low floor AC buses were introduced. It is run under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Bus service was initially only on the main roads, but it later operated in residential areas too. Now it also operates in congested areas. JCTSL was established to cater the increasing needs of Jaipur City.RSRTC covered travelling facility to the colonies, urban, sub-urban town, historical places, and tourist places and around Jaipur. Organization RSTRC Non-AC Bus in Bharatpur JCTSL is headquartered at Jaipur and has 15 primary routes. It has 4 depots: Sanganer, Vidhyadhar Nagar, Shastri Nagar, and Bais Godam. Jaipur City Transport Services employs 650 employees.[1] Fleet A bus stop of Jaipur BRTS It has a fleet of 400 buses. JCTSL and RSRTC Jaipur runs city bus service. Of them, 20 are A/C Low floor, 380 are non A/C Low floor. At present there are 7 radial routes with 7 additional routes, 3 circular routes,3 AC routes and 6 sub-urban routes. Buses in green colour are for suburban and rural services in and around Jaipur city.http://www.jaipurbus.com/bus_stops_list.htm =Low floor bus service= Jaipur city transport services limited operates a large number of A/C and non A/C low floor buses under the title RSRTC JNNURM. The type of bus can be judged on their colour. The A/C buses are in dark red, while the routes have their own colors. These buses are well designed and equipped with all needed security measures, though security measures are rarely followed by commuters. These buses can be used by the physically disabled. Modern automatic door opening/closing function is there in this buses. =Suburban bus service= Jaipur city transport services limited operates buses for suburban towns around Jaipur. These buses are green in color and have limited stops as compared to City buses. They have fixed fares and are very good source of transportation for neighboring towns around Jaipur. =Mini bus service= The Jaipur City Transport Services Limited (JCTSL) operates a fleet of low-floor buses in the Walled city area in December. These have replaced the old big buses which the traffic police had declared unsuitable for commute in the congested area. These buses run on two-three routes covering majority of the Walled City area. The places which were not connected with the bus service in the past, is covered by the new fleet. These buses will have a capacity to accommodate 30 passengers which can go up to a maximum of 35. The buses are also going to provide a relief to the traffic police which has been facing a tough time in managing the vehicular movement at peak hours. \\"Driving during peak hours has become a time-consuming task. It is a good move to replace the big low-floor buses,\\" said Devendra Jain, a shopkeeper in the Walled City area. Passenger amenities To solve the transportation problems of Jaipur, new buses were introduced recently by JCTSL. Millions of passengers with a view to facilitate the city (JCTSL) take the floor on Thursday, 10 bus routes \\"Jaipur just\\" the pilot began. Proposed plans The BQS are an integral part of the overall transportation plan. All JCTSL buses running on any of the routes will stop only at the BQS. The BQS is designed so as to facilitate boarding and disembarking from the special JnNURM buses. The BQS is also expected to act as information centres for passengers, tourists and others and have been specially designed for high density areas at the points of easy accessibility. Each BQS is expected to have a small kiosk as well as an ATM counter. Since it is prominently located on the roadside, well lit in the evenings, the BQS will also serve as one of the best advertisement platforms for visual advertising in Jaipur city. As a policy measure too, the governments are increasingly adopting advertisement by-laws which clearly indicate that advertisement on roads have to be in/near the public transport facilities. Apart from the utility, the BQS are also expected to be, visually, very attractive.

Wretched's musical style incorporates elements of melodic death metal, deathcore, and technical death metal. History Wretched started in 2005 under the name And Since Forgotten as a collaboration between Marshall Wieczorek, Paul McClendon, and Steven Funderburk, who started playing together and looking for new members to start a music group. They recruited JC Lawrence and Josh Simpson and started playing local shows in North Carolina, quickly gaining a local following. They were noticed by Victory Records and were offered a contract in 2008, writing their first record, The Exodus Of Autonomy. The first album released with Victory Records got them nationwide recognition. The Exodus Of Autonomy was released in 2009, selling 7,100 units to date according to Nielsen Soundscan. The band hit the road to support the record with most of the shows played with local bands. Guitarist Joel Moore was replaced by John Vail, and bassist David Briggs was replaced by Rico Marziali soon after Beyond the Gate was recorded and released. Beyond the Gate gathered positive reviews, and a special website (wretchedthrash.com) was created that featured short stories for every song on the album. So far, two pieces have been featured, but with the vocalist change in 2011, there is very little chance work will be completed. Currently, wretchedthrash.com redirects to an election news website. Along with the new vocalist, the band replaced Rico Marziali with Andrew Grevey as the bass player, and they have toured with The Browning, Serpents and Impending Doom to support Beyond The Gate. On March 15, 2012, they began The Metal Alliance Tour, performing with DevilDriver, The Faceless, 3 Inches of Blood and Dying Fetus. The tour was in direct support of the new album, which was recorded in February 2012. It was the first record to feature Adam Cody, of the death metal/grindcore act Columns and of Glass Casket as the new vocalist. On March 1 on YouTube, the band premiered the first single from Son of Perdition, entitled \\"Repeat... The End Is Near\\". The video shows both guitarists Steven and John playing the song along with guitar tabs being presented on the side, encouraging the guitar playing community to submit guitar covers of the song. Son of Perdition was released on March 29, and it scanned 836 copies in its opening weekend. The album got positive reviews, and the band released \\"Dilated Disappointment\\" as the single, with an accompanying music video. Wretched was going on tour with King Conquer, followed by a 3 Inches of Blood tour later this summer. John Vail was replaced by his predecessor Joel Moore. Their fourth studio album Cannibal was released June 10, 2014 through Victory Records. The album stream premiered exclusively with Decibel Magazine on June 9. The album was met with extremely positive reviews. Paulo Maniaco from Metal Temple labelled Cannibal a \\"masterpiece\\", giving the album a perfect 10/10, stating: > WRETCHED have managed to give us an awesome album, Death Metal at its best, > but still with a different edge. I could experiment touches of Thrash Metal > and a bit of Black and Gothic as well. More or less a mix of HAVOK, > KATAKLYSM, CANNIBAL CORPSE, EXODUS, and DISSECTION, all mixed in a blender > and served on golden plates, an excellent work. Wretched performed at the 2014 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival for the entirety of the tour, playing on the Victory Records stage. Beginning November 26, 2014 Wretched will be touring the entire United States with Battlecross and War of Ages.

Early life Born in 1918 in Cardiff, Wales, the son of Eli and Molly Reuben, practising Orthodox Jews of Latvian origin, Harold was the eldest of four siblings, all of whom were musical. By the age of 10, he was winning piano prizes and performing with, for example, the Scottish Symphony Orchestra under George Szell. At the age of seven having, according to his sister Bernice Rubens, \\"exhausted all the local teachers\\", Harold began travelling to London to study with Madame Maria Levinskaya. Bernice, a Booker Prize-winning novelist, would use his study with Madame Levinskaya as the subject of her book, Madame Sousatzka, which subsequently became a film with Shirley MacLaine in the title role. Rubens' performing skills were diminished by illness, after which he concentrated on teaching. Later life After a stay in the US, Rubens moved to South Africa in the 1950s and become involved in the anti-apartheid movement. While teaching at the South African College of Music in Cape Town, he was the first musician to refuse to play to segregated audiences; during the ANC Treason Trial (1956–1961) he played high-profile concerts to raise money for ANC defendants; and his home in Newlands became a meeting place for other movement members, including Nelson Mandela and Albie Sachs, who recalled: Rubens returned from South Africa to the UK in 1963, taking up a position teaching at the Royal Academy of Music, London. He died in 2010, at his home in London.

It is designed to meet the LMP1 regulations of 2012, and act as a successor to the Pescarolo 01, with the design including a Mandatory Shark-Fin, alongside with air extractor holes located in the wheel arches. The car was built around the carbon tub of the abandoned Aston Martin AMR-One LMP1 design, which had competed in the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car made its debut at the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Development  It was announced on ahead of the 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship, that Henri Pescarolo had acquired 2 new Aston Martin AMR-One chassis, with the intent of using the car's carbon fibre tub as the basis of his new design, the Pescarolo 03. The car would replace the aging Pescarolo 01 chassis which was nearly 5 years old. It was later announced that the car would be a joint collaboration between Luxury Racing and Pescarolo Team.

His most famous song is probably The Newcassel Worthies.  William's life  William Armstrong was born c1804 in Painter Heugh (or Hugh), (which was an old lane dating from medieval Newcastle, a lane joining lower part of Dean Street to the higher part of Pilgrim Street), the name possibly derived from the fact that ships tied up here in the tidal parts of the Lort Burn (now filled). His father was a shoemaker owning a business in Dean Street. William himself was apprenticed to a Mr Wardle, a painter of White Cross (the site of a previous market cross dating from 400–500 years previous) in Newgate Street. After his apprenticeship he worked as a journeyman. (It is not known whether he actual achieved the degree of \\"master\\" in his trade). He was admired as the singer \\"Willie Armstrong\\" as well as being appreciated as a songwriter, and was known as a performer who enjoyed singing his own songs. He moved to London c1833-34 after which, very little is known of him or his life.  Works  Many of his songs were of the times, of the Colliers and the Keelboatmen, or humorous occurrences.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Description Bruegel shows Paul's army on its way to Damascus in contemporary dress and with 16th century armour and weapons. The saint himself is in a blue doublet and hose of the painter's day. Bruegel, having lived in Italy, was not unfamiliar with classical dress: his intention in representing biblical scenes in contemporary dress was to stress their relevance to his own time. In view of the persecution and counter-persecution of the Reformation and Counter- Reformation, the story of Paul's conversion had special significance.See Grove Art Online The events are described in The Acts of the Apostles 9, 3-7: Bruegel is not only illustrating the biblical text; he is also stressing the need for faith and condemning the sin of pride.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, Skira, Milano 2003. =Details= Detail from right composition Detail from central composition showing Paul lying on the ground next to his horse This work was acquired by Archduke Ernest of Austria in 1594, subsequently passing into the imperial collections with Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. Some critics have suggested that the scene depicted by Bruegel refers to contemporaneous events, especially the crossing of the Alps by Don Fernando Álvarez de Toledo y Pimentel, 3rd Duke of Alba in 1567, as he was marching into the Netherlands at the head of an army of 10,000 men to sedate the Dutch revolts.See Wiki entry on the Duke of Alba and the Netherlands. More probably, Bruegel's depiction of Paul's conversion taking place high up on a pine-clad mountain pass may have been suggested by an engraving of 1509 by Lucas van Leyden.Compare the engraving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and at thirdmill.org. As in The Procession to CalvarySee The Procession to Calvary image at Wikimedia Commons. and the Preaching of John the Baptist, Bruegel places the principal figures in the middle distance, almost lost amongst a mass of small figures and behind the eye-catching foreground soldiers and horsemen, who are incidental to the telling of the story. This is a familiar mannerist device which is intended to tease the spectator and draw his eye deep into the picture space in search of the principal subject.

The songwriting credits are attributed to Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney.Paul McCartney: Chord Songbook Collection p. 1956 Background Like the Red Rose Speedway tracks \\"Get On the Right Thing\\" and \\"Little Lamb Dragonfly\\", \\"Big Barn Bed\\" was a leftover from the McCartneys' solo career. The song dates back to 1971, with the opening lines of the track constituting the coda to the \\"Ram On\\" reprise on the McCartneys' album Ram. However, during the recording sessions for Red Rose Speedway, the song was recorded by the band for the new album. \\"Big Barn Bed\\" was originally intended to be the opening track of the double-LP version of Red Rose Speedway, but although the final album was cut down to a single disc, the song remained the album's opener. A live version of \\"Big Barn Bed\\" was also included as the opening track in the James Paul McCartney television special, broadcast on 10 May 1973. Throughout the performance of the song, a brief description of each member of the band was displayed on screen.McCartney Solo: See You Next Time p. 41 Lyrics and music According to music professor Vincent Benitez, \\"Big Barn Bed\\" has a freer structure than most of Paul McCartney's songs. He finds the lyrics to seem more like the words were just \\"strung together\\" rather than formed into a coherent whole. The lyrics involve big barn beds and leaping armadillos. The song is in the key of F major. Reception In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye described the track as \\"captur[ing] McCartney's current approach as well as any\\", saying, \\"Neither verse nor chorus are anything much, but the song draws you slowly in with the same steady roll of traction demonstrated by that odd union of records which score heavily in the discotheque markets, reaching its peak with the endless repetitions of the chorus line in the end.\\" AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine includes \\"Big Barn Bed\\" among \\"the greatest songs\\" on Red Rose Speedway, but labels the track as \\"slight\\". Guitar World contributor Damien Faneilli rated it as one of McCartney's 15 best \\"under-the-radar\\" post- Beatle songs, praising its simplicity, harmonies, acoustic guitars and \\"weird but fun lyrics\\". Author John Blaney considered \\"Big Barn Bed\\" to be \\"little more than an underdeveloped fragment that went nowhere\\".

She received a bachelor's degree in 1903 and later received a Doctor of Science degree in 1930. Throughout her career, she taught at colleges as well as performing important research in the field of industrial psychology. She subjected herself to her own trials in her research on fatigue. She worked alongside other researchers to find the effects of alcohol and opium on efficiency as well as research on telegraphist's cramp. She was an investigator at the Industrial Health Research Board from 1920 to 1944. She held several positions on the executive of the British Psychological Society. Early life and education Born in Hulme, Manchester, on 29 August 1879, May Smith was the elder daughter of an iron turner. She attended Owens College on an education scholarship, studying philosophy and some psychology. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and an external diploma in education from the University of London in 1903. After graduating, she taught school in Manchester for two years. In 1905 May Smith began teaching educational psychology at Cherwell Hall, a training school for secondary school teachers in Oxford. She intended to study for a Master of Arts degree in philosophy from the University of Manchester while working full-time. However, after attending lectures by the psychologist William McDougall, she decided to become his student and research assistant. While continuing to teach at Cherwell Hall, she became part of a group of McDougall's students, including William Brown, Cyril Burt, and J. C. Flugel, who were interested in experimental psychology. London University awarded May Smith a Doctor of Science degree in 1930. Research = Study of fatigue = Having been trained in experimental methods by McDougall, Smith developed and carried out a major study on the effects of fatigue. Using herself as the sole research subject, she restricted herself to only 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 hours of sleep on successive nights, using a variety of tests to evaluate the consequences. These included serial word recall, the capacity to learn nonsense syllables, and performance on several physical tasks. She carried on the experiment for three years, averaging five days a week. May Smith published her findings in the British Journal of Psychology in 1916. She found that there was a brief period immediately after the initial sleep deprivation in which the subject's performance was improved, but that this was followed by a long period in which performance was diminished, and that recovery was slow. She also noted that the fatigued subject's ability to judge her own effectiveness was impaired, \\"extremely bad work being not infrequently accompanied by a conviction that it is unusually good\\". She concludes that the ideal amount of time necessary to complete work most efficiently and effectively differs between every individual and type of work. = Effects of alcohol and opium on efficiency = Among other research projects, Smith worked with McDougall on studying the effects of alcohol and opium on efficiency. This experience led to her being hired to interview incarcerated prostitutes to determine whether or not \\"drink had contributed largely to their choice of occupation\\", a hypothesis that was not supported by her findings. = Telegraphist's cramp = One of her most important contributions began with a study, in collaboration with Culpin and Eric Farmer, of a condition called \\"telegraphist's cramp\\", a type of focal dystonia of the hand which had been thought to be caused by physical fatigue. Their research found evidence of a neurotic component in the condition. It was the basis for further research by Smith and Culpin into psychological factors in other occupational diseases, resulting in 1930 in a \\"landmark\\" report entitled The Nervous Temperament. This work was notable both for its results and for its experimental design, which combined interview-based clinical assessments and objective tests. Demonstrating a positive correlation between Culpin's clinical assessments and Smith's test results, the study provided evidence that psychoneurosis is one of the factors responsible for industrial illness. Moreover, it enhanced the legitimacy of clinical psychology, which was a relatively new discipline. Career = Industrial research = In 1920, Smith was hired as an investigator by the Industrial Fatigue Research Board, a government agency which became the Industrial Health Research Board in 1928. From the late 1920s, her office was at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where she collaborated closely with the epidemiologist and statistician Major Greenwood and the medical psychologist Millais Culpin. Smith and Culpin, while part of the IFRB, studied the health of WW1 munitions workers via use of a device known as a Dotting Machine, which was made by Edgar Schuster. She was also a part-time researcher for the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, an industry-funded organization that sought to use psychological techniques for vocational guidance and employee selection. Her book, An Introduction to Industrial Psychology, was published in 1943. She retired from the Industrial Health Research Board in 1944. = Teaching career = Smith taught educational psychology at Cherwell Hall, a training college for secondary teachers. During World War II she taught at both the London School of Hygiene and at Birkbeck College. During this time some of the worst air raids that occurred in London and for her works she was awarded the O.B.E. in 1945. Smith had no interest in children; although she had done some teaching she said she couldn't understand them and that for her \\"people began at eighteen\\". Although she felt this way, students discovered that she accepted them and as a result, she spoke of the surprise of some Polish students, arriving one morning when the School of Hygiene had been rather badly damaged by blast in the previous night's raid, at finding that staff and students themselves swept away the broken glass and then got on with lectures  Publications  = \\"An Autobiography\\" = May Smith wrote, \\"An Autobiography\\" in 1949. It was published in the journal Occupational Psychology. = \\"A Contribution to the Study of Fatigue\\" = \\"A contribution to the study of fatigue\\" was published in 1916 in the British Journal of Psychology where she found that fatigue involves two distinct phases. In the first phase, fatigue acts as a stimulant which allows work that demands concentrated attention is more effective. In the second phase, the mind loses its ability to concentrate, retain information and becomes overall, inefficient. Smith also found that following fatigue, the recovery to a normal condition was slow and delayed. = An Introduction to Industrial Psychology = \\"An Introduction to Industrial Psychology\\" was published in 1943. Smith intended for the book to provide insight for people who were either responsible for others, or had to work with others in the industrial field. She discussed fatigue in Industry and the sources behind that fatigue. Smith proves guidance for training and job selection, as well as how to deal with incidents that occur in the industry. = \\"Effects of Alcohol and some other Drugs during Normal and Fatigued Conditions\\" = May Smith wrote this with William McDougall at the request of the Central Control Board for Liquor Traffic. In their work, they discuss mental effects of alcohol as well as chloroform, strychnine, tea, opium and potassium bromide on the fatigued state and normal state. Later life May Smith continued to teach part-time at Birkbeck College until 1955. After her retirement from the Industrial Health Research Board, May Smith held several positions on the executive of the British Psychological Society, of which she had been a member since 1914. In 1945, she was appointed to the Order of the British Empire. She was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Psychological Society in 1958. May Smith died in London on 21 February 1968.

The installation can be made in or above the ground for either temporary or permanent applications. There are two types of wheel washing systems: roller and drive-through systems.  Roller system  At a roller unit, the truck places each set of wheels on the rollers as it leaves the plant. At this point the washing process is automatically triggered. While the wheels of each axle are rotated automatically, water is sprayed out from strategically placed nozzles to clean the tires, wheel wells and mud flaps.  Drive-through system  The advantage of drive-through systems is that the vehicle does not have to stop for cleaning. As the vehicle passes the magnetic-sensor or photo-sensor at the entrance, the washing process is triggered. During the slow passage (5 mph speed) through the wash platform, the vehicle's tires, wheel wells and mud flaps are cleaned by water sprayed from many strategically placed nozzles (spray bar). The nozzles are mounted angle-iron grids which open the tire treads and flushing the mud for a high cleaning performance. The washing platform is usually of galvanized steel. The first modern systems were introduced as the MobyDick “Quick” series at a German construction industry trade exhibition. The Quick system was a significant design improvement from the modified high pressure truck wash systems that were used as wheel and tire wash systems before. Today all modern drive through systems are based on the engineering and design development of the Quick series. Technical aspects A key aspect of the philosophy of wheel and tire cleaning is the use of high volume water flow at low pressure. The high volume flow of water flow serves to clean the tires and effectively remove the wash sludge slurry from the wash platform into the recycling and solids collection tanks. Mist and overspray from high pressure systems would not be an effective method of cleaning and removing the wash sludge into the recycling and solids collections tanks. Other disadvantages of high pressure cleaning are wasted water, energy and obstruction of driver visibility. Recycling tank Once the wash sludge arrives to a recycling tank the solids typically sink by gravity to the bottom. To accelerate the sedimentation of the solids, flocculants are used. Periodically the settled solids at the bottom of the recycling tank are removed from the tank with an automatic scraper conveyor system or by other means such as a wheel loader, an excavator with bucket or a vacuum truck. After the solids settlement process the wash water is ready for the next washing cycle. The goal of the sedimentation process is to deliver clean and optically clear water for every wash.

It was also released as the B-side of the \\"London Town\\" single. In 2003 it was later released on the soundtrack to the film The In-Laws. Lyrics and music \\"I'm Carrying\\" is a gentle love song. Although Linda McCartney, Paul's wife, was a member of Wings, the song was not inspired by her but rather by a former girlfriend of Paul McCartney's. The song has a simple structure, with two verses and a refrain. In the first verse, McCartney sings that he will come to his lover's room after an absence bringing gifts and a carnation. In the second verse, he sings that he has been away for a long time and wonders if his return will lack style. The refrain simply notes that he is carrying something for his lover. \\"I'm Carrying\\" is in the key of E major and based on four chords. McCartney originally recorded the song accompanied by just his acoustic guitar during the London Town sessions aboard the stern of the yacht Fair Carol in the Virgin Islands on 5 May 1977. In December 1977, he overdubbed orchestral strings and he also overdubbed his own playing of an electric guitar using a Gizmo. The Gizmo is a device invented by 10cc members Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, which allows a guitar to be played by vibrating the strings rather than plucking them.

The historic district contains six buildings. Five of the buildings are collegiate buildings on the Drake University campus and one is a church. The period of significance is from when the university was founded in 1881 to the end of the presidency of Hill M. Bell in 1918. The historic district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988. It is part of the Drake University and Related Properties in Des Moines, Iowa, 1881—1918 MPS. History Francis Marion Drake The historic district comprises six buildings on the southeast corner of the Drake University campus. Five of the buildings belong to the university and other is a church complex. The importance of the district lies in the development of Drake University by the Disciples of Christ and the role the school and the church played in the development of this part of Des Moines. with The academic buildings also relate to the role of General Francis Marion Drake, who founded the school and was its major benefactor in its early years, and the progressive period of the school's early president Hill M. Bell. Drake University was established in 1881 and is the oldest institution of higher education in the city. Initially the Disciples of Christ held their services on the Drake campus. University Place Christian Chapel was organized in 1888 with 382 charter members. In 1977, Central Christian and University Christian Churches merged to form First Christian Church at this site. Old Main was the first building constructed in brick on the Drake campus. The other campus buildings in the historic district were built in the first decade of the 20th century. The present church building was constructed at the same time, and the adjoining education building was added in 1926. Drake University is no longer affiliated with the Disciples of Christ. Architecture Old Main, designed by C.B. Lakin, is the oldest building on the campus. Built from 1882-1883, it is a rectangular shaped, three-story brick Victorian building. The main façade features five gables, corbelled chimneys and a central bell tower. The bricks between the windows are set at an angle. Stone courses serve as lintels and sills. The windows in the center of the building are decorated with stone panels on top. In 1900 the auditorium was added to the back of the structure and a new main entrance was added to the front. Howard Hall was built in 1903 and the east wing was built five years later. A planned west wing was never built. The brick structure was built over a raised basement and features brick quoins, round- arch windows, continuous stone sills and lintels, shallow hipped roof and a small parapet. A large colored glass window contained music motifs, which relate to the buildings use by the Drake University Conservatory of Music. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Smith & Gage. Cole Hall was built to house the law school and law library in 1904. Also designed by Smith & Gage it is a two-story red brick structure with dark grey brick base and concrete trim. The center bay is slightly recessed. Like the other buildings, it features classical detail, brick quoining semi-circular pediment, and continuous sills. Memorial Hall was built for the Disciples of Christ Bible College in 1905. The three-story brick structure was built on a dark red-brown basement. The entryways slightly project forward. Unifying elements within the district include the rusticated brick for the high basement, continuous sills and lintels, concrete molding, concrete round- arched entries on the west and north, and classical detail. Smith & Gage was the architect. Carnegie Library built from 1907-08 represents the shift from a sectarian school, its progressive educational policies and its need for funding at a national level. It was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot & Bird. The brickwork in the building is multi-colored: pinkish-tan pilasters, panels between windows in gold and the base in dark red-brown brick. Like the other buildings, it features the restrained use classical motifs and a continuous sill. The building has a simple cornice with dentils across the top. University Christian Church or \\"First Christian Church\\" as it now named, was built in 1908 and the adjacent Education Building was built in 1926. The Education Building replaced the original 1890 University Place Christian Chapel. Proudfoot & Bird designed the church building and Burdette Higgins designed the Education Building. The church building, which has a seating capacity of 3,000 people, is similar to the later academic buildings in the Drake Historic District. The brick patterns on the exterior, however, are more elaborate. The two-story round arch entryways are not original to the building. The Education Building is a five-story tan brick structure with a corner bell tower. The exterior features Corinthian pilasters and arcades on the second floor and on the bell tower. Brick detailing includes both corbelling and dentils. The interior includes forty classrooms, gymnasium, church offices, chapel and fellowship hall. The second- floor chapel is a memorial to World War II dead.

It was recorded on the yacht Fair Carol in the Virgin Islands in May 1977; at the time Linda McCartney was pregnant with her and Paul's fourth child, James. Laine sings the lead vocal and both Laine and McCartney play acoustic guitar. Laine also plays the Spanish guitar solos.Luca Perasi, Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969-2013), L.I.L.Y. Publishing, 2013, , p.156 McCartney also plays bass guitar, and both he and Linda McCartney provide backing vocals. Lyrics and music \\"Deliver Your Children\\" is an uptempo song. Music professor Vincent Benitez and Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez describe it as being \\"folksy.\\" It is one of two songs on London Town primarily written by Laine with children as its theme. The verses describe a variety of unlucky experiences the singer has had, including getting caught in a rain storm, dealing with an unfaithful lover, and dealing with an unscrupulous repairman who can't fix his truck. Both Benitez and McCartney biographer John Blaney describe the verses as \\"rambling.\\" The refrain contrasts by exhorting the listener to deliver the children to the good life and make things right for them. According to Benitez, the song sounds as if it is in the key of A minor but the guitars are actually played in the key of D minor with a capo on the seventh fret. Actually, the verses are neither in a major or a minor key, but in a Dorian mode, which emphasizes their harsh imagery. The first two verses, the guitar solo near the end and the outro are in D-Dorian, while the last verses are in G-Dorian. The refrain is in C major, contrasting the verses and emphasizing its more hopeful lyrics. Reception Rolling Stone Magazine critic Janet Maslin described \\"Deliver Your Children\\" as \\"wonderful\\" and one of the best songs on London Town. Rodriguez regards it as the best of McCartney's and Laine's collaborations. Beatle biographers Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described it as \\"minor key Nashville chunkachuck\\" displaying \\"superior craftmanship.\\" Music critic Joel McNally regards it as a \\"good\\" song, describing it as \\"an upbeat number that dares to use some acoustic guitars in an electronic age. Author Giuseppe Rausa regards \\"Deliver Your Children\\" as one of the few memorable songs on London Town, describing it as a pleasant, quick, country music-like song.

Iamus is a computer cluster (a half- cabinet encased in a custom shell) located at Universidad de Málaga.

Iamus only composes full pieces of contemporary classical music. Iamus' Opus one, created on October 15, 2010 is the first fragment of professional contemporary classical music ever composed by a computer in its own style (rather than attempting to emulate the style of existing composers as was previously done by David Cope). Iamus's first full composition, Hello World!, premiered exactly one year after the creation of Opus one, on October 15, 2011. Four of Iamus's works premiered on July 2, 2012, and were broadcast live from the School of Computer Science at Universidad de Málaga as part of the events included in the Alan Turing year. The compositions performed at this event were later recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, creating the album Iamus, which New Scientist reported as the \\"first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians.\\" Commenting on the authenticity of the music, Stephen Smoliar, critic of classical music at The San Francisco Examiner, commented \\"What is primary is the act of making the music itself engaged by the performers and how the listener responds to what those performers do... what is most interesting about the documents generated by Iamus is their capacity to challenge the creative talents of performing musicians\\".

He is considered a member of Fluxus. He was a professor of aesthetics at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, the University of Applied Arts Vienna and the University of Wuppertal.  Career  Brock was born in Stolp, Pomerania, now in Poland. His father, a historian, was executed by the Soviets for collaborating with Hitler. The family fled to Denmark. After two years of internment, they settled in Itzehoe in 1947. Brock attended and graduated from the Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a gymnasium with a focus on the humanities, Latin and Greek. The name Bazon is Greek for chatterer and was applied to him at school by his Latin teacher. From 1957 to 1964, he studied German studies, art history, philosophy and political science at the universities of Zurich, Hamburg and Frankfurt. He did not study art at a university. During this period, he published poems and \\"Aktionslehrstücke\\" (plays), using \\"Bazon\\" as his pen name. In 1957, he trained as a dramaturge at the theater of Darmstadt and in 1960, began working at the Lucerne Municipal Theatre. Brock was a professor of \\"non-normative aesthetics\\" at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg from 1965 to 1976. From 1978, he was professor of the \\"theory of design\\" at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. In 1981, he was appointed professor of \\"aesthetics and cultural educations\\" at the University of Wuppertal, where he became professor emeritus in 2001. In 2010, Brock was a Fellow at the Kolleg Friedrich Nietzsche in Weimar. \\"death must be abolished ...\\" In the 1960s, Brock participated in happenings with Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell. In a 1968 exhibition, he showed a metal plate in the style of a high-voltage warning: \\"death must be abolished, this damned mess must stop. He who speaks a word of consolation is a traitor\\" (\\"der Tod muß abgeschafft werden, diese verdammte Schweinerei muß aufhören. Wer ein Wort des Trostes spricht, ist ein Verräter\\") and signed Bazon Brock. The text is a truncated version of his eulogy for Siegfried Kracauer, which continued, \\"betrays the solidarity of all human beings against death ... Death ... is a scandal, a beastly mess! ... Don't let yourselves submit to it, understand death ... [is] a monstrous scandal, against which I protest.\\") (\\"ist ein Verräter an der Solidarität aller Menschen gegen den Tod ... Der Tod ist ein Skandal, eine viehische Schweinerei! ... Lasst euch nicht darauf ein, versteht: der Tod ... [ist] ein ungeheuerlicher Skandal, gegen den ich protestiere.\\") Also in 1968, Brock installed a \\"Besucherschule\\" (visitors' school) at documenta IV, introducing exhibition visitors to contemporary art in several hours of \\"action teaching\\". The device was repeated several times until 1992. In 2006, he initiated a \\"Stadientournee des Live-Philosophierens\\" (stadium tour of live philosophy), entitled \\"Lustmarsch durchs Theoriegelände\\" (Zesty march through the terrain of theory). This was done in the style of the late 1980s, when the \\"Marsch durch Institutionen\\" (March Through Institutions) was started. This installation commemorating his 70th birthday was shown first at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, then at a number of museums, including the Schirn, Frankfurt, Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Von der Heydt Museum in Wuppertal and the Haus der Kunst in Munich. One of the photos shown is titled \\"Empedocles revised Mortal Philosopher embarrasses Mount Etna by throwing his shoes instead of himself into the crater\\" (1984). In 2009 he conducted action teaching in the Berlin Gropiusbau at the exhibition \\"Sixty years. Sixty works\\", commemorating the 60th anniversary of the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 2011, he introduced the exhibition \\"Trans- Skulptur\\" of his friends Anna and Bernhard Blume in Berlin. Brock's radio plays were published as tapes in the S-Press Tonband-Verlag, Cologne. A video documentary on his work is titled Ästhetik als Metatheorie – In zwanzig Kapiteln wird ein strukturierter Einstieg in die Denkwelt des KünstlerPhilosophen und GeistTäters gegeben (\\"Aesthetics as Meta-Theory: Presenting a Structured Introduction into the Sphere of Thought of the Artist Philosopher and Spirit/Mind Actor in Twenty Chapters.\\").

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. History Holy Trinity was built between 1829 and 1832, and was designed by Anthony Salvin. A grant of £3,423 (equivalent to £ as of ) was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission, the total cost of construction being £4,978. The interior of the church was re- ordered, and the chancel was added, by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin in 1880. The church was declared redundant on 1 October 1976, converted for use as a sports hall the following year, and further converted, this time for residential use, in 1996. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in limestone rubble with sandstone dressings, and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, north and south aisles, a chancel at a lower level, and a northwest tower with a spire. The tower has angle buttresses, pairs of lancet bell openings over which is a band of trefoils, and pinnacles at the corners. The aisle bays are separated by buttresses. The walls contain lancet windows, with doorways in the western bay on the south side, and in the fourth bay from the west on the north side. At the west end of the church is a doorway, above which is a triple stepped lancet window. There is another triple stepped lancet at the east end of the chancel, and windows with trefoil heads in its north and south walls. =Interior= Inside the church the five-bay arcades are carried on octagonal piers. In the chancel is a double sedilia and a piscina. The reredos is in marble and alabaster. In the north aisle are two windows containing stained glass, one by Morris, and the other, dating from about 1905, by Kempe. When the church was examined for listing in the mid-1990s, it was disused, its interior had been subdivided, and false ceilings had been inserted. The original three-manual organ had been built by Bellamy of Manchester. It was updated in 1853 by Jardine and company, also of Manchester, and rebuilt in 1958 by Rushworth and Dreaper.

It is arguably the first full-scale work entirely composed by a computer without any human intervention and automatically written in a fully-fledged score using conventional musical notation.http://www.eldia.es/2011-10-14/CULTURA/6-Keroxen-auna-coreografia- musica-escenario-Tanque.htm Iamus generates music scores in PDF and the MusicXML format that can be imported in professional editors such as Sibelius and Finale. Title The title makes reference to the computer program Hello World, which is traditionally used to teach the most essential aspects in a programming language. Dedication The composition is dedicated to the memory of Raymond Scott, an electronic music pioneer and inventor of the Electronium. Premiere \\"Hello World!\\" was given its premiere performance on October 15, 2011 by Trio Energio at the Keroxenhttp://www.amigosdeltanque.com/keroxen-2011 music festival in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain. The performers were Cristo Barrios (clarinet), Cecilia Bercovich (violin), and Gustavo Díaz-Jerez (piano). Reception As supported by neuroscientific studies, critiques of \\"Hello World!\\" (and similarly created works) could potentially be affected by anti-computer prejudice, derived from the fact of knowing in advance (or not) the non-human nature of the author. The music critic Tom Service of The Guardian acknowledged as much in his review of a 2012 performance, writing, \\"Now, maybe I'm falling victim to a perceptual bias against a faceless computer program but I just don't think Hello World! is especially impressive.\\" He continued: Despite describing the piece as \\"more successful than previous attempts to produce generic musical compositions from computers,\\" he added, \\"The real paradox of Iamus is why it's being used to attempt to fool humanity in this way. If you've got a computer program of this sophistication, why bother trying to compose pieces that a human, and not a very good human at that – well, not a compositional genius anyway – could write? Why not use it to find new realms of sound, new kinds of musical ideas?\\" Conversely, the musicologist Peter Russell was asked to review \\"Hello World!\\" for the BBC, based on a video of the live premiere, but he was not given any information about the composer. In his critique, Russell writes \\"on listening to this delightful piece of chamber music I could not bring myself to say that it would probably be more satisfying to read the score than listen to it. In fact after repeated hearings, I came to like it\\".

Its existence spanned 112 years from 1818 to 1930 when it was incorporated into the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1818, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) learned that Jean-Baptiste Rousseau (1780–1831), the French consul at Aleppo and Tripoli (then both part of the Ottoman Empire), was selling his extensive collection of manuscripts written in the Arabic script. In November of that year, the president of the RAS, Count Sergey Uvarov, wrote to the Board of the RAS requesting that a separate room be put aside in the Academy's cabinet of curiosities for storing this collection of manuscripts (which was eventually purchased by the RAS in two tranches, in 1819 and 1825), as well as other medals, manuscripts and books of oriental origin already in the Museum of the Imperial Academy of Science. The result was the establishment of the Asiatic Museum () of the RAS, in Saint Petersburg. Quarenghi-designed Neoclassical building wedged between the Kunstkammer and the Twelve Collegia The Asiatic Museum quickly established itself as the main institute for the collection and study of oriental manuscripts and books in Russia, as well as a major international centre for oriental studies, and by the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, almost a hundred years after its foundation, it housed one of the most extensive collections of oriental manuscripts and printed books in the world. Following the Russian Revolution, the Asiatic Museum continued under the same name until May 1930, when the Institute of Oriental Studies (IOS) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR was founded, and the Asiatic Museum was incorporated into this new institute.

The party is the Sudanese regional branch of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party in Sudan. While the branch has always been small, accounting for an estimated 1,000 members in 2003, it has been able to have a bigger impact than what its meager membership numbers would suggest, mostly due to Iraqi financing of the branch. After collaborating with the Arab nationalist Sudanese government for years, the Ba'ath Party broke off relations and became an opposition party in 1990; this would have disturbed Iraq if Sudan had not supported it during the 1991 Gulf crisis. In 1990, the party was composed largely of students who had studied in Ba'athist Iraq. The party, which was small in 1990, was influential in certain sectors, and was opposed to the National Islamic Front and was staunchly secularist. Members have historically been torn between the Ba'ath and other secular party movements, such as the Sudanese Communist Party. Despite Saddam Hussein's amicable relationship with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, the body ruling Sudan at the time, the Ba'ath branch was oppressed by the authorities. Later in 1990, 26 Ba'athi military officers were executed in Khartoum after a failed military coup. In 2002, a group led by Mohamad Ali Jadein broke away from the branch and established the independent Sudanese Ba'ath Party, which has no affiliation with either the Iraqi or the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party. The following year, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, 80 Sudanese Ba'athists were allowed to return to Sudan under the condition that they would stay out of politics.

It was implemented on the .NET Framework 1.0. The main new feature was managed code. Programmers familiar only with Visual Basic would probably have encountered difficulties working with the new version or adapting existing programs for it.  Obvious major differences  The new platform bore little resemblance to its predecessor. While programmers expected to be able to recompile their Visual Basic source to a .NET target, the reality of the situation was that Visual Basic .NET was a vastly different paradigm. Obvious syntax differences aside, Visual Basic .NET provides much the same functionality as C# (since they both compile down to MSIL, with the most obvious difference being the case insensitivity of Visual Basic .NET, maintaining the original case- insensitivity of Visual Basic), which is more of a problem for C# programmers trying to inter-operate with Visual Basic .NET developers than anything else. The basic syntax remains very similar: conditions, loops, procedures, sub- routines are declared and written in the same manner (see Visual Basic). Mobility from prior Visual Basic iterations to Visual Basic .NET really are parts of existing code: programmers with experience in both worlds are required to effectively target the new platform with older logic. The Visual Basic .NET developer will have to learn the use of the basic .NET types rather than what they have been used to in Visual Basic. A programmer who has only worked with Visual Basic may encounter a steep learning curve to migrate to Visual Basic .NET. A programmer who is versed in another language or who has had exposure to the .NET runtime should be able to cope. It would be better to think of Visual Basic .NET as a new language inspired by the classic Visual Basic rather than as a continuation of Visual Basic 6.0, with the added difficulty for migrating programmers that VB.NET interfaces with the .NET Framework whereas VB6 was based on the Component Object Model (COM).  More detailed comparison  There are some immediate changes that developers should take note of: = More C-like syntax = Visual Basic .NET allows for the \`+=\`, \`-=\`, \`*=\`, \`/=\`, \`\\\\=\`, \`^=\`, and \`&=\` compound operators so that longer lines like: variable = variable + 1 can now be written as: variable += 1 However, increment and decrement operators are not supported. = Short- circuited logic = In prior iterations of Visual Basic, all statements in a condition would have been evaluated even if the outcome of the condition could be determined before evaluating a condition. For example: If foo() And bar() Then ' code here is executed if foo() and bar() both return True, however, if foo() returns False, bar() is still evaluated End If This was not only inefficient, but could lead to unexpected results for any person used to another language. In Visual Basic .NET, the new AndAlso and OrElsehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wz3k228a.aspx operators have been added to provide short-circuit evaluation like many other languages. = Explicit pointer-like types are no more = Var* variable types are deprecated in Visual Basic .NET. The common runtime decides which types are reference types and which types are value types so this is no longer the domain of the programmer. = Properties: Let and Set = Class properties no longer require the Let and Set statements = Debug printing = DebugPrint is replaced with DebugWrite and DebugWriteLine = Procedures = A procedure call must have parentheses in Visual Basic .NET. Visual Basic .NET requires a ByVal or ByRef specification for parameters. In Visual Basic the specification could be omitted, implying ByRef by default. Most development environments, such as Visual Studio .NET, will automatically insert a ByVal, so in effect the default is ByVal, not ByRef. There are tools to convert Visual Basic code to VB.NET, such as the Visual Basic Upgrade Wizard that was included in Visual Studio .NET 2002 and 2003. Conversion tools automatically insert a ByRef if necessary, preserving the semantics of the Visual Basic application. = Zero- based arrays = Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0 has traditionally employed zero- based arrays (the default lower bound), unless \\"Option Base 1\\" is declared. This was the source of many out-by-one errors in Visual Basic programs, especially when dealing with interoperability across program library boundaries. Although the .NET Common Language Runtime can support arrays with any base value, Visual Basic .NET and C# provide only zero-based arrays and lists, and the .NET Common Language Specification requires zero-based arrays for interoperability between .NET languages. = Jagged Arrays = Visual Basic .NET introduced the concept of a jagged array, whereby the rows can have unequal length as opposed to the uniform length of arrays imposed on Visual Basic programmers. = Variant data type is gone = In languages compiling down to .NET platform, types are strict. Whilst the runtime allows for anonymous object which don't have a pre-defined, named type, the type of a variable may not change over the course of its life-time, hence the need to drop the Variant data-type. However, type \\"Object\\" has somewhat similar behavior in practice. = True object-oriented programming = Visual Basic was an object-based language. It supported classes, but not other concepts that would make it an object-oriented language. Visual Basic .NET is a true object-oriented language with the following features: # inheritance # function overloading Although no language targeting .NET allows for multiple inheritance for classes—multiple inheritance of interfaces is supported. = Change from COM to NET = Whilst the IDE does a reasonable job of hiding the fact, the dependence on ActiveX objects is dropped in Visual Basic .NET (although there are mechanisms for interfacing with COM in .NET http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645736(v=vs.71).aspx) in favour of .NET components offering similar functionality. This shift is good for the Visual Basic developer since much of the performance issues in Visual Basic arose around the cost of the COM interface. = Elementary geometry management via the Forms designer = One of the true banes of a Visual Basic developer's life has always been writing resize code. Whilst the WinForms paradigm leaves a lot to be desired in the geometry management department in the face of toolkits like Qt and GTK+, at least the developer can anchor widgets on forms instead of having to write reams of code in OnResize handlers. = Option Explicit by default = In Visual Basic .NET, Option Explicit is on by default.

In addition O'Brien has published several how to books related to diving and helped shape the sport into what it is today. Athletic career O’Brien began his athletic career similarly to many great divers, as a gymnast. Once in college at Ohio State University he earned six varsity letters in gymnastics and diving. In diving he went on to become NCAA national champion on 1 meter springboard (1959) and AAU national champion on 3 meter springboard (1961).O'Brien, Ronald F., and Ronald F. O'Brien. \\"Ron O'Brien Bio.\\" Springboard & Platform Diving. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2003. Print. After his college career, he worked as an acrobat in a professional water stunt show alongside fellow future dive coach Dick Kimball. In 1960, O'Brien placed third in the US diving Olympic trials, narrowly missing the top two qualification slots. Coaching career After his time as an athlete ended, O'Brien began coaching. Over the years, he has coached divers of all skill levels resulting in over 350 medals in elite dive meets all over the world. In total, the Olympians coached by O’Brien have won twelve gold, three silver, and four bronze medals.O'Brien, Ronald F. Ron O'Brien's Diving for Gold. Champaign, IL: Leisure, 1992. Print In addition to the vast number of medals his divers have won, O'Brien holds the record for producing at least one national champion in the most consecutive years with a 23-year streak from 1973 to 1995. Another of O'Brien’s coaching feats came in 1982 when his California divers took all four of the available gold medals at the world championships, marking the only time a dive club has ever swept a meet of such caliber. Lastly, O'Brien is the lead visionary for the website, diverstocollege.com, a service which helps high school divers get recruited. This service was created to make it easier for divers to get recruited because most online recruitment services cater to all sports. Honors and awards Because of his elite coaching career, O'Brien has been the recipient of some of the most prestigious awards in the sport of diving. Possibly the most notable of these awards is the \\"Outstanding Senior US Diving Coach Award.\\" O'Brien has been the only recipient of this award because he has won it every year since its creation in 1979. He has been inducted into the Ohio State Athletics, The International Swimming and Pennsylvania Sports Halls of Fame. He retired from active coaching in 1996 after having coached more champions than any coach in history. Because of his history as both an athlete and coach at Ohio State, the school’s diving well was named in his honor. Philosophy When training his divers, O'Brien emphasizes how important it is to master all of the small things before putting them together. This concept can be found in any of his publications in which he teaches how sound fundamentals and mental preparation are just as important as raw power and plenty of practice. Publications =Diving My Way= Diving My Way is an instructional diving video which breaks down the mechanics of diving using slow motion and picture- by-picture effects. The video is broken down into the categories: Body Alignment, Board Work, Basic Dives, Entries, Somersaulting, Twisting, and Platform Diving. =Ron O'Brien's Diving for Gold= Like his instructional video, Ron O'Brien's Diving for Gold breaks down the mechanics of each dive on 1 meter, 3 meter, and platform. The book also explains \\"O'Brien's winning formula for constructing the forward approach,\\" possibly the most critical building block for a diver’s mechanics. Along with discussing the basic mechanics of diving, the book talks about O'Brien's philosophy for how divers should mentally approach diving. The book contains illustrations for nearly every existing dive in every position possible. Retirement After retiring from coaching in 1996, O'Brien became the national technical director for USA Diving. He currently lives in Islamorada, Florida with his wife.

She continued her studies with Irina Lebedeva, as well as at the Boston Ballet and at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. After suffering a knee injury, Natalia took a step back from dance and pursued an economics degree from Wesleyan University. After graduation, Alonso joined Ballet Hispanico, directed by Tina Ramirez, based in New York City. With the company, Alonso performed both internationally and domestically, and in such notable theatres as the Kennedy Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Joyce Theatre, and New York City Center. In 2004, Ramirez offered Alonso a solo, Llamada, choreographed by the Kansas City Ballet's artistic director, William Whitener. When Whitener declined to allow Alonso to perform in the piece because he did not know her, she flew at her own expense to St. Louis, where his company was performing, to rehearse with him. He gave her his approval after just one afternoon: “She is a gifted artist who is completely invested in the process,” he said. “And like all the great ones,” he adds, “her feet are firmly planted on the ground.” In the piece Palladium Nights, Alonso was reviewed \\"as a flame on the dance floor; she also gives the most nuanced performance—wholeheartedly joyous when the music takes her, introspective when she dances alone onstage....\\" She remained a principal dancer of the company until 2008, \\"maturing into a highly versatile dancer distinguished by her long, clean, polished line; hip- swiveling bravado; and stunning stage magnetism.\\" In 2008, Alonso joined Complexions Contemporary Ballet, directed by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson. Natalia appeared the cover of the August 2008 edition of Dance Magazine, in which she explained her decision to transition from Ballet Hispanico to Complexions. On what caught her eye about Complexions, Alonso said \\"I was attracted to the style of repertory and its fusion of ballet with other types of contemporary dance styles and themes.\\" She said, while on tour with the company in Australia in 2009, \\"I am amazed by the calibre of each individual dancer and artist. The company has always been known for housing the world’s best dancers and the directors encourage excellence.\\" Because of her exposure to a number of different methods of dance, Alonso was able to quickly adapt to the physically demanding nature of Complexions' choreography. A review of Mirror Me, a creation of Juan Rodriguez, a guest choreographer, described Alonso's performance as such: \\"Alonso’s plies are particularly slow and decadent, as though she were a spoon slicing into warm pumpkin pie.\\" However, Complexions has not always been reviewed favorably, at one time described \\"a man’s world. The women are instruments; the men play them.\\"\\" The review goes on to describe the choreography as \\"far more monocultural than it claims to be. Its women are by no means only passive, but most of the partnering is grossly manipulative.\\" Alonso appeared on the Winter 2011 cover of Discount Dance Supply, one of the largest distributed dance supply catalogs in the United States. Alonso also appears in a digital short for the company. Discount Dance Supply conducted an interview with Alonso for the shoot, in which she describes how she became involved in dance, her favorite qualities, and the different styles each dancer brings to rehearsal. In February 2013, it was announced that Alonso was joining the cast of the play Nikolai and the Others.http://www.lct.org/showWhosWho.htm?id=216 Written by Richard Nelson (playwright) and directed by David Cromer, the play imagines the relationships between a close-knit group of Russian emigres, including choreographer George Balanchine (played by Michael Cerveris), composer Igor Stravinsky, and their \\"friends, lovers, wives and ex-wives, partners, supporters and dancer... at the time of their historic collaboration on the Orpheus.\\"http://www.lct.org/showMain.htm?id=216  Other notable work  Alonso has worked with other choreographers such as Alonzo King, Bradley Shelver, and George Faison while on tour with Aretha Franklin. She also has been a Gyrotonic instructor since 2005 and trains other dancers in strengthening techniques. She also appeared in Telemundo “Up Front” specials and in independent films. = Appearances = \\"Nikolai and the Others,\\" [February 2013 - (present)] # Complexions Contemporary Ballet, [August 2008 - 2012] # Ballet Hispanico of NY, (January 2001 - 2008) -- Former principal dancer, featured spokesperson in print and television adds works by Ann Reinking, Ramon Oller, Pedro Ruiz, Alex Magno, Sergio Trujillo # Bradley Shelver Contemporary Dance, [2004 - (present)] # Telemundo “Up Front”, (2004, 2005, and 2006) -- featured dancer with guest musical artists # Fringe Festival, (July 2000) -- appearing in works by Vickie Mendoza # Aretha Franklin Tour (1999) -- featured dancer, choreography by George Faison = Film and TV credits = # Setting the Stage, PBS(Special) (2007) -- private interview on behalf of Ballet Hispanico # Everything is One, Pete Francis- (Music Video) (2005) -- choreography by Sergio Trujillo, featured dancer and actress # Come Mute, directed by Cheryl Dunn (Film) (2003), featured dancer # Maine Merengue, (Film) (1999) -- directed by Ian Kornblooth, featured actress = Education and training = * Wesleyan University, (1996-2000) - B.A., Economics; Concentration in Dance * Alvin Ailey American Dance Center, (Summers 1996-99) * Boston Ballet School, (Summers 1994-95) * Irina Lebedeva Irina Lebedeva, (1993-1996) * Fedicheva Ballet School, (1987-1993) = Teaching experience = Alonso teaches, or has taught, ballet and modern techniques at the following schools: * Complexions Contemporary Ballet Summer Intensive (2009–11) * Two Worlds Dance - 2002–present * The Juilliard School - 2007 * Perry Mansfield Summer Program - 2006-2001 References Category:American ballerinas Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Actresses from New York City ","title":"Natalia Alonso"},{"id":"34581081","text":"Kamir Malmir (, also Romanized as Kamīr Mālmīr; also known as Komeyr and Kūh Mīr) is a village in Gol Gol Rural District, in the Central District of Kuhdasht County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

It lies in the Cottian Alps range. It has an elevation of 3,129 metres above sea level. Etymology Blackish ground near the summit. The name used on the Italian maps comes from Piedmontese \\"Bagnà\\" («wet»), which should derive from the look of the blackish fine ground nearby the summit. The French name comes from the \\"Grand Vallon\\", a secondary valley which starts from the mountain and goes northwards towards Charmaix and Modane.  Geography  In the French subdivision of western Alps it belongs to the Massif du Mont-Cenis while in the SOIUSA (International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps) it is part of the mountain group called \\"gruppo della Pierre Menue\\" (Italian) or \\"groupe de l'Aiguille de Scolette\\" (French). Administratively the mountain is divided between the Italian comune of Bardonecchia (southern face) and the French communes of Modane (north-western face) and Avrieux (north-eastern face).  Access to the summit  The easiest route for the summit starts from col du Fréjus, which connects Modane and Bardonecchia, then passes by punta del Fréjus and follows the south-western ridge of the mountain.

It was isolated and characterized in 1987 by Friedrich Widdel of the University of Konstanz (Germany). Like most sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), D. hydrogenophilus is capable of completely oxidizing organic compounds (specifically acetate, pyruvate and ethanol) to CO2, and therefore plays a key role in biomineralization in anaerobic marine environments. However, unlike many SRB, D. hydrogenophilus is a facultative lithoautotroph, and can grow using H2 as an electron donor and CO2 as a carbon source. D. hydrogenophilus is also unique because it is psychrophilic (and has been shown to grow at temperatures as low as ). It is also diazotrophic, or capable of fixing nitrogen. Cell structure Cells are elongated-oval shaped, and 1–1.3 by 2–3 μm in size. They are non-motile, gram-negative, and non-sporulating. Metabolism D. hydrogenophilus is the only described species of Desulfobacter that can grow chemolithoautotrophically. Using H2 as an electron donor and CO2 as a carbon source, D. hydrogenophilus reduces sulfate, SO42− (and also sulfite, SO32−, and thiosulfate, S2O32−) to sulfide, S2−. However, D. hydrogenophilus is a facultative lithoautotroph, and may also use acetate, pyruvate, or ethanol as both an electron donor and carbon source. A modified tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is employed for acetate metabolism and autotrophic growth. When D. hydrogenophilus is grown with either H2 or acetate, doubling time is less than 30 hours, but when grown with pyruvate or ethanol, doubling time is over 30 hours. The shortest doubling time observed on acetate was 18 hours. Butyrate cannot be used as an electron donor, and neither elemental sulfur, S0, nor nitrate, NO3−, can be used as electron acceptors. Fermentative growth has not been observed. Diazotrophic growth was observed in D. hydrogenophilus. Other Desulfobacter strains have also exhibited diazotrophic growth, but D. hydrogenophilus has exhibited the fastest diazotrophic growth rates of all the strains. D. hydrogenophilus’ doubling time with N2 as the nitrogen source was 36 hours, whereas other strains grew with a doubling time of 50 hours or more. Ecology Bridge over the Rio di San Giacomo dell'Orio in Venice The strain AcRS1, which was isolated for the enrichment culture used to describe the species in 1986, was taken from Rio di San Giacomo in Venice, Italy. D. hydrogenophilus is most commonly found in anoxic brackish or marine sediments, but has also been found in anoxic freshwater sediments and in activated sludge. D. hydrogenophilus is ecologically unique in that it has a wide temperature and pH range. Unlike any other species in its genus, D. hydrogenophilus is psychrophilic, or capable of growth and reproduction at cold temperatures. Slow growth on acetate with a doubling time of 5 weeks still occurred at 0 °C in an ice water bath. Its optimum growth temperature is , but growth occurs at temperatures of . Optimum pH is 6.6–7.0, but growth occurs at pH values of 5.5–7.6. Genome Guanine and cytosine were found to make up 44.6% of D. hydrogenophilus DNA sequences. Biomarkers The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) detected in D. hydrogenophilus consist of a wide variety of structures, including normal, branched and unsaturated FAME 14 to 19 carbon atoms long, with a greater variety of FAME when grown with acetate. Cis-9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid and 10-methylhexadecanoic acid have been considered biomarkers for D. hydrogenophilus. However, the relative amount of these fatty acids decreases substantially at cold temperatures. This has led to the concern about their reliability as biomarkers in cold environments, and has prompted further research in this area. The δ13C values of individual fatty acids can be useful for interpreting carbon utilization by D. hydrogenophilus in natural environments. Fatty acid δ13C values were more depleted relative to biomass under heterotrophic (−13.3‰) than under autotrophic (−11.8‰) growth conditions.

Grant The Lemuel P. Grant Mansion is a historic house located on St. Paul Avenue between Broyles and Grant streets in the Grant Park neighborhood of Atlanta. It is one of only three antebellum houses in the city of Atlanta still standing in their original locations. It is also by far the closest to what were in the 1860s the Atlanta city limits. The mansion was owned by Lemuel P. Grant, Atlanta's quintessential railroad man as well as a major landowner and civic leaderafter. Grant donated the land for Grant Park, which was named for him. The three-story, Italianate mansion was built in 1856. The house was constructed of buff stucco with wide walls, windows, nine fireplaces and a ballroom. Civil War Union troops did not burn the house during the burning of Atlanta in 1864, despite the fact that it had been used as a Confederate hospital, because they found Masonic paraphernalia in the house, and troops had been instructed not to harm the houses of Masons.\\"Grant Mansion\\", Grant Park Neighborhood Association 20th century In 1902, golf legend Bobby Jones was born here.

Beginning in the 1940s, neglect and fires damaged the mansions; it remained without its four porches and second story, and so part of the first floor was open to the elements.

Located in Homs Governorate, Rastan is a city of 60,000 residents. The FSA captured Rastan after days of intense fighting, according to residents and the opposition.  Battle  The first reports of major battles in Rastan were on 29 January 2012, after the Arab League mission and the subsequent cease fire, when three deserters were killed. A local activist in Rastan, who said the clashes lasted six hours, confirmed the toll. \\"A large number of soldiers in the countless checkpoints inside the city deserted and turned their arms on the regime's soldiers,\\" he said. \\"Residents are trying to help deserters fight their way out of Rastan and reach the positions of the Free Syrian Army,\\" added the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \\"There are regular small demonstrations in the streets, but only a few people come out because snipers are everywhere and the army is carrying out mass arrests every time there is a protest.\\" By the end of the day, an FSA video statement claimed that they controlled the city of 40,000 residents. However, the fighting continued. On 30 January, a defected first lieutenant said that the Hamza Battalion of the Khaled Brigade \\"routed regime forces from several neighborhoods in the western side of Rastan and vowed to continue fighting until the remaining neighborhoods were liberated\\". Their commander, Major Ali Ayyoub, confirmed this and said \\"The Assad army is on the defensive now. They are stranded in a few pockets. They only move forward after they receive reinforcements and the Free Syrian Army is always there to intercept their movements.\\" The Hamza Battalion claimed it had destroyed four army posts, two tanks, and several other armored vehicles. Activists posted a video of a destroyed tank that corroborates at least part of the FSA's claims. In the video, severe damage can be seen on the surrounding buildings. Still residents seemed buoyed by the successes of the FSA. An online video was posted of a protest held \\"under the protection of the Free Syrian Army\\". Activists reported that five civilians were killed by loyalists who shelled the city during the battle. Maj. Ayyoub refused to disclose how many FSA soldiers were participating in the defense of the city, citing security reasons, but he had put the number in the hundreds. The next day, on 31 January, defectors gained full control of the city, according to a town activist. Loyalist tanks were still able to shell the city, one such attack killing 10 civilians and wounding 15 others when a building was brought down. Local activists also claimed that 20 more had been killed during the battle, with the bodies being put in a mosque with the victims of the building being destroyed. On 1 February, more fighting in the town reportedly left 15 defectors and two soldiers dead. On 5 February, the FSA declared Rastan \\"liberated\\". A leader of an opposition battalion said that 42 people were killed in the city of Rastan in the previous days. Aftermath During an artillery attack on 9 February, FSA colonel Jihad Muhammad Ahmad was killed. On 13 February, government tanks attempted to push into the town of Rastan. However, they were repelled by the Free Syrian Army and at least three soldiers were killed. After retaking the Baba Amr district in Homs, in an assault where 700 rebels and civilians were killed according to Human Rights Watch, security forces began to intensively shell the town of Rastan. It was reported that at least 12 civilians, including many children, were killed by the shelling. On 4 March, seven civilians, including four children, were killed by government shelling. The victims included six family members killed when a rocket slammed into their home, alleged the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which claimed intensive shelling of Rastan throughout the day. 15 rockets were reported to have fallen in 15 minutes. A staff general of the army announced his defection on 6 March because of the army's shelling of Rastan. He posted a video, in which he showed his identification card and was flanked by other officers and stated: :\\"I declare my defection from the Syrian Army to the Free Syrian Army, because of the artillery bombing against Rastan which is continuing violently. Houses have been damaged and children and women were killed. This is not the right behaviour of the Syrian Army, and that's why I declare my defection to the Free Syrian Army. Long live free Syria.\\" A week later, on 16 March, two civilians were killed by government shelling. On 27 March, three members of the military were killed when the government tried to enter Rastan but were repelled. Three days later, two brigadier generals defected to the FSA in Rastan. Videos showed the generals announcing their allegiance to the Free Syrian Army while showing their military identification cards. On 14 May, activists reported that shells had rained down on Rastan at the rate of one shell per minute. Nine people were killed in the bombardment. Among the dead was a local rebel commander. In response, opposition fighters attacked three armoured vehicles carrying government troops as they were heading to Rastan, reportedly killing 23 soldiers. In late May, a BBC reporter within the city reported that the rebels were locked in constant street fighting with the government forces which were responding with sporadic artillery shelling.

In a career that lasted from April to October 1799 he ran four times and won two races. On his second racecourse appearance he won The Derby defeating his more fancied stable companion, Eagle. Archduke was beaten in two races at Newmarket later that year and did not race again. He was later exported to stand at stud in the United States. Background Archduke was a brown horse bred by his owner Sir Frank Standish of Duxbury. Archduke's sire, Sir Peter Teazle (or simply \\"Sir Peter\\") won the Epsom Derby in 1787 and became the most successful stallion of the time, winning the title of Champion sire on ten occasions between 1799 and 1809. Archduke was the tenth foal of Horatia, a highly successful broodmare, who had previously produced the double Doncaster Cup winner Stamford and went on to produce the 1806 Derby winner Paris, both sired by Sir Peter . Racing career =1799: three-year-old season= Until 1946 British racehorses did not have to be given an official name when racing and the colt who later became Archduke was unnamed for his debut on 10 April 1799. Running as \\"Sir F. Standish's c. by Sir Peter out of Horatia\\", he ran in a 100 guinea Sweepstakes at the Newmarket Craven meeting. He was made 6/4 favourite and won from Lord Grosvenor's John Bull filly and two others. The colt was officially named Archduke when he appeared at Epsom for the Derby on 9 May. His stable companion, Sir Frank Standish's \\"Brother to Spread Eagle\\" (later named Eagle) was the even money favourite, while Archduke was a relative outsider at odds of 12/1 in a field of eleven runners. Ridden by the veteran jockey John Arnull, Archduke won from Lord Egremont's Precipitate colt, with Eagle only third and Vivaldi fourth. The result was similar to the 1796 race, in which Standish's Didelot won the race with his favoured stablemate Mr. Teazle unplaced. After a break of well over four months, Archduke returned for the autumn meetings at Newmarket, where he had three engagements. On 30 September he started favourite for a Sweepstakes over the two mile \\"Ditch In\\" course, but finished third of the four runners behind Chippenham and Buzzard. Eagle finished last. Two days later, Archduke ran in the Town Plate over the same course and finished last of the three runners behind Hornby Lass and Humbug. This proved to be his last racecourse appearance: he was withdrawn from a valuable Sweepstakes on 14 October (won by Eagle), and from a scheduled match race against Mr Heathcote's horse Schedoni at Newmarket the following April. Stud career After two seasons at stud in England, Archduke was sold in 1803 to John Hoomes and exported to stand as a stallion in Virginia. Before he was exported he sired Roseden, who became a successful sire in Ireland. After the death of Hoomes in 1805, Archduke was sold and stood in 1807 in Chesterfield County, Virginia for Thomas Branch. Pedigree *Archduke was inbred 3x4 to Blank, meaning that this stallion appeared in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4x4 to Regulus.

Prepared by the National Academy for State Health Policy for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, June 2001 In the mid-1980s, states began enrolling beneficiaries in their PCCM programs in an attempt to increase access and reduce inappropriate emergency department and other high cost care. Use increased steadily through the 1990s.  History  In 1981, the 97th session of Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) which allowed state Medicaid programs to implement risk-based managed care programs as well as PCCM, pending HCFA (now known as CMS) waiver approval. The state had to meet two requirements in order to be granted HCFA approval. * The case management restrictions must not \\"substantially impair access\\" to primary care services of \\"adequate quality where medically necessary\\"; and * The case management restrictions must be \\"cost effective\\".Deborah A. Freund, Medicaid Reform: Four Studies of Case Management (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1984). In their earliest forms, PCCM programs closely resembled traditional fee-for-service Medicaid than managed care. Some states developed PCCM as a first step towards risk-based managed care and considered their MCO contracts as the main managed care system. As PCCM programs matured, state goals have expanded to improving quality of care provided. States have used strategies similar to network management principles used by MCOs. PCCM programs have evolved over the past two decades through the addition of a variety of care management and care co-ordination features. These include payment innovations, increased care management resources, improved performance monitoring and reporting, increased resources for management of serious and complex medical conditions and a variety of \\"medical home\\" innovations including performance-based reimbursement, better use of information technology, increased contact with patients and efforts to provide additional resources for physician offices.  Intent  By 1986, seven states had implemented PCCM programs.Maren D. Anderson, Peter D. Fox, \\"Lessons Learned from Medicaid Managed Care Approaches\\", Health Affairs 6, no. 1 (spring 1987): 71–88. By 1990, that number had grown to 19.Horvath, J. and N. Kaye (eds), Medicaid Managed Care: A Guide for States, 2nd edition. Portland, Maine: National Academy for State Health Policy, 1995. States were motivated to implement PCCM programs for several reasons. * States wanted to increase access to health care. State officials tried giving participating physicians a small payment to encourage physicians to accept more Medicaid beneficiaries. Each beneficiary would choose or be assigned a participating physician who would serve as his/her medical home. * States felt physicians would like PCCM more than risk-based managed care. * States hoped to save money by eliminating unnecessary or inappropriate emergency department and specialist visits, lab tests, and other high-cost care. * States thought PCCM would be well-suited for rural areas where MCOs have difficulty maintaining an adequate population base for financial viability.  Prevalence of PCCM  On July 1, 2010, approximately 21% of the almost 39 million Medicaid enrollees who were enrolled in a comprehensive managed care plan were enrolled in a PCCM program.Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care Plans by Type. Accessed January 29, 2012 * These 8 million consumers participate in PCCM programs in 31 states. * There are 11 states which offer PCCM as the only managed care option. *Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana have the largest PCCM programs, each with over 700,000 enrollees. * Approximately 30 percent of SCHIP enrollees are served by PCCM systems.VanLandeghem K and Brach C, \\"Impact of primary care case management (PCCM) implementation on Medicaid and SCHIP\\", CHIRI Issue Brief No. 8. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. March 2009. AHRQ Pub. No. 090020.  Organization of PCCM programs  In most PCCM programs, PCPs are paid a per member per month fee for each Medicaid beneficiary or an increase in preventive service fees to pay for case management services. In addition, PCPs are paid on a fee-for- service reimbursement for all primary care services that he/she provides. HMOs are not involved. In return, the PCP is responsible for providing primary care and for prior authorizations to hospitals and specialty care providers.Complete information about the BBA and Medicaid managed care, including the actual text and a series of letter to states from HCFA (now known as CMS) regarding the BBA, is available at Physicians bear no financial risk for the services they provide or approve. State Medicaid agencies may include additional activities, such as medical management, network management or performance incentives, to improve outcomes and generate cost savings.Neva Kaye, \\"PCCM Contracting and Quality Monitoring\\", Medicaid Managed Care: A Guide for States (second edition) (Portland, ME: National Academy for State Health Policy, 1995), 115-135 States vary in how they manage provider networks, provider recruitment, data collection and analysis, monitoring, quality improvement, patient education, disease management programs and enrollment. Some states perform all these programs in-house using state employees; other states contract out all or some of these functions.Silberman P, Poley S, Slifkin R. \\"Innovative Primary Care Case Management Programs Operating in Rural Communities: Case Studies of Three States\\". Accessed August 18, 2006  Scientific evidence  States that have tried implementing PCCM programs have encountered mostly positive results. * PCCM has been shown to improve patient outcomes.

Liverpool Football Club was formed on 15 March 1892 following a disagreement between the directors of Everton Football Club and its president, John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. A dispute over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C., and they joined the Lancashire League. After winning the league title in their first season, Liverpool were accepted into the Football League for the 1893–94 season, following the resignations of Accrington and Bootle. The appointment of Tom Watson as the club's manager in 1896 led to the club's first period of sustained success. Liverpool consolidated their position in the Football League following promotion to the First Division, and won their first League championship in 1901. A further championship followed in 1906, and in 1914 the club reached their first FA Cup final, losing to Burnley. Watson died suddenly in 1915 of pneumonia after the outbreak of the First World War. The club won two further championships in 1922 and 1923 when football resumed after the war. An expansion to the Spion Kop terracing in the 1920s increased Anfield's capacity. Liverpool's fortunes declined during the inter-war years, when the club often finished in midtable. Liverpool became League champions again in 1947, in the first season after the Second World War, but following a slow downturn in performance the club was relegated to the Second Division in 1954. By the time of Shankly's appointment in 1959, Liverpool had been in the Second Division for five seasons. Formation alt=The original white and blue shirt and white shorts that Liverpool wore upon their foundation until 1894. Liverpool's origins lie with their neighbours Everton. Founded in 1878, Everton moved to Anfield in 1884, a facility owned by the club's president, John Houlding, a former Lord Mayor of Liverpool. In 1892 a dispute arose between Houlding and the Everton board of directors, over the club's tenancy of the ground. The annual rent had risen from £100 in 1884 to £250 in 1892; Houlding wanted to sell the ground to the club, which in turn wished to agree a long-term rental. Houlding would only agree to this on the basis of a rent at a level unacceptable to the club. Negotiations having failed, the directors decided to leave Anfield and find another ground, leaving Houlding with an empty stadium. His response was to form a new football club to occupy the stadium. He attempted to retain the team name \\"Everton\\" by registering the name \\"Everton Football Club and Athletic Grounds Company, Limited\\" with Companies House, but the Football League decided that the name belonged to the departed Everton club, which acquired new premises at Goodison Park. Houlding therefore adopted the name \\"Liverpool Football Club\\" for his new venture. Having established his new club, Houlding applied for membership of the First Division of the Football League, rather than the newly formed Second Division. The League, unimpressed with this premature application, refused to admit the club, which instead joined the Lancashire League. Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players – the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland – so they became known as the \\"team of Macs\\". Liverpool's first match in the Lancashire League, which they won 8–0, was against Higher Walton. 200 spectators attended the match, but as the twenty-two match season proceeded, and Liverpool continued to win, attendances increased. Approximately 2,000 people watched Liverpool defeat South Shore in the penultimate match of the season at Anfield. Liverpool's first season was successful, as the club narrowly won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They also won the Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, mainly because of the resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts, similar to those of their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts. The club's first match in the Football League was against Middlesbrough Ironopolis on 2 September 1893, which they won 2–0, with Malcolm McVean scoring Liverpool's first goal in League football. Liverpool's first season in the Football League saw them unbeaten in 28 matches, 22 of which they won. They finished at the top of the Second Division, but as at that time there was no automatic promotion to the First Division, they were entered into the test match system. This involved a knockout match with the bottom team in the First Division, Newton Heath (later renamed Manchester United). Liverpool won, and took their place in the First Division. Their stay in the division lasted only a season, as they finished in bottom position, with seven wins from thirty matches. They were relegated to the Second Division, after facing Bury in the test match and losing 1–0, despite Bury playing most of the match with ten men after their goalkeeper was sent off. Consolidation As more people began to watch Liverpool, the ground capacity was expanded. The Main Stand was built, which helped to bring regular attendances of around 20,000. Liverpool's stay in the Second Division was brief, as they secured promotion to the First Division during the 1895–96 season – twelve wins in their final fourteen matches gave them a first-place finish, followed by success in the test matches over Small Heath (later renamed Birmingham City) and West Bromwich Albion. The club reached the semi- final of the FA Cup for the first time in the 1896–97 season; they were drawn against Aston Villa, and with Everton in the other semi-final, there was the prospect of a first all-Merseyside cup final. However, while Everton won their tie, Liverpool were defeated 3–0. After winning promotion, the club appointed Tom Watson, who was managing Sunderland, as their new manager. Watson's record of three League championships in four seasons with Sunderland convinced Houlding to make Watson the highest-paid manager in England, with a yearly salary of £300. alt=A black and white photograph of a man in a buttoned top During the next two seasons Liverpool consolidated their place in the First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0. Liverpool won their first League championship in 1901. Integral to their success were their captain Alex Raisbeck, and striker Sam Raybould. Raisbeck, a centre-half, had been signed from Hibernian in 1898. He became club captain a year later, and was often the focal point of the team, as an important defensive player and the instigator of many of Liverpool's attacks. Raybould was signed from local club New Brighton Tower, and in the 1899–1900 season scored seven times as the club won nine of their last eleven matches, to finish in tenth place. He would go on to score 128 goals in 226 matches for Liverpool. Success in the 1900–01 season looked unlikely in February, at which point Liverpool had lost eight games and conceded 31 goals. However, they won nine and drew three of their next twelve matches, while only conceding four goals, to achieve their first League title. They were less successful in the following two seasons, finishing in eleventh and fifth places respectively. The 1903–04 season saw the club relegated to the Second Division; like the previous relegation it was only for one year as they won the division the following season. On their return in the 1905–06 season they became the first team to win the Second and First Division in successive seasons. They also reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, where they faced Everton and lost 2–0. Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the ownership of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered to give up the 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club. Following the club's successes, a new stand was erected along the Walton Breck Road end of the ground. The stand became known as the Spion Kop – it was originally given this name by local journalist Ernest Edwards, the sports editor of the Liverpool Daily Post and the Echo, after a famous hill in South Africa, where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War. More than 300 men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. In the seasons following their second league title, Liverpool enjoyed limited success, generally finishing in midtable. They finished in second place behind Aston Villa in the 1909–10 season, the last for their captain, Raisbeck, who returned to his native Scotland to play for Partick Thistle. Liverpool's form declined after his departure, with their best performance in the League a 12th-place finish in the 1912–13 season. There was improvement in 1914 when the club reached their first FA Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to Burnley at Crystal Palace. The following season four Liverpool players were implicated in the 1915 British football betting scandal, which involved a match with Manchester United. A 2–0 victory for United was required to win the bet, in which players from both sides were involved. With the score at 2–0, Liverpool's Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar with a shot, at which several of his teammates gestured angrily towards him. Subsequently, Tom Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were found guilty by a Football Association (FA) enquiry of conspiring with three Manchester United players (Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West) to fix a United win. All the players involved were banned for life. Following the end of the First World War, in which Turnbull was killed at the Battle of Arras in 1917, the FA lifted the surviving players' bans in recognition of their service in the conflict. Inter-war years Three weeks after visiting his hometown of Newcastle to celebrate his 56th birthday, Liverpool's manager Tom Watson developed a severe chill, which developed into pneumonia. He died on 6 May 1915; Raisbeck and two other former Liverpool stars, Ned Doig and Arthur Goddard, were pallbearers at the funeral. During the First World War, with normal Football League activity suspended, Liverpool competed in a regional league, the Lancashire Section. The competition was split into two parts: \\"Principal Tournament\\" and the \\"Supplementary Competition\\". Liverpool won the former in the 1916–17 season, and the latter in the 1917–18 and 1918–19 seasons. A number of Liverpool players fought in the war, including Philip Bratley, Robert Crawford and Wilfred Bartrop. Bartrop was the only one to be killed, dying on 7 November 1918 while fighting in Belgium. alt=A black and white photograph of a man holding a ball When football resumed after the war for the 1919–20 season, Watson's post as manager was taken by David Ashworth. Liverpool finished in fourth place. During the season George V became the first reigning monarch to watch a League match, when Liverpool played Manchester City. Liverpool repeated their fourth-place finish in 1920–21. Another Scottish defender, Donald McKinlay, was given the captaincy from January 1922 to 1928.Donald Mackinlay, LFC History Liverpool regained the League championship in the 1921–22 season. Liverpool had looked certain title winners, before the loss of three of their last six games put their chances in doubt. A 4–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the last match of the season was enough to secure Liverpool's third League championship. Ashworth left Liverpool midway through the following season, to manage Oldham Athletic – he wished to be closer to his wife and daughter, who lived in nearby Stockport. His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen, a club director. McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment, but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship. This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.\\"Harry Chambers\\" LFChistory.net Following their successive championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined as their side aged. Some of the players had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott had been in the side since 1912. The club began the 1923–24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth place. They achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the offside rule in the 1925–26 season resulted in an increase in the number of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish. In 1920, the Kop had been redesigned and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. At the time, the Kop was the biggest football stand in the country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; they scored 90 goals during the 1928–29 season, striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident. He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson. The club's fortunes did not improve under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at West Ham United, yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7–2 at Anfield. During the 1930s Liverpool's form continued to deteriorate, and they avoided relegation in the 1933–34 season by only four points. Scott left the club at the end of what had been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper. In ten matches from the start of 1934, Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal, and after a 9–2 defeat against Newcastle United, he was replaced by Arthur Riley. The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form, with a 6–2 victory over Birmingham City and a 4–1 win against Middlesbrough. Scott, who joined Belfast Celtic after 24 years at Liverpool, remains the club's longest-serving player. As they became used to finishing in the lower part of the league table, Liverpool began to lose their best players. Hodgson, who had scored 233 goals in 358 league games, was sold to Aston Villa in 1936 and the club struggled to replace him. They finished 19th in the season following his departure. Also in 1936, Patterson resigned as manager for health reasons, and resumed his role as the club's secretary. His replacement, Southampton manager George Kay, did not initially fare much better; Liverpool narrowly avoided relegation in the 1936–37 season, and finished in 11th place in each of the following two seasons. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Liverpool had become accustomed to finishing midtable. Soon after the outbreak of war in 1939, the 1939–40 season was cancelled and all first-class football in Britain temporarily suspended. When matches resumed, competitions were played on a regional basis as in the previous war, and teams often did not complete a full season. Liverpool participated in the Football League North, which they won in the 1942–43 season. Many footballers served in the armed forces, away from their clubs for long periods, and would often appear as \\"guests\\" for other clubs. Two Liverpool players were decorated for their wartime service; Berry Nieuwenhuys received the Czech Medal of Merit, and Bill Jones was awarded the Military Medal after rescuing wounded comrades under fire. Post-war champions then decline League football in England resumed in the 1946–47 season, after seven seasons' suspension due to the war. Before the resumption, Liverpool embarked on an eight-week tour of the United States and Canada, scoring 70 goals in the ten matches played. In escaping from post-war food rationing while on tour, the Liverpool players were able to eat more, and by the end of the trip had gained in weight an average of a man. The New York Times reporter who followed the team on the tour noted the \\"perceptible gain in strength on the playing field.\\" The first game played at Anfield after the war was against Middlesbrough, on 4 September 1946, which Liverpool lost 1–0 before a crowd of 34,140. Despite this defeat, Liverpool finished the 1946–47 season as League champions captained again by a Scot, Willie Fagan.\\"Captains for Liverpool FC since 1892\\" Vital to this success were their attacking players; after a 5–0 defeat to Manchester United the club bought Albert Stubbins from Newcastle United, to augment the attack alongside Jack Balmer and Billy Liddell. Stubbins and Balmer joined top scored with 24 league goals and Balmer scoring hat-tricks in three successive matches. The club were unable to match this success in the two seasons that followed, and finished in 11th and 12th places respectively. The 1949–50 season brought another disappointing league campaign. The season started well, as the club was unbeaten in their first 19 matches and was top of the league at the turn of the year. Their form declined thereafter, and they finished eighth. This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup, as they reached their second final (their first at Wembley), against Arsenal. They were unable to win their first FA Cup; two goals from Arsenal striker Reg Lewis meant Liverpool lost 2–0. After their FA Cup final appearance, Liverpool's fortunes declined steadily. Kay resigned through ill-health, and was replaced by Don Welsh. Welsh's first season did not go smoothly, as Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Norwich City of the Third Division South. The following year, 61,905 spectators watched Liverpool beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–1 in the fourth round of the FA Cup, the biggest attendance ever recorded at Anfield. Under Welsh's stewardship the club gradually slipped further down the table, and were relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season, after finishing in bottom place. Their relegation came after 50 uninterrupted years in the top division of English football. Liverpool's first season in the Second Division in 1954–55 brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club suffered the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the following season they improved to third place, it was not enough for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked at the end of the season. His replacement was Phil Taylor, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and Jimmy Melia, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to non-League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the 1959–60 season; after a good start, their form began to tail off mid-season, and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, Bill Shankly.

Early life Ian Dennis was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire. YouTube While living at a youth hostel, Dennis began making art videos using a variety of materials - including coffee, toothpaste, junk mail, jams, and soil. Dennis then began making videos as \\"Fox Bronte,\\" a character based on the stereotypical \\"mad artist.\\" Using humour and a surreal editing style, his channel quickly grew in both popularity and controversy, with Fox Bronte regularly taking his clothes off to create. Other videos included him using his penis, his vomit, and condoms. In January 2010, he drank different coloured juices to change the colour of his urine - to create a portrait of British National Party leader Nick Griffin. Ian Dennis's latest channel \\"monalisanaked\\" follows on from his previous work. His videos attract a cult audience to the website. Other works In 2012, Dennis set up a prank appearance on Britain's Got Talent. As Fox Bronte he painted the hosts, Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly on his buttocks.

Born in Pruzhany, Samuel Soloveichik was the second son of Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. He was the brother of rabbis Joseph Soloveitchik (1903-1993) and Ahron Soloveichik (1917-2001). He had two sisters, Mrs. Shulamith Meiselman (1912-2009), and Mrs. Anne Gerber (1915-2011). After engaging in talmudic studies with his father, Soloveichik studied mathematics and science.* Shulamith Soloveitchik Meiselman, The Soloveitchik Heritage: A Daughter's Memoir (1995)Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff, From Washington Avenue to Washington Street , (2011) In 1934 he received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Brussels, graduating magnum cum laude.https://www.nytimes.com/1967/02/27/archives/dr-samuel-soloveichik-is- dead-chemistry-professor-at- yeshiva.html?sq=Samuel%2520soloveichik&scp;=1&st;=cse In 1939 he emigrated to the United States. During the Second World War Soloveichik worked as a research chemist for the Board of Chemical Warfare and the Board of Economic Warfare. In 1950, he received a Research Fellowship at Yeshiva University becoming Lecturer in Chemistry in the University's Chemistry Department in 1953. From 1959 until his death he was Associate Professor of Chemistry. He was a member of the American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Soloveichik died aged 58 on February 25, 1967, at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York. He was survived by his wife Bathsheba Ziv, a teacher at the Beis Yaakov-Beis Miriam High School in the Bronx, and his four siblings. His older brother Rabbi Joseph Ber Soloveitchik delivered a brief eulogy at his funeral, as did Yeshiva University President, Dr. Samuel Belkin. The main eulogy, lasting close to two hours, was delivered by his younger brother, Rabbi Ahron Soloveitchik. The Dr. Samuel Soloveichik Prize in Natural Science was established at Yeshiva University in his memory. Aliphatic Organic Compounds In a paper published in 1966, Soloveichik proposed a means of classifying aliphatic compounds similar to the periodic table. Prior to publishing the paper he discussed its contents with the chemist Linus Pauling in August–September 1955.http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/calendar/1955/08/ History of Chemistry Soloveichik was an expert and frequently lectured and wrote in the field of the History of Chemistry. In a series of papers he attributed the premature deaths or illnesses of the chemists Joseph Priestley, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Humphry Davy, William Cruickshank (chemist) and James Woodhouse to chemical poisoning. Science and Torah In lectures at Yeshiva University Soloveichik discussed the relationship between science and Torah with regard to issues such as the age of the earthLeon M. Mozeson Echoes of the Song of the Nightingale: The Torah as Divine Document (1991) and whether the earth orbits the sun or vice versa.
